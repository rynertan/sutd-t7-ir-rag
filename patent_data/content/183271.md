## Description
LYSIN DERIVATIVE AND PROTEINASE INHIBITOR BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a novel lysine derivative or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. More specifically, it relates to anL lysine derivative having a proteinase inhibition activity e.g., plasmin inhibition activity or the pharmaceutical acceptable salt thereof and a proteinase inhibitor containing the same as an essential component. 2. Description of the Related Art It is well known in the art that various proteinases are present in human organisms. Examples of such proteinases are plasmin, thrombin, trypsin, kallikrein, and urokinase. As is known, when these proteinases are abnormally activated, various diseases are caused. For example, when abnormally activated plasmin is present in a relatively large amount in the blood, hemorrhagic disorder or inflammatory disorder are caused. For this reason, a substance capable of exhibiting a proteinase inhibition activity is useful as a clinical remedy or medicine. It has been reported in, for example, J. Biol.Chem. 208, 85 1954 and J. Biochem., 57, 450 1965 that certain derivatives of lysine and arginine have an inhibition activity against plasmin, which is a proteinase specific to fibrin and fibrinogen in blood.However, the plasmin inhibition activity of the reported substances is low and, therefore, practical use of those substances as a medicine is not acceptable in the art. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a novel compound having an effective proteinase inhibition activity suitable for use as a proteinase inhibitor such as plasmin inhibitor. Other objects and advantages of the present inven tion will be apparent from the following description. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a lysine derivative having the general formula A Y Lys B L form A wherein A representsEMI2.1 EMI2.2 wherein X and X independently represent hydrogen, halogen, alkyl preferably having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl preferably having 5 to 8 carbon atoms, alkoxy preferably having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, aryloxy preferably having 6 to 10 carbon atoms, dialkylamino preferably having a C1 to C5 alkyl group, alkylcarbonylamino preferably having a C1 to Cg alkyl group, arylcarbonylamino preferably having a C6 to C10 aryl group, and n is an integer of 3 to 6, n2 is an integer of 1 to 3, and n3 is an integer of 0 to 3 Y represents SO2 or CO Lvs representsEMI3.1 B represents NR1R2, B represents NRÚRê, NZW, or tetrahydroquinolyl wherein RÚ and Rê independently represents hydrogen provided that both R and R cannot be hydrogen at the same time alkyl preferably having 1 to 6 carbon atoms substituted with carboxyl, alkoxycarbonyl preferably having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, phenyl, hydroxyphenyl, or benzoyl cycloalkyl preferably having 5 to 8 carbon atoms, which may be substituted with arylcarbonyl preferably having a C6 to C10 aryl group cycloalkyl alkyl preferably having 6 to 11 carbon atoms, which may be substituted with carboxyl, arylcarbonyl preferably having a C6 to Clo aryl group, or aralkyloxycarbonyl preferably having a C7 to C11 aralkyl group phenyl which may be substituted with halogen, nitro, cyano, trifluoromethyl, alkyl preferably having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, alkoxy preferably having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyl preferably having 2 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonylalkyl preferably having 3 to 10 carbon atoms, phenylalkyl preferably having 7 to 10 carbon atoms which may be further substituted with dialkylamino preferably having a C1 to C3 alkyl group, alkylcarbonyl preferably having a C1 to C10 alkyl group, phenylalkenyl preferably having 8 to 10 carbon atoms which may be further substituted with dialkylamino preferably having a C1 to C3 alkyl group, phenoxy, phenylcarbonyl which may be further substituted with amino1 dialkylamino preferably having a C1 to C3 alkyl group, alkoxycarbonyl preferably having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, or nitro, pyridylmethyl, phenyl hydroxyalkyl preferably having aC1 to C3 alkyl group, alkylsulfonyl preferably having aC1 to C20 alkyl group, or alkoxycarbonyl alkylaminocarbonyl preferably having 4 to 6 carbon atoms coumaryl which may be substituted with alkyl preferably having 1 to 5 carbon atoms quinolyl adamantyl norbornyl or tetrahydronaphthyl and Z isEMI4.1 orEMI4.2 W is hydrogen hydroxyl carboxyl amino carbonyl alkyl preferably having 1 to 10 carbon atoms alkoxycarbonyl preferably having 2 to 10 carbon atoms phenyl phenylalkyl preferably having 7 to 12 carbon atoms which may be substituted with dialkylamino preferably having a C1 to C3 alkyl group or phenylcarbonyl which may be substituted with alkoxycarbonyl preferably having 7 to 11 carbon atoms and ml m2 3 or 4 or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Examples of the phamaceutically acceptable salts are inorganic acid salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, nitrate, and phosphate and organic acid salts such as oxalate, succinate, malate, citrate, lactate, benzene sulfonate, toluene sulfonate, and methane sulfonate. In accordance with the present invention, there is also provided a proteinase inhibitor containing as an essential component the above mentioned L lysine derivatives or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Typical examples of the L lysine derivatives according to the present invention are summarized inTable I, wherein D indicated under the carbon atom of the compound Nos. 12, 15, and 22 denotes that the carbon atom is in the D form and Lys, Phe, and Pro in the formula of the compounds represent L lysine, phenylalanine, and proline, respectively. In the physical properties shown in Table I, NMR represents a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum indicated by 6 i.e., delta ppm representing the chemical shifts. The determination was carried out by using as a solvent CDC13 i.e., heavy chloroform , CD3 2SO i.e., d6 dimethylsulfoxide , or CD30D i.e., heavy methanol alone or in any mixture thereof and by using as an internal standard TMS i.e., tetramethylsilane . In the parenthesis after the 6 number, the number of the hydrogen atom and the symbols s, d, t, q, m, and broad thereafter means singlet, doublet, triplet, quartet, multiplet, and broad absorbance, respectively. The absorbance based on the solvent is deleted from theTable. IR represents an infrared absorption spectrum in which a potassium bromide tablet is used in the determination unless otherwise noted. When a solution is used in the determination, the kind of the solvent is listed in parenthesis. The number listed in the Table l represents a wave number in units of cm 1 and only the main absorption peaks are listed in the Table. MS represents a mass spectrum, and the results are shown as M e i.e., the mass of the cation fragment divided by the charge of the main peaks.

various combinations of the so called peptide synthesis methods. The synthesis routes can be typically divided into the following two routes. The terms N terminal and C terminal of lysine used herein mean as follows. CH2 4 N 2 1 1 2 1 N terminal NH 1 CH CO2 2 C terminal A The N terminal group of lysine is first introduced into the starting commercially available N6 CBZ i.e., H Lys OH wherein CBZ COOCH2 0 and the C termil group of lysine is then introduced thereinto, followed by removing the protective group CBZ. B The C terminal group of lysine is first introduced into the starting commercially availableN2 t butyloxycarbonyl N6 CBZ benzyloxycarbonyl L lysine i.e., BOC Lys OH whereinBOC COO C CH3 3 , the BOC group is then selectively removed therefrom in a known manner, and the N termina group of lysine is further introduced, followed by removing the CBZ group. Furthermore, in the practice of the introduction of the N terminal group and the C terminal group, the following methods can be utilized a The introduction of the N terminal groi can be introduced by using aromatic sulfonyl chloride i.e., ArSO2Cl or aromatic carbonyl chlorides i.e.,ArCOCl b The introduction of the C terminal group can be introduced by the following known methods i Mixed acid anhydride method Ann,Chem., 572, 190 1951 ii Acid chloride method Biochemistr . 4, 2219 1960 iii Phosphazo method Chem.

Soc., 85, 3039 1963 It should be noted, however, that the desired synthesis methods must be selected by appropriately combining the above mentioned methods. Typical routes for synthesizing the lysine derivatives are exemplified as follows. In the following routes, the amine portion represented byEMI47.1 may be substitued withHN Z W. Route Ol EMI47.2 N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide N hydroxysuccinimide EMI47.3 EMI48.1 The synthesis of the compound 2 from the compound 1 can be carried out by using the so called SchottenBaumann reaction. That is, the starting compound 1 is dissolved or suspended in a suitable solvent system e.g., ethyl ether water, toluene water, 1,4 dioxanewater, acetone water and a suitable base e.g., NaOH, NaHC03 , K2C03 is added in an amount of, for example, 1 to 5 equivalent, preferably 2 to 3 equivalent, to the compound 1 . To the resultant mixture, an aromatic sulfonyl or an aromatic carbonyl chloride i.e., ArS02Cl or ArCOCl is added alone or as a solution in an organic solvent used in the reaction medium.The addition may be carried out all at once or in several portions. The reaction is generally carried out at a temperature of 100C to 300C, preferably 50C to 100C for 1 to 50 hours, preferably 5 to 20 hours. The compound 2 can be recovered from the reaction mixture in any conventional manner. The synthesis of the compound 3 from the compound 2 can be carried out by the method b v set forth above. The compound 4 can be prepared from the compound 3 as follows. That is, the compound 3 is dissolved in a suitable organic solvent e.g., ethers, hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, N,N dialkylformamides, nitriles and a 1 to 3 equivalent amount ofEMI48.2 is added thereto. The reaction is generally carried out at a temperature of 100C to 300C, preferably OOC to 200C for 1 to 50 hours, preferably 5 to 20 hours.After completing the reaction, the compound 4 can be recovered in any conventional manner. The synthesis of the compound 5 from the compound 4 can be carried out by the so called HBr AcOH method see J. Am. Chem. Soc., 81, 5688 1959 or the so calledH2 Pd catalytic hydrogenation method see Chem. Ber., 65, 1192 1932 Route 02 EMI49.1 The compound 1 is dissolved in a suitable dried solvent e.g., ethers, halogenated hydrocarbons and, while the reaction temperature is maintained at 100C to 300C, preferably OOC to 50C, a 1.0 to 5.0 equivalent, preferably 1.0 to 1.5 equivalent, amount of phosphorus pentachloride is added all at once or over a period of 10 minutes to 1 hour, preferably 10 to 20 minutes, with stirring. After the addition, the reaction mixture is further stirred for 30 minutes to 1 hour while maintaining the above mentioned temperature range. Thereafter, the reaction mixture is allowed to stand with stirring at room temperature for 10 minutes to 2 hours, preferably for 10 minutes to 1 hour. The solvents and the other volatile substances are distilled off in vacuo at a temperature of 100C to 700C, preferably 300C to 500C. Thus, the compound 2 can be obtained. Since the compound 2 is unstable, the synthesis of the compound 3 from the compound 2 is preferably carried out immediately. That is, the compound 2 is dissolved in a suitable dried solvent e.g., ethers, halogenated hydrocarbons, hydrocarbons and a 1 to 3 equivalent amount ofEMI50.1 is added thereto. In this case, tertially organic amines such as triethylamine may be used. The reaction is generally carried out at a temperature of OOC to 50 C, preferably 10 C to 200C for 1 to 50 hours, preferably 5 to 20 hours.After completing the reaction, the compound 3 can be recovered in any conventional post treatment method. The synthesis of the compound 4 from the compound 3 can be carried out in the same manner as in the above mentioned route QI. Route 3EMI51.1 In the route z Q, the starting commercially available compound 1 is first dissolved in a suitable dried solvent e.g., ethyl acetate, 1,4 dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and a 1 to 5 equivalent amount, preferably a l to 2 equivalent amount, of a suitable tertially organic amine e.g., triethylamine is added thereto in an amount of 1 to 5 equivalent, preferably 1 to 2 equivalent, to the compound 1 . The resultant solution is cooled to a temperature of 200C to 100C, preferably 150C to OOC. Then, a 1 to 3 equivalent, preferably 1 to 1.5 equivalent amount of ethyl chlorocarbonate or phenyl chlorocarbonate is added to the cooled solution and the reaction is carried out for 5 minutes to one hour with stirring.After completing the reaction, a solution containing the compound 2 can be obtained in any conventional post treatment method. To the solution obtained above, a 1 to 3 equivalent ofEMI52.1 is added at a temperature of 150C to OOC. After the addition, the mixture is allowed to react at the same temperature for 10 minutes to 5 hours, and at a temperature of 5 C to 300C, preferably 10 C to 200C for 10 to 50 hours. After completing the reaction, the compound 3 can be recovered in any conventional post treatment method. The synthesis of the compound 4 from the compound 3 can be carried out by a known method as disclosed in, for example, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 58, 1806 1967 . The synthesis of the compound 5 from the compound 4 can be carried out either by using the so calledSchotten Baumann reaction set forth in the abovementioned route 0 or by using a suitable organic solvent e.g., ethers, N,N dialkylformamide, N,Ndialkylacetamide, halogenated hydrocarbons in combination with a suitable tertially organic base e.g., trialkylamines, dialkylanilines, pyridine . The synthesis of the compound 6 from the compound 1 can be carried out in the same manner as in the abovementioned route QI. Furthermore, in the case where the amino group is contained asa terminal group of the N terminal of lysine, the lysine derivative according to the present invention can be similarly prepkred in the following routes and 0 The L lysine derivatives obtained above can be converted to the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof in any conventional manner. RouteEMI53.1 wherein Q is a residue of the group A define above from which a group NH2 is removed.EMI53.2 EMI54.1 The L lysine derivatives or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof according to the present invention, which are an effective component of the proteinase inhibitor of the present invention have remarkable inhibition activities against proteinases such as plasmin, kallikrein, trypsin, and urokinase as shown in the below mentioned test results shown in Tables IV and V. It has not been reported that the low molecular weight compounds exhibiting no substantial inhibition activities against thrombin exhibit the above mentioned unique enzyme inhibition pattern. Furthermore, c aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid and other compounds, which are heretofore widely used as plasmin inhibitors, have an activity capable of selectively inhibiting the fibrin dissolving action of plasmin and, therefore, are used as useful hemostatics.This pharmacological action is believed to be effected by the fact that these compounds are bonded to the so called lysine binding sites i.e., LBS of plasminogen and plasmin, whereby the binding of fibrin to the plasminogen and plasmin is prevented as reported in, for example, Chem. Rev., 81, 431 1981 , Biochem. J., 163, 389 1977 , and Eur.J. Biochem., 84, 573 1978 . These compounds have no substantial activities to prevent the decomposition of synthetic substrates e.g., S 2251 available fromKabi Co., Ltd. and fibrinogen caused by plasmin.This means that, although various substrates e.g., fibrinogen , other than fibrin, are present in the human organisms for plasmin the above mentioned compounds are not effective for preventing the decomposition of these substrates. Contrary to the above, the proteinase inhibitors according to the present invention have remarkable inhibition activities against the decomposition of the synthetic substrates and fibrinogen as well as the decomposition of fibrin by plasmin and, therefore, are novel antiplasmins suitable for use as a hemostatic agent against hemorrhagic disorders and inflammatory disorders. On the other hand, known compound Nos. 4, 5, 7, and 8 listed in Table II having a structure similar to those of the present compounds has only a very low inhibition activity against the action of plasmin as shown in Table III. It is clear from the comparison of the results in Tables III and IV that the inhibition activities of the present compounds shown in Table IV are far superior to that of said compounds. Furthermore, as shown in Table V, some L lysine derivatives according to the present invention have inhibition activities against urokinase, which is a plasminogen activating enzyme. This means that the present L lysine derivatives provide favorable results as a hemostatic agent. In addition, someL lysine derivatives according to the present invention exhibit inhibition activities against kallikrein and trypsin. This means that these inhibition activities can provide, together with the antiplasmin activity, a strong anti inflammatory agent. When the L lysine derivatives or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are used as a medicine, there are no critical limitations to the administration methods. The present proteinase inhibitor can be formulated by any conventional method. For example, the present proteinase inhibitor may be applied in any conventional manner including intravenous injection, intramuscular injection, subcutaneous injection, intravenous drip, and oral administration.Although there are no critical limitations to the administration dosage, the suitable dosage is 100 to 1000 mg day person. EXAMPLES The present invention will now be further illustrated by, but is by no means limited to, the followingExamples illustrating the synthesis of the present compounds as well as the pharmacological test data for the evaluation thereof. Example 1 2 Synthesis of N p toluenesulfonyl L lysine 4 benzylpiperidinamide i.e., Compound No. 1 A 5 g amount of N6 benzyloxycarbonyl lysine I was dissolved in 100 ml of 1,4 dioxane, 150 ml of water, and 4.92 g of K2C03. A solution of 3.74 g of ptoluenesulfonyl chloride in 15 ml of 1,4 dioxane was dropwise added to the solution for 1.5 hours. The resultant mixture was allowed to stand with stirring for one night, while maintaining the temperature at 150C.Thereafter, the 1,4 dioxane and water were distilled off in vacuo. Water was charged to the residue and the resultant mixture was then washed with ethyl ether.

Then, 50 p1 of a 0.2 unit ml bovine thrombin solution is added thereto and the absorbance, at 405 nm, of the p nitroaniline formed per minute is determined at a temperature of 370C by using the so called initial velocity method.Thus, the concentration 150 of the inhibitor sample at which the absorbance is one half i.e., 1 2 of that obtained in the absence of the inhibitor sample, is determined. 3 Evaluation of Antitrypsin Activity Determination of inhibition activity against S 2238 decomposition An inhibitor sample is dissolved in a 0.05 M Tris imidazole buffer solution pH 8.1 and 125 p1 of a 1 mM S 2238 solution is added to make the total volume to 1.20 ml The mixture is incubated at a temperature of 370C for 5 minutes in a constant temperature bath. To this mixture, 0.05 ml of bovine trypsin is added and the absorbance, at 405 nm, of the p nitroaniline formed per minute is determined at a temperature of 370C by using the so called initial velocity method. Thus, the concentration I50 of the inhibitor sample, at which the absorbance is one half i.e., 1 2 of that obtained in the absence of the inhibitor sample, is determined. 4 Evaluation of Anti Plasma Kallikrein Activity Determination of prevention activity for S 2302 decomposition An inhibitor sample is dissolved in a 0.05 M Tris hydrochloric acid buffer solution pH 7.8 to make the total volume to 400 p1. To this solution, 50 p1 of a 2 mM S 2302 solution is added and the mixture is incubated at a temperature of 370C for 5 minutes in a constant temperature bath. Then, 50 p1 of a 0.12 unit ml human plasma kallikrein is added and the mixture is incubated at a temperature of 370C for 5 minutes.Thereafter, 50 p1 of 50 acetic acid is added to terminate the reaction. The absorbance of the pnitroaniline formed in the reaction mixture is measured at 405 nm. Thus, the concentration ISo of the inhibitor sample, at which the absorbance is one half i.e., 1 2 of that obtained in the absence of the inhibitor sample, is determined. 5 Evaluation of Antiurokinase Activity Determination of prevention activity for S 2444 decomposition An inhibitor sample is dissolved in a 0.05 M Tris hydrochloric acid buffer solution pH 8.8 to make the total volume to 400 p1. To this solution, 50 p1 of a 1 mM S 2444 solution is added and the mixture is incubated at a temperature of 370C for 5 minutes in a constant temperature bath. Then, 50 p1 of a 500 unit ml human urokinase is added and the mixture is incubated at a temperature of 370C for 5 minutes. Thereafter, 50 p1 of 50 acetic acid is added to terminate the reaction.The absorbance of the p nitroaniline formed in the reaction mixture is measured at 405 nm. Thus, the concentration I50 of the inhibitor sample, at which the absorbance is one half i.e., 1 2 of that obtained in the absence of the inhibitor sample, is determined.
