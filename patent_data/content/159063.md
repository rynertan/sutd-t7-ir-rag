# PRESS APPARATUS FOR CHARGING A FLOWABLE MATERIAL INTO A HONEYCOMB STRUCTURE

## Abstract
A press 70 is described for charging a flowable material, e.g. a cement, into a honeycomb structure 21 having a plurality of cells open at an end face thereof, e.g. for filtering solid particulates. The press comprises a press head 75 having a chamber 84 which is open at an outer surface of the press head to accept the honeycomb structure 21 for charging, and further having a bore extending away from the chamber 84 opposite said opening. Means such as a pneumatically inflated collar 85 are provided for securing the end face of the honeycomb structure 21 across the opening, and means 82 are provided for injecting the flowable material through the press head 75 into the chamber 84 . A piston 83 is slidably mounted in the bore for pressing the flowable material in the chamber 84 into the end face of the structure 21 and a flexible diaphragm 89 is affixed at its outer edges to the press head 75 and at its centre to the piston 83
