# Penile prosthesis of improved malleable construction.

## Abstract
An implantable penile prosthesis for overcoming male erectile impotence in the form of an elongated cylindrical device of malleable construction. The device is adapted to be implanted within the corpora cavernosa of the penis. A malleable rod capable of holding any shape to which it is bent is encapsulated within a cylindrical insert member made of biocompatible, flexible maerial. A thin walled sleeve of predetermined wall thickness may be positioned over the outside of the cylindrical insert member in covering relation thereto for adjustment of the outside diameter of the implant device. The cylindrical insert member tapers along its distal end section towards the distal end extremity of the device.
