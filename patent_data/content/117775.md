# Integral engine air cooling system.

## Abstract
A cooling system 10 for use with an engine 12 and an associated engine driven flywheel 16 . The system includes centrifugal blower means 30 fitted to and rotatable with the flywheel for developing a pressure differential thereacross a housing 32 enclosing said flywheel and said blower means for defining an air passage 34 having a housing inlet 36 for com municating air to said blower means and an output 40 for per mitting the discharge of air therethrough air cooled heat ex change means 50 connected to and postioned relative to the housing to permit air to flow therethrough by virtue of the operation of the blower means damper means responsive to at least one engine operating parameter, for controlling the air flow through the heat exchange means and compartment means 20 for enclosing the blower means and housing and oriented to prohibit the entrance of ram air thereto and in cluding inlet means 42, 42 for receiving non ram air. Air conditioning condensers 70, 80 are positioned in communi cation with the compartment means 20 and inlet means and cooled by the induced air provided by the operation of the blower means.
