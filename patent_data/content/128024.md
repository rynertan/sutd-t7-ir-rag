# POLARIZATION RETAINING SINGLE MODE OPTICAL WAVEGUIDE

## Abstract
An optical fiber is disclosed for operating single polariza tion, single mode at wavelength λ. The fiber core 15, 21 is surrounded by cladding having the refractive index lower than the average refractive index of the core. The core is characterized in that it comprises a plurality of transparent laminae 16, 17, 23, 24, 31, 32, 37, 38 , each having a refractive index different from that of the adjacent laminae. The thick ness of each lamina is equal to or less than wavelength λ.
