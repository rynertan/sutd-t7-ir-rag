# APPARATUS FOR EXAMINING AN OBJECT BY USING ULTRASONIC BEAMS

## Abstract
In an ultrasonic examination apparatus 100 of the sector scanning type, a false contour appears in a tomographic image of an object 20 due to a variation of the pixelizing, or digitizing precision over the entire scanning region, especially near the central ultrasonic scanning lines. A wobbling proces sor 64 is provided in an address generator for write opera tion 6 . When the echo signals, or the image signals obtained by the scanning of the central untrasonic scanning lines are written into pixels of a frame memory, the write in addresses are processed by the wobbling processor 64 so that the pixelizing precision can be uniformed over the entire scan ning region.
