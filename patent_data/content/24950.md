# Weighing and dispensing unit.

## Abstract
Food is fed onto a weighing platform 32 inside a dis pensing chamber 31 and carried by a parallelogram weigh ing support 56 disposed outside the dispensing chamber and supported by means of four parallelogram arms 54, 55 from an upright frame 40 , the platform being retained in a position to receive the food by a releasable latch 98, 99 . When a weight beam 101 detects a weight set by a control circuit 18 , it sends a signal to the control circuit which causes feed to stop and provides a condition in which a signal can be sent to the latch 98, 99 to release the weighing platform 32 into a position in which a weighed portion of food can be discharged therefrom. In one embodiment, at least one switch 16a, 17a is manually operated from outside the unit to cause the control circuit 18 to apply the releasing signal to the latch 98, 99 either immediately or after an interval of time
