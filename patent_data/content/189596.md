I . Test Method Experiments with rats and mice were carried out according to Assay Programs num 27 104 and 27 106, respectively. The outline is as follows. 1. Bioassay for Diuretic Effect on Rats Slc SD 8 week old rats male, about 2SOg body weight each wera used for the test. A few lumps of sugar in place of ordinary diets were given on the morning of the day before the test day and 5 glucose solution was given orally at a rate of 20 ml kg in the evening approximately at 4 p.m. of the test day. In the morning for the test, a sample which was prepared by suspending or dissolving a test compound in 2Z gum arabic was orally administered to each at a dose of 20 ml kg. On the other hand, mere by 2 gum arabic was orally administered to the control group at 20 ml kg. Immediately after the administration, the test animals were put in a piastic cage for the metabolic tests and their urine samples were collected for 5 hours. The cumulative urine volume, urinary sodium Na , and urinary potassium K were quantitatively determined. 2. Bioassay for Diuretic Effect on Mice Slc cldy 5 week old mice female, about 20g body weight each were used for the test. From the morning of the day before the test day, the mice were fasted but water. In the morning of the test day, a sample which was prepared by suspending or dissolving a test compound in 2X ,gum arabic was orally administered to each at 0 ml kg. On the other hand, mere by 2 gum arabic was orally administered to the control group at 30 ml kg. Immediately after the administration, 5 mice employed were put in a plastic cage for the metabolic tests and their urine samples were collected for 4 hours. The cumulative urine volume, urinary sodium Na , and urinary potassium K were quantitatively determined. R. Test Results Results on some typical compounds are shown in Table 10.
