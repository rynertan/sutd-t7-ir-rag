## Description
TITLE COMPOSITE OF RUBBER AND METAL REINFORCEMENT THEREFORField of Invention This invention relates to the adhesion of metal to elastomers. The invention particularly relates to a composite of rubber and wire filament or cabled wire filaments in the form of a cord as reinforcement therefor.The invention further relates to a composite of sulfur cured rubber and tire cord, composed of at least one metallic plated steel filament as a reinforcement therefore, and particularly to a pneumatic or semi penumatic rubber tire containing such reinforcement. The invention additionally relates to rubber industrial power transmission belts, conveyor belts and to rubber hose contain ing such reinforcement.Background of the Invention Adhesion of rubber to metal has for along time been the subject of considerable experimentation and research.Various solutions have been suggested and have provided various degrees of success. For example, various physical configurations of cabled wire filaments have been used to enhance physical or mechanical adhesion to rubber. Also, the surface of wire filaments has been treated by various materials and methods to enhance adhesion to rubber. Further, various meterials have been mixed with the rubber itself in an effort to increase its adhesion to a cord of cabled wire filaments. Such rubber metal reinforced composites are often applicable to the construction of pneumatic tires, industrial belts and hose. However, even with the extensive amount of work and suggeste d solutions, methods of enhancing adhesion of rubber to metal are still being sought.Disclosure and Practice of the Invention In accordance with this invention, a composite of sulfur vulcanized rubber composition containing zinc oxide, carbon black, optionally and or mineral fillers such as clay and or .predipitated silica, cure accelerators, fatty acid and or ester thereof such as stearic acid or zinc stearate and metal reinforcement therefor is provided where said metal reinforcement is at least one cord of at least one metallic plated steel wire filament adhered to said rubber at least in part through sulfur vulcanization, characterized in that said rubber composition contains A from about 0.05 to about 3, preferably about 0.2 to about 0.8 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of rubber phr of at least one cobalt compound selected from at least one of cobaltous hydroxide, cobaltous oxide, cobaltic oxide and cobalt carbonate and B about 0.2 to about 8, preferably about 0.5 to about 3 phr of at least one compound co active with said cobalt compound selected from 1 monocarboxylic acids, 2 dicarboxylic acids, 3 polycarboxylic acids other than dicarboxylic acids, 4 mono and or dihydroxyl substituted alkyl benzene or benzene and 5 organic chelating agents wherein the weight ratio of said cobalt compound to said co active compound or material is in the range of about 1 6 to about 1 1. Preferably, about a stbichiometric amount of the coactive compound is used, based on its reaction with said cobalt compound although a more or less amount can be used. In further accordance with this invention, such a composite is provided of the sulfur vulcanized rubber composition and, containing therein as reinforcement therefor, at least one metal filament, optionally as a multiple of filaments cabled together as a cord, said metal filament composed of a steel filament having a microscopically thin metallic coating thereon comprised primarily of brass and or zinc. It is to be appreciated that such metallic coated steel filament can optionally also havea thin overcoat thereon of protective compound such as, for example, benzotriazole or similarly protective compound. In further accordance with this invention, a pneumatic and or semi pne.umatic rubber tire is provided typically having a generally toroidal shape and comprised of a general construction containing a tread, spaced inextensible beads and sidewalls connecting said beads and tread and with a supporting carcass therefor, where said carcass is a metal filament reinforced sulfur cured rubber composste of this invention. In addition, in accordance with thins invention an industrial article of manufacture is provided selected from at least one of industrial conveyor belt, power transmission belt and hose which are, at least in part, constructed of the metal filament reinforced sulfur vulcanized rubber composite of this invention. It is understood that other conventiaial materials can be used in the compounding of the rubber which include antidegradants, tackifying resins of the non reactive type, peptizers, fillers and or pigments and processing oils. Although it is related herein that the various mineral fillers can be used, usually the carbon black is preferred. For the compounding of the rubber and the preparation of the wire rubber composite, the compounding materials are simply mixed together to form the compounded rubber and applied to the filament or cord thereof, usually in a form of a textile type fabric form, such as by calendering and the resulting composite built into a green tire, industrial belt or hose construction and the product simplymolded and cured with the aid of pressure to form the article of manufacture. Generally, the rubber metal composite is cured at a temperature in the range of about 500 C. to about 2000 C. Various rubbers can be used in the practice of this invention of which unsaturated types are preferred.Representative of such unsaturated rubbers are for example, natural rubber, synthetic cis 1,4 polyisoprene, trans 1,4 polyisoprene, cyclene rubbers, rubbery polymers of 1,3 polybutadiene, butadiene styrane copolymers, isoprene styrene copolymers, isoprene methylstyrene copolymers, butadiene acrylonitrile copolymers, EPDM rubbers, butyl rubbers,halobutyl rubbers, norbornene rubbers, thiokol rubbers and blends thereof. The wire cord itself in the practice of this. invention can be composed of 1 to 50 or more filaments of steel wire twisted, or cabled together to form the cord.Therefore, the cord can be monofilament in nature although this is considered rare and at least four filaments are usually preferred. For example, for use in pneumatic rubber tires, cord for passenger tires might be composed of 3 to 6 cabled filaments, cord for truck tires 10 to 30 cabled filaments and cord for giant earthmover vehicle tires 40 to 50 cabled filaments. It is generally preferred that the steel filaments themselves are individually coated, or plated, with transition metal or alloy thereof which are preferably microporous, often practically monomolecular representative of which are at least one of those selected from braszirconium, cerium, lanthanum, nickel, cobalt, tin, titanium, zinc, copper and bronze. Generally, an outer monomolecular, microporous layer of zinc suitable over a very thin brass plate on the steel wire. It is recognized that the steel wire can be plated or coated with the metal or metal alloy such as brass and or transition metal or alloy by various methods to obtain a thin, preferably a practically monomolecular coat and usually somewhat microporous in nature. For, electro deposition can be used by passing the wire through a charged electrolyte bath. It may also be feasible to use a vapor deposition technique to plate the wire. The metal coating on the steel is generally microscopically porous thereby perhaps exposing small areas of steel surface. It is not reasonably practical to describe within rigid limits the metal plating on the steel wire. Optimum thicknesses and amounts can be a function of variables such as nature of the brass, zinc, or brass zinc or metal alloy surface, mode of deposition, thickness of initial oxide layers, magnitude of residual stresses, copper content, brass thickness, as well as the reactivity of the rubber vulcani2ation system. The steel wire can relate generally to what is known as carbon steel, also called ordinary steel, also called straight carbon steel or plain carbon steel, e.g.,American Iron and Steel Institute Grade 1070 high carbon steel AISI 1070 . Such steel owes its properties chiefly to the presence of carbon without substantial amounts of other alloylng elements. In this respect see Metals HandbooR, The American Society for Metals, Metals Park, Brass generally and preferably relates to compositions in which the major component is alpha brass, i.e., which contain from about 62 to 75 percent copper and 38 to 25 percent zinc, respectively. The cobalt compound and co active compound can be mixed with the rubber and its compounding ingredients by conventional procedures prior to application to the metal filament wire . As hereinbefore pointed out, the plated wire may contain a coating of protective material such as benzotriazole and the like prior to application of the compounded rubber.Such protective agent coatings are those which are believed to somewhat interact with copper in a brass coating on the steel wire to form a polymeric complex of agent plus copper and or zinc. This polymeric complex is insoluble in most solvents and serves as a protective barrier to environmental degradation of the underlying brass. The practice of the present invention has been observed to result in improved aged rubber metal adhesion, in many cases with improved initial, i.e., original adhesion of vulcanized brass coated steel rubber composites. Of the co active compound for use with the cobalt compound, various mono , di and poly carboxylic acids can be used, such as those having 1 to 40, preferably 3 to 40 carbon atoms and various hydroxyl substituted benzenes and organic chelating agents can be used whidh are preferably rubber soluble and which can complex with the said cobalt compound. The monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids are the preferred co active compounds. Representative of the various monocarboxylic acids are propionic, butyric, hexanoic, octanoic, undecylenic, decanoic, stearic, linolenic, oleic, behenic, naphthenic, abietic, dehydroabietic, pimaric, isostearic and hydroxy stearic acids. The undecylenic, stearic, oleic, and abietic acids are preferred. Representative of the various dicarboxylic acids are azelaic, sebacic, suberic, succinic, maleic, adipic and phthalic acids. Anhydrides of maleic and phthalic acids are to be included. The azelaic, nialeic and adipic acids are preferred dicarboxylic acids. Dimer and trimer acids polycarboxylic acids can also be suitable. The dimer or trimer acids can be acyclic or cyclic C8 C50 and can contain two or more carboxyl groups. Examples of such polycarboxylic acids might be selected from those identified as Empol dimer and trimer acids from the Emery Industries company and as Hystrene dimer and trimer acids from the Humko Products company. Representative of various hydroxyl substituted benzenes are nonyl, phenol, octyl phenol, hexyl phenyl, decyl phenol, catechol and resorcinol. The nonyl, octyl, hexyl and decyl phenols are generally preferred if a hydroxyl substituted benzene is used. Representative of the various organic chelating agents are ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid and oxalyl bis benzylidene hydrazide, oxamide, N hydroxyethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, N,N disalicylidene l 2 propane diaminevcitric acid, tartEriD acid, iminodiacetic acid, lauroyl iminodiacetic acid and oleoyl iminodiacetic acid. The practice of this invention is further illustrated by reference to the following examples which are intended to be representative rather than restrictive of the scope of the invention. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are by weight.

The brass coated steel wire cords had been positioned in a parallel matrix somewhat in the form of a textile type fabric. After curing the composite of rubber compound and wire cord at a temperature in the range of about 850 C. to about 1500C. for about 20 to 90 minutes, individual samples were tested for adhesion. The samples were then later tested for aged adhesion after 10 or 15 days exposure to water at 900C. The results of both the adhesion and aged adhesion tests are shown in the following Tables 3 A and 3 B, wherein experiments or examples A F correspond to the compounds A F of Table 2.
