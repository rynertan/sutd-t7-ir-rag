## Description
SPECIFICATION ASCORBIC ACID DERIVATIVES TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to ascorbic acid derivatives of the formula I ,EMI1.1 wherein R1 R2 R3 and R4 each is hydrogen or pivaloyl, R but R , R2, R and R4 are not hydrogen at the same time, and salts thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Ascorbic acid is contained in lens and aqueous humor in higher concentration than in other tissues the usual level in lens 20 to 30 mg . The lenticular ascorbic acid as well as glutathion is considered to contribute to oxidation reduction system in lens and functionally to maintain the lens transparency.The decrement of ascorbic acid in cataractous lens have been observed by many investigators. From the above fact, ascorbic acid instilled to the eyes or given orally is thought to be useful to prevent the cataracts formation. But the solubility of ascorbic acid in lipoid is very small, so its practical use for therapeutics is limited. Although number of esters of ascorbic acid, for example acetylascorbic acid, benzoylascorbic acid, palmitoylascorbic acid, etc. are know, the utility of these compounds for medical drug is limited because of their low solubility in lipoid and low membrane permeability. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Ascorbic acid is useful for cataracts, but the solubility in lipoid is very small, so its practical use for therapeutics is difficalt.We succeeded to improve the stability, solubility in lipoid, membrane permeability, etc. of ascorbic acid by the conversion to pivalate, and thus we found that the compounds of this invention are useful as therapeutic agents for cataracts.EMI2.1 wherein R1 R2 R3 and R4 each is hydrogen or pivaloyl, but R1, R2, R3 and R4 are not hydrogen at the same time. Compounds of the formula I of this invention can be prepared, for example, by the following methods, A , B and C ,A the reaction of L ascorbic acid with active derivatives of pivalic acid, for example pivaloyl chloride B the reaction of L ascorbic acid protected by the suitable groups, for example isopropylidene group, with active derivatives of pivalic acid andC the rearrangement of 2,6 O,O dipivaloyl L ascorbic acid to 3,6 dipivaloyl L ascorbic acid.
