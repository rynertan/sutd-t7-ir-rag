# Cold damping of mechanical structures.

## Abstract
Apparatus for substantially reducing the effect of the inherent transducer capacitance in a transducer coupled electromechanical system which is subject to vibrational movement. First and second electromechanical transduc ers 36, 38 , mechanically coupled to the mechanical struc ture are interconnected by an electronic feedback network 30 . The feedback network 30 is characterized by very low input and output impedances thus overcoming the shunting effects of the inherent transducer capacitance C₁,C₀ . In preferred embodiments the feedback network is electronically cooled 31, R1 R2, R3 thereby provid ing low noise damping.
