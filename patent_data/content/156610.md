# Ink transfer thermal printer.

## Abstract
In an ink transfer thermal printer the mechanism for switching from a thermal head 4 head down state in which printing takes place with contact between the thermal head 4 , a thermo ink ribbon 1 and paper 7 to a head up state in which printing does not take place, with no such contact utilizes a cam 24,124 and a cam follower 25,125 . The printer has a winding up mechanism operating a take up reel 2 for an ink transfer ribbon 1 . Wind up or take up of the ribbon 1 is effected or not effected in accordance with the state head down or head up of the thermal head 4 , so that feeding of the ink transfer ribbon during a spacing operation the head up state is prevented, thereby to economise on use of the ink transfer ribbon. The cam action employed re duces noise caused by the switching action. The mass of moving parts associated with the switching operation is small, so that a high switching speed can be achieved.
