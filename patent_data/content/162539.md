# Brake device, particularly for a robot arm.

## Abstract
A brake device for use in an arm of a robot or manipulator comprises a brake drum 15 , a lever 18 pivotally supported at its intermediate portion 19 , a brake shoe 17 provided on the lever between its pivotally supported point and its one end, a pneumatic actuator A axially contractible upon ap plying internal pressure thereinto and having a movable end connected to the one end or the other end of the lever, and a spring 23 connected to the end of the lever not connected to the actuator so as to operate to elongate the actuator. This brake device is small sized and of light weight and consumes only a small amount of fluid pressure. The brake device according to the invention is applicable to a robot arm comprising a rotatable member 41 connected to the brake drum so as to rotate therewith, and two elastic actuators 38 the one ends of which are connected to a sta tionary member and the other ends of which are connected to each other through the rotatable member so as to rotate the rotatable member by contraction of the one actuator and simultaneous extension of the other actuator. At least one of the actuators is a pneumatic actuator axially contractible upon applying internal pressure thereinto.
