## Description
PHOSPHOR AND RADIATION IMAGE STORAGE PANEL EMPLOYING THE SAME BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a phosphor and a radiation image storage panel employing the same, and more particularly, to a divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor containing a small amount of scandium and a radiation image storage panel employing the same.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Recently, it has been found that a divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor BaFX Eu 2 , in which X is at least one halogen selected from the group consisting of C, Br and I absorbs and stores a portion of radiation energy when exposed to a radiation such asX rays, and emits light in the near ultraviolet to blue region when excited with an electromagnetic wave within a wavelength region of 450 900 nm after exposure to the radiation, that is, the phosphor shows stimulated emission the peak wavelength of the stimulated emission is within the region of approx. 385 405 nm, depending upon the kind of halogen which is a component of the phosphor .In particular, the divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor has been paid much attention and investigated as a stimulable phosphor employable for a radiation image storage panel i.e., stimulable phosphor sheet which is used in a radiation image recording and reproducing method utilizing the stimulability thereof. A radiation image storage panel has a basic struc ture comprising a support and at least one phosphor layer provided on one surface of the support which comprises a binder and a stimulable phosphor dispersed therein. Further, a transparent protective film is generally provided on the free surface surface not facing the support of the phosphor layer to keep the phosphor layer from chemical deterioration or physical shock. The radiation image recording and reproducing method using the above described radiation image storage panel comprising the stimulable phosphor is a very advantageous method replacing the conventional radiography. As described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,239,968, the method involves steps of causing the stimulable phosphor of the panel to absorb radiation energy having passed through an object or having radiated from an object exciting the stimulable phosphor with an electromagnetic wave such as visible light and infrared rays hereinafter referred to as stimulating rays to sequentially release the radiation energy stored in the stimulable phosphor as light emission stimulated emission photoelectrically detecting reading out the emitted light to obtain electric signals and reproducing a visible image from the electric signals on a recording material such as a photosensitive film or on a display device such as CRT. In the radiation image recording and reproducing method, a radiation image can be obtained with a sufficient amount of information by applying a radiation to the object at considerably smaller dose, as compared with the case of using the conventional radiography. Accordingly, this radiation image recording and reproducing method is of great value especially when the method is used for medical diagnosis. The operation of reading out the radiation energy stored in the radiation image storage panel in the abovedescribed method is generally carried out by the steps of scanning the panel with a laser beam stimulating rays to sequentially excite the stimulable phosphor so as to release the radiation energy stored therein as light emission and detecting the light by a photosensor such as a photomultiplier. In the last step of the read out operation, the light which is continuously emitted by the stimulable phosphor of the radiation image storage panel after terminating the excitation with stimulating rays namely, afterglow of stimulated emission causes the decrease ofS N ratio of the resulting image. More in detail, the afterglow given by the phosphor particles other than the phosphor particles aimed to excite is detected as the light emitted by the aimed ones in the case that the phosphor gives afterglow in a relatively high ratio to the amount of the stimulated emission. As a result, the image provided by the radiation image storage panel comprising such a stimWulable phosphor tends to be deteriorated on the image quality sharpness, density resolution, etc. . The afterglow characteristics of the panel varies depending not only on the employed stimulable phosphor but also on the intensity of stimulating rays, the scanning speed in the case of using a laser beam as the stimulating rays, or the like. In practical use, the influence of afterglow on the image quality further varies depending upon the detecting procedure of stimulated emission. Nevertheless, it is of great value to improve the afterglow characteristics of the panel which give an adverse effect to the image quality, even if the improvement is not so high. As described in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 59 1984 56479, the above mentioned divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor is improved in the luminance of stimulated emission by incorporating a specific amount of sodium halide thereinto. More in detail, the divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor containing sodium halide and having the formula BaFX aNaX xEu 2 in which each of X and X is at least one halogen selected from the group consisting of C, Br and I and a and x are numbers satisfying the conditions of O a 2.0 andO x 0.2, respectively, gives stimulated emission of higher luminance than the divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor containing no sodium halide. However, the incorporation of sodium halide into the divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor tends to deteriorate the afterglow characteristics of stimulated emission thereof.The divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor containing sodium halide with the above formula is desired to be improved in the afterglow characteristics. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor containing sodium halide which is improved in the afterglow given after termination of the excitation with stimulating rays. It is another object of the present invention to provide a radiation image storage panel employing said phosphor which is improved in the quality of the image provided thereby. The present inventors have studied on the divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor containing sodium halide, and as a result, they ahve found that the afterglow characteristics of the phosphor which further contains scandium within a specific amount range can be remarkably improved, to accomplish the invention. The phosphor of the present invention is a divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor containing the specific amount of sodium halide and scandium and having the formula I BaFXeaNaX xEu2 ,ySc I ,ySc in which each of X and X is at least one halogen selected from the group consisting of C, Br and I and a, x and y are numbers satisfying the conditions of O a 2.0, 0 x 0.2 and 10 3 3 y 10 1, respectively. The radiation image storage panel of the present invention comprises a support and a stimulable phosphor layer provided thereon, in which the stimulable phosphor layer contains the divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor having the above formula I . More in detail, the invention is accomplished on the finding that the divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor having the above formula I has the prominently improved afterglow characteristics particularly in a period of approx. 10 3 10 2 sec. after excitation with stimulating rays. Accordingly, an image of high quality can be stably obtained in the radiation image recording and reproducing method by using the radiation image storage panel of the present invention employing the above mentioned divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 graphically shows the afterglow characteristics of a radiation image storage panel containing BaFEr 0.0023NaBr O.OOlEu2 ,0.005Sc phosphor according to the present invention dotted curve , and of a radiation image storage panel for comparison containing BaFBr 0.0023NaBr 0.001Eu2 phosphor solid curve . Fig. 2 graphically shows a relationship between an amount of scandium y value and a relative amount of afterglow with respect to the radiation image storage panel containing BaFBr0.0023NaBr 0.001Eu2 ,ySc phosphor. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor of the present invention has the formula I BaFX aNaX xEu2 ,ySc I in which each of X and X is at least one halogen selected from the group consisting of Cl, Br and I and a, x and y are numbers satisfying the conditions of O a 2.0, 0 x 0.2 and 10 3 y 10 1, respectively. The phosphor of the invention having the above formula I gives stimulated emission when excited with an electromagnetic wave having a wavelength within the region of 450 900 nm after exposure to a radiation such as X rays. From the viewpoint of the luminance of the stimulated emission and the afterglow characteristics thereof, the number for y in the formula I which indicates the amount of scandium is preferably within the range of 10 3 y 10 2. From the viewpoint of the luminance of stimulated emission, NaX indicating sodium halide is preferably NaBr, and the number for a indicating the amount of sodium halide is preferably within the range of 10 5 a 5x10 1 and more preferably 5x10 4 a 10 2 From the viewpoint of the luminance of stimulated emission, X indicating halogen is preferably at least one element selected from the group consisting of Br and I.As described hereinbefore, the stimulation spectrum of the phosphor of the invention is shown in the wavelength region of 450 900 nm, and the peak wavelength thereof shifts toward the longer wavelength side in such an order of halogen X as C, Br and I depending upon the halogenX. Accordingly, further from the viewpoint of matching with a source of stimulating rays such as a He Ne laser 633 nm and a semiconductorlaser infrared rays which are now proposed to employ in practical use, X in the formula I is preferably Br and or I. From the viewpoint of both the luminance of stimulated emission and afterglow characteristics, the number for x in the formula I which indicates the amount of europium activator is preferably within the range of 10 5 x 10 2. A radiation image storage panel having a phosphor layer which comprises BaFBr 0.0023NaBr O.OOlEu2 ,ySc phosphor an example of the phosphor of the present invention dispersed in a binder has a relationship between y value indicating an amount of scandium and an amount of afterglow as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 graphically shows a relationship between y value and a relative amount of afterglow logarithmic value of amount of afterglow amount of stimulated emission measurea at 2x10 3 sec. after scanning with stimulating rays. As is evident from Fig. 2, the radiation image storage panel containing the BaFBr 0.0023NaBr O.OOlEu2 ,ySc phosphor is hardly improved in the afterglow characteristics when the amcunt of scandium y value is less than 10 3. It has been confirmed that the sensitivity of the panel i.e., the luminance of stimulated emission of the phosphor is extremely lowered when the y value exceeds 10 1, though the afterglow characteristics are improved that is, the relative amount of afterglow is reduced . It has been further confirmed that radiation image storage panels employing other divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphors having the formula I than the above mentioned one have the same tendencies on the afterglow characteristics and sensitivity as described above. The amount of scandium y value contained in the phosphor is preferred to be small from the viewpoint of absorption efficiency of the resulting phosphor to a radiation such as X rays and hygroscopic property thereof.Considering these facts, the y value range for the phos phor of the invention is decided as 10 3 y 1, and preferably as 10 3 y 10 2. The divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor of the present invention basically has the above mentioned formula I , and other various components may be further incorporated into the phosphor in the preparation thereof, so far as they do not reduce the effect based on the incorporation of Sc i.e., the improvement of afterglow characteristics . Phosphors containing such additive components are include in the phosphor of the invention. Examples of the additive component include the following substances metal oxides as described in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 55 1980 160078 tetrafluoroboric acid compounds as described in U.S. Patent Application No. 520,215 hexafluoro compounds as described in U.S. PatentApplication No. 502,648 alkali metal halides MIX , in which MI is at least one alkali metal selected from the group consisting ofLi, K, Rb and Cs and X is at least one halogen selected from the group consisting of F, Cl, Br and I , divalent metal halides M11x 2, in which M11 is at least one divalent metal selected from the group consisting of Be and Mg and X is at least one halogen selected from the group consiting of F, C, Br and I and trivalent metal halides M111X in which MIII is at least one trivalent metal selected from the group consisting of Ae, Ga,In and Tl and X is at least one halogen selected from the group consiting of F, C, Br and I , as described inU.S. Patent Application No. 543,326 zirconium as described in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 56 1981 116777 boron as described in Japanese Patent ProvisionalPublication No. 57 1982 23673 arsenic and silicon as described in Japanese PatentProvisional Publication No. 57 1982 23675 and transition metals as described in U.S. Patent Application No. 535,928. The incorporation of metal oxides as described in the above mentioned Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 55 1980 160078 is particularly effective to prevent the sintering of a phosphor in the firing stage of the preparation thereof and to enhance the luminance of stimulated emission of the phosphor and the flowability thereof. The metal oxide is generally incoporated in an amount of 5x105 0.5 mol per 1 mol of BaFX, prefera bly 10 5 0.3 mol, and more preferably 10 4 0.2 mol. The preferred metal oxide are SiO2 and AQ203. The divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor of the present invention having the formula I can be prepared, for instance, by a process described below. As the starting materials, the following materials 1 to 4 can be employed 1 barium fluoride 2 barium halide except barium fluoride 3 scandium compound 4 sodium halide except sodium fluoride and 5 at least one compound selected from the group consisting of europium compounds such as europium halide, europium oxide, europium nitrate and europium sulfate.Further, ammonium halide may be employed as a flux. The above scandium compound 3 is preferably a scandium halide. In the first place, the above mentioned starting materials 1 to 5 are mixed in the stoichiometric ratio corresponding to the formula II BaFX aNaX xEu,ySc Il in which X, X , a, x and y have the same meanings as defined hereinbefore. The mixing procedure is conducted, for instance, by mixing the starting materials in the form of a suspension. From the suspension of the starting material mixture, the solvent e.g., water is removed to obtain a dry mixture in a solid form. The removal of solvent is preferably conducted at room temperature or not so high temperature for instance, not higher than 2000C by drying under reduced pressure and or vacuum. The mixing procedure is by no means restricted to this one. As a modification, there may be employed a procedure of mixing the starting materials 1 , 2 and 5 in the form of a suspension, drying the suspension, and then adding the scandium compound 3 and sodium halide 4 to the dry mixture. In the second place, the obtained dry mixture is finely pulverized, and the pulverized mixture is then placed in a heat resistant container such as a quartz boat or an alumina crucible and fired in an electric furnace. The temperature for the firing suitably ranges from 500 to 13000C. The firing period is determined depending upon the amount of the mixture of starting materials, the firing temperature, etc., and suitably ranges from 0.5 to 6 hours. As the firing atmosphere, there can be employed a weak reducing atmosphere such as a nitrogen gas atmosphere containing a small amount of hydrogen gas or a carbon dioxide gas atmosphere containing carbon monoxide gas. When the employed europium compound contains trivalent europium, the trivalent europium is reduced to divalent europium under the weak reducing atmosphere in the firing stage. After firing the mixture of starting materials for the phosphor as described above, the fired product is taken out of the electric furnace, allowed to stand for cooling and pulverized. The pulverized product may be further fired second firing . The second firing is conducted at a temperature of 500 800 C for 0.5 12 hours in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen gas atmosphere or an argon gas atmosphere, or in the above mentioned weak reducing atmosphere. After the firing is complete, a powdery phosphor is obtained. The obtained phosphor may be processed in a conventional manner involving a variety of procedures for the preparation of phosphors such as a washing procedure, a drying procedure and a sieving procedure, if desired. In the case that the phosphor of the present invention contains such additive components as described above, the additive components are incorporated into the suspension in the mixing procedure of the starting materials for the phosphor or into the dry mixture prior to the firing stage. The above described process gives the aforementioned divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor having the formula I . The radiation image storage panel of the present invention will be described hereinafter. The radiation image storage panel basically comprises a support and a phosphor layer provided thereon, comprises a binder and a stimulable phosphor dispersed therein. The phosphor layer can be formed on the support, for instance, by the following procedure. In the first place, particles of the stimulable phosphor having the formula I and a binder are added to an appropriate solvent, and then they are mixed to prepare a coating dispersion which comprises the phosphor particles homogeneously dispersed in the binder solution. Examples of the binder to be contained in the phosphor layer include natural polymers such as proteins e.g. gelatin , polysaccharides e.g. dextran and gum arabic and synthetic polymers such as polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl acetate, nitrocellulose, ethylcellulose, vinyl idene chloride vinylchloride copolymer, polymethyl methacrylate, vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer, polyurethane, cellulose acetate butyrate, polyvinyl alcohol, and linear polyester. Among these binders, particularly preferred are nitrocellulose, linear polyester, polyalkyl meth acrylate, a mixture of nitrocellulose and linear polyester, and a mixture of nitrocellulose and polyalkyl meth acrylate. These binders may be crosslinked with a crosslinking agent. Examples of the solvent employable in the preparation of the coating dispersion include lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n propanol and n butanol chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride and ethylene chloride ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone esters of lower alcohols with lower aliphatic acids such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and butyl acetate ethers such as dioxane, ethylene glycol monoethylether and ethylene glycol monoethyl ether and mixtures of the above mentioned compounds. The mixing ratio of the binder to the stimulable phosphor in the coating dispersion can be determined according to the characteristics of the aimed radiation image storage panel and the nature of the phosphor employed. Generally, the ratio is within the range of from 1 1 to 1 100 binder phosphor, by weight , preferably from 1 8 to 1 40. The coating dispersion may contain a disper sing agent to improve the dispersibility of the phosphor particles therein, and may contain a variety of additives such as a plasticizer for increasing the bonding between the binder and the phosphor particles in the phosphor layer. Examples of the dispersing agent include phthalic acid, stearic acid, caproic acid and a hydrophobic surface active agent. Examples of the plasticizer include phosphates such as triphenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate and diphenyl phosphate phthalates such as diethyl phthalate and dimethoxyethyl phthalate glycolates such as ethylphthalyl ethyl glycolate and butylphthalyl butyl glycolate and polyesters of polyethylene glycols with aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as polyester of triethylene glycol with adipic acid and polyester of diethylene glycol with succinic acid. The coating dispersion containing the phosphor particles and the binder prepared as described above is applied evenly onto the surface of a support to form a layer of the coating dispersion. The coating procedure can be carried out by a conventional method such as a method using a doctor blade, a roll coater or a knife coater. After applying the coating dispersion onto the support, the coating dispersion is then heated slowly to dryness so as to complete the formation of the phosphor layer. The thickness of the phosphor layer varies depending upon the characteristics of the aimed radiation image storage panel, the nature of the phosphor, the ratio of the binder to the phosphor, etc. In general, the thickness of the phosphor layer is within a range of from 20 llm to 1 mm, and preferably within a range of from 50 to 500 llm. The phosphor layer can be provided onto the support by the methods other than that given in the above. For instance, the phosphor layer is initially prepared on a sheet material such as a glass plate, a metal plate or a plastic sheet using the aforementioned coating dispersion and then thus prepared phosphor layer is superposed on the genuine support by pressing or using an adhesive agent. The phosphor layer may consist of either a single layer or plural two or more layers. In the case of two or more phosphor layers, at least one layer contains the aforementioned divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor. In any cases of a single and plural layers, a variety of known stimulable phosphors can be employed in combination with the above phosphor. The support material employed in the present invention can be selected from those employable for the radiogaphic intensifying screens in the conventional radiography or those employable for the known radiation image storage panel. Examples of the support material include plastic films such as films of cellulose acetate, polyester, polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide, polyimide, triacetate and polycarbonate metal sheets such as aluminum foil and aluminum alloy foil ordinary papers baryta paper resin coated papers pigment papers containing titanium dioxide or the like and papers sized with polyvinyl alcohol or the like. From the viewpoint of characteristics of a radiation image storage panel as an information recording material, a plastic film is preferably employed as the support material of the invention.The plastic film may contain a light absorbing material such as carbon black, or may contain a light reflecting material such as titanium dioxide. The former is appropriate for preparing a high sharpness type radiation image storage panel, while the latter is appropriate for preparing a high sensitivity type radiation image storage panel. In the preparation of a conventional radiation image storage panel, one or more additional layers are occasionally provided between the support and the phosphor layer so as to enhance the bonding strength between the support and the phosphor layer, or to improve the sensi tivity of the panel or the quality of an image provided thereby sharpness and graininess . For instance, a subbing layer or an adhesive layer may be provided by coating polymer material such as gelatin over the surface of the support on the phosphor layer side. Otherwise, a light reflecting layer or a light absorbing layer may be provided by forming a copolymer material layer containing a light reflecting material such as titanium dioxide or a light absorbing material such as carbon black.In the present invention, one or more of these additional layers may be provided on the support. As described in U.S. Patent Application No. 496,278, the phosphor layer side surface of the support or the surface of an adhesive layer, light reflecting layer, or light absorbing layer in the case where such layers provided on the phosphor layer may be provided with protruded and depressed portions for the enhancement of the sharpness of resulting image. The radiation image storage panel generally has a transparent protective film on a free surface of a phosphor layer not facing a support to protect the phosphor layer from physical and chemical deterioration. In the radiation image storage panel of the present invention, it is preferable to provide a transparent protective film for the same purpose. The protective film can be provided onto the phosphor layer by coating the surface of the phosphor layer with a solution of a transparent polymer such as a cellulose derivative e.g., cellulose acetate or nitrocellulose , or a synthetic polymer e.g., polymethyl methacrylate, polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl formal, polycarbonate, polyvinyl acetate, or vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer , and drying the coated solution. Alternatively, the protective film can be provided onto the phosphor layer by beforehand preparing it from a polymer such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polyvinylidene chloride or polyamide, followed by placing and fixing it onto the phosphor layer with an appropriate adhesive agent. The transparent protective film preferably has a thickness within the range of approx. 3 to 20 lim. For the enhancement of sharpness of the resulting image, at least a portion of the radiation image storage panel may be coloured with a colorant, as described inU.S. Patent No. 4,394,581 and U.S. Patent Application No.326,624. For the same purpose, the phosphor layer of the radiation image storage panel according to the present invention may contain a white powder, as described inU.S. Patent No. 4,350,893. The present invention will be illustrated by the following examples and comparison examples, but these examples by no means restrict the invention. Example 1 To 500 cc of distilled water H20 were added 175.34 g. of barium fluoride BaF2 , 333.18 g. of barium bromide BaBr2.2H20 , and 0.783 g. of europium bromide EuBr3 , and they were mixed to give a suspension. The suspension was dried at 60 C under reduced pressure for 3 hours and further dried at 1500C under vacuum for another 3 hours. The dry product was finely pulverized in a mortar. To 100 g. of thus pulverized product were then added 0.216 g. of scandium fluoride ScF3 and 0.1 g. of sodium bromide NaBr , and they were mixed to prepare a mixture of starting materials for a phosphor. Then, the mixture of the starting materials was placed in an alumina crucible, which was, in turn, placed in a high temperature electric furnace for firing. The firing was done at 900 C for 1.5 hours in a carbon dioxide gas atmosphere containing carbon monoxide gas. After the firing was complete, the crucible was taken out of the furnace and allowed to stand for cooling. The fired product was pulverized to obtain a powdery divalent euro pium activated barium fluorobromide phosphor BaFBr O.O023NaBr 0.0OlEu2 ,0.005Sc . Further, a variety of divalent europium activated barium fluorobromide phosphors containing the different amount of scandium were obtained by varying the amount of scandium fluoride to be added within the range of 10 10 1 mol per 1 mol of BaFBr in the above described preparation of the phosphor. Subsequently, using the obtained phosphors, a variety of radiation image storage panels were prepared in the following manner. To a mixture of the phosphor particles and a linear polyester resin were successively added methyl ethyl ketone and nitrocellulose nitrification degree 11.5 , to prepare a dispersion containing the phosphor particles. Then, tricresyl phosphate, n butanol and methyl ethyl ketone were added to the dispersion, and the mixture was sufficiently stirred by means of a propeller agitater to obtain a homogeneous coating dispersion containing the binder and the phosphor particles in the ratio of 1 20 binder phosphor, by weight and having a viscosity of 25 35 PS at 250C . Then, the coating dispersion was applied onto a polyethylene terephthalate sheet containing carbon black support, thickness 250 iim placed horizontally on a glass plate. The application of the coating dispersion was carried out using a doctor blade. After the coating was complete, the support having the coating dispersion was placed in an oven and heated at a temperature gradually rising from 25 to 1000C. Thus, a phosphor layer having the thickness of approx. 200 lim was formed on the support. On the phosphor layer was placed a transparent polyethylene. terephthalate film thickness 12 llm provided with a polyester adhesive layer to combine the film and the phosphor layer with the adhesive layer. Thus, a ra diation image storage panel consisting essentially of a support, a phosphor layer and a transparent protective film was prepared. Comparison Example 1 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except for adding no scandium fluoride to obtain a powdery divalent europium activated barium fluorobromide phosphor BaFBr 0.0023NaBr 0.001Eu2 . Using thus obtained phosphor particles, a radiation image storage panel consisting essentially of a support, a phosphor layer and a transparent protective film was prepared in the same manner as described in Example 1. The radiation image storage panels prepared in Example 1 and Comparison Example 1 were evaluated on the afterglow characteristics according to the following test. The radiation image storage panel was cut to give a test strip having a width of 7 cm. The test strip was exposed to X rays at 80 KVp and subsequently once scanned with a He Ne laser beam wavelength 632.8 nm in the direction of its width for 5x10 3 sec. to measure the decay of afterglow of the stimulated emission. The results of the evaluation on the afterglow characteristics are graphically illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 1 illustrates graphs decay curves of afterglow in which the time is plotted as the abscissa and amount of afterglow amount of stimulated emission as the ordinate Dotted curve the radiation image storage panel containing BaFBr 0.0023NaBr O.OOlEu2 ,0.005Sc phosphor, and Solid curve the radiation image storage panel con 2 taining BaFBr 0.0023NaBr O.OOlEu phosphor. Fig. 2 illustrates a graph in which the amount of scandium y value is plotted as the abscissa and the logarithmic value of amount of afterglow amount of stimulated emission as the ordinate. The amount of afterglow is a value measured at 2x10 3 sec. after exposure to aHe Ne laser beam. Example 2 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except for adding 0.15 g. of silicon dioxide SiO2 in addition to scandium fluoride and sodium bromide to 100 g. of the pulverized product, to obtain a powdery divalent europium activated barium fluorobromide phosphor BaFBr 0.0023NaBr 0.006Si0, 0.001 0.00lEu2 2 ,0.005Sc . Using thus obtained phosphor particles, a radiation image storage panel consisting essentially of a support, a phosphor layer and a transparent protective film was prepared in the same manner as described in Example 1. The radiation image storage panel prepared in Example 2 was evaluated on the afterglow characteristics by the above described test. As a result, the logarithmic value of amount of afterglow amount of stimulated emission was 3.1 for the radiation image storage panel of the present invention containing BaFBr.0.0023NaBr.0.006SiO2 0.001Eu2 , 0.005Sc phosphor, though 2.6 for the radiation image storage panel of Comparison Example 1 containing BaFBr 0.0023NaBr O.OOlEu2 phosphor see Fig. 2 .
