# HYDRAULICALLY ACTUATED RECIPROCATING PISTON PUMP

## Abstract
A hydraulically actuated multi cylinder reciprocating piston pump 10 having two double acting cylinder and piston type hydraulic actuators 38 each connected to a working fluid piston 30 and hydraulically interconnected by a control circuit to provide alternate delivery and suction strokes to the respective working fluid pistons. The piston rod chambers 52 of the hydraulic actuators are intercon nected to transfer power fluid therebetween to drive actuator pistons 48 on their return strokes. Each actuator is provided with a sleeve type pilot valve 96 interposed in a hydraulic circuit including a spool type distributing valve 124 for operating the actuators in timed relation to each other. The hydraulic circuit includes a main high pressure source 200 of actuator power fluid and a lower pressure source 118 of pilot actuator and leakage make up fluid for the actuator piston transfer circuit. The main power fluid control vave is configured to prevent stalling of the hydraulic actuators and to prevent premature shifting of the actuators so that a substantially uniform delivery of working fluid is provided by the pump.
