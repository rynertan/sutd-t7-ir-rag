# Direction indicating apparatus for vehicles.

## Abstract
A relay switch 11, 12 is connected in series with an electric power source 1 and direction indicating lamps 4 to 6, 4 to 6 so that the lamps are energized periodically by the closure of the switch activated by the periodic conduction of an output transistor of an oscillator circuit 16 . A short circuit detector circuit 30 inhibits the output transistor from being rendered conductive in response to the detection of an excessively large current flowing to the lamps. The output transistor is allowed to be rendered conductive when a surge current flows to the lamps.
