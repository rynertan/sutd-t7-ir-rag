# Vehicle transmission.

## Abstract
A vehicle transmission has an input shaft 1 from which are derived two outputs, one from gear 2 being fed via a continuously variable ratio transmission 4 of the rolling traction toroidal race kind and the other via gear 3, to a simple epicyclic gear 5 where they are combined. Output is taken either from the annulus 18 of the epicyclic gear for low forward ratios, geared neutral, and reverse or from the sun gear 15 for low to high forward ratios . The arrange ment uses an uncomplicated gearing arrangement a simple epicyclic gear to combine the two outputs because the step down gear 3 can be chosen so as to combine the outputs at an appropriate ratio.

## Description
VEHICLE TRANSMISSION This invention relates to vehicle transmissions, and particularly to those including continuously variableratio transmissions of the toroidal race rolling traction type.Such transmissions are described, for example, in PaperNo. 80 C2 DET 59 of the American Society ofEMI1.1 Engineers. In thesetransmissions, neutral and reverse are produced by combining a direct output from the vehicle engine with an indirect output taken via the continuously variable ratio transmission and reversed in sense. In this so called low regime , the ratio of the continuously variable ratio transmission is varied to produce either a low range of reverse ratios, a low range of forward ratios, or geared neutral in which the engine is rotating, but the continuouslyvariable ratio transmission s output is rotating in the opposite sense and the combined output is zero .The forward range of ratios is produced by using the output of the continuously variable ratio transmission on its own so called high regime A problem arises in combining the direct and indirect outputs for the low regime, in that to produce a desired maximum forward ratio in this regime it may be necessary to combine the direct and indirect outputs in an awkward ratio, because the particular continuously variable ratio transmission used will have an optimum range of speeds of operation, depending on roller diameter, and so will the part icular power unit. Given that the speed ranges of the direct1 and indirect output are fixed, a part icular maximum forward ratio, and hence particular maximum combined output speed, can only be met for one particular ratio of combination. The invention provides a transmission system which comprises an input shaft for connection to an engine output shaft, a rolling traction toroidal race continuously variable ratio transmission driven by the input shaft, and a simple epicyclic gear comprising a sun gear, planetary gears Gn a carrier, and an annulus, for combining the output of the continuously variable ratio transmission with the output of the input shaft, the output of the continuously variable ratio transmission being connected inl l driving relationship with one part of the epicyclic gear, the input shaft being connected via a step up or step down gear with another part of the epicyclic gear, and the output of the transmission system being taken from the third part.of the epicyclic gear. The use of the step up or step down gear from the direct output enables a simple epicyclic gear to be used to combine the outputs, while making it possible to choose any desired ratio of combination, by choosing the stepup or step down gear of the appropriate value.Advantageously, the output of the continuouslyvariable ratio transmission is connected to the sun gear and the step up or step down gear to the carrier. The output of the transmission system is then taken from the annulus.Advantageously, the output of the transmission system includes a gear which is connected by a first clutch to the annulus and by a second clutch to the output of the continuously variable ratio transmission. Engagement of one clutch and disengagement of the other thus enables the regime of the transmission system to be changed.Atransmission system constructed in accordance with the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic drawing of the transmission system Figure 2 is a schematic drawing of the transmission system showing the parts which are operative when the system is in low regime and Figure 3 is a schematic drawing of the transmission system showing the parts which are operative when the system is in high regime.Referring to the drawings, the transmission system is intended to be powered by a diesel engine not shown which is connected to an input shaft 1. The input shaft 1 has two take offs, first via a gear 2 and second via a gear 3, the first providing an indirect output via continuously variable ratio transmission indicated generally by the reference numeral 4 and the second providing a direct output. The outputs are combined by a simple epicyclic gear indicated generally by the reference numeral 5. The output of the transmission system is taken from one part of the epicyclic gear in the case of low regime and another part in the case of high regime.The gear 2 drives the continuously variable ratio transmission 4 via an idler 6 for reversing the sense of rotation and a gear 7, the gears 2 and 7 providing a step up of one and a half. The continuously variable ratio transmission 4 consists of tocoidal races 8 and 9 fixed to shaft 10 which drive toroidal races 11 and 12 via rollers 13,14 diameter 52 inches . The rollers 13,14 swing about their axes to change the ratio of the transmission between the races 8,9 and 11,12. Other rollers are present but are not shown in the drawing. A more detailed description of this kind of transmission is given inEMI5.1 the American Society of Motor Engineers paper referred to in the opening paragraphs of this specification.The simple epicyclic gear 5 consists of a sun gear 15, planets 16 and an annulus 17. The output of the continuously variable ratio transmission is taken from the outer circumference of the races 11,12 and feeds directly into the sun gear 15. The input shaft 1 is connected to the carrier 18 of the planets 16 via gear 3 which provides a step down of around a half.In the low regime, clutch 19 is engaged and clutch 20 disengaged Figure 2 the annulus 18 thus drives output shaft 21 via gears 22 and 23. The sun gear 15 is driven in the same direction as the carrier 18 because the continuously variable ratio transmission 4 reverses the sense of rotation but this is cancelled by the idler 6 and, at a certain ratio, the annulus is stationary and geared neutral is produced. At ratios above and below this value of the continuously variable ratio transmission 4, reverse and low speed forward ratios of the overall transmission system is produced.In the high regime, the annulus 18 is free, and output is taken directly from the sun gear 15 and the gears 22 and 23. At the lowest ratio of the highest regime, the sun gear 19 rotates at the same speed and in the same direction as the annular 17 and consequently both clutches 19,20 could be engaged without damaging the transmission system. Consequently gear changing is synchronous and there is no de clutching as in a conventional layshaft gearbox. An advantage of the arrangement described above is that a simple epicyclic gear is used to combine the outputs in the low regime to produce geared neutral, ss compared with more complicated compound epicyclic gears in known systems. The desired speed of the input shaft is 2000 to 3000 rpm for which the diesel engine operates at peak efficiency. The continuously variable ratio transmission 4 is essentially a low torque high speed device and operates best at a faster speed. The use of the simple epicyclic gear to combine these fixed speed range inputs is made possible by the use of the stepdown carrier drive gear 3 which can be chosen to produce any desired degree of step down.
