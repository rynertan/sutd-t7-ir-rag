# Method of and apparatus for inserting coils into stator core slots.

## Abstract
A method of and apparatus for inserting coils into slots formed in the stator core 18 of a dynamoelectric machine such as an electric motor. The stator core is assumed to have open type slots 20 . Each slot forms, in cooperation with the blades for guiding the coil 17 and a stripper 26 for forcing the coil out of the blades 11 , a closed space which has such volume as to avoid any disorder of coil wire layers when the coil is received by the closed space. After placing the coils in the closed spaces, the coils are pushed into the respective slots and, as desired, the coils are compressed further until the coil wires come to have non circular cross section. By so doing, it is possible to remarkably increase the space factor for each slot.
