## Abstract
Method of and apparatus for storing tobacco or the like in high stack and discharging the same is provided. The method comprises the steps charging tobacco into each storage chamber, storing said tobacco in a high stack having no effect on the compression to the tobacco due to its own weight, discharging the tobacco to fall onto a dis charging conveyor with changing an orientation of the to bacco layer from in a horizontal to a vertical direction the reof, transporting the tobacco layer being oriented in a vertical direction through the discharging conveyor, and detecting the completion of the discharge then to start dis charging the tobacco of the next chamber. The apparatus comprises a plurality of vertically elon gate storage chambers 6 arranged side by side in a hori zontal row, a horizontal discharging conveyor 3 disposed beneath said row of storage chambers and extending in the direction of said row, a pair of transparent tobacco support plates 11 being erected substantially in parallel to second walls 4 between said chambers and the conveyor, a floor plate 8 hinged to a first sidewall 5 of each chamber at a bottom end thereof to open and close on a downstream side of the side wall, said horizontal conveyor 3 being spaced apart from said chambers by a distance substantially equal to the size of each second sidewall, unraveling raking means 13 provided for cooperation with the discharging conveyor 3 , and a frame member 20 to support the charg ing conveyor, said frame member having a detecting means 12 for a desired stop position of the charging conveyor, and a charging conveyor 2 to charge tobacco into each of the storage chambers 6 , said charging conveyor having a detecting means 10 to detect a stack level of stacked tobacco layer in the chamber.
