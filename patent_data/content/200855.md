# Crop engaging apparatus and methods.

## Abstract
A crop cutting and conditioning apparatus has two verti cal axis rotary drum cutters 13 , each having an upper rotor with a crop conveying surface 19 and a lower rotor carry ing knives 21 . Gears drive the upper and lower rotors in counter rotation. The lower rotor has an annular rim 18 having an upper surface shaped to continue the outline of the conveying surface 19 . The knives 21 protrude out wardly from beneath the rim 18 and rotate with the rim. The upper rotor has conditioning elements comprising brushes 37 or sheets 110 of plastics material, for conveying and conditioning crop. The outer tips of the brushes 37 or the edges 133, 134 of the sheet or rib like elements 110 lie along paths leading upwardly and rearwardly relative to the intended direction of rotation of the rotor. Crop engaging elements of the rotor are arranged to extend outwardly over the crop cutting path of the knives so that cutting of crop is achieved at least in part by shear.
