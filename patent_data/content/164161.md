# Method and apparatus of manufacturing a body of a container and said body.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a body 2 for a container, in which a body 2 having a weldseam 11 along its longitudinal direction is formed by bending material in sheet form and welding the overlapping edges of the bended material together, and the wall of the body having the longitudi nal weldseam 11 is thinned. Preferably thinning is obtained by wall ironing.
