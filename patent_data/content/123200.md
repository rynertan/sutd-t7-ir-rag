# METHOD TO ELIMINATE THE EFFECTS OF MAGNETIC FIELD INHOMOGENEITIES IN NMR IMAGING

## Abstract
NMR imaging apparatus comprising apparatus for apply ing a linear magnetic field gradient to a sample, apparatus for varying the magnetic field gradient in a predetermined man ner, apparatus for obtaining an NMR signal based on the linear magnetic field gradient, apparatus for storing the NMR signal, apparatus for reconstructing an NMR image from the stored NMR signal, and display apparatus for displaying the reconstructed NMR image, and wherein the apparatus for obtaining an NMR signal includes apparatus for obtaining the NMR signal at times when cancellation of the signal compo nent dependent on magnetic field inhomogeneities occurs. There is also provided a technique for NMR imaging using the above apparatus.
