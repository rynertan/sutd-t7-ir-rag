# Deadlock detection and resolution scheme.

## Abstract
In a communication system which includes a plurality of stations 23, 24 interconnected for communications by a first bus 21 , a second station 22 includes a device, such as a processor 25 , and a resource, such as a memory 32 or a peripheral unit, interconnected for communication by a second bus 36 . An interface mechanism 34 connecting the first bus with the second bus allows the device to access the first bus over the second bus, and allows a first station to access the resource via the first and second buses. Deadlock detection circuitry 47 detects cotemporaneous attempts by the device to access the first bus and attempts by the first station to access the resource. Deadlock resolution circuitry 26 responds to deadlock detection by disconnecting the device from the second bus to allow the first station to access the resource, and by reconnecting the device to the second bus when the first station ceases to access the resource. If the device is operating under program control, the deadlock detection and resolution are transparent to the program.
