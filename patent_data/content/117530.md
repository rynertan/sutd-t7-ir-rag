# Production of N substituted meth acrylamides from meth acrylates and amines over a metal alkoxide catalyst.

## Abstract
A one step process for the preparation of N substitued meth acrylamides from the reaction of a meth acrylate es ter and an amine over a catalytic amount of a metal alkoxide catalyst is described. These catalysts, such as stannous di methoxide, lead dimethoxide, zinc dimethoxide, copper di methoxide and bismut tributoxide give high selectivity to the N substituted meth acrylamides and little selectivity to the Michael adduct propionate ester, which would predominate in the absence of these catalysts. Also, these catalysts are less costly than organo metal catalysts commonly used.
