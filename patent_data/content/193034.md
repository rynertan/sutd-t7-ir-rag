# An articulate bent pipe for transportation of powder and slurry in dry or wet state.

## Abstract
An articulate bent pipe for transportation of powder or slurry in dry or wet state is described which is composed of nodal pipes 1A 1G which are defined by splitting the angle of R by a required number, with a lining of a wear resistant pipe 2A 2G of a required thickness applied on each of said nodal pipes 1A 1G , each two of said nodal pipes 1A 1G being coupled through a packing 3 consecutively and replaceably.
