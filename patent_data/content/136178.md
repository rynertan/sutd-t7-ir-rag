# AUTOMATIC MEMORY BOARD RECONFIGURATION

## Abstract
A method for automatically reconfiguring the memory ad dress space of a plurality of memory boards allows varying capacity boards to be arbitrarily assigned to backplane loca tions without human intervention. By reading from a nonvola tile memory on each memory board, a processor can determine the proper address range to assign each memory board. It can then load this information into the borad s configuration regis ter and, if necessary, update the board s nonvolatile memory. Each memory board then uses the addresses of incoming ac cess requests and the contents of its configuration register to determine which memory components are to be accessed.
