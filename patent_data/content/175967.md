# Navigation, communication, and surveillance system based on DME.

## Abstract
The Distance Measuring Equipment DME is a well approved means for short range navigation in international civil aviation. It utilizes the inherent capacity of the system in most applications to a relatively small degree. Therefore, additional functions can be integrated into the system such as data links, ground derived slant range measurement equipment and direction finders growth potential . Thus, the DME can be extended to an Integrated Navigation, Com munication, and Surveillance System. This system may be superior by technical, as well as by economical and opera tional reasons, to conventional solutions, which use separate systems for the different function. The integrated system can be composed in different ways using different sets of the DME growth elements. A promising set is described and applied to a scenario of helicopter operations with oil rigs.
