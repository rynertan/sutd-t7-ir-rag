# LIQUID FUEL CELL

## Abstract
A liquid fuel cell having good cell characteristics, particularly a good current density voltage characteristic, comprising an anode of electroconductive porous ma terial supporting an electrode catalyst to which a liquid fuel is supplied, a cathode of electroconductive po rous material supporting an electrode catalyst to which an oxidizing agent is supplied, an electrolyte existing between the said two electrodes, and a barrier containing the electrolyte and preventing the liquid fuel from transfer to the cathode side, characterized in that the anode has a three dimensional, reticular structure allowing a gas generated by cell reaction within the anode to ascend and get released from the anode, and having a pore size for retaining a mixture of the liquid fuel and the electrolyte within the anode and a thickness for supporting a necessary amount of the electrode catalyst for the cell reaction.
