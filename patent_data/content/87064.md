# PROGRAM DEBUGGING METHOD AND SYSTEM

## Abstract
A debugging scheme is presented which enables prog rams to be debugged without the need to recompile the programs. This scheme requires the addition of a small set of instructions called debugging instructions to the instruction set of the device. These instructions are inserted at points in the program which enable debugging aids to be im plemented by traps to the operating system of the device. To decrease the reduction in program execution speed, some special hardware is added to enable traps to the operating system to be avoided when such are not necessary to implement the debugging aids which have been requested. When none of the debugging aids have been requested there is only a small decrease in program execution speed so that execution speed is only significantly affected when the program is being debugged.
