# FLOATING POINT MICROPROCESSOR

## Abstract
A microprocessor integrated circuit 50 includes a control, timing and interface section 52 connected by control signal lines 54 to each of the other functional elements shown. Section 52 is further connected to a 16 bit wide internal information bus 56 by bus 58 . Bus 60 also connects the section 52 to a 16 bit wide external informa tion bus 62 . Buffer circuit 64 connects the external information bus 62 to the internal information bus 56 . The internal information bus 56 is connected by bus 66 to a programmable shifter and unpacker section 68 . The section 68 is connected to a Mantissa processor 70 by a 64 bit wide bus 72 and by two 32 bit wide buses 74 and 76 . The shifter 68 is connected to an exponent processor 78 by 16 bit wide buses 80 and 82 . The Mantissa processor 70 is also connected to the internal information bus 56 by bus 84 . The sign logic circuits 86 are connected to the programmable shifter and unpacker section 68 by line 88 . Mantissa processor 70 includes a 32 bit arithmetic and logic unit ALU , a variable width register file, working registers and flipflops, control PLAs, detection logic and bus buffers. The exponent and sign processor 78 includes a 16 bit wide ALU, variable width register file, working registers, control and constants PLAs detection logic and sign logic and flipflops. The programmable shifter and unpacker 68 is a 64 bit wide shifter capable of shifting in one machine cycle from 0 to 8 positions to the left or 0 to 24 positions to the right. The control timing and interface section 52 is based on a two level microprogramming scheme to save micro code ano to optimize execution times on a dynamic micro cycle.
