## Description
TITLE Hydrogen Cyanide Manufacturing ProcessDESCRIPTIONTechnical Field This invention relates to processes for the manufactune of hydrogen cyanide and more particularly to such processes which utilize converter off gases and supplementary hydrocarbon feedstocks.Background Art Hydrogen cyanide is a versatile chemical useful in the preparation of a wide variety of chemical products. With a continuing rise in cost of hydrocarbon feedstocks useful in its manufacture, it becomes desirable to increase the carbon utilization from feedstock to product. One commercial process for the manufacture of hydrogen cyanide is the Andrussow process which involves the catalytic reaction of a gaseous hydrocarbon usually methane, ammonia and air using platinum or a platinum alloy typically a platinum rhodium gauze as the catalyst. This process is described byAndi ussow in U.S. Patent 1,934,838 issued November 14, 1933, and by Jenks in U.S. Patent 3,14,945. There have been numerous patents granted over the years relating to improvements in the Andrussow process.Typically, these improvements are directed to increased yields or better recovery of hydrogen cyanide from the reaction gases. The Andrussow process is uniquely dependent on methane as a raw material. Although a number of patents e.g., Andrussow, U.S. 1,934,839 disclose the use ol higher hydrocarbons, and they can be used for short times in laboratory scale experiments, they are not used industrially because o severe carburlzation of the platinum rhodium gauze catalysts. Even z few percent of higher hydrocarbons mixed with 95 or more methane causes rapid carberization. This reduces yields and conversions and, if continued, leads to an actual physical disintegration of the catalyst gauze structures with attendant loss of catalyst. Although minor carburization occurs with pure methane, it is relatively slow yields and conversions decrease only moderately and the catalyst gauze lasts for several months. Carburization of the catalyst becomes more rapid and severe as larger quantities of higher hydrocarbons are substituted for methane in the feed. Thus, when methane supplies are curtailed, or shut off completely, alternative hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane, liquid petroleum gas, gasoline or naphtha cannot now be directly substituted to maintain production of hydrogen cyanide. A further problem with the Andrussow synthesis is relatively low carbon yield even when the preferred pure methane feedstock is used. The yield loss results from the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide as byproducts, along with substantial amounts of hydrogen. Carbon yields range from about 60 70 depending on the amount of oxygen any ammonia fed concurrently with the methane. Somewhat improved yields result from using higher ratios of ammonia methane thn the standard 1 1 ratio, but thia reduces the yield based on ammonia It also tends to overload the ammonia recovery and recycle systems which are often the output ting portions of an Andrussow hydrogen cyanide plant.Since the theoretical Andrsscw reaction is close to an explosive range, i.e. EMI2.1 the actual reaction is conducted so as to be lean in oxygen and dilted wit nitrogen from air. The result ins reaction off gases thus contain hydrogen cyanide, unreacted ammonia, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and water. After unreacted ammonia is recovered U.S. Patents 2,797,148, issued June 1957 to Carlson, and 3,718,731, issued February 27, 1973 toCarlson and Hess and hydrogen cyanide and water condensed from the reaction gases, the resulting waste off gases composed of the carbon oxides, hydrogen and nitrogen are burned. It would be desirable, therefore, to recover the carbon and hydrogen values now lost in the Andrussow exit gases and convert these into hydrogen cyanide product without penalizing the ammonia yield or overloading the ammonia recycle svstem. It would also be desirable to be able to use alternate fuels and hydrocarbon feedstocks during periods of curtailment of natural gas supplies. Scary of the Invention According to the present invention there is provided in a process for the manufacture of hydrogen cyanide by contacting a fed of methane, ammonia and a source cf oxygen with an oxidation catalyst in a reaction zoe and separating hydrogen cyanide, water and unreacted ammonia from the product gases to give waste off gas, the improvement ccmprising 1 purging an amount of off gas sufficient to reduce the number of moles of nitrogen contained in a retained portion of off gas to essentially that present in the reactable gases, preferably the original reac. e gases 2 adusting the atomic ratios of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen in the retained off gas by the addi tion of a carbon containing fluid and optionally hydrogen such that H equals 0.5 1.3 of 4 O 2 O where gram atoms of hydrogen from all sources in the adjusted off gas gram atoms of carbon from all sources in the adjusted off gas 0 gram atoms of oxygen from all sources in the adjusted of gas 3 contacting the retained adjusted off gas with a methanation catalyst such that as to substantially completely convert the carbon contained therein t methane 4 condensing and removing water formed 5 mixing the methanated off gas with ammonia, oxygen and additional methane, if needed, to reconstitute the original feed and 6 passing the mixture front step 5 to the reaction zone. The present invention allows the use of hydrocarbon off gases from the Andrussow prccess to be used with supplementary hydrocerbons feedstock to prepaee additional methane for the process. In the event of a reduction in the supply of methane, the art Andrussow process must either be reduced correspondingly or shut down. By practicing the present invention, other hydrocarbon feed stocks can be used by keeping the process going until methane supply is restored. Detailed Description of the Invention According to the present improvement, a small amount of off gas should be purged each cycle to remove essentially all nitrogen formed by side reactions sus. as the thermal cracking of ammonia ts hydrogen and nitrogen or ammonia oxidation to nitrogen plus water. Unless removed by purging, the nitrogen and total gas volume will increase with each recycle stage.The amount to be purged can be calculated by EMI5.1 tb moles SEP of SEP N2 SEP SEP moles SEP SEP of SEP N2 SEP tb moles SEP of SEP off gas SEP to SEP SEP in SEP off grsê SEP in SEP feed SEP gasê SEP tb be SEP purged SEP per SEP pass SEP mole SEP SEP fraction SEP of SEP N2 SEP in SEP off SEP tb SEP gas SEP tb SInce the waste off gases are rich in hydrogen, a carbon containing fluid must usually be added to the of gases in crder to adjust the molar ratio of carbon to hydrogen. Useful carbon containing fluids are carbon oxides carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide or A mixture of the two , synthesis gas, an alkanol of 1 4 carbon atoms, particularly methanol, and a hydrocarbon of 2 10 carbon atoms, particularly olefins such as ethylene or propylene, and volatile hydrocarbons such as naphtha, propane and liquified petroleum gas. Methanol and naphtha are most preferred. Any easily volatilized carbon source can be used which is free of catalyst poison. Certain material can poison the catalyst.The carbon source should not contain more than 1.5 benzene, 0.5 ppm of hydrogen disulfide, 2 ppm of mercaptans, 5 water, 20 carbon dioxide or 1 of ammonia, phenol or hydrogen cyanide. The required adjustment of the ratio of hydrogen to carbon and oxygen prior tc methanation ca, be calculated as indicated below. Let Ca gram atoms of carbon to be added as a supple mentary source of carbon, Cf gram atoms of carbon desired in feed, Ce gram atoms of carbon in retained off gas after purging.Then C a Cf Ce Following addition of the supplemental carbon, it may be necessary to add some supplemental hydrogen to adjust the overall hydrogen to carbon and oxygen proportions to the desired values prior to methanation.This supplemental hydrogen is conveniently and preferably added as molecular hydrogen. To calculate this, let C gram atoms cf carbon in mixture including that in the rained off gas and in the added carbon source, Of gram atoms of oxygen in mixture including that in the retained off gas and in the added carbon source, Hf gram atoms of hydrogen in mixture including that in the retained gas and in the added carbon source, Ha gram atoms of additional hycrogen to be added as H2 gas. Then H a 4Cf 20f Hf. It should be noted that 5t is not essential to maintain the exact stoichiometric ratios discussed above. If we designate the quantity of 4 C 2 0 as K, then broadly, the ratio of hydrogen atoms to K can range from about 0.9 to 1.3K and preferably from 0.95 to l.lK. Since both the hydrogenation of carbon carbon bonds to methane and reduction of carbon oxygen bonds to C H and H2O are strongly favored thermo dynamically, it is not necessary to use ratios of hydrogen to carbon, or hydrogen to oxygen, greatly in excess of the stoichiometric amounts indicated in the formula used for K. Indeed, large excesses of hydrogen interfere to some degree with the Andrussow process and should be avoided. Hydrogen itself is valuable therefore, large excesses of hydrogen would represent a needless economic loss. Low values of hydrogen, substantially less than 0.9K, should be avoided since there would be insuf icient hydrogen present to convert all carbon compounds to methane. An unnecessary carbon yield loss would thereby result. Low hydrogen values are particularly bad if higher hydrocarbons are used as the supplementary carbon feed, due to the carburization problems which were discussed earlier. An example of the calculation of K and of the appropriate adjustment of hydrogen to K using several possible supplementary carbon feeds is as follows A typical Andrussow feed and product stream representative of current practice is given in equation 1 where all quantities are given in moles EMI7.1 Prior to the invention, in the typical practice of the art, the SH3 is selectively adsorbe and recycled, the hydrogen cyanide and H2O condensed and the hydrogen cynaide separated and the remaining streams of the com position 4.2CO 21H2 56. 1N2 0.7C02 burned as fuel. The hydrogen cyanide yield in this example based on methane is 65 and that based on NH3 is 70 . Using the process of the present invention, a small purge of 3.04 moles of product gas is burned as fuel. This removes the N2 formed by NH3 decomposition and gives a stream of the composition Eq. I A 4.05CO 20.24H2 0.67CO2 56N2 If propane C3H8 is the supplementary feedstock of voice, 3.09 moles of propane deter nined by Ca Cf Ce and 0.79 moles cf H2 determined by Fa t4Cf 20f Hf is added and the mixture passed ove a methanation catalyst according to EMI8.1 After condensation and removal of H20, 14 moles of WH3 and 14 moles of 2 is added to reconstitute the original feed of 14CH4 14NH3 1402 56N2. Note that this procedure raises the CH4 yield to 98.71 from 65 . Observe also that a plant could continue to run indefinitely using CH4 as a reactant but with no outside supply ofCH4 as such.That is, the hydrocarbon needs for the synthesis would come solely from the added propane and the byproduct CO and CO2, but the highly preferredCH4 would still be the actual reactant at the time of synthesis. Similar reactions using CO, H2 CH30H, C2H6, and a CloH22 naphtha as alternative hydrocarbon faea stocks are shown in equations 3 through 6 .EMI8.2 To achieve this composition, 9.28 moles of CO and 22.43 moles of H2 is added to the purged off gas of Eq. 1 A .The water is condensed and 14 moles each of NH3 and oxygen added as previously shown. If methanol is the supplementary carbon source,EMI8.3 To achieve the desired composition, 9.28 moles of CH3OH and 22.43 moles of H2 is added to the purged off gas from thr Andrussow reacticn. After being paused through the methanator, the H2 0 is condensed and NH3 and 02 added to reconstitute the desired feed. Using ethane as a supplementanj carbon source EMI9.1 Note that the use of a hydrogen rich supplemental carbon source such as ethane in Eq. 5 does not require the addition of supplemental H2 as hydrogen gas. This is the reason for the appearance of a small excess of H2 on the right hand side of Eq. 5 . The ratio of atoms of hydrogen to K in this instance is 1.02 which is within the permissible ranges. The methanation step involves contacting the adjusted off gas with a methanation catalyst. The catalyst will generally be a high surface area metal or supported metal from Group VIII of the periegic table. These include e, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pt, Os, Ir and Pud and their mixtures, with nickel being preferred.Supports include silica, alumina, alumina silicates, titana, zirconia, zircon, silicon carbide, carbon and other refractory inert materials. When auxiliary carbon fluids include higher hydrocarbons such as naphtha, it is often advantageous ts employ supports of an acidic character such as amorphous aluminasilicates and natural or synthetic zeolites. Such acidic supports assist the methanation process by cracking the hydrocarbon tc a lower molecular weight. The temperature range for methanation is from 220 to 4900C. At temperatures below 2200C, rates become undesirably slow and the preferred nickel catalysts are attacked by carbon monoxide to form volatile nickel carbonyls. Above 4900C, the catalysts tend to be thermally unstable towards sintering and grain growth of both the Group VIII metals and the supports. A temperature range from 2800C to 4500C is preferred. The reaction is not particularly influenced by pressure, and pressures from 103 to 6890 k pascals 15 psi to 1000 psi are operable. Since the Andrussow reaction is normally run at relatively low pressures, a pressure range from about 137 to 1370 k pascals 20 psi to 200 psi is preferred. Contact times depend upon many variables such czs catalyst surface area, temperatures, gas phase composition, loading of the Group VIII metals, the physics. form of the catalyst, etc. Generally, they 4 will range between 10 seconds and 10 seconds. Con tact times of from 10 to 3 seconds are preferred. A variety of types of catalyst beds can be employed such as fixed beds, fluidized beds, fixed beds with interstage cooling, etc. Fluidized beds and fixed beds with interstage cooling are preferred because of the exothermic nature of methanation reactions and the thermal instability of the catalysts above about 480 C. Certain materials, as mentioned earlier, interfere with the methanation reaction by poisoning the catalyst. Thus, the feed gas to the methanator should not contain more than 1.5 benzene, 0.5 ppm of hydrogen disulfide, 2 ppm of mercaptans, 5 water, 20 carbon dioxide or 1 of ammonia, phenol or hydrogen cyanide. The process of the inventicn can be run with partial recycle or total recycle. For partial recycle sufficient methane is available for teed to the hydrogen cyanide converter so that otly a portion of the off g ses have to be ut lized to bring the onverter feed to capacity. Similarly, all of the off gases can be recycled for methanation and additional methane added to the methanated off gases to bring the converter feed to capacity. On the other hand, if methane is not available and the off gases with a supplementary hydrocarbon feedstock are needed to provide methane to run the converter, additional hydrogen can be added to the off gases if they do not contain sufficient hydrogen for the methanation reaction.In this latter event, methane cin be used to start the process and then the process feed shifted to run on the off gases and other hydrocarbon source. The invention can be further understood by the following examples in which parts and percentages are on a molar basis unless otherwise indicated. Since the Andrussow portion of the process of this invention does not differ appreciably from the conventional process, this and following examples will show only the methanation step of the invention.Example 1 The catalyst used was a 56 by weight, reduced nickel on a KiesslTuhr naturally occurring silica support. The surface area was 125 square meters per gram and the pore volume was 0.18 cc gram 41.5 by volume pores . The catalyst was in the form of 8 16 mesh pellets. Fifteen grams of catalyst were used in a 5 inch long by 3 8 inch diameter 15.7 cm x 0.95 cr cylindrical reactor immersed in a fluidized, thermostatically controlled sand bath. The inlet flow of feed gases was approximately 300 cc min ute giving a superficial contact time with the catalysts of 0.77 seconds. Flows of all gaseous feeds were controlled by mass flow controllers.Liquids e.g., methanol, naphtha were fed by a liquid syringe pump. Concentratisns of all compounds in both feed and product streams were determined by a gas chromatograph. In this example, an Andrussow exit gas stream containing 60 moles of N2 5 moles of CO, and 25 moles of H2 was mixed with. 10 moles of CH3OH as a supplementa carbon and hydrogen source. The exact analysis of the entering feed gas was 25.588 H2, 11.33 CH3OH, 57.52 N2 and 5.57 CO. The reactor was maintained at 2500C.The exit gas contained 08 H2, 13.04 H2O, 0.03 CH3OH, 67.28 N2 and 19.648 CA4. The analytical exit stream is somewhat lower in H2 and higher in CH4 and N2 than anticipated. This may have been caused by some condensation of H2O in the lines prior to analysis, thus increasing the apparent concentration of the gaseous components, N2 and CH4.This compares with an expected exit gas composition of 16.678 H2O, 67.67 N2 and 16.678 CH4 assuming the intended feed or a composition of 16.68 H2O, 64.41 N2, 2.24 CO and 16.68 CH assuming the analytical feed. In either event, essentially allCO and CH3OH were reduced and converted to methane. The H2O can be condensed, an appropriate amount of ammonia and oxygen added and the above methanated adjusted feed will be a satisfactory feed for theAndrussow process.Example 2 This is an example of the use of a mixture of methanol and propylene as supplementary feedstock for an Andrussow process. As in Example 1 only the methanation step is inclttded. The experimental equipment, catalyst and contact time used were the same as Example 1. The temperature used was 3500C.The analytical feed in percent to the methanator was as follows 17.06H2, 3.19C3H6, 4. 63CH3OH, 75. 13N2. The expected exit gas composition in percent assuming complete methanation would be 2.95H2, 14.67CH4, 4. 8H2O , 77.60N2. The observec composition in percent by analysis was 1.05H2, l8.59CH4, 5.98H20, 71 3 N2 Again it is clear that all CH3OH and propyler. were converted to CH4. Tt should be noted in this example, as well as the others, that the moles of exit gas do not equal the moles of gaseous feed so it is not possible to sum the percent carbon in the feed and have it equal to the percent carbon in the exit gases.Since no propylene or unreacted methanol was detected in the exit gases, it is clear that, following condensation of water, this exit gas could be mixed with an appropriate amount of ammonia and oxygen to furnish a satisfactory feed for an Andrussow reaction.Example 3 Best Mode This is an ex2 nple of the addition of naphtha to an Andrussow exit gas containing H2, CO and N2.As in Examples 1 and 2, only the methanation step is shown. The apparatus, catalyst and contact time is as described in Example 1 but the temperature is 4000C. The naphtha used was a fraction boiling between 115 and 120eC, having a density of 0.7691 g cc at 25eC and having an analysis of 85.77 C and 14.30 H2. This is almost exactly a 2 1 ratio of hydrogen to carbon atoms. The boiling point and density were consistent with a mixture of approximately eight carbon chain length cycloaliphatic and aliphatic hydrocarDons and olefins. For example methylcyclohexane BP 1010C, d 0.765 g cc ethylcyclohexane BP 1320C, d 0.784 g cc octane BP 125.60C, d 0.698 g cc 1 octene BP 1210C, d 0.711 g cc. Since the naphtha fraction was a complex mixture, and the molecular weight therefore not known exactly, a feed of approximately one volume percent in the gaseous phase was used but the precise feed depends on the actual molecular weight. Based on the average of feed gas analysis, the feed was 1 Naphtha 24.63 H2 68.00 N2 7.1 9 COThe average of 5 exit gas or product shots was 17.27 CH4 81.46 N2 1.408 H2O.This checks well with the 17.86 CH4 expected for 100 methanation assuming 1 of a C8H16 naphtha was fed.The H2O analysis is low, however. In any event, the absence of higher hydrocarbons and unreacted CO shows this would be a satisfactory Andrussow feed after condensation of H2O and addition of NH3 and 02.
