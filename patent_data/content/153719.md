# Method and apparatus for controlling the gain of an amplifier system.

## Abstract
A variable gain amplifier 4 is adjusted to maintain its amplification with a linear range, i.e., to prevent saturation of the amplifier, by utilizing the output of an analog to digital converter 8 , which is arranged to convert an analog output of the amplifier to a digital representation, by a digital computer 10 to effect the gain change of the amplifier. Concurrently, the output signal of the digital computer 10 representing the output signal from the analog to digital converter 8 is modified to produce a system output signal based on a constant overall gain of the system which is equivalent to the highest available gain from the amplifier. Thus, while the amplifier gain is adjusted by the computer in response to the amplitude of the input signal, the overall system gain is maintained at a level which would be available at the highest amplifier gain. The digital output of the system can subsequently be utilized as a control signal either directly or after a digital to analog conversion.
