# Data processing system with a slave computer.

## Abstract
In a data processing system having a slave computer con necting to a host central processing unit 31 and a host main memory 35 , the slave computer includes an arithmetic logic operating means 25 . The arithmetic logic operating means 25 calculates an address of the host main memory 35 . A DMA interface 23 directly makes an access to the host main memory 35 to fetch operand data into the slave computer. The arithmetic logic operating means 25 computes the ope rand data under control of a microprogram control section 27 and directly loads the computed result to the host main memo ry 35 through the DMA interface 23 .
