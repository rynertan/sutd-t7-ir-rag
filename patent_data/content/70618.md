## Description
CHEMICAL PROCESS This invention relates to a chemical process and more particularly to a highly selective method for the asymmetric epoxidation of an allylic or homoallylic alcohol. Methods have been proposed for the asymmetric epoxidation of olefinic compounds with the object of producing chiral epoxides which are of great potential value in the fields of biochemistry and synthetic chemistry, both scientifically and industrially. In general, methods involving metal catalysed epoxidation with alkyl hydroperoxides in the presence of a wide selection of chiral ligands have not been completely satisfactory, the optical inductions achieved being some what disappointing. More recently, K. B. Sharpless et al have reported J. Amer. Chem. Soc., Vol. 102, 5974, 1980 a method of making optically active epoxides from primary allylic alcohols which involves the use of tert butyl hydroperoxide and titanium tetraisopropoxide in the presence of or diethyl tartrate, other closely related reagents being relatively ineffective. It has now surprisingly been found that these asymmetric transformations can be effected under a wider range of reaction conditions if diethyl tartrate is replaced by a chiral amino alcohol.This finding is in contrast to the previously reported S. Yamada, T Mashiko and S Terashima, J Amer. Chem. Soc.,Vol. 99, 1988, 1977 use of amino alcohols N alkylephedrines in the molybdenum based asymmetric epoxidation of allylic alcohols where the highest optical induction obtained was 33 . Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the preparation of a chiral epoxy alcohol which comprises reacting a primary allylic or homoallylic alcohol under anhydrous conditions with at least a stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide or an alkyl or aryl hydroperoxide in the presence of a Ti complex and a chiral amino alcohol having at least one centre of chirality. Primary allylic alcohols which may be employed in the method of the invention include compounds of the formula EMI2.1 wherein each of R1, R2 and R3, independently, represents hydrogen or an optionally substituted alkyl or aryl radical.Corresponding homoallylic alcohols may also be used. As specific examples of suitable alcohols there may be mentioned allyl alcohol, crotyl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol, 2 phenylcinnamyl alcohol and geraniol. Hydroperoxides which may be used in the method of the invention include tert butyl hydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide. Ti IV TiIV complexes which may be used include, in particular, the alkoxides, for example titanium tetraiso Ti IV propoxide. If desired, the TiIV complex may be formed in situ from other titanium compounds in known manner. The chiral amino alcohol used in the method of the invention contains an amino group which is preferably a primary or secondary amino group, a hydroxyl group which is preferably a primary or secondary hydroxyl group and at least one centre of chirality. The amino and hydroxyl groups are preferably attached to adjacent carbon atoms. Specific examples of suitable amino alcohols include aliphatic compounds such as L 2 amino l propanol, D 2 amino l butanol and L 2 amino 3 methyl l butanol, aryl substituted aliphatic compounds such as L 2 amino 3 phenyl l propanol and or ephedrine and heterocyclic compounds such as L prolinol. In carrying out the method of the invention, the peroxide or hydroperoxide is used in an amount that is at least equivalent to the allylic or homoallylic alcohol and it is advantageous to use approximately two equivalents thereof for each equivalent of the alcohol. The TiIV complex and the chiral amino alcohol are generally used in substantially equimolar amounts. The amounts of each to be used relative to the allylic or homoallylic alcohol depends upon the reactivity of the latter. In the case of the more reactive alcohols con Ti IV taining electron donating substituents, the TiIV complex and the amino alcohol can be used in catalytic amounts, for example 0.1 mole of each per mole of allylic alcohol.With the less reactive allylic alcohols, it is necessary to use substantially stoichiometric amounts of the TiIV complex and the amino alcohol relative to the allylic alcohol for the reaction to be completed within a reasonable time. The reaction is conveniently performed in an inert solvent, that is to say in a solvent which is inert with respect to the reaction mixture components. Suitable solvents include hydrocarbons, for example toluene, halogenated hydrocarbons such as r.ethylene dichloride, 1,2dichloroethane and chloroform, and especially polar aprotic solvents such as acetone and ethyl acetate which can lead to improved optical yields. The most suitable reaction temperature depends to some extent on the particular reactants being used, especially in respect of the degree of optical selectivity obtained. A temperature in the range of 500C to 500C is 0 0 generally suitable, the range of 30 to 20 C being preferred. A significant advantage for the method of the invention over the prior art method referred to above is the convenience of being able to carry out the reaction at normal ambient temperatures. The reaction is continued until it has reached substantial completion and generally takes a few hours depending upon the particular reactants and reaction temperature being employed. The reaction product may then be isolated using completely conventional methods. The method of the invention results in a high yield of epoxy alcohol, yields of approximately 90 being common. For a given allylic alcohol, the optical yield, that is the degree of enantioselectivity produced by the method of the invention, varies according to the particular amino alcohol employed. With sone amino alcohols, the excess of one epoxy alcohol enantiomer over a 50 50 mixture of enantiomers can be 60 90 or even higher. The optical yield can be determined by a standard chiral shift n.m.r. spectroscopy method. The invention is illustrated but not limited by the following Examples.Example 1 50 ml of dry reagent grade 1,2 dichloroethane was poured into a 100 ml 2 neck round bottom flask with magnetic stirrer and cooled to 200C in an acetone dry ice bath.After thorough purging with nitrogen gas, 1.42g 5 mmol of titanium tetraisopropoxide and 0.375g 5 mmol of L 2 amino propanol were added to the flask via a serum cap and allowed to stir for 15 minutes. After the addition of 1.05g 5 mmol of 2 phenyl cinnamyl alcohol and stirring for a further 15 minutes, 3.2 ml of a dichloroethane solution 0.28g TBHP ml containing 10 mmol of anhydrous tert butyl hydroperoxide were added and the reaction allowed to proceed at 200C for approximately 17 hours, after which time the epoxidation was substantially complete as judged by T.L.C. monitoring. 20 ml of 10 aqueous tartaric acid solution were added to the mixture which was stirred and allowed to warm up to room temperature ca. 20 minutes . After separation of the organic layer and acetvlation with 5 ml of acetic anhydride 5 ml of pyridine, H.P.L.C. methods were used to isolate 1.16g 87 of the product oil, the epoxy acetate from 2 phenyl cinnamyl alcohol. Analysis of the product by Eu hfbc 3 chiral shift n.m.r. spectroscopy gave an otpical yield of 60 e e enantiomeric excess .Example 2The procedure described in Example 1 was repeated except that the L 2 aminopropanol was replaced by 0.825g 5 mmol of or ephedrine. 1.18g 88 of the epoxy acetate product was isolated fran the reaction mixture, having an optical yield of 72 e e by Eu hfbc 3 shift n.m.r. spectroscopy. Example 3The procedure described in Example 1 was repeated except that the L 2 aminopropanol was replaced by 0.505g 5 mmol of L 2 pyrrolidine methanol i.e. prolinol . 1.27g 90 of the epoxy acetate product was isolated, and exhibited an optical yield of 90 by Eu hfbc 3 shift n.m.r. spectroscopy.Example 4The procedure described in Example 1 was repeated except that the L 2 aminopropanol was replaced by 0.825g 5 m mol of ephedrine and the 1,2 dichloroethane was replaced by acetone. The epoxy acetate product exhibited an optical yield of 90 by Eu hfbc 3 shift nmr spectroscopy.
