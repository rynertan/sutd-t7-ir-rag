# Absorption heat pump.

## Abstract
An absorption heat pump comprising a heat mass ex changer 57 which is arranged in an absorber 3 and has a metal pipe 77 to which a metal fin is secured. The metal fin consists of a number of interconnected lamellae 81 which extend helically around the pipe 77 , while adjacent lamel lae 81 of successive turns partially overlap each other in the circumferential direction of the pipe 77 . The finned pipe 77 yields a comparatively strong heat mass transfer in the absorber 3 .
