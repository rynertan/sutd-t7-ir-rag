# METHOD OF INPUTTING MACHINING INFORMATION TO A MACHINE TOOL NUMERICAL CONTROLLER AND APPARATUS THEREFOR

## Abstract
A numerical controller for a machining center is pro vided with a microprocessor, which selectively executes an automatic programming function and a numerical control function. In the automatic programming function, the micro processor selectively displays on a screen of a CRT display unit various pieces of enabling information for aiding an operator to input various pieces of machining information including the blank and finish shapes of a workpiece to be machined and a mounting position where the workpiece is set up on a work table of the machining center. The operator successively inputs the various pieces of machining informa tion by manipulating a key board type data input device in response to the various pieces of enabling information selectively displayed on the CRT screen, and the various pieces of machining information are stored in a data storage device. Based upon the stored machining information, the microprocessor then displays on the CRT screen the blank shape and the finish shape of the workpiece so that the operator can make sure whether the machining information has been correctly input or not. Unless the revision or modification of the stored machining information is re quired, the microprocessor then prepares the NC program based upon the stored machining information. The microp rocessor, when given a machining start command, executes the numerical control function and controls the operation of the machining center in accordance with the NC program prepared and stored in the data storage device.
