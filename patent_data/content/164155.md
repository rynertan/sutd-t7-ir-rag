# A silencer and a method of manufacturing the silencer.

## Abstract
A silencer comprising a longish cylindrical casing as sembled from two half cylindrical shell members is produced by placing in one of the shell members a row of modular chan nel blocks and then completing the silencer by mounting the other shell member over the row of blocks. The modular blocks are selected from a multi store holding groups of blocks of generally uniform outer shapes, but prefabricated with mutual ly different inner shapes such that the different blocks, each one or each pair thereof, show specific characteristics with respect to the throttling and or sound damping capacity, whereby effective silencers for different engines are easy and cheap to manufacture, even with the use of non corroding materials.
