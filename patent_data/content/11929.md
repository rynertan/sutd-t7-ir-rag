# Toilet apparatus.

## Abstract
Toilet apparatus wherein a toilet bowl 12 discharges into a holding tank and a closure member 28 is provided for opening and closing the discharge outlet 16 from the bowl to the holding tank. The closure member 28 is in the form of a pivotal plate spring urged at all times into engagement either with a seal at the bottom of the outlet 16 or with a track displaced one side of the outlet. Means are provided under control of a mechanism 66 for opening a flushing valve connecting to a tube 124 simultaneously with operation of the plate 28 to direct flushing liquid to a nozzle outlet 96 . Part of the liquid dispensed from the nozzle 96 passes to a tube 134 provided with a liquid trap and arranged to dis charge onto the top surface of the plate 28 when the plate is in its open position. The tube 134 has a check valve at the outlet to prevent back flow therethrough. Preferably the inlet to the flush control valve is so constructed as to facilitate damage free connection to a flush water supply duct.
