# A high turbulence boiler.

## Abstract
The burner operated boiler comprises a combustion chamber 16d which, at least in front of the burner, is defined by a concave wall section having its concavity facing the burner. This concave section may be part of a substantially cylindrical or elliptical or semicylindrical surface. To reach the chimney smoke moves along a smoke sleeve which is of a substantially annular shape and has a vertical axis. In addition to the smoke sleeve, there is provided at least one vertical smoke conduit 30 so that any soot depositing thereon will return to the underlying combustion chamber 16d . Prior to being exhausted into the chimney, the smoke from the smoke conduits joins the smoke directly entering into the smoke sleeve.
