# Improved carbonylation process recycling a portion of the reacted gas.

## Abstract
There is provided an improved continuous homogeneous catalytic carbonylation process wherein a mixed gas stream is removed from the carbonylation reactor, condensable liquids separated from said gas stream and said gas stream vented, the improvement comprising contacting said gas stream with a plurality of hollow fiber membranes selectively permeable to hydrogen under conditions substantially non degrading of the membranes generating a non permeated gas stream gas stream of higher carbon monoxide content and recycling said non permeated gas stream to the carbonylation process reac tor. There is also provided for the recovery and recycle to the process of carbonylation products such as acetic or propionic acids by adsorption and removal from a solid adsorbent or ab sorption in a liquid absorbent.
