# SELF RECUPERATIVE BURNERS

## Abstract
A self recuperative burner 10 in which the incoming combustion air is preheated by heat exchange with products of combustion in a cross flow ceramic plate heat exchange unit 18 which is mounted as an integral part of the burner 10 in refractory material structure which forms the combustion zone as well as carrying a fuel feed lance 39 leading to the combustion zone, the refractory material structure also form ing an air supply passage 36 connecting the air passages of the heat exchange unit 18 to the combustion zone and a combustion products exhaust flow passage 33 leading from the furnace interior to the exhaust passages of the heat exchange unit 18. The combustion air is conveyed past the exhaust flow twice in the heat exchange unit 18.
