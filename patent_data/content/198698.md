# Integrated circuit device having strip line structure therein.

## Abstract
An integrated circuit device 1 includes at least one semi conductor chip 3 having a plurality of circuit elements a pack age 21 to 24 enclosing the semiconductor chip with a her metic seal and a strip line unit 15 2, 11 1b, 11 2, 20 and 23 15 1, 11 1, 11 2, 11 3, 12 1 and 20 for connecting the circuit elements in the semiconductor chip to circuitry outside the package. The stripline unit has a microstrip line structure and a triplate strip line structure serial connected to the micro strip line structure and connecting the outside circuits. The triplate strip line structure has a characteristic impedance equal to that of the microstrip line structure so that the strip line unit satisfies the required impedance matching. A center of the conductive layer strip line of the triplate strip line structure has a smaller width than that of a microstrip line of the microstrip line structure to have a predetermined im pedance so that the triplate strip line structure has a same char acteristic impedance as that of the microstrip line structure.
