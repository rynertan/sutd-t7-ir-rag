# PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF A CONTINUOUS SHEET OF FOAMED SYNTHETIC, THERMOPLASTIC POLYMER BY EXTRUSION

## Abstract
The density of the foam is reduced and the thickness of the sheet 12 obtained by extrusion expansion is increased by grasping the sheet between confining walls 22 which are permeable to gas, and movable together with the sheet, and which diverge from each other in the direction of advance of the sheet, and by applying a subatmospheric pressure to the faces of the sheet through the said walls, while the sheet is in its plastic state, after which the sheet is gelled by cooling to stabilise the thickness S achieved.
