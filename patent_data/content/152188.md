# Damper seal apparatus.

## Abstract
In general, a sealing apparatus for substantially prevent ing the flow of air through a damper assembly having a plurality of movable vanes includes a first, rigid sealing member having a generally circular cross section and adapted to be attached to a first edge of a first movable vane. The first edge is movable through a first arc between a damper open position and a damper closed position. A second resilient sealing member has a generally rectangular cross section and is adapted to be attached to a second edge of a second movable vane. The second edge is movable through a second arc between the damper open and dam per closed positions. The sealing members make substan tially line contact one with the other as the edges are moved toward the damper closed position and are in substantially gas flow preventing area contact one with the other when the vanes are in the damper closed position.
