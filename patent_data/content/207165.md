## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION VECTOR FOR EXPRESSION AND SECRETION OF POLYPEPTIDE, MICROORGANISM TRANSFORMED BY THE VECTOR AND PRODUCTION OF POLYPEPTIDE WITH THE MICROORGANISM TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to vectors for expression and secretion of a polypeptide, microorganisms transformed by the vector, and preparation of the polypeptide with use of the microorganism. BACKGROUND ART Processes have already been established for producing interferon, growth hormones and various other polypeptides by gene technology using host cells ofEscherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, yeast and the like.However, these processes, although established, have some problems still remaining to be solved, and it is not always easy to prepare polypeptides which are exactly identical with those naturally occurring. One of the most aerious problems of these is that it is difficult to obtain polypeptides with an N terminus which is identical in structure to the corresponding terminus of natural products. When the genes coding for these polypeptides are to be expressed directly in host cells, the translation of the gene into the polypeptide usually takes place first at the start codon ATG, so that the polypeptide expressed has a formylmethionine residue at its N terminus. Natural polypeptides are not very likely to have formylmethionine at the N terminus, and accordingly, this method is not usable for preparing polypeptides having other N terminus.The formylmethionine residue can be removed from the polypeptide by a chemical reaction using cyanogen bromide, but when the polypeptide has other methionine residues at positions other than the N terminus, the polypeptide chain itself is cut at the position when the above method is resorted to. It is therefore impossible to obtain the desired polypeptide. A method is also known in which the gene coding for the desired polypeptide is linked with the gene coding for some other polypeptide to express a fused polypeptide. With this method, the fusion polypeptide obtained should be treated with enzymes such as trypsin or chemically treated using cyanogen bromide to separate the desired polypeptide from the fused product. Nevertheless, if the desired polypeptide chain includes amino acid sequence which is a target for the enzyme or chemical used, the peptide chain is cut at the position of the amino acid sequence with the result that the method fails to afford the desired polypeptide.Even if the desired polypeptide can be separated from the fused polypeptide by the above method, the isolation of the desired polypeptide usually requires two purification steps, i.e., the step of separating the fused polypeptide from the resulting crude cell extract and the step of separating the desired polypeptide from the reaction mixture containing the separated fused polypeptide. These steps need cumbersome procedures and invariably result in a low yield. Thus, the conventional genetic engineering methods encounter great difficulties in preparing polypeptides which are exactly identical with natural products. It is desired in the art to carry out research on and develop improved methods by which polypeptides which are exactly identical with those of natural origin can be prepared directly from host cells. An object of the present invention is to provide an improved process, as desired in the art, for directly producing from host cells a polypeptide which is exactly identical with the natural one. Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel vector and a microorganism having the vector, for practicing this process. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a vector for expression and secretion of a polypeptide by directly joining a DNA sequence coding for a signal peptide to aDNA sequence coding for the desired polypeptide, the vector being characterized in that it contains the DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide, the vector containing a DNA sequence coding for a fused polypeptide comprising the DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide and the DNA sequence coding for the desired polypeptide directly joined thereto, a microorganism transformed by the vector, and a process for producing the polypeptide by growing the microorganism and collecting the polypeptide secreted therefrom. The symbols as used herein for amino acids, nucleotides and the like are those stipulated by IUPAC orIUB or those conventional in the art, as exemplified below. Ser serine Leu leucine Arg arginine Cys cysteine Gln glutamine Ile isoleucine Pro proline Val valine His histidine Met methionine Ala alanine Phe phenylalanine Gly glycine Asp aspartic acid Asn asparagine A adenine T thymine G guanine C cytosine The term 1 signal peptide1 refers to an amino acid sequence which acts to secrete a polypeptide produced within the cell. The polypeptides produced by all cells which are not limited to the cells of microorganisms include those remaining within the cell to perform the contemplated function and those secreted from the cell.In general, the polypeptide to be secreted from the cell is first produced within the cell in the form of a precursor which possesses a signal peptide as an Nterminal extension of more than ten to several tens of amino acid residues. The precursor then passes through the cell membrane by the aid of its signal peptide, whereupon the signal peptide is cleaved by signal peptidase, with the result that only the polypeptide free from any unnecessary amino acid residues is secreted from the cell. The polypeptide thus screted from the cell will hereinafter be referred to as mature poly peptide. For example, E.coli ss lactamase is first produced within the cell as pre 8 lactamase, i.e. a precursor of B lactamase with N terminal extension of 23 amino acid residues as a signal peptide.By the aid of the signal peptide, the protein is passed through the inner membrane and secreted into the periplasm, i.e. the space between the inner membrane and the outer membrane.At this time, the signal peptide is cleaved by signal peptidase, permitting a mature polypeptide, namely active form of 6 lactamase, to be accumulated in the periplasm as is already known J.G. Sutcliffe, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.,U.S.A., 75, 3737 3741 1978 . Directing attention to the characteristics of the signal peptide, we have carried out intensive research based on the concept that when host cells are caused to produce the desired foreign protein as a fused polypeptide having a signal peptide at its N terminus, the foreign protein can be secreted from the cells as a mature polypeptide, whereby the desired polypeptide can be produced easily. Consequently, we have succeeded in providing a novel vector plasmid which, when introduced into a host cell, actually causes the cell to secrete the desired polypeptide as a mature polypeptide, that is, a vector for expression and secretion of the polypeptide. We have also succeeded in producing the desired polypeptide using the vector. The vector of the present invention for expression and secretion of the desired polypeptide harbors a DNA sequence coding for a signal peptide which is so designed as to have directly joined thereto a DNA sequence coding for the desired polypeptide. Accordingly, the DNA sequence coding for the desired polypeptide can be directly joined to the DNA sequence of the vector coding for the signal peptide. The expression vector thus obtained is introduced into host cells, which are then grown, whereby the desired polypeptide can be secreted or produced as a mature polypeptide outside the cells or in the periplasm. The techinque for producing the vector of the invention will be described in detail below. The DNA sequence coding for a signal peptide which is an essential constituent of the vector of the present invention can be any of those heretofore known and coding for signal peptides. Typical of such signal peptides is, for example, the one for the 6 lactamase ofE.coli. This signal peptide has the amino acid sequence of the formula 1 below. Met Ser Ile Gln His Phe Arg Val Ala Leu Ile Pro Phe Phe Ala Ala Phe Cys Leu Pro Val Phe Ala 1 The DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide can be optionally designed because anyone of the degenerated codons for each amino acid shown below is allowable for the sequence, Each of the nucleotides may be modified by methylation or the like. Met ATG Ser TCT, TCC, TCA, TCG, AGT, AGC Ile TTT, ATC, ATA Gln CAA, CAG His CAT, CAC Phe TTT, TTC Arg AGA, AGG, CGT, CGC, CGA, CGG Val GTT, GTC, GTA, GTG Ala GCT, GCC, GCA, GCG Leu TTA, TTG, CTT, CTC, CTA, CTG Pro CCT, CCC, CCA, CCG Cys TGT, TGC An example of especially preferred combination selected from these codons is the one represented by the formula 2 below. ATGAGTATTCAACATTTCCGTGTC GCCCTTATTCCCTTTTTTGCGGCC TTTTGCCTTCCTGTCTTCGCG 2 The DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide and possessed by the vector of the present invention basically comprises such a specific DNA sequence as exemplified above and further includes restriction endonuclease recognition sequences in the vicinity of the 3 end thereof to which a DNA sequence coding for the contemplated polypeptide is to be joined, preferably within 10 base sequence from the end, or in the DNA sequence of up to 10 bases added to the 3 end. This is essentially required for directly joining the DNA sequence coding for the desired polypeptide to the DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide.While any of the known restriction endonuclease is useful as the enzyme for recognizing the restriction endonuclease recognition sequence, preferable are those recognizing a sequence of not smaller than five bases. The DNA sequence in the vicinity of the 3 end can be altered as desired depending on the enzyme to be used. This will be described in greater detail with reference, for example, to the signal peptide for ss lactamase exemplified above. When GCC is selected as the codon for the amino acid Ala at the C terminus, the threebase sequence GGC may be linked to this sequence. The six base sequence GCCGGC is thus formed and it can be recognized by the restriction endonuclease NaeI. The DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide is cleaved at the center of the above sequence by NaeI, whereby a DNA is obtained wherein the 3 end is GCC corresponding to the amino acid Ala at the C end of the signal peptide . The desired DNA sequence coding for the contemplated polypeptide can be directly linked to this DNA immediately thereafter. When TTCGCG, for example, is selected as the codons for the two amino acid sequence Phe Ala at the C terminus of the signal peptide, the seven base sequence TTCGCGA can be obtained by adding adenine A to the 3 end. TCGCGA included in this sequence can be recognized and cleaved at the center by the restriction endonucleaseNruI, giving a DNA sequence having TTCG at its 3 end.When this sequence is used in the DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide, the DNA sequence obtained by the digestion with NruI of the above DNA sequence can be linked to the DNA sequence coding for the desired polypeptie with additional two bases, CT, CC, CA or CG, to the 5 end, whereby a DNA sequence is obtained which codes for the desired fused polypeptide. Further if the ten base sequence AACTCAGCTG, for example, is linked to the 3 end of the DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide, the six base sequenceCAGCTG included in the linked sequence can be recognized and cleaved at the center by PvuII, giving a DNA sequence which includes the DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide and additional seven base sequence AACTCAG attached to the 3 end thereof. In this seven base sequence, the first three base sequence AAC codes for Asn, the next three base sequence TCA codes for Ser, and the last base guanine G can be the first base of codons forAla, Gly, Val, Asp or Gln.Accordingly, the sequence obtained by the digestion with NruI of the above DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide, can be linked to the DNA sequence coding for a polypeptide, such as ss urogastrone, having the amino acid sequence Asn Ser Asp at the N terminus, when the seven base sequence e.g.AACTCAG at the 5 end is removed from the latter sequence, whereby a DNA sequence can be readily obtained which codes for the desired fused polypeptide of the signal peptide and a urogastrone . In addition to the DNA sequence specifically exemplified above as the DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide as a component of the vector of the present invention, another preferred example that is usable is a sequence obtained by adding a DNA sequence of up to ten bases to the above sequence. The formula 3 below represents such an example of DNA sequence having the above mentioned ten additonal bases. ATGAGTATTCAACATTTCCGTGTC GCCCTTATTCCCTTTTTTGCGGCC TTTTGCCTTCCTGTCTTCGCGAAC TCAGCTG 3 The DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide of the present invention or DNA sequences including the sequence can be readily produced by various known methods, tor example, by a method of cutting off and isolating the sequence from the DNA of microorganisms or plasmids or the like isolated thereof, e.g. preferably pBR322 or the like, using restriction endonuclease, by a method of chemically synthesizing the DNA sequence, or by the combination of such methods. The DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide can be linked or attached to the DNA sequence coding for the desired polypeptide also by various known methods, for example, by an enzymatic reaction using T11 DNA ligase or the like. The vector of the present invention containing the DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide thus obtained can be prepared by incorporating the DNA sequence into various vectors heretofore used for cloning foreign genes, such as plasmids, viral DNA and cosmids e.g. pJB8,Ish Horowicz, D. and Burke, J.F., Nucleic Acids Res., 9, 2989 1981 . Examples of suitable vectors for incorporating the DNA sequence include the above mentioned plasmid pBR322 and the following. The plasmid pTUB4 signal peptide of Bacillus subtilis a amylase, H. Yamazaki et al., J. Bacteriol., 156, 327 337 1983 . The plsmid pHC5 signal peptide of E. coli maltose binding protein, H. Bedouelle et al., Nature, 285, 78 81 1980 . The plasmid pSN518 signal peptide of E. coli phosphate binding protein, K. Magota et al., J.Bacteriol., 157, 909 917 1984 . The plasmid pJP12 signal peptide of E. coli outer membrane pore protein which is included by phosphate limitation, N. Overbeeke et al., J. Mol. Biol., 163, 513532 1983 . The DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide can be introduced into the origin vector by the same procedure as conventionally used for incorporating such foreign genes into vectors, as already exemplified. The polypeptide secretion vector of the invention thus obtained and containing the DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide of course needs to have incorporated therein the DNA sequence coding for the desired polypeptide before being actually introduced into host cells for the expression and secretion of the desired polypeptide. In addition, the vector must contain a promoter, a ribosome binding site, a stop codon and the other regulatory DNA sequences such as terminater. In some cases, the original vector contains such factors. In such a case, the regulatory factors for expression of ss lactamase derived from the origin vector pBR322, for example, are usable as such. However, this is not a limitative example various DNAs derived from other known microorganisms or viruses also usually contain these regulatory factors, which are therefore usable.Examples of useful factors are promoters such as those of E. coli lactose operon, tryptophan operon and A phage PL, ribosome binding sites such as SD sequence of B galactosidase, and terminaters such as A phage till. The three base sequences of TAA, TAG and TGA are usable as stop codons. Such regulatory factors can be separated by a usual method from a DNA containing them, and the desired factors can be introduced into a suitable vector by a usual method. Examples of vectors of the present invention having especially preferred regulatory factors and the DNA sequence for signal peptide include pGH54 and pGH55 constructed from the origin vector pBR322. One of the plasmids, pGH5II, has the promoter and ribosome binding site of B lactamase and the subsequent DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide of 6 lactamase. The plasmid has at the 3 end of the DNA sequence the recognition sequences for the restriction endonucleases NruI and PvuII. The characteristics of the plasmid are shown in Fig. 1, which also schematically shows the production procedure therefor. With reference to Fig. 1, pGH54 is characterized by the illustrated restriction endonuclease cleavage map. pGH54 has about 3.9 kb as determined by 1.0 agarose gel electrophoresis. The E. coli strain HB101 harboring the plasmid pGH54 has been deposited with the designation HB101 pGH543 and deposition number FERM BP 679 in Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of IndustrialScience and Technology, MITI. pGH55 is in common with pGH5II in that the plasmid has the promoter and the ribosome binding site of ss lactamase and the subsequent DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide of B lactamase, but is devoid of about 0.64 kb DNA of pGH54 containing a PvuII restriction site and has another PvuII restriction site in the vicinity of the 3 end of the DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide.The characteristics of the plasmid and the outline of production procedure therefor are shown in Fig. 2. With reference to Fig. 2, pGH55 is characterized by the illustrated restriction endonuclease cleavage map and has about 3.3 kb as determined by the same method as above. The E. coli strain HB101 harboring the plasmid pGH55 has been deposited with the designation HB101 pGH55 and deposition number FERM BP 680 in FermentationResearch Institute, Agency of Industrial Science andTechnology, MITI. The vector of the present invention for expression and secretion of the desired polypeptide contains various regulatory factors mentioned above and has the DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide and theDNA sequence directly attached thereto and coding for the desired polypeptide. This vector is constructed in the same manner as the vector of the invention described above. The invention provides this vector for expression and secretion of the desired mature polypeptide. The polypeptide, as well as the DNA sequence thereof, to be contained in the mature polypeptide secretion vector of the present invention, as an DNA sequence attached to the DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide to code for a fused polypeptide can be any of desired polypeptides and DNA sequences coding therefor. Examples of such polypeptides are epidermal growth factor, somatostatin, insulin, GIP, R MSA, thymosin ss4, growth hormone, growth hormone releasing factor and like hormones and growth factors, interferons, interleukin 2, tumor necrosis factor and like lymphokines and immunoregulatory substances, serum albumin, plasminogen activator, apolipoproteins and like blood constituent substances, hepatitis B virus surface antigen and like antigen proteins for vaccines, etc.The DNA sequences coding for these polypeptides may be extracted and isolated from cells or the like containing them by usual methods, or can be chemically synthesized according to the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide concerned.

U.S.A. , 78, 1162 1981 The DNA sequence for the polypeptide can be attached to the DNA sequence for the signal peptide by introducing the former sequence into the polypeptide secretion vector of the invention having the latter sequence, by the foregoing methods, for example, by an enzymatic reaction using restriction endonucleases and an enzymatic reaction using Tq DNA ligase. Alternatively, the DNA base sequence coding for a fused polypeptide of the signal peptide and desired polypeptide is chemically synthesized and then introduced into a vector in the same manner as the introduction of the DNA sequence for signal peptide. In this way, the polypeptide secretion vector of the present invention can be obtained which has the DNA sequence coding for the fused polypeptide. The vector has a promoter and ribosome binding site upstream of the DNA sequence coding for the fused polypeptide, and a stop codon immediately after the DNA sequence of the desired polypeptide constituting the above sequence. When introduced into a suitable host cell, the vector transforms the cell to express and secrete the polypeptide. Plasmid pUG201 is a preferred example of polypeptide secretion vector. pUG201 includes the promoter and ribosome binding site of 13 lactamase, the DNA sequence for signal peptide of 8 lactamase, the DNA sequence for ss urogastrone desired polypeptide and a stop codon therefor as accurately arranged in this order. This sequence is shown in Table 11 in the example to follow.The E. coli strain HB101 harboring the plasmid pUG201 has been deposited with the designation HB101 pUG2O1 and deposition number FERM BP 681 in the Fermentation ResearchInstitute, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology,MITI. The polypeptide secretion vector of the present invention can be introduced into host cells by various known methods. The host cell to be used is not limited specifically but can be any of various known ones. Examples of useful host cells are gram negative bacteria such as E. coli, gram positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, actinomycetes, yeast, etc. Especially preferable among these are the strain HB1Ol and the other strains derived from E. coli K12. These host cells have signal peptidase as one of the machineries for secreting polypeptides such as extracellular proteins and outer membrane proteins which are required for maintaining the normal function of the cell. It is known that there is little or no difference in substrate specificity among the signal peptidases derived from various microorganisms. D. Perlman and H.O. Halvorson, J. Mol. Biol., 167, 391 1983 . The vector can be introduced into host cells, for example, by treating the host cells in an aqueous solution containing calcium chloride at a low temperature, and adding the vector to the solution E. Lederberg, S.and Cohen, J., Bacteriol., 119, 1072 1974 . When the cells thus transformed by the vector of the invention are grown, a fused polypeptide is produced within the cells, and a mature polypeptide is subsequently secreted extracellularly or into the periplasm and accumulated. Stated more specifically, mRNA is first transcribed from the gene on the vector coding for the fused polypeptide by the action of the transcription regulatory factors of the vector and various factors in the host cell. Subsequently the fused polypeptide is produced from the mRNA by the action of the translation regulatory factors and various factors in the host cell and is secreted extracellularly or into the periplasm by the aid of the signal peptide. At the same time, the signal peptide is cleaved from the fused polypeptide by signal peptidase.Consequently, a mature polypeptide which is free from the signal peptide or any other unnecessary amino acid residues is secreted and accumulated extracellularly or into the periplasm. The mature polypeptide thus secreted and accumulated can be separated off and further purified by usual methods. The polypeptide can be separated off from the culture supernatant or from a periplasmic fraction prepared by the osmotic shock method and purified, for example, by a suitable combination of gel filtration, adsorption chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, etc. The desired polypeptide obtained according to the present invention is a secreted product and therefore has the advantage of being easy to separate off and purify. BEST MODE OF PRACTICING THE INVENTION The present invention will be described below in greater detail with reference to the following examples, in which the following methods and procedures were used unless otherwise specified.1. Cleavage of DNA with restriction endonuclease One of the reaction buffers Table 1 prepared by diluting the concentrated buffer with water is admixed with an aqueous solution or buffer solution or pellet ofDNA, a restriction endonuclease is then added to the mixture, and the resulting mixture is allowed to stand in a water bath at 370C for 3 hours for reaction. The standard amount of restriction endonuclease to be used is one unit per microgram of DNA in 10 lll of the reaction mixture.

The culture is added to 80 mg of chloramphenicol and further incubated with shaking at 370C for 12 to 16 hours. The culture is centrifuged 6000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes to collect the cells, which are then washed with 0.85 sodium chloride, suspended in 2.5 ml of solution of 20 sucrose and 50 mM tris HCl pH 8.0 and subsequently ice cooled for 10 minutes with addition of 0.5 ml of 0.25 M tris HCl pH 8.0 containing 1 lysozyme. The mixture is further ice cooled for 10 minutes with addition of 1 ml of 0.25 m EDTA pH 8.0 .Subsequently, 4 ml of solution of 6 mM tris HCl pH 8.0 , 60 mM EDTA and 0.1 Triton X 100 is added to the mixture. The resutling mixture is centrifuged 25000 r.p.m. for 90 minutes to collect the supernatant.A 9.0 g quantity of cesium chloride is dissolved in 8.2 ml of the supernatant, and 0.8 ml of 1 ethidium bromide is further added thereto.

Synthesis of oligonucleotide An oligonucleotide is synthesized by the following solid phase method solid phase phosphotriester method . H. Ito et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 10, 1755 1769 1982 . A resin prepared by aminomethylating 1 crosslinked polystyrene resin S X1 200 to 400 mesh, product ofBIO.RAD Laboratories is first reacted with monosuccinic acid ester of 5 o dimethoxytritylnucleoside to obtain a nucleoside supporting resin. The following procedure is carried out using a DNA synthesizer produced by BachemInc. The above resin 40 mg is placed into a reactor and treated with a solution of 1 M zinc bromide in dichloromethane isopropanol 85 15 to remove the dimethoxytrityl group at the 5 position. Next, a completely protected dinucleotide prepared by the method of C. Broka et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 8, 5461 5471 1980 in the form of a triethylammonium salt 50 mg is added to the resin, and the mixture is subjected to condensation using a condensation agent mesitylene 5nitrotriazole . The above procedure is repeated to successively lengthen the chain and obtain a resin having supported thereon a protected oligonucleotide. In the final condensation step, 25 mg of the triethylammonium fragment is cloned on the vector M13mp8RF product ofPharmacia .The recombinant phage DNA obtained is used to transfect E. coli strain JM107 by the method of Mandel andHiga J. Mol. Biol., 53, 154 1970 . To 0.2 ml of the resulting cell suspension are added 25 lll of 25 mg ml isopropyl B D thiogalactoside and 40 lll of 20 mg ml 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl ss D galactoside. The suspension is then added to 3 ml of H top agar solution 1 bacto trypton, 0.8 sodium chloride and 0.5 agar solubilized and maintained at 500C.The mixture is spread over a plate of 2xTY medium 1.6 bacto trypton, 1 yeast extract and 0.5 sodium chloride solidified by addition of 1.5 agar and incubated overnight at 370C. The recombinant phage having the DNA fragment inserted therein produces a colorless plaque, whereas the parent strain M13mp8 produces a blue plaque. The desired recombinant phage is therefore easily selectable. One of the colorless plaques is collected by aPasteur pipette and added to 1 ml of 2xTY medium along with 0.01 ml of culture of JM103 strain, followed by incubation with shaking at 370C for about 5 hours to proliferate the recombinant phage. The resulting culture is centrifuged to remove the cell, 0.2 ml of 20 polyethylene glycol 6000 is admixed with the supernatant, and the mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for at least 15 minutes and thereafter centrifuged. The phage sediment is collected, from which a single stranded DNA is extracted using phenol. The extract is used as a template single stranded DNA. The template single stranded DNA and a primer M13 15 base primer, product of Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. , each in an amount of 0.5 pmol, are mixed together, heated at 600C for 20 minutes and then slowly cooled. To the mixture are then added 2 ul of a32Pj dCTP 400 Ci mmol, product of Pharmacia and 2 units of DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment, product of Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. .After thoroughly stirring the mixture, 3.2 lll portions thereof are placed into reaction tubes containing four kinds of dNTP ddNTP mixtures listed in Table 2 individually in an amount of 2 lull. Each of the mixtures is reacted at room temperature for 20 minutes, and further reacted for 20 minutes with addition of chase reaction solution 1 mM of each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP . To the reaction mixture is added 6 ijl of formamide stop solution 95 v v formamide, 0.1 xylene cyanol and 0.1 bromophenol blue . The mixture is heated at 950C for 3 minutes and then rapidly cooled.Subsequently, a 2 lll portion of the sample is electrophoresised on 6 or 8 polyacrylamide gel 1800 V, 30 mA, 2 3 hours , and the gel is transferred to filter paper Whatman 3MM , dried in a dryer and autoradiographed to read to DNA sequence.

HB101 strain derived from E.coli K 1 2 was transformed with the resulting reaction mixture. The desired plasmid pGH53 was isolated from one clone selected from among the tetracycline resistant transformants obtained. Fig. 1 schematically shows the series of steps. Fig. 1 shows the process for preparing the plasmid pGH53 by insertion of the synthetic oligonucleotides 1 , 2 , 3 and 11 in the origin vector pBR322, and also the characteristics of pGH53. The rectangular block shown represents the DNA sequence originated from the synthetic oligonucleotides. The plasmid pGH53 obtained was found to have a size of 4.3 kb by 1.0 agarose gel electrophoresis.Analysis by the M13 method revealed that the DNA sequence of the plasmid was devoid of the sequence between PstI andPvuI restriction sites of pBR322 and had, in place of this sequence, the oligonucleotides 1 , 2 , 3 and 11 inserted as shown below. EMI37.1 The plasmid pGH53 has been deposited with the designation HB101 pGH53 and deposition number FERM BP678 in Fermentation Research Institute, Agency ofIndustrial Science and Technology, MITI. B Construction of mature polypeptide secretion vector pGH511 1 Ten ug of plasmid pGH53 obtained in A was digested in the medium salt buffer using the restriction endonucleases NaeI product of New England Biolabs andAvaI product of Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. . The fragments were electrophoresised on 1.0 agarose gel to isolate aDNA fragment A of about 2.22 kb. The fragment contains a major portion of the DNA sequence derived from the synthetic oligonucleotides and the replication origin of the plasmid. 2 Plasmid pBR322 was digested in the medium salt buffer using the restriction endonucleases AvaI andHindIII products of Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. . The fragments were electrophoresised on 1.0 agarose gel to obtain a DNA fragment B of about 1.40 kb. The fragment contains part of the promoter and the whole structural gene of tetracycline resistance gene. 3 Twenty ijg of plasmid pBR322 was digested in the low salt buffer using the restriction endonuclease Fnu4HI product of New English Biolabs . Subsequently, the cohesive ends of the DNA fragments were removed with S1 nuclease, by dissolving the DNA, after phenol extraction, in 1 ml of buffer pH 4.5 containing 6 mM sodium acetate, 110 mM sodium chloride and 1 mM zinc sulfate, adding 2,000 units of S1 nuclease product of Bethesda ResearchLaboratoriesj and incubating the mixture at 200C for 30 minutes. Next, the DNA, after phenol extraction, was digested in the medium salt buffer using the restriction endonuclease HindIII, followed by 6 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to obtain a DNA fragment C of about 0.28 kb. The fragment contains the promoter and ribosome binding site of B lactamase, part of a gene coding for the signal peptide thereof, and part of the promoter of a tetracycline resistant gene. 4 The three fragments A , B and C obtained were ligated using T11 DNA ligase. HB101 strain was transformed with the resulting reaction mixture. The desired plasmid pGH54 was isolated from one clone selected from among the tetracycline resistant transformants obtained. The DNA sequence analysis of pGH54 by the M13 method revealed that the plasmid had the promoter and ribosome binding site of 8 lactamase, a DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide thereof, and restriction sites for NruI and PvuII upstream and downstream from the 3 end of this sequence, respectively. Fig. 2 schematically shows the series of the foregoing steps. Fig. 2 is a diagram showing the process for preparing the polypeptide secretion vector pGH58 of the present invention from pGH53 and pBR322, and the characteristics of the vector pGH54 obtained. The solid rectangular block shown represents the DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide. As already mentioned, pGH54 has a size of about 3.9 kb and is characterized by the restriction endonuclease map shown in Fig. 2. The DNA sequence analysis by the M13 method revealed that the plasmid had the DNA sequence coding for ss lactamase signal peptide as shown by the formula 3 . C Construction of mature polypeptide secretion vector pGH55 1 The following procedure was executed to prepare pBRH02 which is a derivative of pBR322 lacking a region between the AvaI and PvuII restriction sites. Five vg of pBR322 was digested in the medium salt buffer with the restriction endonucleases AvaI and PvuII product ofTakara Shuzo Co., Ltd. . The fragments were subjected to phenol extraction and then made blunt ended with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment, product of Takara ShuzoCo., Ltd. . The fragments were electrophoresised on 1.0 agarose gel to isolate a DNA fragment of about 3.72 kb, which was then circularized with T11 DNA ligase. HBH101 strain was transformed with the resulting reaction mixture. The desired plasmid pBRH02 was isolated from one clone selected from among the ampicillin and tetracycline resistant transformants obtained. Unlike pBR322, the plasmid pBRH02 obtained was digested neither by AvaI nor by PvuII. 2 Five ug of pBRH02 obtained by the procedure 1 was digested in the medium salt buffer using the restriction endonucleases PstI and BamHI products ofTakara Shuzo Co., Ltd. . The fragments were then electrophoresised on 1.0 agarose gel to isolate a DNA fragment D of about 2.60 kb. The fragment contains part of a tetracyclineresistant gene and the replication origin of the plasmid. 3 Ten llg of pGH54 was digested in the medium salt buffer with the restriction endonucleases PstI and BamHI, and the fragments obtained were electrophoresised on 1.0 agarose gel to isolate a DNA fragment E of about 0.66 kb. The fragment contains the promoter and ribosome binding site of 8 lactamase, part of a DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide thereof and part of a tetracyclineresistant gene. The The two fragments D and E obtained were ligated with T11 DNA ligase. HB101 strain was transformed with the resulting reaction mixture.

HB101 strain was transformed by the resulting reaction mixture. Plasmid was isolated from one clone selected from among the ampicillin resistant transformants obtained. Thus, the plasmid pUG3 was obtained which contained the DNA sequence for ss urogastrone between theEcoRI and the BamHI sites of pBR322. The strain HB101 harboring the plasmid pUG3 has been deposited with the designation HB101 pUG3 and deposition number FERM BP 543. C Construction of pUG201 pUG3 obtained by the process B was digested with the restriction endonuclease HinfI, and the resultingDNA fragment was inserted into pGH55 at the PvuII restriction site thereof to obtain an secretion vector, pUG201, containing a DNA sequence coding for the fused polypeptide of signal peptide and ss urogastrone. This process is as follows. 1 pUG3 15 llg was digested in the high salt buffer with HinfI product of Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. .The fragments were subjected to phenol extraction and made blunt ended with DNA polymerase Klenow fragment .Subsequently, the fragments were electrophoresised on 6 polyacrylamide gel to isolate a DNA fragment F of about 0.43 kb. The fragment was found to contain the DNA sequence inclusive of a stop codon coding for a urogastrone except the seven bases at the 5 end. 2 pGH55 contains a DNA sequence which comprises a sequence coding for the signal peptide of 8 lactamase and the following seven base sequence coding for the Nterminal region of ss urogastrone and which is so designed as to be cleaved with the restriction endonuclease PvuII immediately after the seven base sequence. Five llg of pGH55 was digested in the medium salt buffer with PvuII to obtain a DNA fragment G of about 3.26 kb. The fragment has all genetic information of pGH55. 3 About one llg of fragment F obtained by the step 1 was ligated to about 0.5 ug of fragment G obtained by the step 2 with Tq DNA ligase. HB101 strain was transformed with the resulting reaction mixture. The desired plasmid pUG201 was isolated from one strain selected from among the tetracycline resistant transformants obtained. Fig. 4 schematically shows the series of steps. Fig. 4 is a diagram showing the process for preparing pUG201 from pGH55 and pUG3. pUG201 is the polypeptide secretion vector of the present invention which contains a DNA sequence coding for the fused polypeptide of signal peptide and desired polypeptide ss urogastrone . The blank arrow shown represents the gene of 13 urogastrone. pUG201 was found to have a size of about 3.7 kb by 1.0 agarose gel electrophoresis. When cleaved withBamHI or Hind III, the vector provides two kinds of DNA fragments. This indicates that pUG201 contains the gene of ss urogastrone. The size of the fragments checked shows that pUG201 is the desired plasmid. The part of the DNA sequence of pUG201 from the promoter region of ss lactamase to the ss urogastrone gene inclusive was analysed by theM13 method. Table 4 below shows the DNA sequence identified, indicating that pUG201 contains the promoter, ribosome binding site, DNA sequence coding for ss lactamase signal peptide and for g urogastrone DNA sequence coding for the fused polypeptide as arranged accurately in this order. Table 4 also shows the amino acid sequence corresponding to the DNA sequence. The E. coli strain HB101 harboring pUG201 has been deposited with the designation HB101 pGH201 and deposition number FERM BP 681 in Fermentation ResearchInstitute, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology,MITI.

B Extraction of periplasmic fraction and cytoplasmic fraction from cells The culture obtained by the procedure A was centrifuged 6000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes to collect the cells, which were washed with a buffer 10 mM tris HCl and 30 mM sodium chloride, pH 8.0 in 0.5 times the amount of the culture. A periplasmic fraction was extracted from the washed cells by the osmotic shock method H.C. Neu andL.A. Heppel, J. B. C., 240, 3685 3692 1965 . For the extraction, one g of wet cells were suspended in 80 ml of 30 mM tris HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing 20 sucrose.With addition of 0.32 ml of 0.25 M EDTA pH 8.0 , the suspension was agitated in a rotary shaker at 24 C and 180 r.p.m. for 10 minutes and then centrifuged 9000 r.p.m.for 10 minutes to collect the cells. Subsequently, the cells were resuspended in 80 ml of water cooled with ice. The suspension was allowed to stand in ice for 10 minutes with occasional stirring and centrifuged 9000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes to obtain a supernatant separated from the cells. The supernatant obtained is the periplasmic fraction. The cells separated from the periplasmic fraction was washed with the same washing buffer as above and then suspended in 6 ml of PBS 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 containing 150 mM sodium chloride . The suspension was treated by a sonicator Model 5202, product of Ohtake Works Co., Ltd. at an output of 100 W three times, for 30 seconds each time, and centrifuged 18000 r.p.m. for 20 minutes to obtain a supernatant, which was a cytoplasmic fraction. C Determination of ss urogastrone by radioimmunoassay The fractions obtained by the procedure B were checked for the presence of 8 urogastrone by 8 urogastrone specific radioimmunoassay. The assay was conducted by the following method. Rabbits were itr unized with purified human ss urogastrone as an antigen to obtain antiserum.The S urogastrone 300 pg was dissolved in 0.2 ml of distilled water, 1.5 ml of 50 polyvinylpyrrolidone was added to the solution, and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature. Complete Freund s adjuvant 2.0 ml was added to the mixture to obtain an emulsion, which was subcutaneously injected into the chest portion of three rabbits. After repeating the immunization four times every two weeks, 50 ug of the antigen was further intravenously injected, the whole blood was collected 3 days thereafter, and the serum was separated. Next, the following assay conditions were determined in view of the titration curve for determining the dilution degree of the antiserum for the assay, incubation time for optimizing the assay conditions, method of separating the antibody bound labeled antigen bound from the free labeled antigen free , and etc. The diluting solution used was a 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 0.5 of bovine serum albumin BSA , 140 mM sodium chloride and 25 mM disodium EDTA.The diluting solution 1100 l , 100 iil of the sample or standard human urogastrone and 100 ul of antihuman ss urogastrone serum were mixed together. After the mixture was incubated for 24 hours at 110C, 100 l of 125I labeled human ss urogastrone solution about 5000 cpm was added to the mixture. After the mixture was further incubated for 48 hours at 40C, 100 l of second antibody antirabbit Yglobulin goat serum, 1 20 , 100 l of normal rabbit serum 1 200 and 900 ill of 10 mM PBS buffer containing 5 polyethylene glycol were added to the resulting mixutre, followed by incubation at 4 C for 3 hours. The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m. for 30 minutes, the supernatant was separated off, and the precipitate was counted. The content of immunoreactive substance as human S urogastrone in the sample was determined from the standard curve obtained with use of standard human ss urogastrone. The results are shown in Table 5. Also shown inTable 5 are the results achieved by HB101 transformants incorporating pGH55 or pUG3 and similarly prepared.

The result obtained by growing the microorganism transformed by the vector of the present invention indicates that the 8 urogastrone immunoreactive substance is almost entirely 99.8 distributed in the periplasm.This shows that S urogastrone is secreted into the periplasm through the cell membrane according to the present invention utilizing the DNA sequence of the fused polypeptide of signal peptide and ss urogastrone. D Purification of polypeptide The ss urogastrone immunoreactive substance in the periplasmic extract was purified until a single polypeptide was obtained, by adsorption chromatography using Butyl Toyopearl product of Toyo Soda Mfg. Co.,Ltd. , ion exchange chromatography using CM Toyopearl product of Toyo Soda Mfg. Co., Ltd. or high performance liquid chromatography using a PepRPC column product ofPharmacia . The polypeptide purified was found to be identical with the purified S urogastrone isolated from human urine, by all the results of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, amino acid analysis and N terminal analysis.
