# A plug valve.

## Abstract
A plug valve comprises a plug 10 rotatable in a body 16 of plastics. The plug 10 fits closely within a thin walled metal can 30 . The valve body 16 is formed by moulding around the can 30 and plug 14 , the can 30 thereafter remaining fixed within the valve body, while the plug 14 is rotatable in the can 30 . Seals 22 which are also embedded in the valve body during moulding project through the fluid passage openings in the can to engage the surface of the plug. The provision of the can 30 prevents damage to the plug during moulding of the valve body and prevents the plug from being bonded to the valve body, or the valve body shrinking onto the plug.
