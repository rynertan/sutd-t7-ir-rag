# Cufflink.

## Abstract
A cufflink has a decorative portion A separable from and re attachable to a separate link portion 11 . Preferably the attachment takes the form of a spring catch 3 acting on an engagement head 12 on the link portion 11 . This detacha bility allows the cufflink to be fitted to a cuff easily. The link portion 11 is fitted to an engagement portion 10 , which in use engages the other side of the cuff from the decorative portion 4 . This engagement portion 12 extends to cover a cuff button P if there is one adjacent the button hole on the cuff in use. In this way the cufflink can be used with a convert ible cuff without allowing the ugly co appearance of the engagement portion and the cuff button. Preferably the inner side of the engagement portion 10 has a recess 10a to house the button. The outer surface of the engagement por tion 10 may be decorated.
