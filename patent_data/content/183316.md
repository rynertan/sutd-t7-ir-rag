# Absorption resorption heat pump.

## Abstract
An absorption resorption heat pump comprising a first circuit including a desorber 2 and an absorber 1 intercon nected by conduits 3,4 having a heat exchanger 5 provided therein, so that a first circulatory flow of a first system of liquid substances can be maintained by suitable means from the desorber 2 to the absorber 1 via one 4 of the conduits and from the absorber 1 to the desorber 2 via another one 3 of the conduits, and a second circuit including a resorber or condenser 8 and an evaporator 12 likewise interconnected by conduits 9, 13 having a heat exchanger 15 provided therein, so that a second circulatory flow of a second system of essentially similar liquid subst ances can be maintained by suitable means from the evaporator 12 to the resorber or condenser 8 via one 13 of the conduits and from the resorber or condenser 8 to the evaporator 12 via another one 9 of the conduits. The desorber 2 of the first circuit is connected through a conduit 7 for a volatile component of the first system of substances to the resorber or condenser 8 of the second circuit and the evaporator 12 of the second circuit is connected through a conduit 11 for a volatile component of the second system of substances to the absorber 1 of the first circuit. A branch circuit 19 extends from a point in the second circuit to the desorber section 2 of the first circuit. A storage vessel 18 is provided at a point downstream of the heat exchanger 15 in that section of the second circuit where liquid passes from the evaporator 12 to the resorber 8 , which storage vessel 18 includes an overflow mechanism, and the branch conduit 19 is connected to this overflow mechanism.
