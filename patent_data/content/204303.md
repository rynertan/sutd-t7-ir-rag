# HIGH TEMPERATURE TAPERED INLEAD FOR CERAMIC DISCHARGE LAMPS

## Abstract
The present invention provides a ceramic arc tube seal comprising an electrical feed through or conductive inlead for a high intensity discharge lamp having a high pressure gas discharge tube made of polycrystalline aluminum oxide PCA . The conductive inlead is formed in a frusto conical shape such that a mating relationship is created with tapered apertures in the opposed ends of the PCA tube. A seal is provided between the conductive inlead and the PCA tube such that exposure of the sealing frit glass to the inner chamber of the discharge tube and its fill constituents is substantially reduced or ideally prevented. An additional benefit provided by this invention is improved alignment and centering of the electrode that is supported by the conduc tive inlead in the discharge tube.
