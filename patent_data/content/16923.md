# Electrophotographic copier incorporating a border discharge device.

## Abstract
A border discharge device for an electrophotographic copier comprises a row of light emitting diodes 42 to 74 positioned adjacent light channel sections 90 to 93 . The channels 90, 91 and 93 provide edge erase and channel 92 , together with the others, provide inter image erase, the diodes being selectively energised to effect these functions. The channels comprise blocks of trans parent material having reflective upper and lower surfaces to allow propogation of light rays from each diode to the photoconductive imaging element at a plurality of angles of incidence. Thus each channel provides a substantially uniformly illuminated strip area.
