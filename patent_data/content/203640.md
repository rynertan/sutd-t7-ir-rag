A method for determining the moment that a layer 9 of tacky material present on a cleaning member 8 and serving the purpose of removing contaminants, such as paper dust and softened toner material, from a fusing surface 1 , requires to be rejuvenated, characterized in that the light reflection of the layer 9 of tacky material is determined and the moment that the layer requires rejuvenation is determined on the basis of a comparison of the measured light reflection with a reference value.

## Description
This invention relates to a method for determining the moment that a layer of tacky material present on a cleaning member and serving the purpose of removing contaminants, such as paper dust and rests of toner material, from a fusing surface, requires to be rejuvenated. The invention relates also to a device in which this method is effected. The U.S. Patent Specification 4,013,400 describes a device for cleaning a fusing surface, which comprises a cleaning member covered with a layer of tacky material removing contaminants from the fusing surface, and rejuvenators for applying a fresh layer of tacky material onto the cleaning member. The layer of tacky material present on the cleaning member is thereby rejuvenated from time to time. However, the amount of contaminants, consisting of rests of toner material and paper dust, to be removed from the fusing surface per copying cycle, may widely vary, which is conditional on whether the kind of paper used gives off much or less dust. Therefore, periodical rejuvenation of the layer of tacky material has the disadvantage that the moment of rejuvenation may fall too late or too early. If the moment of rejuvenation falls too late, the fusing surface will be contaminated, resulting in deterioration of the copy quality. If the moment of rejuvenation falls too early, the maximum permissible thickness of the layer on the cleaning member will be reached too soon, the life of the cleaning member thus being shortened unnecessarily. According to the invention a method as meant in the preamble is provided, which is characterized in that the light reflection of the layer of tacky material is determined and the moment that rejuvenation is required is determined on the basis of a comparison of the measured light reflection with a reference value. The method according to the invention is effected in a device for cleaning a surface that has been put into contact with softened thermoplastic material, such as toner material, comprising a cleaning member covered with a layer of tacky material removing contaminants from the surface to be cleaned, and rejuvenators for applying a fresh layer of tacky material onto the cleaning member. The device is characterized in that means are provided for measuring the light reflection of the layer of tacky material present on the cleaning member, and in that a comparison device is provided which compares the measured light reflection with a reference value and emits a signal to put the rejuvenators in operation, as soon as the difference between the measured value and the reference value is in a predetermined range. By determining the light reflection of the layer of tacky material and comparing it with a reference value it is possible, according to the invention, to determine to a fair degree of accuracy the moment that a layer of tacky material requires to be rejuvenated. Thus the afore mentioned disadvantages of the known device are avoided. The light reflection of the layer of tacky material is preferably determined by means of a fixed number of measurements at different areas of the surface of the layer of tacky material. The average light reflection so measured is then compared with a reference value. Preferably the average measuring value of the previous series of measurements is used as reference value. As soon as the difference between the measured value and the reference value i.e. the average measuring value of the previous series of measurements does no longer exceed a predetermined small value, this means that the cleaning action of the layer of tacky material is practically exhausted and that the moment the tacky layer requires to be rejuvenated has come. According to another embodiment of the invention the light reflection of a fresh layer of tacky material is selected as reference value. Whenever the measured light reflection of the layer of tacky material differs more than a predetermined value from the reference value, a fresh layer of tacky material will be applied onto the cleaning member, after which the light reflection of the fresh layer applied is used as reference value in the next measuring cycles. The invention will now be further explained with reference to the accompanying Figures The transfer fusing device according to Fig.1 comprises a fuser roll 1, rotatable in the direction indicated by an arrow, which is coated with a layer of silicone rubber and which is heated by a heating element 2 disposed in the roll. A pressure roll 3, likewise coated with silicone rubber, bears against the fuser roll 1. A photoconductive belt 4 is brought by a pressue roll 5 into pressure contact with fuser roll 1. This pressure contact causes an image consisting of toner powder and formed on the photoconductive belt 4 in a conventional way to be transferred onto fuser roll 1. The toner powder softens on the heated fuser roll 1 and in the nip between fuser roll 1 and pressure roll 3 the softened material is transferred, while being fused simultaneously, onto a sheet of receiving paper 6 which is supplied into this nip by conveying means not shown and which may be heated during the conveyance to the nip. A cleaning member, consisting of a freely rotatable metal roll 8 having its surface coated with a layer of tacky material 9, bears against the fuser roll 1, on the side where its surface moves towards the photoconductive belt 4. Roll 8 is driven by the fuser roll 1 and makes approximately 2.5 revolutions per second. By internal heating means not shown roll 8 is heated up to a temperature exceeding the softening temperature of the material the tacky layer 9 consists of. In the vicinity of roll 8 a magnetic roll 10 coated with silicone rubber is disposed, which roll from a powder reservoir 11 that can be closed, can be covered with a layer of thermoplastic, magnetically attractable powder. Preferably the powder has the same composition as the toner powder with which the powder images on the photoconductive belt 4 are formed. By means not shown in Fig.1 the magnetic roll 10 can be brought from the position represented into a position in which it contacts roll 8. The powder layer present on magnetic roll 10 and softened by a heating element 12, is then transferred onto roll 8. A light emitting diode 13 and a phototransistor 14 are fitted above roll 8. The electrical circuit of the device will now be explained with reference to Fig.2. The light emitting diode 13 is connected to a current source 15 supplying a constant and relatively high direct current to obtain a high light output from the diode 13, which is necessary in order that a measurable light reflection is still obtained with a layer 9 of black tacky material. Parallel to the light emitting diode 13 there is a circuit 16 that can be opened and closed by an electronic switch 17. When circuit 16 is closed, diode 13 does not emit light. Switch 17 is controlled by a time circuit 18 in such a way that it is alternately opened and closed for a short period of 13 milliseconds, for example, at a frequency of 10 kHz, for example, and is then kept closed for a longer period of 90 milliseconds, for example. Thus the diode 13 is prevented from being overcharged, while approximately ten measurements a second are carried out. These measurements are effected each time at different areas of the surface of the tacky layer 9. The light emitted by diode 13 is partly reflected diffusely by the surface of the tacky layer 9. The degree of reflection depends on the amount of paper dust absorbed by the tacky layer 9. Part of the light reflected by layer 9 is caught by phototransistor 14. The output signal from phototransistor 14 is supplied to a rectifier 21, via a preamplifier 19 and a band pass filter of 10 kHz with amplifier 20. The output signal from rectifier 21 is supplied to an integrator 22, whose integration time is controlled by a time circuit 18. At the end of every integration period the output signal of integrator 22 is supplied to an anolog digital converter ADC 23. The output signal from the ADC 23 is supplied to a central processing unit 24. The central processing unit 24 adds the measuring results of a plurality, e.g. 100, of successive measurements and, subsequently, compares the final value with the reference value stored in a random access memory RAM 25. This reference value is the final value of a same plurality of previous measurements. The difference between the final value of the last series of measurements and the reference value is than compared with a fixed value likewise being stored in the RAM 25. If the difference is smaller than or equal to the fixed value, this will be an indication that the tacky layer does hardly absorb paper dust any longer and, consequently, needs to be rejuvenated. Subsequently the central processing unit 24 will generate a signal with which the rejuvenators roll 10, stop valve of the powder reservoir and heating element 12 will be put in operation in order to apply a fresh layer of tacky material onto roll 8. During rejuvenation of the tacky layer 9 the measuring device is switched off. If the difference just mentioned is greater than the fixed value, the tacky layer still does absorb sufficient paper dust and rejuvenation of the layer is not yet necessary. After comparing the final value of a series of successive measurements with the reference value, the final value resulting from the last series of measurements is each time stored in the RAM 25 to serve as the new reference value for the following series of measurements. The fixed value stored in the RAM 25, with which the difference between the reference value and the final value of a series of measurements is compared, is determined experimentally by recording in the device in operation the difference between the final values of successive series of measurements, each consisting of 100 measurements, for example, and determining the moment at which the cleaning effect of the tacky layer 9 on roll 8 has become insufficient. Since the fixed value has been stored in a RAM, it can be changed, if necessary, via the operating panel of the copying apparatus, for example in case of switching over to a tacky material of another composition. According to another embodiment of the invention the reflection of a fresh layer of tacky material is selected as reference value. Then, the average value of every series of measurements again, a series of one hunderd measurements, for example is each time compared with this reference value, and as soon as the difference between the two values exceeds an experimentally predetermined value, the central processing unit 24 will generate a signal to put the rejuvenators in operation. After a fresh layer of tacky material is applied to roll 8, the average value of the first series of measurements is stored in the RAM 25 as the new reference value, to replace the previous reference value. If the device according to the invention, as illustrated before, is used in an electrophotographic copying apparatus, rejuvenation of the layer 9 can also be effected by charging one or more successive sections of the photoconductive belt 4 electrostatically, followed by development with toner powder and conveying the toner layer through the transfer fusing device without supplying a sheet of receiving paper, while pressure roll 3 is withdrawn from the fusing roll 1. The toner layer is or layers are then transferred onto the surface of roll 8. It will be evident that the invention is not restricted to the embodiments described and represented, but that numerous modifications may be made within the scope of the claims, particularly with respect to the light emitting and light detecting elements and the associated electrical circuits.
