# A method of making 2,4,5 trichlorophenol.

## Abstract
A method of making 2,4,5 trichlorophenol by chlorinating 2,5 dichlorophenol is characterised by reacting 2,5 dichlorophenol with chlorine in the presence of liquid inert polar aprotic reaction medium such as nitrobenzene or a chlorinated hydrocarbon reaction medium, particularly 1,2 dichloroethane, and preferably a Lewis acid catalyst, particularly aluminium chloride. The product contains a higher ratio of 2,4,5 trichlorophenol to 2,3,6 trichlorophenol than has been obtainable previously.
