# Thermoplastic elastomer composition.

## Abstract
A thermoplastic elastomer composition composed of a partially crosslinked product of a blend consisting mainly of a 80 to 10 parts by weight of a peroxide crosslinkable olefinic copolymer rubber, b 10 to 80 parts by weight of a peroxide crosslinkable polyolefin resin having specific properties and c 50 to 10 parts by weight of a peroxide decomposable poly olefin resin, the total amount of a b c being 100 parts by weight, the crosslinked product is obtained by dynamically heat treating said blend in the presence of d an organic perox ide. The thermoplastic elastomer has excellent film formability, and is useful as a waterproof sheet.
