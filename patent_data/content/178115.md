# Process for the production of heat resistant methacrylic resin.

## Abstract
Improved process for the production of a methacrylic poly mer having excellent heat resistance, which comprises radical polymerizing a monomer or monomer mixture consisting of 80 to 100 by weight of methyl methacrylate and 0 to 20 by weight of a copolymerizable vinyl monomer in the presence of a polymerization initiator and at least one specific chain trans fer agent which is A a 2 mercaptoethyl alkanecarboxylate of the formula R O CH₂ CH₂SH 1 wherein R is an alkyl group having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, or B an alkyl 3 mercaptopropionate of the formula R O CH₂ CH₂SH 2 wherein R is an alkyl group having from 4 to 18 carbon atoms. The methacrylic resin prepared by this invention has excellent heat resistance and can provide formed products having ex cellent heat resistance high heat distoration temperature without an increase in monomer content during the processing thereof.
