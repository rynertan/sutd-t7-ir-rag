# Measuring device for the contactless measurement of large thicknesses, for metal materials above the Curie temperature.

## Abstract
The sensor is constituted by a magnetic core with pole pieces and by an electric coil wound on the body of said core. With said coil there are associated a sinusoidal current generator and impedance measurement means. A processor determines the thickness from the measured value of said impedance.
