# Printer with and method for duplex printed sheet output.

## Abstract
Printing apparatus comprises input sheet feed means for feeding sheets from input stackers 14,16 in a first path via paper drum 18 and feed rolls 20 to an electrophotographic imaging apparatus with drum 24 and discharge device 28 to print one side of a sheet and an output sheet feed means to feed the sheet in a second path via sheet feed 29 and fuser station 32 from the imaging apparatus to an output stacker 36 . Duplexing sheet feed means with duplex drum 34 can be selectively actuated to divert the sheet from an intermedi ate point in the second path along a third path via staging drum 40 to an intermediate point in the first path. In the third path the sheet is flipped into the sheet flipper means 38 so that when fed back along the first path by the input sheet feed means via staging drum 40 and feed rolls 20 , the imaging apparatus with drum 24 and discharge device 28 can print an image on the other side of the sheet. The apparatus is designed to accommodate a plurality of different sheet sizes by selective control of pressure and vacuum.
