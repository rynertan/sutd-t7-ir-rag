In the following description the expressions upper , lower , vertical , lateral etc. refer to the directions as seen in the drawings. Throughout the drawings like parts have been designated by the same reference numerals. Referring first to Figure 1, there is illustrated one embodiment of an irrigation apparatus according to the present invention. The irrigation apparatus has a drive or forward unit C housing control equipment and a propulsto.. system Coupled to the forward unit C is a hydrant coupling unit A which travels on top of and is guided by a water supply pipe B.The supply pipe has a plurality of hydrants not shown inFigure 1 spaced at predetermined intervals along its length.When the irrigation apparatus arrives at one of these hydrants it is automatically coupled thereto to receive water under pressure from the supply pipe by the coupling unit A.The forward unit C has a pair of main drive wheels D which are driven by the propulsion system and which run on the ground and a pivot mechanism E which is connected to one end of an irrigation boom F. The pivot mechanism E is such that the weight of one end of the boom F is supported by the forward unit C so that the boom can rotate around the forward unit. Passing through the pivot mechanism E from thv forward unit C to the boom F are hydraulic and or pnerr atic supply lines, water supply lines and electrical supply lines. The other end of the boom F is supported from the ground by a wheel unit K consisting of a pair of legs J each of which carries a wheel L. The wheels L are of a similar construction to the wheels D. Drive means not shown e.g. an hydraulic motor, is provided on the wheel mnit to drive at least one of the wheels L 0The wheel unst K is capable of rotating through 90 between a position in which the wheels L are aligned with the length direction of the boom F when the irrigation apparatus is being moved bodily along the pipe B e.g. between t.ydrants, and a position 0 in which the wheels L are at 90 to the length section of the boom F when the boom is rotated around the forward unit C. The wheel unit K carries a pipe detector not shown to stop rotation of the boom F with its axis aligned with the pipe prior to moving the irrigation apparatus bodily, e.g. between hydrants. The boom F carries a plurality of rotating sprinklers M each irrigating a substanti3lly circular area, a first rotating sprinkler cr jet N and a second rotating sprinkler or jet P at the very end of the boom reroute fron. the forward unit C. Each sprinkler M may be a conventional sprinkler which performs full or part circle rotation. Each of the jets N, P may be a conventional large sprinkler which is set to operate on a part circle. The sprinklers M and the jets N, P are controlled by individual valves to enable irrigation of a desired area. The irrigation apparatus uses an internal combustion or compression ignition engine as its basic power source, this engine being used to produce electrical, pneumatic and or hydraulic power which drives other parts of the apparatus including the propulsion system. However, the irrigation apparatus could have other types of power source e.g. an electric motor or a water turbine driven by water under pressure from the pipe B. The irrigation apparatus described above may be operated in a totally automatic mode n which it is controlled by a programme to irrigate a given drea, the progrome reducing or preventing both underwatering and over .atering of the area. It can also be arranged to become inoperative if the water pressure in tlle pipe B falls below a predetermined value. The irrigation apparatus follows the pipe B laid in a desired path which may be a closed or open path. After one area has been irrigated the irrigation apparatus automatically disconnects from the respective hydrant, moves to the next hydrant and couples thereto and then proceeds to irrigate the adjacent area. Figure 2 illustrates a typical arrangement of the pipe B for a field. It will be seen that the pipe B is in the form of a ring main which itself is supplied with water under pressure from a main G. Along the pipe B there are hydrants H. The pipe B not only provides a water supply to the irrigation apparatus but also guides its movement. In Figure 2 the areas outlined by dotted lines indicate the areas irrigated by the irrigation apparatus from each hydrant. It will be seen that each of these areas is substantially square. Figure 3 illustrates an irrigation pattern covered by the irrigation apparatus from one hydrant. The inner circle S is covered by means of the sprinklers M and the outer circle T by the net N, the jet P being shut off, and thus the conventional circular irrigation pattern is produced. However, the boom F is stopped at each corner, i.e. after the boom has rotated through substantially 900, of the square area to be irrigated, the sprinklers M and the jet N are shut off and the jet P is switched on thus irrigating an area Q and producing an acceptable, in irrigation ter2s, substantially squire irrigation pattern. An alternative irrigation pattern is shown in Figure 4 where only the inner circle S is covered by the sprinklers M and the boom F is stopped at each corner of the square area as before and the jet E is switched on to irrigate an area R. Thus in this alternative the irrigation pattern is substantially square but is smaller in area than the irrigation pattern illustrated inFigure 3. Other irrigation patterns can be produced. For example, as shown in Figure 5, by reciprocating the boom F through 1800, instead of rotating it through 3600, and by suit y controlling the operation of the sprinklers M and the jet N or the jets N, P, a substantially rectangular irrigation pattern can be obtained.An irrigation pattern covering a quadrant can simiiarly be obtained 0 by reciprocating the boom through substantially 90 as shown in Figure 6. The movement of the boom F and the operation of the sprinklers F and the jets N, P to produce the desired irrigation patterns are controlled by the control eqltioment housed in the forward ur.it C. The irrigation pattern used in the irrigation of, for example, a field, is dependent upon the actual shape of the field and the layout of the pipe B. Moreover, it may be desirable to irrigate different areas with different quantities of water, for example, in the case of several crops in the area to be irrigated, this too may be controlled by the forward unit C. The control equipment may be internally programmed so that a given area, for example a field, is irrigated in the desired manner. Alternatively control cams, for example, may be provided at each hydrant, each control cam detenmqning the irrigation pattern etc. required at the respective hydrant The control equip. ent not only controls the operation of the sprinl lers M and the jets N, P to produce predetermined irrigation patterns, but also controls movement of the irrigation apparatus between hydrants. The speed of rotation of the boom F may be controlled electronically by a speed sensor on the wheels L. Thus, for example, the boom F may be rotated at a control speed irrespective of whether the ground to be irrigated is level or not. Figure 16 illustrates schematically one embodiment of electric control circuitry for the irrigation apparatus of Figure 1. A control box 100 receives progrn e instructior. signals from cam selector plates 101, 102 which form part of the p cv mechanism E.The cam selector plates 101, 102 provide, in particular, to the control box signals representative of the position of the boom F relative to the forward unit C and by means of a counter 103, a signal representative of the number of revolutions performed by the boom F. The control box 100 also receives inputs from a plurality of switches 104 activated by a control cm or control cams on the hydrant to determine a predetermined irrigation pattern etc. required in the region of that hydrant. The control box also receives a signal from a pipe detector 105, from sensors 106 which are operative as the coupling unit A is coupled to the hydrant, from control switches 107, 110 which detect the approach of a hydrant so that the control box causes the irrigation apparatus to slow drown and which detects any tilting of. the hydrant, switches 108 which detect the position of the wheels D, L, and a switch 109 which produces signals represer.tative of operation of the sprinklers M and jets N, P. The control box 1GO produces output signals not shown which are fed to control valves, the propulsion system etc. of the irrigation apparatus to control its operation. The irrigation apparatus described above operates as follows.The apparatus follows the pipe B, arrives at a hydrant which is detected by the control switches 107, 110 and automatically connects thereto by means of the hydrant coupling unit A. The wheel 0 unit K rotates until the wheels L are at 90 to the length direction of the boom F and as soon as water pressure is available the boom rotates about the forward unit C and irrigates a desired area with an irrigation pattern determined by the control cam or cams on the hydrant or a progrtme stored within the forward unit. When the boom has completed the required number of revolutions detected by the counter 103 the boom is stopped in line with the pipe detected by the pipe detector 105 and the wheel unit K 0 rotates through 90 so that the wheels L are astride the pipe B and are parallel to the length direction of the boom. The coupling unit A disconnects from the hydrant and the irrigation apparatus proceeds to the next hydrant. 0 To perform a 90 turn Figure 7 , the pipe B is provided ith a relatively short pipe section U between two plpe sections V, V 0 which are at 90 to one another. The pipe section U joins the pipe sections V, V and is at 450 to each. A hydrant H is provided cn the pipe section U. In operation, the irrigation apparatus is moved along the pipe section B and the forward unit C coupled to the hydrantH with the length direction of the boom F substantially, but not exactly, parallel to the pipe section V with the forward unit C substantially at 450 to the boom F.The cam selector plates 101, 102 thus cause the boom F then to perform a predeternined number of revolutions to irrigate the area around the hydrant H and to stop the boom F in a position Y. Thus the length direction of the boom is substantially, but not exactly, parallel to the pipe section V . Thus the irrigation apparatus can move along the pipe section V until it reaches the next hydrant. It will be appreciated that, in this manner, the irrigation apparatus 0 has performed a 90 turn. It has been found that the irrigation apparatus described above can, in this manner 0 negotiate extremely tight 90 corners in the pipe B. The irrigation apparatus illustrated in Figure 1 can, as already described, be used in an automatic mode in which it follows the pipe B from hydrant to hydrant and irrigates a given area at each in accordance with a predetermined programe. It will be appreciated that the areas irrigated at adjacent hydrants may overlap. Alternatively, the irrigation apparatus may be used in a manual mode for movement off the pipe B. To this end, the irrigation apparatus may be manually controlled in one of two ways neither of which is illustrated. The first way is to provide a driving position at or adjacent the forward unit C with a seat, steering wheel and manually operable control console.The second way is to provide a handle adjacent the forward unit C for steering the wheels D and a manually operable control console 12 for use by an operator walking alongside the irrigation apparatus. In either case the manually operable control console is used to steer the wheels L to enable the irrigation apparatus to be manoevered in confined spaces especially when it is desired to change the direction of travel of the irrigation apparatus. Referring now to Figure 8, the coupling unit A is shown in greater detail. The coupling unit A has two pivoted load carrying wheels 10 mounted in trailing configuration and arranged to travel on the upper surface of the pipe B.Each wheel 10 is mounted for rotation in a respective wheel support frame 11 which carries two guide wheels 12 independently spring biased by mean not shown to contact the sides of the pipe B. Each of the frames 11 is mounted for pivotal novement about a vertical axis 13 on a chassis 14.A spring 15, connected between the chassis 14 and each frame 11, biases the latter toward a central position to provide stability and to urge the coupling unit to travel in a straight line nLess it is negotiating a bend in the pipe B. The contact point indicated by line 16 of the guide wheels 12 on each frame 11 with the pipe B is in advance of the axis 13 by a distance E which is equal to a distance q by which the axis indicated by line 17 of rotation of the respective wheel 10 is ih retard of the axis 13.This also increases stability and facilities guiding of the guide wheels 12 on the pipe B. Each wheel 10 is mounted for rotation at one end of a strut 17 forming part of the frame 11. The other end of the strut l7 is pivotally complected to a frame part 18 which itself is pivotally mounted on the chassis 14. A jack 19 is connected at one end to the strut 17 and at the other end to the frane part 18.Thus the wheel 10 may be raised clear of the pipe B by means of the jack 19. Each guide wheel 12 is mounted on a strut 20 connected to the frane part 18. A jack 21 best seen in Figure 9 is connected to the struts 20 to move the guide wheel 12 clear of the pipe B and the wheel 10 as shown in dotted lines in Figure 9.The wheels 10, 12 are, by means of the jacks 19, 21 moved clear of the pipe B when it is desired to move the irrigation apparatus away from the pipe B. A probe housing 22 is fixed to the chassis 14. A strut 23 is pivotally connected at one end by a bearing 24 to the housing 22 and is connected at its other end by a probe tilt slave linkage 25 to a support strut 26. Thus the chassis 14 is capable of pivotillg in the direction indicated by an arrow in Figure 8 about the bearing 24 and also about the linkage 25. A steering head arm 27 is fixed at one end to a steering head 28 forming part of the forward unit C and is mounted for pivotal movement about a bearing 29 on the strut 26. The strut 26 carries a lever 30 the free end of which is connected to the arm 27 by a locking device 31 which may be an hydraulic or pneumatic jack o an electrically operated unit.The locking device 31, when located, maintains the bearing 29 vertically above the bearing 24. and, when unlocked, allows the strut 26 to pivot about the bearing 29 relative to the arm 27 so that limited movement of the chassis 14 in the direction of an arrow r relative to the steering head 28 is possible. The relationship between the axis 13 of the leading guide wheels 12 and the steering head 28 provides a mechanical servo effect which greatly reduces loads imposed on the guide wheels 12 when negotiating sharp bends in the pipe B. The fact that the chassis is capable of pivoting about the bearing 24 allows the wheels 10 to ride over obstacles along the pipe 3 such as, for example, couplings or joints. Moreover, the ability of the chassis 14 to move to a limited extent in the direction of the arrow r enables misalignment o a probe 32 Figures 10 to 12 located within the housing 22 with a hydrant H to be accommodated without having to move the whole of the irrigation apparatus. Referring now to Figure 10, at the lower end of the housing 22, lugs 34 each engage beneath a pair of side plates 35 located on each side of a mouth 33 of the hydrant H to locate the probe laterally and to prevent the probe and hydrant from separating whenwater flows from the latter to the former. On the interior of the housing 22 there are two guide tracks 36 best seen in Figure 11 in each of which runs a pair of spaced apart rollers 37.The rollers 37 at the upper end of the housing 22 are mounted on respective arms 38 which are fixed to the probe 32. Each arm 38 also carries a further roller 39 which runs on a wall 40 of the track 36 to guide the probe laterally. The rollers 37 at the lower end of the housing 22 are mounted on a support member 42 which carries further rollers 43 also for guiding the probe 32 laterally. A jack 41 Figure 12 which may be pneumatic or hydraulic is connected between the support member 42 fixed to the probe 32 ar.d the housing 22 to raise and lower the probe within the housing.A roller 44 is mounted on the support member 42 on each side of the probe 32 to engage a ratp surface 45 on one or other of the side plates 35 of each pair as the probe is lowered. tlhen each roller 44 is positioned in a slot 46 between the respective pair of side plates 35 the probe is correctly located within the mouth 33 of the hydrant. In operation the irrigation apparatus is stopped with the probe 32 substantially above the hydrant and the probe is lowered towards the mouth of the hydrant by the jack 41 with the locking device 31 unlocked. If there is any misolicrment between the prove 32 and the mouth 33 of the hydrant, the rollers 44 will engage ra p surfaces 45 on the respective pairs of side plates 35 and as the probe is lowered further will roll towards the respective slots 46 at the same time moving the chassis 14 in the direction of arrow r. Thus the probe will become precisely aligned with the mouth of the hydrant. Then this has occurred the locking device is locked to prevent further movenent of the chassis 14. The construction of the hydrant is illustrated in Figure 13.In the mouth 33 of the hydrant is a valve plate 47 which is urged into closing contact with a seat 48 by a spring 49. The valve plate 47 has a central valve stem 50 fiend to a flow ring 51 against which bears the upper end of the spring 49. The lower end of the spring 49 bears against a ledge 52 of a housing 53 of the hydrant. As the probe is lowered into the mouth 33 of the hydrant, it engages the flow ring 51 soyas to r,ove the valve plate away from its seat 48 thereby allowing water to pass from the pipe B to the probe. The flow ring 51 has a plurality, e.g. 4, radial vanes 54 which act as flow guides, as guides for movement of the valve stem 50 and to prevent ingress of debris into the mouth 33. The housing 53 of the hydrant has ramp surfaces 55 to assist passage of the wheels 10 over the hydrant. The wheels 10 ride over the surfaces 55 as best seen in Figure 14. Adjacent the surfaces 55 switch or valve operating cans 56 Figure 10 may be provided. These cams cooperate with rollers 57 connected to operate respective programme control switches 58 mounted on the support member 42 as the probe 32 enters the mouth 33 of the hydrant to select the cycle operation of the irrigation apparatus appropriate to that hydrant. A non return plate valve 58 is locate at the upper esd of the probe to reduce the amount of spillage of water when the probe is w thdrawn from the hydrant. ten connected to the hydrant, the pressure of water from the hydrant maintains the valve 58 open but the valve 58 will close as the probe 32 is withdrawn from the hydrant and the flow of water within the probe ceases. The water within the probe 32 may be maintained at an optimum desired pressure regardless of the pressure of water within the pipeB, assuming that the pressure of water within the pipe B is higher than the desired pressure. This is achieved by a pressure sensing device not shown which adjusts the jack 41 and the position of the probe 32, thus varying the position of the valve plate 47 relative to its seat 48. The pressure sensing device may be located to sense water pressure at a desired point or points.Consequently the position of the probe 32 relative to the mouth 33 of the hydrant controls the flow of water through the probe. Figure 15 is a perspective view of a sensing machanism 60 for tilting the probe 32 to align it with a hydrant when the latter is not vertical. The sensing mechanism 60 Comprises two link arms 61 which rotate about a fixed shaft 62. The link arms are connected at their lower ends by a shaft 63 whose.ends are mounted in bearings in a sub frame 64. A pulley wheel 65 is rigidly attached to one of the link arms 61 and operates a flexible cable 66 to transzlt tilting movement of the sensing mechanism 60 to a Slave unit not shown connected, for example, at the lirrkag 25 to cause the probe to perform a corresponding tilting movement.A pair of sensing plates 67 are mounted for pivotal movement on the sub frame 64 and are biased towards each other by a spring not shown . when not in contact with the hydrant the sensing plates 67 are each at an angle of about 100 to the vertical.On contacting a hydrant the sensinq plates move outwardly to a vertical position and, at the same time, operate a switch nGL shown which slows down the rate of travel of the irrigation apparatus having sensed the proximity of the hydrant. The sensing plates sense the degree of relative tilt between the hydrant and the probe and transmits this relative tilt to the slave unit so that the probe tilts to the correct angle for entry into the hydrant. The coupling unit A described above operates as follows.On approach to the hydrant the sensing plates 67 contact the hydrant H and operate the switch which slows down the rate of travel of the irritation apparatus and at the same time the probe is tilted, if necessary, so that there is zero relative tilt between the probe and the hydrant. Thus prior to the probe arriving at a position above the hydrant, it is at the correct angle for entry thereinto. Travel of the irrigation apparatus is stopped with the probe substantially above the mouth 33 of the hydrant upon actuation of a switch not shown carried by the housing 22 by the hydrant. When the irrigation apparatus is stopped, the probe is above the youth of the hydrant within limits determined by the side plates 35.The wheels D are locked to prevent further travel of the irrigation apparatus The jack 41 lowers the probe and when the rollers 44 are just above the ramp surfaces 45 of the side plates 35 the locking device 31 is unlocked permitting the chassis to move in the direction of the arrow r as the rollers 44 run over the ramp surfaces to reach the respective slots 46. Further lowering of the probe causes the valve plate 47 to lift from its seat 48 ar.d water to flow from the hydrant into the probe and thence to the sprinklers M and jets N, P. At the sae time the locking device 31 will lock to prevent relative movement in the direction of arrow r between the chassis 14 and the hydrant. After a predetermined time or quantity of water has flowed through the probe, the jack 41 raises the probe and the irrigation apparatus proceeds to the next hydrant. The initial travel of the irrigation apparatus is at a relatively reduced speed until the trailing wheel 10 has passed over the hydrant. At the same tine the slave unit and linkage 25 return to a datum position. The advantege of irrigation apparatus of the type described above is that by rotating the boom F about the forward unit C at a constant speed the total application of water to a given area is gradually built up. For example, if water equivalent to precipitation of 1.5 mm is applied upon each revolution or pass of the boom, the soil will have up to 30 minutes to take up that water until the boom next applies water.This type of irrigation is very acceptable to even the most delicate soils and crops thrive with a slow build up of water through a plurality of gentle applications.Known systems which apply water equivalent to precipitation of from 12.5 mm upwards to 30 mm each pass have been found to damage soil structure and crops. The facility of being able to apply a given quantity of water to a given area in a given time makes the irrigation apparatus particularly suitable to the application of fertiliser especially if the fertiliser is applied to a previously watered crop. Thus fertiliser car. be metered into the water sprayed from the boom on any desired revolution of the boom, at any hydrant, at any time. The supply of fertiliser is preferably carried by the irrigation apparatus and would be metered by any known metering system. Referring now to Figure 17, there is illustrated another embodiment of an irrigation apparatus according to the present invention which is similar to the irrigation apparatus of Figure 1 except that a coupling Unit A according to the present invention is connected by spherical bearings 200 Figure 18 to the forward unit C which carries circuitry X and a diesel engine hydraulic power unit Y. The coupling unit A shown in Figure 18 is similar to that shown in Figure 8. The bearings 200 provide the strut 26 with the facility to tilt as shorn in Figure 19 and to steer. A bellcrank le ver 201 is pivotally mounted on the strut 26, one end of which is connected by a locking tilting device l99 to the strut 26 and the other end of which is connected via a strut 202 to the chassis 14. The lockingitilting device 199 is controlled by the sensing mechanism 60. Thus when the bell crank lever 201 is pivoted, the strut 26 moves laterally, and the strut 202 ensures that the chassis 14 tilts correspondingly in the lateral direction. The guide wheels 12 are mounted on the irame 11 via rubber springs 203 to provide the required contact pressure with the pipe B. The guide wheels 12 and the rubber springs 203 can be pivoted manually out of contact with the pipe so that the apparatus can travel out of contact with the pipe by means cf the wheels 10. The probe housing 22 is mounted from and capable of longitudinal movement relative to the chassis 14 by means of flexible linkages 204 which may be made, for example, of rubber.The chassis 14 is thus, in this embodiment, incapable of movement relative to the forward, unit C in the longitudinal direction of the pipe B, but is capable of tilting in a plate perpendicular to th2 direction of the pipe. The operation of the coupling unit is similar to that of the coupling unit A illustrated in Figure 8 with the main exception that the probe housing 22 and the chassis 14 are capable of tilting laterally to acco odate relative tilt of the hydrant H and the probe 32 and relative longitudlnal misalign nt between the probe and hydrant is acco sodated by the flexible linkages 204 and not, as in the embodiment illustrated in Figure 8, by longitudinal movement of the chassis 14 relative to the forward unit C. Figure 20 is a schematic view, of a modification of the probe of Figure 10. Two guide rods 205 extend between plates 206, 207 fixed at spaced apart points to the probe 32. The guide rods 205 run in bearing 208. attached to the housing 22. Figure g1 shows a modification of the arrangement shown in Figure 13. In Figure 2 the side plates 35 located on each side of the mouth of the hydrant H to locate the probe 32 laterally and to prevent the probe and hydrant from separating when water flows from the latter to the former are of diffcrent shape to those shown in Figure 13.In place of the r.o return valve 58 of Figure 13, the probe shown in Figure 21 has a spring loaded non return valve 210 similar to that in the hydrant n. The valve 210 is controlled by a hydraulic jack 211. on reaching the hydrant H the probe 32 engages the mouth of the hydrant H and moves the valve plate 47 downwardly so that water flows from the hydrant into the probe 32. This, in turn, opens the valve 2LO, As water pressure builds up in the boom F a pressure switch not shown monitors the pressure therein to activate the hydraulic jack 211 which controls the position of the valve 210 so that the predetermined water pressure exists in thU boom F. EM.en the irrigation apparatus is to be moved to the next hydrant, the valve 210 is closed by the hydraulic jack 211. As the valve 210 closes pressure will increase in the pipe B and this is sensed by a pressure switch 212 which is set to operate at a pressure below the maximum design pressure of the pipe B.If the maximun design pressure is exceeded in the pipe B, the hydraulic jack 211 ceases to close the valve 210 until the pressure in the pipe B falls below the maximum design pressure when the hydraulic jack 211 continues to close the valve 210. then the valve 210 is fully closed a pressure switch 213 operates to cause the probe 32 to be withdrawn from the hydrant.
