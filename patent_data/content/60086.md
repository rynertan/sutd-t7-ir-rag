# Speech recognition system and method.

## Abstract
Speech recognition accuracy is significantly enhanced by employing recognition criteria that involve comparison in blocks 74, 84 , as between spoken command words and stored training words, of both time dependent feature arrays 72,73 and time independent feature vectors 82, 83 . The novel time independent feature vector for any given word consists of a representation of the frequency of occurrence of each particular feature at any of several time slots in the word. The extra information about the word gained by a comparison 84 of its vector with a correspond ing vector of each training word assists in the final decision 90 .
