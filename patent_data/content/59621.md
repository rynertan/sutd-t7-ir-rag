# IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO HYDROPNEUMATIC SUSPENSION UNITS

## Abstract
The present specification relates to a telescopic hydro pneumatic suspension unit comprising a body member 10 connectible to one of the sprung or unsprung masses of a vehicle and provided with an internal hydraulic cylinder 12 wherein a piston 14 is reciprocable, a piston rod 16 connected to the piston 14 being connectible to the other of said masses. Flexible diaphragm means 36,38,D co operate with the body member 10 and said hydraulic cylinder 12 to define hydraulic chamber 40,44 respectively in com munication with the hydraulic cylinder spaces 52,54 in front of and behind said piston 14 , and a pneumatic chamber 42,46 contiguous with each hydraulic chamber 40,44 . The end of the piston rod 16 within the hydraulic cylinder 12 is axially bored to act as a pump chamber 62 which engages over an axially apertured pump rod 64 which is axially secured within the cylinder 12 , and which communicates with said hydraulic chambers 40,44 through suitably arranged pump inlet 2 and delivery valves 68,70 . Thus relative axial movement between the hydraulic piston rod 16 and the pump rod 64 is effective to transfer fluid from one hydraulic chamber 40,44 to another, with consequent effect upon the axial position of the hydraulic piston 14 in its cylinder 12 . With known suspension units of this type accurate machining of virtually all of the respective pump parts, is required and certain complex components are used, the construction being therefore expensive to manufacture. The present invention seeks to overcome the above disadvantages by avoiding unnecessary and unnecessarily complex components and by eliminating close manufactur ing tolerances in some major components. The present invention provides a fluid flow passage in the form of a groove 80 in the outer surface of the pump rod 64 . The groove 80 communicates with the pump chamber 62 in the hydraulic piston rod 16 and co operates at one end with a pump rod seal 76 carried by the hydraulic piston 14 or its piston rod 16 , to permit fluid transfer to the pump chamber 62 from the high pressure end 52 of the hydraulic cylinder in front of the hydraulic piston 14 whenever said pump rod seal 76 is moved by the hydraulic piston 14 to a position wherein said end of groove 80 is opened to said high pressure end 52 of the hydraulic cylinder 12 . Co operation between the groove 80 and the pump rod seal 76 provides a very simple and reliable means of sensing or detecting the axial position of the piston 14 within cylinder 12 and of maintaining the piston 14 substantially in that position by balancing the rates of fluid flow to and from the high pressure end 52 of the cylinder 12 .
