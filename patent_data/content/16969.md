# Light barrier apparatus.

## Abstract
Light barrier apparatus generally features a light trans mitter for projecting light across a region to be monitored to a light receiver. The light transmitter and receiver units can either be separate or can be combined in a single housing and used in conjunction with a retro reflector for returning light from the sender to the receiver. In any of these arrangements the light transmitter and or sender units incorporate photoelectric converter com ponents 11, 12 and optical projection components 13, 14 together with electronic processing elements which enable interruption of the light barrier to be detected. The present arrangement features a housing 17 including at least one sealed chamber 15 15 , 15 containing solely the optical and photoelectric converter elements. These chambres are thus sealed against the ingress of contamina tion and moisture. The remaining elements of the electronic processing circuit are housed separately in a further cham ber 16 . The housing together with the fixed walls 18, 18 , 18 of the sealed chambers 15, 15 , 15 is use fully injection molded in one piece and preferably together with sighting aids 22 .
