1.

## Description
The present invention relates to exothermic compositions comprising iron metals, neutral metal salts, water, and water holding agents, which generate heat by air oxidation of the iron metals, and more particularly to exothermic compositions which are excellent in heat elevation at the initial stage and are improved in handling. Recently, exothermic compositions utilizing heat generated by air oxidation of iron metals have been widely saled as body warmers because they can be readily and safely handled without using fire. Those body warmers are produced by mixing iron metals, nuetral metal salts, water, water holding agents, and the like, and packing the mixture in a bag, and then sealing the bag. As the iron metals, for smoothly proceeding the oxidation reaction there are employed a granular iron and a powdered iron having a large reaction area. Further, reduced iron powders prepared by a reduction method are popularly used. Nevertheless, because the air oxidation of iron is essentially not vigorous, it takes about 3 or 4 hours to reach an equilibrium temperature generaly 50 to 60 C . Particularly in cold region heat generation is inferior at the initial stage, and sometimes heat generation cannot be obtained. As mentioned above, the exothermic compositions utilize heat generation by air oxidation of iron powders. In order to proceed the reaction, water and chlorine ion or sulfate ion. Amount of water is preferably such an amount that sufaces of the iron powders are partially covered with water. When an amount of water is too small, water is consumed for a short time due to evaporation by the heat elevation, which results in termination of the main reaction. When an amount of water is too large, surfaces of the iron powders are wholely covered with water to reduce air permeability, which prevents the iron from air oxidation. For holding a suitable amount of water while maintaining a good air permeability, there have been employed water holding agents such as powders of coconut husk charcoal, wood, silica gel, vermiculite, pearlite, polyurethane foam, asbestos, water absorbing resin, and the like. Since the water holding agents are, as mentioned above, used for holding water which is an essential component for the air oxidation of iron, it is desired that the agents are lighter and cheaper and that an amount of the agents is smaller insofar as the above condition can be obtianed. An object of the present invention is to provide exothermic compositions which are improved in heat elevation at the initial stage. Another object of the present invention is to provide exothermic compositions which have an excellent water holding capacity and are improved in handling. The present invention relates to exothermic compositions comprising iron metals, nuetral metal salts, water and water holding agents, improvements of which comprise that iron powders treated with sulfur containing compounds as the iron metals and that dry powders of mugwort leaves from which veins are removed are used as a part of the water holding agents. According to the present invention, there can be provided exothermic compositions which can fast generate heat at the initial stage and are excellent in water holding capacity and in handling. A time required for reaching an equilibrium temperature can be shortened to 1 2 to 1 10 of the conventionally required time in case of using untreated iron powders. In the present invention, there can be used various sulfur containing compounds for treating the iron powders. From viewpoints of price, comercial availability and handling safety, preferred examples of the sulfur containing compounds are, for instance, simple sulfur inorganic sulfur containing compounds such as sodium salts and ammonium salts of sufuric acid, thiosufuric acid, sulfurous acid or sulfamic acid, and sulfides such as ammonium sulfide, ammonium hydrosulfide or ammonium polysulfide organic sulfur containing compounds such as thioglycollic acid, thiourea and sodium diethyldithiocarbamic acid and mixtures thereof. Among them suflur and nitrogen containing compounds such as ammonium sulfate and ammonium thiosulfate are most preferably employed in view of safety. The treated iron powders in the present invention can be prepared by thermally treating iron powders with the sulfur containing compounds. In case of using solid sulfur containing compounds, the thermal treatment can be carried out by uniformly mixing the iron powder with the sulfur containing compound powder, and then heating the mixture or by preparing a solution of the sulfur containing compound, applying the solution to the iron powder or dipping the iron powder into the solution, drying the solution to uniformly coat the surface of the iron, and then heating or by preparing a solution of the sulfur containing compound, adding the iron powder to the solution, and then heating the iron powder in the solution. In case of using liquid sulfur containing compounds at normal temperature, the thermal treatment can be carried out by applying the liquid compound or a solution thereof to the iron powder and heating. Amount of the sulfur containing compounds to be used varies with kinds of the compounds, particle sizes or kinds of the iron powders, treating temperatures, treating methods and the like, and is generally a small amount. For example, 0.01 to 90 g of ammonium sulfate is used on the basis of 200 g of the iron powder. In case of ammonium thiosulfate and ammonium sulfamate, amounts to be used are 0.005 to 50 g and 0.07 to 80 g, respectively. The treating temperature varies with kinds of the sulfur containing compounds, treating methods and treating time, and is generally 10 minutes to 3 hours at 100 to 450 C. It seems that the surface of the iron powder may be partially converted to iron sulfides by the thermal treatment with the sulfur containing compounds, but it has not yet been clearly studied. As mentioned hereinafter, however, the effects of the invention cannot be obtained when using iron sulfides. As the iron powders to be treated, there can be employed reduced iron powders, iron powders prepared by an atomization method. When a particle size of the iron powder becomes smaller, the time for initial heat elevation becomes shorter. Preferable range of the particle size is 32 meshes pass, most preferably 80 to 145 meshes. Iron powders having a smaller particle size is inferior in handling. Another characteristic feature of the present invention is the use of the dry powder of mugwort leaves from which veins are removed hereinafter referred to as mugwort leaf powder as a part of the water holding agent. The veins of mugwort leaf are used as a material for preparing moxa, and the mugwort leaf powder used in the present invention can be obtained as a waste in preparation of moxa. Accordingly the mugwort leaf powder has been discarded or used as a filler of cattle feed, and thus is very cheap. The mugwort leaf powder can be prepared by solar drying. Since the particle size of the mugwort leaf powder used as cattle feed is too large to uniformly disperse the powder to the other components, however, the powder should be further micronized. Preferred mugwort leaf powder contains a powder of 100 meshes pass in an amount of not less than 30 by weight, hereinafter the same , more preferably 40 to 80 . Exothermic compositions generally contain 40 to 80 parts parts by weight, hereinafter the same of water on the basis of 100 parts of the iron powder. Accordingly the water holding agents are added in an amount which is enough to hold such an amount of water. In order to hold 100 parts of water, about 80 parts of the conventional water holding agent is required. In case of the mugwort leaf powder it is required in a smaller amount of about 60 parts because the mugwort leaf powder has an excellent water holding capacity. The mugwort leaf powder is used in a mixture with other conventional water holding agents such as water absorbing resin powders, vermiculite powders, wood powders, pearlite powders, polyurethane foam powders, silica gel powders, coconut husk charcoal powders and asbestos powders. The other water holding agents may be used in an amount of 45 to 95 of the total amount of the water holding agents. The exothermic compositions of the present invention contain water and neutral metal salts other than the above components, and if necessary, oxidation catalysts. Examples of the neutral metal salts are, for instance, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium sulfate, and the like. In view of price and the like, sodium chloride is preferably employed. As the oxidation catalyst, active carbon powders are preferably employed. The active carbon powder may be used in mixture with the coconut husk charcoal powder. When using untreated iron powders, a gas is yielded. For preventing the gas generation, there has been blended, as gas generation inhibitors, inorganic or organic alkali compounds or alkali weak acid salts such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydrogen carbonate, sodium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, and sodium propionate. When adding such gas generation inhibitors, however, heat generation is reduced. According to the present invention, since the iron powder treated with the sulfur containing compound can reduce the gas generation, the gas generation inhibitors may not be added. It should be noted, however, that the present invention is not restricted within the scope where the inhibitors are not used. According to the present invention, there may be employed usual untreated iron powders together with the iron powder treated with the sulfur containing compound. Ratio of amounts of the usual untreated iron powder to the treated iron powder is 99 1 to 0 100 by weight . When an amount of the treated iron powder is small, since the initial temperature elevation is slow and gas tends to be generated, it is preferable that the gas generation inhibitor is previously added. In the exothermic compositions of the present invention, there are employed 20 to 70 parts of water, 0.1 to 80 parts of the oxidation catalysts, 1 to 20 parts of the neutral metal salts, 1 to 500 parts of the water holding agents, and if necessary 0.1 to 4 parts of the gas generation inhibitors on the basis of 100 parts of the treated iron powders. The usual untreated iron powders may be used in the above mentioned range. In addition, perfumes, moxa and heat accumulating agents may also be added. These components can be mixed by usual mixing methods. All components may be mixed in one step, or a mixture of the mugwort leaf powder and the other water holding agents is prepared, and then is mixed with the other components. The latter method is preferable. In this case, though the cotton like or fibrous moxa is hardly mixed uniformly with the other components, the mugwort leaf powder from which the vein is removed can easily be mixed. The thus prepared exothermic compositions of the present invention have uniformly distributed components and are dry and flowable. The compositions of the invention are useful as exothermic compositions for body warmers. In this use, the compositions are packed into an air permeable inner bag and an air tight outer bag. According to this embodiment, there are advantages that the body warmer can fit a user s body and give a soft warm, because the mugwort leaf powder has an excellent softness which is absent in the conventional water holding agents. Materials of the outer bag are not limited insofar as they are air tight. Laminated films may be employed. Preferred examples of the outer bag are, for instance, film made of OPP, CPP films of nyrons, polyesters and polypropyrenes having a moisture barrier coating of polyvinylidene chloride thereon aluminum foil plastic films having an aluminum deposition layer and the like. The inner bag may be made by usual air permeable materials such as nonwoven fabrics, woven fabrics and papers.

It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the Examples, and various changes and modifications may be made in the invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.

Moreover since the mugwort leaf powder can be dispersed uniformly into the other components and has a good powder flowability, the package operation can be improved, which can save manufacturing cost.
