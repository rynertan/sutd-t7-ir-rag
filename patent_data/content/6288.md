# Process and apparatus for the removal of olefin monomer from olefin polymers.

## Abstract
A solid particulate olefin polymer containing mono mer s dissolved therein is vigorously agitated mechanical ly to raise the temperature of the polymer to at least 90 C. This vigorous agitation is effected in the absence of any purge gas and the unpolymerised olefin monomer desorbed from the polymer by the increase in temperature can readily be recovered and recycled to the polymerisation vessel. The technique can form part of the work up process in which the polymer is removed from the polymerisation vessel and separated from unconverted monomer s prior to isolation. By this technique, propylene is removed from polypropylene without using a purge stream of nitrogen which makes recovery of the propylene difficult and expensive. The tech nique additionally heats up the polymer which can be ad vantageous for subsequent processing. Apparatus for ef fecting the process includes an agitation vessel 15 which is connected, preferably through an intermediate separa tion vessel 10 , to an olefin polymerisation vessel 1 .
