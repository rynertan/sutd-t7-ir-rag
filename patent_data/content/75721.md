# Amalgam carrier.

## Abstract
Present day amalgam carriers include a separate spring member for urging the dispensing lever to its original position after serving to dispense the amalgam or restorative material into a prepared cavity, for example. Fracturing of the spring member occurs periodically and replacement thereof in the carrier, even if replaceable, is a time consuming and frustrating operation and demands signal dexterity. Ther is provided an amalgam carrier wherein the spring and dispensing lever from an unitary member 118 which requires infrequent replacement, if any, when so replaced, or any other replaceable component of the carrier, may be done with comparative ease.
