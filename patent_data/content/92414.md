# Medical material.

## Abstract
A medical material contains heparinized collagen in which heparin is bound to protamine fixed on collagen. Owing to its excellent compatibility with living bodies, and especially its superb antithrombotic property, the medical material can be suitably used as a substitute material for tissue or organs that are brought into direct contact with blood, namely, as artificial blood vessels, artificial valves and patching materials for cardiovascular organs. The above medical material is also suitable as a membrane having anti adhesion effects. The medical material is obtained by immersing and treating a natural or artificial material succesively in an aqueous pro tamine solution, an aqueous glutaraldehyde solution and an aqueous heparin solution.
