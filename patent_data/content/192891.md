# Spherical ball drive mechanism for a direct drive valve.

## Abstract
Spherical ball drive mechanism 1 for directly coupling a rotary force motor 3 to a valve member 4 , includes a spherical bearing assembly at one end of the valve member. The spherical bearing assembly 1 consists of an outer race member 15 having a concave spherical inner bearing surface 16 and a spherical bearing member 18 having a convex spherical outer bearing surface 21 complementary to the concave spherical inner bearing surface of the outer race member and received therein. The outer race member 15 has a longitudinal axis substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the valve member 4 and a transverse center axis t radially offset from the longitudinal axis of the valve member. An eccentric output shaft 2 of the rotary force motor 3 extends substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the valve member 4 for receipt in a longitudinal bore 19 in the spherical bearing member 18 .
