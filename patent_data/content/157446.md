# Method of simultaneously manufacturing semiconductor regions having different dopings.

## Abstract
A method of simultaneously manufacturing semiconductor regions 3A, B, C having different doping concentrations, for example for obtaining semiconductor resistors having different values. Due to difference in the rate of oxidation, oxide edges of different widths can be formed by oxidation of n type silicon regions thus obtained. According to the invention, ion implanta tion or deposition takes place through doping windows 8, 9, 10 , of which the ratio between the window surface area and the surface area to be doped is different. Subsequently, homogene ous doping concentrations are obtained by diffusion.
