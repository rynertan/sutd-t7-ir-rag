# Conveyor line for heavy goods conveying.

## Abstract
A conveyor line with pallets for conveying heavy loads has a guide member 3 with a U shaped cross section in which there runs a conveyor belt 2 , which can be guided rectilinearly or in curves and comprises links of glidable ma terial. Pallets 6 carrying objects are conveyed along the line. The pallets have two guide segments 11 swivelable about vertical axes x x in tandem in the conveying direction and via support rollers 8 said segments bear against sepa rate support members 7 , one on either side of the guide member 3 . The guide segments have glide shoes 20 mounted coaxially with the axes x x for yieldingly engaging against the belt 2 so that the pallet accompanies the belt in its movement. The segments have guide rollers 30 follo wing opposing, parallel walls 4,4 of the U section guide member for positioning the guide segments along the straight and curved portions of the line. The belt is not loaded by the weight of the conveyed load and only by suited com pression force from the guide shoe allowing the pallet to be kept stationary while gliding against the belt without the belt being subjected to excessive tensional load due to large fric tion forces.
