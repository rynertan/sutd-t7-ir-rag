# Position tracking pulse emitter.

## Abstract
A marking pattern 21 is provided on a lead screw 7 in parallel with the thread of the lead screw. A carriage 3 driven along by the lead screw 7 contains a transducer 25 for sensing the marking pattern on the lead screw to produce electrical output signal pulses indicative of incremental displacement of the carriage 3 . A printhead 1 can be mounted on the carriage 3 and the electrical output signal pulses from the transducer 25 used to control printing operations. The marking pattern 21 can be designed to provide control signals for other purposes, for example for controlling start up, running, deceleration and reversal of a motor 9 driving the lead screw 7 .
