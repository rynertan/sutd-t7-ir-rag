# Television line deflection arrangement.

## Abstract
With television displays and especially with such dis plays for colour projection television it is quite possible to obtain a display raster which exhibits distortions on its vertical sides, namely tilt and bow distortions. These may be corrected by the present line deflection arrangement which comprises a line output switching transistor TR1 , a load inductor L1 , an S correction capacitor C1 and the line deflection coil Ly . The series arrangement of a current limiting inductor L2 and diodes D1 and D2 poled in opposite directions is connected in parallel with the deflec tion coil Ly . A resistor R1 and a transistor TR2 are each connected in parallel with diode D1 whilst a variable resistor R2 is connected in parallel with diode D2 . A resistor R3 shunts the base emitter junction of transistor TR2 whilst input terminals 10 and 11 are respectively connected to the base and collector of that transistor. In the absence of a signal at terminals 10 and 11 the circuitry shunting the deflection coils Ly acts as a centring circuit with a static offset current being produced through the deflection coils Ly which produces a static magnetic bias in the direction of line deflection. Transistor TR2 operates in class A and is biased to its mid conduction point so that it effectively provides a given impedance in parallel with resistor R1. To correct the geometric distortion the terminals receive a field frequency signal input which modulates the conduction of transistor TR2 and hence its impedance at field frequency. To correct for tilt distortion this signal is a field frequency sawtooth whilst to correct for bow distortion this signal is a field frequency parabola, a combination of these signals being used to correct for a combination of these distortions. This modulation produces a modulated magnetic bias through the deflection coils Ly .
