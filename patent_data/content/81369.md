## Description
FLEXIBLE MONOFILAMENT SURGICAL SUTURES COMPRISINGPOLY POLYMETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE, ISOPHTHALATE OR CYCLOHEXANE 1,4 DICARBOXYLATE CO DIMERATE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to drawn and oriented surgical filaments and allied surgical products, and more particularly to strong, but flexible monofilament sutures having unique handling and knot tying characteristics.The novel sutures and surgical products of the present invention comprise an oriented copolymer consisting of recurring poly polymethylene terephthalate, isophthalate or cyclohexane l,4 dicarboxylate and poly polymethylene dimerate units.Many natural and synthetic materials are presently used as surgical sutures. These materials may be used as single filament strands, i.e., monofilament sutures, or as multifilament strands in a braided, twisted or other multifilament construction. Natural materials such as silk, cotton, linen, and the like, do not lend themselves to the fabrication of monofilament sutures and are accordingly generally used in one of the multifilament constructions.Certain synthetic materials which are extruded in continuous lengths can be used in monofilament form. Common synthetic monofilament sutures include polypropylene, polyethylene and nylon. Such monofilament sutures are preferred by surgeons for many surgical applications due to their inherent smoothness and noncapillarity to body fluids.Available synthetic monofilament sutures all suffer to a greater or lesser degree from one particular disadvantage, that is relative stiffness. Besides making the material more difficult to handle and use, suture stiffness or low compliance can adversely affect knot tying ability and knot security. It is because of the inherent stiffness of available monofilament sutures that many suture materials are braided or have other multifilament constructions with better handling, flexibility and conformity.Most monofilament sutures of the prior art are also characterized by a low degree of compliance. This makes knot tying difficult and reduces knot security. In addition, the low compliance and limited ductility prevent the suture from giving as a newly sutured wound swells, with the result that the suture may place the wound tissue under greater tension than is desirable, and may even cause some tearing, cutting or necrosis of the tissue.The problems associated with the use of low compliance sutures in certain applications were recognized in U.S.Patent No. 3,454,011, where it was proposed to fabricate a surgical suture composed of Spandex polyurethane. Such sutures, however, were too elastic and did not find general acceptance in the medical profession.Recently issued U.S. Patent No. 4,224,946 describes a monofilament suture with good flexibility and knot strength, which suture is composed of block polyetheresters which contain 1 a polymeric block of polyalkylene ethers and 2 a polymeric block of aromatic dicarboxylic acids or cycloaliphatic acids with short chain aliphatic or cycloaliphatic diols. Similar subject matter is disclosed in Belgian Patent No. 880,486.Copolyesters of aromatic diacids e.g. terephthalic acid and dimer acids of C1 8 unsaturated fatty acids have been known for some time in the technical and patent literature.Hoeschele Angew.Makromol.Chem. 58 59, 229 1977 disclosed the preparation of thermoplastic PBT polybutylene terephthalate dimerate systems for the generation of elastomeric films and molded articles which were largely unoriented. However, no reference was made to the conversion of these copolymers to oriented fibers, which would possess mechanical properties suitable for use as flexible monofilament sutures.According to a number of patents U.S. Patent No.3,390,108 1968 , U.S. Patent No. 3,091,600 1963 andBritish Patent No. 994,441 1965 , PET polyethylene terephthalate copolymers containing small amounts of dimerate moieties were spun into fibers which possessed superior dying properties. In accordance with U.S. PatentNo. 3,649,571, polyethylene terephthalate is rendered dyeable by incorporating therein the product of the reaction of a small amount of dimer acid with the sodium salt of isothionic acid. Since the processes of dye takeup and diffusion during conventional external dyeing, invariably take place in amorphous regions of a polymer, the observed enhancement of dyeability of the modified PET fibers may be attributed to a lowering of crystallinity by the dimerate structure.At the dimerate levels used in these compositions, the mechanical properties of the fibers are far from compatible with those applications which are sought for sutures, for at least their low compliance or high Young s Modulus .In the few instances in which higher concentrations of dimerate were incorporated into PET copolymers BelgiumPatent No. 649,158 1964 , U.S. Patent No. 3,383,343 1968 , and French Patent No. 1,398,551 1965 , the resulting fibers exhibited inferior tensile properties which rendered these products unsuitable as potential suture materials.In view of the above discussion, the prior art holds little promise for the utilization of a polyester dimerate polymer as basis for a suture material. Furthermore, since dimer acids are long chain branched molecules, the findings in the literature were not surprising, as theory and experience in the art of fiber science predict that branching exerts a deleterious effect on the tensile properties of the resulting fibers. The reason for this is a the inability of the branch to confer good tensile properties, which by its very nature can neither be easily oriented along the fiber axis nor contribute to the load bearing capacity of the fiber required to counteract mechanical stresses and b the steric interference posed by the branch to the main chain alignment during fiber orientation.It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel flexible, thermoplastic monofilament suture or ligature of poly polymethylene terephthalate, isophthalate or cyclohexane 1,4 dicarboxylate co dimerate , having a diameter of from about 0.01 to 1.0 mm and possessing unique and desirable physical properties. A further object of the present invention is to provide a filament which suffers practically no losses in physical properties as judged by a comparison of inherent viscosities and tensile strength before and after Co60 sterilization 2.5 megarads . It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a filament which possesses superior thermal oxidative stability as compared with more conventional types of low modulus thermoplastics such as those denoted as polyetheresters this is because of the inherent instability of the latter .Another object is to provide a filament having improved dye retention, when utilizing dispersed type dyes in a typical melt dying process. These and other objects will be made apparent from the ensuing description and claims. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a drawn and oriented, flexible thermoplastic surgical filament, comprising a copolymer consisting essentially of a multiplicity of recurring A Ipoly polymethylene terephthalate, isophthalate or cyclohexane l,4 dicarboxylate andB poly polymethylene dimerate units having the following general formula Z O CH2 nO x AEMI5.1 wherein Z represents a member selected from the group consisting ofEMI5.2 andEMI5.3 n is 4 to 8, x and y are integers, such that the A units comprise 55 to 98 mole percent, and the B units comprise 2 to 45 mole percent of the copolymer, andEMI5.4 denotes a branched hydrocarbon chain containing from 24 to 32 carbon atoms, in which a size 3 0 strand of said filament has the following combination of mechanical properties Knot strength at least about 25,000 psi Tensile strength at least about 30,000 psi Young s modulus less than about 400,000 psi Elongation from about 20 to 80 In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, Z isEMI6.1 and the following discussion will more fully describe such preferred embodiment.The general structure of the copolymer used in forming preferred monofilament sutures of the present invention may be expressed as follows EMI6.2 whereinEMI6.3 denotes a branched hydrocarbon chain containing 32 carbon atoms.The structure belongs to the random copolymer type and x and y are integers, such that the poly polymethylene terephthalate units comprise 80 to 94 mole percent, and the poly polymethylene dimerate units comprise 6 to 20 mole percent of the copolymer and n is 4 to 8 and is preferably 4.The preferred composition range, for fiber formation, is 80 94 mole percent and most preferably 85 90 mole percent of the poly polymethylene terephthalate units.Monofilament sutures of the present invention having a size 3 0 strand are preferably characterized by the following combination of mechanical properties Knot strength 35,000 to 40,000 psi Tensile strength 60,000 to 80,000 psi Young s modulus less than about 150,000 psi Elongation from about 35 to 50 Sutures possessing the above characteristics may be prepared by melt extrusion, forming a continuous filamentary strand, and drawing the extruded filament to obtain the desired suture properties.Monofilament sutures having physical properties in accordance with the present invention are particularly useful in many surgical procedures where the suture is used to close a wound which may be subject to later swelling or change in position. The combination of low Young s modulus and high elongation provides the suture with an appreciable degree of ductility and high compliance under low applied force. As a result, the suture is able to give to accommodate swelling in the wound area. In addition, the ductility and high tensile strength of the suture allow the suture to stretch during knot tie down so that the knot snugs down for improved tying ability and knot security with a more predictable and consistent knot geometry regardless of variations in suture tying technique or tension.Within the scope of the present invention is a filament as described above having a surgical needle attached to at least one end and useful as a surgical suture. Also within the scope of the present invention is such a filament or surgical suture in a sterile condition, and in addition such filament or sterile suture, packaged in a sterile enclosure. Also within the scope of the present invention is a method of closing a wound by approximating and securing the wound tissue with a filament or surgical suture of the present invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTSThe polymers used in the preferred embodiments of the present invention are prepared by the polycondensation of dimethyl terephthalate, dimer acid, or preferably its diisopropyl ester and a polymethylene diol n 4 to 8, and preferably 4 .EMI8.1 tb SEP CH3 SEP O SEP O SEP CH3 tb CH SEP , SEP OOC SEP COOCH, SEP HO CH2 ,0H C SEP II tb CH3OOCCOOCH3 SEP HO CH2 nOH SEP tb SEP CH3 SEP CH3 tb catalyst tb SEP SEP polymer tb stabilizer tb The preferred parent dimer acid of the diisopropyl ester utilized in the polymerizations is derived from high purity oleic acid and is formed by a clay catalyzed high pressure dimerization of the oleic acid in the presence of water. The mechanism of formation of the dimer acid is probably free radical in nature and the product is believed to consist of a mixture of acyclic unsaturatedC36 acids. The unsaturated materials are then hydrogenated and the dimer ester used in the present polymerizations possesses a slight degree of unsaturation as evidenced by an Iodine number of 5.In addition to theC36 acids that make up the dimer acid there is present some monofunctional acid iso stearic and a certain quantity of trifunctionality in terms of a trimer C54 acid. The former may act as a chain terminator and the latter as crosslinking agent. Detailed structures of theC36 components of the dimer acid have not been elucidated as yet and the diacid is sometimes represented graphically as shown below with four almost equal branches .EMI8.2 The reaction may be run in the absence or preferably in the presence of stabilizers taken from the types of hindered phenols or secondary aromatic amines. An example of the former is Irganox 1098 sold by Ciba Geigy N,N hexamethylene bis 3,5 ditert butyl 4 hydroxy hydrocin namide and an example of the latter is Naugard 445 sold by Uniroyal 4,4 bis a,a dimethylbenzyl diphenyl gamine . Oxides and alkoxides of numerous polyvalent metals may be employed as catalysts. A preferred catalyst for the polymerization is a mixture of 0.1 tetrabutyl orthotitanate and 0.005 magnesium acetate percentages based on total charge weight . If a dyed end product is desired a compatible dye such as, for instance, D Green num 6 can be added in suitable concentrations based on expected polymer yield.The polymerization is run in two stages. In the first stage, run under nitrogen at temperatures ranging from 1600 to 2500C, polycondensation via transesterification and esterification occurs resulting in oligomeric chains. These are converted to materials having a high degree of polymerization in the subsequent step run at 240 to 2550C, at pressures of less than 1 mm of mercury.The resulting polymers exhibit inherent viscosities measured in hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol of 0.6 to 1.3.The Tm of the polymers, depending on composition, varies from 1900 to 2100 C. Apparent viscosities at suitable extrusion temperatures vary from 2x103 to 9x103 poise. A summary of polymer properties is given in Table I.The polymers may readily be extruded in a ram type extruder, such as, an Instron capillary rheometer, at temperatures usually exceeding the polymer Tm by 100 to 500C. The resulting extrudate may be drawn, usually in a two stage process using either two consecutive heated glycerine baths or a hot shoe followed by a subsequent glycerine bath. The draw ratio may vary from about 400 to 700 .The oriented fibers exhibit properties that are quite unexpected. Size 3 0 strands possess knot tensiles in the 35 40x103 psi range, straight tensiles in the 60 80x103 psi range and a Young s modulus of less than 150x103 psi.Elongations range from 35 to 50 .In summary, the polymers described lend themselves to ready extrusion and drawing to strong and supple fibers which are useful as flexible monofilament sutures.A survey of fiber properties is shown in Table II.Both stabilized and unstabilized fibers, upon Co60 sterilization 2.5 megarads suffer practically no losses in physical properties as judged by a comparison of inherent viscosities and tensile strength before and after sterilization. The unexpected retention of physical properties revealed by the unstabilized fibers presents a distinct advantage of the present invention over prior art.General Polymerization ProcedureThe desired amounts of dimethyl terephthalate, diisopropyl dimerate obtained from Emery Industries as Emerest 2349 , a 1.3 to 2.0 molar excess of a polymethylene diol and a given stabilizer are placed under nitrogen into a dry reactor fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a gas inlet tube and a takeoff head for distillation. The system is heated under nitrogen to 1600 and stirring is begun. To the homogeneous stirred solution the required amount of catalyst is added. The mixture is stirred and heated under nitrogen for given time periods at 1900C 2 4 hours and 2200C 1 3 hours . The temperature is subsequently raised to 2500.to 2550C and over a period of 0.4 0.7 hours, the pressure is reduced in the system to below 1 mmJHg preferably in the range of 0.05 mm to 0.1 mm .Stirring and heating under the above conditions is continued to the completion of the polymerization. The endpoint is determined by either a estimating visually the attainment of maximum melt viscosity, b measuring inherent viscosity or melt indices of samples removed from the reaction vessel at intermediate time periods, and c using a calibrated torquemeter immersed into the mixture.In practice, depending on the terephthalate dimerate ratio, in vacuo reaction times vary from 2 to 13 hours.At the end of the polymerization cycle the hot mixture is equilibrated with nitrogen and allowed to cool slowly.The reaction product is isolated, chilled in liquid nitrogen and ground. The ground chips are dried at 80 to 110C for 8 to 16 hours under vacuum of 1 mm or less and subsequently submitted for extrusion.General Extrusion ProcedureExtrusion through the Instron Rheometer is geared towards producing an extrudate which upon drawing 5x to 9x ratio yields a fiber in the 8 10 mil diameter range size 3 0 suture . The polymers are packed at 1100 to 1300C in the extrusion chamber and extruded after a dwell time of 9 to 15 minutes through a 40 mii die. The ram speed is 2 cm minute. Extrusion temperatures depends both on the polymer Tm and on the melt viscosity of the material at a given temperature usually extrusion proceeds at temperatures of 100 to 500C above the Tm. Die swells of up to 408 are experienced but usually are much smaller 5 20 the extrudate is taken up at a speed of 18 feet per minute.General Drawing ProcedureThe extrudate diameter range, 19 22 mm is passed through rollers at an input speed of four feet per minute onto a hot shoe or into a draw bath varied from 500 to 1000C. Draw ratio in this first stage of operation vary from 5x to 6x. The drawn fibers are placed over another set of rollers into a glycerine annealing bath second stage kept at temperatures ranging from 700 to 950 C. Draw ratios for the second stage operation vary from l.lx to 1.25x. Finally, the fiber is passed through a water wash bath and taken up on a spool.In the following examples inherent viscosity ninh is obtained for polymer solutions in hexafluoro 2 propanol HFIP lug. 1 . The infrared spectra are obtained for polymer films cast from CHCl3 or HFIP. The NMR spectra are recorded for polymer samples in solution in 60 40 hexafluoroacetone sesquideuterium oxide. The glass transition Tg , crystallization Tc and melting Tm temperatures of the polymers in nitrogen are recorded, using a D.S.C. differential scanning calorimetry apparatus. The percent crystallinity is determined by Xray. A hot stage microscope is used to determine the melting behaviour of the polymers. Fiber tensile properties are measured on an Instron, Model No. 1122.Steel faced jaws are used throughout. For the measurement of the Young s modulus, line contact jaws are applied.For straight tensile and moduli measurements a speed of 100 mm min., a chart speed of 200 mm min. and a gauge length of 12 cm is employed. For knot tensiles the above parameters are 100 mm min., 100 mm min. and 5 cm, respectively. Example IThe following materials are placed in a nitrogen glove box into a flamed, vacuum dried two necked round bottom flask fitted with a stainless steel paddle shaped stirrer 50.8 g. dimethyl terephthalate 0.2618M 40.2 g. 1,4 butanediol 0.4472M 23.5 g. diisopropyl dimerate Emerest 2349 0.0363M 0.8 g. 4,4 bis a,a dimethylbenzyl diphenylamine 0.24 g. D Green num 6The open neck is fitted with a rubber septum, the flask and stirrer assembly is removed from the glove box, attached to an efficient mechanical stirrer and placed into an oil bath heated at 1600 C. After several minutes, the reaction mixture liquifies and mechanical stirring is started.The catalyst 1.0 ml consisting of 0.1 tetrabutyl orthotitanate and 0.005 magnesium acetate percentages based on total charge weight dissolved in a mixture of methanol and butanol is added through the septum to the reaction via a syringe. The septum is replaced by a short distilling head fitted with a receiver and a nitrogen inlet nozzle. The.reaction mixture is heated under nitrogen at 1900C for 3 hours and at 2200C for 2 hours. As the methanol distillation ceases, the reaction temperature is increased to 2500C, the receiver containing the distillate is replaced by an empty flask and gradually, over a period of 30 minutes, the pressure in the reaction setup is reduced to 0.08 mm. The mixture is heated at this pressure and at 2500C for 4 hours. The hot viscous mass is equilibrated with nitrogen and allowed to cool to room temperature. The polymer is isolated, chilled and then ground. The polymer chips are dried for 8 hours under a good vacuum and a temperature of 800C.Properties of the polymer and of others prepared by similar reaction schemes are shown in Table I see sample num 6 for above described polymer .Example II The procedure of Example I is followed, in all respects with the one exception that a like quantity of dimethyl isophthalate is substituted in place of the dimethyl terephthalate used in the initial reaction mixture. The final product is a poly tetramethylene dimerate coisophthalate polymer.Example IIIThe procedure of Example I is followed in all respects, with the one exception that 52.4 g. of dimethyl cyclohexane 1,4 dicarboxylate is substituted in place of the 50.8 g. of the dimethyl terephthalate used in the initial reaction mixture. The final product is a poly tetramethylene dimerate co cyclohexane l,4dicarboxylate polymer.Example IVTen grams of the copolymer described in Example I are packed at 1500C into the extrusion chamber of an InstronRheometer and after 15 minutes of dwell time the sample is extruded at a ram speed of 2 cm min ., a shear rate of 212.6 sex and a temperature of 2500 C. The resulting melt viscosity is found to be 6178 poise. The takeup speed of the extrudate is 18 ft min. and the extrudate is quenched in ice water. The diameter of extrudate is 21.0 mils.The extrudate is drawn at 5x over a hot shoe held at a temperature of 990C and at 1.2x through a glycerine bath kept at 950 C. The fiber is pulled through a water bath room temperature to remove the glycerine and taken up on a spool. The draw tension for both the first drawing stage is 420 g. and for the second stage 380 g. the total draw ratio is 6.0x. Tensile data for fibers obtained in this and other runs are shown in Table II.Example VFibers prepared from polymer num 9 Table I are strung under a tension of 50 g. on an adjustable annealing rack. The adjustable bar is lowered about 10 to allow the fibers to relax freely. After 16 hours the adjustable bar is raised to a height which is sufficient to straighten the fibers without imparting any tension 0 relaxation . The fibers are subjected to one hour of heating at 1100C and then cut off the annealing rack. Fibers annealed in this manner, upon exposure to free shrinkage 600C 2.5 hours shrink 2.3 as opposed to 15.6 for unannealed strands.
