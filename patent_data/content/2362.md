# Screw vent for devolatilizer.

## Abstract
A vent for a devolatilizer includes a vent opening 20 in the cage 10 of the devolatilizer and a vent duct 22 which communicates with the vent opening. Vapour escapes into the cylindrical vent chamber 24 in the vent duct. The chamber is cleaned by a vent screw which is rotated in the chamber and includes a screw body 26 of minimal diameter and a helical screw flight portion 28 of a pitch which is sufficiently large such that the velocity of the vapour leaving the cage through the vent duct is maintained below a predetermined maximum vapour velocity. This maximum vapour velocity is set such that the amount of fine material which is entrained in the escaping vapour is minimized. A vapour outlet 48 is connected to the vent chamber for extracting vapour from the chamber so that it may be recycled or disposed of.
