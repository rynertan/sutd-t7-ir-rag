# Process for producing high concentration oxygen by a pressure swing adsorption method.

## Abstract
In production of high concentration oxygen by a pressure swing absorption method using air as a raw mate rial, air is introduced into a first step adsorption apparatus packed with a zeolite molecular sieve and is subjected to a pressure swing adsorption operation to obtain a non adsorbed gas comprising oxygen as the major component, argon and nitrogen the non absorbed gas is introduced into a second step adsorption apparatus packed with a carbon molecular sieve and is subjected to a pressure swing adsorption operation to separate argon and nitrogen from oxygen as a non adsorbed gas and the desorbed oxygen is obtained as high concentration oxygen.
