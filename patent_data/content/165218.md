# A MACHINE FOR PROCESSING AN ELASTOMERIC PRODUCT

## Abstract
A machine for processing elastomeric material has two shafts 2, 3 mounted for rotation in a housing 1 in end bearings 6 and carry therebetween two gear pairs 4, 5 4 , 5 in cavities in the housing. In accordance with the invention thre is also provided a channel 12 which connects the gear meshing side of the first gear pair 4, 5 witha space adjacent the second gear pair 4 , 5 centrally opposite the gear meshing sides thereof. The elastomer is taken in through openings adjacent the first gear pair, and is pumped through two gear pumps connected in series, and dis charged from the pressure side of the latter located and at the gear meshing point thereof.
