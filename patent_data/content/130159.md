# Improved photoresponsive amorphous semiconductor materials, methods of making same, and photoanodes made therewith.

## Abstract
A photoresponsive amorphous semiconductor material is modified by incorporating at least one compensating agent selected from a group consisting of hydrogen, lithium, fluorine, beryllium, aluminum, boron, magnesium, other Group I elements, and compounds of these elements. The semiconductor material is cathodically treated either simul taneously with or subsequent to this modification. The semi conductor material may be additionally modified by incor porating a second modifying agent selected from a group consisting of silicon, the transition elements, the lanthanides, and compounds of these elements. The semiconductor mat erial also may be subjected to heat treatment in an inert atmosphere before the cathodic treatment. A photoanode 14 utilizing the above described semi conductor material further includes a substrate 20 to support a film of said material. The photoanode 14 may additionally include, a second semiconductor film having a small band gap inserted between said substrate 20 and said first semi conductor film. These photoanodes 14 may be used in an electrochemical cell for the conversion of light 32 into elec trical energy or energy stored in a fuel.
