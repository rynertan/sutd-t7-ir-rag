## Abstract
A grinding machine utilises a gantry type loader 27 for exchanging workpieces 12, 12a with the work support spindle 11a of the machine. The loading head 33 of the gantry loader has a rotatable workpiece gripper assembly 34 to switch the parts end for end during the loading and unloading process. The loading head is also fitted with non rotating tool grippers 36 which are spring biased to mechanically grip and extract a grinding wheel tool 24 from a grinding wheelhead 13 and exchange the tool 24 with a different tool located in a tool support pocket 54 of a tool storage matrix 37 at a position remote from the grinding wheel head 14 .
