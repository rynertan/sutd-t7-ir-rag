# Thin film power coupler.

## Abstract
It is described a thin film power coupler, in particular a 3 dB and 90 DEG power divider with lumped circuit elements, the main characteristics of which consists in having achieved the coupled inductances 7, 8 9, 10 by mutual induction. Such an achievement has been obtained with two microstrip lines 7, 8 9, 10 facing each other and wrapped as a square shaped spiral 16, 17 . Another important characteristic of the power coupler is the presence of a capacitor 11 in the circuit which joins the two branches 7, 9 8, 10 of the same, with the scope to obtain the wanted coupling and to recover possible tolerances incurred by manufacturing the thin film inductors 7, 8 9, 10 .
