# Data communication system.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a pseudo synchronized data communication system wherein a plurality of remote sta tions 12, 14 , in response to a request from a primary terminal 16 , will transmit requested data to the primary terminal and to a secondary terminal 18 . The secondary terminal is operable to receive and process the data transmit ted in synchronism with the requests from the primary, and without any synchronizing information between the primary and secondary terminals. This is accomplished with the provision of data processing means in the two terminals which have identical memory maps 40, 80 of the sequenc ing operation.
