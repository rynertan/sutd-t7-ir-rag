# Fuel injection pump for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A fuel injection pump for an internal combustion engine including a rotor 1 located in a housing 2 , a free piston 14 movably mounted in an axial bore 13 in the rotor 1 , two pressure chambers 13a, 13b defined by an inner wall surface of the axial bore 13 in the rotor 1 and the free piston 14 , and two solenoid valves 28, 29 for supplying fuel to the pressure chamber 13a, 13b is further provided with means 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 45, 48, 49 for sensing a displacement of the free piston 14 in an axial direction.
