## Description
DESCRIPTION The invention refers to an apparatus and a process as well for the correction of the scoliosis or other spine malformations. The process is already known, as well as an equipment, for carrying out muscular stimuli aiming to provoke a spine deflection in the direction opposite to the one taken up by the spine itself as a consequence of the disease. The muscular stimulus is obtained by the application on the skin of two transcutaneous electrodes, suitably spaced apart, which receive pulsing signals able to stimulate the muscular fascia. The signals are mostly formed with the aid of a carrier wave having a frequency appropriate for the modulation of said carrier wave to obtain signals able to provoke periodic muscular tontractinns, avoiding the muscular fatigue and the subsequent tetanus which would occur in case of continuous stimulus.Whereas the carrier wave may have a frequency of, for instance, 25 Hz, the stimuli for the muscular tissue are made up of trains of pulses which may have for example a duration in the range of six seconds with an equivalent period of pulse interruption. The modulation necessary to obtain the trains of pulses may be performed by a slow oscillator, while at present, said modulation is carried out by an initial inclined ramp to get some graduality in the muscle stimulus so as to cause the muscle contraction to occur gradually besides nowadays, the stimuli stop suddenly. The known apparatus and methods are intended for providing applications at night during the sleeping hours and it is customary that on the early days the applications are carried out by starting with slighter stimuli to make the muscles accustomed to these prolonged intermittent stimuli which have the purpose to strain the spine in the direction suitable to correct the malformation. The apparatus and methods known at present are improved according to the invention with the purpose to make the treatment more effective and to reduce the trouble phenomena which the currently used treatments may provoke in the subjects being treated. A further object of the apparatus and improved methods according to the invention is to obtain a more complete treatment and hence, a more satisfying correction of the deformations coming from the scoliosis. According to the invention, there is provided a gradual attenuation of the single electrical stimuli of the muscular mass so as to avoid the intervention of natural corrective stimuli from the brain, which take place in the present systems at the end of each periodic stimuli during the treatment. To obtain this, there may be used a suitable pro grammable generator and there may be provided means to regulate the time of each ramp of attenuation of the stimuli supplied to the electrodes for the purposes mentioned above. A method and an apparatus improved according to the invention provide also an initial gradual increase of the intensity of the electrical stimuli supplied through the electrodes to the or each muscular fascia, at the beginning of each treatment for intermittent stimulus, that is, for example, at the beginning of each daily treatment during the night sleeping hours.Through this, the musculature is gradually warmed up and the nervous system gets painlessly accuRstomed to the electrical stimulus, whereby the body accepts more comfortably the treatment stimuli as there is excluded any sudden start of them as it occurs instead with the current methodology. This gradual increase may have a length from six to ten minutes there has been found that the intensity of the first stimuli may be, anyhow, of an intermediate magnitude respect to the final value of same stimuli for example the starting stimuli may be of 3O milliamperes and the normal running stimuli in the range of 50 to 70 milliamperes. Means may be provided to control the duration of this initial warming up of the musculature, that is, of this graduality of the stimulus increase at the start of each treatment, and this time of treatment for the warming up may be for example, in the range of eight td thirty minutes, especially in the range of ten to fifteen minutes at the beginning of each treatment. An improved apparatus according to the invention includes, advantageously, more than a pair of cooperating electrodes, to obtain the simultaneous corrective treatment by stimulating a plurality of muscular fasciae at various positions, said fasciae able to receive simultaneous or out of phase stimuli in relation to the opportunity of stimulating in a simultaneous or out of phase way the muscular fasciae affected by the two or more pairs of used electrodes. An improved apparatus according to the invention can also include, advantageously, an alarm or signalling system able to operate at the moment an electrode gets accidentally detached from the zone of the skin where it has been applied by means of adhesive plasters or other to effect the treatment. Practically, there may be provided means for determining the above mentioned alarm signalling, when the resistance between the two electrodes of a pair increases beyond a certain limit, which occurs in case of removal, that is, detaching o of an electrode. This may be obtained with the use, for example, of a trigger. Means may also be provided for determining an analogous alarm signal, when a drop of the electrical stimuli power takes place below a programmed threshold, for example, below 30 milliamperes. The accompanying drawing shows an exemplification not limitative of the criteria accomplishment on which the invention is based. In particular Fig.i shows a diagram of both initial and normal running stimuli Fig.2 shows a signal as obtained by a carrier wave modulation, of course with altered dimensions for the sake of the drawing evidence Fig.3 shows in a very schematic way a possible application of the pairs of electrodes for correcting two opposite deflections and Fig.4 shows a circuit diagram. According to the accompanying drawing, in Fig.1 there is shown a diagram of the stimuli in amplitude in function of the time. The stimuli have a medium length 21 in the range of six seconds, with time intervals 22 between them, equal to or different from Ti. Each pulse I, as shown also in Fig.2 has an initial ramp R1 which makes the muscular contraction to occur gradually each pulse I is further defined by an end ramp R2 also inclined, to get a gradual attenuation of the signal and hence of the muscular contraction, so as to make the stimulus physiologically more acceptable, without tiring out the subject. In Pig.1 a diagram is shown illustrating an initial period up to the time Tc during which a gradual increase of the pulses intensity takes place according to a ramp Rn rising from a value of the signal intensity which may be about half the running one, said running being reached after a time Tc ranging from six to ten minutes. This graduality is imposed at the beginning of each daily or anyway periodical treatment. During subsequent treatments it is possible to change the power P of the pulses to get the most suitable one for each subject. The graduality according to the ramp Ri of the stimuli accomplished at the beginning of each treatment, in order to warm. up the musculature, may be constant with the changing of the power P, or may be quite an almost direct function of this power. In Fig,3 there is shown in a very schematic way a manner of utilizing two pairs of electrodes El andE2 to correct, through muscular stimuli, the two deflections which may occur in some cases in the spineCV as a consequence of the kind of sc Iiosis so called with multiple deflections. The two pairs of electrodes are so located as to operate on the muscular fasciae which are on the side of the respective convexities in order to operate as to attenuate the same convexities by means of the muscular contractions. The presence of two pairs of electrodes permits to carry on the treatment simultaneously on the two deflections.In this way there are obtained corrective treatments of the double side deformations, and by appropriate positions of the electrodes it is also possible to obtain corrections of deflections on the lateral planet In Fig.4 there is shown a circuit diagram for carrying out the invention the circuit can feed the two pairs of electrodes El and E2 placed on the user circuit Cl. In the diagram the block C2 is the power amplifier circuit, down stream of which a diode D1 provides to shut out reverse stimuli, while the trimmers Xrts Tr2 are provided for regulating the voltages and hence the power P. Dhe circuit C3 is a frequency generator for the carrier wave, for example at 25 Hz.A programmable generator C4, controlled through a flip flop Fp forming part of the generator itself, permits the formation of the initial ramps Ri of pulses I. A phase voltage coulparator Ct is a part of this programmed generator circuit C4 the pulsing signal is supplied through the flip flop Fp. By GR there is indicated a reference voltage generator. A circuit C6 forms a slow oscillator to obtain pulsesI at the frequency, for example, of six seconds pulse and six seconds interval it comprises trimmers Tr3 and r4 for controlling the times of stimulus and rest ON and OFF respectively. A block C7 with integrator is used for controlling the time of the ramps R1 and R2.The circuit C8 is a generator of initial preheating to regulate the time Tc of ramp Ri which provides for the gradual increase of the pulses intensity during the initial period of every treatment for the warming up of the muscular fascia or fasciae and for avoiding the initial troubles which would occur with stimuli taking place from the very beginning of the running condition. By C9 there is indicated an alarm circuit with controllers for the alarm threshold.By Ac there is indicated an acoustic warner, fed according to the frequency of the slow oscillator C6, through a signal adaptor Ad and under the control of circuit G9. The operator has the possibility to regulate the running intensity P of signal I. By means of a loose cable connected through a multiple plug SM it is possible to have a remote manual drive for controls, X ray photographs and the like. A switch SW3 at rest shuts out the pulses neutralizing circuit C7. The circuit C7 is put at rest by the resistor R37. By commuting on SW3 we can have, at will, a continuous stimulus, for example for X ray photographs or for getting extended pulses for various observations useful to the physician . On the remote control knob, there may be, advanta geously, a visual display Q with some tEDs which indicate some threshold values of the stimulating pulse intensity. There may be also provided an acoustic signal Z2 to indicate a particular value taken up by the pulse and suited e.g. for a X ray photographic exposure. It must be understood that the drawing shows only one embodiment of the invention which may vary as regard to forms and dispositions without, nevertheless, departing from the basic concept of te invention itself.
