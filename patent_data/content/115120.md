# Rotary cordierite heat regenerator highly gas tight and method of producing the same.

## Abstract
Highly gas tight rotary cordierite heat regenerator 1 is formed of a honeycomb structural body having a porosity of 20 45 and mainly consisting of cordierite, and open pores 4, 6 of the partition walls 3 defining channels of the honeycomb structural body are sealed with a filler 5 thereto, the difference of thermal expansion between the honeycomb structural body and the filler 5 being less than 0.1 at 800 C. The honeycomb structural body is made by preparing fired segments 2 thereof, sealing the open pores of the partition walls 3 with the filler 5 , thereof, bonding the segments 2 with a ceramic bonding material, and firing the bonded segments 2 .
