# Method for forming a superconductive joint between multifilament superconductors.

## Abstract
Superconductive conductors, having as many as thousands of filaments, are joined together to form a true superconductive joint. The method is particularly applicable in the situation in which superconductive filaments are embedded in an overlying or surrounding matrix of resistive material such as copper or aluminum. The resistive material is removed by chemical dissolution to expose a length of superconductive filaments. The filaments are juxtaposed within a sleeve of superconductive material which is crimped about the exposed filaments. The connection may be completed by thermally fusing the exposed ends of the filaments.
