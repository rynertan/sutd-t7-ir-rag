# TRANSCEIVER FOR MULTI DROP LOCAL AREA NETWORKS

## Abstract
A multi drop local area network utilizes alternating current power lines as a transmission channel. Identical transceivers are used as a master and as up to 255 slaves. Each transceiver comprises modulator and demodulator units and a microprocessor control unit which may be connected to a host. The modulator and demodulator are connected to the alternating current power line through a high pass filter comprising a split bobbin, iron core transfor mer having an air gap which also provides impedance matching. The demodulator includes a clipper and analog circuitry providing a band pass filter and generating a square wave corresponding to the received carrier. A state machine acting as a digital filter produces a received carrier signal only when each half cycle of the carrier square wave is of the proper duration and the carrier signal has existed for slightly more than one half of the transmitted bit duration, which is a predetermined number of carrier cycles. The microprocessors are programmed to provide for block ahead acknowledgment, alternate transmissions be tween master and slaves each block message comprises an acknowledgment non acknowledgment bit, a message sequ ence bit, a polling sequence bit, and a longitudinal redundan cy check. The carrier frequency utilized lies in the range of 20 to 40 KHz and preferably within the range between 27 and 33 KHz for a power line transmission channel. Error free 1200 Baud transmission rates are achieved in full duplex. Higher carrier frequencies and transmission rates are possible over less noisy transmission channels such as wire pairs.
