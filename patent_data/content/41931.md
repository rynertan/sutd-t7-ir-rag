# A beverage extracting and dispensing machine for use with cartridges containing a brewable product.

## Abstract
A beverage extracting and dispensing machine for use with flattened round cartridges which contain a brewable product, such as ground coffee, freeze dried coffee, tea, broth and the like. The cartridges have permeable upper and lower walls and a substantially cylindrical sidewall. A cartridge C may be slid to a brewing station 102 in which it is laterally embraced by opposite clamping jaws 114 . During its movement to the brewing station 102 , a new cartridge spreads the jaws apart and pushes an old cartridge away from the brewing station. The spreading apart of the jaws 114 starts an automatic brewing cycle at the beginning of which a presser plate 78 is lowered onto the cartridge and presses it with a tight seal on an underlying fixed support 94 while the cartridge is laterally clamped by the jaws. Then a predetermined amount of hot water under pressure is flowed into the cartridge from a passage in the presser plate 78 and the beverage is dispensed from the cartridge through a passage in the support to fill an underlying cup T or similar container.
