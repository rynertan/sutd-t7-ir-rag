# Laser endoscope apparatus.

## Abstract
A laser endoscope includes a micro thin optic cable assembly 34 which may be inserted into a body cavity by micro surgical or non surgical procedures. A coherent tack eted fibre optical bundle is provided in the centre of the assembly having a diameter of no more than 3.5 mm with an optical lens system at the distal end 36 for reflecting an image of a portion of the interior of the cavity. A pair of single optical fibres are spirally wound around the cable one of these fibres carries a laser light beam to the cavity and the other is for redundancy. The proximate end 38 of the optical cable assembly connects to a remote unit R wherein a laser diode light source is provided to direct a beam of light into the end 88 of one of the single optical fibres. A TV camera in the remote unit, together with suitable optics, transmit the image from the optical cable to a viewing screen on the remote unit.
