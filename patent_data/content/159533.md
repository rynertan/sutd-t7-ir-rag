## Description
The present invention relates to thiatriazine derivatives which have histamine H 2 antagonist activity.The invention also relates to processes for the preparation of these derivatives, to pharmaceutical preparations comprising them, and to their use. Histamine is one of a number of naturally occurring physiologically active substances which are thought to interact with specific receptors. In the case of histamine, there are at least two types one is called theH l receptor Ash and Schild, Brit. J. Pharmac. 1966, 27, 427 , and the other is called the H 2 receptor Black et al Nature 1972, 236, 385 . The action of histamine at the H l receptor, for example, stimulation of bronchial and gastro intestinal smooth muscle, is blocked by the compounds generally known as antihistamines , but which are now also called histamine H l antagonists, for example, mepyramine. The action of histamine at the H 2 receptors, for example, stimulation of gastric acid secretion and heart rate, is not blocked by mepyramine but is blocked by other compounds, for example, burimamide and cimetidine. Histamine H 2 antagonists may be used to treat those conditions resulting from stimulation by histamine of H 2 receptors, either alone, for example, in inhibiting gastric acid secretion and thus treating its sequelae, for example, gastric and peptic ulcers or together with H l antagonists, for example, in allergic and certain inflammatory conditions. The present invention provides compounds of formulaI, which are histamine H 2 antagonists EMI1.1 in which formulaR represents a hydrogen atom, a straight or branched chain alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a phenyl group or a phenalkyl group, the alkyl moiety of which has a straight or branched chain and from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkyl, phenyl or phenalkyl group being unsub stituted or substituted by one or more substitutents, which may be the same or different, for example, by one or two substitutents, especially by one substitutent, selected from halogen atoms, straight and branched chain alkyl groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, straight and branched chain alkoxy groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, nitro and trifluoromethyl groups W and Z, which may be the same or different, each represents a group E CH2 X CH2 m NH in which E represents a phenyl, imidazolyl, thiazolyl, furyl, thienyl, or pyridyl radical, which radicals may be unsubstituted or may have one or two substitutents, selected from straight and branched chain alkyl groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, guanidino and mono alkyl guanidino groups, the alkyl moiety of which has a straight or branched chain and from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and groups of the formula IIEMI2.1 in which Q represents an alkylene group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, each represents a hydrogen atom, a straight or branched chain alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, R1 and R2 form a 4 to 8 membered ring which may contain an oxygen atom or another nitrogen atom, which nitrogen atom may have an alkyl substitutent having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or one of W and Z represents a group E CH2 n X CH2 m NH as defined above, and the other represents a hydrogen atom a straight or branched chain alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms a phenyl group an OR 3 group in which R3 represents a straight or branched chain alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or an NR4R5 group in which R4 and R5, which may be the same or different, each represents a hydrogen atom, an unsubstituted or substituted straight or branched chain alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group X represents 0 or S n represents 0 or 1 and m represents 2, 3 or 4. This invention also provides salts of a compound of formula I, especially physiologically tolerable salts. Alkyl groups in the present specification may be branched or unbranched, and alkyl groups, for example, alkyl groups R4 and R5, may be unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by one or more, for example, one or two, groups selected from i oR6 groups in which R6 represents a straight or branched chain alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms ii cycloalkyl groups having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms iii NR7 R8 groups in which R7 and R8, which may be the same or different, each represents a hydrogen atom, a straight or branched chain alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a phenyl group or an acyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety, and R7 and R8 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached may form a 5 or 6 membered ring iv COOR9 groups in which R9 represents a straight or branched chain alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms v CONR7 R8 groups in which R7 and R8 are defined above vi alkylsulphonyl groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety and phenylsulphonyl groups vii cyano and nitro groups viii phenyl groups which may be substituted by one or two substitutents, which may be the same or different, selected from alkyl, alkoxy, methylenedioxy, phenoxy, halogen, dimethylaminomethyl, trifluoromethyl, nitro, cyano, sulphonic acid, sulphonamide, amino, mono alkylamino and di alkylamino groups, an alkyl moiety having a straight or branched chain and from 1 to 4 carbon atoms ix aromatic and non aromatic heterocyclic groups having from 5 to 8 ring members and one or two hetero atoms selected from oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen atoms, and optionally having an alkyl substitutent having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms on a ring nitrogen atom, for example, a furyl, tetrahydrofuryl thienyl, pyridyl, dihydropyranyl, pyrrolidinyl, N lower alkyl pyrrolidinyl, or piperidyl group. A phenyl group other than a phenyl group E which is as defined above , may be unsubstituted or substituted as defined in viii above. It will be understood that the structure given above for formula I is only one of several possible tautomeric and isomeric representations. The present invention includes all possible tautomeric and isomeric forms of compounds of the general formula I. In the present specification the term lower is used to denote a group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The term halogen denotes chlorine, bromine, iodine and fluorine. The term known is used herein to mean in actual use in the art or described in the literature of the art. It will be appreciated by a worker skilled in the art that a combination of substitutents that are incompatible for steric reasons or because of potential inter reactions should not be chosen. The worker will also use his normal discretion in the number of substitutents chosen. The present invention also provides a process for the production of a compound of formula I, which comprises reacting a 1,2,4,6 thiatriazine of formula IIIA or IIIBEMI5.1 in which R, W and Z are as defined above, W and L having any of the meanings given above, and L represents a halogen atom, an alkoxy, phenoxy or phenylalkoxy group, an alkylthio, phenylthio or phenylalkylthio group, an alkylsulphinyl, phenylsulphinyl or phenalkylsulphinyl group, or an alkylsulphonyl, phenylsulphonyl or phenylalkylsulphonyl group, in which groups an alkyl group or alkyl moiety has a straight or branched chain and from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and a phenyl group may be substituted as defined in viii above, with a compound of the general formula IV E CH2 n X cH2 m NH2 IV in which E, X, m and n are as defined for formula I, and, if desired, carrying out any one or more of the following reactions in any desired order i converting a group R into another group R, ii converting an acid addition salt of formula I into the corresponding free base or converting a free base into an acid addition salt, or iii in a resulting compound of formula I in which one of the groups D and Z represents a group NR4R5, converting this group into another group NR4R5. In addition to serving as a substituent in the final product, R4 may also act as a protecting group in the above chemical transformations and may subsequently be removed, for example, by hydrogenolysis or by acid or base catalysed hydrolysis to provide a compound of the general formula I in which W or Z is a group NHR5 or NH2. Protecting groups which come within the definition of R4 are t butyl and benzyl groups, for example. Compound IV is generally reacted with compound IIIA or with compound IIIB in a solvent or diluent, preferably in an alcohol, acetone, acetonitrile or DMF. The reaction temperature is, for example, within the range of from 0 to 800 C, depending on the nature of the leaving group L.Generally when L is a halogen atom, an alkylsulphinyl group or a substituted phenoxy group, the reaction occurs rapidly at O to 200C, but when L is an alkylthio or alkoxy group, elevated reaction temperatures, for example, in the range of from 50 to 1000C, for example, from 60 to 800C are preferred. The compound of formula IV is reacted in the form of the free base, as shown. If it is initially present in the form of an acid addition salt, for example, as the hydrochloride or hydrobromide, this is converted into the free base during or, preferably, before reaction with compound IIIA or IIIB. Conversion is carried out with an organic or inorganic base, for example, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, or a tertiary amine, for example, triethylamine. A compound of formula I may be converted into its salt form in the usual manner by reaction with an acid.Examples of physiologically tolerable acid addition salts are those with hydrobromic, hydrochloric, sulphuric, acetic, malonic, maleic, fumaric, succinic, citric, tartaric and isethionic acids. A compound of formula I in the form of an acid addition salt may be converted into the free base form by reaction with a base in the usual manner. A number of compounds of the type represented by formula IV are known, see, for example, GB Specification 2,001,624A U.S. Patent 3,950,333 U.S. Patent 4,128,658 and Belgian Patents 867,106 and 875,846, and the others may be prepared analogously.

Compound XIV is generally reacted with one equivalent of anhydrous ammonia, preferably in an inert solvent, for example, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, preferably at a temperature in the range of from 0 to 200C to give compound XV, which is cyclised to the thiatriazine XVII by reaction with ortho ester XVI.This reaction may be carried out using an excess of the ortho ester as solvent or, preferably, using an inert solvent, for example, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or diglyme, preferably at an elevated temperature, for example, from 80 to 1600C. Imidocarbonates and dithioimidocarbonates of formulaXIII are known, see for example, Z. Chem. 8, 459 460, 1968 , Beilstein E113 page 156, and Bull. inst.recherches biol. unic. Perm, 6, 10 , 517 522, 1929 . Thiatriazines of formula XII or formula XVII in which R10 represents an alkylthio, phenylthio or phenylalkylthio group may be converted to other compounds of formula IIIA, for example, by oxidation of the thio group to the corresponding sulphinyl or sulphonyl group, or by replacement of the alkylthio, phenylthio or phenylalkylthio group by a halogen atom, especially a chlorine atom, for example, as shown in Scheme III, in which yl represents a halogen atom, for example, a chlorine atom, R13 represents an alkyl, phenyl or phenylalkyl group, for example, a lower alkyl, phenyl or benzyl group, and x represents 1 or 2. Scheme IIIEMI11.1 Such a conversion may be carried out by known methods, for example, by oxidising the sulphide group using, for example, a peracid, for example, m chloroperbenzoic acid hydrogen peroxide or a periodate, perborate or permanganate salt. Replacement of an alkylthio or arylthio group by a halogen atom may be carried out, for example, by treating compound XVIII with excess chlorine or bromine, for example, by treatment with elemental chlorine or bromine, or with a compound capable of yielding the desired halogen, for example, phosphorus pentachloride.The halogenation is generally carried out in an inert solvent, for example, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, an ether or an ester, for example, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran or ethyl acetate, generally at a temperature within the range of from 20 to 1000C, and preferably in the presence of a catalyst, for example, anhydrous zinc chloride.

Compound XXII is then reacted with a primary or secondary amine XXIII in an aprotic solvent, for example, diethyl ether, dichloromethane or acetonitrile, generally at a temperature within the range of from 40 to 200C to give a mixture of isomers XXIV and XXV, which can be separated by known methods, for example, by fractional crystallisation or by chromatography.Higher temperatures, for example, from 0 to 200C generally give a mixture of the two isomers, whereas lowering the temperature of the reaction between compounds XXII andXXIII to within the range of from 40 to 200C gives predominantly the isomer of formula XXIV. Isomers XXIV and XXV fall within the general formulae IIIA and IIIB respectively.
