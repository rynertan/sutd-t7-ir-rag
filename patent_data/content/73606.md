# Condensation products of aromatic sulphonic acids with formaldehyde.

## Abstract
A dispersing agent which is a a condensation product of a substituted phenol sulfonic acid which is an arylphenol sulfonic acid or an aralkylphenol sulfonic acid with from about 0.5 to about 4 moles of formaldehyde per mole of substituted phenol sulfonic acid, or b a condensation product of i a substituted phenol sulfonic acid which is an arylphenol sulfonic acid or an aralkylphenol sulfonic acid and ii an aryl sulfonic acid with from about 0.5 to about 4 moles of formaldehyde per mole of substituted phenol sulfonic acid and aryl sulfonic acid wherein the weight ratio of substituted phenol sulfonic acid to aryl sulfonic acid is from about 0.95 0.05 to about 0.05 0.95. The dispersing agent may be used directly or reacted with a salt forming cation to obtain a salt. The condensation product is useful as a dispersing agent in hydraulic cement, mortar, con crete or the like.
