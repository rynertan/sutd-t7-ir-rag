# SIGNAL PROCESSING DEVICE FOR DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND MULTIPLEXING

## Abstract
A signal processing device in which a video signal 1 and a digital signal are subjected to digital processing simultaneously in such a manner that the number of A D or D A converters is reduced. An analog input video signal 1 is A D converted to produce a cyclical signal synchronized with a horizontal or vertical synchronizing signal contained within the video signal. The signal so converted is then processed via an arithmetic unit 23, 24, 26 , and then other digital information may be added thereto. The finally processed signal 31 is transmitted via an internal bus 27 in synchro nization with the horizontal or vertical synchronizing signal component of the video signal.
