# CMOS FULL ADDER CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A full adder circuit includes a sum circuit section, a carry out circuit section, a carry in circuit section and an output circuit section. The sum circuit section includes a plurality of N channel type MOS transistors having their gates adapted to receive true and complement binary addend signals of an ith order. The sum circuit section also includes a plurality of N channel type of MOS transistors having their gates adapted to receive true and complement binary augend signals of an ith order. The carry out circuit section includes a plurality of N channel type MOS transis tors having their gates adapted to receive true and comple ment binary addend signals of an ith order. The carry out circuit section also includes a plurality of N channel MOS transistors having their gates adapted to receive true and complement binary augend signals of an ith order. The carry in circuit section is formed of a plurality of N channel type MOS transistors having their gates adapted to receive true and complement carry in signals of an ith 1 order. The output circuit section includes a first pair of cross coupled P channel type MOS transistors connected to the sum circuit section and having their drains connected to respective true and complement sum output terminals. The output circuit section further includes a second pair of cross coupled P channel type MOS tansistors connected to the carry out circuit section and having their drains connected to respec tive true and complement carry out terminals. All of the transistors are arranged on an integrated circuit substrate with topological regularity.
