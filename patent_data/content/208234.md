## Description
The present invention relates to a high permittivity ceramic composition suitable for use in a capacitor, particularly a multi layer type capacitor incorporating thin metal films. At this time, the most widely used material for capacitors is a barium titanate based dielectric ceramic composition. However, the ceramic composition based on barium titanate is not highly adaptive to mass production, since it requires high firing temperatures in the range of 1300 1400 C. This BaTiO₃ based ceramic material may be employed in a multi layer type capacitor, but this is only possible when either platinum or palladium, which are capable of withstanding the aforementioned high temperatures, is used as the material for the thin metal film incorporated as an internal electrode. The present invention provides a dielectric ceramic composition which can be produced by firing at temperatures not higher than 1100 C and which yet retains a dielectric constant of 2000 or more at 20 C. This composition is represented by the formula xPb Ni 1 3 Nb 2 3 0₃ yPbTiO₂ zPb W 1 2 Nb 1 2 O₃ wherein x y z 1.0, and which is included within the hexagonal area which is defined by connecting points A B C D E F A inclusive of the six points and the connecting lines therebetween marked on the ternary composition diagram which is shown in the drawing, on a molar fraction basis The attached drawing shows a ternary composition diagram for the ceramic composition of the present invention which is represented by the formula xPb Ni 1 3 Nb 2 3 O₃ yPbTiO₃ zPb W 1 2 Ni 1 2 O₃. As will be apparent from the data given in Table 1 below, samples of the compostion included within the hexagonal area which is defined by connecting points A B C D E F A marked on the ternary composition diagram shown in the drawing can be sintered at temperatures of up to 1100 C and yet exhibited satisfactory properties. Starting materials which are commercially available and indicated below were mixed together in such amounts as to provide 20 samples of final products having compositions included within the ternary composition diagram as shown in the attached drawing. PbO 99.5 pure NiCO₃ 90.0 pure Nb₂O₅ 99.5 pure TiO₂ 99.0 pure WO₃ 99.5 pure Twenty batches, each weighing 2000 g, of the mixtures of these ingredients were individually charged into a polyurethanelined alumina pot mill capacity 4,000 ml containing 2000 g of alumina balls 10 mm average diameter . Each batch was subjected to primary dis integration and mixing for 3 hours by a dry mixing method. Thereafter, each batch was calcined by being held in the air at an optimum temperature between 700 and 800 C for a period of 2 hours. Appropriate amounts of an organic binder and water were added to the disintegrated particles in each lot. The particles were subjected to secondary disintegration and mixing at 90 rpm for 16 hours in the same alumina pot mill that was used for the primary disintegration and mixing. The particles were then granulated by spray drying. The granules in each lot were formed into a disk 30 mm average diameter x 1 mm thickness in a molding press at a pressure of 1000 kg cm². The thus formed disks were sintered at optimal temperatures for 2 hours in an atmosphere of PbO by standard techniques. An electrode was formed on both principal surfaces of each sintered product by firing silver. The twenty samples of the ceramic composition thus prepared were tested for their dielectric loss, capacitance, and insulation resistance by the following methods. The results are summarized in Table 1. Dielectric loss and capacitance Measured with a digital LCR meter at 25 C and at 1 kHz and 1 volt rms Insulation resistance A voltage of 100 volts was applied for 1 minute across a sample finished to have a thickness of 0.5 mm. Sample Nos. 1 to 13 were the compositions of the present invention which were included within the hexagonal area defined by connecting points A B C D E F A, inclusive of the six points and the connecting lines therebetween marked on the ternary composition diagram shown in the attachment. These samples could be produced by sintering at temperatures not higher than 1100 C, and yet retained values of dielectric constant which were not lower than 2000. On the other hand, sample Nos. 14 to 20, which were outside of the hexagonal area, failed to satisfy the desired properties, either with respect to sintering temperature 1100 C or the dielectric constant 2000 . That is, they either had to be sintered at temperatures higher than 1100 C or exhibited values of dielectric constant less than 2000. The dielectric ceramic composition of the present invention which is included within the hexagonal area defined by connecting points A B C D E F A marked on the ternary composition diagram shown in the attached drawing can be sintered at a temperature of up to 1100 C and yet exhibits a dielectric constant no smaller than 2000 while satisfying other requirements for use in high permittivity ceramic capacitors, such as low dielectric loss and change in capacitance. Because of this advantage, the ceramic composition of the present invention is highly useful for mass production of capacitors. In addition, it can be employed in a multi layer type ceramic capacitor with silver or an alloy thereof being used as an internal electrode metal. Since silver or alloys thereof are far less expensive than the heretofore used high melting metals such as platinum and vanadium, the manufacturing cost of multi layer type ceramic capacitors can be significantly reduced by using the high permittivity ceramic composition of the present invention. While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
