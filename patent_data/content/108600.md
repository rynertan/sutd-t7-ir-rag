# Visible tamper proof closure arrangement and method of making the same.

## Abstract
A tamper proof closure arrangement for a container includes in one embodiment a seal 16 applied to seal receiving surfaces 76, 40 of the container 12 and closure cap 14 such that the seal is applied internally of the closure cap without removing the closure cap and is irreversibly damaged by any attempt to remove the closure cap, the seal being visible through the closure cap to provide a visual indication of tampering. In an alternative embodiment, the seal 100 is fixed internally of a disposable cap 84 which is mounted on an associated container 62 to overlie a reusable closure cap 74 . The seal is visually observable through the disposable cap and is formed in contracting relation against a three dimensional surface 82 on the reusable cap such that any attempt at removing the dispos able cap irreversibly damages or deforms the seal to provide a visual indication of tampering.
