# Developer apparatus.

## Abstract
A liquid developing apparatus employing an applicator roll and metering and pressure blades in contact with the applica tor roll is provided with a wick for applying the developer liquid to the roll. The wick is moved into and out of contact with the surface of the applicator roll to be withdrawn whenever the ap paratus is stopped in order to allow uniform drying of the roll surface to forestall the possibility of non uniform development treatment which otherwise might occur when the apparatus is next used. A special support is provided for the bar which car ries the metering blade, the bar being rockably carried in sup port plates which are pivoted on the frame and adjustable while the apparatus is operating to adjust the attitude of the metering blade relative to the applicator roll surface and there by control the amount of developer liquid which the roll surface is applying to the copy sheets.
