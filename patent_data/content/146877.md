# HIGH VOLTAGE BLEEDER FOR X RAY GENERATOR

## Abstract
A low inductance capacitor is used in a dual function mode, as both the filter capacitor at the output of a high voltage rectifier and as the high voltage capacitor of a bleeder network. In this way, the capacitors which are normally required for the high voltage loop of the voltage divider can be eliminated.
