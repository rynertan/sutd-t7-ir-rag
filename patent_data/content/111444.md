# SNOW AND ICE DEVICE THAT CAN BE QUICKLY APPLIED TO AUTOVEHICLE TIRES

## Abstract
The snow and ice device consists of at least a ring 2 to be applied, with the insertion of a series of plugs 3 of adjustable height, against the outside sidewall of a tire P . On the outside, a plurality of guides 4 is solid with the ring 2 and steel elements 5 acting as claws and bent into a U, slide radially in the guides. A first leg 8 of said elements 5 , which is on the outside of the wheel, can slide in said guides 4 , while a second shorter inside leg 9 carries, at its top, a roller 13 that is able to roll against the inside sidewall of the tire, while the base 12 of the claw, intended to penetrate the snow or ice, continuously follows the deflection and relaxation move ments of the tire. These latter movements. and thereby the effectiveness of the device, are favored by the fact that said ring 2 and said claws 5 constitute, in any rotating position of the wheel, a unit that floats with respect to the rim and therefore of the wheel itself.
