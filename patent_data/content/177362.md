# Portable radio communication apparatus comprising an antenna member for a broad band signal.

## Abstract
In a portable radio communication apparatus compris ing a handset 20 having a side surface 23 and a recessed surface 24 , first and second antennae 51 and 52 of different resonance frequencies are fixed to the recessed surface by first and second conductive plates 55 and 56 , respectively. First and second conductive lines 61 and 62 connect a common conductive line 63 to the first and the second antennae, respectively. The common conductive line is connected to an electro audio and audio electro convert ing device 30 to feed a transmitting electric signal to the first and the second antennae and to receive the received electric signal from the first and the second antennae. The first and the second antennae have first and second antenna widths W₁ and W₂ , respectively. The first and the second conductive plates have first and second plate widths, respectively, and first and second axes centrally of the first and the second plate widths, respectively, The first and the second plate widths are not greater than the first and the second antenna widths, respectively. The first and the second axes are spaced wider than a half of a sum of the first and the second antenna widths.
