# Energy storage flywheels.

## Abstract
A flywheel comprising a rim 1 which is a substantially circular ring mounted on a central portion 2 which central portion comprises at least one substantially circular dished member which has a specific modulus which is less than the specific modulus of the rim, the dished member being curved such that increasing rotational speed tends to elastically deform the dished member, straightening the curve, thereby increasing the diameter of the dished mem ber. In a preferred embodiment, the central portion 2 comprises at least two co axial dished members 3,4 which are imperforate apart from a central hole 5 , each dished member comprising three integrally formed annular por tions, two of the portions 6,8 being curved and being positioned on each side of the third portion which is straight or curved.
