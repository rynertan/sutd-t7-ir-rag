# Very low crystallinity catalyst made from crystalline zeolite and process for catalytic dewaxing pour point reduction of waxy hydrocarbon oils using said catalyst.

## Abstract
It has been discovered that the pour point and wax content of waxy hydrocarbon oils, either natural or derived from synthetic sources such as tar sands, shale oil, etc., preferably natural waxy petroleum oils, most preferably waxy lube, transformer, specialty oils and waxy fuels such as kerosene or jet fuel, can be effectively reduced under standard catalytic dewaxing conditions using an aluminosili cate catalyst with very low crystallinity VLC , as measured by X ray diffraction. These VLC materials are derived from crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites, which will not them selves reduce the pour point and wax content of waxy hydrocarbon oils, by the thermal decomposition of said zeolites following their exchange with cations which yield hydroxyl groups during the thermal decomposition step. A suitable cation is NHâ‚„ .
