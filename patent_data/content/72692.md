# Controlling the tension in platform supporting tension legs.

## Abstract
Methods and apparatus are disclosed for tension com pensation in the tension legs 22 used to moor a floating platform to the sea floor. The apparatus includes one or more hydraulic jacks, each having a cylinder 52 coupled through a load block 42 to a tension leg 22 , and having a piston cooperating with a load block plug 64 coupled to the floating platform. An accumulator 60 supplies hydraulic fluid to the jacks to compensatingly adjust the relative position of the piston and cylinder to selectively maintain the tension loading of the tension leg.
