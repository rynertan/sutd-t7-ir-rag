# Video record systems.

## Abstract
A video record system includes a record disk 12 and a read write head 19. A signal to be recorded is received on line 15 and processed by a converter26 before being passed to the read write head 19. A signal read from the disk 12 by the read write head 19 is passed through a converter 30 and a digital signal processor 32 to a television 14. In this video record system the length of a mark along a record track 20 on the disk 12 represents a four bit binary storage code block and the player recorder system operates in eight bit system code blocks. Thus, two marks on the disk represent a single system code block. The bits of the system code block are assigned to bit positions of the storage code blocks in such a way that there is a reduction in the affect in the associated system of errors in initially writing or subsequently reading a mark. The increments of mark length are also made non constant to reduce the effect in the associated system of errors in mark length.
