# Computer software protection system.

## Abstract
In a digital computing system with a central processing unit CPU40 and random access memory RAM48 , an improved data access limitation and protection subsystem is disclosed which protects data stored within predetermined boundaries of the RAM. An operation code detector 22 de tects a unique operation code stored in the RAM and fetched by the CPU, and puts out a signal when the unique operation code is detected. An address latch 23 stores a high and a low digital boundary address put out by the CPU when the address latch is enabled by the signal from the operation code detector. An address comparator 25 compares digital addresses subsequently put out by the CPU with the stored boundary addresses and puts out a signal as the result of the comparison. The address comparator signal controls a switch which enables and disables an address transformer 43 and a bi directional data transformer 41 . A byte of data written by the CPU to the RAM is encoded by the data transformer, and a byte of data fetched by the CPU from the RAM is decoded by the data transformer and the digital address location to which the byte of data is written and from which it is fetched is different than the digital address generated by the CPU in its normal mode of operation, if the digital address of the byte within the RAM is not greater than the high boundary address and not less than the low boundary address.

## Description
COMPUTER SOFTWARE PROTECTION SYSTEM The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for protecting software from unauthorized access, use, and or misappropriation. More particularly, the present invention relates to methods and apparatus for safeguarding software within a microcomputer by the use of concurrent translation of data and addresses within a predetermined protection area of main memory in accordance with an algorithm which is made unique for each microcomputer equipped with the present protection system. The need for safeguarding software from unauthorized access, removal, and duplication has become particularly acute with the proliferation and widespread use of monolithic microprocessor based microcomputers. The effort required by skilled programmers to design, encode, and perfect a commercially useful program can frequently be measured in terms of man months or years. Such software is then copied onto moveable storage media, most commonly floppy diskettes, which are then distributed to authorized users. If it develops that the particular software is worthwhile, the distribution thereof becomes widespread, as does the temptation to make unauthorized copies and uses. There have been a number of proposals for copyprotecting floppy diskettes. Such efforts have met with limited success, and their mere existence has led to development of software intended to break through the copy protection scheme. One significant drawback of copyprotection schemes is that authorized users are precluded from making back up copies of software programs and data bases. There have been several proposals for protecting software within a computer by adapting both the hardware and the software thereof to operate only in accordance with an algorithm which is made unique for each separate computer. One such proposal is found in the United StatesPatent No. 4,246,638, issued to William J. Thomas. TheThomas patent proposed a method for preliminarily encoding the operation code portion of an instruction as a function of the location of the instruction in main memory and as a function of the state of the computer at the time the instruction was to be executed. The drawbacks of the Thomas approach, in addition to the inherent complexity of the many uniquely connected circuit elements required to process aThomas encoded program, included the fact that it encoded only operation codes and, optionally, operands, but not addresses, and it dedicated three bit positions of the address bus to enable and disable the protection function.The Thomas approach thus provided only a moderate level of protection at the high price of severely restricting the size of main memory. Another proposal is found in the United StatesPatent No. 4,168,396 to Robert M. Best. The Best patent describes a software protection system which deciphered preliminarily encoded information by combining the information with its address. A significant drawback of theBest approach is that it contemplated a computing environment wherein only protected software would be used with the proposed hardware. Thus, Best proposed in one preferred embodiment that the lower half of main memory be protected, thereby making it impractical, if not impossible, for the computer hardware to be usefully applied in connection with software which was not preliminarily encoded in accordance with the Best approach. The widespread and increasing use of computers makes ever more pressing the need for a practical, costeffective computer software protection system which does not interfere with the non protected use of a computer and which provides for an encoding scheme of sufficient complexity to effectively eliminate the problem of unauthorized software usage. The present invention addresses this need directly with a method and apparatus for temporarily protecting a limited and variable segment of computer memory. Software security is insured by transforming operation codes, data, and address locations within said segment, yet computer users have the complete and unencumbered use of their machines when the system is quiesced. One general object of the present invention is to provide a software protection system which overcomes the limitations and drawbacks of the prior art approaches. Another principle object of the present invention is to prevent unauthorized copying and use of software protected in accordance with the principles of the present invention. A further object of the present invention is to provide a simplified and improved protection system which is readily implemented with available hardware elements or fabricated as a monolithic VLSI package, or as a hybrid circuit. One more important object of the present invention is to provide an improved protection system which is totally transparent to the user and which remains quiescent until invoked by a unique operation code word, thereby enabling the full range of computer resources to be made available for use with non protected software. Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved protection system which enables protected and non protected software to run concurrently on the same computer. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved protection system which enables protected software to be distributed in a universal protected format and then be automatically tailored for the uniquely different protection algorithm by the user s computer in accordance with a unique tailoring program. Still one more object of the present invention is to provide a software protection system which protects a predetermined small yet key portion of the program, leaving major subroutines available for tailoring by each user. These objects are accomplished in a software protection system which includes a data transformation circuit and an address transformation circuit which are selectively enabled by a transformation enable circuit. The transformation enable circuit is initially activated by a program instruction which will normally be one of the first instructions in an encoded program. Once activated, the transformation enable circuit monitors the flow of data and addresses between the central processing unit of the computer and the computer main memory. Data and addresses which fall within a segment of memory defined by the transformation enable instruction undergo transformation, while data and addresses which fall outside said segment remain unaffected. The circuitry of the present invention has the advantage of relatively low cost and ease of emplacement in both new and existing computers, yet it provides a high level of protection and is effectively transparent to the user when non encoded software is in use. These and other objects, advantages, and features of the present invention will be further understood and appreciated from a consideration of the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment, presented with the accompanying drawings. In the drawings Figure 1 is a simplified block drawing depicting the logical interrelationships among the various circuit elements of the present invention. Figure 2 is a more detailed block diagram of the major electrical components comprising the present invention. Figure 3A is a detailed block diagram of the major electrical components which comprise the operation code detector circuit of the present invention. Figure 3B is a detailed block diagram of the major electrical components which comprise the bi directional data transformation circuit of the present invention. Figures 4A and 4B are timing diagrams which show the control sequences of the various circuits of the present invention. An improved programmable digital computer system 20 which incorporates the principles of the present invention is best understood by reference to the simplified block diagram of Figure 1. The system 20 includes a prior art central processing unit CPU 40 and random access memory RAM 48, and the circuitry of the present invention.Although the CPU 40 may comprise a type 6502 monolithic integrated circuit microprocessor made by MOS Technology,Inc., 950 Rittenhouse Road, Norristown, Pennsylvania, 19401, and by other second sources, and operates with a word length of eight binary digits bits , it will be apparent that the principles of this invention may be applied to other CPU s with other word lengths with equal success. As can be seen in Figure 1, CPU 40 communicates with RAM 48 through data transform circuit 41 and address transform circuit 43. Both transform circuits are active only when enabled by transform enable circuit 25. When disabled, data passes through data transform circit 41 and addresses pass through address transform circuit 43 in a completely unaffected manner, so that CPU 40 is able to operate normally with non encoded software. Data transform circuit 41 is bi directional, i.e., when it is enabled, encoded data flowing from RAM 48 to CPU 40 is decoded, and non encoded data flowing from CPU 40 to RAM 48 is encoded. Data flow direction through data transform circuit 41 is controlled by the read write R W signal generated by CPU 40 and put out over the line 136. The lowest addressable unit of storage in RAM 48 comprises eight bits, commonly referred to as a byte. Since address transform circuit 43 operates to transform only the lower eight bits of the sixteen bit address used by CPU 40, the address scrambling caused by the transformation process occurs within 256 byte intervals. The size of said interval is controlled by the number of address bits which are scrambled thus if address transform circuit 43 were made to operate on the lower seven bits of the sixteen bit address used by CPU 40, the address scrambling would occur within 128 byte intervals. Since the address space within which scrambling occurs may consist of many contiguous intervals, interval size does not present a maximum limitation to the range of addresses which may be protected.Rather, interval size is important in establishing the minimum address space which may be protected. The upper and lower addresses which define the contiguous address space within which transformation is to occur are set dynamically during program execution. As already noted, the transform circuits 41 and 43 are enabled by transform enable circuit 25. The conditions under which transform enable circuit 25 will put out a transform enable signal over line 130 are determined by operation code detector 22 and boundary address latch 23. Operation code detector 21 is connected to data bus 110 and to instruction fetch line 110 and system clock line 118. Each time a signal is put out by CPU 40 over instruction fetch line 116, operation code detector 21 examines the value on data bus 110 to see if it matches a predetermined operation code. If a match is detected, operation code detectot 22 stores the next two values put out over data bus 110 into the upper and then the lower boundary address latches in boundary address latch 23. Note that the upper and lower boundary addresses stored in boundary address latch 23 each comprise eight bits. Transform enable circuit 25 continuously samples the eight high order address bits on address bus 112 to see whether a given address put out over bus 112 falls within the upper and lower limits set in boundary address latch 23. When this condition is met, and when it is also true that the address of the last operation code sent over data bus 110 fell within the upper and lower limits set in boundary address latch 23, a transform enable signal is put out over line 130. Transform enable circuit 25 knows when an address on bus 112 is an operation code address by also monitoring the instruction fetch signal put out by CPU 40 over line 116. When a system reset occurs, as, for example, when the system 20 is powered on, the boundary addresses in boundary address latch 25 are both set to zero. This effectively quiesces any transform operations, since no possible address on address bus 112 will cause transform enable circuit 25 to put out a transform enable signal over line 130. A user of system 20 can threfore use the system to run non encoded software and to develop personalized software without knowledge of the operation or even the presence of the data transformation circuitry. RAM 48 in Figure 1 depicts a non encoded program A loaded at hexadecimal hex address location 2000 and extending to hex address location 4000, and a protected program B loaded at hex address 6000 and extending to hex address location 8000. The protected segment of program B, represented by the shaded area in the drawing, falls between the hex address locations 6000 and 7000 within RAM 48. One of the first instructions in the program B will comprise an operation code followed by two 8 bit words which will activate operation code detector 21 and boundary address latch 23, causing the hex value 70 to be stored in the upper boundary address latch and the hex value 60 to be stored in the lower boundary address latch.Any time data is thereafter caused to be fetched from or stored into RAM 48 at an address location which falls between hex 6000 and hex 7000 by an operation code which is itself resident within the protected segment, transform enable circuit 25 activates transform circuits 41 and 43. Neither the portion of program B which lies outside the protected area, nor any portion of program A which may be concurrently resident inRAM 48, is affected by the transform operations. Should an attempt be made to load and run programB on a computer system which either does not include the required data transform circuitry to decode the protected segment of program B, or which includes data transform circuitry not matched to the encoding key unique to each individual copy of program B, the computer system will encounter nonsensical instructions and addresses, thereby preventing execution of program B. The invention thus accomplishes its primary object of providing protection for encoded software while at the same time allowing for the full and unencumbered use of the system 20 with non encoded software. The ability to set the upper and lower boundary addresses by means of a program instruction provides protection flexibility, since the size and location of the protected program segment can be varied dynamically according to individual program needs. When a protected program terminates, it can disable any further transformation by setting upper and lower boundary addresses to zero, or it can force the user to terminate the program by executing a system reset, which accomplishes the same result. For ease of presentation, the more detailed description of the circuitry of system 20 which follows is organized by functional groups. Reference is made to Figure 2. The system 20 operates to transform data and addresses of data stored within program defined address boundaries. The upper and lower boundary addresses are defined to and stored by the system 20 in the boundary latch circuit, comprising operation code detector 22, upper boundary latch 24, and lower boundary latch 26. The operation code detector 22 is explained with reference to Figure 3A. Each time CPU 40 reads an operation code from RAM 48, the instruction fetch signal on line 116 goes high, causing D flip flop 52 to set the signal on line 120 to the state of line 118. Line 118 is the output of 8 bit comparator 50, which compares the contents on data bus 110 with a predetermined stored value, and which sets the state of line 118 high when the value on the data bus 110 equals said predetermined stored value. Thus for line 120 to go high, two events must occur CPU 40 must issue an instruction fetch command, and the resulting operation code placed on data bus 110 by RAM 48 must equal the predetermined value stored in 8 bit comparator 50. When line 120 is set high, cycle counter 54 is enabled. The operation code which causes line 120 to go high also causes CPU 40 to fetch two 8 bit words from RAM 48. Coincident with each fetch, CPU 40 generates a clock pulse on line 118. The pulses on line 118, together with the enabling signal on line 120, cause the cycle counter 54 first to set line 104 high and line 102 low, and then to set line 102 high and line 104 low. When line 104 is set high, lower boundary latch 26 is enabled and the data byte present on data bus 110 is stored and put out on data bus 108. Bus 108 will retain this value until the event sequence is repeated causing a new value to be stored in lower boundary latch 26, or until lower boundary latch 26 is cleared by aRESET signal on line 100.Similarly, upper boundary latch 24 is enabled when line 102 is set high, and the data byte present on data bus 110 is put out and remains on data bus 106 until a new value is caused to be stored or upper boundary latch 26 is cleared by a RESET signal on line 100. The high order eight bits of any address put out by CPU 40 over the 16 bit address bus comprising bus 112 and bus 114 are directed to the 8 bit comparators 28 and 30.Upper range comparator 28 has the additional input of bus 106 from upper boundary latch 24, and lower range comparator 30 has the additional input of bus 108 from lower boundary latch 26. Upper range comparator 28 sets output line 122 high if the latched address value on bus 106 is greater than the high order address value on bus 112. Lower range comparator 30 sets output 124 high if the latched address value on bus 108 is less than the high order address value on bus 112. Thus when the value on bus 112 is both less than the upper boundary address stored in upper boundary latch 24 and greater than the lower boundary address stored in lower boundary latch 26, lines 122 and 124 are set high.Lines 122 and 124 feed into AND gate 32 when 122 and 124 are high, line 126 is set high. Line 126 therefore is set high only when the high order address on bus 112 falls between the upper and lower boundary addresses stored in boundary latches 24 and 26. The output of AND gate 32 feeds into D flip flop 34 and into AND gate 36. D flip flop 32 is clocked by the instruction fetch signal generated by CPU 40 and put out over line 116. This arrangement causes the ENCODE ENABLE output of gate 36 on line 130 to be set high when an instruction fetch signal is generated by CPU 40 for an instruction stored within the address range defined by the upper and lower boundary addresses stored in the upper and lower boundary latches 24 and 26. The latching characteristic of D flip flop 34 will also cause any subsequent address put out by CPU 40 to set the ENCODEENABLE output of gate 36 high, regardless of the state of the instruction fetch signal on line 116, providing that the address falls within the range defined by the upper and lower boundary addresses stored in the upper and lower boundary latches 24 and 26.This condition will remain true until an operation code is fetched by CPU 40 from an address in RAM 48 which falls outside the range defined by upper and lower boundary latches 24 and 26. The ENCODE ENABLE signal generated by gate 36 controls both the data transformation circuitry and the address transformation circuitry, as will be explained later. It can be understood at this time, however, that the design of the encode enable circuitry has the following salient characteristics as depicted in Figures 4A and 4B the ENCODE ENABLE signal on line 130 can only be set high by an operation code which resides within the boundary address range defined by upper and lower boundary latches 24 and 26, i.e., by an operation code which is itself encoded. once the ENCODE ENABLE signal on line 130 has been set high, any subsequent data put out or read in by CPU 40 residing at an address location which falls within the boundary address range defined by upper and lower boundary latches 24 and 26 will undergo transformation by the data transformation circuitry. Equally important, data put out or read in by CPU 40 which falls outside said boundary address range will not undergo transformation. An encoded operation code can therefore reference both encoded and nonencoded data. once the ENCODE ENABLE signal on line 130 has been set high, any subsequent address put out by CPU 40 which falls within the boundary address range defined by upper and lower boundary latches 24 and 26 will undergo transformation by the address transformation circuitry. Equally important, addresses put out by CPU 40 which falls outside said boundary address range will not undergo transformation. An encoded operation code can therefore reference both encoded and non encoded addresses. once the ENCODE ENABLE signal on line 130 has been set low, no subsequent data put out or read in by CPU 40, regardless of its address, will undergo transformation by the data transformation circuitry. A non encoded operation code can therefore reference encoded data, although this is not recommended. once the ENCODE ENABLE signal on line 130 has been set low, no subsequent address put out by CPU 40, regardless of its value, will undergo transfÏrmation by the address transformation circuitry. A non encoded operation code can therefore reference an address within the address range defined by the upper and lower boundary latches 24 and 26, although this is not recommended. The bi directional data transformation circuit comprises ROM 42 and bi directional gate 38. It can be seen in Figure 2 that data flows between CPU 40 and RAM 48 only through bi directional gate 38, regardless of the data flow direction. Bi directonal gate 38 is explained with reference to Figure 3B. Each of the individual gates depicted in bidirectional gate 38 actually represents eight identical gates, one for each bit of the 8 bit buses 110, 134, and 138. Bi directional gate 38 is controlled by the signal on line 132, which is the inverted value of the signal on line 130. Line 132 is one input to each of the 8 NOR gates 56 the other input to each NOR gate 56 is one bit from the 8 bit bus 136 from ROM 42. When the ENCODE ENABLE signal of line 130 is low, i.e., data is not to be transformed, the signal on line 132 is high. This will force the output of each NOR gate 56 to be low, so that all 8 bits of bus 140 will be low. When the ENCODE ENABLE signal of line 130 is high, i.e., data is to be transformed, the signal on line 132 is low.This will cause the output bit of each NOR gate 56, which bits together comprise bus 140, to be the inverse of each corresponding input bit from bus 138. Bus 140 feeds into the 2 sets of 8 exclusive OR gates 60 and 68. When all 8 bits of bus 140 are low, i.e., when ENCODE ENABLE is low, the exclusive OR gates 60 will cause the bus 144 to contain the same value as exists on bus 142. Similarly, bus 150 will contain the same value as exists on bus 148. Thus data which enters bi directional gate 38 on bus 110 will flow in through gates 60 and out on bus 144 to bus 146 to bus 134 in a completely unaffected manner, and data which enters bi directional gate 38 on bus 134 will flow in through gates 68 and out on bus 150 to bus 152 to bus 110, and will likewise remain unaffected. The direction of data flow is determined by the read write R W signal generated by CPU 40 and put out over line 136. When the R W signal is high, indicating a read operation, the signal will cause inhibit gates 64 to allow data to pass freely from bus 150 to bus 152, and thus to bus 110. The same R W signal will pass through inverter 58 to inhibit gates 62, causing these gates to block the flow of data from bus 144 to bus 146. When the R W signal is inverted by CPU 40 to indicate a write operation, gates 64 inhibit data flow from bus 150 to 152, and gates 62 allow data flow from bus 144 to 146. When ENCODE ENABLE is high, line 132 will be low.As noted earlier, this will cause bus 140 to carry the inverted values of the corresponding bits comprising bus 138. These inverted values participate in exclusive OR operations with the corresponding bits of buses 142 or 148 in gates 60 or 68, respectively, depending on the direction of data flow as determined by the R W signal over line 132 from CPU 40. Thus ENCODE ENABLE will cause data flowing through bi directional gate 38 from bus 110 to bus 134, or from bus 134 to bus 110, to undergo an exclusive OR operation with the inverted value of bus 138. The value of the data carried on bus 138 is determined in the following manner ROM 42 contains eight addressable tables, each consisting of 256 addressable bytes of data. When data is to be read from or written to RAM 48 by CPU 40, the address of the data is put out by CPU 40 over address buses 112 and 114. Three bits of the high order address bus 112 are selected and passed to ROM 42 on bus 156, and all eight bits of the low order address bus 114 are passed to ROM 42 on bus 158. The three bits of bus 156 are used to select one of the eight tables stored in ROM 42, and the eight bits of bus 158 are used to select one of the 256 bytes from the selected table. The value thus selected is put out on bus 138 to the bi directional gate 38. The address transformation circuit comprises ROM 44, inverter 70, and gates 72 and 74. ROM 44 is operated in a manner identical to the operation of ROM 42 described in connection with the data transformation circuit three bits of the high order address bus 112 and all eight bits of the low order address bus 114 are passed to ROM 44 on buses 156 and 158 respectively. The three bits on bus 156 are used to select from among eight tables stored in ROM 44, and the eight bits on bus 158 are used to select from among the 256 bytes of data comprising each of the eight tables. The byte so selected is put out on bus 160 to a selector circuit comprising the gates 72 and 74. When an address is generated by CPU 40 for either a read or a write operation, the high order bits of the address pass directly to RAM 48 on address bus 112. The low order bits may also pass directly to RAM 48, or a substitution value may pass to RAM 48 instead, depending on the state of gates 72 and 74. The substitution value, if chosen, is the output value of ROM 44 as hereinbefore described. Line 130, carrying the ENCODE ENABLE signal, is fed directly to inhibit gate 74 and is fed indirectly through inverter 70 to inhibit gate 72. When ENCODE ENABLE is high, inhibit gate 72 is disabled, allowing the output of RAM 44 to pass over bus 160 to bus 162. Simultaneously, inhibit gate 74 is enabled, blocking transmission of low order address bus 114 to bus 162. The address which reaches RAM 48 will therefore consist of a non transformed high order byte and a transformed low order byte. When ENCODE ENABLE is low, inhibit gate 72 is enabled and inhibit gate 74 is disabled, thus causing the address passed to RAM 48 to consist of the non transformed high and low order bytes of buses 112 and 114, respectively. Having thus described an embodiment of the invention, it will now be appreciated that the objects of the invention have been fully achieved, and it will be understood by those skilled in the art that many changes in construction and circuitry and widely differing embodiments and applications of the invention will suggest themselves without departure from the spirit and scope of the invention. The disclosures and the description herein are purely illustrative and are not intended to be in any sense limiting. The features disclosed in the foregoing description, in the following claims and or in the accompanying drawings may, both separately and in ny combination thereof, be material for realising the invention in diverse forms thereof.
