# Automatic return hinge.

## Abstract
In an automatic return hinge of the rising butt type the rise on opening a door to which the hinge is fitted is developed by three balls seated in one half of the hinge which traverse three corresponding helical grooves in the other half of the hinge. The grooves may be in the axle rod of the hinge. In a self adjusting hinge suitable for use in conjunction with the return hinge, the axle rod of the hinge is attached to one half of the hinge and passes through a rotatable ball seated in the other half of the hinge. Rotation of the ball carrying the axle rod corrects any misalignment of the axle rod with the other hinge.
