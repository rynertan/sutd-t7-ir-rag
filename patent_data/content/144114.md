# Ultrasonic separation apparatus.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic separation apparatus is disclosed which provides simultaneous cutting and sealing of thermoplastic materials. Both relatively thin and thick materials may be cut and sealed. The apparatus includes a cutting mechanism 52 having a cutting blade 84 mounted for oscillatory move ment along its longitudinal axis. Cutting takes place at a controlled rate to allow sufficient time for simultaneous sealing to occur. The apparatus may be particularly adapted for cutting strings of pocketed coil springs to length.
