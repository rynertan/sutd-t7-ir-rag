# Wheeled working vehicle with crane.

## Abstract
In a working vehicle including a crane 21 for handling loads and a driver s cab 11 , both crane and cab are rotatably mounted on the vehicle, each about its vertical axis, and controlled such that a turning angle beta of the crane results in a turning angle alpha of the cab, alpha being an optional function of beta, e.g. half of beta. The driver can thus carry out all the working operations desired for the crane without having to turn his head uncomfortably.
