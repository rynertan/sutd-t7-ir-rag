The following Examples 1 through 4 are illustrative of the preparation of certain specific antidotal compounds of this invention. Example 1 Preparation of N 2, 2 dimethoxyethyl N 2 propenyl 2, 2 dichloroacetamide A three neck flask was placed in an ice bath and charged with 2.9 grams 0.02 mole of N 2,2 dinethoxyethyl amine, and 2.02 grams 0.02 mole of triethylamine in 100 milliliters of methylene chloride.To this stirred mixture, a solution of 2.95 grams 0.02 mole of dichloroacetyl chloride in 5 milliliters of methylene chloride was added dropwise over a period of 15 minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred for onehalf hour, removed from the ice bath, and stirred for an additional three hours, by which tine the reaction mixture had reached ambient temperature. The reaction mixture was then washed with a 50 milliliter portion of 10 percent aqueous hydrochloric acid solution, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator at a temperature not in excess of 500C., yielding 4.96 grams of a pale pink liquid identified by NMR spectroscopy as N 2, 2 dimethoxyethyl N 2 propenyl 2,2 dichloroacetamide. Example 2 Preparation of N 2, 2 dimethoxyethyl N l methylethyl 2,2 dichloroacetamide When the procedure described in Example 1 was followed reacting 2.21 grams 0.015 mole of N l methylethyl N dinethoxyethyl amine, 1 52 grams 0.015 mole of triethylaniineand 2.21 grams 0.015 mole of dichloroacetyl chloride, 3.74 grams of a pale yellow oil was obtained, which was identified by NHR spectroscopy as N 2,2 dimethoxyethyl N l methylethyl 2, 2 dichloroacetamide.

The mode of synthesis of specific compounds of this invention has been illustrated in some detail by the foregoing Examples but it is to be understood that any compound contemplated to be within the scope of this invention may be prepared by those skilled in the art simply by varying the choice of starting materials and use of the illustrated techniques or other suitable techniques. The compounds prepared as described in Examples 1 through 4 as well as other compounds within the scope of this invention are useful in reducing phytotoxic damage caused by active herbicides to growing crops, especially corn. The active herbicides which tend to phytotoxically damage corn, when used in herbicidally effective amount against weeds growing among the corn crop, are S alkyl thiocarbamate type herbicides or chloroacetanilide type herbicides, particularly the former.Exemplary of some S alkyl thiocarbamate type herbicides are S ethyl diethylthiocarbamate, S ethyl diisobutylthiocarbamate, S ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate, andS propyl dipropylthiocarbamate whereas 2 chloro 2 ,6 diethyl N methoxymethyl acetanalide, 2 chloro N isopropylacetanilide, 2 chloro N,N diallylacetamide, N chloroacetyl N 2,6 diethylphenyl glycine ethyl ester, 2 chloroN 2 ethyl 6 methylphenyl N 2 nethoxy l methylethyl acetamide, and 2 chloro 2 , 3 dimethyl N methoxymethyl acetanilide are examples of some chloroacetanilide type herbicides. The S alkyl thiocarbamate herbicides or chloroacetanilide herbicides are typically incorporated into the soil or growth medium prior to crop seeding, which technique is commonly referred to as pre plant incorporation. The antidotal compounds of this invention may be separately incorporated into the soil but are preferably formulated or composited with theS alkyl thiocarbamate herbicide or the chloroacetanilide herbicide. In either case, sufficient of the antidotal compounds of this invention are present such that the weight ratio of herbicide to compound of this invention is in the range of 18 1 to 6 1, the herbicide, of course, being present in herbicidal amount, which depending on the weed species, may varyover a wide range.Typically the herbicide is used in amounts ranging from 0.56 or less kilogram per hectare 0.5 pound per acre to 11.2 or more kilograms per hectare 10 pounds per acre . It is to be further understood that mixtures of S alkyl thiocarbamate herbicides and chloroacetanilide herbicides as well as mixtures of compounds of this invention may be used In addition, the herbicideantidotal compound formulations of this invention may contain other agronomically acceptable adjuvants such as inert carriers, herbicides other than S alkyl thiocarbamates or chloroacetanilides, or other commonly used agricultural compounds, for example, pesticides, stabilizers, fertilizers, soil life.extending agents, and the like. The compounds of this invention, whether used as such or in formulation with other materials, may be applied to the soil in the form of dusts, granules, wettable powders, solutions, suspensions, aerosols, emulsions, dispersions, or the like in a manner well known to the art. The following Example 5 is illustrative of the antidotal effect exhibited by the compounds of this invention in protecting Funk s G 4288 hybrid field corn from the phytotoxic damage caused by a commercial herbicide, namely, S ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate commonly referred to asEPTC . Example 5 a Pulverized, sandy loam topsoil and coarse, washed cement sand screened to pass a 0.475 centimeter mesh screen were mixed in a weight ratio of three parts of soil to one part of sand, and the mix was pasteurized with live steam to kill any plants, pathogenic organisms, and natural weed seed populations. Shallow containers, commonly referred to as. flats , were filled within 0.95 centimeter of the top with the pasteurized soil mixture, leveled but not firmed, and were passed under a sprayer equipped with a fixed fan nozzle suspended over a movable belt with speed adjustment.The fan nozzle operated at about 2800 grams per square centimeter air pressure, delivering 25 milliliters of distilled water in 4.6 seconds.At 25.4 centimeters above the soil surface, a 45.7 centimeter wide spray pattern was applied. The belt speed was adjusted so as to travel 76.2 centimeters per revolution in 8.3 seconds. The soil test containers passed under the nozzle within 4.6 seconds. The area covered in this time was 0.63 square meters. The volume of liquid delivered was equivalent to 400 liters per hectare and 0.7029 gram of a 100 percent active test com pound per 0.63 square meter was equivalent to an application rate of 11.2 kilograms of active test compound per hectare. The carrier solvent used for the S alkyl thiocarbamate, i.e.,EPTC, and the particular antidotal compound was a 90 8 2 volume volume mixture of acetone methanol dimethylformamide. After the test container was sprayed with the test compound or mixture of compounds, it was immediately emptied into a clean plastic bag, the top secured, and the contents throughly mixed by hand agitation of the plastic bag, and the contents were then emptied back into the test container. The soil was then leveled, firmed, and seeded with Funk s G 4288 Hybrid Field Corn, and the soil mixture covered with a 2.54 centimeter layer of pasteurized screened sand. The treated flats were then transferred to the plant growth room, where they were lightly watered overhead as required to insure growth.The plant growth room was illuminated with a light intensity that averaged 27,000 lumens. per square meter at the growth level. The growth room was maintained at 2900. to 300C. during the 16 hour photo period, and 200 C. to 230C. at night. The relative humidity of the growth room when less than one third full averaged from 50 to 55 percent. The treated flats were allowed to grow and injury, if any, to the corn was determined by visual inspection periodically thereafter.Injury was noted as reduction in growth, and or as hormonal distortion as compared with an untreated control. This hormonal injury is manifested as a distortion of the growing apex of the stem due to the failure of the developing leaves to unfurl from the growing shoot. Continued apical growth results in a compaction and distortion of the subapical tissues until a break is caused in the surrounding leaf tissue. Hormonal injury may occur in the initial seedling stages of growth when high concentrations of S alkyl thiocarbamate has been applied or at later growth stages with lower concentrations of the herbicide. The distortion may not appear until the growing apex of the stem is above the soil line or may not appear until the apex divides and begins formation of the pistillate ir florescens. Hormonal injury may also weaken the prop root system so as to cause the whole plant to collapse of its own weight. b When EPTC S ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate was applied by pre plant incorporation as described in paragraph a at a rate of 6.72 kilograms per hectare with no antidotal compound added, as described, the corn showed a 90 percent injury as indicated by a reduction in growth and hormonal distortion after 14 days, 25 days, 28 days, and 42 days. In addition, after 42 days, necrosis also developed to contribute to the injury of the corn crop. c When EPTC at a rate of 6.72 kilograms per hectare and N 2, 2 dimethoxyethyl N 2 propenyl 2,2dichloroacetamide prepared as described in Example 1 at a rate of 0.56 kilograms per hectare, that is, a ratio of 12 parts by weight of EPTC to one part by weight of antidotal compound, were applied by pre plant incorporation as described in paragraph a , the corn crop, after 42 days, was completely healthy and normal and showed no signs of growth reduction or hormonal distortion. d When EPTC at a rate of 6.72 kilograms per hectare and N 1, 3 dioxolan 2 ylmethyl N 2 propenyl 2, 2 dichloroacetamide prepared as described in Example 4 at 1.12 kilograms per hectare, that is, a ratio of 6 parts by weight of EPTC to one part by weight of antidotal compound, were applied by pre plant incorporation as described in paragraph a , the corn crop, after 42 days, was completely healthy and normal and showed no signs of growth reduction or hormonal distortion. Although the invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to specific illustrative embodiments thereof, it is not intended that the invention be so limited except as set forth in the appended claims.
