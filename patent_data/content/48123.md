## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION GELLED ALGIN EMULSIONSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is known that the alginates react with certain metal cations, most notably with calcium ions, to produce products which are gels, water insoluble fibers, or fibers. Industrial Gums, R. 35Whistler, 2nd ed., Academic Press 1973, pp 56 57 .The various products produced utilizing this reaction have included, e.g., meat analog systems U. S. Pat.3,919,435 , artificial adipose tissue U. S. Pat.3,658,550 , and food coatings U. S. Pat. 3,395,024 and 3,991,218 .SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that gels prepared from algin emulsions containing emulsifiers and oils or fats can be used as coatings or films which exhibit improved barrier properties or can be utilized in preparing impression molds with enhanced unmolding properties and impression detail. The gels are prepared by treating the algin emulsions with di or tri valent metal ions. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The algins useful in this invention are the water soluble salts of alginic acid. Algin is found in all species of Phaeopyceae. The preferred forms are sodium, potassium, and ammonium alginates and the ester, propylene glycol alginate. The algins are commercially available e.g., KELCOLOID , KELGIN , KELMAR , KELCOGEL , etc. from KelcoDivision of Merck Co., Inc., San Diego, California. The metal ions can be provided by various means, however, a readily water soluble salt of calcium, preferably CaC12, in aqueous solution is most desired. It will be recognized that other divalent and trivalent metal ions could be used in the practice of this invention but when the end product is to be used in humans or animals, calcium ions are preferred. Sources of calcium ions include, but are not limited to calcium acetate monohydrate , calcium phosphate anhycrous, and monohydrate , dicalcium phosphate diltydrate, and anhydrous , tricalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate dihydrate, and anhydrous , calcium gluconate, calcium lactate, calcium citrater and calcium tartrate. The emulsifiers useful in this invention are those which contain both lipophilic and hydrophilic groups. Preferably, the emulsifiers are liquid at room temperature. Specific examples of such emulsifiers are acetylated monoglycerides, lecithin, monoglycerides, diglycerides, and their derivatives, polyglycerol esters of fatty acids, polyglycerol oleates, and blends of the above emulsifiers. Preferred are the acetylated monoglycerides, Myvacet 9 45 and Myvacet 9 40 E. Kodak . The gelled algin emulsions of this invention also contain fats or oils. These are preferbly liquid or have a smooth, plastic texture at room temperature. They include oils from vegetables e.g., corn, olive, and soy , seeds e.g., cotton, sunflower, and linseed , legumes e.g., peanut , nuts e.g., almond and palm kernel , fats from animal sources e.g., lard, butter, tallow, and fish , hydrogenated oils e.g., shortenings , and mineral oil. The concentrations of the ingredients can be varied depending on the properties desired in the final product. Generally, the following amounts are used based on finished product wt wt. Algin 0.05 5.0 Emulsifier 0.05 25.0 Oil fat 0.05 20.0 Metal ions 0.0001 0.50High levels of emulsifier and oil fat will improve barrier properties, in general, but an excess will decrease the gel strength of the continuous phase, which will decrease the strength of the films or coatings. The gelled algin emulsions of this invention may also contain various optional ingredients such as 1. Texture modifiers fillers dextrins more turbid , sugars more brittle , syrups stickier and softer , starches more turbid and less brittle , milk solids, diatomaceous earth, clay, and other soluble and insoluble solids. 2. Buffers e.g. sodium citrate . 3. Sequestrants e.g., TSPP, sodium hexametaphosphate, and sodium phosphate . It is essential, if using water containing polyvalent metal ions to prepare the algin solution, to use a sequestrant to prevent premature cross linking of the algin solution. 4. Wetting agents for better spreadability for film casting and to form finer emulsions. A preferred agent is dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate DSS , which is waxy at room temperature. DSS is available from American Cyanamid Pearl River, N.Y. . It is also available as Complemix, a U.S.P. 50 aqueous beverage grade ethanol solution. 5. Flavoring and coloring agents. These optional ingredients are preferably added in the following procedure prior to the addition of the emulsifier. The gelled algin emulsions are prepared by 1 Making an aqueous algin solution. 2 Making an oil fat water emulsion. This is done by slowly adding oil fat into the algin solution under high shear. 3 Adding thereto the emulsifier under high shear. The emulsifier is added after the emulsion is formed. 4 When a very fine emulsion is desired, homogenation or colloid milling is recommended. The emulsion may require de aeration. 5 Making an aqueous divalent or trivalent metal ion solution. A 5 by weight CaC12 anhy. solution works well, although solutions in the range of 0.5 10 may be used. 6 Combining the emulsion and ion solutions. The gelling procedure addition of the calcium solution to the emulsion will vary depending on the product to be formed. The general procedure for preparing coatings or films is to first apply the emulsion followed by the application of the ion solution or the ion solution first followed by the emulsion . If it is desired to use only a one application procedure, a slowly dissolving calcium salt may be mixed with the emulsion. This mix is then used to prepare the film or coating. The rate of dis solution may be enchanced by the use of fumeric, adipic, citric, or like acids. The coating of this invention can be applied by any of various means. The specific method would depend largely on the nature and size of the object being coated. A revolving pan can be used with or without forced heated air. The calcium solution is sprayed on the object, followed by spraying the algin emulsions. This can be done in reverse order. A second calcium solution may be sprayed over the algin emulsion or the entire sequence can be repeated to build up thickness. As an alternative to spraying the object may be dipped. Films, which differ from coatings in that they are flat rather than contoured about an object, are prepared by casting the algin emulsion on a planar surface preferably clean and smooth and spraying with the calcium solution, followed by drying. Alternatively, an algin emulsion can be cast containing slowly dissolving calcium salts and slowly dissolving acids fumaric, adipic . Or an algin emulsion is cast which contains slowly dissolving calcium salts. This is sprayed with an acidic solution e.g., mild citric or other acids . Casting can be done by a hand casting bar, a mechanically driven film applicator, a film casting knife, or a continuous casting bar. After drying the film can be rolled, cut, etc., for subsequent use as a flexible packaging wrap as for food, pharmaceuticals, or any other items where a protective water or air barrier is necessary. Algin emulsions containing slowly dissolving calcium salts can be poured onto impression molds and allow to set. The impression molds made from gelled algin emulsions exhibit improved unmolding properties, have a more elastic texture, show greater detail and dry slower than regular algin calcium molds. The substantially continuous coating of this invention finds applications in many industries. Of particular importance is the food industry, where it is usually desired to either keep moisture in, e.g.to retard dehydration, or to keep moisture out so as to retard spoilage, loss of color, flavor, etc. The following is a listing of suggested uses for such a coating.1. Prepared meat products sa lsages, extruded meat snacks such as beef jerky, meatballs, pet foods, etc. . a. Good water, oxygen barrier properties for reducing dehydration and oxidative flavor degradation b. relatively poor fat barrier which is desirable for fat release during cooking c. colors, flavors water soluable and or oil soluble can be trapped in the coating d. coating is easily applied to different shapes and becomes part of the product as a skin e. barrier properties water, oxygen and oil can be adjusted easily by changing acetylated monoglyceride, vegetable oil, algin, or water concentrations.2. In fish fresh and frozen , red meat carcass, and poultry salmon, beef, pork and lamb carcass, pre cut steaks, chicken, turkey, etc. a. Water, oxygen barrier properties for reducing drip loss, surface microbial contamination, oxidative flavor degradation, freezer burn and dehydration.3. In cheeses and cheese products individually wrapped cheeses, soft texture cheese, extruded cheese snacks, loaf or block cheeses, etc. a. Replaces wax coating less labor intensive, no cracking of wax and no peeling off b. retains desirable shapes for soft cheeses as an edible packaging material c. reduces dehydration and oxidative flavor degradation of cheese products which are usually not waxed.4. Fruits and vegetables fresh, frozen and dehydrated frozen fruits and vegetables, blueberries, bananas, cucumbers, apples, tomatoes . a. Prevents freezer burn and oxidative flavor degradation and discoloration of frozen fruits and vegetables b. replaces wax coatings c. extends freshness of fresh fruits and vegetables for which wax cannot be used, ir. conjunction with controlled atmosphere storage d. flexibiiity, allowing incorporation of fungicides, antioxidants e.g. bananas, dehydrated figs, etc. e. retains shape and gives extra rigidity to delicate and soft textured fruits and vegetables e.g. blueberries, cherries, grapes, tomatoes, etc. .5. Confections e.g., liquid center type candies . a. Retains viscous solutions inside confections, whether introduced as liquids or as sucar invertase enzyme mixtures which subsequently become liquid due to enzyme action b. the coating becomes part of the candy as well as a packaging material c. other wrappers e.g., aluminum laminates , or additional coatings e.g., Shellac or sugar coatings can be applied over the algin emulsion calcium coating.6. Pharmaceutical products a. Useful as a subcoating prior to pan coating of tablets or pills b. enteric coatings, sustained release pills, etc. c. liquid containing pharmaceutical candies such as cough syrups, mouth freshner, etc.. 7. Edible flexible packaging film for other food products and pharmaceuticals.
