# FLUID INJECTORS

## Abstract
A fluid injector 1 for an oil fuel burner suitable for firing the fuel of a boiler includes an injection device 2 which can be inserted into the wall of the boiler to an operating position at which oil discharge can be safely permitted and with drawn from that operating position for inspection and servicing. A flow control valve 3 of the fluid injector 1 is adapted for connection to an oil fuel and delivery circuit and is mounted in a fixed position relative to the boiler wall. The fluid injector 1 also includes a fluid coupling device 11 between the injection device 2 and the flow control valve 3. The fluid coupling device includes male and female termin als 19 and 20, respectively, which are fast with the injection device 2 and the flow control valve 3, respectively. The male and female terminals 19 and 20 are disconnected as the injection device 2 is withdrawn whilst the change over valve remains mounted to the boiler wall and connected to the oil fuel and return circuit, at which time the female terminal 20 isolates that circuit from the withdrawn injection device 2 and seals flow from the circuit within itself. When the injection device 2 is inserted to its operating position, the male terminal 19 interconnects with the female terminal 20 to communicate the oil fuel and delivery circuit with the injection device 2 through the flow control valve 3. The flow control valve 3 may provide a direct flow path through itself when the injection device 2 is withdrawn to allow oil to circulate continuously in the oil fuel and delivery circuit at that time.
