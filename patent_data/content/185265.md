# Circular knitting machine, in particular for hose knitting, with continuous cycle lubrication.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a knitting machine, in particular for hose knitting, with continuous cycle lubric tion, which is peculiar in that it comprises a space 1 defined between the needle cylinder 2 and cylinder holder 3 , and in communication with the delivery conduit 4 of a feed pump 5 , delivery ports 7 defined on the needle cylinder 2 for connecting the space 1 to the outside, a collecter pan 10 located in the proximity of the needle cylinder 2 base and supplying an oil collecting case 14 in communication with the feed conduit 21 of the cited pump 5 . The delivery conduit 4 is in communication with the cited space 1 through the needle cylinder 2 bearing 6 and the oil collecting case 14 houses the gear train 15a, 15b, 15c for transmitting the rotary motion to the needle cylinder 2 . The delivery ports 7 are provided on the bottom of the needle cllinder 2 flutes 8 which accommodate the needles and jackes. Thus, thorough and continuous lubrication of the machine main members is achieved.
