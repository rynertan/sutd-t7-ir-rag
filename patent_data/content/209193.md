# Method of switching time slots in a tdm signal and arrangement for performing the method.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a time switching stage for exchanging data words. In switching systems for communication systems the need is sometimes felt for switching what are commonly referred to as multi slot connections. To enable this, the memory capacity of the time switching stage must be doubled. The invention pro vides a method and an arrangement with which multi slot connections are realized without extanding the memory capacity. This accomplished by using an appropriate interleaving of a shift register and a memory.

## Description
The invention relates to a method of switching data words in time slots, the data words being applied in time division multiplex to a time switching stage, and a data word I With the aid of time stages such as are presently used in switching systems for, for example, telephone exchanges, a number N of channels of identical capacities C are switched. To that end the time stage comprises From European Patent Application EP 0012135 it is known to switch data words in the time slots of a PCM frame bit sequentially, the correct time sequence of the bits being obtained by delaying or not delaying the bits through a cycle period in the switching memory. The invention has for its object to provide a method with which in a simple way and in accordance with a novel concept time slots can be exchanged in a bit parallel time switching stage for N channels, the stage requiring a memory capacity of not more than N words and the method being suitable for establishing multi slot connections, without extending the memory capacity. According to the invention, the me thod of exchanging time slots in a tdm signal of the type defined in the opening paragraph is therefore character ized in that the method has the following steps The invention also relates to a time switching stage for performing the method of switching data words, the data words being applied in time division multiplex to the time switching stage and the data words in an incoming frame comprising According to the invention, the time switching stage for performing the method of switching data words, is characterized in that the memory is a random access shift memory, that the time switching stage comprises an address generator for generating the address at which the data word applied to the shift memory is stored and that the time switching stage comprises means for shifting through one address location the content of the memory locations having an address equal to or higher than the generated address. It is advantageous for the random access shift memory to comprise The time switching stage is preferrably arranged such that each cell of the random access shift memory comprises a register, a multiplexer and a comparator arrangement, that the comparator arrangement has a first input coupled to the address input, a second input coupled to an order indicator and an output connected to a control input of the multiplexer, that the multiplexer has a first input connected to an output of the register of the pre ceding cell, a second input coupled to an output of the register of its own cell and a third input connected to the data input, that an output of the multiplexer is connected to the input of the register and that a control input of the register is connected to the clock input. The invention will now be described in greater detail by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, corresponding components in the Figures having being given the same reference symbols. Therein Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of a time switching stage according to the invention. An incoming time division multiplex line TOM Fig. 2 shows by way of example an incoming and an outgoing frame structure. In Fig. 2a one frame is shown on the incoming time division multiplex line TDM A shift memory SRM for use in the time switching system of Fig. 1 is shown in Fig. 3. The shift memory comprises Put differently, the data in the cells to the right of the address itself each shift one cell to the right and data present on the databus is accommodated in the then free, addressed cell. All the cells to the left of the addressed cell are not influenced. The address A s is calculated as follows. The time slots in the frames are numbered from 0 to N 1. For each time slot in the input frame Fig. 2a it is specified in a time slot exchanging Table into which time slot of the output frame Fig. 2b the relevant data word must be entered. At time slot The address applied to the shift memory SRM for time slot Fig. 4a illustrates the time slot exchanging Ta ble. Column 1 of this Table s shows the numbers of the time slots of the input frame as shown in Fig. 2a. Column 2 of the Table D s shows the time slot numbers of the time slots in the output frame as is shown in Fig. 2b. Column 3 of the Table A s shows the addresses as they have been generated by the address generator in accordance with the above rule. This produces the following results it is ascertained at line 1 s 0 D s 3 of the Table that the address applied is equal to 0 A s 0 , as the number of time slots having a time slot number For this same example Fig. 4b shows in what manner the shift memory effects the time slot exchange if the input data shown in Fig. 2a and the addresses of column 3 A s of the Table of Fig. 4a are applied to this memory. At instant t 0 the data in the 0 When the shift memory is completely full, that is to say at the end of a frame in this example at the end of the seventh time slot then there appears at the output of the last cell in the present example cell Câ‚‡ the data word of the 0 Fig. 5 shows a practical embodiment of a shift memory, showing one cell C It is however not necessary for the cell to have an individual comparator arrangement connected to it. It is conceivable that a central comparison arrangement is used for all the cells together. The structure of the shift memory SRM is an appropriate structure for assembling one large SRM, assembl ed from a plurality of smaller memories, so that a time switching stage of basically unlimited dimensions can be build up as one module. The arrangement for exchanging time slots in a tdm signal has the advantages that the required memory capacity can be kept to a minimum, the further required means being of a simple nature and small bulk. It will be obvious that for the principle of the invention it is not important whether, as described in the foregoing, the data words are entered into pre determined addresses and become available in an well ordered sequence at the output DB The method and arrangement may alternatively be utilized for realising a variable, adjustable delay of data words, as, if a fixed address is applied to the address bus A Fig. 3 all the incoming data words will be entered in the cell associated with that address and, after the data words have passed through the remaining cells of the shift memory SRM, will become available at the output DB
