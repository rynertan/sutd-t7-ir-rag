# METHOD FOR DETERMINING OIL SATURATION IN A SUBSURFACE FORMATION

## Abstract
A borehole logging system includes a borehole gravity meter and a resistivity logging tool. A borehole gravity log and a resistivity log are produced over a selected depth interval in a borehole. The bulk density of the subsurface formation surrounding the borehole over the selected depth interval is measured from the gravity log. The bulk resistivity of the formation surrounding the borehole over the selected depth interval is measured from the resistivity log. The bulk density and bulk resistivity measurements are combined to derive a measurement of the residual oil saturation of the subsurface formation surrounding the borehole for the selected depth interval.
