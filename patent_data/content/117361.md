# Picture framing system.

## Abstract
A frame system includes a plurality of elongated frame members 10, 11 joined end to end to enclose a display area and each having an inwardly projecting wall portion 12 for bordering a perimeter of a display piece and a rearwardly projecting, inwardly opening channel 13 having transverse lips 14, 15 spaced apart by an inwardly facing slot 16 . Joining the ends 17 of each pair of con tiguous frame members is a unitary bracket 20 having leg portions 21 disposed at an angle corresponding to the angle between the contiguous members and retained by the channels therein. Each of the leg portions 21 comprises a guide surface defining retainer cavity 23 juxtaposed to one of the slots and retaining a locking cam 25 for securing the frame sections. Comprising each locking cam is a base portion 26 retained by the retainer cavity 23 and movable therein along a path determined by engagement with the guide surface thereof and a latch portion 27 extending into the adjacent slot 16 and movable by the movement of the base portion 26 into forced engagement with one of the channel lips 15 so as to securely latch together the frame member 10, 11 and the leg portion 21 retained thereby.
