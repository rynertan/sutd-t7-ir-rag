# Rotary fluid pressure device and lubrication circuit therefor.

## Abstract
A rotary fluid pressure device is disclosed of the type utilizing a gerotor gear set 13 and an output shaft assembly 45 including a spool valve 49 . The device includes a housing 11 defining inlet and outlet ports 21 and 23 . The spool valve and housing cooperate to define a lubrication fluid chamber 59 . Torque is transmitted from the gerotor set to the output shaft by a dog bone shaft 61 having a rearward spline connection 65, 69 to the gerotor, and a forward spline connection 63, 67 to the output shaft. The spool valve defines a pair of annular grooves 71, 73 in communication with the ports and a pair of check valve assemblies 91, 93 to permit flow of lubrication fluid from the lubrication chamber into whichever of the annular grooves is in communication with the outlet port. The resulting lubrication circuit insures a good flow of lubrication through both of the spline connections, in either direction of operation of the device, and further insures that contamina tion particles are carried from the spine connections to the outlet port without having to pass through severe flow restrictions which can trap such particles.
