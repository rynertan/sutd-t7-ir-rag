## Description
This invention relates to novel mercapto substi tuted 2, 3,4, 5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepines having pharmacodynamic activity. More specifically the compounds of this invention have dopamine receptor blocking activity and therefore are useful as antipsychotic and antiemetic agents. The antipsychotic activity is similar to that of chlorpromazine. The compounds of this invention are represented by the following general structural formula EMI1.1 FORMULA I wherein R represents methyl, allyl, dimethylallyl, phenethyl, cyclopropylmethyl or B hydroxyethyl R1 represents phenyl, m or p substituted phenyl with the substituent being trifluqroadthyl, chloro, methoxy, methyl, fluoro, nitro or hydroxy, cyclohexyl, thienyl, thienylmethyl, furyl or furylmethyl R2 represents hydrogen, methoxy, alkanoyloxy with the alkanoyl moiety having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, or hydroxy, each R2 being the same or different except that when one of R2 is alkanoyloxy the other is hydrogen, methoxy or alkanoyloxy and R3 represents hydrogen, chloro, bromo, trifluoromethyl, fluoro or methyl. Particular compounds of this invention represented by formula I above are when R is methyl, R1 is phenyl, p trifluoromethylphenyl, p chlorophenyl, p tolyl, p fluorophenyl, cyclohexyl or 2 thienyl, both R2 are hydrogen, acetoxy or hydroxy, or one R2 is hydroxy and the other is methoxy, and R3 is hydrogen, chloro or bromo. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts having the utility of the free bases of Formula I, prepared by methods well known to the art, are formed with both inorganic or organic acids, for example maleic, fumaric, benzoic, ascorbic, pamoic, succinic, bismethylenesalicylic, methanesulfonic, ethanedisulfonic, acetic, oxalic, propionic, tartaric, salicylic, citric, gluconic, aspartic, stearic, palmitic, itdconic, glycolic, p aminobenzoic, glutamic, benzenesulfonic, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, cyclohexylsulfamic, phosphoric and nitric acids. U. S. Patents 3,671,519 and 3,483,185 name 2,3,4 ,5 tetrahydro 8 methylmercapto lH 3 benzazepine as a starting material, however neither of these or equivalent prior art discloses the mercapto substituents of formula I above in a 3 benzazepine series. The compounds of formula I wherein both R2 are hydroxy are conveniently prepared from dihydroxy substituted benzazepines as shown in the following scheme EMI2.1 in which R1 is as described above except for hydroxy substituted phenyl . Thus, a 7,8 dihydroxy substituted benzazepine is oxidized, preferably with 2,3 dichloro 5,6dicyano 1,4 benzoquinone DDQ in an inert organic solvent in which the reactants are soluble such as methanol or ethanol, with chilling at about 0 50C. or at ambient temperature until the oxidation is complete. A number of other mild oxidizing agents known to convert catechols to o quinones may be employed such as, for example, silver oxide, ceric ammonium nitrate, chloranil or silver carbonate.The 7,8 dione intermediate is then reacted with the desired mercaptan R1SH in a suitable inert organic solvent such as an alcoholic solvent, methanol or ethanol, at about ambient temperature to give the mercapto substituted product. The hydroxy substituted phenyl products are conveniently obtained from the corresponding methoxy substituted phenyl compounds by treatment with, for example, boron tribromide. Alternatively the above dihydroxy substituted benzazepine starting material, or its dimethyl ether derivative, is brominated to give the 6 bromo compound which is reacted with n butyl lithium and then an appropriate disulfide to give the 6 thio substituted product. The ether groups can be cleaved to hydroxy groups by treatment with 48 hydrobromic acid. The quinone intermediate shown in the above reaction scheme clearly is a valuable intermediate and as such forms a part of this invention. The methoxy or alkanoyloxy derivatives of formula I R2 are prepared by alkylation acylation methods which are conventional to the art. For example, reaction of the 7,8 dihydroxy product obtained as above with diazomethane gives the dimethoxy derivative and with acetyl bromide in triethylamine gives the diacetoxy derivative. Selective demethylation of a 7,8 dimethoxy derivative with, for example, methionine in methanesulfonic acid gives the mixed hydroxy methoxy products. To prepare the 7,8 dihydroxy compounds of formula I wherein R3 is chlorine or bromine, the catechol product prepared above is oxidized with DDQ followed by reaction with hydrogen chloride or hydrogen bromide in methanolic solution. Alternatively a chloro or bromo substituted 3 benzazepine may be employed as a suitable starting material. Thus, for example, 3 methyl 7,8 dimethoxy 3benzazepine is brominated to give the 6,9 dibromo derivative which is reacted with n butyl lithium followed by the appropriately substituted disulfide to give the 6 thio substituted 9 bromo product. The dimethoxy groups can be cleaved with for example methionine in methanesulfonic acid. Further, a convenient method of preparation for a 6 chloro catechol product employs an N protected 7,8 dimethoxy 3 benzazepine as a starting material. For example,N carboethoxy 7,8 dimethoxy 3 benzazepine is reacted with a sulfenyl chloride under Friedel Crafts reaction conditions to introduce the 6 phenylthio group and the carboethoxy group is then reduced to methyl with an alkali metal hydride, for example lithium aluminum hydride. The 6 phenylthio group is oxidized with for example periodate to a phenylsulfinyl group and this compound is treated with thionyl chloride to simultaneously introduce the 9 chloro group and reduce the phenylsulfinyl to phenylthio. If desired, the dimethoxy groups can be cleaved with, for example, methionine in methanesulfonic acid. The 7,8 dihydroxy compounds of formula I whereinR3 is trifluoromethyl are prepared by reacting the corresponding 9 bromo substituted catechol with acetic anhydride to give the 7,8 diacetoxy derivative and treating this with trifluoromethyl iodide in the presence of copper powder in dimethylformamide to give the trifluoromethyl substituted compound, optionally followed by acid hydrolysis with dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid to obtain the unprotected derivatives. Similarly a 9 brom6 7,8 dimethoxy com pound of formula I can be converted to the corresponding 9 methyl product via conversion to the 9 carboxaldehyde, reduction to hydroxymethyl and hydrochloric acid treatment to give the chloromethyl derivative which is then reduced to methyl. The compounds of formula I wherein R2 and R3 are all hydrogen are conveniently prepared from a halo, such as bromo or chloro, substituted benzazepine by reaction with for example n butyl lithium followed by the appropriately substituted disulfide. Introduction of an R3 substituent other than hydrogen is accomplished for example by nitration of a chloro substituted benzazepine, displacement of the chlorine by the appropriately substituted mercaptan, followed by reduction of the nitro group, subsequent diazotization of the amine and conversion of the diazonium salt to the appropriate R3 substituted derivative. Similarly compounds of formula I wherein one R2 is hydroxy and R3 is hydrogen are obtained from the above described amino substituted benzazepine by diazotization followed by treatment with aqueous sulfuric acid. It will be obvious to one skilled in the art that other combinations of these basic reactions will give compounds of formula I wherein oneR2 is hydroxy and R3 is other than hydrogen, as illustrated in the examples below. The substituent R of the compounds of formula I can be conveniently introduced by reaction with a correspondingN unsubstituted derivative, for example as shown by the following formula EMI5.1 wherein R1 is phenyl and R2 is hydroxy or methoxy. Thus the N unsubstituted derivative is alkylated or acylated as appropriate to obtain the R substituted products of formulaI. The N unsubstituted derivatives are clearly valuable intermediates, forming a part of this invention, and can be prepared by methods described above for example via the dione or by bromination followed by introduction of the 6 thio substituent through a lithium intermediate. The dopamine receptor blocking activity of the compounds of this invention is demonstrated by antagonism of avoidance acquisition in rats and or block of the effects of dopamine on dopamine sensitive adenylate cyclase in rat striatal homogenate. Central dopamine receptor blocking activity is a measure of potential antipsychotic activity.In the pharmacological procedure used to measure antagonism of avoidance acquisition, naive male rats are given either a test compound or saline at a suitable time period prior to testing. The rats are then placed in a dark soundproof box with a grid floor through which footshock is delivered.Trials begin at 30 second intervals. The beginning of each trial is signaled by a light and a buzzer which continues for 10 seconds, at which time footshock is added for an additional 15 seconds. In each trial a single lever press by the animal terminates the sequence. Evaluation of drug activity is based on the number of trials in which the animals fail to avoid or fail to escape footshock during the last 40 trials of a 100 trial, 50 minute session. TheED50 is defined as that dose of drug calculated to reduce the number of avoidance responses during the last 40 trials to 50 of the pooled control value. As an example of the antipsychotic activity of the compounds of formula I, the ED50 values in mg kg, i.p.obtained from testing the indicated compounds in the above procedure are as follows 7,8 dihydroxy 3 methyl 6 phenylthio 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine, ED50 0.5 6 cyclohexylthio 7,8 dihydroxy 3 methyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine, ED50 1.0 9 chloro 7 ,8 dihydroxy 3 methyl 6 phenylthio 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine, ED50 0.08 7, 8 dihydroxy 3 methyl 6 p tr i fluoromethylphenyl thio 2,3,4, 5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine, ED50 1.6 3 methyl 6 phenylthio 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1R 3 benzazepine, EDsO 1.6 7 ,8 dihydroxy 3 methyl 6 2 thienylthio 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine, ED50 0.14 8 hydroxy 7 methoxy 3 methyl 6 phenylthio 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine, ED50 0.26 7 ,8 dihydroxy 6 p fluorophenylthio 3 methyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine, ED5n 0.18 7 ,8 dihydroxy 3 methyl 6 p tolylthio 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine, ED50 1.2 9 bromo 7 , 8 dihydroxy 3 methyl 6 phenylthio 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine, ED50 0.18 and 7 ,8 dihydroxy 6 furfurylthio 3 methyl 2,3,4 ,5 lH 3 benzazepine, ED50 1.2. For comparison, chlorpromazine has an Avoidance ED50 of 1.5 mg kg, i.p. The compounds of formula I wherein both R2 are hydroxy catechols have antiemetic activity as demonstrated by anti apomorphine activity in dogs. In this pharmacological procedure, a test compound is administered subcutaneously to one or more groups of test animals pre selected for their sensitivity to apomorphine while another group serves as controls. After a suitable pretreatment time, apomorphine hydrochloride is administered to each animal in a dosage of 0.1 mg kg, s.c. Frequency of emesis is observed and recorded over the next 40 minutes. The mean frequency of emesis is calculated for each test group and compared with the controls. Final results are reported as a percentage change in emetic frequency of the test animals relative to the controls.A test compound is considered active if it produces at least a 20 change in emetic frequency of the test animals from that of the controls. The catechols have antiemeticED50 values that is, reduce emetic frequency by 50 over controls of less than 1 mg kg, s.c. The compounds of this invention may be administered as pharmaceutical compositions in conventional dosage unit forms. These compositions which form a part of this invention are prepared by incorporating a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, in a nontoxic amount sufficient to produce dopamine receptor blocking activity in an animal or human subject, with a nontoxic pharmaceutical carrier according to accepted procedures. Preferably the compositions will contain the active ingredient in an active but nontoxic amount selected from about 1 mg. to about 300 mg.of active ingredient per dosage unit. The pharmaceutical carrier employed may be, for example, either a solid or liquid, giving rise to a wide variety of pharmaceutical forms. If a solid pharmaceutical carrier is used, such as lactose, magnesium stearate, terra alba, sucrose, talc, stearic acid, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia and the like, the composition can be tableted, used as a pharmaceutical powder, placed in a hard gelatin capsule or in the form of a troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier will vary widely but preferably will be from about 25 mg. to about 1 g. If a liquid pharmaceutical carrier is used, such as syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, sesame oil, water and the like, the composition will be in the form of a soft gelatin capsule, syrup, emulsion or a liquid suspension.Similarly the carrier or diluent may include a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax. Parenteral dosage forms such as for intramuscular administration are obtained by dissolving a water soluble salt of the active medicament in water or saline solution in a concentration such that 1 ml. of the solution contains from about 2 mg. to about 50 mg. of active ingredient. The solution can then be filled into single ampuls or multiple dose vials. The pharmaceutical preparations are made following the conventional techniques of the pharmaceutical chemist involving mixing, granulating and compressing when necessary, or variously mixing and dissolving the ingredients as appropriate to give the desired end product. To produce dopamine receptor blocking activity, a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, usually combined with a pharmaceutical carrier, is administered internally to an animal or human subject in need of such activity in a nontoxic amount sufficient to produce said activity. The route of administration may be oral or parenteral. Advantageously equal doses will be administered until a desired effect is obtained, for example two or three times a day, with the daily dosage regimen being selected from about 2 mg. to about 900 mg. of active ingredient. The following examples illustrate the preparation of specific compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention and as such are not to be construed as limitations thereof. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other modifications of the synthetic procedures described and the use of alternative starting materials may also be employed to prepare the compounds of formula I.
