## Description
DESCRIPTION INTEGRAL PLASTIC FASTENER BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to integral plastic fastene, r s especially for plastic covers to be attached to sZÅat belt retractors. Discription of the Prior Art Devices such as covers for rewind springs and for tension relieving mechanisms have been attached to seat belt retractors by a variety of means. Such means include the use of integral plastic fasteners. For example, plastic push pin type fasteners have been molded into retractor spring covers. In addition, split pin type fasteners have been suggested, as disclosed inU.S.P. 4,204,652 to Cislak et al., for example.Furthermore, integral plastic fasteners for retractor spring covers have been utilized which include outwardly tapered legs. The prior fasteners, although generally acceptable, are either difficult and hence relatively expensive to mold or have extraction strengths which are only moderately high. It would be desirable to provide an integral fastener which was easy to mold and yet offered high extraction strengths. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance this invention, there is provided, in a molded plastic article adapted to be attached by an integrally molded plastic fastener to a cooperating part having an aperture for receiving the fastener, the improvement comprising the plastic article having a first surface, an opposite second surface and a solid central portion between the surfaces the fastener comprising an integral lug extending from the first surface outwardly and termin atinb in a distal end, the portion of the first surface which intersects the lug defining a shoulder adapted to surround the aperture, the central portion of the lug having an axial hollow core, the core being surrounded by a solid wall portion, the hollow core extending from a first end adjacent the distal end to a second end which is located interiorly of the first surface so as at least to extend into the solid central portion of the plastic article, the length of the core being greater than the length of the lug and the outside lateral dimension of the lug being substantially the same adjacent the first surface and adjacent the distal end. Preferably, the cooperating part is a seat belt retractor and the molded plastic article is a cover for a part of the retractor. Also, preferably the inner walls of the core taper slightly inwardly from the distal end to the second end, and the second end terminates within the central portion of the plastic article. In addition, it is preferred that the core has a generally circular shape as does the outer wall of the lug. It has also been found that in situations in which there is high interference fit, the fastener preferably has a ssubstantially square or triangular core in order to insure that the fasteners fully seat against the apertured walls of the retaining device. Furthermore, such fasteners are not damaged by high interference fit and thus can accommodate greater production variances. Extraction forces are comparable with the cylindrical c Ïre fasteners. The integral fastener of this invention is easy to mold and exhibits very good extraction strength, even after exposure to heat and humidity. In addition, the insertion force is reduced over prior art fasteners and the extraction strength is retained over a wide range of interference fits. Thus, the fastener does not require high tolerances. The lug is retained within the aperture solely by an interference fit due to compres sion of the plastic material.

DESCRIPTIO Ti PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS With reference to the drawings, there is shown in Fig. 1 a plastic fastener generally indicated at 10 integrally attached to a molded plastic article 12. A variety of plastic materials may be employed that possess the requisite flexibility, strength, ease of molding and cost benefits the presently preferred material is nylon. Fastener 10 includes an integral lug 14 that commences at a first end 16 that intersects a first surface 18 of plastic article 12 substantially at right angles and extends outwardly therefrom, term inating in a distal end 20. Outer wall 22 extending between the ends of lug 14 preferably has a circular cross section and a smooth surface for ease of insertionThe intersection of outer wall 22 and distal end 20 preferably approximates a right angle, but may be slightly rounded for ease in molding. A hollow core 24 is provided approximately at the center of lug 14 and extends from the distal end 20 of lug 14 towards plastic article 12. Core 24 terminates beyond first surface 18 and preferably in e interior of plastic article 12 at end 26. Alternatively, core 24 may extend completely through plastic article 12, but preferably end 26 is closed to avoid problems with dust, etc. The shape of inner wall 28 which defines core 24 is circular at least adjacent end 20. Wall 28 preferably is slightly tapered inwardly from end 20 towards end 26, e.g., a few degrees.However, the diameter of outer wall 22 at end 20 D1 is substantially the same as the diameter at end 16 D2 since outer wall 22 is not tapered. It can be seen that the length of lug 14 L1 is less than the length of core 24 L2 . As pointed out above, lug 24 is flexible and is formed of a compressible material. In Fig. 2A, there is shown a fastener in which core 24 is substantially square adjacent end 20.Although edges 25 of inner wall 28 may be formed at right angles, they are preferably slightly curved for ease in molding. In the embodiment of Fig. 2B, the shape of inner wall 28 is substantially triangular. As shown, the intersecting sides of the triangle are preferably slightly rounded at 27 to provide a generally trilobal cross section for ease in molding. Fig. 3 illustrates one preferred embodiment of this invention wherein the plastic article is a cover for a part of a seat belt retractor. Retractor 30 includes a frame 32 to which a spool 33 of seat belt webbing is attached. As is conventional in such retractors, a rewind spring not shown is employed to bias the seat belt webbing towards the retractor. The rewind spring is typically located on the exterior of frame 32 and is contained within a spring cover 34.Cover 34 has a generally circular shaped flat bottom wall 36 and a side wall 38 which extends outwardly from bottom wall 36 and terminates in a circular mounting flange 40 which extends radially from side wall 38.Flange 40 is provided with a plurality of integral fasteners 10 in the form as shown in Fig. 1. Retractor frame 32 is provided with corresponding round apertures aperture 42 in Fig. 4 for engagement by lugs 14. The diameter of the apertures is chosen to be somewhat less than the diameter D1 of lug 14 so that the lugs are held by an interference fit within the apertures and are held under compression. As shown in Fig. 4, it can be seen that end 28 of lug 14 extends into aperture 42 and terminates beyond inner wall 44 of frame 32 however, end 28 may alternatively be flush or inset with wall 44. The lower wall 46 of flange 42 adjacent end 16 of lug 14 which corresponds to surface 18 in Fig. 1 forms a shoulder around lug 14 and is abutted against outer wall 48 of frame 32. An example of the dimensions of lug 14 are as follows L1 3.8 mm, L2 4.3 mm, D1 4.3 mm,D2 4.3 mm, diameter of core 24 2.8 mm, and the thickness of flange 40 1.2 mm. The degree of taper is 30 A typical diameter of aperture 42 is 4.04 mm in a wall having a thickness of 3 mm. A typical width of a square core is 2.7 mm and a typical height of a triangular core is 3 mm. Although in the above description the plastic article has been referred to as a cover for a retractor rewind spring, the cover may also be a cover for a tension relieving device, for a gear structure or other plastic article. The fastener of this invention exhibits many advantages over the prior art. The fastener of this invention exhibits a higher extraction force than prior art fasteners, such as on the order of about 50 higher. At the same time, the insertion force is lower, such as on the order of about 40 lower. Thus, articles incorporating the fasteners are easier to assemble. The high extraction force is retained over a considerable range of interference fit, such as about 0.004 to 0.024 inches 0.1 to 0.6 mm . As a result, the dimensions of the fastener, particularly the outside diameter and wall thickness, do not require close tolerances, thereby reducing manufacturing costs. In addition, the extra ction force is not adversely affected by heat and humidity as is the prior art fastener in fact, the extraction force of the present fastener is increased under such conditions.Furthermore, the extraction force of the fastener is not substantially adversely effected by repeated insertions and extractions. For example, on the order of 90 of the extraction force is retained after two insertion extraction cycles. Thus, the parts incorporating the present fastener can be reworked, increasing the salvage rate and further reducing manufacturing costs. The integral fasteners of square or triangular cross section have been found to fully seat at high interference fits. For example, at an interference fit of 0.029 in. 0.74 mm , both the square and triangular cored fasteners fully seat with the apertured surface, whereas the circular cored fastener had a clearance of about 0.010 in. 0.25 mm . Additionally, since the fasteners of this invention are not damaged by high interference fit, they can accommodate greater production variances. Moreover, it has been found that the square cored fasteners exhibit higher extraction strengths than the circular cored fastener.
