# Magnetic tape cassette.

## Abstract
In a magnetic tape cassette with a front aperture or re cess at least one front cover is provided which can pivot under spring force from an open position to a closed position about a pivot which is perpendicular to the side walls of the housing of the cassette, which cover is latched in the closed position by means of at least one latching lever disposed near a side wall. The latching lever, which comprises two arms arranged in the form of an L can pivot into a latching position about a pivot which is arranged on said side wall parallel to the pivot of the front cover. The longer arm of the lever is elastically deflexible over at least a part of its length and at one end comprises a latching portion, which during the pivotal movement of the lever is guided by guide means disposed near the latching portion. The shorter arm is connected at one end to the pivot of the latching lever.
