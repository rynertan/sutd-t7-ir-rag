# Communication adapter circuit.

## Abstract
A communication adapter circuit 10 is connected to a processor through a data bus 12 and a control bus 14 . Data and control signals are provided through the buses 12, 14 to a timer circuit 18 , a programmable peripheral interface circuit 20 , an asynchronous and bisynchronous control circuit 22 and an SDLC HDLC control circuit 24 . Each of the control circuits 22, 24 includes parallel to serial and serial to parallel conversion circuitry. A clock select circuit 32 operates in conjunction with the timer circuit 18 and the programmable peripheral interface circuit 20 to establish a data transmission rate for the data flow through the adapter circuit 10 . From the control circuits 22, 24 the data is transmitted through a bi directional serial line 44 to a dual modem switch 56 . From the switch 56 the data is transmitted to either an interface circuit 60 to a convention al modem or through a line 64 to an internal modem.
