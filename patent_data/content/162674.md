# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR CONTROL OF FRUIT RIPENING, DEGREENING AND STORAGE

## Abstract
Apparatus and process for removing carbon dioxide from and or dosing ethylene into an enclosed space used for fruit and vegetable ripening, degreening or storage com prising a carbon dioxide absorption system including an aqueous solution of carbon dioxide absorbent wherein the atmosphere from the enclosed space is substantially cleansed of carbon dioxide and simultaneously the atmos phere picks up water to substantially saturation concentra tion to humidify the atmosphere, and digital release apparatus for receiving small containers of pressurised eth ylene whereby discrete amounts of ethylene gas are released from said containers to substantially prevent risk of fire or explosion in the enclosed space.
