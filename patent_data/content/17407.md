# FUEL BURNER AND FUEL DISTRIBUTION DEVICE THEREFOR

## Abstract
A fuel burner capable of burning oil, gas or pulverised coal fuel is provided. The burner is particularly suitable for large scale installations such as for steam boilers for power generation plants. The burner provides a single main airstream which may be supplemented by a secondary gas flow. The secondary flow may be of burnt gases so that flame temperature may be controlled to prevent production of pollutant nitrogen oxides. A novel burner fuel distribution nozzle is also provided.
