## Description
Herbicidal sulfonamides, and the preparation and use thereof. This invention relates to herbicidal sulfonamides, and the preparation and use thereof in agriculture. French Patent No. 1,468,7t7 discloses the following cara substltuted phenylsulfonamides, useful as antidiabetic agents EMI1.1 where R H, halogen, CF3 or alkyl. Logemann et al., Chem. Ab., 53, 18052 g 1959 , disclose a number of sulfonamides, including uracil derivatives and those having the formula EMI1.2 wherein R is butyl, phenyl orEMI1.3 and R1 is hydrogen or methyl. When tested for hypoglycemic effect in rats oral doses of 25 mg 100 g , the compounds in which R is butyl or phenyl were most potent.The others were of low potency or inactive. Wojciechowski, J. Acta. Polon. Pharm. 19, p. 121 5 1962 Chem. Ab., 59 1633 e describes the synthesis of N 2,6 dimethoxypyrimidin 4 yl aminocar bonyl 4 methy lbenzenesulf onami de EMI2.1 Based upon similarity to a known compound, the author predicted hypoglycemic activity for the foregoing compound. Netherlands Patent 121,788, publishedSeptember 15, 1966, teaches the preparation of compounds of Formula i , and their use as general or selective herbicides whereinEMI2.2 R1 and R2 may independently be alkyl of 1 4 carbon atoms and R3 and R4 may independently be hydrogen, chlorine or alkyl of 1 4 carbon atoms. Compounds of Formula ii , and their use as antidiabetic agents, are reported in J. Dug Res. 6, 123 1974 EMI2.3 wherein R is pyridyl. The presence of undesired vegetation causes substantial damage to useful crops, especially agricultural products that satisfy man s basic food needs, such as soybeans, wheat, and the like. The current population explosion and concomitant world food shortage demand improvements in the efficiency of producing these crops. Prevention or minimizing the loss of a portion of such valuable crops by killing, or inhibiting the growth of undesired vegetation is one way of improving this efficiency. A wide variety of materials useful for killing,or inhibiting controlling the growth of undesired vegetation is available such materials are commonly referred to as herbicides. The need exists, however, for still more effective herbicides that destroy or retard weeds without causing significant damage to useful crops. According to this invention, there is provided compounds of Formula I and their agriculturally suitable salts, suitable agricultural compositions containing them, and methods of using them as selective, as well as general herbicides having both preemergence and postemergence activity. These compounds are highly active herbicides. They are especially useful for controlling weeds in wheat.EMI3.1 whereEMI3.2 R2 and R3 are independently hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, methyl, methoxy, nitro or trifluoromethyl W is oxygen or sulfur X is NECE3 or N CH3 2 Z is methyl or methoxy and A is C or N H and their agriculturally suitable salts, provided that when R2 is nitro or trifluoromethyl, R3 cannot be nitro or trifluoromethyl. Preferred for their high herbicidal activity or favorable cost or both are those compounds ofFormula I where independently EMI4.1 R2 is fluorine, chlorine, bromine, methyl or nitro and 23 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, methyl or nitro. More preferred for their higher herbicidal activity or more favorable cost or both are those compounds of Formula I where EMI4.2 R2 is chlorine, methyl or nitro and R3 is hydrogen, chlorine or methyl. Most preferred for their excellent herbicidal activity or more favorable cost or both are those compounds of Formula I where EMI4.3 R2 is chlorine, methyl or nitro R3 is hydrogen, chlorine or methyl and W is oxygen. Specifically preferred for their outstanding herbicidal activity or highly favorable cost or both are 1. 2 chloro N 4 methoxy 6 methylamino 1,3,5 tria zin 2 yl aminocarbonyl benzenesulfonamide, m.p. 224 2280C 2. 2 chloro N 4 dimethylamino 6 methoxy 1,3,5 triazin 2 yl aminocarbonyl benzenesulfonamide, m.p. 200 2060C 3.

In addition to having excellent activity for broad spectrum control of vegetation, the compounds ofFormula I are also useful for selective control of volunteer corn in soybeans, weeds in wheat, brush control and water hyacinth control. Moreover, the compounds of Formula I,are useful plait growth regulants, e.g.increasing sugar content in sugar cane and sorghum and supressing seed head formation in grasses such asBahia grass. As shown in Equation I, the compounds ofFormula I can be prepared by combining an appropriate 2 aminoheterocycle of Formula III with an appropriately substituted sulfonyl isocyanate or isothiocyanate of Formula II R1, W, X and Z being as previously defined. Eauation IEMI5.1 The reaction is best carried out in inert aprotic organic solvents such as methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile, at ambient pressure and temperature. The mode of addition is not critical however, it is often convenient to add the sulfonyl isocyanate or isothiocyanate to a stirred suspensionof the aminoheterocycle. Since isocyanates and isothiocyanates usually are liquids, their addition is more easily controlled. The reaction is generally exothermic. In some cases, the desired product is insoluble in the warm reaction medium and crystallizes from it in pure form. Products soluble in the reaction medium are isolated by evaporation of the solvent, trituration of the solid residue with solvents such as l chlorobutane, ethyl ether, or pentane, and filtration. The intermediate sulfonyl isocyanates ofFormula II wherein W is 0 can be prepared by reacting corresponding sulfonamides with phosgene in the presence of n butyl isocyanate at reflux in a solvent such as chlorobenzene, according to the procedure ofH. Ulrich and A. A. Y. Sayigh, Newer Methods of Prear ative Organic Chemistry, Vol. VI, p. 223 241, AcademicPress, New York and London, W. Foerst, Ed. In cases where formation of the desired sulfonyl isocyanate is difficult by the above procedure, the sulfonyl urea formed by the reaction of butyl isocyanate with the appropriate sulfonamide is treated with phosgene according to the above reference. The preparation of sulfonamides from ammonium hydroxide and sulfonyl chlorides is widely reported in the literature, e.g. Crossley et al., J. Am.Chem. Soc., 60, 2223 1938 . Certain sulfonyl chlorides are best prepared by chlorosulfonation of a substituted benzene or thiophene according to the teaching of H. T. Clarke et al. Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 1, 2nd Ed. 1941, p. 85.Other benzenesulfonyl chlorides are best made by diazotization of the appropriate aniline with sodium nitrite in HCl, followed by reaction of the diazonium salt with sulfur dioxide and cuprous chloride in acetic acid according to the teaching of H. L. Yale and F. Sowinski, J. Org. Chem. 25 1824 1960 . Sulfonyl isothiocyanates can be prepared by treatment of sulfonamides with carbon disulfide and potassium hydroxide followed by reaction of the dipotassium salt with phosgene according to the teaching of R. Hartke, Arch. Pharm., 299, 174 1966 . The synthesis of heterocyclic amine derivatives has been reviewed in The Chemistry of Hetero cyclic Compounds , a series published by IntersciencePubl., New York and London. 2 Aminopyrinidines are described by D. J. Brown in The Pyrimidines , Vol. XVI of the above series. 2 Amino 1,3,5 triazines can be synthesized according to the methods described by E. M. Smolin andL. Rapport in s Triazines and Derivatives , Vol. XfII, of the same series. Agriculturally suitable salts of compounds of Formula I are also useful herbicides and can be prepared in a number of ways known to the art. For example, metal salts can be made by treating compounds of Formula I with a solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt having a sufficiently basic anion e.g. hydroxide, alkoxide, carbonate or hydride .Quarternary amine salts can be made by similar techniques. Salts of compounds of Formula I can also be prepared by exchange of one cation for another. Cationic exchange can be effected by direct treatment of an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g. alkali or quaternary amine salt with a solution containing the cation to be exchanged. This method is most effective when the desired salt containing the exchanged cation is insoluble in water and can be separated by filtration. Exchange may also be effected by passing an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g. an alkali metal or quaternary amine salt through a column packed with a cation exchange resin containing the cation to be exchanged. In this method, the cation of the resin is exchanged for that of the original salt and the desired product is eluted from the column. This method is particularly useful when the desired salt is water soluble. Acid addition salts, useful in this invention, can be obtained by reacting a compound of Formula I with a suitable acid, e,g. a toluenesulfonic acid, trichloroacetic acid or the like. The compounds of this invention and their preparation are further illustrated by the following examples wherein temperatures are given in degrees centigrade and parts are by weight unless otherwise designated.

They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like.Many of these may be applied directly. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at.spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare.High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulations. The formulations, broadly, contain about 0.1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid diluent s . More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Table III Active Ingredient Diluent s Surf actant s Wettable Powders 20 90 0 74 1 10Oil Suspensions, E3ul 3 50 40 95 0 15 sions, Solutions in eluding Emulsifiable Concentrates Aqueous Suspensions 10 50 40 84 1 20Dusts 1 25 70 99 0 5Granules Pellets 0.1 95 5 99.9 0 15High Strength Ccmpo 90 99 0 10 0 2 sitions Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound.Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described inWatkins et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, New Jersey. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guids , 2nd Ed., Interscience, New York 1950 .Solubility under 0.1 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at 0oC. tMcCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual , MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, NewJersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia ofSurface Active Agents , Chemical Publishing Co., Inc.,New York 1964 , list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foam, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E.

They may be applied either pre or postemergence for the control of undesired vegetation in noncrop areas or for selective weed control in certain crops, e.g. wheat and soybeans. By properly selecting rate and time of application, compounds of this invention may be used to modify plant growth beneficially The precise amount of the compound of Formula I to be used in any given situation will vary according to the particular end result desired, the use involved, the weeds to be controlled, the soil type, the formulation and mode of application, weather conditions, etc. Since so many variables play a role, it is not possible to state a rate of application suitable for all situations. Broadly speaking, the compounds of this invention are used at levels of about 0.1 to 20 kg ha with a preferred range of 0.1 to 10 kg ha.The lower rates of the range will generally be selected for lighter soils, for selective weed control in crops, or in situations where maximum persistence is not necessary. Some of the compounds of Formula I can be used at very low rates for plant growth modification, but higher rates may also be useful, depending on factors such as the crop being treated, timing of treatment, etc. The compounds of Formula I may be combined with other herbicides and are particularly useful in combination with 3 3,4 dichlorophenyl 1,1 dimethylurea, the triazines such as 2 chloro 4 ethylamino 6 isopropylamino s triazine, the uracils such as 5bromo 3 sec butyl 6 methyluracil, N phosphonomethyl glycine, 3 cyclohexyl 1 methyl 6 dimethylamino striazine 2,4 1H,3H dione, N,N dimethyl 2,2 diphenyl acet2mide, 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and closely related compounds , 4 chloro 2 butynyl 3 chlorophenyl carhamate, diisopropylthiolcarbamic acid, ester with 2,3 dichloroallyl alcohol, diisopropylthiolcarbamic acid, S 2,3, 3 trichloroallyl ester, ethyl N benzoylN 3,4 dichlorophenyl 2 aminopropionate, 1,2 dimethyl3, 5 diphenylpyrazolium methylsulfate, methyl 2 4 2,4 dichlorophenoxy phenoxy propanoate, 4 amino 6 tert butyl 3 methylthio 1,2,4 triazin 5 4E one, 3 3,4dichlorophenyl l methoxy l methylurea, 3 isopropyl lE 2,1,3 benzothiodiazin 4 3E one 2,2 dioxide, atata trifluoro 2,6 dinitro N,N dipropyl p toluidine, l,l dimethyl 4,4 bipyridinium ion, monosodium methanearsonate, 2 chloro 2 ,6 diethyl methoxymethyl acetanilide, and l,l dimethyl 3 a,a,a trifluoro mtolyl urea. The activity of these compounds was discovered in greenhouse tests. The tests are described and the data resulting from them are shown below.Test Procedure Seeds of crabgrass Digitaria sp. , barnyardgrass Echinochloa crusgalli , wild oats Avena fatua ,Cassia tora, morningglory IBomoea sp. , cocklebur Xanthium sp. , sorghum, corn, soybean, rice, wheat and nutsedge tubers were planted in a growth medium and treated preemergence with the chemicals dissolved in a nonphytotoxic solvent.At the same time, cotton having five leaves including cotyledonary ones , bush beans with the third trifoliolate leaf expanding, crabgrass with two leaves, barnyardgrass with two leaves, wild oats with one leaf, cassia with three leaves including cotyledonary ones , morningglory with four leaves including the cotyledonary ones , cocklebur with four leaves including the cotyledonary ones , sorghum with three leaves, corn with three leaves soybean with two cotyledonary leaves, rice with two leaves, wheat with one leaf, and nutsedge with three five leaves were sprayed. Treated plants and controls were maintained in a greenhouse for 16 days, then all species were compared to controls and visually rated for response to treatment, using 1 3 ratings in each test. Ratings for compounds tested by this procedure are recorded in Table III. 0 no effect 10 maximum effect C chlorosis or necrosis E emergence inhibition G growth retardation H formative effects S albinism U unusual pigmentation 6Y abscised buds or flowers.

Approximately 2 1 2 weeks after planting, the young plants and the soil around them were sprayed overall with the test chemicals dissolved in a nonphytotoxic solvent. Fourteen days after treatment, all species were compared to untreated controls and visually rated for response to treatment.The data are presented in Table V.
