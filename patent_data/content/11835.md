# A logic array having improved speed characteristics.

## Abstract
An integrated circuit Read Only Memory ROM with improved speed of operation is disclosed as generally rep resentative of similarly improved logic arrays. The ROM includes parallel rows of conductors oriented normal to para llel doped regions which form column conductors. The ROM is implemented with field effect transistors and comprises two decoder fields and a data field. The transistors of the decoder fields serve to define open circuits between adjacent column conductors in accordance with binary input signals applied to the decoder fields. In the illustrative ROM, a first column conductor 646 is connected to a return terminal of a power supply and a second column conductor 638 is con nected to a pull up circuit 614. The illustrative circuit pro vides for the connection of power supply return connections to both ends of the one column conductor and provides for the connection of pull up circuits to both ends of the second column conductor. The row conductors are connected to gates of transistors in both the data and the decoder fields and a low impedance path from the pull up circuits to the power supply return is established in response to signals on the row conductors.
