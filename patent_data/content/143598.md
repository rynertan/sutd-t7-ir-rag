# MAGNETIC TAPE RECORDING AND REPRODUCING SYSTEM WITH AUTOMATIC TAPE THREADING

## Abstract
The present invention provides a small, high performance magnetic tape transport system for use in recording and re producing data. In preferred embodiments, the supply reel for the magnetic tape medium and the tape is carried in a pack or cartridge which is capable of being easily loaded into the transport system for recording writing and reproducing reading , and which cartridge is also easily removed from the system for storage. A take up reel or hub is permanently carried by the transport. In the embodiment disclosed, means are included for loading, automatically positioning and seating a cartridge in contact with a drive mechanism in the transport, and for ejecting a cartridge therefrom. The separate cartridge drive and take up hub are each driven by their own separate motor system in either a counter clockwise or clockwise direction, as required, with the direction and speed of each motor being interrelated, as set forth in greater detail herein.
