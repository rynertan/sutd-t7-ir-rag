# Multilayer ceramic capacitor.

## Abstract
A multilayer ceramic capacitor characterized by a stack of alternate dielectric layers of oxidic ceramic material and electrode layers consisting of a mixture of a metal having a high electric conductivity and ceramic particles of a material having a sintering temperature which is above the sintering temperature of the oxidic ceramic material of the dielectric layers. As a result of this electrode composition the capacitor can be manufactured by means of a uniaxial pressure sintering process in which the stack is sintered while simultaneously applying pressure in the direction transverse to the plane of the layers. This leads to dielectric layers which are substantially free from pores and have a thickness of at most 20 Âµm.
