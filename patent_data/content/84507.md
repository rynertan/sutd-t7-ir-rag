# Internal combustion engine ignition system.

## Abstract
The invention provides a circuit 100 that isolates the electrical signals or noise in an ignition system from a computer 60 which controls the timing of the ignition system. The circuit is characterized by an electro optical coupling device 130 such as a photosensitive transistor 125 controlled by a light emitting diode 120 to provide a variable light output in response to a variable output signal from the computer analyzing the operation of the engine.
