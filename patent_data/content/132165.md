# Adsorbable alkynyl substituted heterocyclic quaternary ammonium salts and applications thereof to silver halide photography.

## Abstract
The use of thioamido and alkynyl substituted heterocyclic ammonium salts in producing images in silver halide photo graphic elements is disclosed. The thiomideo and alkynyl substituted heterocyclic ammonium salts can be incorporated in photographic silver halide emulsions. The thiomido sub stituent is capable of promoting adsorption of these salts to silver halide grain surfaces. In negative working surface latent image forming emulsions the thiomido and alkynyl substi tuted heterocyclic ammonium salts permit higher speeds to be achieved. In direct positive internal latent image forming emulsions nucleation activity and improved incubation stabil ity can be achieved.
