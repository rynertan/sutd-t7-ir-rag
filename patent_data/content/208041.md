## Description
This specification describes an invention relating to a novel dispersible composition of finely divided non magnetic solid and a dispersant and to a dispersion of the composition in an organic medium. According to the present invention there is provided a composition comprising a finely divided non magnetic solid and a dispersant comprising a poly C₂ ₄ alkyleneimine carrying at least two mono or poly carbonyl C₁ ₇ alkyleneoxy groups. The composition may comprise an intimate mixture of the two components but preferably comprises a coating of the surfactant on finely divided primary particles of the solid which preferably have a mean diameter below 10 microns and more preferably below 5 microns. The composition may be dry, in which case the primary particles of the solid may be aggregated, or it may be in the form of a dispersion of the solid in an organic medium, preferably one which is a liquid, or is at least plastic, under ambient or processing conditions. The composition preferably contains from 1 to 100 , and more preferably from 1 to 30 , by weight of the dispersant, based on the weight of the solid. In the dispersion form, the composition preferably contains from 5 to 95 by weight of the solid, the precise quantity depending on the nature of the solid and the relative densities of the solid and liquid. For example, a dispersion in which the solid is an organic material, such as an organic pigment, preferably contains from 15 to 60 by weight of the solid, whereas a dispersion in which the solid is an inorganic material, such as an inorganic pigment, filler or extender, preferably contains from 40 to 90 of the solid, based on the total weight of the composition. The composition may be prepared by mixing the components or the dispersant may be added to the solid during the preparation of the latter, preferably during the later or finishing stages of preparation. The composition may also be prepared by subjecting a mixture of the solid, the surfactant, preferably in the organic medium, to a grinding operation sufficient to reduce the particle size of the solid to below 10 microns. Where the organic medium is a volatile liquid this may be subsequently removed by evaporation, if the composition is required in a dry form. Where the organic medium is a solid or plastic material at ambient temperatures, e.g. a polar resin, the mixing of the components and subsequent grinding operation may be carried out at an elevated temperature so that the organic medium and the composition is in a fluid or plastic, form. The composition, whether dry or in the form of a dispersion, may contain other ingredients, such as resins where these do not already constitute the organic medium , binders, fluidising agents, anti sedimentation agents, plasticisers, levelling agents and preservatives. The present composition is compatible with the fluidising agents disclosed in GB A 1508576 and 2108143. The fluidising agent described in GB A 1508576 is a substituted ammonium salt of a coloured acid wherein there are from 19 to 60 carbon atoms in at least 3 chains attached to the N atom of the substituted ammonium ion. The fluidising agent described in GB A 2108143 is a water insoluble disazo compound comprising a central divalent group free from acidic and other ionic substituents linked, through azo groups, to two monovalent end groups, one end group being free from acidic and other ionic substituents and the other carrying a single substituted ammonium salt group. Such fluidising agents are useful for enhancing the fluidity of the dispersion form of the present compositions and especially where the organic medium is an ester, a ketone or an aromatic solvent, such as xylene or chlorobenzene. The composition is particularly suitable for use in paints, especially high solids paints, inks, especially flexographic, gravure and screen inks, and non aqueous ceramic processes, especially tape coating, doctor blade, extrusion and injection moulding type processes. Paint systems in which the composition is particularly suitable include those based on alkyd resins, particularly medium and short oil alkyd resins, oil free polyester resins, polyol resins, urethane resins and acrylic resins. Particularly suitable hardeners or crosslinkers include melamine formaldehyde resins, particularly butylated melamine formaldehyde and hexamethoxymethyl melamine resins, urea formaldehyde resins, urethanes and isocyanates. Gravure inks in which the composition is particularly suitable include gravure inks of types C, D and E as classified by the Gravure Technical Association of New York. The solid may be any non magnetic material, especially a material which it is desired to stabilise in a finely divided state in an organic medium. Examples of suitable solids are pigments for solvent inks pigments, extenders and fillers for paints and plastics materials dyes, especially disperse dyes optical brightening agents and textile auxiliaries for solvent dyebaths, inks and other solvent application systems solids for oil based and invert emulsion drilling muds dirt and soil particles in dry cleaning fluids particulate ceramic materials and biocides, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals which are applied as dispersions in organic media. A preferred solid is a pigment from any of the recognised classes of pigments described, for example, in the Third Edition of the Colours Index 1971 and subsequent revisions of, and supplements thereto, under the chapter headed Pigments . Examples of inorganic pigments are titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, Prussian blue, cadmium sulphide, iron oxides, vermillion, ultramarine and the chrome pigments, including chromates, molybdates and mixed chromates and sulphates of lead, zinc, barium, calcium, and mixtures and modifications thereof which are commercially available as greenish yellow to red pigments under the names primrose, lemon, middle, orange, scarlet and red chromes. Examples of organic pigments are those from the azo, disazo, condensed azo, thioindigo, indanthrone, isoindanthrone, anthanthrone, anthraquinone, isodibenzanthrone, triphendioxazine, quinacridone and phthalocyanine series, especially copper phthalocyanine and its nuclear halogenated derivatives, and also lakes of acid, basic and mordant dyes. Carbon black, although strictly inorganic, behaves more like an organic pigment in its dispersing properties. Preferred organic pigments are phthalocyanines, especially copper phthalocyanines, monoazos, disazos, indanthrones, anthranthrones, quinacridones and carbon blacks. Examples of extenders and fillers are talc, kaolin, silica, barytes and chalk. Examples of suitable particulate ceramic materials are alumina, silica, zirconia, titania, silicon nitride, boron nitride, silicon carbide, boron carbide, mixed silicon aluminium nitrides and metal titanates Examples of agrochemicals include the fungicides flutriafen, carbendazim, chlorothalonil and mancozeb. Where the composition of the present invention is in the form of a dispersion, the organic medium is preferably a polar organic medium or a substantially non polar aromatic hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon. By the term polar in relation to the organic medium is meant an organic liquid or resin capable of forming moderate to strong bonds as described in the article entitled A Three Dimensional Approach to Solubility by Crowley et al in Journal of Paint Technology, Vol.38, 1966, at page 269. Such organic media generally have a hydrogen bonding number of 5 or more as defined in the above mentioned article. Examples of suitable polar organic liquids are amines, ethers, especially lower alkyl ethers, organic acids, esters, ketones, glycols, alcohols and amides. Numerous specific examples of such moderately and strongly hydrogen bonding liquids are given in the book entitled Compatibility and Solubility by Ibert Mellan published in 1968 by Noyes Development Corporation in Table 2.14 on pages 39 and 40 and these liquids all fall within the scope of the term polar organic liquid as used in this specification. Preferred polar organic liquids are dialkyl ketones, alkyl esters of alkane carboxylic acids and alkanols, especially such liquids containing up to, and including, a total of 6 carbon atoms. As examples of the preferred and especially preferred liquids there may be mentioned dialkyl and cycloalkyl ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, di ethylketone, di iso propylketone, methyl iso butyl ketone, di iso butylketone, methyl iso amyl ketone, methyl n amyl ketone and cyclohexanone alkyl esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl formate, methyl propionate and ethyl butyrate, glycols and glycol esters and ethers, such as ethylene glycol, 2 ethoxyethanol, 3 methoxypropylpropanol, 3 ethoxypropylpropanol, 2 butoxyethyl acetate, 3 methoxypropyl acetate, 3 ethoxypropyl acetate and 2 ethoxyethyl acetate, alkanols such as methanol, ethanol, The substantially non polar, organic liquids which may be used, either alone or in admixture with the aforementioned polar solvents, are aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene and xylene, and halogenated aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene and chlorobenzene. However, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as petroleum fractions and white spirit are preferably only employed in admixture with the above mentioned polar solvents and the proportion of an aliphatic hydrocarbon should preferably not exceed a level which reduces the ability of the mixture to completely dissolve the resins which may form a part of the dispersion because the are required in end use formulations, such as inks, paints and ceramic moulding compositions. Examples of suitable polar resins, as the medium for the dispersion form of the present invention, are film forming resins such as are suitable for the preparation of inks, paints and chips for use in various applications such as paints and inks. Specific examples of such polar resins are polyesters, such as polyethylene terephthalate, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate and propionate and polacrylates, polyamides, such as Versamid Trade Mark and Wolfamid Trade Mark , and celluolose ethers, such as ethyl cellulose and ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose. Each alkylene group in the carbonyl C₁ ₇ alkyleneoxy group hereinafter referred to as the CAO group or the poly carbonyl C₁ ₇ alkyleneoxy group hereinafter referred to as the PCAO chain preferably contains from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, an especially preferred alkylene group being pentamethylene wherein the CAO group is 5 oxypentamethylene 1 carbonyl hereinafter referred to as OPMC which is derivable from E caprolactone. The PCAO chain may contain a mixture of alkylene groups of different length but is preferably a homopolymer, especially of OPMC. The PCAO chain or the CAO group may carry a chain stopping terminal group at the free end, such as optionally substituted alkyl, e.g. alkyl, alkoxyalkyl or haloalkyl, where the absence of a terminal hydroxy group prevents formation or further growth of the PCAO chain. The PCAO chain preferably contains from 2 to 100, and more preferably from 3 to 80, CAO groups. The CAO group and PCAO chain can be conveniently represented by the general formula Each CAO group or PCAO chain is preferably linked to the poly C₂ ₄ alkyleneimine hereinafter referred to as PAI through a covalent amide link, formed between a terminal carbonyl group CO of the CAO group or PCAO chain and the nitrogen atom N of a primary or secondary amino group in the PAI, or through an ionic salt link, between a terminal carboxylate group CO O of the CAO group or the PCAO chain and the positively charged nitrogen atom N of a substituted ammonium group in the PAI. Because the dispersant contains at least two CAO groups or PCAO chains it may contain a mixture of amide and salt links depending upon the severity of the conditions under which it is prepared. The dispersant can be conveniently represented by the following general formula The dispersant preferably contains from 4 to 2000 p 4 to 2000 and more preferably from 4 to 1000 p 4 to 1000 CAO groups or PCAO chains. The PAI is preferably a poly ethyleneimine , hereinafter referred to as PEI , which may be branched or straight chained. A preferred dispersant comprises PEI carrying at least two CAO groups or PCAO chains attached thereto by amide and or salt links. The PAI preferably has a weight average molecular weight from 500 to 600,000 and more preferably from 1,000 to 200,000. The dispersant may be derived from a PAI and a CAO acid or a PCAO acid, i.e. a compound of the formula in which n is from 1 to 100, or a cyclic precursor thereof, such as a lactone. The length of the PCAO chain in the PCAO acid may be controlled by the presence of chain stopper, such a carboxylic acid free from hydroxy groups, in the preparative process. Where the dispersant carries PCAO chains formed by the polymerisation of a carbonylalkyleneoxy monomer, such as a lactone, in the presence of the PAI, there is less need for a chain stopper, because the PCAO chains grow on the PAI and cannot react together in such a case the pendant PCAO chains may be terminated by hydroxy groups. The dispersant may be derived from a PAI having at least two primary, secondary or tertiary amino groups, and a CAO or PCAO acid, in which case reaction between a p , s or t amino group in the PAI and a terminal carboxyl group on the CAO or PCAO acid forms an amide or salt link. If the PAI contains a t amino group only salt links can be formed, otherwise salt and or amide links are formed depending on the reaction conditions. Generally, mild reaction conditions such as low temperatures and or short reaction times promote the formation of salt links and more severe conditions, such as high temperatures and or long reaction times promote the formation of amide links in a manner which is familiar to the skilled chemist. The dispersant comprising a PAI chain carrying CAO groups is novel and forms feature of the invention. Each CAO group is preferably terminated by a group which is free from OH NH₂ groups, such as alkylcarbonyl. Termination is conveniently effected by reaction of a CAO acid, or lactone precursor, with a carboxylic acid which is free from hydroxy or amino groups, e.g. an alkane or an alkoxyalkane carboxylic acid, such as caproic acid, lauric acid, stearic acid, methoxyacetic acid and especially by a such an acid containing twelve or more, preferably 12 to 25, carbon atoms. Where the dispersant contains free amino groups these may be converted into substituted ammonium groups by reaction with an acid or a quaternising agent so that the dispersant is in the form of a substituted ammonium salt. Suitable reagents for this purpose are mineral and strong organic acids or acidic salts, such as acetic acid, sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, alkylsulphonic acids, alkyl hydrogen sulphates and arylsulphonic acids, especially acid forms of dyes and pigments, and quaternising agents such as dimethyl sulphate DMS , methyl and ethyl halides and diethyl sulphate DES . Where the solid is an inorganic material, such as an inorganic pigment, extender or filler, it is preferred that the dispersant is in the form of the free amine or a salt with a mineral acid or a quaternary ammonium salt. Where the solid is an organic material, such as an organic pigment or dye, it is often preferred that the dispersant is in the form of a substituted ammonium salt between free amine groups in the PAI portion of the dispersant and an aromatic acid containing from 2 to 10 benzene rings, more especially a coloured acid. Such salts are especially effective dispersants where the organic medium is an alcohol, such as ethanol or iso propanol. By the term coloured acid is meant an organic pigment or dye containing at least one, preferably from 1 to 6, acid groups, especially sulphonic, phosphonic or carboxylic acid groups. It is convenient to use an acid form of the organic pigment which forms the solid in the composition. Thus, a preferred coloured acid for the preparation of a composition in which the solid is a copper phthalocyanine or a similarly deeply coloured pigment, is a copper phthalocyanine sulphonic acid, especially such an acid containing, on average, from 0.5 to 3 sulphonic acids groups per molecule, The dispersant may be prepared by reaction of a PAI with a PCAO acid or precursor thereof, such as a C₁ ₇ alkylenelactone or hydroxy C₁ ₇ alkylenecarboxylic acid at a temperature from 25 C to 250 C for up to 24 hours. Under mild conditions low temperature and or short reaction time salt links are formed and under more severe conditions higher temperature and or longer reaction time amide, or a mixture of amide and salt links are formed. The CAO or PCAO acid may be prepared by heating a hydroxycarboxylic acid or lactone with a carboxylic acid which is free from hydroxy groups, such as acetic acid, caproic acid, lauric acid and methoxyacetic acid. The absence or degree of polymerisation is controlled by the relative proportions of the mono and bifunctional reactants. Reaction is conveniently performed at a temperature from 100 C to 250 C, preferably from 130 C to 200 C, in the presence of an esterification catalyst, such as tetrabutyl titanate, zirconium naphthenate, zinc acetate or toluenesulphonic acid. Where the PAI is PEI, the weight ratio of CAO acid or PCAO acid to PEI is preferably at least 1 1 and is more preferably in the range from 1 1 to 30 1. It is especially preferred, in the case of a dispersant based on PEI and a PCAO acid derived from E caprolactone, that the weight ratio of the PCAO acid to PEI is from 1.5 1 to 30 1. The equivalent molar ratios of the two reactants depends, of course, on their respective average molecular weights. It has been found that a dispersant in which the PCAO chain is fairly short, i.e. containing from 2 to 7 CAO groups mol wt 400 to 1000 and the weight ratio of PCAO to PEI is fairly low, i.e. from 1.5 1 to 3 1, is particularly suitable for use in a dispersion of the solid in an alkanol. It has also been found possible to design a dispersant which is particularly suitable for use in a dispersion of the solid in an ester or a ketone by using a similar PCAO chain i.e. containing 2 to 7 CAO groups and a somewhat higher weight ratio of PCAO to PEI, i.e. from 3 1 to 5 1 or a rather longer PCAO chain containing 7 or more CAO groups i.e. mol wt 1000 or more and a much higher weight ratio of PCAO to PEI, e.g. from 5 1 to 20 1. To minimise degradation of the reactants and products the reactions are preferably performed under an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen.

The resins used were Cargill products 5713 an 80 solids solution in butyl acetate, with viscosity Z4 Z6 and acid number 10 and 5725 an 80 solids solution in EOA, with viscosity Z4 Z5 and acid number 6 . Millbases were prepared in a ball mill, and the mean particle diameter of the pigment after milling was below 5 microns. After milling the millbases were converted into usable paints by the addition of let down lacquer. Details of the mill base and let down lacquers are shown in Table 7. Test panels on tinplate and anodised aluminium were prepared by applying the above paints with a wire wound K bar. Gloss and adhesion were both satisfactory. To evaluate the use of a dispersion in accordance with the present invention in a conventional paint system, the paint described in Example 92 below was prepared. A stoving baking paint system was prepared incorporating a non drying alkyd resin combined with a melamine formaldehyde resin. The alkyd resin used was glycerol based, acid value 7mg.KOH g and is supplied as a 70 solution in xylene by Croda Resins Ltd., under the name PLASTOKYD C 30AX PLASTOKYD is a Registered Trade Mark . The melamine formaldehyde resin used was of the n butylated type, and is supplied as a 60 solution in n butanol by British Industrial Plastics Ltd., under the name BEETLE BE 615 BEETLE is a Registered Trade Mark . The mill base was prepared in a ball mill, and the mean particle diameter of the pigment after milling was below 5 microns. After milling the mill base was converted into a usable paint by the addition of let down lacquers in two stages. Details of the mill base and the let down lacquers are shown in Table 8. Test panels on tinplate and anodised aluminium were prepared by applying the above paints using a wire wound K bar or an air driven spray gun as appropriate. Gloss, adhesion and scratch resistance were all satisfactory. The formulations described in Table 9 below are similar to those used in different types of ceramic tape casting or doctor blade processes. In Examples 93 and 94 typical resin binders and plasticisers are also included in the dispersion formulation. In Examples 95 to 97 only dispersant, solvent s and ceramic powder are included in the dispersion formulation. In Examples 93 to 95, the dispersions were prepared by ball milling the ingredients in a high energy ball mill with 3mm glass balls for 30 minutes. In Examples 96 and 97 the dispersions were prepared by ball milling the ingredients for 16 hours. All the resulting dispersions were fluid and deflocculated.
