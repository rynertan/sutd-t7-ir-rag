## Description
Title Bag Closure. Th.is invention relates to a bag closure, and in particular to a bipartite bag closure, the parts of which each comprise a strip with a handle or hanger member, each strip being attached to an edge of a bag opening, and the strips having cooperating means, distributed along their lengths, for closing th.e bag opening by holding the strips together, and a hinge element being provided at opposite ends of the bag closure. For properly closing a bag equipped with such a closure, it is necessary for the parts of the closure members, which are often press buttons, and generally snap closures, to become fi.rmly i nter engaged. This means, however, that, to open the bag, the halves of the closure must be pulled apart with a considerable force, and it is then virtually inevitable that, at the place where th bag edges connected to the strips meet, such a force is exerted on the bag material as to tear it. This drawback is generally recognized, and various proposals have therefore been made to avoid it.The most elegant of these appears to be to make the bag closure of integral construction, that is to say, to mould the bag closure in one piece to a so called continuous h.andle in which th.e two strips are connected together at their ends. One disadvantage of this is that a relati vely expensive, tripartite die is required with. a movable centre part. It is clear that this adversely affe.cts th.e cost price of the bag closure.. According to another prior proposal Dutch patent application No. 74,08683 S, the handle strip is made of singular construction with two score lines spaced apart a distance corresponding to the. length of the bag opening, with th sum of the lengths projecting on opposite.sides beyond the score lines also corresponding to the length of the bag opening. These projecting strip portiXons can be folded over towards each other about the score lines, and when th free ends are interconnected there is formed a bag closure with. two strips fixedly interconnected at their ends, but one of which carries a coupling member e.g. halfway its length. Not only is this less elegant from an estetic point of view, but the die required for making such a bag closure is relatively expensive., and it is not an easy matter to make dimensional variations. It is observed th.at virtually all of s uch bag closures are intended for plastics bags, which in most cases consist of two rectangular superimposed sheets. interconnected at three of the four edges, with the bag opening and th.e closure strips being at th.e fourth. edge.. Partly depending on the method of mak.ing th.e bags, the closed edges are fold lines or heat sealed seams. In summary it may be stated, generally speakivng, that singular bag closures are relatively expensiMve, and that bipartite closures involve the risk that the Bag material becomes torn during opening. According to French patent 1,426,390, thais drawback can be avoided by ensuring that the ends of the strips remain connected to each other as the bag closure is being pulled open, i.e. that th.e strips never become fully detached from each other. This is realized, according to the French patent, By providing the strips with closure elements not only in the central portion, but also at the ends, of which those at the strip ends remain coupled together under all circumstances and keep th.e end portions of the trips in surface to surface contact with each other. The solution proposed in this French patent, however, introduces another problem. Owing to the fact that the ends of the strips remain flatly pressed together under all circumstances, it is not possible for the bag tothe optimally opened This is a disadvantage, in particular because bags provided with such a closure with a handle or hanger member are required, as a package, to enclose the article to be packed as closely as possible.If the article in question is more or less dimensionally stable, it will be impossible to remove it from the bag without destroying the package, in which case the precaution proposed in the French patent is meanixngless. A bipartite bag closure which does admit of being optimally opened is proposed in French patent 2,Q88,777, in which the closure strips are interconnected at their ends by a hinge element comprising a pin and a sleeve rotatahle about th.e pin. Making such. a hinge by means of the injection mouldiwng process is rather a complicated procedure, while the hinges can hardly prevent the strips from becoming detached from each other when th.e closure has been pulled open. It is an object of the present invention to provide a bag closure which. combi nes the advantagessof bipartite bag closures, i.e. cheap manufacture, with those of the singular or continuous closures described hen before and bipartite closures with hinge elements, namely, the possibility of optimally opening a bag provided with such a closure. For this purpose, according to the invention, a bipartite bag closure as defined in the opening paragraph. of this specification is characterized in that each hinge element is a flexible lip formed on a strip end and adapted to be folded and to be secured to the juxtaposed end of the other strip. The hinge element could be made as a loose.element and be connected to both strip ends but preferably th.e lip is formed as a prolmgation of each strip end and carries a coupling member moiety at its free end, the other moiety of which is arranged on the corresponding end of the other strip. Such a flexible prolongation lip may be provided at its free end with a press. button moiety, the oth.er moiety of which is arranged on the opposite strip end.When the strips are placed in contact with each other and the terminal press button moieties are snapped together there is formed a continuous bag closure, the strip members of which can be pulled apart with great force without it being possible for the terminal press button joints to become detached, because the forces exerted on the strip endsare taken up by the hinging lip. Preferably, each lip connected to a strip end carries a press button moiety, the other moiety of which is arranged on the side of the other strip end facing away from the strip end connected to the lip. Accordingly, in the coupled condition, th.e lip is folded over the strip end connerned, and when the two strips are pulled apart, the forces exerted on the hinge do not tend to open the press button closure, but on the contrary force the one press button moiety into the direction of the other press button moiety, so that the terminal press buttons are effectively prevented from bering opened. Although each strip of the bag closure according to the invention may Be provided on one end with, a lip and at the other end with a press button moiety, it is simpler, from the point of view of manufacturing technique, to provide one strip with a prolongation lip on both ends, and the other strip just with press button moieties at both ends. The prolongation lips may be made thin compared to the strip material, so that they are very flexible.It is thus ensured that the strips can be pressed flatly against each other by the co operatisng closure members virtually throughout their entire length. This is in particular of importance in case th.e package is a display package, and a packed article may be on display for a long period of time. With the bag closure according to the in vention it is ensured that during such. presentation in the shop the packed article cannot be soiled by the ingress of dust and the like. One embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with, reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a plan view of the bag closure according to the invention in the opened condition Fig. 2 shows a perspective view of a detail of a bag equipped with the bag closure shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 is a side elevational view of a bag with closure according to the invention. Referring to the drawings, and in particularFig. 3, a plastics bag 1, comprising two sheets 5 and 6 interconnected by side edges 2 and 3 and a bottom edge 4, has an opening 7 defined by edges 8 and 9, with which the bag is connected, by heat sealing or otherwise, two strips 10. and 11 forming part of a bipartite bag closure.At least one of the strips 10, 11 is equipped with a handle or hanger member 12. Snap closures, such as press buttons, are spaced uniformly over th.e length of the strips, of which Fig. 1 shows spigot moieties 13 on the side of strip 11, and of which the corresponding socket moieties are provided in strip 12. As shown by Figs. 1 and 2, hinge elements in the form of relatively thin, flexible lips 14 are formed at the ends of strip 11 which lips have a spigot press button moiety 15, and socket press button moieties in the form of holes 16 are formed in the ends of strip 10. Opposite to hole 16 in strip 10 another hole 17 may be provided in strip 11, which hole 17 can receive th.e head of press button 15 which. projects through.h.ole 16 when the strip ends lie flat against each oth.er. Fig. 1 clearly shows that the bag can be optimally opened without there being a risk of snap closures 15, 16 becoming detached, and hence of bag edges 2 and 3 being torn. It is clear that various variants of the embodiment shown are possible without departing from the scope of the present invention. Thus lips 14 may be formed not both on one strip, but one on ether, or alternatively loose hinge lips may be used, wh.ich are snap fastened to both strips. It is also possible for press button 15 to engage with strips 10 from the inside.
