## Description
SIMPLIFIED ADJUSTABLE SIZE TIRE CHAIN The invention particularly relates to new and novel tire chain structures of the type having non metallic interconnectors for the cross chains.Background of the invention Conventional tire chains are heavy, difficult to mount upon the tire, and are difficult to tighten upon the tire so that they often remain loose and subject to banging against the fender of the vehicle in a most unsatisfactory and disturbing manner, subjecting the chain to breakage, subjecting the vehicle to damage, and often limiting the maximum speed of the vehicle while the chains are mounted. Because of all of these disadvantages, various proposals have been made in the past for vehicle tire chain structures employing non metallic connectors between the cross chains. A number of such structures have been devised by the present inventor, as shown in his prior U.S. Patents 3,856,069, 3,858,634, 3,970,132, and 4,185,674 issued January 29, 1980. The present invention represents an improvement over those prior structures. One of the major problems in all tire chain structures, including structures employing non metallic cross chain connectors, is to provide for ease of ad justment in the size of the tire chain structure to exactly fit a particular tire, without requiring an infinite number of different sizes to fit all of the different tire sizes. Another closely related problem is that of tightening the tire chain structure after it is assembled upon the tire. Accordingly, it is a major object of the present invention to provide improved and simplified means for adjusting the size and tightness of vehicle tire chain structures having non metallic connectors for the cross chains.Summary of the Invention In carrying out the invention there is provided an adjustable size tire chain structure comprising a plurality of metal cross chains, an inboard rope connector for interconnection with the inboard ends of said cross chains, an outboard rope connector for interconnection with the outboard ends of said cross chains, a combined rope to cross chain connecting link and rope clamping ring and rope connector adjustment device provided at each end of each cross chain for connection to said inboard and outboard rope connectors, each of said connecting links comprising a substantially V shaped wire body with a loop formed at each end of the V, said wire body being connected to the associated cross chain end by linking through the end link at the bottom of the V, said loops each being engaged with the associated one of said rope connectors by at least partially surrounding. the rope connector, at least one of said loops being dimensioned and arranged to partially surround and slidably engage said rope, at least one of said slidably engaged loops being open sufficiently to permit the rope to be slipped out of and into said loop, at least one collar clamped to said rope at a position upon said rope in the vicinity of each of said connecting links, said collar being sufficiently large to prevent the portion of the rope to which the collar is clamped from sliding through an associated one of said slidably engaged loops, said collar being operable when positioned inside the associated loop of said link to shorten the rope by forming a loop of rope between said loops of said link and means for holding the other side of said loop of rope at the other loop of said link to maintain said loop of rope between said loops of said link.Brief Description of the Drawings FIG. 1 is a side view of the simplified adjustable size tire chain as it appears when installed on a tire.

FIGS. 10, 11, and 12 disclose a modified version of the connecting link of FIGS. 2, 3 and 4 and the rope connector associated therewith.Description of Preferred Embodiments A preferred embodiment of the adjustable size tire chain structure of the present invention is shown in assez. bled forn. upon 2 tire 8 in FIG. 1. As shown, the preferred structure preferably includes a plurality of metal chains 10, an inboard rope connector 12 for interconnection witittheinboard ends o cross chains 10 and an outboard rope connector 14 for inter connection with the outboard ends of the cross chains 10.The inboard rope connector 12 is shown only in a cutaway portion of the tire 8. FIG. 1 is a view of the tire 8 from the outboard side. A connecting link 16 is provided at each end of each cross chain 10 for connection to the inboard and outboard rope connectors 12 and 14. The connecting link 16 is really a combined rope to cross chain connecting link and rope clamping ring and rope connection adjustment device, as will appear from the following detailed description. The connecting links 16 are each connected to an associated end link 11 of the cross chains 10 by threading through the end link 11. The respective ends of each of the inboard and outboard rope connectors are provided with metal wire interconnection hooks 18 and 20 to enable these ends to be interconnected as the chain structure is assembled upon the tire 8. A spreader rope 22 is connected around the outboard rope connector 14 to provide a final tightening of the outboard rope connector 14, and to thereby tighten the entire chain structure. The spreader rope 22 is preferably interconnected with the outboard rope connector 14 by means of spreader hooks 24, with at least one spreader hook 24 being connected to each segment of the outboard rope connector 14 between adjacent connecting links 16. As shown in the drawing, two spreader hooks may preferably be provided on the opposite sides of the interconnection hooks 18 and 20, although that is not essential. The tightening provided by the spreader rope 22 tightens the entire structure so that no spreader rope is required for the inboard rope connector 12. As shown in the drawing, the spreader rope 22 is provided with end hooks 26 at each end, and an intermediate connector hook 28. The spreader rope 22 is arranged circumferentially around the outboard rope connector, and one of the spreader end hooks 26 is connected to the intermediate connector hook 28. The other end of the spreader rope 22 is tightened by means of a locking ring 30 associated with the intermediate connector hook 28 by pulling the spreader rope tightly through the intermediate connector hook 28 and the locking ring 30. The loose end of the spreader rope 22 may then be connected diagonally across the array formed by the rope connector 14 and the spreader rope 22, as shown at 33, and doubled back, as shown at 35, with the spreader end hook 26 connected to one of the spreader hooks 24, or to the body of the spreader, to maintain the entire assembly in a tight condition. FIG. 2 is an enlarged detail view of the connecting link 16, showing how that connecting link is attached to the end link 11, and illustrating how the connecting link is attached to the outboard rope connector 14. The structure is exactly the same for the interconnection of the connecting links 16 to the inboard rope connector 12.FIGS. 3, 4, and 5 all illustrate different aspects of the connecting link 16 and its relationship to the rope connector 14. As illustrated in FIG. 2, the connecting link 16 is in the form of a substantially V shaped wire body with individual loops 32 and 34 formed at the respective ends of the V. The mid portion of the V is engaged with the end link 11 of the associated cross chain 10. As shown in FIG. 2, the V is inverted. Each of the end loops 32 and 34 is formed in a plane substantially perpendicular to the plane of the V. Thus, in FIG. 2, the plane of the V is substantially parallel to the plane of the surface of the paper, and the planes of the loops 32 and 34 are substantially perpendicular to the plane of the paper. This relationship, and the construction of the loops 32 and 34 can be appreciated a little better from the perspective view of FIG. 4. The loops 32 and 34 are arranged to engage and embrace the rope connector 14 by at least partially surrounding the rope of the rope connector. Loop 32 is securely clamped to the rope connector 14 so as to prevent any movement or sliding of the rope 14 through loop 32. For this purpose, loop 32 preferably substantially completely surrounds the body of the rope 14. By contrast, loop 34 is dimensioned and arranged to only partially surround and slidably engage the body of the rope 14. Loop 34 is open sufficiently to permit the rope to be slipped out of and into loop 34 for twn different purposes, as will be described immediately below. A collar ring 36 is tightly fixed to the body of the rope, as illustrated in each of the FIGS. 2, 3, 4, and 5. Collar 36 may simply consist of an open wire ring which is securely clamped to the body of the rope 14.When the rope connector 14 is to be shortened, the rope connector is gathered into a loop, as indicated at 38, and the body of the rope connector is then slipped into the loop 34 with the collar 36 on the inside of the loop 34 of the connecting link 16, as illustrated in FIG. 2. In this position, when the rope connector 14 is under tension, the collar 36 prevents the body of the rope connector 14 from sliding through the loop 34, thus maintaining the rope loop 38. The rope loop 38 cannot be released by sliding the body of the rope connector 14 through loop 32 because the body of rope 14 is tightly clamped by loop 32 to prevent any sliding motion. If the rope connector 14 is to be lengthened, the body of the rope 14 is slipped out of the opening of loop 34 by an upward movement, the rope loop 38 is straightened out, and the body of the rope connector 14 is again inserted into the loop 34, as shown in FIG. 3. Thus, the rope connector 14 is lengthened by the amount of rope released by the release of loop 38. This operation is further illustrated in the perspective view of FIG. 4, where the rope connector 14 is shown in full after release from the loop 34, and is shown in phantom after reinsertion into the loop 34. Since the body of the rope 14 is slidably engaged within the loop 34, any tendency of the rope to retain the rope loop 38 is overcome by the longitudinal tension on the rope connector 14. If it is desired to again shorten the rope connector, the process can be reversed. Thus, the rope body can be slipped out of the loop 34, as shown in FIG. 4, and then the rope body may be slipped back into the loop 34 with the collar 36 inside the loop 34, as pictured in FIG. 2. It may be said that the collar 36 is clamped to the rope at a position upon the rope on the side of the slidably engaged loop 34 opposite to the side of the firmly clamped loop 32 when the rope is stretched from the clamped loop to the collar. This represents the condition illustrated in full lines in FIG. 4. However, the collar 36 is sufficiently large to prevent the rope from sliding through the slidably engaged loop 34 when the rope is placed into the slidably engaged loop 34 with the collar 36 on the side of the slidably engaged loop 34 facing the clamped loop 32. This maintains the rope loop 38 between the clamped loop 32 and the slidably engaged loop 34 to thereby shorten the rope connector. Therefore, as described above, the connecting link 16 provides the combined functions of connecting the rope connector 34 to the cross chain 10, clamping the rope connector 14 effectively to the cross chain 10 by the firm clamping of loop 32, and providing a rope connector adjustment device in terms of the feature just described for maintaining or eliminating the rope loop 38. The firm clamping of the clamped loop 32 serves to maintain the exact position of the connecting link upon the rope connector 14 so as to maintain the different connecting links in proper spaced relationship with one another. This serves to assist in positioning the chain cross links 10 appropriately around the tire. FIG. 5 illustrates another major feature and advantage of the structure of the connecting link 16. Thus, while the body of the rope connector 14 is out of the loop 34, the end of the connecting link 16, including the loop 34, may be threaded in and out of the end link 11 of the cross chain 10 to permit the cross chain 10 to be replaced with a new chain, or to reverse the cross chain 10 to distribute the wear upon the cross chain. This can be easily accomplished without the necessity for the use of any tools. This is the second purpose for which the body of the rope connector may be slipped out of the end loop 34, to change or reverse the cross chain 10. This feature not only permits ease in changing or reversing the cross chains, but also provides for great ease in the initial assembly of the tire chain structure. FIGS. 6, 7, 8, and 9 disclose another novel feature of the invention and of a method for carrying out that feature. The rope connectors 14 are preferably composed of thermoplastic synthetic resin fibers such as polypropylene.The end hooks, such as end hook 20, for interconnecting the ends of the rope connectors 12 and 14 are attached to the rope connector ends by a process illustrated in stepwise fashion in FIGS. 6, 7, 8, and 9. First, the end of the rope connector 14 is slipped into a hook loop 40 formed at one end of the hook 20, as shown in FIG. 6. Next, as illustrated in FIG. 7, the hook loop 40 is firmly clamped to the body of the rope connector 14. AS illustrated in FIG. 8, in the next step, a heated implement such as a soldering iron 42 is then forcefully applied to the end of the thermoplastic rope 14, fusinq the ends of the fibers of the rope together, and upsetting and enlarging the end of the rope so as to make it impossible for the end of the rope to slip out of the clamp loop 40. FIG. 9 illustrates the completed assembly, with the fused and upset end of the polypropylene rope indicated at 44. While a soldering iron 42 is illustrated as the heating and upsetting tool in FIG. 8, it will be understood that any suitable heating implement may be employed for the purpose. For instance, the combination of the hook 20 and the end of the rope connector 14 can be grasped by means of a pair of pliers, or by means of an automatic fixture, and forceably pressed against the surface of an electric hotplate, the hotplate then providing the function of the heating and upsetting tool. The hook 20 is preferably composed of steel, but other materials may also be employed for this purpose. The basic method of assembly of the entire chain structure preferably includes the steps of prefabricating the required number of the V shaped wire body connecting links 16, including forming the loops 32 and 34 at each end of the V of each of the connecting links 16, and attaching equal numbers of the connecting links to the inboard and outboard rope connectors 12 and 14. The attachment of the connecting links to the inboard and outboard rope connectors is carried out by inserting the body of the rope connector into loop 32 of each of the associated connecting links, with the associated connecting links substantially equally spaced along each rope connector. Loop 32 is then firmly closed on each connecting link to firmly clamp the rope within that loop.The separate collar 36 is then clamped at a position upon each rope connector adjacent to each connecting link on the side of the unclamped loop 34 facing away from the clamped loop 32. Each connecting link is then attached to one end of each member of a group of cross chains 10 by threading the unclamped loop 34 through the end link 11 of the cross chain. Each connecting link associated with the other one of the rope connectors is then connected in the same manner to the other end of each of the cross chains 10.The body of each rope connector is then slid into the unclamped loop 34 of each associated connecting link with the collar 36 being selectively placed on the side of the unclamped loot 34 facing the clanked loop 32 to shorten the rope connector by maintaining the rope loop 38, or with the collar 36 on the other side of the unclamped loop 34 when the rope connector need not be shortened. FIGS. 10, 11, and 12 present a minor modification of the structure of the connectin link 16 previously illustrated and described in connection with FIGS. 2, 3, and 4. In FIGS. 10, 11, and 12, the parts of the previously described Connecting link structure, and associated rope, are given the same numbers, but with the suffix letter A . The main difference in the embodiment of FIGS. 10, 11, and 12 is that the loo 32A of the connecting link 15A is not securely clamped to the rope connector 14A, but is demensioned and arranged to only partially surround an to slidably engage the body of the rope 14A, as previously described above for loop 34. Thus, loops 32A and 34A are substantially identical, permitting a sliding engagement with the rope 14A, and preferably permitting insertion or removal of the rope, when desired. However, in order to maintain the longitudinal position of the rope 14A within the connecting link 16A, two ad ditional collars 46 ind 48 are provided, as best illustrated in FIG. 11. The collars 46 and 48 are securely clamped to the rope 14A, as previously described above with respect to the collar 36. As illustrated in FIG. 11, when the section of rope between the loops 32A and 34A is straight, the two collars 46 and 48 are positioned inside the respective loops 32A and 34A to prevent longitudinal movement of the rope 14A wth respect to the link 16A.However, as illustrated in FIG. 10, when both of the outer collars 46 and 3 A are positioned inside the loops 32A and 34 ., a loop of rope 38A is formed between loops 32A and 34A of the connecting link 16A to thereby shorten the rope. The collars 46 and 36A are sometimes referred to below as outer collars, and the collar 48 as a middle collar. In the method of assembly of the mociried connecting links 16A of PIGS. 10, 11, and 12, the connecting link 159 may first be connected to the end link 11 of the cross chain, and then connected to the appropriate section of the rope 14A. Alternatively, one of the loops 32A may be connected to the rope 14A, and then the other side of the connecting link 16A can be threaded through the end link 11 of the cross chain, and then fastened to the rope 14A. While this invention has been shown and described In connection with particular preferred emb din Qnts, it is apparent that various changes and modirications, in addition to those mentioned above, may be made by those who are skilled in the art without departing from the basic feetwres of the invention. Accordingly, it is the intention of the applicant to protect all variations and modifications within the true spirit and valid scope of this invention.
