# Photographic element containing a polymeric mordant comprising quaternized vinylimidazole and acrylonitrile recurring units.

## Abstract
A photographic element and its use in diffusion transfer photography are described which contain a novel mordant comprising recurring units having the formula CHEM wherein A represents recurring units derived from one or more alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monomers R represents hydrogen or methyl each R 1 independently represents hydrogen or an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms Q represents an alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or substituted aryl group X represents an anion w is from 0 to 25 mole percent x is from 30 to 90 mole percent y is from 8 to 65 mole percent and z is from 2 to 9 mole percent
