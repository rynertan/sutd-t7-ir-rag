# Submarine optical fibres telecommunication line.

## Abstract
The submarine line for optical fibres telecommunications, comprises two optical fibres cables 1, 2 , and an optoelectronic repeater 3 , interposed between them. The optoelectronic repeater 3 has its component parts encased in a watertight casing 4 that, in this turn, is enclosed in a metallic box 13 whose bases are provided with apertures, facing towards the cables. The apertures of the metallic box 13 are sealingly closed by cylindrical bodies 22 by means of which there is realized both, the mechanical connection between the box 13 and the armouring of each cable 1, 2 formed by a rope 34 embedded in it, as well as the connection between the optical fibres 37 and the conductors of the cables, and the extremities of the optical fibres 5 and of the electrical conductor 6 of the optoelectronic repeater 3 .
