# Fuse.

## Abstract
A fuse comprising a fuse element arranged between two terminals in an envelope which supports the structure, the fuse element consisting essentially of an appropriate electri cally conductive material and being on opposite ends in contact with the terminals, whereas the envelope consists at least in part of ablative material, which material dissociates at high temperature at least at its surface to release gas which suppresses arcing when the fuse element blows, so that a particulate arc suppressing filling is superfluous.
