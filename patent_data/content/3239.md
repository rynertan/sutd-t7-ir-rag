## Description
This invention relates to inhibiting electrical break down by water treeing in dielectric materials which are based on ethylene polymers.Compositions based on polyolefins are well known and they are, used extensively as insulation materials for wire and amble. As insulation materials, properties of the composition such as intrinsic electrical strength, corona resistance and resistance to treeing are important.Intrinsic electrical breakdown is the catastrophic failure of a dielectric accompanied by arcing or discharge through an ionized channel in the dielectric. The intrinsic dielectric strength is considered to be an inherent property of the dielectric material.In power cable applications for transmitting relatively high voltage loads such as 5KV and above, corona may be a problem because it may lead to the premature breakdown of the cable insulation. Corona is an electrical plasma resulting from the ionization of a gaseous dielectric in regions of high electrical field. Corona resistance is the ability of a dielectric to withstand the corrosive action of an electrics field. Corona resistance is the ability of a dielectric to withstand the corrosive action of an electrical plasma in contact with it.When used as a high voltage power cable insulation, olefin base compositions undergo a prebreakdown phenomenon known as treeing. This type of damage progresses through a dielectric section under electrical stress so that, if visible its path looks something like a tree. Treeing can occur and progress slowly by periodic partial discharge, it may occur slowly in the presence of moisture without any partial discharge, or it may occur rapidly as the result of an impulse voltage. Trees may form at sites of high electrical stress such as contaminarrts or voids in the body of the insulation or at irregularities at the insulationsemiconductive screen interface. In solid organic dielectrics treeing is the most likely mechanism of electrical failures which do not occur catastrophically, but rather appear to be the result of a more lengthy process. It is desired to extend the service liefe of olefin insulated cables by modification of the insulating materials so that trees are initiated at higher voltages than usual or so that the rate of growth of trees is reduced once initiated.Electrical treeing results from internal electrical discharges which decompose the dielectric. Although high voltage impulses can produce electrical trees, and the presence internal voids and contaminants is undesirable, the damage which results from application of moderate a.c.voltages to electrode insulation interfaces which contain imperfections is more commercially significant. In this case very high, localized stress gradients can exist and with sufficient time lead to initiation and growth of trees which may be followed by breakdown. An example of this is a high voltage power cable or connector with a rough interface between the conductor or conductor shield and the primary insulator. The failure mechanism involves actual breakdown of the modular structure of the dielectric material perhaps by electron bombardment. Much of the prior art is concerned with the inhibition of electrical trees.Water treeing is a deterioration of a solid dielectric material which is simultaneously exposed to moisture and an electric field. It is a significant factor in determing the useful life of buried high voltage power cables. Water trees initiate from sites of high electrical stress such s rough interfaces, protruding conductive points, voids, oi imbedded contaminants but at a lower field than that requlreci for electrical trees.In contrast to electrical trees, wa r trees are characterized by a the presence of water is essential for their growth b no partial discharge is normally detected during their growth c they can grow for years before reaching a size where they may contribute to a breakdown d although slow growing, they are initiated and grow in much lower electrical fields than those required for the development of electrical trees.Thus, intrinsic electrical breakdown, failure by corona, electrical treeing and water treeing are different and the mechanisms for each are different. It follows that a different solution is required to effect improvement in a dielectric material for each mode of failure involved.Additionally, it is known that when crosslinked olefin polymers, particularly polyethylene, are used for power cable insulation, a crosslinking agent may function as a water treeing inhibitor. When dicumyl peroxide is used as the crosslinking agent in polyethylene, for example, the peroxide residue functions as a tree inhibitor for some time after curing. However, these residues are eventually lost at the temperatures of cable service. Therefore, in order to be an effective water treeing inhibitor an additive must be such that it is retained in the olefin composition at the temperature of cable service.It has now been found that dielectric compositions based on ethylene polymers and used as insulation materials in high voltage wire and cable are protected from water treeing under long term use under high voltage conditions, if the composition contains as a water treeing inhibitor, one or more organo silanes.The organo silanes of the present invention have excellent compatibility with ethylene polymers, high retention under cable service temperatures, and resistance to water tree growth.An obJect of the present invention is to provide a process for employing dielectric materials as insualtion in high voltage wire and cable while protecting such dielectric material against water treeing. Another obJect of the present invention is to provide dielectric materials which are resistant to water treeing in high voltage wire and cable and which retain this resistance under the conditions of use of the wire and cable.A further obJect of the present invention is to provide a high voltage wire and cable which is resistant to water treeing.These and other obJects are achieved by employing certain organo silane compounds as water treeing inhibitors in combination with ethylene polymers in the dielectric insulation compositions of the present invention.The Dielectric CompositionThe dielectric composition of the present invention comprise in weight ratio, 100 parts by weight of ethylene polymer, as described below, and about 0.1 to 10, and preferably, about 0.5 to 3.0, parts by weight of at least one of the organo silane compounds which are also described below.Ethylene PolymerThe ethylene polymers which are used in the compositions of the present invention are solid at 250C materials which may be homopolymers, or copolymers of ethylene. The ethylene copolymers contain at least 30 weight percent of ethylene and up to about 70 weight percent of propylene, and or up to about 50 weight percent of one or more other organic compounds which are interpolymerizable with ethylene.

These other interpolymerizable compounds may be hydrocarbon compounds such as, butene 1, pentene 1, isoprene, butadiene, bicycloheptene, bicycloheptadiene, and styrene, as well as vinyl compounds such as vinyl acetate and ethyl acrylate.

These organo silanes are prepared by reacting either an aldehyde or a ketone with an aminoalkylsilane as set forth in, for example, U.S. Patent 2,942, 019, which is incorporated herein by reference.The preferred organo silanes are derived from N B aminoethy. aminopropyltrime thoxy silane and aminopropyltriethoxy silane. Adjutants In addition to the ethylene polymer and the organo silane, the dielectric compositions of the present invention may also include crosslinking agents where the dielectric composition is to be used as a vulcanized composition rather than as a thermoplastic composition, and it is to be chemically crosslinked. These chemical vulcanizing, curing or crosslinking agents are well known to those in the art and include the organic peroxide type of crosslinking agents which are disclosed for example, in United States Patents 2,826,570, 2,888,424, 2,916,481, 3,079,370 and 3,296,189, the disclosures in such patents being incorporated herein by reference. The chemical crosslinking agents may be used individually or in combination with one another, and they are used in crosslinking effective amounts.The preferred crosslinking agent is di X cumyl peroxide. The dielectric compositions of the present invention also advantageously include one or more suitable high temperature antioxidants for the ethylene pblymer in such compositions.The antioxidants include sterically hindered phenols or amines.

The organo silanes may be prepared in advance or in situ during the compounding step by adding appropriate quantities of aldehyd or ketone and aminosilane. A separate preparation step may be used for less reactive ketones, and a catalyst such as ammonium chloride can be used.After the various components of the compositions of the present invention are uniformly admixed and blended together they are further processed, in accordance with the process of the present invention, in conventional extrusion apparatu at about 1200 to 1600C for cross linkable compositions and about 200 C for thermoplastic compositions.After being extruded onto a wire or cable, or other substrat the cross linkable compositions of the present invention are vulcanized at elevated temperatures of about 180 0C and preferably at 215 2300C using conventional vulcanizing procedures.Evaluation of Organo Silane Water Treing Inhibitors inDielectric CompositionsIn order to determine the utility and effectiveness of the water treeing stabilized dielectric compositions of the present invention, the compositions were evaluated with the organo silanes incorporated therein by use of an accelerated water tree test which incorporates a combination of frequently acceleration and a standard defect specimen. The test utilizes a compression molded dish shaped specimen having 24 conical depressions molded into the bottom. Figure 1 shows a cross sectional view of the specimen, where a is 152.4 millimeters, b is 25.4 millimeters and c is 19.05 millimeters. The conical depression, W, of Figure 1 is magnified in Figure IA where d is 3.18 millimeters, e is 60 degrees, f is 3.18 millimeters, g is 6.35 millimeters and the tip radius is about 5 pm. The calculated maximum field is about 250 kv mm in a typical 15 kv power cable.When testing these specimens, 100 ml. of an electrolyte solution is poured into the dish which is then placed into a grounded bath, usually containing the same electrolyte solution. A 50 millimeter diameter platinum wire ring is then immersed in the electrolyte in the dish and connected to the voltage source.Preliminary experiments at 8.5 kHz showed that electrical treeing followed by breakdown rapidly occurred at test voltages of 1Okv or above. In order to limit the study to the effects of water treeing, the voltage used in the examples was 5 kv. Under these conditions a low density polyethylene specimen will develop water trees at the tips of the conical depressions between 120 and 240 micrometers in length in 24 hours using 0.01 N NaCl in distilled water as the electrolyte solution.To facilitate study of the water trees found, each of the twelve conical depressions nearest the center of the specimen is punched out using a 12.7 millimeter 1 2 inch circular die and an arbor press. The resulting discs are placed in a boiling solution of 0.50 g methylene blue and 8 milliliter concentrated aqueous ammonia 28 approx. in 250 milliliters distilled water for 30 minutes. The discs are then sectioned and mounted on microscope slides for examination. Specimens prepared in this way have been kept for periods up to two years without apparent deterioration of the appearance of water trees.A typical water tree grown for 24 hours in low density polyethylene under the above conditions and stained as described, is depicted in Figure 2. The growth occurs in an approximately hemispherical region centered on the tip of the cone, which is usually heavily obscured. Because of this, the most satisfactory direction for measuring the extent of tree growth was found to be perpendicular to the side of the cone as indicated in Figure 2. In our procedure all twelve of the stained trees from the central group of conical depressions are measured and the average length calculated.The rate of growth of water trees, dL, varies from their initiation, when the growth rate is quite fast, to a much slower rate after they have grown large. The data are fit by the empirical equation shown below. 0.0240t .606 or equivalently 2 dL 1.54 dt 0.000323 L where L is the length of the growing tree and t is the time at which the measurement is taken, in hours.If one assumes that water trees are relatively conductive compared to polyethylene, one can calculate the electrical field, E, at the boundry of a growing tree from equation 3 which was derived for the point to point geometry of the present test method.EMI10.1 where V is the voltage applied to the electrolyte in the specimen dish, r the point electrode radius, is identified with L, the length of the growing tree, and d is 3.175 mm L, the distance to the ground electrode. A graph of experimentally measured tree growth rates, dL dt, plotted as a function of E2, calculated by equation 3, is given inFigure 3. The straight line passing through the data points is the graph of the equation 4 dL k E2 where k is the rate constant for water treeing, and has the value of 2.47 x 10 11 mm hr V2 mm2 for this experiment. Since E is known as a function of L from equation 3, one can numerically integrate the following equation 5 5 dL k dt E to provide a value for the rate constant for treeing from an individual measurement of tree length.EMI11.1 wherein dL, E, V, r, d and t are as previously defined.The following examples are merely illustrative of the scope of the present invention and are not intended as a limitation upon the scope thereof.General Admixing ProcedureThe dielectric compositions used in the Examples below were all prepared according to the following Procedure A Procedure APolyethylene homopolymer of 0.2 dg min Melt Index and 0.92 g cc density, or ethylene olfin copolymer of 0.8 dg minMelt Index and density of 0.92 g cc, organo silane and antloxidant are charged to a Banbury mixer and compounded to a malt temperature of approximately 140 C. The resulting com osition was then sheeted on a 2 roll mill, granulated and compression molded into test specimens, as heretofore described, at approximately 1650C. Water Tree Growth Rate hereinafter WTGR is the ratio of rate for the test composition to that of a control. The controls are a commercial grade of high molecular weight polyethylene having a Melt Index of 0.2 dg mlnute and a density of 0.918 grams cubic centimeter and containing 0.10 percent of 4,4 thiobis 3 methyl 6 tert butyl phenol antioxidant Control A or an ethylene butene 1 copolymer havinÖ a Melt Index of 0.8 dg minute and a density of 0.92 grams cubic centimeter and containing 0.10 percent of thiodiethylene bis 3,5 ditert butyl 4 hydroxy hydrocinnamate anitoxidant Control B . The ingredients of these Controls were mixed according to Procedure A, but without organo silane additive.The water tree growth rate was obtained by measuring the length of water trees formed in 24 hours and calculating the absolute rate of tree growth, as heretofore described by equations 1 to 7 . Relative values of 1.0 and 1.03 for water tree growth rate were assigned to Control A and Control B respectively.Example IThis Example illustrates the formation of the organo silane in situ by adding an aldehyde and amino silane to the polyethylene in the compounding step. The following were charged to a Banbury mixer 28 pounds of the polyethylene of Control A, 122.4 grams of benzaldehyde and 256 grams of N f3 aminoethyl y aminopropyl I trimethoxysilane Mixing was conducted until the melt temperature reached 325 0F, after which the charge was dropped to a conventional extruder, stranded and diced. A water tree test specimen was molded at 165 C. as heretofore described. Water tree growth rate was obtained by measuring the length of water trees formed in 24 hours. Relative rates of tree growth were calculated as heretofore described by equations 1 to 7 .The data are su narized in Table I. Example 2Example I was exactly repeated except that after compounding the composition was placed in a vacuum oven at 75 0C for 48 hours. WTGR is listed in Table I.Example 3 to 5Compositions were prepared according to Procedure A by compounding in a laboratory Brabender mixer The polyethyle n homopolymer and antioxidant of Control A and organo silane.The organo silane additives were formed in situ as inExample I. Relative rates of water tree growth were calculated ed as heretofore described in equations 1 to 7 . The reactants used to produce the organo slilane, as well as the concentrations and the WTGR are as set forth in Table I.Example 6This Example illustrates the formation of the organo silane by prereacting a ketone with an aminosilane and adding this reaction product to the polymer. The organo ila ne was prepared by reacting acetophenone and aminotriethoxy silane in the presence of ammonium chloride catalyst.1.5 weight percent of the organo silane so prepared was added to the polyethylene of Control A in a laboratory Banbury mixer according to Procedure A. The WTGR after placing the composition in a vacuum oven at 75 C for 48 hours was 0.21.This Example shows that heating under a vacuum does not reduce water treeing resistance as shown by the low value for WTGR.
