# Adjustable multiple row harvester head assembly.

## Abstract
An adjustable multiple row head 10 for a crop harvester has a plurality of row head units 12,14,16 , each with a cantilevered support arm 56,58,60 , at lest one unit including a movable frame member 44,48 being adjustably mounted on its cantilevered support arm and carrying gathering means 24,26 forming an inlet and a passageway for crops being harvested, whereby the inlets 13,15,17 can be spaced apart by infinitely variable displacement. This construction avoids the use of separate fastens for the row units and cross structures where crop grasses and trash can accumulate, and enables the harvested crop to be discharged into a cutter mechanism at essentially constant points and with constant orientations.
