# RAPID FLASH LAMP

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for providing low peak time and pluse width actinic energy from a lamp by varying the input energy of a capacitive ignition having relatively high voltage to the lamp. The lamp comprises a pair of elec trodes disposed within a light transparent envelope in which a combustible and an oxidizing gas reaction combi nation is located. The combustible is preferably shredded zirconium which is in contact with and provides an electrical discharge path between the electrodes. The gas is prefer ably pressurized oxygen.
