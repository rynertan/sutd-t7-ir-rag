# Welding gun apparatus.

## Abstract
A welding gun is connected by a cable 22 to a connector block 24 for the supply of welding wire, welding current and shielding gas to the gun. The connector block 24 has a connector plug 26 with inlets 76, 78 for the gas. The welding wire is guided through a coiled wire 52 in a sheath 41 . The coiled wire is terminated in a collar 38 . In order to provide a seal for the shielding gas, a front, thin walled portion 47 of the collar 38 is a tight fit in the connector plug 26 and is internally abutted by the sheath 41 of the coiled wire guide 50 .
