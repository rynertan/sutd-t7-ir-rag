# Method and apparatus for automatically spacing characters during composition.

## Abstract
In a computer implemented system for composing lines of text the spacing between each adjacent pair of characters is uniquely determined by processing, in accordance with a pregiven program, a number of digital space values related to the shapes of the facing sides of the involved characters. Starting with a uniform or near uniform fun damental spacing between all adjacent pairs of characters the processing of the space values of a given pair of adjacent characters results in possible adjustments in this fundamen tal value to achieve a more aesthetically pleasing line of text. For each pair of adjacent characters the processing is a two stage one with the first stage making an adjustment in the fundamental spacing if it is possible to overlap portions of the two characters and with the second stage making an adjustment which, aside from the possibility of overlapping, is dependent on the degree of openness or empty space present between the characters when fundamental spacing is used.
