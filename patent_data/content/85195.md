## Description
Method of applying a strain gauge and assembly manufactured accordingly.The invention relates to a method of applying a strain gauge onto a surface of a metal body to be stressed, the strain gauge having insulated conductors extending therefrom, the method comprising the steps of finishing an appropriate area of the said surface for spaciously accomodating the said strain gauge, cleaning said finished area, cementing within said finished area the said strain gauge onto the metal body surface, covering the said strain gauge and a proximal part of each of the insulated conductors with a sealing device.The invention further relates to an assembly for measuring strain in a surface area of metal comprising a strain gauge cemented to the metal at said area, said strain gauge comprising a set of insulated electrical conductors extending therefrom and a sealing device covering the strain gauge, the proximal parts of the insulated electrical conductors and a portion of the finished metal surface area adjacent to and enclosing the said strain gauge, said sealing device being bonded to said surface area portion, the electrical conductors extending through said sealing device. A similar method and assembly implement a protection of a strain gauge in situ. A protective method and an assembly manufactured according to said protection method are known in accordance withU.S. patent 3 089 107 providing for protection against wear and shearing stress in addition to a moisture seal. The metal body.contemplated in this prior art disclosure is a submerged installation, e.g. the hull of a ship, and of considerable stiffness.In a different environment the utilization of strain gauges equally appears to be hampered by penetrating moisture as is the case with load sensitive elements in load cells being used in weighing devices. A load sensitive element comprises one or more zones, wherein deflection due to loading is monitored by strain gauges being aptly connected to the surface of the said element.When it is required to have the drift of a weighing device confined within a range of 300 parts per million it appears to be unsatisfactory to use strain gauges e.g. having an epoxy backing.Epoxy resin backings are normally preferred because of their characteristic indifference for penetrating moisture. However, under these circumstances the swelling of the epoxy resin backing, as a result of penetrating moisture, consumes a substantial portion of the drift being allowable. Contemplating the prior art moisture protection device, however, raised a further problem. The protective assembly should not interfere with the pliability of the sensitive zones of the load sensitive element. These zones in fact have a substantially lower level of stiffness than a ship s hull or the skin of any other submerged body.The invention provides a solution for the problem to provide a moisture proof casing for a strain gauge of the type specified in the preamble which is pliable to such an extent that the sensitivity and the accuracy of a load sensitive element in a load cell remains unimpaired.An advantage offered by the invention is that it provides a durable sealing device, not shortening the life of a weighing device comprising a load cell in which the strain gauges are sealed accordingly.One specific embodiment of the invention is described in detail below with reference to a drawing in whichFig. 1 is a plan view of a surface of a load sensitive element carrying a strain gauge assembly according to the invention.Fig. 2 is a view of a section of an assembly according to the invention following Il Il in figure 1.The figures show a mounted strain gauge assembly for load sensitive elements comprising on a surface 1 of an element body 2 a strain gauge 3 cemented within a grit blasted portion 4 of a finished area of said surface. This area portion 4 is of a slightly wider size than the strain gauge 3. Two lead wires 5, 6 extend from the strain gauge. The proximal parts 5 , 6 of these lead wires and the strain gauge 3 itself are covered by a thin layer 7 of a nitrile rubber being applied by brushing a nitrile rubber solution in a volatile solvent over the strain gauge, the proximal part 5 , 6 and a portion of the surface area after thoroughly cleaning same.The said surface area portion extends across imaginary border lines 8, 9, 10 and 11 enclosing an area of at least nine times the area of the strain gauge 3, thus extending from said strain gauge over at least its corresponding width and length. A butyl rubber film 12 is applied onto the dried thin layer 7 by pressing, covering at least the area enclosed by the border lines 8, 9, 10 and 11. The thin layer 7 is amply applied so that the film 12 is separated from the surface 1 by the layer 7 over its entire length and width. The lead wires 5, 6 emerge from the thin layer 7 outside the film 12.The nitrile rubber used in a successful example of the above embodiment was an M Coat BT air drying nitrile rubber coating manufactured by Micro Measurements, U.S.A. The dry layer had a thickness of about 30 um. The butyl rubber film was tooled fromM coat F butyl rubber sheet material from the same manufacturer and being rolled to a thickness of 0.8 mm. The surface finish of the aluminum body in the finished area off the actual location of the stain gauge amounted in the example to a roughness of about 20 Ru. Grit blasting the area for conventionally cementing the strain gauge virtually doubled the roughness.
