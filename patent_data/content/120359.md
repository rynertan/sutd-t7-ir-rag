## Description
Tetrahydrothiophenone derivative active in respiratory system affections The present invention relates to N 2 thenoyl N 2 keto 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro thiophene 3 yl amine of formula IEMI1.1 to a process for preparing it and to pharmaceutical compositions containing it. This compound, which will be hereinafter namedYS 869 for sake of shortness, is a valuable agent in the treatment of respiratory system affections such as bronchitis, tracheobronchitis, bronchopneu monia, asthma, enphysema and in the symptomatic the rapy of every kind of acute and chronic cough. YS 869 in fact exhibits excellent mucusregulating, bronchosecretogogue and antitussive activities. The compound of the invention has another advanta geous activity, that is a potent antiinflammatory action, comparable to the one of acetylsalicylic acid, and moreover practically no gastrolesivity de gree, by far lower than the one of acetylsalicylic acid. Such an activity, in addition to the above mentioned ones, allows to carry out a complete and ef fective treatment of respiratory system diseases with inflammatory condition The compound of the invention is prepared by reacting homocysteine thiolactone hydrochloride with a 2 thiophenecarboxylic acid reactive deriva tive, such as an acyl chloride or anhydride. The reaction is effected in the presence of acid binding agents, preferably bases such as alkali hydroxides previously added to the homocysteine thiolactone hydrochloride in the form of aqueous solutions. The acylating reaction is preferably carried out at temperatures ranging from 0 to 200 C. As the reactive derivative an acyl chloride, dis solved in aromatic hydrocarbons, is employed the addition of the chloride to the reaction mixture is carried out at temperatures between 0 and 50C.After completion of the reaction, the product may be recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional means. This compound may be further purified by such conventional techniques as column chromatography or recrystallization. The preparation of the compound of the invention is further illustrated by the following nonlimiting example.EXAMPLE 16.8 G of homocysteine thiolactone hydrochloride and 4.35 g of NaOH were dissolved in 150 ml of water, with stirring. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 0 C and 18 g of the acyl chloride of 2 thiophene carboxylic acid dissolved in 15 ml of benzene was added.The resulting mixture was stirred for 1 hour below 200C, then the reaction mixture was diluted with 50 ml of petroleum ether. The resulting residue was filtered, dissolved in dichloromethane and washed with a hydrogenocarbonate solution. 9 G of pure product was obtained, showing single spot in TLC. The product was recrystallized from 1 1 dichloromethan diethyl ether mixture.M.p. 127 1290C. The compound is soluble in common organic solvents.Elemental analysis for C9H9NO2S2 M.W. 227.29 Calculated C 47.55 H 3.99 N 6.15Found C 47.5 H 3.92 N 6.10.

Experimental Studies on the expectorant action of several drugs Kagoshima Daiga ken Igaken Zasshi. 27, 561, 1976 , in comparison with known drugs. This method consists in determinating the amount of sodium fluoride eliminated with the fluid in the respiratory tract. YS 869 at a dosage of 500 mg kg exhibits a bronchosecretogogue activity higher than the one ofAmbroxol and nearly equal to the one of S carboxymethyl cysteine, causing in the treated rats a 50 increase of the NaF elimination in the secretion with respect to the control group see Table I .
