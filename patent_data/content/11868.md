## Description
bETHYLDOPA COMPOSITIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention concerns a liquid suspension containing methyldopa useful for oral treatment of hypertension. Methyldopa L 3 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl 2 methylalanine is a known antihypertensive agent.It is generally administered orally for treating a hyp rtensive patient. The dosage form commonly used is a tablet. In some instances e.g.with children or the very elderly, administration of methyldopa in a palatable, liquid dosage form would be advantageous provided that it had a bioavailability at least equivalent to that of the tablet form. Such a liquid pharmaceutical composition containing methyldopa has been discovered.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A liquid pharmaceutical composition for treating hypertension containing methyldopa and sucrose. EXCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS An embodiment of the present invention is narmaceutical composition for treating hypertension mans comprising an agueous suspension containing ldopa and sucrose. This suspension can contain from about 15 to about 100 mg of methyldopa per milliter ml aqueous suspensi .. It will preferably contain mg. to 100 . of methyldopa, and most reierably about 50 mg. of methyldopa, per ml. of d suspension The suspension must also contain from about mg. to about 24 mg. of sucrose per mg. of hyldopa. preferably, the suspension will contain from about 1 mg. to about 12 mg. of sucrose per mg.methyldopa more preferably the weight ratio of methyldopa sucrose is about 1 2 to about 1 10 and most preferably about 1 10. In addition to the essential in ents methyldopa and sucrose, the composition of the present invention can contain other ingredient entionally used to prepare a pharmaceutically useuTh suspension. Such ingredients include antioxidants, e.g. sodium bisulfite, disodium edetate ana citric acid, thickening suspending agents, e.g xanthan gum and Veegum K, flavorings, preservatives, loring agents and the like. Conventional procedures and equipment are used to prepare the present suspensions. k outstanding characteristic of the esent suspension is that the ioavailability the methyldopa is equal to or greater than ldopa administered in conventional tablet form. When sorbitol, which is very commonly used to prepare pharmaceutically useful suspensions, is substituted for the sucrose in the present suspension, the bioavailability of the methyldopa is substantially less than methyldopa administered as a tabletThis is indeed suprising since sorbitol is reported to enhance the bioavailability of other pharmaceutically active compounds such as vitamins, C E, News, p. 59 60, February 24, 1958 . The bioavailability of methyldopa was determined in vivo by measuring the concentration of methyldopa and conjugated methyldopa in the plasma and urine of humans subjects to whom 500 mg of methyl dopa were administered in standard tablet form and in suspension form. These measurements showed the bioavailability of methyldopa in the various dosage forms to be as follows Suspension containing sucrose or tablet suspension containing sorbitol.Thus, the present suspension dosage form is bioequivalent to methyldopa in conventional tablet form Following are formulations illustrating the compositions of the present invention R A die III III IVM dona US Mille Anhydrous 50.0 mg. 50.0 mg. 10 mg. 100 mg.
