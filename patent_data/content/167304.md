## Description
ADDITION POLYIMIDE COMPOSITION The present invention relates to thermosetting polyimide compositions. Reinforced thermoset plastics are increasingly being used to replace more traditional materials, particularly in the automotive, aerospace and marine industries. The reinforced plastics generally comprise fibres e.g. glass or carbon fibres bonded in a suitable matrix material e.g. a polyester or epoxy resin. Bis maleimide resins are known and it is also known to use such resins as a matrix material in reinforced plastic compositions.However, cured polyimide resins have a relatively high crosslink density and so they have a relatively low impact resistance. It has now been found that the impact resistance of thermoset polyimides can be increased by the addition of a vinyl ester to the composition before curing. The addition of the vinyl ester to the polyimide may also reduce the amount of water absorbed by the cured composition and the rate of water absorption. Thus according to the present invention a curable thermosetting polyimide composition comprises a major proportion of a polyimide prepolymer and a minor proportion of a vinyl ester. The present invention includes a process for producing a cured thermoset polyimide composition, a cured thermoset polyimide composition, and a prepreg composition comprising the thermosetting polyimide composition according to the present invention. The polyimide prepolymers suitable for use in the present invention include all unsaturated polyimides such as bis imides, tris imides, tetrrimides etc. A number of bisvimites, such as, for example, bis maleimides, and at least one tris maleimide are commercially available Tris imides provide a higher crosslink density. Particularly suitable for use in the present invention are the N, N bis imides having the following general formula EMI2.1 where R1 is a divalent radical containing at least one carbon atom and R2 is a divalent radical containing a carbon carbon double bond. The divalent radical R1 preferably has not more than 20 carbon atoms. R1 may be, for example, a linear or branched alkylene group having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms, a cycloalkylene group having 5 or 6 carbon atoms, a heterocyclic group with 4 or 5 carbon atoms and at least one nitrogen, sulphur or oxygen atom in the heterocyclic ring or a mono or dicarbocyclic group. These groups may have substituents which do not give undesirable side reactions. R1 may also be two or more dicarbocyclic aromatic or cycloalkylene groups which are connected directly or by a divalent atom or group such as, for example, oxygen, sulphur, an alkylene group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms or one of the following groups EMI2.2 EMI3.1 where R3, R4, Rs and R6 are alkyl groups having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. The divalent radical R2 in the above bis imide formula may be derived from acids or anhydrides such as, for example, maleic acid citraconic acid, tetrahydronaphthalic acid and nadic methyl anhydride. Preferably, K2 is a group having one of the following structural formulae EMI3.2 Suitable bis imides include di 4 maleimidophenyl methane 2,4 bismaleimido toluene 1,6 bismaleimido 2,2,4 trimethylhexane N,N L hexamethylene dimaleimide N,Np phenylene dimaleimide 1,2 bismaleimido ethaneN,N1 4,41 diphenyl ether bismaleimideN,NÚ 4,4Ú diphenyl sulphone bismaleimide N,N L4,4 Ldiphenyl cyclohexane bismaleimide 1,6 bismaleimido hexane 1,12 bismaleimido dodecane 1,3 bismaleimido benzene 1,4 bismaleimido benzene 4,4Ú bismaleimido diphenyl sulphide 4,41 bismaleimido dicyclohexyl methane 2,6 bismaleimido toluene N ,NLxylylene bismaleimide N,Ntp xylylene bismaleimide N,Nt,phenylene bis citraconomide N,N1 4,41 diphenyl methane bis itaconimide A mixture of bismaleimides may be used. British Patent No. 1190718 discloses cross linked resins obtained by reacting bis imides and a diamine of the formula H2NX NH2 where X is a divalent organic radical of not more than 30 carbon atoms. The curable compositions according to the present invention may also contain a diamine having the same general formula. Suitable diamines are disclosed in GB 1190718 and include, for example, bis 4 aminophenyl methane, bis 4 aminophenyl ether and 1,1 bis 4 aminophenyl cyclohexane. Preferably the molar ratio of bis imide to diamine is from 1 2 to 50 1 and is more preferably from 1.3 1 to 5 1. Preferably the bis imide is reacted with the diamine prior to the addition of the vinyl ester. US Patent No. 4211861 discloses a thermosetting imide resin obtained by reacting a bis imide with at least one hydrazide of an amino acid having the general formula EMI4.1 in which Y is a divalent organic group. The curable compositions according to the present invention may also contain at least one hydrazide having the above general formula. Suitable hydrazides are disclosed in US 4211861 and include, for example, m amino benzoic acid hydrazide, p amino benzoic acid hydrazide, amino caproic acid hydrazide, amino butyric acid hydrazide, amino acetic acid hydrazide and amino valeric acid hydrazide. The molar ratio of the bis imide to amino acid hydrazide is preferably 1.1 1 to 10 1.The bis imide and the amino acid hydrazide may be reacted together at a temperature of from 800C to 1800C for a predetermined time to produce a product which can still be moulded. The vinyl ester resin composition may then be added to this reaction product to form a curable composition according to the present invention. Alternatively the three components may simply be mixed together to form A curable composition. Vinyl ester resins suitable for use in the present invention are known and some are commercially available. They may be prepared, according to known techniques, by reacting an ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid with an epoxy resin generally in the presence of a catalyst such as, for example a tertiary amine, a phosphine or an alkali or onium salt. The ester has terminal vinyl groups. Suitable unsaturated monocarboxylic acids include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, cinnamic acid and crotonic acid. Epoxy resins, i.e. substances containing on average more than one 1,2 epoxide group per molecule are known. For example, an extensive list of commercially available epoxy resins is given in Handbook of Epoxy Resins by Lee and Neville, McGraw Hill Inc 1967 . Epoxy resins suitable for use in the present invention include diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A and homologues thereof, epoxylated phenol formaldehyde novolak resins, propylene oxide diepoxide and glycidyl amine epoxies such as tri glycidyl amino phenol and tetraglycidyl methylene dianiline. Suitable vinyl ester resins include those having the following general formulae EMI5.1 where n is from 1 to 3 EMI6.1 where R in each of the above formulae is H or CH3. Preferably the amount of vinyl ester used in the composition is from 5 to 90, more preferably 10 to 50 and most preferably 25 to 50 parts per hundred parts of the polyimide prepolymer. The compositions according to the present invention may also contain other components which are known for use in vinyl ester or polyimide compositions such as, for example, curing or hardening agents, fillers, pigments, extenders and flexibilisers. For example, the compositions according to the present invention may contain triallyl isocyanurate which tends to increase the heat distortion temperature of the cured material and lower the melting point of the composition before curing. Divinyl benzene or diallyl phthalate may also lower the melting point of the composition before curing and divinyl benzene may also lower the curing temperature.The composition according to the invention may also contain one or more elastomer which is compatible with the polyimide and vinyl ester. The amount of curing agent which may be included in the compositions according to the present invention is typically from 0.05 to 2.5 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of the total resin composition. The amount of elastomers which may be included is typically from 1 to 20 parts by weight and the other additives from 1 to 30 parts by weight. The polyimide composition according to the present invention may be prepared by mixing together the polyimide prepolymer and vinyl ester at an elevated temperature which is above the melting point of both the polyimide resin and the vinyl ester but below the curing temperature of the polyimide prepolymer. Typically, the components are blended together at a temperature in the range 80 to 1200C. Additives may generally be added to either the molten polyimide prepolymer or vinyl ester. A curing agent, if present, is preferably added to the blend of vinyl ester and polyimide prepolymer. If a solid elastomer is to be included, it is preferably added dissolved in a suitable solvent such as, for example, methylene chloride or acetone, and the temperature of the blend maintained at a sufficiently high temperature to remove the solvent. The compositions may be cured using conventional techniques.The temperature and time used for curing the compositions will depend on the components used and their relative proportions.Typically, a composition based on a bis imide such as a bis maleimide may be cured by heating at a temperature in the range 120 to 2000C for a period of from 2 to 20 hours. The compositions may be post cured e.g. by heating at a temperature of from 200 to 2500C for a period of from 4 to 24 hours. The polyimide compositions according to the present invention are particularly suitable for use as a matrix material for fibre reinforced compositions. Suitable fibres for use in such compositions include glass fibres, carbon fibres, boron fibres, silicon carbide fibres and organic synthetic fibres such as aramides. Prepreg material may be prepared by using known techniques to coat woven or non woven webs, filaments or rovings with a polyimide composition according to the present invention. The polyimide composition may be applied to the fibres in the form of a solution but is preferably applied as a hot melt. Typically, the prepreg comprises 20 to 50X by weight of the polyimide composition, preferably 25 to 40X by weight. A prepreg material according to the present invention may be used and cured using conventional techniques and apparatus. For example, the prepreg material may be laid up in a suitable mould and then heated in an autoclave or pressclave at elevated temperature and pressure.Typically, the pressure used will be from 50 to 300 psi and the mould is heated at the rate of 1 to SOC per minute to a temperature in the range 170 to 2100C and maintained at that temperature for 1 to 5 hours. The article may then be post cured at a higher temperature e.g. 210 to 250 C for a period of from 4 to 24 hours. The invention is illustrated by the following examples. Example 1 Four curable resin compositions, according to the present invention, were prepared by blending different amounts of a vinyl ester with a molten mixture of bismaleimides. The bismaleimide mixture used was a commercially available resin sold by Technochemie under the trade name Compimide 353 and comprised a mixture of three bismaleimides viz.di 4 maleimidophenyl methane, 2,4 bismaleimido toluene and 1,6 bismaleimido 2,2, 4 trimethylhexane. COMPIMIDE is a trade mark. The mixture comprised approximately 85 by weight of the aromatic bismaleimides and 15 by weight of the aliphatic bismaleimide. The resin was a eutectic mixture with an overall melting point of 70 1250C. The vinyl ester used was a commercially available bisphenol A vinyl ester having the following general formula EMI9.1 where n 1 or 2 The proportion of the vinyl ester to the mixture of bismaleimides for each of the four compositions according to the present invention is given in Table 1. The blends of vinyl ester and bismaleimides were de gassed in order to ensure void free castings and then poured into moulds which had been preheated to a temperature of 170 C. The compositions were cured at 1700C for one hour, followed by heating at 2100C for 16 hours. Samples of the cured compositions were subjected to the standard test method ASTM D790 71 Test for Flexural Properties ofPlastics in order to determine the flexural moduli and strengths of the compositions at 220C, 1300C and 2000C. The Charpy ImpactResistance of samples of the cured compositions was determined by the standard test method BS 2782 Part 3, Method 351A 1977 . The results are given in Table 1. For comparison, the flexural moduli and strengths and CharpyImpact Resistance of the mixture of bismaleimides cured in the same way but in the absence of vinyl ester were also measured and the results are also given in Table 1. The results in Table 1 show that the inclusion of vinyl ester improves the toughness of the polyimide mixture as indicated by the increase in Charpy Impact Resistance. Samples of Composition D and the Comparative Composition were placed in water maintained at 7O0C for 336 hours. At the end of this period, the Comparative Composition was found to have absorbed 5.5Z by weight of water whereas Composition D had absorbed only 3.1 by weight.Example 2 A curable composition according to the present invention was prepared by blending 50 parts by weight of the same vinyl ester as used in Example 1 with 100 parts by weight of the same commercially available bismaleimide mixture as used in Example 1. To this blend was added 0.25Z by weight based on the total weight of the blend of diazobicyclo octane, as a curing agent. The composition was then used to prepare a prepreg material comprising unidirectional fibres. The prepreg was prepared by the known solvent technique using commercially available carbon fibres and a 60Z by weight solution of the resin composition in acetone. The prepreg material was moulded using a matched mould technique and then samples of the material were subjected to the test method ASTM D790 71 to determine the flexural strength and modulus, at 220C and 200 C, of the cured, reinforced composition, in the direction of the fibres. The interlaminar shear strength of the cured, reinforced composition was also determined at 220C and 2000C using the standard test methodASTM D2733 70. The results which are given in Table 2 show that the composition retained more than 60X of its interlaminer shear strength and flexural strength and more than 95X of its flexural modulus at the higher temperature.

The Charpy Impact Resistance of the cured composition according to the invention was 9.02 KJm2 whereas theCharpy Impact Resistance of the bismaleimide resin in the absence of the vinyl ester was only 4.49 KJm 2. Example 4 Example 3 was repeated except that the bismaleimide resin used was a commercially available resin sold by Technochemie under the trade name Compimide 800. This resin comprises the same bismaleimide prepolymer as the Compimide 795 used in Example 3 but also comprises approximately 4X by weight of an elastomer and 6X by weight of diallyl phthalate. A further 8 parts by weight of diallylphthalate and 0.25 parts of DABCO were also added to and mixed with the blend of bismaleimide and vinyl ester. The composition was moulded and cured in the same manner as described inExample 1.The Charpy Impact Resistance of the cured composition according to the present invention was 11.9 KJm 2 whereas the CharpyImpact Resistance of the composition in the absence of the vinyl ester was only 5.2 KJm 2. The amount of water absorbed by a sample of the cured composition according to the present invention after immersion in water at 700C for 336 hours was 3.0Z by weight. In comparison, the composition in the absence of the vinyl ester absorbed 5.4X by weight.Example 5 Fibre reinforced samples were prepared by reinforcing the composition according to Example 4 with fibres. Samples of aComparative Composition which was the same as the composition ofExample 4 except that it contained no vinyl ester were also reinforced in the same manner. The fibre reinforced samples were prepared by prepregging commercially available carbon fibres by the known hot melt technique and moulding the samples by compression moulding. The samples were cured by heating to 1400C at a heating rate of 30C min, applying a pressure of 60 psi, continuing the heating at the same rate up to 1900C and maintaining this temperature for 3 hours. The samples were cooled under pressure to ambient temperature about 220C and then removed from the moulds and post cured at 2400C for 16 hours. The fracture toughness of the cured, reinforced compositions was determined by the double cantilever beam method described in Boeing Aircraft Corporation Specification B 7080 00 480 Area Method and also in J. ReinforcedPlastics and Composites 1982 Vol. 1, page 297, J. Whity et al. The fracture toughness of the composition according to the invention was 350 Jm 2 whereas the fracture toughness of theComparative Composition which contained no vinyl ester was only 260 Jam 2.
