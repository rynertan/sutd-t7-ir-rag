# A method of liquid phase epitaxial growth.

## Abstract
In liquid phase epitaxial growth of a compound semicon ductor layer on a substrate 6 , an unsaturated solution 8 is brought into contact with a solute source crystalline plate 7 . The plate 7 dissolves into the solution 8 . The solution 8 is then brought into contact with the substrate 6 . The crystalline plate 7 has a denser crystal face than that of the substrate 6 , and or the lattice constant of the crystalline plate 7 is different from that of the substrate 6 and hence a quasi supercooled condition in the solution is created with out decrease of the solution temperature so that a compound semiconductor layer is deposited on the substrate 6 .
