# Method for recording and reproducing electron beam image information.

## Abstract
A method for recording and reproducing an electron beam image information comprising recording an electron beam image transmitted through reflected from the sample as an electron beam energy la tent image on a stimulable phosphor sheet comprising a sti mulable phosphor layer having a thickness in the range of 10 to 150 Âµm or an exposed stimulable phosphor layer with no protective layer irradiating said stimulable phosphor sheet with an elec tromagnetic wave to release at least a portion of electron beam energy stored in said stimulable phosphor sheet as stimulated emission detecting the stimulated emission, and photoelectrically processing the detected stimulated emission to obtain an electron beam image information of the sample.
