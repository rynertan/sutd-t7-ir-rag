# Light emitting diodes with high external quantum efficiency.

## Abstract
A surface emitting light emitting diode LED has a reflect ing element 24 22 to redirect light emitted away from the light emitting region towards an exit window 30 . The LED bot tom contact 24 is formed over the reflecting element 24 22 and a current confining path is set up within the LED to funnell current between the top and bottom contacts 24 28 around the reflecting 24 22 element and through the light emitting region 32 .
