## Description
NOVEL ORON CONTAINING CO B OSITIONS USEFUL AS LUBRICANT ADDITIVES This invention concerns compositions reaction products which can be used as additives for lubricants, a nethod for their preparation, and additive concentrates and lubricants containing them. In its broadest sense, the invention includes oil soluble boron containing compositions prepared by reacting, at a temperature from about 800 to about 2 5O0C., A at least one of boric acid and boron trioxide with B at least one epoxide having the formula.EMI1.1 wherein each of R1, R2, R3 and R4 is hydrogen or an aliphatic radical or any two thereof together form a cyclic radical, said epoxide containing at least 8 carbon atoms. The increasing sophistication of internal combustion engines necessitates the development of new types of lubricants for use in them. The new engines in many instances operate under far more severe conditions than was formerly the case, and the lubricants must be tailored so as to permit them to be used over prolonged periods of time under those severe condi tions. As an example of the diverse types of requirements for lubricants, consideration should be given to diesel engines in heavy machinery. The lubricant performance requirements in such engines are much different from those in gasoline engines for automobiles. Nevertheless, it is frequently advantageous to formulate a single multi purpose lubricant for use in both types of engines. The severity of the conditions in diesel hear machinery engines requires the presence in the lubricant of relatively high levels of ashless dispersants and or ash producing detergents. For example, many such lubricants contain basic alkaline earth metal phenates in amounts of 2.5 by weight or higher, and or free hydroxy group containing alkenylsuccinic acid ester dispersants in amounts of 1.5 or higher. The use of such lubricants in ordinary gasoline engines frequently causes a high degree of wear on engine parts. Conventional anti wear agents such as zinc dialkylphosphorodithioates are, in many instances, not entirely effective in eliminating this problem. Ways were therefore sought of providing anti wear additives effective in lubricants used under a wide variety of operating conditions. Preferred features of the invention will now be described in more detail. As will be apparent, the compositions of this invention are characterized by the method for their preparation which involves the reaction of two materials. Reagent A may be boron trioxide or any of the various forms of boric acid, including metaboric acid HBO2 , orthoboric acid E3BO3 and tetraboric acid H2B407 . Boric acid, and especially orthoboric acid, is preferred. Reagent B is at least one epoxide having the above formula and containing at least 8 carbon atoms.In the formula, each of the R values is most often hydrogen or an aliphatic radical with at least one being an aliphatic radical containing at least 6 carbon atoms. The term aliphatic radical includes aliphatic hydrocarbon radicals e.g., hexyl, heptyl, octyl, decyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, stearyl, hexenyl, oleyl , preferably free from acetylenic unsaturation substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon radicals including substituents such as hydroxy, nitro, carbalkoxy, alkoxy and alkylthi o especially those containing a lower alkyl radical i.e., one containing 7 carbon atoms or less and hetero atom containing radicals in which the hetero atoms may be, for example, oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur The aliphatic radicals are preferably alkyl radicals, and more preferably those containing from about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms.It is within the scope of the invention to use commercial mixtures of epoxides for example, commercial mixtures of Cz 6 or Cz4 1e epoxides and the like, wherein R1 is a mixture of alkyl radicals having two less carbon atoms than the epoxide.Most desirably, R1 is a straight chain alkyl radical and especially the tetradecyl radical. Also within the scope of the invention is the use of epoxides in which any two of the R radicals form a cyclic radical, which may be alicyclic or hetero cyclic. Examples are n butylcyclopentene oxide, nhexylcyclohexene oxide, methylenecyclooctene oxide and 2 methylene 3 n hexyltetrahydrofuran oxide. The boron containing compositions of this invention may be prepared by merely blending the two reagents and heating them at a temperature from about 800 to about 2500C., preferably from about 1000 to about 2000C., for a period of time sufficient for reaction to take place. If desired, the reaction may be effected in the presence of a substantially inert, normally liquid organic diluent such as toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, dimethylforamide or the like, but the use of such diluents is usually unnecessary.During the reaction, water is frequently evolved and may be removed by distillation. In a preferred method for preparing the boron containing compositions, which minimizes foaming and exothermic reactions which generate more heat than is desirable, reagent A is initially blended with a heel of product. The blend is heated to the desired reaction temperature, typically between about 1500 and about 2000C., and reagent B is added gradually as water of reaction is removed. The molar ratio of reagent A to reagent B is generally between about 1 0.25 and about 1 4. Ratios between about 1 1 and about 1 3 are preferred, with 1 2 being an especially preferred ratio. It is frequently advantageous to employ a catalytic amount of an alkaline reagent to facilitate the reaction. Suitable alkaline reagents include inorganic bases and basic salts such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and sodium carbonate metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide, potassium t butoxide and calcium ethoxide heterocyclic amines such as piperidine, morpholine and pyridine and aliphatic amines such as n butylamine, di n hexylamine and tri nbutylamine. The preferred alkaline reagents are the aliphatic and heterocyclic amines and especially tertiary amines. When the preferred method involving the heel is used, the alkaline reagent is typically added to the blend of the heel with reagent A. The molecular structures of the composL tions of this invention are not known with certainty.During their preparation water is evolved in nearstoichiometric amounts for conversion of boric acid to boron trioxide when reagent A is boric acid, and gel permeation chromatography of the composition pre pared from boric acid and a C16 a olefin oxide mixture in a 1 2 molar ratio indicates the presence in substantial amounts of three constituents having approximate molecular weights of 400, 600 and 1200. From these facts, it appears that the. composition comprises principally borated condensation products of polymers of the epoxide with a minor proportion of compounds of one or both of the formulasEMI5.1 wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are as previously defined. The preparation of the compositions of this invention is illustrated by the following examples.

Heating is continued until removal of volatiles is complete.The residue is then vacuum stripped and filtered. The filtrate is the desired product it contains 3.9 boron. As previously indicated, the boron contain ing compositions of this invention are useful as additives for lubricants. They are particularly effective in reducing wear which may result from the use in heavyduty or multi purpose lubricants of high levels of ashless or ash producing dispersants and detergents. They are also effective as friction modifiers and rust inhibitors. The compositions of this invention can be employed in a variety of lubricants based on diverse oils of lubricating viscosity, including natural and synthetic lubricating oils and mixtures thereof. These lubricants include crankcase lubricating oils for sparkignited and compression ignited internal combustion engines, including automobile and truck engines, twocycle engines, aviation piston engines, marine and railroad diesel engines, and the like. They can also be used in gas engines, stationary power engines and turbines and the like. Automatic transmission fluids, transaxle lubricants, gear lubricants, metal working lubricants, hydraulic fluids and other lubricating oil and grease compositions may also benefit from the incorporation therein of the compositions of the present invention. Natural oils include liquid petroleum oils and solvent treated or acid treated mineral lubricating oils of the paraffinic, naphthenic and mixed paraffinicnaphthenic types. Oils of lubricating viscosity derived from coal or shale are also useful base oils. Synthetic lubricating oils include hydrocarbon oils and halosubstituted hydrocarbon oils such as polymerized and interpolymerized olefins e.g., polybutylenes, polypropylenes, propylene isobutylene copolymers, chlorinated polybutylenes, poly l hexenes , poly l octenes , poly l decenes , etc. and mixtures thereof3 alkylbenzenes e.g., dodecylbenzenes, tetradecylbenzenes, dinonylbenzenes, di 2 ethylhexyl ben2enes, etc. polyphenyls e.g., biphenyls, terphenyls, alkylated polyphenyls, etc. , alkylated diphenyl ethers and alkylated diphenyl sulfides and the derivatives, analogs and homologs thereof and the like. Alkylene oxide polymers and interpolymers and derivatives thereof where the terminal hydroxyl groups have been modified by esterification, etherification, etc. constitute another class of known synthetic lubricating oils. These are exemplified by the oils prepared through polymerization of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide, the alkyl and aryl ethers of these polyoxyalkylene polymers e.g., methyl polyisopropylene glycol ether having an average molecular weight of 1000, diphenyl ether of polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of 500 1000, diethyl ether of polypropylene glycol having a molecular weight of 1000 1500, etc. or mono and polycarboxylic esters thereof, for example, the acetic acid esters, mixed C3 Ce fatty acid esters, or the C1 3 Oxo acid diester of tetraethylene glycol. Another suitable class of synthetic lubricating oils comprises the esters of dicarboxylic acids e.g., phthalic acid, succinic acid, alkyl succinic acids and alkenyl succinic acids, maleic acid, azelaic acid, suberic acid, sebacic acid, fumaric acid, adipic acid, linoleic acid dimer, malonic acid, alkyl malonic acids, alkenyl malonic acids, etc. with a variety of alcohols e.g., butyl alcohol, hexyl alcohol, dodecyl alcohol, 2 ethylhexyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monoether, propylene glycol, etc. .Specific examples of these esters include dibutyl adipate, di 2 ethylhexyl sebacate, di n hexyl fumarate, dioctyl sebacate, diisooctyl azelate, diisodecyl azelate, dioctyl phthalate, didecyl phthalate, dieicosyl sebacate, the 2 ethylhexyl diester of linoleic acid dimer, the complex ester formed by reacting one mole of sebacic acid with two moles of tetraethylene glycol and two moles of 2 ethylhexanoic acid, and the like. Esters useful as synthetic oils also include those made from C5 to C12 monocarboxylic acids and polyols and polyol ethers such as neopentyl glycol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, tripentaerythritol, etc. Silicon based oils such as the polyalkyl , polyaryl , polyalkoxy , or polyaryloxy siloxane oils and silicate oils comprise another useful class of synthetic lubricatns e.g., tetraethyl silicate, tetrÅaisopropyl silicate, tetra 2 ethylhexyl silicate, tetra 4 methyl 2 ethylhexyl silicate, tetra p tert butylphenyl silicate, hexa 4 methyl 2 pentoxy disiloxane, poly methyl siloxanes, poly methylphenyl siloxanes, etc. .Other synthetic lubricating oils include liquid esters of phosphorus containing acids e.g., tricresyl phosphate, trioctyl phosphate, diethyl ester of decylphosphonic acid, etc. , polymeric tetrahydrofurans and the like. Unrefined, refined and rerefined oils and mixtures thereof of the type disclosed hereinabove can be used in the lubricant compositions of the present invention. Unrefined oils are those obtained directly from a natural or synthetic source without further purification treatment. For example, a shale oil obtained directly from retorting operations, a petroleum oil obtained directly from distillation or ester oil obtained directly from an esterification process and used without further treatment would be an unrefined oil. Refined oils are similar to the unrefined oils except they have been further treated in one or more purification steps to improve one or more properties. Many such purification techniques are known to those of skill in the art such as solvent extraction, acid or base extraction, filtration, percolation, etc.Rerefined oils are obtained by processes similar to those used to obtain refined oils applied to refined oils which have been already used in service. Such rerefined oils are also known as reclaimed or reprocessed oils and often are additionally processed by techniques directed to removal of spent additives and oil breakdown products. Generally, the lubricants of the present invention contain an amount of the composition of this invention sufficient to provide it with anti wear, friction modifying and or rust inhibiting properties.Normally this amount will be about 0.01 to about 10 , preferably about 0.1 to about 5 , of the total weight of the lubricant. The invention also contemplates the use of other additives in combination with the boron containing compositions. Such additives include, for example, detergents and dispersants of the ash producing or ashless type, corrosion and oxidation inhibiting agents, pour point depressing agents, extreme pressure agents, color stabilizers and anti foam agents. The ash producing detergents are exemplified by oil soluble neutral and basic salts of alkali or alkaline earth metals with sulfonic acids, carboxylic acids, or organic phosphorus acids characterized by at least one direct carbon to phosphorus linkage such as those prepared by the treatment of an olefin polymer e.g., polyisobutene having a molecular weight of 1000 with a phosphorizing agent such as phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus heptasulfide, phosphorus pentasulfide, phosphorus trichloride and sulfur, white phosphorus and a sulfur halide, or phosphorothioic chloride. The most commonly used salts of such acids are those of sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium, strontium and barium. The term basic salt is used to designate metal salts wherein the metal is present in stoichiometrically larger amounts than the organic acid radical.The commonly employed methods for preparing the basic salts involve heating a mineral oil solution of an acid with a stoichiometric excess of a metal neutralizing agent such as the metal oxide, hydroxide, carbonate, bicarbonate, or sulfide at a temperature above 50at. and filtering the resulting mass. The use of a promoter in the neutralization step to aid the incorporation of a large excess of metal likewise is known. Examples of compounds useful as the promoter include phenolic substances such as phenol, naphthol, alkylphenol, thiophenol, sulfurized alkylphenol, and condensation products of formaldehyde with a phenolic substance alcohols such as methanol, 2 propanol, octyl alcohol, cellosolve, carbitol, ethylene glycol, stearyl alcohol, and cyclohexyl alcohol and amines such as aniline, phenylenediamine, phenothiazine, phenyl ss naphthylamine, and dodecylamine.A particularly effective method for preparing the basic salts comprises mixing an acid with an excess of a basic alkaline earth metal neutralizing agent and at least one alcohol promoter, and carbonating the mixture at an elevated temperature such as 60 2000C. Ashless detergents and dispersants are so called despite the fact that, depending on its constitution, the dispersant may upon combustion yield a nonvolatile material such as boric oxide or phosphorus pentoxide however, it does not ordinarily contain metal and therefore does not yield a metal containing ash on combustion. Many types are known in the art, and any of them are suitable for use in the lubricants of this invention. The following are illustrative 1 Reaction products of carboxylic a 8 or derivatives thereof containing at least about 34 and preferably at least about 54 carbon atoms with nitrogen containlng compounds such as amine, organic hydroxy compounds such as phenols and alcohols, and or basic inorganic materials.Examples of these car boxylic dispersants are described in British Patent 1,306,529 and in many U.S. patents including the following 3,163,603 3,351,552 3,541,012 3,184,474 3,381,022 3,542,678 3,215,707 3,399,141 3,542,680 3,219,666 3,415,750 3,567,637 3,271,310 3,433,744 3,574,101 3,272,746 3,444,170 3,576,743 3,281,357 3,448,048 3,630,904 3,306,908 3,448,049 3,632,510 3,311,558 3,451,933 3,632,511 3,316,177 3,454,607 3,697,428 3,30,281 3,467,668 3,725,441 3,341,542 3,501,405 4,234,435 3,346,493 3,522,179 Re 26,433 2 Reaction products of relatively high molecular weight aliphatic or alicyclic halides with amines, preferably polyalkylene polyamines.
