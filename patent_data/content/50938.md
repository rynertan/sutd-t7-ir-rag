# A deaerator assembly.

## Abstract
A deaerator assembly for a flow of liquid including a plurality of downward sloping cone shaped dispersion mem bers 12a 12d stacked on top of each other and in spaced relationship to each other. The assembly is characterized by the dispersion members 12a 12d including openings 16 therethrough for distributing a flow of liquid between each of the dispersion members so that the flow of liquid is divided into respective flows over the respective dispersion mem bers. Dams 18,20 are disposed on the upper surface of the dispersion members above and below the openings therein for damming the flow of liquid, whereby the overflowing liquid is spread to completely cover the upper surface of the dispersion member below the dam. The dispersion members further include serrated edges 24 for increasing the edge surface length of each of the dispersion members.
