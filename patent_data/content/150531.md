## Description
FABRIC SOFTENING COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING CLAYS Maria J. WITJENS Francesco de BUZZACCARINI Neil A. MACGILP This invention relates to fabric treatment compositions comprising cationic fabric softeners and clays having a low ion exchange capacity. In more detail, this invention relates to the utilization of conventional fabric softeners in combination with clays having a low ion exchange capacity and a specific surface area to provide textile treatment benefits not achievable from conventional fabric softener technologies containing cationic surface actives, if desired, in combination with detergent clays. The term detergent in this context refers to clays such as montmorillonites which are known to provide through the wash fabric benefits inclusive of softening.The technology herein can be embodied in various physical forms inclusive of liquid, paste and solid, and if desired, substrate like compositions.The technology was found to be particularly beneficial for use in concentrated or conventional liquid rinse softeners. The claimed compositions are capable of delivering enhanced softening performance as compared to what can be obtained from known fabric softener compositions. Another significant benefit originates from the dry, non greasy, feel conferred by the claimed compositions as compared to a greasy lubricated feel of textiles treated with conventional rinse softeners. The clay compound can also provide desirable carrier properties for components which otherwise could not be effectively brought to the fiber to provide benefits e.g. aesthetics which are permanent in between successive laundry treatments. Background of the Invention The use of clays in textile treatment, particularly cleaning compositions, is well known and has found commercial application. The use of water insoluble detergent additives, inclusive of clays, can, based on the mechanism by which these additives exhibit their textile treatment functionality, abitrarily be categorized in two distinct classes, namely those which derive intrinsic softness benefits from compression or slipping of clay platelets lubricated by the water in the inter layers having an ion exchange capacity above 50 meq 100 g., and composite textile benefits derived from spherical particles which do not exhibit ion exchange properties and which act by virtue of a quasi roller bearing effect. The clay platelet prior art is represented by a large number of publications, some examples of which are referred to below. The use of colloidal bentonites in synthetic detergent compositions, built or unbuilt, intended for the washing of hair, textiles, or hard surfaces, is known fromBritish Patent nO 401,413, to Marriott. British Patent nO 1.400.898, to The Procter GambleCompany, also discloses the use of smectite type clays in granular, built, laundry detergent compositions to provide through the wash fabric softening and or anti static benefits. Comparable technology is also known from U.S. Patent n0 3.033.699, to du Pont de Nemours and Co. it pertains to compositions and processes for improving antistatic properties of synthetic fibers with the aid of an aqueous suspension of a magnesium montmorillonite and colloidal silica. U.S. Patent nO 3.886.075, to The Procter GambleCompany, discloses the detergent utilization of particular smectite clays and cationic antistatic agents, in combination with amino compatibilizing agents, thus providing cleaning and other desirable benefits, inclusive of softening. Comparable disclosures are also known from EuropeanPatent Application n08020078.9, to the Procter GambleCompany U.S. Patent nO 4.292.035, to The Procter GambleCompany and U.S. Patent nO 3.594.212, to General Mills,Inc.. The above clay platelet state of the art is exemplified in the use of montmorillonites, smectites and comparable clays having significant ion exchange capacities, as referred to above. The water insoluble additive art relative to particles having no ion exchange capacity is represented by U.S. Patent nO 3.861.870, to The Procter Gamble Company it discloses a fabric softening composition containing a cation active softening agent and substantially water insoluble particulate materials which are free from exchangeable calcium and magnesium ions. The fiber benefits are derived from the geometry and can be visualized as a quasi roller bearing effect. The spherical geometry of the water insoluble materials is defined with the aid of an anisotropy of from 5 1 to 1 1. The clay detergent prior art is silent and non suggestive concerning the utilisation of clays in rinse softener compositions and further is, at least implicitly, possessed of the principle that low ion exchange capacity clays such as kaolins would not deliver textile benefits comparable to e.g.detergent smectites. It was now discovered that kaolin type clays can deliver remarkable textile treatment benefits upon incorporation into rinse softener compositions containing cationic surface active agent. The benefits and the parameter limitations of the claimed technology are explained in more detail hereinafter. Summary of the Invention The present invention provides fabric treatment compositions which are capable of imparting desirable benefits to fabrics treated therewith. Such compositions usually contain a from 50 to 99,5 by weight of a cationic fabric softener and b from 0.5t to 50 by weight of a clay having an ion exchange capacity from 2 to 35 meg lOOg and a specific surface area from 2 to 100 m2 g, preferably 4 to 25 m2 g. In a preferred aspect of the invention, liquid fabric rinse softener compositions are contemplated comprising from 2 to 25 by weight of the cationic fabric softener from O.1 to 10 by weight of the clay and from 40 to 98 , preferably from 65 to 98 , b weight of a liquid carrier and conventional additives whereby the weight ratio of the cationic fabric softener to the clay lies in a range from 1 1 to 80 1, preferably from 2 1 to 25 1. While the liquid executions are preferred, it is understood that the technology can equally be applied in combination with granular non liquid treatment compositions as well as with treatment compositions which are deposited onto a water insoluble e.g. sheet like carrier for use in e.g. hot air dryers. Unless indicated to the contrary, the percent indications hereinafter stand for percent by weight . In the following description, the terms fabric softener and textile treatment are used interchangeably. Detailed description of the invention The invention herein relates to fabric treatment technology comprising, in its broadest scope, a binary ingredient combination, namely a cationic textile treatment agent, and a clay having a low and narrowly defined ion exchange capa city and a relatively low specific surface area. These main parameters as well as preferred and optimized executions of the invention are described and illustrated in more detail in what follows.The Cationic Component The cationic textile treatment component can be represented by all cationic surface active agents which are known to be suitable for use in textiletreatment compositions and have found application in this field of technology. Particularly well known in this respect are fabric softener liquid textile treatment compositions for use in the rinsing step of an automatic washing machine operation. The cationic component generally represents from 50 to 99.5 of the binary cationic fabric softener low ion exchange clay mixture. The individual ingredients are preferably employed in a weight ratio of cationic component clay in the range from 1 1 to 80 1. In the preferred liquid fabric treatment compositions herein, the cationic ingredient frequently represents from 2 to 25 whereby the weight ratio of cationic ingredient to clay is identical to the range referred to hereinbefore, namely from 1 1 to 80 1. In one execution of the preferred liquid fabric softener compositions, the cationic fabric softener represents from 4 to 8 whereas in another preferred, and more concentrated, execution, the cationic ingredient represents from 12 to 18 of the liquid textile treatment composition. The weight ratio of cationic fabric softener to low ion exchange clays in the most preferred liquid softening compositions is in the range from 2 1 to 25 1. Suitable cationic ingredients herein are known textiletreatment components. Many of the like ingredients have found commercial application. Generally, the cationic ingredient is a nistrogen containing material such as quaternary ammonium compounds and amines and have one or two straightchain organic groups of at least eight carbon atoms. Prefe rably, they have one or two such groups of from 12 to 22 carbon atoms. Preferred cationic components include the quaternary ammonium softener compounds corresponding to the formula EMI6.1 wherein R is hydrogen or an aliphatic group of from 1 to 22 carbon atoms R1 is an aliphatic group having from 12 to 22 carbon atoms R2 and R3 are each alkyl groups of from 1 to 3 carbon atoms and X is an anion selected from halogen, acetate, phosphate, nitrate and methyl sulfate radicals. Cation active amines, namely primary, secondary and tertiary amines having, at least, one straight chain organic group of from 12 to 22 carbonatoms can also be used. A well known example of diamines useful herein is tallow N,N , N tris 2 hydroxyethyl 1, 3 propylenediamine. This diamine will be protonated depending upon the pH and qualifies as a cationic in the meaning of the claimed technology. Preferred amines of this class are ethoxyamines, such as monotallow dipolyethoxyamine, having a total of 2 to 30 ethoxygroups per molecule. A useful species of this class is C 18 alkyl N bis 2 hydroxyethyl amines. Other suitable cationic ingredients herein are the quaternary imidazolinium salts. Preferred salts are those conforming to the formula EMI7.1 wherein R6 is an alkyl containing from 1 to 4, preferably from 1 to 2, carbon atoms, R5 is an alkyl containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a hydrogen radical, R8 is an alkyl containing from 1 to 22, preferably at least 15, carbon atoms, R7, an alkyl containing from 8 to 22, preferably at least 15, carbon atoms, and X is an anion, preferably methyl sulfate or chloride ions. Other suitable anions include those disclosed with reference to the cationic quaternary ammonium fabric softeners described hereinbefore.Particularly preferred are those imidazolinium compounds in which both R7 and R8 are alkyls of from 12 to 22 carbon atoms, e.g., l methyl 2 tallow 3 tallowamidoethyl imidazolinium methosulfate. Other cationic quaternary ammonium fabric softeners, which are useful herein include, for example, alkyl C12 toC22 pyridinium chlorides, alkyl C12 to C22 alkyl C1 toC3 morpholinium chlorides, and quaternary derivatives of amino acids and amino esters. The cationic fabric softeners mentioned above can be used singly or in combination in the practice of the present invention.The Clay Component The essential clay component is present in the compositions of the invention at levels from 0.5 to 50 . In the liquid formulation aspect of the invention, the clay is used in an amount from 0.1 to 10 , which amount varies depending upon the level of the cationic textile treatment agent. In one preferred liquid formulation containing from 4 to 8 of the cationic fabric softener, the clay represents from 0.1 to 0.5 , whereas in a more concentrated liquid execution containing from 12 to 18 of said cationic fabric softener, the clay ingredient can represent from 0.5 to 3.5 . Clays generally are essentially alumino silicates which can be crystallized in a variety of mineral structures. They differ in chemical and physical properties, like cation exchange capacity and specific surface area. Clay minerals usually contain besides the alumino silicate hydrous silicates of less abundant metal elements, inclusive of Mg, Fe and others. They are crystallized in layer structures. Their operability for use in the instant compositions is defined via 1 an ion exchange capacity from 2 to 35meq lOO g. and 2 2 a specific surface area from 2 to 100 m g., preferably 4 to 25 m2 g. Clay minerals can carry an excess of negative electric charge owing to internal substitution by lower valent cations.The exchangeable cations are held by weak electrical forces and are more or less easily replaceable by others. No structural change in the mineral is involved as a result of the exchange. The ion exchange is stoichiometric in nature, namely for each cation taken up from the medium, an equivalent amount of ion is released into the medium. The cation exchange capacity is measured in terms of milliequivalents per 100 g, of clay. This is done with the aid of well known techniques, such as electrodialysis exchange wth ammonium ion followed by back titration or the methylene blue procedure. A typical cation exchange reaction may be expressed as follows EMI9.1 The ammonium ion back titration is frequently used and can be carried out in accordance with the operational mode in TheChemistry and Physics of Clays , Interscience, 1971, pages 264 265. The ion exchange capacity of the clays herein is in the range from 2 to 35 meq lOOg. These clays can, in fact, be termed as llow ion exchange clays. It is believed that the relatively low surface charge as compared to e.g. montmorillonite varieties, generates an optimized clay cationic coaction to provide unexpected fiber benefits. The like benefits are not achievable in the event the cationic softener is strongly linked to clays such as e.g. montmorillontes having relatively higher surface charges. The specific surface area is the geometrical surface area per unit of volume, The method usually applied for the determination of this parameter is that proposed by Brunauer,Emmett and Teller, disclosed in Physical and Chemical Aspects of Absorbents and Catalysts , Academic Press, 1970, p 21, 22, 23. It is known as the BET Method the data are generated via the adsorption of nitrogen on solid substances. The particular shape of the clays of the invention leads to a low surface to volume ratio, i.e., a low specific surface area. The clay can, therefore, be more completely surrounded by cations, and possibly spherical particles are formed, which can easily deposit onto the fabric. The clay component herein has a specific surface area from 2 to 100 m2 g., preferably from 4 to 25 m2 g. Clay species particularly suitable for use herein include kaolin, illite clays such as muscovite and mica, talc, and mixtures of these clays. Another useful property of the clays herein is that they can serve as carrier for optional substances that, in the context of prior art fabric softener technology, could not be effectively deposited onto the fabrics from an aqueous rinse in part because these compounds are quite soluble in water. These optional components usually serve to augment and improve known fiber benefits and include, for instance, short chain di or polyfunctional alcohols such as glycerol or ethylene glycol, short chain amines such as triethanolamine, and hydrophilic polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol, polyethyleneimine. Generally these compounds provide good softness properties to cotton fabrics if applied directly to the fabrics by a spray on technique, or by immersing the fabrics in concentrated solutions of said compounds. They could up to now not be effectively deposited onto fabrics under conventional rinse conditions. Clays are known to form complexes with compounds of the type mentioned above, some of these complexes are described, for instance, in TheChemistry of Clay Organic Reactions by B. C.Theng, A.Hilger 1974. In these complexes the organic compounds are believed to be adsorbed between the layers of the clay material. In this way these organic compounds can be deposited together with the clay to the fabrics where the optional component will exhibit the particular benefits. The weight ratio of clay carrier to component deposited thereon is preferably in the range from 1 5 to 6 1, most preferably from 1 2 to 1 1. The clay can also help the fabric deposition of other materials such as perfume, germicidal agents and other optional components for fabric softener compositions which optimals are usually present in sub additive levels e.g. below 2 . The carrier combination inert the clay and the optional component deposited thereon, are prepared separately, i.e., before being incorporated into the claimed compositions, by known means inclusive of mixing the additive and the clay.optional Ingredients The compositions of this invention can contain, in addition to the essential components described in more detail hereinbefore, all kind of matrix ingredients, compatibilizing agents and optional performance additives with a view to facilitate the utilization of the technology by e.g. the housewife, to enhance and facilitate the industrial processing of optimized executions, and also to augment and improve desirable performance benefits. The like additives and optional ingredients are represented by well known ingredients and ingredient mixtures, which are used for their known functionality in the art established levels.Non limiting examples of useful optional ingredients are listed hereinafter. The compositions herein frequently comprise inert matrix ingredients, fillers and or liquid carriers. Matrix ingredients fillers can generally comprise all neutral liquid or solid, frequently inert extenders, such as sodium sulfate, saccharose and possibly mixtures of polyphosphates and sodium sulfate. In the liquid execution herein, the binary active system is stably incorporated and or dispersed and or suspended with the aid of from 40 to 98 , preferably 65 to 98 of a liquid carrier and additives.Suitable liquid carriers comprise water, lower aliphatic alcohols, especially ethanol, isopropanol, n propanol, propanediol, hexanol, hexylene glycol, pentanol, isobutanol, as well as aromatic alcohols, like phenoxyethanol, benzyl alcohol, phenylethylalcohol, C1 18 alkyl phenols ethoxylated with 2 moles of ethylene oxide, and mixtures thereof In order to increase the solubility of the cationic ingredient in the organic solvents, aromatic adjuncts could be added preferred adjuncts of the acid, ester, ketone or phenol types include benzoic acid, m chlorobenzoic acid, p toluic acid, hydrocinnamic acid, salicylic acid, benzyl benzoate, benzyl salicylate, trichlorophenol, benzophenone, benzene sulfonic acid and C 18 alkyl benzene sulfonic acid. In addition to the cationic textile treatment agent, the compositions can also contain nonionic fabric softeners such as those described in German Offenlegungschrift 26 31 114, preferably fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols having up to 8 carbon atoms, Examples of the like esters include sorbitan esters and glycerol esters such as sorbitan monostearate, sorbitanmonooleate, glycerol mono di and trifatty acid esters wherein the acid is selected from stearic, oleic, lauric, capric, caprylic, caproic, valeric, butyric, propionic and acetic acid an individual glycerol can be esterified by identical fatty acid groups or by mixed esters e.g. glycerol monostearatedioleate.Polyethyleneglycol esters of fatty acids such as monooleate, dioleate, monolaurate and monostearate, wherein the polyethyleneglycol moiety has a molecular weight in the range from 200 to 400 are also included in that class. Fatty acid esters of monohydric alcohols having at least 4 carbon atoms such as isobutyl stearate and ethyl hexyl stearate can also be useful. Additional nonionic fabric softeners which can be used are glycerol, diglycerol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, dihexylene glycol, polyethylene glycol MW 200 100.000 , polypropylene glycol MW 200 100.000f, polyvinylalcohol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene copolymers, polypropylene glycol MW 900 , glucose methylether, butyldiglycolether, diethyleneglycolmonobutylether, propyleneglycelmonoethyl or ethyl ether, ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate.

The like nonionic textile treatment agents, can be used in liquid softener compositions in levels which do not exceed the level of cationic textile treatment agent. The liquid compositions herein can also contain viscosity control agents such as calcium chloride and or magnesium chloride at levels of from 100 to 2000 ppm. The compositions may contain silicones such as described in German Patent Application DOS 26 31 419. These materials can provide further benefits inclusive of ease of ironing and anti wrinklIng. The optional silicone component can be used in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 4 , preferably from 0.4 to 3t of the softener composition. Preferred silicones include aminosubstituted silicones, cationic silicones and non substtuted polydimethylsiloxanes. The silicone ingredient is frequently represented by a pre emulsified silicone whereby the emulsifier can be represented by all kind of ionic and nonionic species. Highly ethoxylated fatty acid esters is one known class of suitable emulsifiers. Other optional ingredients for use in the inventive compositions include emulsifiers, perfumes, preservatives, germicides, dyes, bactericides, stabilizers, brighteners, opacifiers, photoactivators, copolymeric carboxylates having sequestering properties, sol release agents, bleaches, bleach activators, and anti yellowIng agents These additives are normally xncoporated at their conventional low levels e.g.from about 0.0at to 5 . Suitable preservatives are frequently used in levels from 0e00lZ to 0.3 and can be represented by 2 nitro 2 bromo propane 1,3 diol, glutaraldehyde, and 2 methyl 4 isothiazolin3 one and its chloro derivative. Photoactivators such as sulfonated Zn phthalocyanine and those disclosed in European Patent Application 79200012.7 can be used in eqg. levels from 10 ppm to 2000 ppm. Copolymeric carboxylates derived from maleic anhydride and methacrylic acid as e.g, disclosed in European PatentApplication 80200602.9 and European Patent Q 025 551 can be used in e.g. levels from 0.2 to 5 . The compositiNons herein can further contain a detergent oxygen bleach e.g. sodium perborate tetrahydrate, sodium perborate monohydrate, sodium percarbonate and mixtures thereof in amount from Q 4Q Organic sequestering substances, carrying polycarboxylate groups, e.g., citric acid, can optionally be used in levels from 0 to 20 . Organophosphonate sequestrants, such as ethylenediawinete tramethylene phosphoric acid, diethylenetriaminepentamethylenephosphonic acid, ethylaminodimethylenephosphonic acid and the alkali and or earthalkali salts of these organophosphonate sequestrants can also be used, preferably in levels from 0 3 . Detergent enzymes such as amylases, proteases, lipases and mixtures thereof can also be incorporated in levels from 0 to 2 . The compositions herein can also contain anionic surface active agents such as sulfonated and sulfated synthetic organic surfactants these anionic detergents can represent from 0 to 20 of the final composition. Nonionìc and or semi polar surfactants can also be used in levels from 0 to 20 . Suitable semi polar detergents include amine oxides. Depending upon the exact formulation parameters of a given product execution, the sum of matrix ingredients, solvents, additives and other optional ingredients can vary over a very broad range e.g. from 0 to 98 . While a major illustration in the context of this invention is directed to aqueous based liquid rinse added softener, it is understood that the combination of low ionexchange clay and cationic can also be utilized in delivering a fabric conditioning effect via other ways of incorporation.In all cases the broad range of clay cationic combinations still apply although the preferred ratios of clay to cationic and choice of type and level of additives will depend on the form of the softening agent and its desired physical and chemical properties. Some examples of alternative forms of the claytcationic softening agent are as follow not in any way meant to be all encompassing , 1. A granular or powdered composition of this invention can be produced by, for example spray cooling drying, granulation, agglomeration or extrusion. This execution can for example be added directly into the final rinse or predispersed in water before use in which case dispersibility is a key desired attribute.Alternatively the softening agent may be delivered in combination with normal granular detergent ingredients such as surfactant, builder, suspending agent, bleach, perfume etc.delivering its softening effect through the wash . In all granular forms, a key criteria is to maintain the product free flowing at all times and is generally achieved when the clay cationic with optional additives, has a softening point above normal room temperature, normally above 30 35 C. 2. A substrate execution where the softening composition is impregnated in or coated onto non woven or foam substrates or contained within a pouch or sachet. In the case of a substrate, the product can be added via the wash or into the hot air clothes dryer. Product characteristics are chosen to give a good balance between nongreasy non sticky product feel and good release in the washZdryer. In the case of product contained within a pouch or sachet, the key product characteristic desired is dispersibility with the release behaviour controlled by the material or sealing of the pouch Sachet, Examples of the substrate are non woven polyester or rayon with wood pulp, of the foam polyether or polyurethane and of the pouch polyvinyl acetate, By way of illustration, ingredient ranges for solids and substrate executions herein are as follow INGREDIENT BY WEIGHT RANGE Binary active mixture 10 99 consisting of clay 10 50 cationic fabric softener 90 50 Additives and processing aids 90 1 inclusive of sodium sulfate 0 70 tripolyphosphate 0 208 polyethylene glycol 0 10 copolymer of maleic an hydride and meth acrylic acid 0 108 brightener 0 5 aesthetics 0 5 photoactivator 0 1000 ppa germicide 0 2 sodium perborate 0 40 citric acid 0 20 enzyme 0 2 anionic surfactant 0 20 nonionic and or semi polar sur factant 0 20 organophosphonate sequestrant 0 3t.

The softness difference between the various swatches was evaluated on 4 replicates, in paired comparisons, by 2 expert judges thereby using a 0 4 scale psu whereby O means there is no difference 1 means I think there is a difference 2 means I know there is a difference 3 means I know there is a big difference 4 means There is a very large difference.
