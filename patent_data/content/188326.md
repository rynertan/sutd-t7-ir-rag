# SIS mixer having thin film wrap around edge contact.

## Abstract
A single substrate with a stripline circuit on one of its surfaces for use in a down converting mixer has a thin metallic film deposited utilizing photolithographic techni ques into two free ends one end with the junction section of the stripline circuit for establishing a ground path with the metal block upon which the substrate rests and the other end with the filter section of the stripline circuit for establishing the intermediate frequency signal path with the inner conductor of coaxial cable.
