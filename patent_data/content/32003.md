# A device for converting alcohols to ethers and methods of running and of modifying a compression ignition engine to enable use therein of an alcohol ether fuel.

## Abstract
The invention provides a device for converting an alcohol to an ether when fitted to a compression ignition engine, the device comprising a heat exchanger 28 having an inlet to receive the alcohol end an outlet in communication with the inlet end of a catalytic conversion chamber 44 which con tains a catalyst for conversion of an alcohol to an ether. The conversion chamber 44 has an outlet pipe 46 to lead the ether to a cylinder 32 of a compression ignition engine. Alcohol is fed from a storage tank 10 along lines 18 and 48 direct to the cylinder 32 and along line 26 to heat exchanger 28 . The invention also comprises a method of modifying a compression ignition engine using the device and a method of running the modified engine.
