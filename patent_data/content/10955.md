# PROCESS FOR THE TREATMENT OF GLASS YARN AND GLASS YARN OBTAINED BY THIS PROCESS

## Abstract
A process for the treatment of glass yarn in which the yarn is impregnated with a low viscosity solution of a thermosetting binder in an organic solvent, the viscosity of said solution being not greater than 50 centipoise 0.05 Pascal seconds at 25 C solvent is then evaporat ed from the impregnated yarn the yarn is further impregnated with a high viscosity solution of a thermo setting binder in an organic solvent and solvent is again evaporated from the impregnated yarn. The process improves the properties of the glass yarn when used in the manufacture of glass reinforced composites.
