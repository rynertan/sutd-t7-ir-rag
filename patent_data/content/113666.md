# Hydroxybenzylcyclopentadienes and derivatives thereof.

## Abstract
Hindered hydroxybenzylcyclopentadienes and deriva tives thereof, useful as antioxidants, are prepared by reacting cyclopentadiene, an alkali metal, and a hindered p methylphenol having a displaceable group attached to the methyl group in the presence of a non protic solvent or in one step, by reacting cyclopentadiene, hindered phenol that is devoid of a group in the para position, formaldehyde, an amine, water, and an alkali metal hydroxide in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst or in one step, by reacting cyclopentadiene and a hindered substituted p methyl phenol containing a displaceable group, in the presence of a non protic solvent, water, an alkali metal hydroxide and a phase transfer catalyst. These compounds readily dimerize whereas the bis compounds are prepared in presence of an excess amount of the substituted p methylphenol.
