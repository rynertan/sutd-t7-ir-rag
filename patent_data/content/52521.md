# Linear shaped charges.

## Abstract
A linear shaped charge 1 has a v shaped indentation 9 cladded with e.g. lead 2 . The explosive body is formed of discrete explosive elements 3, 4, 5 , such as detonator cords, at least one of which 3 is positioned along the apex of the indentation 9 so that detonation can be initiated in that region.
