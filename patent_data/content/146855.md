# SHOOT THRU PROTECTION FOR X RAY GENERATOR INVERTER

## Abstract
In a transistor inverter with series connected transistors adapted to conduct alternately, means are provided to sense when one of the two is conducting and to inhibit the turmng on of the other transistor during that period. The on condition is detected by sensing the collector emitter voltage of the transistor involved, and for responsively energizing an optical transmitter to provide a signal back to the main controller for use in inhibiting the turning on of the other transistor.
