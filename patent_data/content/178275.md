# A FLOOR CONSTRUCTION SUITABLE FOR INSTALLATION IN ROOMS CONTAINING SWITCHGEAR, COMPUTERS, AND LIKE ELECTRICAL APPARATUS, AND A METHOD FOR PRODUCING SUCH A FLOOR CONSTRUCTION

## Abstract
A floor construction, suitably for use in rooms contain ing electrical switchgear, computers and like apparatus, comprises a plurality of mutually parallel, elongated and lon gitudinally extending first joists 8, 9 , and a plurality of mutu ally parallel, elongated, transversely extending second joists 12, 13, 14, 15 extending at right angles across the first joists 8, 9 . The joists define one or more square and or rectangular cavities, which are covered by one or more right angled slabs 7, 7 , 7 . These slabs form the surface of the floor and are dimensioned so as to be supported along the whole of their edge portions by the upper surfaces of adja cent joist sections. The elongated, longitudinally extending first joists 8, 9 are provided with a plurality of first recesses 20 spaced at a given distance apart. These first joists 8 , of reduced flexural resistance, are arranged to lie on a supporting foundation. The elongated, transversely extending second joists 12 are provided with a plurality of second recesses 21 spaced at a given distance apart. The transversely ex tending joists 12 of reduced flexural resistance are ar ranged to rest on the longitudinally extending joists 8 or the foundation 1 . A first recess 20 located in a longitudinally extending joist 8 is arranged to co act with a second recess 21 in a transversely extending joist 12 so as to locate the upper surface 22 of the longitudinally extending joist 8 and the upper surface 23 in the transversely extending joist 12 in one and the same plane. At least one slab 7 is provided with means for locking the slab against movement in a plane relating to the upper surfaces of the joists. The means 41 provided on the slab 7 is also arranged to lock the lon gitudinally extending and transversely extending joists 8, 12 at right angles to one another and parallel with one anoth er.
