# Interferometric wavefront measurement.

## Abstract
Apparatus is disclosed for the phase measurement of an interference pattern produced by an unequal path interfero meter. The invention comprises in one embodiment the use of a diode laser light source whose wavelength is varied so that the phase difference between the two wavefronts producing the interference pattern is modulated by a known amount. The modulated interference pattern is photosensed with an imaging device, and the signals processed to provide a phase map representing the optical path difference be tween the reference and measurement wavefronts of the interferometer.
