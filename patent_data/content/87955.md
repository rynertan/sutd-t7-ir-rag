# Immobilized inorganic diffusion barriers and the use thereof in the separation of small molecular species from a solution.

## Abstract
The modification of a diffusion barrier by the deposition of one or more inorganic species within the pores and onto the surfaces of said diffusion barrier to form an immobilized inorganic crystalline lattice barrier or molecular grid having substantially uniform permeability, to separate and select different ionic species, giving a high efficiency of separation with a low energy input. The immobilized inorganic diffusion barriers are used for selective separation of small molecules e,g. molecular weight less than about 1,000 daltons and provide means for the more effective separation of ionic species. A method is provided for the low cost removal of ions from molasses, to enhance fermentation efficiency and to improve its usefullness as a stock feed supplement, or to be followed by other treatments to reduce and or remove higher molecular weignt substances, proteins and waxes, to produce sugar syrups and caramel substitutes.
