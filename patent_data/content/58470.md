# Trunk interface circuit with current compensation.

## Abstract
A trunk interface circuit useful for remotely terminating a two wire central office trunk at a remote telephone facility includes a current compensated miniature transformer. The transformer includes windings for coupling voice band signals between the trunk and the remote telephone facility and a compensating winding for reducing d.c. flux associ ated with supervisory d.c. current applied to the trunk at the central office. A circuit connected with a first transformer winding provides signal indication of magnitude and either of two possible directions of current flow in the first winding. A bidirectional current regulation circuit conducts a compen sating current in either of two directions in the compensating winding. The compensating current is regulated in accord ance with the indicating signal from the circuit connected with the first winding to reduce the d.c. flux in the transformer. The indicating signal is also used by a supervis ory signal detector to couple supervisory information to the remote telephone facility.
