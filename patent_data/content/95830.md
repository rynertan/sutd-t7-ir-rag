# Amorphous metals and articles made thereof.

## Abstract
An amorphous Fe B Si alloy and article made there from is provided having improved castability while main taining good magnetic properties, ductility and improved thermal stability. Fe B Si alloys containing 0.1 4.0 Cr, in atomic percent, have improved castability and amorphous ness. An alloy is provided generally consisting of 6 10 B, 14 17 Si, 0.1 4.0 Cr, and the balance iron, and no more than incidental impurities. An article made from the alloy and a method of casting an amorphous strip material from the alloy is also provided.
