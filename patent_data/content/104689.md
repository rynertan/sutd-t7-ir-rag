# Analog to digital conversion circuit.

## Abstract
An analog to digital conversion circuit in which the coarse bits are produced by a counter 25 , is made suitable for processing a video signal by having in the event of fast large amplitude variations an analog to digital converter 3 connected to the input 1 of the conversion circuit write into the counter in response to a threshold crossing signal produced by a difference threshold circuit 91, 93, 57 , while slow and small amplitude variations are followed by a correction circuit 97, 113, 111, 119, 61, 63 coupled to an output 49 of a digital to analog converter 47 which is connected to the outputs of the conversion circuit, the correction circuit also being coupled to the input 1 of the conversion circuit, which correction circuit corrects the counting position, while the fine bits are obtained from a fine analog to digital converter 113, 97, 103, 105 which is responsive to the difference between the signal at the input 1 of the conversion circuit and the signal at the output 49 of the digital to analog converter 47 .
