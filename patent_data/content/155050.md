Field of invention This invention relates to an encoding device for applying to an article, such as a container, a selectively adjustable code, and reading apparatus for recognizing such code. The automated handling of articles, such as containers, carried by a conveyor is important in the operation of post handling offices, warehouses, etc. The articles, such as for instance containers, having letters stored therein are to be routed by the conveyor selectively to various destinations automatically, economically, and in a reliable manner.At each location where a point or switch has been included in the conveying circuit path a code reader is installed for reading the code pattern of an arriving container in order to appropriately set the associated switch into a condition whereby the container is enabled to reach its desired destination corresponding to the setting of the code read out therefrom. 2. Prior art A method and apparatus for facilitating the automatic sorting of mail by optical scanning apparatus is known from US patent 4,317,030. In accordance with this prior art each mailing package is provided with a first sheet having a distinct optical reflectivity, and a second sheet of contrasting reflectivity, overlying the first sheet and having a prearranged array of apertures therethrough. The array of apertures is coded to represent a desired address. By causing the first sheet to underlie such a coded array of apertures the scanning equipment is enabled to read the desired address code.The array of apertures can be punched through said second sheet, and the first sheet is caused to underlie such array of apertures at a stationary position relative to said second sheet. The above reference is silent as to any particulars regarding structure and operation of automatic scanning apparatus for reading a code pattern of the above type. French patent application 2 302 562 relates to an encoding technique similar to what has been disclosed in the aforementioned US patent.Said French patent application teaches to employ such encoding technique as a means for selectively identifying a moving article. This prior art further discloses code reading apparatus. This prior art code reader includes at least two photo sensitive sensor cells disposed next to each other at an intermediate distance corresponding to the spacing between two consecutive code elements a shift register for storing a code pattern which has been conveyed past the two sensor cells, and OR gating circuitry for producing clock signals for controlling said shift register in response to code elements which have been sequentially sensed by the sensor cells. This prior art relies on specific code patterns, with the exclusion of patterns containing non reflecting code elements. Thereby its field of application is restricted. US patent 3,751,640 discloses an encoding device, i.e. a logic card which is movable along a conveyor with a carrier or article through a reading station having a plurality of arrangeable light sources on one side and a like plurality of arrangeable light sensors on the other side. Such logic card includes movable blocks in one or more elongated slots which are arrangeable to define one or more patterns of openings permitting the light sources and sensors to communicate under certain conditions to initiate a conveyor dispatch function. A reading station arrangement can be selectively set to recognize one or more different codes of passing cards. For reading a code pattern including n code elements n light source sensor combinations and two light source sensor combinations for keying purposes are required in a reading station.By its design the opening in each elongated slot included in a logic card, is movable to one of ten positions. Thereby such logic card can be quickly set to represent any one of 1000 different and distinctive codes, if 3 slots are included.B. Summary of the inventionThis invention provides an encoding device for applying an optically readable coded array of binary code elements to an article or container on a conveyor. The encoding device is adapted for passage through one or more stations which are designed to read the encoding device to set a point or switch included in the conveying path in accordance with the code read out therefrom. Such an encoding device includes a first blade and a second blade overlying said first blade and having an array of apertures therethrough. Said first blade is provided with a distinct surface area having an optical reflectivity which is contrasting to the optical reflectivity of said second blade, whereby said apertures in a position overlying said surface area provide said coded array.In an aspect of this invention said first blade and second blade are mounted for a relative sliding movement to each other for shifting said distinct surface area and said array of apertures relative to each other for selectively setting one of 2n different and distinctive codes, wherein n is the number of said apertures said second blade having means for displaying a restricted area of said first blade spaced from said apertures said distinct surface area on said first blade is shaped and dimensioned in such a manner that its longitudinal dimension corresponds to the longitudinal dimension of said array of apertures a row of symbols being provided within an elongated area, whereby any selected one of said codes and its associated one of said symbols area concurrently perceivable through said apertures and said display means, respectively.In another aspect of the invention a reading station for reading a code pattern provided by an encoding device of the above type, includes at least two light sensor means mounted with a predetermined mutual spacing in a direction aligned with said array of apertures comparator means for comparing signals from said light sensor means to each other to produce a control signal counting means for counting the number x of code elements having the same binary value and control means which in dependence of said control signal produce an output signal corresponding to either said number x or another number 2n x .In a more narrow aspect of the invention in the encoding device said first blade is mounted for permitting a sliding movement relative to the overlying second blade which has an inspection window for displaying any one of said symbols, said first blade having indicator means for indicating that one of said symbols which corresponds to the selected code position of said first blade. A significant advantage of the invention lies in the convenient and reliable operation of the encoding device. When set to represent any one of the different and distinct binary codes, its corresponding decimal representation is concurrently displayed. Thereby unskilled personnel is enabled to unambiguously recognize any selected code applied to a container.Another significant advantage of the invention is the relative simplicity and reliability of the reading station arrangement. Incorrect readings due to variations of the transfer velocity of the conveyor system are eliminated.A reading station is further readily adapted to correctly read out a code irrespective of whether a container having an encoding device of this invention mounted thereon is placed on the conveyor with the code pattern turned towards either the one or the opposite side of the conveying path.C.

Detailed description of the drawingsIt will be obvious that the invention is not limited to the following embodiments, which are specifically described in the context of encoding devices for applying a desired destination code to letter mail containers. Such a code is read by passing through one or more reading stations disposed along the conveying path, whereby signals are derived for automatically routing a container to its destination as represented by the selected code applied thereon.The embodiment shown in figures 1 3 is illustrative of an encoding device of the present invention. As shown specifically in fig. 3 this embodiment includes a base plate 1, which is designed to be held and supported on one side of a container. Preferably base plate 1 is made integrally with the container side surface. Base plate 1 has fixedly mounted thereon a housing 2 having a substantially flat upper blade portion 3. Upper blade portion 3 includes an array of n, in the embodiment shown five, equidistant window apertures 4 through 8.At the opposite ends of the array of apertures two rectangular surface areas 9 and 10 are provided on upper blade portion 3, each having an optical reflectivity which is contrasting to the optical reflectivity of the remaining portion of upper blade portion 3. For example areas 9 and 10 are white coloured while upper blade portion 3 is black, i.e.light absorbing. Upper blade portion 3 further includes an elongated slot 11, extending below and parallel to the array of window apertures.Mounted within housing 2 for slidable movement therein is a slide 12 having its upper surface which is shown in fig. 2 underlying upper blade portion 3. Fixedly mounted on the upper surface of slide 12 are two manipulating knobs 13, 14, extending through elongated slot 11.When mounted within housing 2 the rectangular surface area including two light absorbing strips 15, 16 and an intermediate light reflecting strip 17 on slide 12, will be in alignment with the array of window apertures. The longitudinal dimension of intermediate strip 17 is selected to correspond with the longitudinal dimension of the array of window apertures 4 8. By manipulating knobs 13, 14 slide 12 is caused to selectively underlie the array of window apertures, so that the encoding device can be set to represent any one of 2n different and distinct code patterns.The encoding diagram shown in fig. 7 is illustrative of ten distinct and different code patterns each including five binary code elements, together with their respective decimal value code . The black coloured code elements correspond to light absorbing surface area portions of slide 12, while the white coloured code elements correspond to light reflecting surface area portions of slide 12 as made visible through the respective window apertures 4 8 of upper blade portion 3.As shown in fig. 2, slide 12 is provided with two resilient legs 18, 19 made integral with slide 12. Each leg at its free end is provided with a cam portion 20, 21 shaped and dimensioned to co operate with fittingly shaped indentations 22 provided along an opposing longitudinal inner edge 23 provided within housing 2. By snap in interaction between cam portions 20, 21 and indentations 22, slide 12 can be selectively set into a number of discrete and different positions wherein slide 12 is held firmly interlocked within housing 2. As further shown in fig. 2 slide 12 on its upper surface has a row of symbols, i.e. decimal digits 0 through 9. This row of symbols is disposed in alignment with an inspection window 24, which in the embodiment shown in fig. 1 has been recessed in elongated slot 11.The positions of the symbols, i.e. decimal digits 0 through 9, are selected to correspond with the associated code patterns in accordance with the relations as shown in fig. 7. With the above arrangement a selected code pattern and its decimal representation are concurrently displayed via the array of window apertures 4 8 and the inspection window 24.Fig. 1 illustrates a code pattern including three consecutive white elements and two consecutive black elements, which code pattern represents the decimal value of 3, which is displayed through window 24. The above arrangement enables an operator to conveniently recognize the relation between a desired destination code decimal digit and its binary code representation.In an alternative embodiment the decimal digits are provided on an elongated transparent area of upper blade portion 3, while slide 12 has an indicator means adapted to slide along the stationary decimal digits in unison therewith to indicate a selected one of said symbols.The above arrangement enables the operator to readily determine the direction along which slide 12 has to be shifted in order to change a current code setting into a desired other one.Still another embodiment of an encoding device of the invention will be described by making reference to figs. 4 and 5.Fig. 4 illustrates a base portion 25 having means not shown for fixedly mounting this base portion on one side of a container. As schematically shown in fig. 4, base portion 25 includes two aligned rectangular surface areas 26 and 27 and an intermediate surface area 28. The optical reflectivity of areas 26 and 27 is contrasting to the optical reflectivity of intermediate surface area 28. In the embodiment shown areas 26 and 27 are light absorbing e.g. black, while area 28 is light reflecting, i.e. white. Fig. 5 illustrates a slide 29, which together with base portion 25 of fig. 4 constitutes a two part embodiment of an encoding device of the invention. In this embodiment slide 29 is mounted to overlie base portion 25 for slidable movement therealong. As shown in fig. 5 slide 29 includes an array of window apertures 30 through 34 and an inspection aperture 37. Similar to the embodiment of figs. 1 3, two rectangular surface areas 35, 36 are provided at the opposite ends of the array of window apertures. Their optical reflectivity e.g. white coloured, is contrasting to the optical reflectivity of the remaining surface area of slide 29, which in this example is black. In essence the above described embodiment is the same as the embodiments described above with reference to figs. 1 3. A point of difference is to be seen therein that in the former embodiment the array of window apertures 30 34, together with inspection aperture 37 and rectangular surface areas 35 and 36, are slidable relative to stationary mounted base portion 25.In the embodiment shown in figs. 4 and 5 base portion 25 includes two guiding rails 37, 38 extending in parallel to each other. These two guiding rails define therebetween a guiding path permitting slide 29 to be shifted longitudinally therealong.In this embodiment the row of symbols, more in particular the row of digits 0 through 9, are provided in longitudinal alignment with the reflecting surface area 28 on base portion 25. Slide 29 can be selectively set into ten distinct and different positions relative to base portion 25 to represent ten distinct and different code patterns each including five code elements such as 30, 31, 32, 33, 34.These code patterns and their assigned code representations are shown in the following table EMI9.1 tb 30 SEP 31 SEP 32 SEP 33 SEP 34 SEP code tb O SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 tb O SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 1 SEP 1 tb O SEP 0 SEP SEP 0 SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 2 tb O SEP 0 SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 3 tb 011114 SEP tb SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 5 tb SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 0 SEP 6 tb SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 7 tb SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 8 tb SEP 1 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 9 tb Herein 0 and 1 ,respectively correspond to a light absorbing, i.e. black and to a light reflecting, i.e. white code element, respectively. Each one of the code representations digits 0 through 9 is perceivable via inspection window aperture 37 through slide 29. In alternative embodiment inspection aperture 37 through slide 29 is positioned above or below the middle window aperture 32. The row of digits 0 through 9 then is positioned above or below light reflecting area 28 on base portion 25.The reference in the following description to a reading station as schematically shown in figs. 6 through 9 is for convenience only and is not intended to be interpreted a limitation on the invention described herein. The concepts of the invention apply equally to many other embodiments of reading stations. In general such a reading station is designed to implement following functions to sense a selected code pattern of an encoding device mounted on a container being conveyed past the reading station position to recognize the sensed code pattern for producing a control signal representing the selected code and to produce in response to such control signal a command signal for setting a point switch included in the conveyor path configuration for routing the container to a desired destination corresponding to the sensed code pattern.A preferred embodiment of an encoding device of the subject invention can be conveniently set to represent any one of 10 different and distinctive codes 0 through 9. As has been illustrated in figs. 6 and 9 each code is a combination of five distinctive binary code elements defined by window apertures such as 4 through 8, wherein each code element can be either a light reflecting rectangular area, or a light absorbing, i.e. non reflecting, rectangular area. At the opposite ends of such an array of five code elements,reference elements are provided in the form of light reflecting rectangular areas such as 9 and 10.In the illustrated embodiment reference element 10 represents a start bit and a stop bit as well, in case the container together with the encoding device mounted thereon is conveyed in the one direction as has been indicated by the arrow. This because the requirement has to be met that a container having an encoding device mounted thereon, can be placed on the conveyor into two distinctive and different positions, namely with its encoding device turned either to the one side, or to the other side of the conveyor path. Therefore a reading station includes two sets of code sensing devices disposed at the opposite sides of the conveyor as has been schematically shown in figs. 6 and 9. In the embodiment as shown in fig. 6 each code sensing device includes three photosensitive cells FCR1, FCR2,FAR and FCL1, FCL2, FAL, respectively.In an aspect of the invention sensor cells FCR1 and FCR2 FCL1 andFCL2 are fixedly mounted with their respective receiving apertures aligned with the last code element 4 and the associated reference element 10 9 as has been schematically shown in figs. 6 and 9.In another aspect of the invention the circuit arrangement for recognizing a selected code pattern is designed to respond to the trailing edges of the electric pulses delivered from the sensor elements when such code pattern and its fore running reference element are passing by.To illustrate the sensing recognizing process reference will be made to figs. 6 and 7.When a container with its encoding device mounted thereon, arrives at the reading station, the fore running reference element 10 will be firstly sensed by sensor cell FCR1. This with the assumption that the container is conveyed in a direction as indicated by the arrow, while having the encoding device mounted on its side turned towards the code sensing device having cells FCR1, FCR2 and FAR included therein. Once reference element 10 has left the spatial area defined by the receiving aperture of sensor cell FCR1, i.e. on the occurrence of the trailing edge of the first electric pulse produced by cell FCR1, a counting process for counting the light reflecting code elements to follow, is enabled. Thereby the number of light reflecting code elements, i.e. white areas of the preset code, is counted. When the reference element 10 has come into alignment with the light sensor cell FCR2, the following functions will be implemented the counting process is disabled in such a manner that in case code element 4,which then is aligned with sensor cellFCR1, would be white, this condition is included in the count and the condition of last code element 4 white or black is examined by making a comparison between the signals delivered by sensor cellsFCR1 and FCR2 Because in the situation outlined above sensor cellFCR2 is aligned with reference element 10, i.e. always white, the result of the above comparison operation unambiguously indicates whether said last code element 4, which then is aligned with sensor cell FCR1, is white or black. As appears from inspection of the code diagram shown in fig. 7, the condition of the last code element 4 is a criterion for determining whether a count of 1, 2, 3 or 4 represents code 1, 2, 3 or 4 on the one hand, or code 9, 8, 7 or 6 on the other.As will be further noted from fig. 7 a count of 5 and 0, respectively unambiguously represents code 5 and 0, respectively.Therefore the decoder is conveniently designed to produce an output signal indicative of codes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5,respectively, on the occurrence of a count of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5,respectively and in case last code element 4 has been found to be white, while an output signal indicative of codes 9, 8, 7 or 6,respectively is delivered on the occurrence of a count of 1, 2, 3 or 4,respectively and in case last code element 4 appeared to be black.As has been pointed out hereinbefore, the reading station is designed to also implement its functions in the alternative situation wherein the container has been positioned on the conveyor with the encoding device mounted thereon turned towards the code sensing device including sensor cells FCL1, FCL2 and PAL. In this situation and assuming the direction of travel is the same as has been shown in figs. 6 and 9, the code pattern as depicted therein in the order 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 9,is moving with its order reversed past sensor cells FCL1, FCL2 and FAL, i.e. in the order 9, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10. In this alternative situation the number of white code elements is the same as in the situation shown in figs. 6 and 9. However, the position of the white elements has been shifted, while their order has been reversed.In order to cause the decoder to produce the same output signal irrespective of the position wherein the container has been placed onto the conveyor, in the above alternative situation, the signals from light sensor cell FCL1 are applied inverted to the decoder.An important technical advantage of a system of the subject invention is found in the independence of speed of travel of containers being conveyed. For instance when counting the number of white code elements,it is irrelevant how long a sensor cell is irradiated by reflected light. This because a white code element increases the count by one only when it disappears.Fig. 8 shows a more detailed diagram of an embodiment illustrative of a reading station capable to implement the above described functions of sensing, counting and delivering the correct code representation. For disengaging the sensing decoding arrangement, for timing the instant for executing a switching command for a point switch , and for checking an encoding device, use has been made of position reporting cells such as FAR and FAL. Such cell includes a light emitting means producing a collimated beam of light radiation and a light receiving means having an aperture designed for receiving a pencil beam of light reflected from the container side.When for instance in the situation wherein a container having an encoding device mounted thereon arrives within the receiving aperture of light sensor cells FAR and or FAL, these cells provide a signal whereby a reset condition of the reading circuit arrangement is disabled, thereby bringing the circuit arrangement in a state ready for accepting and processing signals from the other light sensor cells when the container continues to further proceed therealong. Once the container has left the receiving aperture of cells FAR and or FAL, the reading circuit arrangement again is brought into its reset condition.Fig. 8 schematically shows an embodiment to illustrate the principles of a reading device for recognizing a code pattern of an encoding device of this invention. Light sensor cells FCR1 FCR2 FCL1 FCL2 and FA correspond to the light sensor cells as shown in fig. 6. As has been shown in fig. 8 JK flip flops JKFF1 and JKFF2 have their respective J and K inputs permanently on a high and a low level, respectively. Thereby a pulse signal applied to the C input causes output Q to become high in response to its trailing edge, which condition irrespective of further pulses on the C input, is sustained until a reset signal is applied to the R input.By the combination of flip flop JKFF1 and associated AND gate AG1, pulse signals from cell FCR1 and FCL1 corresponding with white code elements such as 4, 5 and 6 only, in other words with the exclusion of a pulse signal corresponding to fore running reference element such as 10, are delivered to a reset table counter CR1. The combination of flip flopJKFF2 and associated AND gate AG2 is effective to disable transfer of signals to counter CR1, as soon as the first white element seen by cell FCR2 FCL2 , i.e. reference element 10 9 , has passed therealong. Hereby white code elements only, in other words with the exclusion of after running reference element such as 9 10 , are applied to counter CR1.The combination of AND gate AG3 and SR flipflop SRFF1 implements the function of comparing the first white element seen by cell FCR2, i.e. reference element 10, and the condition of the code element which then concurrently is in alignment with cell FCR1, i.e. the code element as defined by window aperture 4. As becomes apparent from inspection of the table shown in fig. 7, a match, i.e. the code element seen by light sensor cell FCR1 or FCL has the same value white as the reference element which then is in alignment with light sensor cell FCR2 or FCL2, indicates that the count then stored in counter CR1 has to be read out directly, i.e.unchanged. If a match occurs output Q of flip flop SRFF1 will be high whereby each one of four AND gates AG4 AG7 connected to the respective four output leads of counter CR1 is enabled. Thereby the count, i.e.the code representation of the code read out, stored in counter CR1, via AND gates AG4 AG7 and OR gates OG1 OG4 is delivered on four output leads OL1 OL4. The output signal thus obtained is further processed by means not shown to control a switching action or any other action desired.If a mismatch occurs, i.e. the code element in alignment with light sensor cell FCR1 or FCL1 has another value black than the value of the reference element which is then in alignment with light sensor cell FCR2 or FCL2, the Q output of flip flip SRFF1 will be high. Consequently, each one of four AND gates AG8 AG11 is enabled, while AND gates AG4 AG7 are disabled. Connected to the Q output of flip flop SRFF1 is an AND gate AG12, which is enable if following conditions occur concurrently Q output high count n of counter CR1 satisfies the relation 0 n 10 and Q output of flip flop JKFF2 high. When thus enabled,AND gate AG 12 applies a start signal to an astable multivibrator ALPS, which is designed to produce a train of HF pulses, for instance having a rate of 100 kc s, for driving counter CR1 and an auxiliary counterCR2.Because in the arrangement shown in fig. 8, a binary control signal indicative of the current count n of counter CR1 control signal is high if 0 n 10, control signal is low if n o or n 10 is applied to one input of AND gate AG12, auxialiary counter CR2 is caused to count 10 n , if counter CR1 having a count n stored therein, is driven by AMV to count from n to 10. Once counter CR1 has reached a count of 10, AND gate AG12 is disabled whereby counterCR2 is caused to stop at the count of 10 n. Via enabled AND gatesAG8 AG11 and OR gates OG1 OG4, the count of auxiliary counter CR2 now is applied to output leads OL1 OL4. OMR7 is a one shot multivibrator for defining a time window pulse signal which enables AND gate AG3 for an interval of time which is a certain fraction of a time interval corresponding with a single code element. The above time window pulse signal is of specific importance in situations wherein the last code elements which come into alignment with light sensor cell FCR1 or FCR2 are black. See fig. 7, for instance codes 6 through 9. The above time window pulse signal unambiguously defines a time slot corresponding to the last code element which has come into alignment with light sensor cell FCR1 or FCL1.In this connection it is to be recalled that due to the selected longitudinal distance between light sensor cellsFCR1 and FCR2 FCL1 and FCL2 it is ensured that a comparison is made between the leading fore running reference element such as 10 and the last code element such as 4, which has come into alignment with light sensor cell FCR1 or FCL1. The signals produced by light sensor cell FCL1 are inverted by an inverter J before being applied to the above described comparator arrangement.Thereby it is ensured that irrespective of whether the encoding device of this invention is mounted on a container side turned towards light sensor cells FCR1, FCR2, FAR or to light sensor cells FCL1, FCL2, FAL, the same result is delivered to output leads OI.1 OL4. The instant at which the Q output of flip flop JKFF2 goes high, is advantageously used as a reference for producing an enable signal on control leadCL for processing equipment adapted to utilize the output signal on output leads OL1 OL4. To this end the transitions on the Q output of flip flop JKFF2 are delayed through a delay device D. The delay introduced is selected to correspond to the time necessary for the counters CR1 and CR2 and associated circuitry to produce an output signal on output leads OL1 OL4.Light sensor cells FAR and FAL are positioned in such a manner that a reset signal R produced thereby, is disabled in as long as a container is in alignment with these cells.As will be understood the various operations and functions described above with reference to fig. 8 can be readily implemented by many other embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example a microprocessor controlled by an appropriate program can be advantageously employed for the code recognition and further processing functions.A further embodiment of a reading station has as a special feature the capability of checking whether an encoding device has been damaged, has become untolerably covered with dust or dirt, and or has stickers provided thereon, whereby the encoding device could cause the reading station to malfunction. In a situation wherein such a defective encoding device is conveyed past a reading station having the above special feature, an alarm can be produced, while the container with its defective encoding device thereon is routed into a side track.The design of a reading station having the above special feature, relies on the following characteristics of the code Datterns employed a code patterns for codes 0 through 4 have their fifth position, i.e. 5, coloured black b code patterns for codes 5 through 9 have their fifth position, i.e.5, coloured white c in code patterns for codes 0 through 4, any white element which has passed a sensor cell cannot be followed by a black element d in code patterns for codes 5 through 9, any black element which has passed a sensor cell cannot be followed by a white element e when the conveyor is moving, the time interval wherein a light sensor cell is permitted to receive light radiation is restricted to a certain extent f the first light sensor cell is not allowed to produce a number of pulses exceeding a value of seven g the first and last light sensor cell must have seen concurrently light radiation, when a container has passed along the reading apparatus and h light sensor cells are allowed to see light and dark only at one side of the container. In view of the above characteristics, at each side of the conveyor three light sensor cells, FC1, FC2, FC3 and FCl , FC2 , FC3 , are provided as has been schematically shown in figure 9. When a moving container arrives witilintheoperating range of the reading apparatus, via light sensor cell FC1, the number of white code elements is counted until cell FC3 sees light. Once reference element 10 has passed by at one instant a check is made to determine whether cellsFC1 and FC2 both see light. In the affirmative case the fifth code element, i.e. 5, is white which means that the code pattern under consideration corresponds to one of the code representations 5 through 9. If on the other hand cells FC1 and FC2 do not concurrently see light, the fifth code element, i.e. 5, is black which means that the code pattern under consideration corresponds to one of the code representations 0 through 4. The result of these comparisons determines whether a check in view of point c or d above, has to be carried out. This can be done by means of cells FC1 and FC2. When at a certain instant of time cell FC3 sees light, a check in view of points f and g above can be carried out. With this check code error detection is feasible. Thereby an encoding device presenting a distorted code, for example due to a sticker which has been inadvertently disposed on one or more of the window apertures, can be detected and sorted out.
