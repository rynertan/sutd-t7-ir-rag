# DIGITAL FLUID PRESSURE FLOW RATE AND POSITION CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
A control valve or system of control valves governs fluid flow by digitally comparing a feedback signal from a fluid control loop with a command signal corresponding to a desired flow rate in a high pressure operating fluid flow line. In the preferred embodiment, a control valve system, such as a pressure relief valve, is operated under the control of a digital computer. The pressure relief valve is operated at a control pressure to regulate flow in an operating hydraulic system. The control pressure chamber is coupled to a relief line through a control pressure reduction valve and to a control pressure enhancement valve which is in communica tion with the operating line of fluid flow. A feedback signal indicating actual control pressure, flow rate or load position is compared with a command control pressure, flow rate or position. Preferably, the results of several comparisons are averaged together to provide an error correction signal. The error correction signal selectively actuates the pressure enhancement and pressure reduction valves to maintain the desired control pressure, flow rate or load position. The system preferably includes a deactuating means which limits actuation of the control pressure enhancement and reduc tion valves to the duration of puises of a width related to the magnitude of the error correction signal.
