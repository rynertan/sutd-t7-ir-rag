# Improvements in or relating to pulsed solid state systems.

## Abstract
A pulsed solid state system having solid state elements 80 responsive to drive pulses for generating RF signal pulses includes a timing circuit 20,22,24 generating signals which are applied to a pulse forming circuit 33 to provide preheat pulses and immediately subsequent thereto the drive pulses which are applied to the solid state elements 80 so as to reduce chirp and level variations of the generated RF signal pulses. The preheat and drive pulses are formed by transis tors 70, 74 which are rendered conductive when their current return paths are established through resistors 34, 44 whose values determine the levels of the preheat and drive pulses. The duration of the preheat pulses may be made responsive to ambient temperature by using a negative temperature coefficient thermistor as the time determining element of the timing circuit 20,22 24 and the level of the preheat pulses may be made responsive to ambient temperature by using positive temperature coefficient silicon thermistors in the above mentioned current return path.
