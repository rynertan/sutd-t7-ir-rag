# Light transmitting fiber.

## Abstract
A plastic light transmitting fiber having a core sheath structure. A polymer having methacrylimide or N substituted methacrylimide units is used for the core component. A polymer having a refractive index smaller by at least 1 than that of the polymer of the core component is used for the sheath component, The heat resistance of the light transmitting fiber is highly improved.
