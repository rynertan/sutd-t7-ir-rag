# Rapidly dissolving calcium hypochlorite particles.

## Abstract
Rapidly dissolving particles of hydrated calcium hypochlorite are produced in a process comprising producing agglomerated granules of hydrated calcium hypochlorite by agitation means. The agglomerated hydrated calcium hypochlorite granules are then crushed to produce hydrated calcium hypochlorite particles having a displacement bulk density of at least about 1.0 grams per milliliter. The crushed multi layered hydrated calcium hypochlorite particles recovered dissolved in water bodies such as swimming pools significantly faster than commercially produced calcium hypochlorite granules, regardless of the particle size selected.
