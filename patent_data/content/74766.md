# SELF CLEANING VANES

## Abstract
A self cleaning vane 10 is disclosed positioned in the fluid duct 30 and adapted for deflecting fluid as it moves through the duct 30 and further for preventing the accumu lation on the vane 10 of particulate matter entrained in the fluid. Vane 10 comprises a vane body 11 defining a forward edge portion 12 which faces upstream into the moving fluid. Forward edge portion 12 has a pre determined angle of incidence to the direction of travel of the moving fluid sufficient to overcome frictional adherence of the particular matter. Vane body 11 also has a free end 16 spaced apart from the inner walls of duct 30 . The vane body also defines a rearward edge portion 13 downstream of forward edge portion 12 and defines an angle within duct 30 corresponding to the extent of deflection to be applied to the moving fluid. One of the embodiments includes alternat ing vane bodies 11 positioned on opposite walls of the duct 30 .
