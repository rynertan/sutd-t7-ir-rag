## Description
Electric rotating machine The present invention relates to an electric rotating machine according to the preamble of the appending Claim 1. In manufacturing small electric motors, particularly commutator motors, it is desired that the assembly work be performed in a completely automatic way.Up to now, this has not been possible due to the fact that the termination of the stator wire ends had to be carried out manually. The termination process included the steps of removing insulation, applying an insulating hose, soldering and fixing of the wires, which steps are time consuming. The invention has for its object to reduce the manual working steps being part of the process of assembling an electric rotating machine of the kind specified. In this connection it is desirable that after completion of the stator windings, having been machine wound directly on the Stator core, the wire ends of the windings in an automatic process be conveyed and connected to pins being part of terminal blocks. The object is achieved by an electric rotating machine having the characterizing features stated in the appending Claim 1. Preferred embodiments appear from the subclaims. An embodiment of the invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figs. 1 3 show a commutator motor in three different side views. The motor, generally referred to by the reference numeral 10, comprises a stator core 11 which in the usual way consists of stator laminations which are stacked. The stator core, a first end cap 12, four pins 13 and a second end cap, not shown, together form the frame of the motor 10. The stator lamination pack and the end caps are pushed on the pins 13 and are retained on the pins, for example by longitudinal ridges 14 on the said pins. The stator core 11 is provided with two windings 15, 16 being supported by a winding holder 17. Each winding in the usual manner being electrically insulated from the stator core by a winding insulation, has a leading end 15a, 16a, respectively, and a final end 15b and 16b, respectively. On the stator core are also mounted two terminal blocks 18, 19 consisting of insulating plastics material. For instance the blocks can be provided with pins which are pressed into holes in the stator lamination pack. The terminal block 18 has a groove 18a taking up and guiding the wire end 16a to a holder 20 for an interference suppressor 21. The suppressor has terminal pins 22, 23 to be connected to the mains and a pin 24 which is connected by a screw 25 to a projection 26 being part of the end cap 12 and forming an earth connection.The holder 20 is provided with a groove 27 for guiding the wire end 16a to the terminal 22. One of the walls defining the groove 27 has a curved part 28 forming a gentle change over between the groove 18a and the groove 27. The holder 20 also has a groove 29 for the guidance of the wire end 15a to the terminal pin 23. The terminal block 18 also has a terminal pin 30 to which the wire end 15b is connected. The pin is part of a contact spring 31 which extends upwards and contacts a brush holder 32. For the guidance of the wire end 15b the block 18 is provided with a groove 18b, the entrance part 18c of which having the form of a slit and being situated under a resilient tongue 33 of the terminal block. The tongue has gently rounded edges to facilitate insertion of the wire end 15b in the groove 18b. To further facilitate insertion of the said wire end the tongue 33 is positioned so as to form together with the winding 15 a V shaped entrance opening to the entrance part 18c of the groove 18b. The free end of the tongue is resiliently biassed against the winding 15 thereby preventing a wire end inserted in the entrance part 18c of the groove from loosening and taking an uncontrolled position.In order to facilitate the insertion of the wire end 16a in the groove 18a the terminal block 18 is provided with a lug 34, which together with the underlying part of the terminal block forms a V shaped groove 35 directed towards the groove 18a. The terminal block 19 has a design similar to that of the terminal block 18.Thus, a groove 19a is provided for the guidance of the wire end 16b to a terminal pin 36. The groove has an entrance part 19b having the shape of a slit and being situated under a resilient tongue 37. The grooves 18a, 18b, 19a, 19b, 27 and 29 have a width somewhat exceeding the greatest diameter of the wires used for the windings. For the wires of the windings to be well protected in the grooves the latter are cut to a depth exceeding the diameter of the wire by a factor of two.Any groove corresponding to the groove 18a in the terminal block 18 is not required in the block 19. As appears from Fig. 1 the terminal pin 36 forms part of a contact spring 38 which is resiliently biassed against a brush holder 39. In the manufacture of a motor of the kind described above the windings 15, 16 are machine wound directly on the stator core 11. After the completion of the windings the winding machine transfers the wire ends 15b and 16b to and inserts them in the V shaped grooves formed by the tongues 33 and 37 and the respective winding 15, 16. During the continued movement performed by the machine the said wire ends are guided downwards between the respective tongue, which yields, and the co operating winding, after which the wire ends are guided around the respective tongue and inserted in the entrance parts 18c, 19b of the grooves 18b and 19a. The wire end 16a is locked by the remaining winding turns and need not be further secured. This applies also to the wire end 15a.When the winding procedure is finished, the stator and the adherent terminal blocks are transferred to another automatic machine transferring the wire ends 15b, 16b via the respective groove 18b, 19a to the terminal pins 30, 36 to which the wire ends are secured by welding. Then, the holder 20 and the interference suppressor 21 are mounted, and the automatic machine transfers the wire end 16a via the groove 18 into the groove 27 and the wire end 15a directly into the groove 29.Then the wire ends 16a and 15a are drawn by the machine up to the pins 22, 23, to which the wire ends are connected by welding. Subsequently the motor is finished in a way known per se. In the manufacture of small electric rotating machines the invention provides a possibility of recognizing the different wire ends of the windings which later are to be connected to different terminal pins. Moreover, in assembling such machines it will be possible to make use of automatic mounting machines, which may also be used for transferring wire ends to terminals and for connecting said wire ends to the terminals.
