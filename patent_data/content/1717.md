## Description
Insecticidal Compositions Containing Tetraorganotin Compounds and Method for U8 This invention relates to compositions for controlling many varieties of insects which are harmful to agricultural and ornamental crops. The compositions contain an inert carrier and an effective amount of certain tetraorganotin compounds which exhibit excellent and unexpected activity when compared to closely related trimethyl tetraorganotin compounds. Also, the compounds exhibit reduced levels of phytotoxicity compared to other trimethyltin compounds disclosed in the prior art. The biological activity of compounds containing 3 hydrocarbon radicals bonded to a tin atom is well know. United States Patent Specification 3,264,177 discloses that tricyclohexyltin compounds effectively control arachnids, particularly spider mites however these compounds are generally ineffective as insecticides. The use of certain trialkyltin compounds, including bis trimethyltin oxide and trimethyltin chloride as insecticides is disclosed in United StatesPatent Specification 3,702,360. While these trialkyltin compounds effectively control insects, their high phytotoxicity makes them impractical for commercial use. Compounds containing 4 hydrocarbon groups bonded to a tin atom have for a long period of time been considered to possess, at best, only slight biological activity. In a text entitled Chemistry of Organotin Compounds R.C. Poller states that insecticidal activity is largely confined to compounds with three Sn C bonds. He further states that variations in the nature of the fourth group attached to tin do not produce any striking effects. Despite this general atatement a number of organotin compounds wherein the tin atom is bonded to three non substituted hydrocarbon groups and a fourth hydrocarbon group containing a functional group, which often contains sulphur, have been disclosed as being effective insecticides.Patent Specifications disclosing this type of organotin compound are discussed in detail hereinafter. It is an obJective of this invention to make use organotin compounds exhibiting insecticidal activity equivalent to other trimethyltin compounds disclosed in the prior art buth with redu oed levels of phytotoxicity, thereby making possible application of compositions containing these compounds to living plants. One aspect of the invention provides compositions for protecting plants against damage by killing insects on the plants, the compositions comprising an inert carrier and an insecticidally effective amount of at least one tetraorganotin compound chosen from the following compounds having the general formulae EMI3.1 wherein the O CH2 p O group is bonded to adjacent carbon atoms of the phenyl ring, m is 0 or 1, 2 is 1 or 2, R1 and R2 are individually selected from hydrogen, fluorine. chlorine. bromine. iodine. aryl. oR3. SR4.EMI3.2 and CsAN, wherein R is alkyl and contains from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, R4, R5 and R6 are individually selected from hydrogen and alkyl containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms with the proviso that R1 and R2 are not both hydrogen where m 0, Xs is an anion selected from chloride, bromide, iodide, bisulphate, acetate and methyl sulphate anions Y is an alkali metal cation or emmonwtam and Z is selected fromEMI4.1 wherein R7 is alkyl containing from 1 te 6 carbon atoms and Xi is as defined above and monoand bicyclic heterocyclic groups of an aromatic nature wherein the or each ring of the heterocyclic group contains 5 or 6 atoms including one or two heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur, the said heterocyclic groups being free of active hydrogen atoms. The active toxicant of the present insecticidal compositions are tetraorganotin compounds containing four carbon tin bonds, three of which are methyl groups. The fourth valency of the tin atom is satisfied by a benzyl, substituted phenyl or monovalent heterocyclic group of an aromatic nature that is either monocyclic or bicyclic. The heterocyclic group can be either bonded directly to the tin atom through a cyclic carbon atom or separated from the tin atom by a methylene group. The phenyl or benzyl group can contain one or two inert monovalent substituenis, represented by R1 and R2 in the preceding formulae.Alternatively, the subs tituent can be of the general formula 0 tCH2fO wherein the two oxygen atoms are bonded to adJacent cyclic carbon atoms of a phenyl or benzyl group and 2 is 1 or 2. The nature and degree of activity exhibited by a given compound is greatly influenced by the fourth group attached to the tin atom. Phenyl and hydrocarbyl substituted phenyltrim ethyl tin compounds such as phenyltrimethyltin, o tolytrimethyltin and E xylyltrimethyltin are relatively inactive against insects, as will be demonstrated by the data in the present specific description. The compounds used in this invention are structurally similar to these inactive compounds but show an unexpected insecticide activity which in many cases is equal to or greater than that shown by certain commercial insecticides that are used as standards by those skilled in the art. United States Patent Specification 3,988,145 discloses organotin compounds of the general formula A S02 CH2SnR3 wherein A is alkyl of from 1 to 14 carbon atoms, aryl, substituted aryl1 or R2N, wherein R is alkyl of from 7 to 14 carbon atoms and each R1 is alkyl of from 1 to 14 carbon atoms, or aryl. United States Patent Specification 3,987,191 discloses organosulphtnylmethyl triorganotin compounds of the general formula R SO C A SnR1 wherein R is alkyl of from 1 to 14 carbon atoms, aryl or a substituted aryl group and each R1 is an alkyl group of 1 to 10 carbon atoms. The compounds in the aforementioned U.S. Patent Specifications allegedly exhibit insecticidal and acaricidal properties. The compounds used in the present invention differ from compounds disclosed in U.S. PatentSpecifications 3,988,145 and 3,987,191 in that the aryl or heterocyclic ring is bonded directly to the tin atom or is separated by only one methylene radical. No heteroatom is present in the linkage between the tin atom and the aryl or heterocyclic radical. United States Patent Specification 3,976,672 claims hydrocarbylphenylsulphonyl alkyltrimethyl stannanes of the general formulaEMI6.1 wherein each R1 is the same or different and is a linear or branched alkyl of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, a cycloaliphatic radical having 4 to 6 carbon atoms or linear or branched alkyl having 2 to 20 carbon atoms, m is an integer from 1 to 3 and n is an integer from 2 to 11. Once again, the phenyl group is isolated from the tin atom by a sulphur atom. In addition, data in the present specific description demonstrate that compounds wherein the substituent on the phenyl group is alkyl are rdatively ineffective insecticides.The compounds used in this invention differ from the compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent Specification 3,986,672 in two important respects. A minimum of two methylene groups and a sulphur dioxide group are not required between the tin atom and the aryl group and the substitution on the aryl group is not an alkyl or other hydrocarbon radical. Furthermore, the compounds disclosed in this U.S. Patent Specification are prepared using trimethyltin hydride, a volatile, unstable and highly toxic compound as one of the starting materials. This reagent is not normally employed to prepare the present compounds. Certain of the present tetraorganotin compounds containing a substituted phenyl or a benzyl group bonded to the tin atom are conveniently prepared by reacting the corresponding phenyl or benzyl magnesium halide with trimethyltin chloride. The reaction of arylmagnesium compounds with stannic halides or organotin halides is well known and does not constitute any part of the present invention. Alternatively the compounds can be prepared by reacting trimethyltin lithium or trimethyltin sodium with a halobenzene or an a haiotoluene. Those tetraorganotin compounds wherein Z in the foregoing general formula III represents a heterocyclic radical can be prepared by reacting the corresponding heterocyclic halide, such as 2 bromopyridine, with an alkyllithium compound and trimethyltin chloride.Alternatively, trimethyltin lithium or trimethyltin sodium is reacted with th heterocyclic halide. The accompanying examples contain detailed procedures for preparing both of the foregoing types of compounds. The radical Z in the generic formula III for the present tetraorganotin compounds represents an aromatic monocyclic or bicyclic residue wherein each ring contains 5 or 6 atoms, at least one of which is a nitrogen, sulphur or oxygen atom. Suitable heterocyclic precursors for preparing this dass of compounds can be represented by the general formulaZ X wherein X is a halogen atom, preferably chlorine or bromine, that is bonded to a carbon atom. When the heterocyclic group represented by Z contains a nitrogen atom, the nitrogen cannot be bonded directly to a hydrogen atom, nor can Z contain any other labile hydrogen atoms. The reason for these requirements is that the labile hydrogen atom may react with the tincontaining reagent used to prepare the final product, a resulting in formation of tin nitrogen bond or a stannic hydride.The use of these classes of compounds are not within the scope of the present invention. Wen only two of the three valencies of a nitrogen atom are satisfied by bonds to cyclic atoms of the Z group the remaining valency is preferably satisfied by a hydrocarbyl group such as alkyl. Suitable aromatic heterocyclic precursors include halogen containing N hydrocarbyl pyrroles, 3,3 dihydrocarbyl isopyrroles, N hydrocarbyl pyrazoles, 2, 2 dihydrocarbyl I , 3 isodiazoles and triazoles, isoxazole, oxazole, thiazole, isothiazole, oxadiazole, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, the isomeric halogen containing triazines, halogenated benzofuran, benzothiofuran, N hydrocarbyl insoles, benzoxazole, quinoline and isoquinoline. While the exact nature of the hydrocarbon substituents specified for some of the foregoing heterocyclic compounds is not critical, lower alkyl containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms is preferred. The Z group may contain one or more substituents such as hydrocarbyl, halogen, alkoxy,N,N dialkylamino and alkylthio in addition to the halogen atom which reacts with a tin containing precursor to form the present compounds. Specific examples of preferred compounds which are useful as insecticides include trimethyl 2 ppridyltin, trim ethyl 3, 4 methyl enedioxyphenyl tin, trimethyl 2 furyltin, trimethyl prmethoxyphenyltin, trim ethyl 2 thi enyltin, trimethyl aminophenyl tin, trfmetbyl p N,N diethylaminophenyltin, trimethyl p chlorophenyl tin, trimethylbenzyltin, trim ethyl S pyrimidyltin and the methiodide thereof, trimethyl 3pyridyltin and the methiodide thereof, trimethyl E carbethoxyphenyltin, trimethyl Ercyanophenyltin, trimethyl 2 chlorobenzyltin, trimethyl methylbenzyltin, trimethyl 2 thienylmethyltin, trimethyl 2 naphthylmethyl tin, trimethyl grbiphenylmethyltin, trimethyl N , N diethylaminophenyl tin methiodide and trimethyl 4 potassiocarboxyphenyltin. The present tetraorganotin compounds exhibit significantly reduced levels of phytotoxicity relative to trimethyltin compounds such as trimethyltin chloride and trimethyltin acetate and effectively control insects on all types of agricultral and ornamental crops. Amongst the insecticidally effective compounds which can be used are those having the general formulae IV , V , VI and VII EMI10.1 wherein the O CH2 p O group is bonded to adjacent carbon atoms of the phenyl ring, m is O or 1, 2 is 7 or 2, R10 is selected from CO2 Y , CO2R40, SO2R50, SO2R50, SO3 Y , PO OR OR60 and PO R50 R60 R20 and R30 are individually selected from hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine,EMI11.1 the proviso that 20 and R30 cannot both be hydrogen R40 is alkyl and contains from 1 to 12 carbon atoms R50 R60 and R70 are individually selected from hydrogen and alkyl containing from 7 to 12 carbon atoms X is an anion selected from chloride, bromide, iodide, bisulphate, acetate and methyl sulphate anions Y is an alkali metal cation or ammonium andZ is selected fromEMI11.2 wherein R80 is alkyl containing from I to 60 carbon atoms and X is as defined above and mono and bicyclic unsaturated heterocyclic groups of an aromatic nature wherein the or each ring of the heterocyclic group contains 5 or 6 atoms including one or two heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur with the proviso that Z is not pyridyl, furyl or thienyl when m is 0 and that the heterocyclic group is active hydrogen free. The compounds of the general formulae iv VII are novel compounds and are disclosed in theSpecification of our co pending Application 78 . The term active hydrogen refers to a hydrogen atom bonded to nitrogen or other atom of the heterocyclic group which makes the hydrogen atom reactive towards organometallic compounds such as organolithium and organosodium compounds. Such novel compounds are embraced by the compounds of the general formulae I , II and III for use in the present invention.Examples of preferred novel compounds for use in the present invention are the following compounds EMI12.1 compounds wherein R10 isEMI12.2 e.g. wherein Yis an alkali metal, andEMI12.3 For use as insecticides, the organotin compounds used in this invention are preferably incorporated into compositions which comprise an inert carrier and one or more of the organotin compounds. As used herein an inert carrier is defined as a solvent or dispersing agent or a dry bulking agent which has substantially no insecticidal effectiveness but which provides a means whereby the organotin compounds can be diluted for convenient application . Such inse Oicidal compositions enable the organotin compounds to be applied in a convenient and controlled manner to plants in any desired quantity.These compositions can be solids, such as dusts, or granules or wettable powders, or they can be liquids such as solutions, aerosols, or emulsions.For application to plants the compositions generally contain from about 2 to 80 of the organotin compound s depending on a number of factors including physical properties and mammalian toxicity of the compound s .The concentration of organotin compound s in a final spray mixture, for instance, will be generally in a range from about 1 to 1,000 pom warts per million , preferably from about 10 to 500 ppm. Generally, whatever application technique is used, the amount of organotin compound s applied should be of the order of from about 0.01 to about 3.0 pounds, preferably from about 0.1 to about 1.0 pound per acre of crop, depending on type of crop, foliage density and the severity of the infestation. For convenience in bulk handling, the compositions are generally formulated as concentrates which can be diluted to the desired usage level with water, organic solvent or other inert carrier just prior to use. Dusts can be prepared by blending the organotin compounds with a solid inert carrier such as talos, clay , silicas, pyrophylite and the like. Granular formulations can be prepared by impregnating the organotin compounds, usually dissolved in a suitable solvent, onto and into graeulzted carriers such as the attapulgites or the vermiculites, usually of a particle size range of from about 0.3 to 1.5 mm, or by coating a solid inert carrier with a wettable powder formulation of the compounds. Wettable powders, which can be dispersed in water or oil to any desired concentration of the organotin compounds, can be prepared by incorporating wetting agents into concentrated dust compositions. The organotin compounds used in the present invention are sufficiently soluble or dispersible in the common organic solvents such as kerosene, xylene,Stoddard Solvent, acetone, and the like, that they can be used directly as solutions or dispersions in these solvent a. Frequently these solutions or dispersions are dispensed under super atnospheric pressure as aerosols. Preferred liquid insecticidal compositions for the practice of the invention herein are emulsifiable concentrates which comprise the organotin compound s , an emulsifier, and, as an inert carrier, a solvent. Such concentrates can be extended with water and or oil to the desired concentration of organotin compound s for application as sprays to the plants which are to be treated.The emulsifiers used in these concentrates are surface active agents of the anionic, nonionic, cationic, ampholytic or zwitterionic type and normally comprise from about 0.1 5o to 30 by weight of the concentrate. The emulsifiers can be used singly or in mixtures. Examples of suitable anionic surface active agents are alkali metal and alkaline earth metal e.g., sodium and calcium salts of fatty alcohol aulphates having from 8 18 carbon atoms in the fatty chain and the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal e.g., sodium and calcium salts of alkyl benzene sulphonates, having from 9 to 15 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain.Examples of suitable nonionic surface active agents are the polyethylene oxide condensates of fatty alcohols, whenln the fatty chain contains from about 8 to 22 carbon atoms and the amount of ethylene oxide condensed onto each mole of fatty alcohol is from about 5 to 25 moles. Examples of suitable cationic surface active agents are dimethyl dialkyl quaternary ammonium salts wherein the alkyl chains contain from about 8 to 18 carbon atoms and the salt forming anion is a halogen. Examples of suitable ampholytic surface active agents are derivatives of aliphatic secondary or tertiary amines in which one of the aliphatic substituents contains from about 8 to 18 carbon atoms and one contains an anionic water solubilizing group, e.g., sulphate, sulphonate or carboxylate.Specific suitable ampholytic surface active agents are sodium 3 dodeULamino propionate and sodium 3 dodecylamlno propane sulphonate. Examples of suitable Zwitterionic surface active agents are derivatives of aliphatic quaternary ammonium compounds in which one of the aliphatic constituents contains from about 8 to 18 carbon atoms and one contains an anionic water solubilizing group. Specific examples of Zwitterionic surface active agents are 3 N,N dimethyl N hexadecylamm.nio propane I sulphonate and 3 N,N dimethyl N hexadecylammonio 2 hydroxy propane l sulphonate. Many other suitable surface active agents are described in McCutchens Detergents and Emulsifiers 1972 Ed., Allured Pub. Co.,Ridgewood, N.J., which is incorporated by reference herein. Suitable solvents for these emulsifiable concentrates include hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, kerosene and Stoddard Solvent and halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloro benz ene, chloroform, fluoro trichlorom ethane and dichlorodiflioro methane. Solvents can be used singly or in mixtures. The following preparations describe the preparation of representative compounds employable in the present invention and in the followingProcedures I 5 and the Exanple demonstrate the the efficacy of these compounds as insecticides which can be applied to living plants. All parts and perc entages are by weight unless otherwise specified.PREPARATION 1. Preparation of Trimethyl 3, 4 methylene dioxyphenyltin.

A number of representative compounds were evaluated to determine their efficacy as control agents for the beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua , tobacco budworm Heliothis virescens , larvae of the codling moth Laspeyresia pomonella , western spotted cucumber beetle Diabrotica undecimpunctata and peach aphid Myzus persicae . The compounds evaluated were applied to plants in the form of aqueous dispersions containing the desired concentration of organotin compound. Solid compounds were combined with a small amount of a wettable powder to form a concentrate, which was subsequently diluted to the final concentration with water containing 0.5 of a commercial anionic surfactant. Liquid compounds were dissolved in a small amount of acetone and the resultant concentrate was brought to the final dilution using water containing 0.546 of the aforementioned anionic surfactant. The following procedures were employed to evaluate the efficacy of representative compounds as control agents for the aforementioned insects. Procedure 1 Beet Armvworm. A cotton plant was grown until it developed two fully expanded leaves. The plant was then dipped into an aqueous dispersion of the test compound and allowed to dry for 30 minutes. The two fully oxpanded leaves were then removed and placed in petri dishes. Five third instar larvae of the beet armyworm were placed in each dish. The dishes were stored for six days in a chamber maintained at a temperature of 26 270C and a relative humidity of 80 , at the end of which time a mortality count was taken. Procedure 2 Tobacco Budworm Stomach and Contact Test . Newly developed tobacco leaves were treated as described for the cottom plants in Procedure 1. A section of the leaf was then placed in a petri dish.Larvae of the tobacco budworm were placed on the treated leaves, which were then stored for two days at 26 270C and 80 relative humidity, at the end of which time a mortality count was taken. Procedure 3 Codlinr Moth Larvae. An aqueous dispersion of the test chmical was applied to apples or pears, which were then covered with eggs of the codling moth. The eggs had previously been dipped in the same aqueous dispersion applied to the flit. The fruit was then incubated from eight to ten days in a greenhouse, at which time the percentage of living larvae was determined and compared with the results from a sample of untreated fruit used as a control. Procedure 4 Western SPotted Cucumber Beetle Larvae. Seventy five grams of air dried soil were placed in a 236 cc capacity round bottle and treated with sufficient volume of a solution containing 400 ppm of the chemical to give 25 ppm of toxicant on an air dried soil basis. The treated soil, after being allowed to air dry, was mixed by shaking and rolling. Eggs of the western spotted cucumber beetle laid over a period of 3 or 4 days were collected and a measured quantity of eggs were suspended in water.The egg concentration was 70 80 eggs 0.5 ce of solution.A portion of the suspension containing about 50 eggs was pipetted into the bottom of a clear plastics medicinal vial. An amount of treated 8oil sufficient to cover the eggs was added, a corn seed was placed on the soil and covered with additional treated soil. The soil, eggs and seed mix was watered and additional water added as necessary to maintain growth of the seedling corn plant. Care wan taken not to add excess water sufficient to drown the larvae. After a period of from 6 9 days an observation was made to determine the presence of larvae both on top of the soil and at the roots of the seedling. Procedure 5 Peach APhid, Cotton plants were grown singly in small aquare pots. Before the leaves were fully expanded the plant was infested by placing the leaves in contact with leaves from plants which had previously been ia infested with peach aphids. An aqueous dispersion of the test chaical was then injected into the root zone of the infested plants, and the plants were kept in a green house for from three to six days following treatment with the test compound, at . which time a mortality count was made. A number of the preferred tetraorganotin compounds were evaluated as insecticides using the foregoing procedures. The results of these evaluations are summarized in the following tables. The efficacy of the compounds listed in the first six tables is expressed using the term LCx which represents the concentration in parts per million ppm that was lethal to a specified percentage of the population, indicated by x . All initial screening of the compounds was done at a concentration of 400 ppm except for the western spotted cucumber beetle, in which instance the concentration was 25 ppm.
