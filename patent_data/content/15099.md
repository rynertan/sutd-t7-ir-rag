# Catalyst and process for producing olefin polymers or copolymers.

## Abstract
A catalyst for use in producing olefin polymers or copolymers comprising A a solid titanium catalyst compo nent having magnesium, halogen, titanium, phosphorus and a carboxylic acid ester and B an organometallic compound of a metal of Groups I to III of Mendelejeff s periodic table provides improved results, in that stereoregular products can be obtained over a wide range of melt flow indices, when the solid titanium catalyst component A is one in which the molar ratio of the phosphorus to the carboxylic acid ester is from 0.05 1 to 2 1 and which has a specific surface area of not less than 40 mÂ² g, and also contains C an electron donor. The catalyst can be used to produce an olefin polymer or copolymer by polymerizing an alpha olefin having at least 3 carbon atoms or copolymerizing at least two such alpha olefins or such an alpha olefin with up to 20 mole of ethylene and or a diene.
