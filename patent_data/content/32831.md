# DEVICE FOR DISPENSING PRE DETERMINED MEASURE OF A BEVERAGE AND APPARATUS FOR MONITORING DISPENSING OF PRE DETERMINED MEASURES OF BEVERAGES

## Abstract
A wine or spirits dispensing device or optic is pro vided with signal generating means, for example a spaced infra red emitting diode 28 and phototransistor with an interrupter 25 , movable by the valve mechanism 11 . A signal is thus generated every time a measure of wine or spirits is dispensed, thus enabling a count to be kept. Preferably the air vent valve 18 , which admits air to the measuring chamber 10 to allow liquid to flow out into a drinking glass beneath the device, is used to operate the signal generating means. A second signal may be gener ated by breaking electrical connections when removing the device from a support stand, thus enabling the number of bottles used to be counted. The invention also provides apparatus comprising a central counting unit with memories and a plurality of si gnal generating devices associated with optics and or beer metering pumps.
