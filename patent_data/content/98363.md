# Gas turbine with blade temperature control.

## Abstract
A gas turbine in which hot gas is directed only over a portion or preselected number of the turbine blades and means are provided for directing a flow of a cooling gas over another portion or different preselected number of blades. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the means for providing cooling gas comprises a compressor means lo cated adjacent the turbine. Preferably the gas turbine com prises a pluarality of alternating compressor means and turbine stages wherein the direction of flow of cooling gas is countercurrent to that of the hot gas flowing through the turbine stages.
