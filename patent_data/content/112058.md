# A method of and apparatus for forming a polymeric sheet structure having comparatively high density skin layers and a comparatively low density core layer.

## Abstract
In a method and apparatus for producing a foamed polymeric sheet having comparatively high density skin layers and a comparatively low density core layer, molten polymer containing a foaming agent is extruded from a die 18 into a post extrusion region 22 defined by the die 18 and a spaced pair of rotating chill rolls 24 which are spaced from the die 18. The post extrusion region 22 is maintained at a pressure sufficient to at least inhibit expansion of the foaming agent through the use of cooled sealing elements 26 which occupy a substantial portion of the space between the die 18 and the chill rolls 24, and are spaced from the chill rolls 24. The rolls 24 and the sealing elements 26 are cooled so that molten polymer in the space between the sealing elements and the rolls becomes solidified, completing the seal. The chill rolls 24 are maintained at a temperature below the temperature of the molten polymer to aid the skin formation on the surfaces of the polymer. If desired, the polymer can pass directly from the chill rolls into a water bath.
