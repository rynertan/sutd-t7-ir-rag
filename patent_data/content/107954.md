# Hydraulic fluid containers and reservoirs.

## Abstract
A hydraulic fluid container 10, 110 is specially adapted to mate with a vehicle hydraulic fluid reservoir 40, 160 for the purpose of transferring fluid from the container to the reservoir. In one embodiment a spout 24 has a particular cross section which matches the opening 46 in the reservoir. In another embodiment a valve 148, 150, 216, 218, 316, 318, 416, 418 in the container or reservoir is opened by a probe 164, 232, 332 in the other of the container and reservoir when the container and reservoir are mated together. The invention prevents fluid from a container not specially adapted to the reservoir being added to reservoir.
