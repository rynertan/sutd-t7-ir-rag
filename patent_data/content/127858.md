# Flip flop having improved synchronous reset.

## Abstract
A flip flop is provided having a data gate circuit means 1 for receiving input data and generating therefrom first and second complementary internal data signals representative of the input data. A master circuit means 2 is coupled to the data gate circuit means for receiving a clock pulse and for latching the internal data signals during a predetermined por tion of the clock pulse. A slave circuit means 3 is coupled to the master circuit means for storing the internal data signals. A reset means 23 supplies a synchronous reset signal to the master circuit means for resetting the first and second com plementary internal data signals on the occurrence of the next clock pulse.
