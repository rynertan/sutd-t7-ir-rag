# Laser recording apparatus.

## Abstract
A laser recording apparatus has an image control circuit which allows for vertical or horizontal straight lines to be printed in spaces between lines without increasing the capacity of the memory region of the memory means of the apparatus. The image control circuit includes memory 6 for storing character data, character patterning circuitry 9 for converting the character data into character patterns which have memory regions 71 74 for storing character data, control circuitry 11 for reading character data stored in the peripheral portions of the memory regions 71 74 to read such character data as straight lines in the spaces between character patterns and a central processing unit 4 to control the various circuitry.
