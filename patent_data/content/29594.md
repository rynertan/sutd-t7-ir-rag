## Description
TITLE A Liquid Acrylic Coating Composition,Articles Coated therewith and Process for Preparing said Coated Articles . BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to coating compositions.In particular, it is directed toward thermosetting acrylic enamels containing ultraviolet light stabilizers, which enamels give a high quality weather resistant coating, especially useful for coating the exterior of automobile and truck bodies. The enamels are prepared as disclosed in Parker United States Patent 3,637,546 issued January 25, 1972. The addition of one or more ultraviolet light stabilizers serves to diminish the degradation effects of the ultraviolet radiation in the sunlight. Optionally, the enamels also contain one or more antioxidants. Sunlight is composed of electromagnetic radiation with energy in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet portions of the spectrum. When the ultraviolet portion of sunlight falls upon a clear surface coating, the energy may be partially or wholly absorbed by the coating. In many instances, the energy absorbed initiates a photochemical reaction which causes discoloration and or physical failure of the coating. Pigmented surface coatings also suffer from ultraviolet degradation.The inclusion of an ultraviolet light stabilizer can increase the useful life of both clear and pigmented coatings. Ultraviolet light stabilizers protect the coatings by absorbing the destructive, high energy ultraviolet rays and converting such energy into nondestructive heat energy. Antioxidants are useful in preventing the oxidation of polymers, or for inhibiting oxidation already begun by oxygen, air, ozone, or oxidizing agents of many types. The rate of thermal oxidation of the polymeric systems used in coating compositions is normally rather slow, i.e., a reaction that occurs over weeks, months, or years under ordinary conditions.However, even though the reaction is often slow, pronounced effects may be readily observable very early in the degradation reaction. Furthermore, more rapid oxidative degradation occurs in the presence of ultraviolet radiant energy. Antioxidants can assist ultraviolet light stabilizers in effectively retarding this degradation. Thermosetting acrylic enamel finishes are widely used on the exterior of automobiles and trucks.It has been found that an excellent appearance along with depth of color and metallic glamour can be obtained by applying a clear or transparent coat over the conventional colored or pigmented coat. However, the weatherability and durability of these clear coats have been found to be poor. Checking, cracking, and flaking of the clear coat occur after relatively short periods of exposure to outdoor weathering, giving the automobile or truck an unsightly appearance. Refinishing of these weathered clear coats is difficult and expensiveasince the clear coat must be sanded to remove cracked and flaked clear coat before a refinish coat can be applied. In an effort to retard or substantially reduce checking, cracking and flaking of the clear coat, conventional ultraviolet light stabilizers have been added to the clear coat. Also, the combination of a transparent pigment and an ultraviolet light screener has been added to the clear coat, as suggested byLaBerge United States Patent 3,407,156 issued October 22, 1968. In each of the above cases, the durability and weatherability of the clear coat was increased for a relatively small length of time but not to the extent required for a practical automotive or truck finish.There exists a felt need for acrylic enamels effectively stabilized against ultraviolet radiation for use in a clear coat color coat system. Ultraviolet light stabilizers have traditionally been used only in those coating compositions which are utilized as topcoats. The problem with this procedure has been the tendency of the stabilizers to leach out of the topcoat and escape into the atmosphere, leaving the topcoat susceptible to weathering. The composition of this invention, containing ultraviolet light stabilizer and, optionally, antioxidant, has a preferred utility of being used as a clear coat color coat finish and particularly as the color coat of such a finish. It is theorized that the ultraviolet light stabilizer will migrate from the color coat into the clear coat, thereby protedting the clear coat against weathering. The preferred finish is one in which both the clear coat and the color coat contain as additives one or more ultraviolet light stabilizers and one or more antioxidants. Some of the additives will be consumed from the clear surface through leaching, evaporation, and photochemical reaction. The high concentration of additives in the color coat will serve as a reservoir and replenish the lost additives through diffusion from the color coat to the clear coat. Thermosetting acrylic enamels prepared according to the teachings of Parker United States Patent 3,637,546 are characterized by increased freedom from water spotting and have excellent craze resistance in combination with outstanding durability and gloss retention. The Parker enamels are resistant to aromatic solvents and are particularly resistant to gasoline. They show improved adhesion to metal substrates when compared with conventional acrylic enamels. While theParker enamels are cross linking enamels, they can be spot repaired using the same technique as is used to repair lacquer coatings, i.e., a solvent mist is applied to soften the damaged coating, and the repair coating is applied and then baked to a hard, glossy finish which has the appearance of a lacquer coating.Moreover, these enamels can be applied at substantially higher spray solids than conventional lacquers. Because the enamels provide a thicker film per application, only one to two coats need be applied whereas conventional lacquers require several coats to achieve a comparable film thickness. For the foregoing reasons, the Parker thermosetting acrylic enamels are extremely useful as automotive coating compositions. The novel compositions of this invention, consisting essentially of the Parker enamels, ultraviolet light stabilizers, and, optionally, antioxidants, are even more useful, particularly when utilized in clear coat color coat finishes as described. SU Y OF THE INV NTION Thermosetting acrylic enamels are prepared according to the teachings of Parker United StatesPatent 3,637,546. The enamel may be either clear or pigmented, depending upon its intended use. These enamels contain about 1 208 by weight, based on the weight of the film forming constituents,of ultraviolet light stabilizer. Optionally, they also contain about 0.1 5 by weight of antioxidant, wherein the weiaht ratio of ultraviolet light stabilizer to antioxidant is about 1 1 to about 50 1. Preferably, about 5 85 by weight of ultraviolet light stabilizer is used, optionally with about 0.1 1 by weight of antioxidant, wherein the weight ratio of ultraviolet light stabilizer to antioxidant is about 10 1.The specified percentages of ultraviolet light stabilizer or antioxidant may be obtained by combining two or more ultraviolet light stabilizers or two or more antioxidants as well as by utilizing such additives singularly.

Examples of the great variety of pigments which are used in the novel coating composition of this invention are metallic oxides preferably titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and the like ,metal hydroxides, metal flakes, metal powders, chromates such as lead chromate , sulfides, sulfates, carbonates, carbon black, silica, talc, china clay, iron blues, organic reds, maroons, organic dyes, lakes, and the like. If the enamel is to be employed as a clear coat, it may contain one or more transparent pigments, i.e., pigments having the same or similar refractive index as the binder of the clear coat with a small particle size of about 0.01550 microns.

Up to about 16 by weight of iron pyrophosphate and up to about 15 by weight of silica, based on the weight of the film forming constituents, can be used. The addition of iron pyrophosphate and silica will improve the overall durability and performance of the finish. Although applicant does not wish to be bound by the following theory, it is believed that iron pyrophosphate creates a synergistic effect with ultraviolet light stabilizers and antioxidants, yielding a period of outdoor weatherability surpassing that which would cumulatively be expected from a combination of the three types of additives. Thermosetting acrylic enamels prepared in the manner described and containing about 1 20 by weight, and preferably about 5 8 by weight, based on the weight of the film forming constituents, of ultraviolet light stabilizer prove particularly useful in clear coat color coat finishes. Such enamels may also contain about 0.1 5 by weight, and preferably about 0.1 1 by weight, of antioxidant. Where an antioxidant is used, the weight ratio of ultraviolet light stabilizer to antioxidant ranges from about 1 1 to about 50 1 and is preferably about 10 1. The novel coating compositions of this invention can be applied to a variety of substrates, e.g., metal, wood, glass, and plastics such as polypropylene, styrene, and copolymers of styrene, by any of the usual application methods, e.g., spraying, electrostatic spraying, dipping, brushing, flow coating, and the like. Preferably, the coating composition is applied over a suitably primed metal substrate. These coatings can be air dried or can be baked to minimize the drying period. The resulting coating is about 1 5 mils thick, preferably 1 3 mils thick, and can be rubbed or polished in accordance with conven tional.techniques, if desired, to improve smoothness or apparent gloss or both. After the novel coating composition is applied, the coating preferably is cured at about 125 175eC. for about 15 30 minutes. By the addition of conventional catalyst to the novel composition, the curing temperature can be reduced to 80 1100C. Typical catalysts that can be used are butyl acid phosphate, paratoluene sulfonic acidland the like.

The results are as follows EXPOSURE DATA Gloss Measured At 200Time Exposure hrs. 0 167 330 659 988 1153 1480 1462 1855Clear Coat C 82 84 89 83 82 75 39 Failed Paint C control Clear Coat D 81 82 88 88 82 87 84 87 91Paint CClear Coat E 86 86 89 90 93 92 88 94 98Paint EClear Coat C 87 87 88 89 91 91 84 93 95Paint FClear Coat G 84 86 87 89 89 91 86 93 94Paint G EXPOSURE DATA, Cont.Time Exposure hrs. 2044 2328 3011 3222 3900 4500 5300Clear Coat C F A I L .

The panel having a finish of Clear Coat D, which contained a relatively large quantity of ultraviolet light stabilizer, and Paint C, which did not contain ultraviolet light stabilizer or antioxidant, checked at 4500 hours however, the finish was unacceptable for color and softness of the clear coat. The other panels had an acceptable appearance and hardness.The panel having a finish of Clear Coat E and Paint E, in which both the clear coat and the color coat contained ultraviolet light stabilizer, checked at 4500 hours. The panel having a finish of a Clear Coat C with no ultraviolet light stabilizer and Paint F with a large amount of ultraviolet light stabilizer checked at 3900 hours and failed after 4500 hours. The panel having a finish of a Clear Coat G and Paint G, the only panel containing both ultraviolet light stabilizer and antioxidant, checked at 3900 hours and failed at 4500 hours. From these results, it can be expected that clear coat color coat finishes that contain ultraviolet light stabilizers alone or in combination with antioxidants can be expected to have a substantially longer period of outdoor durability than those same finishes without ultraviolet light stabilizer. It appears from these results that it is the ultraviolet light stabilizer, and not the antioxidant, that contributes significantly to improved weatherability. It should be noted that the ultraviolet light stabilizer need not be in the clear coat to be effective, but can be in the color coat only, as shown by the panel having a finish of ClearCoat C and Paint F, since the ultraviolet lightstabilizer will migrate from the color coat into the clear coat.
