## Description
DESCRIPTION NITROIMIDAZOLE COMPOUNDS AKD CAMPOSITIONS USEFUL IN THE TREATMENT OF ACNE This invention relates to the compounds and compositions useful in the treatment of acne. Acne is a disfiguring and frequently embarrassing condition which affects certain areas of the skin which are rich in sebaceous glands, especially the face, neck and back. It occurs most frequently in adolescents. While the precise cause of acne is not fully understood, it results from an abnormality of the sebaceous glands and blockage of the pilosebaceous ducts owing to a combination of factors. These include hyperkeratosis of the follicular duct, an increase in the amount and change in the composition of the sebum, and the colonisation of the sebaceous follicles by bacteria, especially Propionibacterium or Corynebacterium acnes. These effects produce the characteristic acne lesions, chiefly comedones, papules and pustules together with generalised inflammation.A variety of therapeutic treatments for acne are currently in use, and these are based in the main on keratolytics which reduce the hyperkeratinisation or on antibiotics which minimise the effects of the bacterial infection. One method of treatment which has attracted considerable interest in recent years is the use of retinoic acid Vitamin A acid applied topically to the lesions. Retinoic acid has a very marked keratolytic effect on the epidermis and a proportion of acne patients benefit from its use. It causes peeling of the skin and unblocks the pilosebaceous ducts. However, since retinoic acid is highly irritant, some patients do not benefit from its use and may indeed suffer undesirable side effects. It has also been proposed to treat acne by oral antibiotic therapy using, in particular, tetracyclines. It is believed that where this treatment is successful, it is the action of the antibiotic on harmful bacterial metabolites which is responsible for the beneficial effect. Another method of treatment of some interest involves the topical application of ethyl lactate to the affected area. The bacterial esterases in the sebaceous ducts hydrolyse the ethyl lactate with liberation of lactic acid which suppresses the growth of the bacteria. Thus the bacterial are themselves responsible for producing the hydrolysis of the ethyl lactate which prevents their further growth. The present invention provides novel compounds and compositions for use in the treatment of acne. ThePropionibacterium acnes present in the sebaceous glands in acne are predominantly anaerobic which explains why tetracyclines do not actually destroy them directly.Two agents which are known to be highly effective against anaerobic bacteria are the nitroimidazoles, metronidazole and mizonidazole. However, these compounds have poor solubility in lipids and cannot therefore be applied directly to skin with any expectation that they will reach the interior of the sebaceous glands populated by the bacteria. The present invention provides nitroimidazole derivatives and compositions which are effective in the treatment of acne. The invention provides, as new compounds useful in the treatment of acne, the nitroimidazole derivatives of the formula EMI3.1 where the nitro group is in the 4 or 5 position of the imidazole ring. These compounds are the retinoates of metronidazole the 5 nitro compound and mizonidazole the 4 nitro compound . These compounds are lipid soluble and when applied topically to an area of skin affected by acne, penetrate well into the epidermis. When the compounds reach the sebaceous glands, they are hydrolysed by the bacterial esterases present, thus liberating both the nitroimadazole itself which is then effective against those anaerobic bacteria, and retinoic acid, which exerts its beneficial keratolytic effect on the hyperkeratotic lining of the pilosebaceous duct and the keratin anchoring the comedones.Consequently, by esterifying the nitroimidazole derivative with retinoic acid, the beneficial effects of both are secured in the place, namely the interior of the pilosebaceous duct, where they are required. Alternatively, according to a further feature of the invention, a similar effect can be secured by applying to the skin affected by acne a pharmaceutical composition comprising retinoic acid or a lower alkyl ester thereof and a nitroimidazole ester of the formula EMI4.1 in which R is an aliphatic residue such that RCOOH is an aliphatic carboxylic acid of 3 to 10 carbon atoms.However R should be substantially free of groups which would make the ester insoluble in lipids. Thus groups normally associated with water solubility, e.g. hydroxyl and carboxyl, are not desirable. Conveniently R is a residue of an alkanecarboxylic acid of 3 to 10 carbon atoms, e.g. propionic acid, butyric acid or valeric acid. When such a composition is applied to skin affected by acne, the retinoic acid penetrates to the pilosebaceous ducts with the nitroimidazole ester, and the latter is hydrolysed in situ by the esterases present.The desirable effect of retinoic acid and the nitroimidazole itself are thus secured in the affected areas. Of course, if a retinoic acid ester is used, such an ester is also hydrolysed in the vicinity of the sebaceous gland with liberation of free retinoic acid. The aforesaid retinoate of nitroimidazole may be made by reaction of metronidazole or mizonidazole with retinoic acid chloride, prepared in situ, e.g. by the action of thionyl chloride on retinoic acid in an inert solvent in the presence of a base. For example, the nitroimidazole may be reacted with the acid chloride in solution in tetrahydrofuran, in the presence of an organic base soluble in the reaction mixture such as pyridine.This process is illustrated by the following Example. EXAMPLE Metronidazole Retinoate 2 Nethyl 5 Nitroimidazole l Ethanol Retinoate To a solution of retinoic acid 5 g and pyridine 1.6 g , in dry tetrahydrofuran 50 ml , thionyl chloride 2.1 g in tetrahydrofuran 5 ml was added at 0 C ooh, over 15 minutes, under nitrogen, with stirring. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour and then filtered. The filtrate was added over 10 minutes at 350C to a solution of 2 methyl 5 nitroimidazole l ethanol 3 g , 4 dimethy laminopyridine 0.1 g , and pyridine 1.5 g in dry tetrahydrofuran 9anl . The mixture was stirred under reflux for 8 hours. Apportion of the tetrahydrofuran ca 60 ml was then distilled off and the residue stirred under reflux for a further 8 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered and the solvent evaporated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in chloroform loO ml and the solution washed with 2N sulphuric acid 2 x 50 ml , water 50 ml , lCYo aqueous sodium bicarbonate 50 ml , and water 50 ml . The chloroform solution was then dried over sodium sulphate and evaporated in vacuo.The residue was purified by multi funnel liquid liquid extraction between light petroleum spirit b.p. 40 60 C. and 95 aqueous methanol to yield 2 methyl 5 nitroimidazole l ethanol retinoate as an orange yellow gum 6 g which solidifies on cooling The purity was shown by TLC silica gel plates ethyl acetate light petroleum 1 1 to be 7990 . The N.M.R. spectrum showed peaks at 0.9 ppm gem. dimethyl protons in acid component , 2.2 ppm CH3 C c protons in acid component , 6.1 ppm vinylic protons in acid component , and 8 ppm vinylic proton in imidazole ring of alcohol component . The N.M.R. data confirmed that the ester contained the essential characteristics of both the metronidazole and retinoic acid moieties. Further identification of the ester was confirmed by hydrolysis. Under alkaline conditions retinoic acid was obtained as the only organic soluble product. Under acidic conditions metronidazole was obtained as the only identifiable product in the aqueous phase. Esters of metronidazole and mizonidazole with aliphatic carboxylic acids of the formula RCOOH in whichR is as hereinbefore defined may be prepared by well established procedures from metronidazole or mizonidazole and either a halide of the acid or the free acid itself. The nitroimidazole retinoates of formula I may be applied to skin affected by acne in an appropriate pharmaceutical composition for topical application. In addition to the active ingredient, such compositions may contain appropriate inert diluents known for use in pharmaceutical compositions for topical application to the skin. The composition must, of course, contain sufficient of the retinoate to produce the desired effect. A concentration of from 0.1 to 5.0 by weight of the composition is generally appropriate.In order to assure maximum stability of the composition, it may be formulated in a substantially anhydrous ointment base containing an appropriate oil soluble antioxidant such as 2,6 ditertiary butyl para cresol. Alternatively, it may be formulated as a cream, when the retinoate would be incorporated into the oleaginous phase while a water soluble antioxidant such as ascorbic acid would be dissolved in the aqueous phase. In lower concentrations it may also be used as an alcoholic solution or gel. The aforesaid pharmaceutical compositions comprising retinoic acid or a lower alkyl ester thereof and a nitroimidazole ester of formula II may be similarly made up using conventional diluents compatible with the active ingredients also including alcoholic solutions or gels for lower concentrations. It is normally appropriate for such compositions to contain 0.01 to 5.CX by weight of the retinoic acid or ester thereof and 0.1 to 5.0 by weight of the nitroimidazole ester.
