## Description
The invention relates to a process for the incorporation of foreign DNA into the genome of dicotyledonous plants by infecting the plants or by incubating plant protoplasts with It is known that the Ti plasmid of It will be clear from the above that the procaryotic bacterium Since the Ti plasmid does not maintain its position in Existing procedures for site location directed mutations of the Ti plasmids are described by Leemans et al, The Embo Journal 1, 147 152 1982 Matzke et al, J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1, 39 49 1981 vide for the general principle on which these techniques are based, Ruvkun et al, Nature London , 289, 85 88 1981 . The last step of the Ti plasmid mutation is always performed in These known procedures are rather laborious and give technical problems, which could be avoided of the site directed mutation of the Ti plasmid itself could directly be performed in Surprisingly, it has now been found that the desirable transfer of DNA from A. tumefaciens bacteria into plant cells, in which the transferred DNA is incorporated into the genome, can also be realised if the required The process according to the invention is characterised in that The invention presents new The new The use of the process according to the invention in which plants or plant cells with modified genetic information are obtained may be present in the improvement of plants cultivation of an improved species, which for instance is better resistant to herbicides , as well as in the realisation of a bioreactor for fermentation of plant cells optionally immobilised thereupon, which produce a specific desirable translation product, for instance enzyme, or a secondary metabolite of the plant cell, in large quantities. The process according to the invention therefore offers the possibility to manufacture mutants of higher plants having well defined genetically improved resp. modified properties in an otherwise unchanged background. As already remarked before this is vital to the plant breeding industry, the more so as from the tissue lines which are obtained with application of the process according to the invention regenerants can be obtained at an early stage after transformation. Furthermore, the cells with autotrophic growth, which are obtained with application of the process according, to the invention, for instance the Crown gall cells, only need a very simple synthetic medium for a good growth in a fermentator, to which medium no phytohormones need to be added. Cells thus obtained, in which foreign DNA is introduced, can be cultured on a large scale, for the production of those substances, for which the foreign DNA codes, such as alkaloids, aminoacids, hydrocarbons, proteins, enzymes, steroids, etc. of.

According to the invention The invention makes it possible that for the construction of plasmid with a T region but without a By the omission of the necessity to apply forced crossing over for introducing a new gene or genes into the T region of the intact Ti plasmid the binary vector system moreover has the advantage that it is no longer necessary to incorporate undesirable genes, including e.g. the The invention is illustrated hereinunder with the aid of the drawing in which Also examples of experiments are described, in which actually with the invention thus described both a new gene has been manipulated in the T region and transferred to the plant cell and a completely artificial T region was used with the same purpose. In order to obtain a plasmid which contains the intact T region of the octopine Ti plasmid pTiAch5 and both in Since this plasmid cannot replicate in The plasmid pAL1050 was introduced into a non oncogenous The pAL1050 was transferred by conjugation into the non oncogenous The capacity of tumour induction of the transconjugant strain LBA4434, which contained both the plasmid pAL1050 with T region and the plasmid pAL4404 with These experiments show that the vir region and the T region of the octopine Ti plasmid can be separated physically on different plasmids without the tumour inducing capacity of the bacterium being affected by it. Since One could think that the oncogenity of the Fig. 3 gives a picture of an octopine Ti plasmid, subdivided in a part responsible for tumour induction and a part responsible for the catabolism of octopine octopine catabolism gene Fig. 4A shows in outline the tumour induction which is caused by infection of plants or incubation of plant protoplasts with Fig. 4b and fig. 4c show that both Fig. 4d shows that tumour induction is possible indeed of the bacteria contain both plasmids simultaneously. Fig. 4e shows the process according to the invention, in which use is made of Fig. 5 shows in larger detail the structure of the T region of octopine Ti plasmids, after incorporation into the plant genome. At the extremities of the T region there is a special base sequence of about 23 base pairs bp which are involved in the transfer and integration of T DNA in the plant genome. Also, an artificial T DNA, incorporated into the plant genome, is shown which contains one or more desirable genes and a marker gene for the selection of transformants. In order to make expression of these genes in the plant cell possible, special base sequences are present, including a plant promotor Pp as a starting place for the transcription in RNA , which are needed for the regulation of the gene expression in eucaryots. In order to test the suitability of the invention described in practice an experiment was carried out, in which a bacterial gene was transferred with the binary vector system to the plant cell. The gene that codes for the enzyme chloroamphenicol transacetylase, which is expressed within the bacterium, and sees to resistance of the host against the antibiotic chloroamphenicol was selected for. This resistance gene is positioned on a DNA fragment which was manipulated in to the plasmid pAL1050, which treatment was carried out within the host Also a plurality of artificial T DNA s have been constructed as is indicated in fig. 5, where as plant marker the gene was used which codes for an enzyme called lysopine dehydrogenase or octopine synthase. This enzyme catalyzes only when present in plant cells the synthesis of octopine by reductive condensation of arginine and pyruvate. By infection of plants in accordance with the process according to the invention tumours were induced which indeed could synthesise octopine. The
