# EXTENDIBLE SONOBUOY APPARATUS

## Abstract
A sonobuoy has several components slidably mounted in an elongated tube 38 . The components are longitudinal ly stacked one above the other at the lower end of the tube when the sonobuoy is in a pre deployed state and are caus ed to slide longitudinally upwardly in the tube during sono buoy deployment to provide a predetermined longitudinal spacing between the components when the sonobuoy is deployed. The components typically include an electronics canister 36 , acoustic wave phase controls 72 and one or more active electroacoustic transducers 110 . The compo nents are attached to a plurality of flexible support cables 70 . The cables are attached at their respective upper ends to the bottom of the canister 36 and are attached at their lower ends to the bottom of the tube 38 . The cables are col lapsed during the pre deployed state and tautly ex tended during the deployed state. Axial guide strips 54 are affixed to the inner surface of the tube. The canister and transducer have recesses 52, 115 engaging the strips in a sliding fit to prevent rotation about the tube longitudinal axis during deployment. The electroacoustic transducer 110 may be mounted to the tube at a predetermined axial location on the tube.
