# Mold for molding a sleeve equipped reinforced plastic tubular body, and method for handling the mold.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method for molding a sleeve type reinforced plastic tubular body, such as a pipe coupling, and to a mold therefor. According to the method of this inven tion, a sleeve fitted reinforced plastic tubular body is pro duced by using a mold obtained by assembling a main body and sleeve molding members fixable and axially slidable to and along the outside surface of the main body. Accordingly, by providing sleeve molding members of different configura tions and sizes and using them exchangeably according to the configuration and size of the desired molded article, tubular bodies having a sleeve of differant configurations and sizes can be molded as required. Furthermore by adjusting the fixing position of the sleeve molding member with regard to the main body of the mold, tubular bodies having a tubular section of different lengths can be produced by using one type of mold.
