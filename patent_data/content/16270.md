# Attitude setting devices.

## Abstract
An attitude setting device for setting the attitude of a mounted member 10 , e.g. a thole pin, adjustably mounted on a base member 11 comprises a first setting element 12 and a second setting element 13 arranged for rotation about mutually inclined axes. Relative rotation of the tapered washer type elements 12, 13 varies the inclination, and co rotation the orientation, of the member 10 which can then be locked in a desired attitude by a locking means 16 . Alterna tively the setting elements are arranged for symmetrical contra rotation so as to alter only the inclination of the member 10 alterable orientation is achieved by providing a further pair of setting elements. Equivalent setting elements disclosed are skewed bushes and skewed sleeves. In further embodiments the setting elements are co axially mounted, eccentrically bored bushes surrounded by an internally cylindrical mounted member and circumferen tially and eccentrically mounted rotatable bushes through which the mounted member passes.

## Description
Attitude Setting DevicesThis invention relates t setting devices for setting the attitude, i.e. the inclination and or orientation, of a mounted member adjustably mounted on a base memberMany ways of varying the inclination and orientation of an adjustably mounted member are known for example, the member may be fixed relatively to one member of a ball and socket and thus be variably inclinable and orientable relatively to the other member of the balland socket. Alternatively a device of the gimbal type may be employed.Such known arrangements however suffer from various disadvantages amongst which may be mentioned the difficulty of locking the adjustable member in a predetermined inclination and orientation and the difficulty of accurately inclining or orientating the member in a desired predetermined position when employing a principle based on independent adjustment about mutually perpendicular axes.According to the present invention there is provided a setting device for setting the attitude of a mounted member adjustably mounted on a base member, the device comprising a first setting element arranged for rotation with respect to the base member and a second setting element arranged for rotation with respect to the first element, the elements being rotatable about respective mutually inclined axes or eccentrically mounted, and the arrangement being such that relative rotation of the elements varies the inclination of the mounted member.A setting device according to the present invention is usually incorporated into an adjustable mounting0 Preferably the pair of setting elements are a pair of co operating wedge s capable of combined rotation about one axis and of independent relative rotation about another axis passing therethrough and inclined to said one axis.The wedge angles of the wedges may be the same or different assuming that each wedge angle is alpha 2 , then the inclination of an axis defined by the mounted member can be varIed from 0 to alpha by a combination of rotation and relative rotation of the pair of wedges,In a modification of the embodiment employlng wedges the setting elements comprise a pair of skewed bushes provided with abutting tapered flanges .Alternatively, a pair of sleeves may be employed, one within the other , the bore or each sleeve being skew to its eft ernal cylindrical surface so that rotation of the sleeves and relative rotation thereof will vary the inclination and the orientation of the axis defined by the outer cylindrical surface of the outer sleeve.According to another embodiment of the present invention said elements are constitut d by first send second eccentric bushes or like members through which the mounted member passes, the bushes each being rotatable relative to the mounting and to each other, and further mounting means for the mounted member are provided at the point of intersection of the angle of the mounted member in a reference position and in a position inclined thereto Means may be provided for locking the bushes relative to each other and to said mounting. Preferably the second bush surrounds the first but it may be solid with the mounted member, provided that the latter is rotatable. AccordIng to yet another embodiment of the invention the elements are eccentrically mounted and comprise a pair of eccentrically bored sleeves each surrounded by bearings carried by the mounted member, relative rotation or rotation of the sleeves causing the inclination and or orientation of the axis of the mounted member to vary.The device of this invention may be readily calibrated both to predetermine the positions of the setting elements relative to each other and to predetermine the position of the pair of setting elements relatively to an external reference point such as, for example, a base plate.Locking means are preferably provided to lock the pair of setting elements both relatively to each and relatively to an external reference point. Although any suitable locking means may be employed such as, for example, one or more locking pins passing through aligned apertures in the setting elements, it is preferred that the setting elements be so mounted that they can be clamped together and to an external member such as a base plate. In particular, it is preferred that a form of ball and socket locking construction be employed in which a ball member attached to one of the setting elements can be lockingly urged into a socket member in the other setting element and or in an external member such as a base plate.The device of this invention may be made of any suitable material such as, for example, stainless steel, mild steel, brass, aluminium alloy, reinforced plastics materials, titanium alloy or carbon fibre composite.Clearly, the applications of the setting device of this invention are manifold since it may be employed in any situation where the orientation and or inclination of an axis of a mounted member is required to be varied. In particular the device may comprise or form part of the axle of a wheel, e.g. a steering or suspension axle of a motor vehicle the axle of a rotor, e.g. of a helicopter or of a marine propeller a mounting for an instrument, e.g. a telescope, theodolite or the like a mounting for setting a drilling, milling or grinding axis of a machine tool, e.g. a tool holder for a machine tool or a thole pin or rowlock for a rowing boat. One of the above mentioned applications of the setting device of the invention, besides that to thole pins, which is of particular importance, is that to the steering systems of land vehicles.The geometry of conventional steering systems inevitably represents a compromise. However, a system employing devices according to the invention in conjunction with sensors and a servo system can be mechanically or electrically programmed to give the best steering geometry at all times, even for multi wheel steering. It will be understood that these applications are given by way of example only and it will be further understood that the invention embraces any apparatus, vehicle or machine incorporating a device in accordance with the present invention.Embodiments of the device of this invention as incorporated into adjustable mountings will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a side elevation, partly in section, of an adjustable mounting according to the invention S e 2 is an end elevation, also partly in section, of the mounting of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a plan of the mounting of Figures 1 and 2 Figure 4 is an exploded perspective view of a mounting according to the invention for altering the inclination of a thole pin Figure 5 is an elevation of the thole pin partly shown in Figure 4 Figure 6 is a section on the line VI VI of Figure 5 Figure 7 is a section on the line Vil Vil of Figure 5 Figure 8 is a plan of a tapered washer shown in Figure 5 Figure 9 is an elevation of the washer of Figure 8 Figure 10 is a plan of a plate shown in Figure 5 Figure 11 is an elevation of the plate of Figure 10 Figures 12 to 15 are each a view, similar to that of Figure 1,showing further embodiments of adjust able mountings according to the invention.In the ensuing description, the same reference numbers are employed to denote the same or similar partsThe adjustable mounting shown in Figures 1 to 3 is a device for setting and locking a pin 10 in a desired attitude in relation to a base plate 11 and comprises a pair of two co operating independently rotatable wedges or tapered washers 12, 13 each having a triangular extension and each being provided with an aperture through which freely passes the pin 10 which is provided with a flange 14 bearing against the upper surface of the wedge 13.The lower end of the pin 10 is threaded as at 15 and passes through an aperture in the base plate 11, the underside of which is countersunk to accommodate a domed locking nut 16 received in the threaded portion 15 of the pin 100 As may be seen from Figure 3 the upper surfaces of the triangular extensions of the wedges 12, 13 are provided with arcuate markings 17 for calibrating the inclination of the axis of the pin 10 and the visible upper surface of the base plate 11 is provided with radial markings 18 for calibrating the orientation of the pin axis.The principle underlying this embodiment will readily be appreciated from Figures 1 to 3. With the nut 16 slackened off the wedges 12, 13 are free to rotate. As the upper wedge 13 having a wedge angle of a 20 between its upper and lower surfaces is rotated relative to the lower edge 12 wedge angle also a 20 , the combined wedge angle will vary from OO to a0 and cause the angle of the flange 14 to alter correspondingly, hence the inclination of the axis of the pin 10 to the vertical will vary from OO to a . The angle of inclination is set by reading off the markings 17 on the wedge 12 against those on the wedge 13.The orientation of the pin axis is determined by the direction of a line passing through the axis and the point of intersection or overlap of the two wedges 12, 13 Figure 3 .By rotation of the pair of wedges 12, 13 relatively to the base plate 11 the orientation of the pin axis may be varied, the degree of orientation being read off by the position of the point of intersection against the markings 18. By virtue of the variable orientation the total possible variation in the inclination of the pin axis is a0 to the vertical.After the pin 10 has been set at the desired attitude the nut 16 is tightened to clamp the wedges 12, 13 and the base plate A1 axially against the flange 14. The upper wedge 15 may be integral with the pin 10 in which case it is necessary that the pin 10 be rotatable about its axis.The wedges 12, 13 may be located on the underside of the base plate 11 in which case alternative locking means may be required. For example the flange 14 of the pin 10 may be provided with a convex lower surface to cooperate with a countersunk upper surface of the base plate 11. This embodiment of Figures 1 to 3 is particularly suitable for incorporation in a rowlock of a racing rowing boat in which case the pin 10 constitutes a thole pin for supporting the oar. For such an application the variation in inclination required is typically 0 to 150 together with an ability to vary the orientation in any direction.Figures 4 to 11 show an adjustable mounting for altering the pitch of a thole pin 20 in a fixed pitching direction.As shown in Figures 4 and 5 the thole pin 20 is provided at its lower end with a flange 21 beyond which projects a square shank 22, terminating in a threaded portion 23, the shank 22 being freely received in a corresponding aperture in a supporting plate 24 secured to the hull of a racing rowing boat in a conventional manner. A washer 25 and locking nut 26 having co operating spherical surfaces are received in the threaded portion 23. The upper end portion of the pin 20 is threaded in the normal way.Positioned between the plate 24 and the flange 21 are a pair of pitch washers 27 and 28 and an interposed slide plate 29.The pitch washer 29 See Figures and 9 has an upper surface, which is inclined to its lower surface, and a circular central aperture 30 formed wi th a lobe .310 A scale plate 32 extends from one side of the washer 29 and is calibrated at 60 intervals with engraved radial lines 33. The outer arcuate edge 34 is scalloped and terminates at one end in a radial pro jection 35. The washer 28 is of similar form but in reversed position.with the scale plate 32 consequently engraved on the other side from that of the washer 27.The slide plate 29 See Figures 10 and 11 has a rectangular central aperture 36 of a shorter dimension such that it is a close fit on the corresponding flats of the shank 22. Flanking the aperture 36 are a pin 37 extending upwardly into the lobe 31 of the washer 27 and a apin 38 extending downwardly into the lobe 31 of the washer 28. At the apex of its pointed end the plate 29 has a pointer 39 having an inwardly facing pip 40.Do adjust the pitch of the thole pin 20 the nut 26 is slackened off and one of the pitch washers 27 and 28 rotated. The pro ections 35, besides providing suitable finger holds, also act to limit the rotation of the washers by abutment with the pointer 39. this movement of, say, the washer 27, causes sliding movement of the slide plate 29 by the camping action of the pin 37 in. the lobe 31 and consequent counter rotation, by a similar action, through an equal angle of the washer 28.The degree of relative rotation between the washers 27and 28 will alter the inclination of the lower surface of the washer 28 to the upper surface of the washer 27 in the manner described in relation to Figures 1 to 3 and hence the attitude imparted to the flange 21, and consequently the pin 20, with respe ct to the supporting plate 24. The angle of pitch thus imparted to the pin 20 can be read directly from the position of the pointer 39 against the scale 33 on the upper washer 27 and the engagement of the pip 40 in one of the indentations on each of the scalloped edges 34 prevents inadvertent alteration of the setting before the nut 26 can be tightened to lock the pin 20 in the desired inclination.The mounting described above enables the pitch of the thole pin 20 to be varied only in a fixed pitching direction.To enable the thole pin 20 to be adjusted to. any desired attitude, that is to obtain variation in both the inclination and orientation of the pin 20, a further pair of washers 27 and 28 and an interposed slide plate 29 may be employed, acting in a direction at right angles to the direction of the described embodiment.By use of the two sets of tapered washers the attitude of the pin may be set by Cartesian co ordinates which may make for simpler setting and therefore readier consumer acceptance that is possible than with setting based on polar co ordinates as employed in the embodiment of Figures 1 to 3.Other means of engaging the plate 29 with the washers 27 and 28 may be employed, for example co operating teeth.Figure 12 shows a modification of the mounting of Figures I to 3 in which there is employed a cylindrical apertured base plate 51 and, instead of the wedges 12, 13, there are employed skewed bushes 42, 43, the lower bush 42 being rotatable with respect to an axis as defined by the base plate 11 and the upper bush 43 being rotatable about the pin 10 passing therethrough. As the nut 16 cannot act directly on the base plate 11 an apertured and countersunk moveable plate 44 is interposed. It will be appreciated that the embodiment of Figure 12 avoids the necessity for clearance between the pin 10 and the apertures of the washers 12, 13 and for free movement of the pin 10 within the base plate 11 as is necessary in the embodiment of Figures 1 to 3. It is to be noted moreover that the upper skewed bush 43 may be integral with the pin 10. Aey other suitable locking means may be employed instead of that shown inFigure 12.Figure 13 shows a further embodiment 6f an adjustable mounting according to this invention in which a pin 50 remains perpendicular to the base plate 51 into which it is screwed and does not undergo a variation in inclination and or orientation.Mounted for rotation on the pin 50 is an inner skewed sleeve 52 having the axis of its outer cylindrical surface inclined to that of its inner cylindrical surface.Rotatably mounted on the inner sleeve 52 is an outer skewed sleeve 53 again having an outer cylindrical surface inclined to that of its inner surface. Locking is by means of a nut 16 received on the upper threaded end of the pin 50 and a co operating plate 54 engaging the upper end free of the sleeve 53. The inner sleeve 52 may be integral with the pin 50, in which case the pin 50 should be capable of rotation about its axis Th this embodiment it is of course the outer skewed sleeve 53 which is capable of variation in inclination and or orientation.In the embodiment of Figure 14 a pin 60 is formed with a terminal ball 61 received in a socket formed in a base plate 62 and having a bearing layer 63. A ball andsocket joint is thus formed at the point of intersection of a vertical reference position of the pins indicated by the line V and an inclined position indicated by the line I. The pin 60 passes through an inner eccentric bush 64 which is rotatable within an outer eccentric bush 65 which is in itself rotatably mounted in an upper mounting plate 66.The geometry of the internal frusto conical face of the outer bush 65, of its external frusto conical face, and of the respective co operating faces of the inner bush 64 and of the mounting plate 66 is such that, by rotation of the inner bush 64 relative to the outer bush 65, there may be achieved a desired inclination of the pin 60 to the line V which passes through the axis of rotation of the outer bush 65 and that by rotation of the outer bush 65 relative to the mounting plate 66 a desired orientation of the pin 60 may be achieved.locking means nt shown are provided to enable the positions of the bushes 64 and 65 to be fixed relative to the upper plate 66 once the desired attitude of the pin 60 has been achieved.Finally, Figure 15 shows an adjustable mounting according to this invention in which a pair of rotatable sleeves 72, 73 are employed each having an eccentric bore through which passes the pin 70 in contrast to the previouslydescribed embodiments in which the rotatable elements rotate about respective mutually inclined axes, the sleeves 72, 73 rotate about a common axis. The adjustable member is constituted by a sleeve 74 in the bore of which are mounted two ball races 75, 76 having spherical bearings 77 engaging the sleeves 72, 73. An attitude defined jointly by the sleeves 72, 73 is thus imparted to the sleeve 74 which is supported by the flange 72a of the lower sleeve.The sleeves 72, 73 may be replaced by eccentric spherical or part spherical sleeves or other eccentrically mounted components It should be noted additionally that one of the.upper and lower sleeves 72, 73 may be formed integrally with the pin 50 in which case the pin should be capable of rotation about its axis locking is effected by means of a standard nut 78 received on the end of the pin 50 partly through the washer 79.The calibration of a device according to this invention may be such that the angle of inclination and direction of orientation of the mounted member may be set by direct observation of a pointer against calibration marks, e.g by means of marks calibrated in degrees of inclination, or alternatively the attitide of the mounted member read off directly. Except in special cases, such as the embodiment of Figures 4 to 11, the attitude of the mounted member is defined in terms of polar, and not Cartesian, co ordinates, which is often a more useful form of indication. The present invention is thus capable of providing a cheap, highly compact and reliable device by means of which an axis can be inclined at any angle between 00 and 900 and orientation of an axis can be simply and , accurately adjusted to a predetermined position, even under load, and then rigidly fixed in that position for as long as required.
