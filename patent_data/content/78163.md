# Gear wheel.

## Abstract
A frustoconical ring body comprises at least one and preferably a pile of tough and elastic, frustoconical ring elements 11 each having a central opening 11a for slidably accepting therethrough a first cylindrical member 1 and an outer edge 11e adapted for engagement with a second member 4 . The ring element Figs. 2a,2b, not shown has a plurality of outer slits 11f extending radially inwardly from the outer edge and a plurality of inner slits 11d extending radially outwardly from the central opening. An inclination adjusting member 6 is displaceable along one of the 1,4 members so as to maintain a bearing contact with the ring body and to change a frustoconical angle, thereby regulating the state of engagement of the ring body with the first and second members. The assembly may be used either as a bearing a brake to mount a bearing race or as a gear, in which case the outer edge of the ring body has gear teeth which mesh with teeth on the second member.
