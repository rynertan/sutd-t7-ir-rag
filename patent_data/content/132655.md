# Enzymatic conversion of certain sub type A and AB erythrocytes.

## Abstract
Type O erythrocytes are produced from certain subtypes of A erythrocytes or type AB erythrocytes by contacting the same following equilibration of a pH of 5.6 5.8 with an α N acetylgalactosaminidase, preferably obtained from an avian liver, for periods sufficient to convert the A antigen in the eryhrocyte to the H antigen. Following removal of the enzyme, the erythrocyte is re equilibrated to a pH of 7.2 7.4. As a result, there is obtained O type erythrocytes character ized by a 60 to 90 percent ATP level based on the level of ATP in naturally occurring O or AB erythrocytes. Beginning with certain A cells one obtains synthetic O erythrocytes character ized by a terminal α fucose moiety, O antigenicity, and the absence of A antigenicity. Beginning with A₂B erythrocytes, one obtains B erythrocytes by the same process characterized by the absence of A antigenicity, greater H antigenicity than naturally occurring A₂B cells, the presence of B antigenicity and the afore described ATP levels.
