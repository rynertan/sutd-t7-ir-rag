# Transistor structure.

## Abstract
A transistor structure has a collector region 11, 61 , a base region 12, 62 and a stripe form emitter zone 13, 63 , of collector region conductivity type, formed within the base region 12, 62 . Within the emitter zone 13, 63 isolation regions 14 or stabilizing resistor regions 64 of the base region conductivity type are formed to divide the emitter zone 13, 63 into small emitter regions 13 a, 13 b etc . The small emitter regions are connected in parallel by an emitter electrode 16a 67a, 67b which extends over the stripe form emitter zone 13, 63 . The emitter electrode is connected to each small emitter region directly or by way of a stabilizing resistor region 43, 53, 64 . A plurality of stripe form emitter zones 102, 113 can be connected in common see Fig.7 or Fig. 8 by a region 101, 117 of the same conductivity type as the emitter zones 102, 113 . To prevent parasitic transistor operation an isolation region 103 or a stabilizing resistor region 114 is disposed between an emitter zone 102, 113 and the connecting region 101, 117 .
