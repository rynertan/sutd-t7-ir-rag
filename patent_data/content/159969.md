# Process for stretching the vamp of mocassins and a device with which to implement the process.

## Abstract
The process is defined by a cyclic succession of identi cal phases, through each of which the part of the skin sub jected to stretching is gradually wound from one extremity to the other, and vice versa, by means of a continuous or dis crete surface that exercises an adjustable pressure thereon. A device with which the process can be carried out is constituted by a netted container 6, hung from a support 5, housing spherical objects 7 and banded circumferentially with an elastic 8. The bottom end 9 of the container 6 is hooked to a wire 10 that defines, in the said end, an adjust able depth lip 11. With the said support 5 given a top downward and vice versa movement, the bottom end 9 of the container 6 comes into contact with the vamp 3 and then enshrouds this com pletely. Consequently to the motion given to the support 5, the spherical objects 7 that protrude from the meshes 6a in the net come, first of all, into contact with the skin of the vamp 3 and then roll over and or rub, under pressure, against the said skin which is gradually stretched.
