# Microstrip patch antenna system.

## Abstract
A microstrip antenna system 10 is comprised of either a single antenna element patch 16 or a plurality of stacked antenna elements 16,36 and 40 having one or more feedpins 30 connected to a corresponding number of conductive elements flags 28 capacitively coupled to the antenna element or elements. The one or more feedpins 30 have an inductive reactance which is canceled by trimmed flags 28 to provide the capacitance necessary to cancel the inductance for tuning the one or more antennas 16, 36 and 40 and providing maximum gain and minimum VSWR.
