## Description
A FLUORESCENT LAMP The present invention relates to a fluorescent lamp, for example to a compact fluorescent lamp having a vacuum tight radiation transmitting tube including at least one U shaped portion. Fluorescent lamps are widely used because of their high luminous efficiency in comparison with incandescent lamps and it is advantageous to use fluorescent lamps instead of incandescent lamps fromthe standpoint of electric power consumption. In order to replace an incandescent lamp with a fluorescent lamp, it is necessary for a fluorescent lamp to be made a compact size, such as with a vacuum tight radiation transmitting tube including a U shaped portion or even three Ushaped portions, to obtain a light output as great as that of an incandescent lamp. Consequently, the diameter of the tubular envelope of a fluorescent lamp must become small according to its compact lamp size. For example, published United Kingdom patent Application Serial No 2,033,653 describes such a compact fluorescent lamp. Owing to the reduction of the envelope diameter, not only wall loading W m lamp watts per square metre but also the ampere density of the fluorescent lamp are increased. Moreover, about 185 nanometer nm wavelength ultraviolet radiation is increased as well as about 254 nm wavelength ultraviolet radiation. Generally, ultraviolet radiation having a wavelength about 254 nm is converted to visible radiation by the phosphor layer but about 185 nm wavelength radiation is not efficiently converted to visible radiation by the phosphor. Moreover, 185 nm wavelength radiation damages conventional phosphors, such as calcium halophosphate phosphors which are now used in almost all types of fluorescent lamps for general illumination purposes. So, it is impossible to obtain the desired light output. According to the present invention from one aspect, there is provided a fluorescent lamp comprising a vacuum tight radiation transmitting tube mercury and rare gas in said tube electrodes in said tube between which discharge takes place during operation and a phosphor layer coating a surface of said tube, said phosphor layer including a plurality of phosphors including at least a red light emitting phosphor, at least 40 percent by weight of said phosphor layer being said red light emitting phosphor. According to the present invention from another aspectthere is provided a compact fluorescent lamp comprising a vacuum tight radiation transmitting convoluted tube having 2 a wall loading in the range of 600 900 Wim mercury and rare gas in said tube electrodes in said tube between which discharge takes place during operation and a phosphor layer coating a surface of said tube, said phosphor layer including a plurality of phosphors including at least a red light emitting phosphor, at least 40 percent by weight of said phosphor layer being said red light emitting phosphor. The present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the single figure of the accompanying drawing, which is a perspective view, partly broken away, of a compact fluorescent lamp. Referring now to the figure, reference numeral 10 designates a compact fluorescent lamp for 100V 15W having a vitreous convoluted tube with a superposed phosphor layer 2. Sealed in each end of the tube 1 is a respective one of stems 3, each comprising an electrode, supported by lead in wires 4. The tube 1 encloses a quantity of mercury and a quantity of rare gas to sustain a low pressure, ultraviolet generating discharge between the electrodes, during operation. Selection of the quantity of mercury and rare gas is made in the same manner as for conventional fluorescent tubes and is well known in the art. The inner diameter of the tube 1 is about 15 mm and the wall loading of the tube 1 is about 705 W m2. Any suitable phosphors may be used. As a blue light emitting phosphor, one may select at least one from a strontium calcium halophosphate activated by europium barium magnesium aluminate activated by europium a strontium calcium barium halo boro phosphate activated by europium and strontium chlorophosphate activated by europium.As a green light emitting phosphor, one may select at least one from lanthanum phosphate activated by cerium and terbium magnesium aluminate activated by cerium and terbium yttrium silicate activated by cerium and terbium and lanthanum silicophosphate activated by cerium and terbium. As a red light emitting phosphor,one may select yttrium oxide activated by europium. A mixture phosphor is made by using three kinds of phosphors mixed in the proper ratio, e.g. as a blue light emitting phosphor,a strontium calcium chlorophosphate activated by europium 3 Sr3 PO4 2CaCl2 Eu hereinafter called a B phosphor as a green light emitting phosphor, yttrium silicate activated by cerium and terbium Y2SiO5 Ce,Tb hereinafter called a G phosphor , and as a red light emitting phosphor, yttrium oxide activated by europium Y203 Eu hereinafter called a R phosphor . The present inventors have produced a compact fluorescent lamp with a convoluted tube for 100V 15W so as to have its colour temperature 3,0000K by using the above mentioned B , G and R phosphors. The specific luminous flux as well as the lumen maintenance factor after lighting for 1,000 hours have been tested.The results, including values from using a conventional phospllor layer as a reference, are shown in the following Table 1.

However the drop of the lumen maintenance factor is outstanding for test number 5 although the specific luminous flux is high compared with using the conventional phosphor layer.It is considered that this is due to the fact that the containing ratio of R phosphor is low less than 40 by weight , so the B and G phosphors are deteriorated by 185 nm wavelength ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, it can be understood that the mixture ratio of the above R phosphor is required to be at least 40 by weight in order to obtain at least the same lumen maintenance factor as that of using the conventional phosphor layer. In addition, the present inventors have prepared other mixture phosphors i and ii shown in the following Table 2 using other B and G phosphors in the proper ratio. Tests have been done in respect of a compact fluorescent lamp for 100V 15W. The results are shown in the followingTable 3.

In the case that the wall loading is smaller than 600 W m2, the effect in accordance with the invention is little because the deterioration of the phosphor due to the 185 nm wavelength ultraviolet radiation is little. On the other hand, in the case that the wall loading is larger than 900 W m2, the temperature of the convoluted tube increases. As a result, the mercury vapour pressure in the airtight tube becomes high, and thus the luminous efficiency is down. Another experiment using two phosphor layers has been carried out. That is, a first phosphor layer, disposed directly on the inner surface of the convoluted tube, is composed of a calcium halophosphate activated by antimony and manganese. A second phosphor layer coated on the first phosphor layer is composed of the same component as shown in Test number 7 in the Table 3. The result has been shown to have the same effect as is shown in the Table 3, i.e. as regards the specific luminous flux and the operative characteristics. It is considered that this is attributable to the fact that the 185 nm wavelength ultraviolet radiation was converted to visible light by the red light emitting phosphor in the second phosphor layer and does not reach the first phosphor layer composed of a calcium halophosphate activated by antimony and manganese . The vacuum tight radiation transmitting convoluted tube 1 has at least one U shaped portion and a wall loading in the range of 600 900W m2 and an inner diameter of the tube in the range of 10 20 mm are suitable for practical use.
