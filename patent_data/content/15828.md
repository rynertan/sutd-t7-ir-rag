## Description
STRESS CRACK RESISTANT POLYARYLATES AND PROGRESS FOR THE FREPARATION BACKGROUND OF THE IWENTION This invention pertains to stress crack resistant polyarylates and more particularly to bisphenol A iso terephthalates modified with 4,4 biphenol. Polyarylates or polyesters derived from bishenol A and iso terephthalic acids are tough materials having a continuous use temperature of about 1400C. However, as with many other amorphous thermoplastics, they possess poor solvent and stress crack resistance. Such polyesters may be represented as having repeating units as shown belowEMI1.1 On the other hand, H. G. Weyland et al. reported in Euro.Poly J. 6, 1339 1970 that a 4,4 biphenol iso terephthalate prepared by interfacial polymerization was both insoluble and infusible. Isophthalates of 4,4 biphenol modified with hydroquinone are described in U.S. 3,036,991 and 3,160,602. These copolymers contain at least 40 mol percent of hydroquinone isophthalate and were prepared via the reaction of the di functional phenols with isophthaloyl chloride in solvents boiling above 300 C. These polyesters are highly crystalline having melting points ranging from 350 to 4000C. SlowLy cooled moldings are crystalline and translucent while rapidly cooled or quenched moldings are amorphous and transparent. No mechanical data are revealed in these references. Linear co polyesters have been prepared from terephthalic or isophthalic acid, a bizphenol and hydroquinone containing 5 to 35 mol percent of the hydroquinone. Bisphenol A polyesters of isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid or iso terephthalic acid mixtures lack solvent and stress crack resistance. 4,4 Biphenol polyesters of iso terephthalic acid mixtures are solvent resistant but are not melt processable. U.S. 3,939,117 discloses a method for producing a polyarylene ester at temperatures of O to 1000C in an organic solvent for the polyarylene ester in the presence of solid Ca OH 2 and a polymerization catalyst. One or more divalent phenols and aromatic dicarboxylic chlorides are used butthere is no appreciation of the use of a particular ratio of particular divalent phenols to afford polyarylates having enhanced solvent and stress crack resistance. SWtARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been unexpectedly found that polyarylate compositions that contain isophthalic acid moieties or a mixture of isophthalic and terephthalic acid moieties, and about 20 to about 80 mol percent of 4,4 biphenol moieties and about 80 to about 20 mol percent of bisphenol A moieties based on total diphenol content of the polymer are solvent resistant, stress crack resistant and melt processable. The diacids and dlhydric phenols are in essentially stoichiometric quantities. The preferred polyarylate compositions consist of a dicarboxylic acid structure consisting essentially of isophthalic terephthalic acid mol ratios of about 50 50 to about 100 0 together with a dihydric phenol mixture consisting es sentially of 4,4 biphenol bisphenol A mol ratios of about 20 80 to about 50 50. The more preferred composition consist of an isophthalic terephthalic acid mol ratio of about 50 50 to about 75 25 and a dihydric phenol mixture consisting eo sentially of a 4,4 biphenol bisphenol A mol ratio of about 30 70 to about 55 45. The resultant copolyarylates have both enhanced solvent resistance and stress crack resistance and they possess excellent thermal properties, processability, toughness and flammability characteristics. This combination of properties was unexpected in view of the properties of the polyarylates prepared from either bisphenol A or 4,4 biphenol alone. The polyarylates can be prepared by any of the polyester forming reactions known to those skilled in the art. Either of two additive sequences of reactants can be used. In the first procedure, diacid and the diphenol reactants are charged and polymerized simultaniously hereinafter referred to as simultanious addition . In the second procedure one of the diphenol reactants is charged with the acid reactants, polymerization is initiated and then the other diphenol reactant is added and the reaction is allowed to progress hereinafter referred to as sequential addition . The normally solid polyarylates have the following repeating units A B A D wherein A is a mixture ofEMI3.1 in a mol ratio containing up to about 90 mol percent of the former EMI3.2 wherein each of R1 and H2 are each H or alkyl groups having 1 to about 7 carbons, R3, R4, R5, and R6, are alkyl groups having 1 to about 18 carbons, and a and b are integers having values of O to 4EMI4.1 wherein the mol ratio of A B to A D is in the range of about 20 to about 80 to about 80 to about 20 and the mole ratio of A to B and D is approximately stoichiometric. Exemplary 2,2 bis p hydroxyphenyl alkanes include 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 2,4 dihydroxydiphenylmethane, bis 2 hydroxyphenyl methane, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane, bis 4 hydroxy 2,6 dimethyl 3 methoxyphenyl methane, 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane, 1,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane, 1 , 1 bis 4 hydroxy 2 chlorophenyl ethane, 1 , 1 bis 3 methyl 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane, 1 ,3 bis 3 methyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 3 phenyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 3 isopropyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 2 isopropyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxynaphthyl propane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane, 3,3 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl heptane, and 1,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1,2 bis phenyl propane. Any known polyester forming reactions can be used to make the polyarylates, such as 1 The reaction of the acid chlorides of isophthalic and terephthalic acids with the diphenols. 2 The reaction of the aromatic diacids with diester derivatives of the diphenolsEMI5.1 where R C1 to C20 aliphatic skeletons, hereinafter referred to as the Diacetate Process. 3 The reaction of the diaryl esters of the aromatic diacidsEMI5.2 where Ar can be a phenyl, o tolyl, m tolyl, tolyl, or like residues, with the diphenols, hereinafter referred to as theDiphenate Process. Two procedures can be used for the preparation of the polyarylates via the acid chloride route. One is carried out at low temperature and the other at high temperature. In the low temperature technique polycondensation of the acid chlorides derived from terephthalic and isophthalic acid with the dihy dric phenols is effected at ambient temperatures in an inert solvent, such as methylene chloride, in the presence of a basic catalyst and an acid acceptor. A second immiscible solvent, e.g., water, may be present. In the high temperature technique, polycondensation of acid chlorides with the dihydric phenols is effected in a high boiling solvent, such as, 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene, at temperatures above about 1500C and preferably at about 200 to about 22000. Other suitable inert organic solvents useful for low temperature polycondensation include halogenated aliphatic com pounds, such as, chloroform, methylene bromide, 1,1,2 trich loroethane as well as methylene chloride mentioned above and the like and cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and the like. For the high temperature polycondensation, suitable solvents include halogenated aromatic compounds such as, o dichlorobenzene, 1 ,2,4 trichlorobenzene, diphenyl ether, diphenyl sulfone, benzoic acid alkyl esters wherein the alkyl group contains 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, phenolic ethers, suc as, anisole, and the like. Preferred acid acceptors for use in the low temperature polycondensation are alkali metal and alkaline earth hydro xides including sodium, potassium, barium, calcium, strontium magnesium, and beryllium hydroxide. Useful basic catalysts for use in the low temperature polycondensation include tertiary amines such as alkyl amines, including trimethylamine, triethylamine, triporpylamine, tributylamine, and the like where the alkyl group contains from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms alkaryl amines such as, N,N dimethylaniline, N, N diethylaniline, N,N dimethylnaphthylamine, b enzyl dimethylamine, alpha methylb enzyl dimethylamine, pyridine, cyclic diazo compounds, such as, diazobicyclooctane DABCO , diazo bicyclononene DUN and diazobicycloundecene DBU and the like. Polymerizations using the Diacetate Process can be carried out in the melt at between 2600C and 3400C, preferably between 2750C and 32000. They can also be carried out either as a solution reaction at those temperatures or a suspension reaction also at those temperatures. The solvent s or suspending agent s can be one of any number of organic compounds boiling between 1400C and 34000. They can be chosen from hydrocarbons, ketones, ethers, or sulfones which are inert under the reaction conditions. These polymerizations may or may not be run in the presence of a catalyst. Typical solvents are tetramethylene sulfone, diphenyl ether, substituted diphenyl ether, and the like.Typical catalysts include Na, Li, K salts organic and inorganic , transition metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts, e.g., Mg acetate, and the like.They may be performed at atmospheric pressure, supra atmospheric pressure, or under vacuum. Polymerizations carried out using the Diphenate Process can be carried out in the melt at between 2850C and 35000. The preferred temperature range is about 3000C to 34000. In general reduced pressure for the final portions of the reaction is used. They can also be carried out either as a solution reaction or suspension reaction under those conditions.The solvent s or suspending agent s are the same as those described above. Typical catalysX include tin compounds and generally those mentioned above for the diacetate process.Particularly preferred catalysts are Ti and tin salts, Mg acetate, and alkali metal salts, alkoxides and phenoxides. Mechanical properties of the subject polyarylates were determined as a function of monomer content and mode of addition. As shown in Tables I and II, excellent toughness, measured by pendulum impact values of 1,110 kg m dm5, was acid eved for compositions containing less than 50 mol percent of 4,4 biphenol and less than 50 mol percent of terephthalic acid. Polyarylates obtained via the acid chloride route using either the simultaneous or sequential addition methods gave approximately the same values. Examples of the thermal properties of 4,4 biphenol modified polyarylates are delineated in Table III. These data show that the high second order glass transition temperatures Tg are characteristic of the materials of this invention.In the acid chloride route the mode of addition of reactants simultaneous vs. sequential appears to have a slight effect on the Tg. However, a significant difference in the flow temperatures was noted under the same experimental conditions.In all cases, the temperature at which the sequentially prepared materials flow is significantly higher greater than 3400C as opposed to 2900C to 31000 . The 4,4 biphenol modified polyarylates showed improvement in stress crack resistance when the amount of 4,4 bi phenol was equal to or greater than 20 mol percent based on the total diphenol content. These data are presented in Table IT. Table IV also demonstrates the superior stress crack resistance of a copolymer derived from a 60 40 mol percent mixture of bisphenol A and 4,4 biphenol and a 75 25 mol percent mixture of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid over a polyarylate derived from bisphenol A alone and a 75 25 mol percent mixture of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid. Compositions containing 20 biphenol are preferred. Those 30 and 55 are particularly preferred.The preferred isophthalic terephthalic acid ratio is 50 50 to 100 0 while the most preferred is 50 50 to 75 25. Polyarylates modified with 4,4 biphenol also display excellent flammability characteristics. This was demonstrated with a 60 40 mol ratio bisphenol A, 4,4 biphenol copolymer isophthalic acid terephthalic acid mol ratio of 75 25 prepared by the simultaneous addition route and evaluated by theUnderwriters laboratory1s Bulletin 94, Test Procedure UI 94 . The test results obtained with films ranging in thickness from 1.19 to 1.35 mm showed superior flammability characteristics as delineated in Table V. If desired a chain stopper can be used to control the molecular weight of the polyarylates obtained. Suitable agents include monohydric phenols or their derivatives, such as, p pnenyl ohenol, and the like and monofunctional carboxylic acid or their derivatives, such as benzoic or naphthoic acids, and the like. The invention is further described in the Examples which follow. All partz and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified.
