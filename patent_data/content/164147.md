# An arrangement on a conveyor.

## Abstract
In the packaging industry finished packing containers are frequently transported by means of chain conveyors between different machines or handling points. A reorientation of the packing containers, e.g. from a horizontal to a vertical position, may then be required. To achieve this, an arragement may be included as an integrated part on a conveyor, making use of the chain and drive element of the conveyor. The chain 1 is then led with the help of pulleys 3 6 on a path which is such that several parts 7 9 of the chain, whilst successively changing position, travel close to the packing container conveyed so that the latter during its advance through the arrangement is reorientated from e.g. horizontal to vertical position.
