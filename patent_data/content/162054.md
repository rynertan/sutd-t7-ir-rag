## Description
This invention is in the field of microbiology and more specifically relates to recombinant DNA techniques for producing genetically engineered microorganisms. Hepatitis A virus HAV is an important cause of human hepatitis. In the United States it has been estimated that over 100,000 clinical cases occur annually. HAV continues to be endemic in underdeveloped areas of the world where infections usually occur in children, and nearly all of the young adult population have antibody to HAV anti HAV . Clinical hepatitis A and prevalence of anti HAV are decreasing in industrialized nations, resulting in increasing numbers of adults susceptible to infection. HAY is spread predominately by the fecal oral route. Spread of hepatitis A is usually associated with overcrowding, poor hygiene, or breakdown in normal sanitary conditions. Contaminated food or water are frequent vehicles of spread. Groups at high risk include institutionalized persons, contacts of very young children in day care centers, male homosexuals, consumers of raw shellfish and travelers to areas of the world where the disease is endemic. The host range of HAV is limited to man, apes especially the chimpanzee , and several species of New World monkeys. The incubation period for natural infections with HAV in man ranges from 15 to 45 days and averages 25 days. The first serological marker to appear is HAV in the stool, which often occurs 7 10 days before the onset of symptoms dark urine or jaundice . Viral replication appears to be limited to the liver and excretion into the stool, where the highest levels of infectious virus are found, probably occurs via the biliary system. The virus is often rapidly cleared after the onset of symptoms and becomes undetectable in the stool. However, in some individuals, HAV can be found in the stool for longer periods. Radioimmunoassay is a sensitive technique for detecting HAY in stool samples during the period of excretion, but it is not used in most clinical laboratories because assays for anti HAV in serum described below are more easily performed and accurate. Therefore, patients with hepatitis A are usually considered as potentially infectious for up to two weeks after the onset of jaundice. Hepatitis A usually resolves with weeks, but occasionally illness may persist for several months. Mortality from hepatitis A or associated chronic liver disease are very unusual occurrences. Anti HAV is almost always detectable in serum when symptoms begin. Because of this, diagnosis of hepatitis A is established using commercially available assays that are based on detection of anti HAV IgM. An example of such an assay is that produced and marketed by Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL under the name HAVAB M The 27 nm virion of HAV was first visualized in 1973. See, Feinstone, S. M., Kapikian, A. Z. Purcell, R. H. 1973 HAV has a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 160 S and a primary buoyant density of 1.34 g ml in CsC1. Virion capsid polypeptides of M Despite extensive efforts, analysis of the molecular structure and events in replication of HAV have been impeded because of the difficulty in cultivating HAV in cell culture. Although attempts have been made to clone cDNA for HAV, these have met with only limited success. For example, cloned cDNAs of less than 1,000 base pairs have been reported.

The present invention relates to clonal cell lines transformed with particular recombinant DNA vectors. More specificially, the invention provides a clonal cell line transformed with a recombinant DNA vector containing any one of HAV In one embodiment, the invention provides a clonal cell line transformed with a recombinant DNA vector containing HAV In another embodiment, the invention provides a clonal cell line transformed with a recombinant DNA vector containing HAV The present invention also provides HAV cDNA derived from a clonal cell line as described hereinabove. The HAV cDNA is produced by reverse transcribing HAV RNA and inserting the resulting cDNA molecule into a recombinant DNA vector to give a recombinant DNA vector of the type described hereinabove. Appropriate cells are then transformed with the recombinant DNA vector, cloned and grown under conditions sufficient for production of HAV cDNA. This cDNA can then be harvested from the clonal cell culture and used, as is, or further modified for certain applications. In a particular embodiment, bacteria are modified by genetic engineering techniques to make such bacteria capable of producing HAV double stranded complementary DNA ds cDNA . In this method, HAV single stranded ss RNA is reverse transcribed to provide HAV ss cDNA which is extended to ds cDNA and then inserted into a bacterial plasmid to create a chimeric plasmid containing the nucleotide sequences defined hereinabove. The chimeric plasmid containing the ds cDNA is then inserted into bacterial cells by transforming the bacterial cells with the chimeric plasmid. Bacterial cells which have been so transformed can then be cloned and clonal cell lines grown in cell culture to replicate the chimeric plasmid. The HAV ds cDNA can then be recovered by enzymatically cleaving it from replicated chimeric plasmids. This method provides for the microbiological production of relatively large quantities of HAV cDNA at reasonable costs. The cDNA, in turn, can be employed in assays for the detection of HAV since HAV cDNA will bind specifically to HAV RNA. Such assays can be performed quickly and easily and they offer the potential for being extremely sensitive and specific for HAV virus detection. In a further aspect therefore, the present invention provides an assay for the detection of HAV in a sample eg. a sample selected from human physiological samples, laboratory animal physiology samples, environmental samples and tissue culture samples , comprising HAV cDNA can also be employed in the production of either HAV antigen or antibodies to such an antigen. In these methods, HAV cDNA is produced as described above. For antigen production, HAV cDNA capable of directing antigen synthesis is selected and inserted into cells capable of producing the antigen after which the cells are cultured under conditions suitable for antigen production and harvesting. An alternative method of antigen production is the synthesis of peptides, FIGURE 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating the production of a bacterial chimeric plasmid containing HAV ds cDNA FIGURE 2 is a block diagram illustrating one embodiment of an assay employing HAV cDNA produced according to the methods described herein FIGURE 3 shows the results of an alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis of cDNA from HAV RNA and poliovirus type 2 RNA FIGURE 4 illustrates the results of alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis of products of preparative HAV ds cDNA synthesis FIGURE 5 illustrates the results of hybridization of cloned cDNA insert probe to HAV RNA FIGURE 6 is a restriction map of HAV cDNA clones prepared according to this invention FIGURES 7A 7E illustrate the nucleotide sequence of cloned HAV cDNA and predicted amino acid sequence from near the genome 5 terminus to the end of the area corresponding to the capsid protein region of poliovirus RNA and FIGURES 8A and 8B illustrate the nucleotide sequence of cloned HAV cDNA and predicted amino acid sequence corresponding to the RNA polymerase region of poliovirus RNA and the genome 3 terminus. The methods described herein for producing HAV cDNA employ fundamental gene splicing techniques which have been described in the scientific literature. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,227,224, issued to Stanley N. Cohen and Herbert W. Boyer, on December 2, 1980, describes many of these techniques. The teachings of the Cohen and Boyer patent, therefore, are incorporated herein by reference. A more specific description of the techniques which can be employed in producing HAV ds cDNA will now be presented in conjunction with Figure 1, a schematic diagram illustrating these techniques. HAV was isolated from human stool during a family outbreak in Australia and passaged twice in marmosets. This virus, present in a homogenate of liver tissue, was injected intravenously into marmosets that were monitored for HAV production by immunofluorescent antibody analysis of biopsied liver tissue. The animals were killed when maximum immunofluorescence was reached, at which time their livers were removed, minced, frozen, and subsequently homogenized prior to purification of HAV. Alternatively, HAV can be purified directly from homogenates of human stool or HAV infected tissue culture cells. When isolated from liver or stool, the bulk of extraneous tissue and debris can be removed by low speed centrifugation. Disruption of cellular membranes that may bind or contain HAV can be accomplished by extensive hydrocarbon extraction. Micrococcal nuclease can be used to digest and eliminate non encapsidated nucleic acids that might ultimately contaminate purified HAV RNA. The virus can be purified using successive steps of rate zonal and isopycnic density gradient centrifugation. Those skilled in the art will recognize that there are methods of purifying HAV that can be used alternatively or in conjunction with those above, such as gel filtration chromatography or ion exchange chromatography. HAV ss RNA can be extracted from the purified viral particles by digestion with sodium dodecyl sulfate NaDodSO₄ and proteinase K, followed by extraction with phenol and chloroform isoamyl alcohol. HAV ss RNA is then employed in the synthesis of HAV ds cDNA, as illustrated. Initially, the HAV ss RNA is reverse transcribed employing the enzyme reverse transcriptase, also known as RNA dependent DNA polymerase. See Kacian D.L. and Myers, J.C. 1976 The RNA template is then removed with alkali. The cDNA molecules are then placed in another reaction mixture containing Tris HCl buffer pH 7.5 , Mg S1 nuclease is then employed to cleave the loop at one end of the molecule. See Bhat and Piatigorsky 1975 , The ds cDNA can then be tailed with oligo dC at the 3 ends by employing terminal transferase and dCTP. See Boyer et al. 1977 in Recombinant Molecules Impact on Science and Society R. F. Beers and E. G. Bassett, eds. pp 9 20, Raven, N. Y. This produces ds cDNA having poly C at both ends to serve as sticky ends in subsequent binding to a cleaved bacterial plasmid in order to form a recombinant DNA molecule. The tailed ds DNA can be filtered by gel chromatography, and the largest fragments are then pooled from the eluted fractions. Plasmid pBR322 can be employed to illustrate chimeric plasmid formation. Plasmid pBR322 is a well characterized plasmid known to contain selectable markers. This plasmid contains one gene coding for tetracycline resistance as well as a gene coding for ampicillin resistance. Since the HAV ds cDNA sequences are inserted into the gene for ampicillin resistance, successfully transformed bacterial cells are ampicillin sensititve Amp Plasmid pBR322 is cleaved using the restriction enzyme The oligo dG tailed plasmid DNA and the oligo dC tailed HAV ds cDNA are than hybridized in solution. This can be accomplished by mixing these DNA species in an equimolar ratio in 0.1 The hybridized plasmid HAV ds cDNA is then inserted into To establish the identity of a cloned cDNA, it can be hybridized to RNA from cells, including cells infected with HAV. Inserted cDNA can be isolated from plasmids by digestion with Those skilled in the art will recognize, of course, that other materials and conditions can be employed other than those specifically described in the aforementioned embodiments. For example, it is clear that bacterial cells other than Similarly, although bacterial plasmids have been employed in producing HAV cDNA sequences, other recombinant DNA vectors could be employed. Examples of other recombinant DNA vectors include phages, animal viruses and yeast vectors. Hosts which allow the recombinant DNA vector to multiply are chosen, of course. One significant use for HAV cDNA produced according to this invention is in assays to detect the presence of HAV RNA. In a typical assay for HAV, for example, a patient sample, such as a stool specimen, can be assayed as illustrated in Figure 2. The RNA fraction of the patient sample is first isolated, which can be done by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. This RNA fraction need not be pure, but it must be a fraction which would contain HAV RNA if HAV were present in the original sample. HAV cDNA is first labeled, e.g., with a radioactive material such as tritium, iodine, or ³²P, and subsequently incubated with the RNA fraction under conditions to allow the labeled HAV cDNA to bind to HAV RNA, if present. After incubation, unbound labeled HAV cDNA is separated and bound labeled HAV cDNA is then detected in a scintillation counter or by other means. Other patient samples, of course, such as a biopsy, might be employed. Additionally, the assay can be performed on other samples which might contain HAV, such as sewerage, water or shellfish suspected to be contaminated. A solid phase assay, although not illustrated, might be performed. Additionally, the label need not be a radioactive isotope, but might be an enzyme, optical label, etc. In particular, it is believed that dot blots of stool extracts hybridized with HAV cDNA probe will provide a sensitive and easily performed assay for the presence of HAV. Such dot blots have been described. See Thomas, Research laboratories studying HAV could employ HAV cDNA probes for detecting or quantitating HAV RNA in specimens such as cells or fluid from tissue culture, tissues and stool from experimentally infected primates, and specimens collected from patients. In the case of intact cells, the assay might be an Another significant use for HAV cDNA produced according to this invention is in the production of HAV antigens. Antigenic proteins can be produced by reverse transcribing HAV RNA to provide cDNA, inserting the cDNA into a recombinant DNA vector and transforming cells in which said recombinant DNA vector can multiply. Transformed cells can then be cloned to produce a cell line capable of replicating the cDNA. The cell line can be cultured under conditions sufficient for the production of cDNA and cDNA can then be harvested from the cell culture. Specific cDNA could be selected and isolated which was capable of directing antigen synthesis in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells and subsequently inserted into such cells so that these cells produce antigen. Alternatively, antigenic peptides can be synthesized Antigen produced by the methods described above could be used to immunize a host, such as an animal, and cause that host to produce antibodies against HAV or a portion thereof. If desired, antibody producing cells could be employed to produce cell lines capable of producing monoclonal antibodies. Polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies would be useful reagents for laboratories involved in the study of HAV. Also, harvested antigen capable of eliciting protective anti HAV in humans could be an effective means of vaccination. For example, a capsid protein produced from a suitable cell could possess sufficient antigenic properties for use in a vaccine against HAV, as has been demonstrated for a strain of foot and mouth disease virus FMDV , another member of the picornavirus group. See, Kleid, D.G., et al. The invention is further and more specifically illustrated by the following examples. The HM 175 strain of HAV was isolated from a family outbreak in Australia. See, Daemer, R. J., Feinstone, S. M., Gust, I. D. Purcell, R. H. 1981 HAV was also passaged 6 times in marmosets and 19 times in secondary African green monkey kidney AGMK monolayers which were used as a source of RNA for hybridization. Infected cultures were harvested at 21 days when 100 of the cells exhibited maximal immunofluorescence. RNA for hybridization studies was prepared from uninfected and HAV infected AGMK cells by isolation of total cytoplasmic RNA. See, Maniatis, T., Fritsch, E. F. Sambrook, J. 1982 The yield of virion RNA from eight marmoset livers was approximately 1.0 ug and the A₂₆₀ A₂₈₀ ratio was 2.0. HAV RNA derived from liver or AGMK culture yielded a series of transcripts ranging in size from slightly smaller than the longest poliovirus type 2 cDNA to less than 500 nucleotides Fig. 3, lanes a, b, and b lanes e and e show poliovirus type 2 cDNA . Presumably, degradation of HAV RNA prevented more extensive synthesis of reverse transcript approaching the expected full length of 7500 nucleotides. Other HAV cDNAs in Fig. 3 lanes c and d revealed evidence of more extensive RNA degradation, but all gave a similar banding pattern which was different from that of poliovirus cDNAs. The effect of varying several chemical constituents and physical parameters on yield and length of HAV cDNA was analyzed by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis and incorporation of ³²P dCMP into trichloroacetic acid precipitable product. Incubation for 30 min, with 120 units ml reverse transcriptase, or with 100 mM KCl increased size and quantity of cDNA when compared to that shown in Fig. 3, lane b . Denaturation of HAV RNA was not attempted because quantity was limited and, in earlier experiments, heat or methyl mercury treatment of poliovirus RNA decreased yield and size of cDNA. Preparative conditions for HAV cDNA synthesis were based on findings in the analytical experiments described above. HAV RNA 0.8 ug derived from marmoset liver served as a template for cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase 120 units ml for 30 min at 42.5 C in 160 ul that contained 50 mM Tris HCl pK 8.3 10 mM MGCl₂ 100 mH KCl 500 uM each dATP, ³²P dCTP 0.025 Ci mmol , dGTP, and TTP 1 mM dithioerythritol 4 mM sodium pyrophosphate 30 ug ml oligo dT₁₂ The second strand of cDNA was synthesized for 30 min at 37 C using the large Klenow fragment of After phenol extraction, column chromatography, and ethanol precipitation, double stranded cDNA ds cDNA was digested for 1 hr at 37 C using 10 units ml nuclease S1 0.1 units of S1 per ng ds cDNA in 30 mM NaOAc pH 4.5 , 0.3 M NaCl, 3 mM ZnCl₂, and 5 vol vol glycerol, followed by addition of EDTA to 35 mM, phenol and ether extraction, and dialysis against 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 and 1 mM EDTA. Products of preparative HAV ds cDNA synthesis were analyzed by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis and the results are shown in Fig. 4 lane a, approximately 3 ng cDNA lane b, approximately 2 ng ds cDNA prior to nuclease S1 digestion lane c, approximately 2 ng ds cDNA after nuclease S1 digestion. Migration of Homopolymer tails of dCMP were added to ds cDNA using 250 units ml terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase for 20 minutes at room temperature in 100 ul that contained 0.14 M potassium cacodylate pH 7.2 , 1 mM CoCl₂ 0.2 mM dithioerythritol, 500 ug ml nuclease free bovine serum albumin, and 200 uM dCTP. After phenol extraction, 50 of ds cDNA was ether extracted and precipitated with ethanol. The remaining tailed ds cDNA was applied to a 3 ml column of Sepharose 4B in 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 , 0.6 M NaCl and 2 mM EDTA. See, Maniatis, T., Fritsch, E. F. Sambrook, J. 1982 Plasmid vector pBR322, cleaved at the Cloned cDNA inserts isolated from low melting point agarose were labelled by nick translation and used as probes in hybridization i to electrophoretically separated RNA bound to nitrocellulose paper described above for establishing the identity of cloned cDNA species, ii to DNA bound to nitrocellulose paper after lysis of bacterial colonies The identity of inserted DNAs in recombinant plasmids was established by hybridization to RNA bound to nitrocellulose paper after gel electrophoresis and the results are shown in Fig. 5. Nucleic acids were denatured and electrophoresed marker lanes a c were removed and stained with 2 ug ml ethidium bromide in 0.05 N NaOH for 40 min followed by 0.5 ug ml ethidium bromide in 40 mM Tris HOAc pH 7.8 , 1 mM EDTA for 15 min and destaining in the same buffer for 15 min. Lanes b e were transferred to nitrocellulose paper and hybridized for 36 hr at 42 C with 25 ng ml ³¹P pHAV A nick translated probe prepared from the insert of pHAV The restriction map shown in Fig. 6 is based on data obtained from digests and on hybridization of labelled inserts to fractionated DNA. Viral RNA is estimated to be 7450 nucleotides in length excluding 3 poly A which is shown at the right thicker line . A composite map of cloned HAV cDNA and positions of the inserts from clones pHAV Plasmids pHAV Extent of RNA sequence not represented in cDNA clones was determined by primer extension of HAV infected AGMK cytoplasmic RNA. Racaniello, V. R. and Baltimore, D., A labelled In Fig. 7 nucleotide sequence is presented from pHAV The sequence of cloned cDNA from pHAV RNA was extracted from African green monkey kidney AGMK monolayers, either uninfected or infected with HAV as described in Example 1. RNA was also extracted from fecal suspensions from marmosets that had been experimentally infected with the HM175 strain of HAV. RNA was also extracted from serum or fecal suspensions from humans infected with a variety of HAV strains. All solutions were treated with 0.1 diethyl pyrocarbonate prior to use. Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from uninfected and HAV infected AGMK cells. See Maniatis, T. et al. Samples were applied to nitrocellulose paper using the dot blot technique. See, Thomas, P.S., Plasmid pHAV Denatured DNA probe 10 ng ml was sealed in a plastic bag containing the nitrocellulose sheet with immobilized RNA and 50 vol vol formamide, 0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M trisodium citrate, 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.5 , 0.2 NaDodSO₄, denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA 100 ug ml , 0.04 each bovine serum albumin polyvinylpyrollidone Ficoll for 36 hr at 42 C. Unbound DNA probe was removed from the nitro cellulose paper by successive washes in 15 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM trisodium citrate, 0.1 NaDodSO₄ for 15 min at 50 C until samples of wash buffer assayed in a liquid scintillation counter indicated that no further removal of probe was taking place. X ray film was exposed to the nitrocellulose paper with an intensifying screen at 70 C for varying periods. When RNA from tissue culture was assayed, maximum sensitivity and specificity were obtained using a 17 hr exposure, when only samples from HAV infected cells indicated binding of probe. No probe bound to those RNA samples that were treated with ribonuclease. In one series of dilutions of RNA from HAV infected cells, probe binding was detectable with as little as 1 ng total cytoplasmic RNA. Since HAV RNA probably represents less than 1 of the total cytoplasmic RNA in an infected cell, approximately 10⁶ molecules were detected in this experiment. Results from marmoset and human samples of feces and serum showed that HAV RNA was detected with greater sensitivity than the detection of HAV by immune electron microscopy or by radiommunoassay. HAV RNA was detected to the level of approximately 1,000 chimpanzee infectious units from a variety of HAV strains. The following cell strains containing plasmids designated pHAV, have been deposited at The American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD The invention described herein is useful in the production of HAV cDNA by recombinant DNA techniques. HAV cDNA is in turn useful in assays for the detection of HAV, in the production of viral antigens, and in the production of antibodies against such antigens.
