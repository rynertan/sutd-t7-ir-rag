# Process for producing graft copolymer.

## Abstract
A powdery graft copolymer is obtained by a process characterized in that a graft copolymer latex obtained by graft polymerizing hard polymer giving monomers to an elastic trunk polymer is mixed, after the coagulation of the latex or in the presence of a coagulant, with an organic liquid which is hardly soluble in water and does not dissolve but can wet the graft copolymer, in such a volume ratio that a dispersion wherein water forms a continuous dispersion medium phase and the volume ratio of the organic liquid to the graft polymer is 0.9 to 7.5 is formed, whereby the coagulated graft copolymer is impregnated with the organic liquid and dispersed in water, and then the dispersed copolymer particles are recovered from the water medium. According to this process, a graft copolymer having excellent powder char acteristics such as fluidity and particle size distribution can be obtained by the use of a small quantity of an organic liquid.
