# A vibration sensing probe.

## Abstract
A probe 1 for producing electrical signals in response to the vibrations of the machine is attachable to a stud mounted on the machine by a bayonet fastening. When attached to the machine an accelerometer 6 in the probe is held pressed against the stud by a helical spring 9 within the probe. Spurious oscillations of the coils of the spring are damped out by the use of a polyurethane potting compound in which the spring is embedded. The probe includes an electrical signal amplifier 13 for the signals from the ac celerometer. As an alternative to the bayonet attachment, the use of a transverse movement is mentioned.
