# Method for decontaminating a permeable subterranean formation.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a process for oxidizing a contaminant in a permeable subterranean formation char acterized by, introducing an aqueous treating solution into the formation, the aqueous treating solution comprising 0.1 to 20 hydrogen peroxide and from 1 to 100 kilograms of a hydratable polymeric material per cubic metre of aqueous treating solution to provide sufficient viscosity to modify the distribution of the aqueous treating solution wihin the subterranean formation to provide sufficient hydrogen peroxide proximate to the contaminant to oxidize the contaminant to a less objectionable form yet minimize the distribution of hydrogen peroxide to portions of the subterranean formation free from the contaminant.
