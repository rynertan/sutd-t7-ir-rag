# Stimulation of aerobic bacteria.

## Abstract
A process for stimulating the growth of aerobic bacteria by supplying a nutrient composition containing from 0.8 to 8 parts of a total nitrogen per part by weight of total phosphorus characterized by incorporating sufficient phos phorus as a condensed phosphorus moiety selected from a pyrophosphate moiety and a tripolyphosphate moiety whereby from 5 to 65 by weight of the combined orthophosphate moiety and the condensed phosphate moie ty in the composition is present as the condensed phosphate moiety. It also provides such a nutrient composition.
