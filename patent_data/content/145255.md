The mechanism comprises an arm 16 , a shaft 22 on which the arm is mounted for rotation about the horizontal axis and moving means for turning the arm about the axis. The moving means comprises a hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly 32 comprising a piston 36 , a first piston rod 38 making a screw threaded connection with an end cap 40 of the cylinder so that movement of the piston causes it to turn, and a second piston rod 44 connected to the arm to transmit rotation thereto.
