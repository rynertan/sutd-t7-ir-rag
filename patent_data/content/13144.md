The compounds of the invention are active as herbicides and therefore, in a further aspect the invention provides a process for severely damaging or killing unwanted plants which process comprises applying to the plants, or to the growth medium of the plants, an effective amount of a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined. Generally speaking the compounds of the invention are herbicidally effective against a variety of plants.However, certain of the compounds of the invention are selectively active against monocotyledonous plants, dicotyledonous plants being relatively unaffected by rates of appliçation of the compounds of the invention which are severely damaging or lethal to other plant species. Therefore, in yet a further aspect the invention provides a process for selectively controlling the growth of weeds in crops which process comprises applying to the crop, or to the growth medium of the crop, a compound of formula I, as hereinbefore defined, in an amount sufficient to severely damage or kill the weeds but insufficient to damage the crop substantially. The compounds of the invention may be applied directly to the plants post emergence application or to the soil before the emergence of the plants pre emergen e application . However, the compounds are, in general, more effective when applied to the plants post emergence. The compounds of formula I may be used on their own to inhibit the growth of, severely damage, or kill plants but are preferably used in the form of a composition comprising a compound of the invention in admixture with a carrier comprising a solid or liquid diluent. Therefore, in yet a further aspect the invention provides plant growth inhibiting, plant damaging, or plant killing compositions comprising a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined and an inert carrier therefor. Compositions according to the invention include both dilute compositions, which are ready for immediate use, and concentrated compositions, which require to be diluted before use, usually with water. Preferably the compositions contain from 0.01 to 90 by weight of the active ingredient. Dilute compositions ready for use preferably contain from 0.01 to 2 of active ingredient, while concentrated compositions may contain from 20 to 90 of active ingredient, although from 20 to 70 is usually preferred. The solid compositions may be in the form of granules, or dusting powders wherein the active ingredient is mixed with a finely divided solid diluent, eg kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, dolomite, calcium carbonate, talc, powdered magnesia, Fuller s earth and gypsum. They may also be in the form of dispersible powders or grains, comprising a wetting agent to facilitate the dispersion of the powder or grains in liquid. Solid compositions in the form of a powder may be applied as foliar dusts. Liquid compositions may comprise a solution or dispersion of an active ingredient in water optionally containing a surface active agent, or may comprise a solution or dispersion of an active ingredient in a water immiscible organic solvent which is dispersed as droplets in water. Surface active agents may be of the cationic, anionic, or non ionic type. The cationic agents are, for example, quaternary ammonium compounds eg cetyltrimethylammonium bromide . Suitable anionic agents are soaps salts of aliphatic mono esters of sulphuric acid, for example sodium lauryl sulphate and salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds, for example sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, sodium, calcium, and ammonium lignosulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate, and a mixture of the sodium salts of diisopropyl and triisopropylnaphthalenesulphonic acid. Suitable non ionic agents are the condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as oleyl alcohol and cetyl alcohol, or with alkylphenols such as.octyl or nonyl phenol or octylcresol.Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monolaurate the condensation products of the partial ester with ethylene oxide and the lecithins. The aqueous solutions or dispersions may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in water or an organic solvent optionally containing wetting or dispersing agent s and then, when organic solvents are used, adding the mixtures so obtained to water optionally containing wetting or dispersing agent s . Suitable organic solvents include, for example, ethylene dichloride, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, diacetone alcohol, toluene, kerosene, methylnapthalene, the xylenes trichioroethylene. The compositions for use in the form of aqueous solutions or dispersions are generally supplied in the form of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient, and the concentrate is then diluted with water before use. These concentrates are usually required to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage, to be capable of dilution with water to fÏrm aqueous preparations whlch remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. Concentraces conveniently contain 20 90 , preferably 20 70 , by weight of the active ingredient s .Dilute preparations ready for use may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient s depending upon the intended purpose amounts of 0.01 to 10.0 and preferably 0.1 to 2 , by weight of active ingredient s are normally used. A preferred form of concentrated composition comprises the active ingredient which has been finely divided and which has been dispersed in water in the presence of a surface active agent and a suspending agent. Suitable suspending agents are hydrophilic colloids and include, for example, polyvinylpyrrolidone and sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and the vegetable gums, for example gum acacia and gum tragacanth. Preferred suspendingagents are those which impart thixotropic properties.to, and increase the viscosity of the concentrate. Examples of preferred suspending agents include hydrated colloidal mineral silicates, such as montmorillonite, beidellite, nontronite, hectorite, saponite, and saucorite. Bentonite is especially preferred. Other suspending agents include cellulose derivatives and polyvinyl alcohol. The rate of application of the compounds of the invention will depend on a number of factors including, for example, the compound chosen for use, the identity of the plants whose growth is to be inhibited the formulation selected for use and whether the compound is to be applied for foliage or root uptake. As a general guide, however, an application rate of from 0.005 to 20 kilograms per hectare is suitable while from 0.05 to kilograms per hectare may be preferred The compositions of the invention may comprise, in addition to one our more compounds of the invention, one or more compounds not of the invention but which possess biological activity.For example, as herein before indicated the compounds of the invention are in general substantially more effective against monocotyledonous plants or grass species than against dicotyledonous plants or broad leaved species. As a result, in certain applications the herbicidal use of the compounds of the invention alone may be insufficient to protect a, crop. Accordingly in yet a still further embodiment the invention provides a herbicidal composition comprising a mixture of at least one herbicidal compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined with at least one other herbicide. The other herbicide may be any herbicide not having the formula I. It will generally be a herbicide having a complementary action. For example, one preferred class is of mixtures comprising a herbicide active against broad leaved weeds. A second preferred class is of mixtures comprising a contact herbicide.

Span 80 is a Trade Mark for a surface active agent comprising sorbitan monolaurate. Tween 20 is a Trade Mark for a surface active agent comprising a condensate of sorbitan monolaurate with 20 molar proportions of ethylene oxide.Each 5 ml emulsion containing a test compound was then diluted to 40 ml with water and sprayed on to young pot plants post emergence test of the species named in Table 5 below. Damage to test plants was assessed after 14 days on a scale of 0 to 5 where 0 is 0 to 20 damage and 5 is complete kill. In a test for pre emergence herbicidal activity, seeds of the test plants were sown in a shallow slit formed in the surface of soil in fibre trays. The surface was then levelled and sprayed, and fresh soil then spread thinly over the sprayed surface. Assessment of herbicidal damage was carried out after 21 days using the same scale of 0 to 5 as the post emergence test. In both cases the degree of herbicidal damage was assessed by comparison with untreated control plants. The results are given in Table 5 below. A dash means that no experiment was carried out.

SEP tb Example 34 This Example illlustrates the selective herbicidal activity of compounds f b the invention. The seeds of the test specs were sprinkled onto the surface of soil in seed boxes and covered with a thin layer of sand. The br ,r.es were lightly watered with an overhead spray and placed in a glasshouse for one week to permit germination of the seeds and plant growth to a height of 4 to 5 inches. The boxes were then removed from the glasshouse and sprayed with a composition of the invention prepares . described in Example 30. For comparison purposes at least one box containing one week old seedlings was sprayed lightly with water only.After spraying the boxes were returned to the glasshouse for a further 29 days after which the effect of the treatment was visually assessed. The tests were carried out in triplicate and the results, expressed as percentage damage, are recorded in Table 6. To assess the safety of the test compounds on the test crop plant species the crop plant species were tested at an application rate ten times higher than that used for the weed plant species.

The compounds were formulated for test by mixing an appropriate amount with 5 ml of an emulsion prepared by diluting 160 ml of a solution containing 21.8 g per litre of Span 80 and 78.2 g per litre of Tween 20 in methylcyclohexanone to 500 ml with water. Span 80 is a Trade Mark for a surface active agent comprising sorbitan monolaurate. Tween 20 is a Trade Mark for a surface active agent comprising a condensate of sorbitan monolaurate with 20 molar proportions of ethylene oxide. Each 5 ml emulsion containing a test compound was then dil.uted to 40 ml with water and sprayed on to young pot plants post emergence test of the species named inTable 7 below. Damage to test plants was assessed after 20 days on a scale of 0 to 9 whereo 0 is 0 to 10 and 9 is 90 to 100 kill. The tests were carried out in triplicate and the mean results are recorded in Table 7 below.The names of the test plants were as follows Sy Soyabean Amsoy Ct Cotton Deltapine Ec Echinocbloa crus galli Sh Sorghum halepense St Setaria viridis Dg Digitaria sanguinalis TABLE 7EMI74.1 tb Compound SEP Rate SEP Test SEP Plants tb SEP No SEP kg ha SEP Crops SEP Weeds tb SEP Sy SEP Ct SEP Ec SEP Sh SEP St SEP Dg tb SEP 21 SEP 0.08 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 5 SEP 9 SEP 8 SEP 5 tb SEP 53 SEP 0.08 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 9 SEP 8 SEP 7 SEP 4 tb SEP 54 SEP 0.08 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 5 SEP 9 SEP SEP 6 SEP 5 tb SEP 55 SEP 0.08 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP SEP 6 SEP 8 SEP 9 SEP 4 tb SEP 61 SEP 0.08 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 9 SEP 9 SEP 9 SEP 9 tb SEP 65 SEP 0.08 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 9 SEP 8 SEP 2 SEP 3 tb
