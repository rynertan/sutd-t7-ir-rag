# Process for making an axle.

## Abstract
A unitary tubular axe 12 is formed to include an end 18 having a support section 22 of a completely solid cross section located between a generally vertical kingpin bore 24 and a tubular intermediate portion 16 of the axle. Both ends 18 of the tube are formed with such an end construction to provide a unitary front axle for both wheels. Forming proceeds by initially reducing the size of the outer tube diameter at an end thereof while maintain ing roundness. Axial forging of the tube end preferably by a closed die having a semispherical closed end then pro vides an axle end having a solid cross section and a distal semispherical shape. Subsequent axial forging of the so lid tube end by another closed die then provides upper and lower projections 26, 28 in which upwardly and downwardly facing holes are then forged to increase the width thereof while leaving a web between inner ends of the holes. A final boring operation through the upper and lower projections along the respective holes thereof and through the web then provides the kingpin bore which is located on the opposite side of the solid support section from the intermediate tubular portion of the axle. Bending of the axle end provides an upwardly extending wing sec tion 20 from which the solid support section projects generally horizontally.
