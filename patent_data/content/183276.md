## Description
FLAME RETARDANT RESIN COMPOSITION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a flame retardant resin composition which is excellent in light resistance.Recently, the rapid trends towards office automation O.A. have been even more accelerated because of the development of various kinds of office appliances. Since almost all of these appliances have internal dielectric parts or portions, they are often required to be self extinguishing flame retardant when they are exported to foreign countries. In particular, it is necessary for those to the United States to satisfy the requirements in the UL Standards for flame retardancy.Further, most of these appliances are generally used indoors however, even indoors, they are sometimes directly or indirectly exposed to light which comes in through windows or to that from fluorescent lamps.Accordingly, the materials for these O.A. appliances are required to be not only self extinguishing but also excellent in light resistance.For the applications mentioned above, there have frequently been used, in very large quantities, polystyrene type resins which have been made flameretardant. Therefore, the process of preparing flame retardant polystyrene type resins has been described in a lot of prior art refernces, e.g., JapaneseUnexamined Patent Publicaitons No. 64258 1978 and No.65741 1983, Japanese Examined Patent Publication No.32898 1977, etc. However, the inventions disclosed in such prior art references were all intended for rendering the resins flame retardant or additionally heatresistant, and were greatly inferior with respect to light resistance. Therefore, conventionally, as measures to give light resistance to the resins, an ultraviolet light absorber and a light stabilizer have been generally added either alone or in combination. However, the addition of these agents, which still had little effect of improving light resistance, was problematic in practical use.As has been described hereinbefore, flame retardant formulations which are generally in use have suffered from the drawbacks of being inferior in light resistance.The object of the present invention is to overcome the above described drawback and to provide a resin composition which is not only flame retardant but also excellent in light resistance. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAs a result of extensive investigations, the present inventors have found that the halogenated compound A shown by the formula I has a light resistance improving effect as well as a flame retardant effect, and, moreover, that the light resistance of a polystyrene type resin composition is markedly improved by using such a compound in combination with a specific ultraviolet light absorber and or light stabilizer, thereby having completed the present invention.Namely, the flame retardant resin composition of the present invention comprises, per 100 parts by weight of a polystyrene type resin, A 5 to 32 parts by weight of one or more kinds of halogenated compounds of the general formula I EMI3.1 wherein RÃš represents a group Cl H2l in which l is an integer of 1 to 4 X represents a bromine atom and each of a and b represents an integer of 2 to 5, B 0 to 10 parts by weight of a chlorinated polyethylene with a chlorination degree of 25 to 40 per cent by weight, C 2 to 10 parts by weight of antimony trioxide, D 0.1 to 3 parts by weight of one or more kinds of the compounds of the general formulas II, III, IV and V EMI3.2 wherein R2 represents a group CmH2m l in which m is an integer of 1 to 18 and Y represents a hydrogen atom or a group SO3H EMI4.1 wherein R represents a group CnH2n 1 in which n is an integer of 1 to 4 and R4 represents a group CpH2p 1 in which p is an integer of 0 to 4,EMI4.2 wherein R5 represents a group CqH2q 1 in which q is an integer of 1 to 8, andEMI4.3 wherein R6 represents a group CrH2r 1 in which r is an integer of 1 to 3 R represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group and s represents an integer of 2 to 18, and E 0 to 30 parts by weight of one or more kinds of halogenated bisphenol type polycarbonate oligomers. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTSThe present invention will be described hereinafter in further detail.As polystyrene type resins which employed in the present invention, there may be mentioned co polymers derived from an aromatic vinyl compound as a principal unit such as a polystyrene, a styrene acrylonitrile copolymer, an a methylstyrene acrylonitrile copolymer, a styreneacrylonitrile methyl methacrylate copolymer, a phenylmaleimide styrene acrylonitrile copolymer, etc., and resins which have been prepared by rubber toughening them, e.g. a high impact polystyrene, an acrylonitrilebutadiene styrene copolymer, a methyl methacrylatebutadine styrene copolymer, an acrylonitrile acrylic acid butyl styrene copolymer. These polystyrene type resins can be used either alone or in combination, and can be prepared by emulsion polymerization, emulsion suspension polymerization, suspension polymerization, bulk polymerization, etc.In the present invention, the halogenated compound A of formula I not only exhibits a flame retardant effect but also have a light resistance improving effect. This light resistance improving effect of the halogenated compound is an effect which was discovered by the present inventors. As examples of such compounds, there may be mentioned 1,2 bis 2,4 dibromophenoxy ethane, 1,2 bis 2,4,6 tribromophenoxy ethane, 1,2 bis pentabromophenoxy ethane, etc. These can be used either alone or in combination. The amount of the halogenated compound A to be added is 5 to 32 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polystyrene type resin.If the amount of said compound A is less than 5 parts by weight, it is difficult to obtain a sufficient flame retardant effect, and if it is over 32 parts by weight, heat resistance is reduced greatly and the problem of adhesion to mold in molding, which results in deterioration in the appearance of a molded product, tends to occur.The halogenated compound A of formula I has been described in, for example, specifications of U.S. PatentsNos. 4,016,139 and 4,032,507.In general, the halogenated compounds A of formula I are produced by reacting a brominated phenol with a halogenated alkane having a carbon atom number of 1 to 4 at elevated temperatures in the presence of a basic material such as alkali metal hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates, oxides and hydrides. The preferred alkali metals are potassium and sodium.The chlorinated polyethylene B with a chlorination degree of 25 to 40 per cent by weight which is used in the present invention is intended for the improvement of flame retardancy and impact resistance, and this may be either crystalline or non crystalline. If the chlorination degree is beyond said range, the effect of improving flame retardancy and impact resistance tends to become hard to be achieved. The amount of chlorinated polyethylene B to be added is 0 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polystyrene type resin. In order to improve the impact strength of the present flame retardant resin composition, the amount of component B to be added is up to 10 parts by weight depending on the impact strength required. Due to the addition of component B , thermal stability shows a tendency to deteriorate slightly, and if the amount exceeds 10 parts by weight, this causes not only a very eat deterioration in thermal stability but also deterioration in heat resistance therefore it is not preferable.Next, antimony trioxide C in the present invention is used as flame retardant auxiliary, and the amount thereof to be added is 2 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polystyrene type resin. If the amount is less than 2 parts by weight, halogenated compound A of formula I to be added becomes necessitated in markedly greater amounts therefore this is not preferable.In the present invention, compound D of the formula II,III, IV, or V is intended for prevention of deterioration in light resistance of the resin composition by absorbing ultraviolet rays, and the amount of compound D to be added is 0.1 to 3 parts by weight, preferably 0.3 to 2 parts by weight. If the amount of compound D to be added is less than 0.1 part by weight, a sufficient light resistance cannot be obtained whereas if the amount is over 3 parts by weight, not only heat resistance deteriorates but also it is uneconomical therefore, these are not preferable. The compound D can be used either alone or in combinaiton so long as the amount to be added is within the above mentioned range.The halogenated bisphenol type polycarbonate oligomer E used in the present invention, which acts as flame retardant and in turn has the effect of improving heat resistance, is a compound shown by the following general formula VI or VII.EMI7.1 EMI8.1 wherein X represents a bromine atom, R8 represents an alkylene group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, a carbonyl group, a group 0 , a group S or a group SO2 , dl to d6 may be the same or different and each represent an integer of 1 to 4, el and e2 may be the same or different and each represent an integer of 1 to 5, and f, g and h represent the number of repeating units, which are integers of 1 to 50, respectively. The amount of the halogenated bisphenol type polycarbonate oligomer E to be added is 0 to 30 parts, preferably 4 to 30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polystyrene type resin.The process for preparing the halogenated bisphenol type polycarbonate oligomer E is described in JapaneseUnexamined Patent Publication No. 65741 1983, according to which the oligomer E can be obtained by reacting a halogenated bisphenol compound with phosgene or by reacting a bisphenol compound with a brominated phenol compound.Further, to the composition of the present invention, generally used phenol series, phosphite series, thioether series, tin series compounds and other stabilizers, lubricants, fillers, dyes, pigments, etc. can be optionally added. The preparation method of the present composition is not particularly limited and the composition can be easily prepared by known mixing methods, using known shaping devices.Hereinafter, the effects of the present invention will be described in detail on the basis of the followingExamples and Comparative Examples.Examples 1 9, Comparative Examples 1 11Per 100 parts by weight of an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene compolymer resin DIAPE z ABS 7001 trademark, high impact ABS resin manufactured by Mitsubishi RayonCo., Ltd. , A 1,2 bis 2,4,6 tribromophenoxy ethane, B chlorinated polyethylene G 235 chlorination degree 35 wt manufactured by Osaka Soda Co., Ltd. , C antimony tr ioxide, D1 2 hydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone FormulaII , D2 2 2 hydroxy 5 methylphenyl benzotriazole Formula III , D3 para octylphenylsalicylate FormulaIV and D4 bis 2,2,6,6, tetramethyl 4 piperidyl sebacate Formula V were mixed in proportions shown inTable 1 by means of a Henschel mixer, followed by shaping by means of a 40 mm single screw vented extruder.Further, as stabilizers, calcium laurate and dibutyltin laurate were added in amounts of 0.5 part by weight, respectively.Next, from the pellets obtained were prepared lightresistance test pieces 40 x 50 x 3 mm and UL burning test pieces 5 x 1 2 x 1 12 , 130 x 23 x 2 mm by means of a 2 oz. 56 g injection molder, and Izod impact test peices 2 1 2 x 1 2 x 1 4 , 64 x 23 x 6 mm notched and Vicat softening temperature measuring test pieces 15 x 15 x 6 mm by means of a 1 oz. 28 g injection molder.The results are also shown in Table 1. As is clear from Table 1, in the case of the use of conventional generally used flame retardants, deterioration in light resistance is great i.e. hE is great , whereas in the case of the present composition, not only the balance of impact resistance and heat resistance is excellent but also light resistance is satisfactory.
