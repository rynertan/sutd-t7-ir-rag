A first layer M1 20 22 of chrome copper chrome is applied to a ceramic substrate 19 and the circuits etched. A polyimide layer 23 is then applied, cured, and developed and etched to provide via holes in the polyimide layer down to the M1 circuitry. The top chrome 22 is now etched to expose the M1 copper 21 in the via holes. Next, a coating of tin 27 is applied to all exposed copper surfaces. This is followed by evaporation of a second layer M2 24 26 of chrome copper chrome and during the evaporation cycle, the tin is in a molten state which causes the chrome to break up as it is deposited and migrates some of the chrome to the periphery of the vias. As a result, a tin interface is formed which provides a metallurgical bond between the M1 copper 21 and the M2 copper 25 .

## Description
MULTILAYER INTEGRATED CIRCUIT SUBSTRATE STRUCTURE ANDPROCESS FOR MAKING SUCH STRUCTURESMCP or metallized ceramic polyimide integrated circuit substrate structures comprise a ceramic substrate on which is evaporated a first layer M1 of chrome copper chrome, on which printed circuitry is formed on the copper, a layer of polyimide, and a second evaporated layer M2 of chromecopper chrome, on which printed circuitry is formed on the copper. Via holes are formed in the polyimide, prior to the deposition of the M2 layer, which extend down to the copper circuitry of the M1 layer and which conductively connect the circuitry on the M1 and M2 layers.The above basic structure has presented problems in that there is no solubility of copper in chrome and, as a result, in the vias the bond between the copper of the M1 layer and the chrome of the M2 layer is a mechanical bond or coupling. Also, the top chrome of layer M1 is removed chemically at the bottom of the vias leaving copper which is exposed to air prior to the deposition of the M2 layer which results in oxidation. As such, this bonding system which depends entirely on a mechanical coupling and is extremely sensitive to film oxidation and or contaminants at the metal to metal interface did not provide the desired adhesion and also created undue electrical resistance in the vias.Subsequently, it was proposed to modify the above process to improve the inter connection between the M1 and M2 layers by employing an immersion gold solution. This modification is described in the IBM Technical DisclosureBulletin, Vol. 22, No. 4, September 1979, pages 1420 1421.The gold solution is applied immediately prior to evaporation of the M2 layer. During evaporation of the M2 layer of chrome copper chrome, the gold forms a metal to metal bond with the M1 copper layer and it also penetrates through theM2 bottom porous chrome layer to make contact with the M2 copper layer. This process provides good adhesion between the M1 and M2 layers and also provides a desirable via resistance, however, it proved to be expensive and time consuming. The process requires that each substrate be immersed in the gold solution bath for approximately 45 minutes and the cost of processing is quite high. In the processing of large quantities of substrates, it became evident that there was need for a process which was less time consuming and less costly and which would still provide the desired adhesion and via resistance.The present invention solves this problem. It greatly reduces the processing time and cost of the aforementioned prior art by providing the desired adhesion between the M1 and M2 layers and the desired via resistance. This is accomplished by using an immersion tin solution in the above described process instead of gold to make the interconnection between the M1 and M2 layers. The top chrome of layer M1 is removed chemically at the bottom of the vias in the substrates to expose the copper. A hot de ionized bath is used to wet all the exposed copper surfaces and then an immersion tin bath is used to apply tin to all of the exposed copper surfaces. The thickness of the tin is controlled by the length of time the substrates are in the bath.The substrates are then rinsed in hot de ionized water to remove any residue and air dried to remove the moisture.The M2 layer of chrome copper chrome is now evaporated on the tin at 3000C in a vacuum. During the evaporation cycle, the tin, which melts at around 2320C, goes into a molten state which causes the chrome to break up as it is de posited. When the bottom chrome of the M2 layer is evaporated, it actually condenses on the liquid tin. This has the effect of interrupting the continuity of the chrome film at this interface because movement of the molten tin disrupts the chrome film nucleation and surface cohesive effects cause some of the depositing chrome to migrate to the periphery of the vias. Voids are created in the chrome which results in very good diffusion and bond between the tin and the M1 and M2 copper layers.An advantage in using tin as an interface is that it is more feasible than gold, for example, to apply and it can be applied with a thickness substantial enough to leave a rough surface which breaks up the M2 bottom chrome layer when it is evaporated thereon. Another significant advantage in the use of tin is that it greatly reduces process time and cost. Tin immersion can be done in larger batches and only requires from 3 to 5 minutes immersion time per substrate. Also, the tin process substantially reduces the cost per substrate down to approximately one tenth of the cost using the prior art process.Thus, the present invention provides a more feasible and economical process for making via connections in multilayer integrated circuit substrates.Also, the present invention provides a multilayer integrated circuit substrate having a first layer of chromecopper chrome, a layer of polyimide, a second layer of chrome copper chrome, and via connections having a tin interface bonded between the copper of said first and second layers.Details of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular description of an embodiment of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 illustrates in cross section a prior art conductive via connection in a multilayer integrated circuit substrate and Fig. 2 illustrates in cross section a conductive via connection in a multilayer integrated circuit substrate, prepared by the method of the present invention.Referring to Fig. 1, there is illustrated the previously mentioned prior art multilayer integrated circuit substrate having a gold inter connection between the M1 and M2 circuit line layers of chrome 11, copper 12, and chrome 13.Over the M1 layer of chrome 13 is a layer of polyimide 14 and on the polyimide is an M2 circuit line layer of chrome 15, copper 16, and chrome 17. Prior to the application of the M2 circuit line layer, via holes are etched in the polyimide down through the top chrome 13 of the M1 layer.Next an immersion gold solution is applied to the base of the vias to provide a layer of gold 18 on the copper 12 of the M1 layer. The M1 and M2 circuit line layers are applied by evaporation and when the M2 layer is evaporated, the gold 18 diffuses through the porous bottom chrome 15 of theM2 layer and forms a metal to metal bond between the copper 16 of the M2 layer and the copper 12 of the M1 layer. The gold is put on in an electroless bath and is not in liquid form when the M2 layer is evaporated. The gold layer is very thin with a thickness in the order of 2500 ing stroms compared to the thickness of the copper which is around 80 000 ingstroms. The gold migrates down to form a good bond with the copper 12 of the M1 layer but a much lesser bond with the copper 16 of the M2 layer. It adheres well to the copper but will not adhere to the chrome.Referring now to Fig. 2, there is illustrated the present improved via hole arrangement in a multilayer integrated circuit substrate. The circuit substrate is similar to the above described prior art except that a tin interconnection is used between the copper of the M1 and M2 circuit line layers instead of gold. As will be described, the use of tin provides certain advantages.This arrangement also comprises a ceramic substrate 19 on the surface of which is an M1 circuit line layer of chrome 20, copper 21, and chrome 22. Over the M1 layer of chrome 22 is a layer of polyimide 23 and on the polyimide is an M2 circuit line layer of chrome 24, copper 25, and chrome 26.Prior to the application of the M2 circuit line layer, via holes are etched in the polyimide down through the top chrome 22 of the M1 layer. Next, an immersion tin solution is applied to the base of the vias to provide a layer of tin 27 on the copper 21 of the M1 layer.As was previously pointed out, the use of tin is more feasible, more economical, and requires less process time.Also, a layer of a greater thickness may be applied which is in the order of 40 000 ingstroms or half the thickness of the copper. The tin is thick enough to have a rough surface and it will cover all of any chrome specs and oxides which may be at the bottom of the vias. The tin bath is also an acidic bath which etches chrome and helps to clean the vias when the tin is deposited.The M1 and M2 circuit line layers are applied by evaporation and when the M2 layer is evaporated at 3000C, the tin layer 27 goes into a molten state and has a thickness sufficient enough to cause the bottom chrome 22 of the M2 layer to break up into particles 28, some of which migrate to the periphery of the via. The chrome 22 thickness, when applied, is in the order of 800 Angstroms. As a result of this action, there is excellent diffusion between the tin and the copper in both the M1 and M2 layers and a good metal to metal bond is created.The present via hole arrangement and multilayer integrated circuit substrate, shown in Fig. 2, is process in the following manner 1 The M1 layer of chrome copper chrome is evaporated on the raw ceramic substrate by commercially available equipment wherein a pool of chrome and a pool of copper are contained and an electron beam is used to fire and melt the pools at 3000C causing them to evaporate upward onto the substrate. 2 Circuitization is now carried out through the use of conventional photolithography and circuits are etched on the M1 metallurgy. 3 Following circuitization, the polyimide layer 23 is applied to the surface by spraying. 4 After applying the polyimide to the substrate, the material is partially cured A cure at 1100C for 15 minutes. The purpose of this operation is to remove excess solvent. 5 The polyimide then goes through a control bake cycle B cure at 2100C for 15 minutes to stabilize the material. 6 A photoresist is applied, exposed and developed so that the via sites are exposed. 7 The vias are selected and etched in the polyimide. A via at this point in time is a hole in the polyimide down to the M1 circuitry. 8 The polyimide now goes through the final cure cycle C cure at 3600C for 30 minutes. At this point the polyimide can no longer be etched. 9 The top chrome 22 of the M1 layer is etched to expose the copper 21 at the base of the via holes. 10 During the C cure cycle, the exposed M1 circuitry is oxidized. To remove this oxide coating, the substrates go through a series of cleaning steps. 11 The next cycle is the immersion tin cycle wherein a A hot de ionized water bath is used to wet all the copper surfaces on the substrates. b An immersion tin bath is used to apply tin to all exposed copper surfaces. The thickness of the tin is controlled by the length of time the substrates are in the bath and, as was mentioned, in the present embodiment the immersion time is from 3 5 minutes to deposit a layer of tin having a thickness of 40 000 Angstroms. c The substrates are then rinsed in hot de ionized water to remove any residue. d The substrates are then air dried to remove the moisture. 12 The M2 layer of chrome copper chrome is now evaporated at 300 0C in the same manner that the M1 layer was, with the bottom chrome of the M2 layer having a thickness in the order of 800 Angstroms. The tin melts at approximately 0 232 C and goes into a molten state which breaks up the M2 chrome into the particles 28 which results in the improved interface between the tin and the M1 and M2 copper layers. 13 The desired circuitry is now developed on the M2 metallurgy in the same manner that the M1 circuitry was fabricated. In multilayer integrated circuit substrates of the type shown and described, the M1 and M2 circuit lines are connected to via connections, as shown in Fig. 2, and also to circuit lands and I O or input output pins. The ceramic substrate contains pin holes which are not covered by the evaporated M1 and M2 circuit layers. Subsequently, the top chrome of the M2 layer is etched around selected pin hole locations to the copper to provide a copper ring or collar around the holes. Input output pins are then secured in the holes and tin applied to provide a good electrical connection. The circuit lands are formed by etching away the top chrome of the M2 layer over the via, shown in Fig. 2, and filling the via with tin lead to provide a land to which an integrated circuit chip may be soldered.
