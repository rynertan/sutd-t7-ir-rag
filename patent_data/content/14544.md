# Synthesis of mordenite and mordenite so synthesized.

## Abstract
A process for synthesizing mordenite in which the form of the crystals, such as their shape, size, smoothness or dis creteness is determined by including an organic basic nit rogen compound such as an amine or quaternary ammonium compound in an otherwise conventional mordenite forming reaction mixture.
