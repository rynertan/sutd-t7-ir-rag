For example, they prolong the functional refractory period in the left guinea pig atrium at a concentration of from 10 6 to 10 4 M of the compounds in accordance with the principles of N. Reute and E.Heeg Arch.Pharmahol.208 1971 323 333 . The compounds are therefore indicated for use as antiarrhythmic agents, e.g. for the treatrent of heart rhythm disorders such as heart flutter. The compounds also exhibit o adrenoceptor blocking activity, as indicated bv standard tests. For example, the inhibition of a adrenoceptors may be observed in insolated spiral strips of Vena femoralis of dogs E. Müller Schweinitzer and E. Stürmer, Br.J.Pharmacol. 1974 51, 441 446 at a bath concentration of from about 10 7 to t.o about 10 5 M. The compounds are therefore indicated for use as alpha adrenoceptor blocking agents, e.g. for the prophylaxis and treatment of disorders related to a paralysis of intestine motility, such as paralytic ileus. The compounds having a cyanc or carbamoyl group in the 2 position of the indole ring, especially a cyano group,possess ss adrenoceptor bloking activity, as indicated by standard tosts.For example, in the insolade, spontaneously beating quinea pig atrium Method of K. Saameli,Boly.Physiol.Acta 25 1967 CR 219 CR 221 inhibition of the positive inotropic cffect of adrenaline is observed at a bath concen tration of about 10 9 to about 10 6 M. These compounds are therefore indicated for use as ss adrenoceptor blocking agents, e.g. for the prophy laxis and treatment of coronary diseases such as Angina pectoris, of conditions resulting from sympathetic overstimulation, such as nervous heart ailments, ofEMI18.1 EMI18.2 ryocardial infarct, for interval migraine treatment, and for the treatmenr of glaucoma and thyreotoxicosis. It will be appreciated that it may be necessary to convert a compound having a substituted hydroxy group in the 2 position of the 3 arninopropoxy side chain to the coresponding free hydroxy compounds prior to carrying out the tast indicated above for shewing alpha and ss adrenoceptor bloking activity. The compounds of formula Ib exihibit more beneficial propertics than would be expected for compounds of this type, for example, ss adrenoceptor blockade intho case of the 2 cyano or 2 carbamoyl compounds, especially the 2 cyano compounds,freedom, from undesirable side effects, longs duration of activity, etc. For the above mentioned uses the dosage will, of course, vary depending on the compound employed, mode of administration and treatment desired.However, in general, satisfactory results are obtainod when administered at a daily dosage of from about 0. 1 mg to about 1000mg, and dosage forms suitable for oral administration comprise from about 0.25 mg tc about 500 mg of the compounds admixed with a solid cr liquid pharmaceutical carrier or diluent. examples of daily doses are from 0.1 to 100 ing In general, the 2 S optical isomers of the com, pounds are ore active than the 2 R optical isomers as ss adrenoceptor blocking agents. The compounds may be administered in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form. Such salt forms exhibit the same order of actiity as the free forms and are readily prepared in conventional manner. The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprosing a compound of the invention in free form or in pharmaceutically accetable salt form, in association with a pharmaceutical carrier or diluant. Such compositions may be in the form of, for example, a tablet.
