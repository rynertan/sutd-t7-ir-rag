# Process for treating and recovering pickling waste liquids for stainless steel.

## Abstract
A process for treating and recovering pickling waste liquids used for the pickling of stainless steel such as nitric hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid and, sulfuric acid is disclosed, which comprises recovering the nitric hydrofluoric acid and the iron oxide or metallic ion from the waste liquids of nitric hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid by two solvent extraction processes and recovering the Cr and Ni containing ferrite from the waste liquids of sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid by a ferrite formation process. When the waste acid is sulfuric acid, gypsum of a high purity can be obtained.
