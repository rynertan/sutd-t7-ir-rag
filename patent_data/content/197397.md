## Description
The present invention relates to a method for bonding ceramics to a metal. Particularly, it relates to a method for bonding which is suitable for bonding of structural parts of a machine, electronic parts or the like. British Patent No. 761045 discloses a method for bonding alumina to a metal. This method comprises oxidizing copper, placing the oxidized copper cuprous oxide Cu₂O on a ceramic substrate, heating the both at a temperature higher than the melting point of copper 1083 C and lower than the melting point of the copper oxide 1230 C to form copper oxide on the copper and reacting a eutectic crystal consisting of copper oxide and liquid copper with the substrate to thereby bond the alumina to the metal. The above method requires heating the components at a high temperature higher than 1083 C and lower than 1230 C, so that the difference in thermal expansion between alumina and a metal causes thermal stress when cooling the bonded components. Therefore, the alumina tends to crack, thus bringing about lowering of reliability with respect to strength. What is worse, the metal is distorted when heated. U.S. Patent No. 4037027 discloses a method characterized by heating components at a low temperature at which an inserting material is not melted and pressing them, i.e., a solid phase bonding method. According to this method, no large thermal stress is generated, because the heating temperature is low. However, because the inserting material is not melted and an oxide layer is formed on the surface of the inserting material, the reaction between the inserting material and components to be bonded is slow, so that a high bond strength is difficultly obtained for a short time. Further, a high pressure is required to contact the bonding surfaces with each other tightly. In the EP A O 135 937 there is disclosed a method of bonding a member made of alumina to another member of metal comprising bonding the alumina and the metal together by heating and pressing with an interlayer being interposed between the respective surface of said alumina and said metal which are to be bonded, said method further comprising employing aluminum or an aluminum base alloy as said interlayer. The CA 103 165153k discloses only the bonding between tin and SiC by inserting an Al or Al alloy between them and hot pressing. The Al alloy may be Al Si Mg alloy. The present invention aims at providing a method for bonding ceramics to a metal, said method being characterized by lowering joining temperature to thereby depress the generation of thermal stress in cooling bonded components. Therefore according to the method of the present invention, the ceramic hardly tends to crack, so that reliability with respect to strength is enhanced. The present invention aims at providing a method for bonding ceramic to a metal, characterized in that the bonding is carried out at a low temperature with a low bonding pressure to thereby depress thermal distortion of a metal, thus obtaining a product of a high dimensional accuracy. To attain the above objects, the method of the present invention comprises placing a sheet comprising a core piece made of pure aluminum or its alloy and surfaces made of an aluminum silicon magnesium alloy as an inserting material between SiAlON or Si₃N₄ and the metal and carrying out the bonding at a bonding temperature higher than the solidus of the aluminum silicon alloy and lower than the melting point of aluminum or its alloy at which the aluminum silicon magnesium alloy is melted but neither aluminum nor its alloy is melted , while pressurizing the inserting material. The bonding is preferably carried out in vacuum or in an inert gas atmosphere. Aluminum or its alloy has a melting point of 660 C or below. Therefore, even if the bonding is carried out at a temperature higher than the melting point, thermal stress will be generated in cooling only in the temperature range of from the melting point to a room temperature, thus the temperature drop being small. Further aluminum or its alloy has a very low yield point, so that thermal stress generated in cooling is relaxed by the yielding of aluminum or its alloy. For these reasons, the generation of thermal stress in ceramic is remarkably depressed, thus preventing the breakage of ceramic, which frequently occurs in the prior art. The Figure is a diagram showing an example of bonding the ceramic shafts to a metal according to the method of the present invention. As shown in Figure 1, a three layer clad plate 3 having a thickness of 0.6 mm comprising a core piece 4 made of an aluminum alloy Al 1 Mn alloy having a thickness of 0.5 mm and two surfaces 5 made of Al Si Mg alloy Al 10 Si 2 Mg and having a thickness of 0.05 mm was inserted between a shaft 1 made of SiAlON having a diameter of 10 mm and a shaft 2 made of Cr Mo steel having a diameter of 10 mm . The resulting structure was maintained at a bonding temperature of 600 C with a bonding pressure 1.0 kg f mm² for 15 minutes under a vacuum of 10 ⁴ Torr to bond the both shafts. The above Al Si Mg alloy had a melting point of about 585 C. Accordingly, only the both surfaces 5 of the clad plate 3 were melted at the bonding temperature of 600 C, so that the aluminum and silicon were reacted with the SiAlON and iron thereby completely join the sialon shaft 1 to the Cr Mo steel shaft 2 via the clad plate 3 metallurgically. The magnesium served to enhance the wetting power of the molten Al Si alloy against the sialon and iron. No cracks were observed in the bonding area and the bond strength was 14 kg f mm². The bond strength four point bending test of the shafts 1 and 2 joined in this Example was about 10 kg f mm² and the position of breakage was the bonding surface between the shaft 2 and the clad plate 3. Precisely, the intermetallic compound of Al with Fe was fragile to cause the breakage at this position. Accordingly, to further enhance the bond strength, it is preferred that a material exhibiting a low thermal expansion is inserted between the shaft 2 and the clad plate 3. If the bonding is carried out at a temperature of 620 C or above, the intermetallic compound formed by the reaction of Fe with Al Fe₃Al, Fe₂Al₅ will be thick to lower the bond strength. Therefore, the bonding temperature must be lower than 620 C. On the other hand, no lowering of bonding strength was observed, when bonding pressure was reduced to 0.1 kg f mm² or enhanced to 2 kg f mm². The bonding of a shaft made of Si₃N₄ to a shaft made of Cr Mo steel was carried out according to the same procedure as the one described in Example 1. The bond strength was about 8 kg f mm².
