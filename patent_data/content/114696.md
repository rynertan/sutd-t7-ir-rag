## Abstract
A method and a device for exhaust emission control for diesel engines including a trap 12 in the form of a filter formed of heat resting material for catching carbon particu lates. The trap has no directional effect with respect to air permeability, and combustion gas for heating the trap or a fuel for activating a catalyst provided to the trap is supplied to the trap from a direction which is substantially perpendi cular to a direction in which an exhaust gas flows from the engine to the trap. Thus, then obturation of the trap occurs as a result of accumulation of the trapped carbon particles, such particulate material can be readily removed by oxidation treatment, to thereby enable regeneration of the trap to be effected with a high degree of efficiency.
