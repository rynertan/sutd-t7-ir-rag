# Waterproof packing.

## Abstract
A low friction, water and steam resistant packing suit able for both static and dynamic applications, in which the packing includes inorganic fiber selected from the group consisting of chemical, electrical, structural and alkali resis tant glasses, ceramic, quartz, carbon and graphite materi als and dispersed and dried but unsintered polytetrafluo roethylene TFE . The packing is essentially free of wetting agent. The packing may additionally include dispersed graphite and an organic fiber sufficiently stable thermally to withstand the temperature necessary to decompose wetting agent initially present in the dispersed TFE.
