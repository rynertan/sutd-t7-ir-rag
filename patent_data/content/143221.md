# Method of encapsulating volatile organic liquids.

## Abstract
A method of encapsulating organic liquids for control led volatilization and release is described, which comprises in one embodiment charging a fine silica into a mixing container which does not inflict shearing stress to the con tents and adding the liquid having a viscosity of 50 centi poise or less at 25 C onto and mixing with the fine silica in the mixing container.
