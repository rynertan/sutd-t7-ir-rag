# MULTIPLE LAYER SHEET MATERIALS

## Abstract
The invention is in an improved multiple layer packaging sheet material which can be formed into closed and sealed packages suitable for holding products containing substantial fractions of cyanoacrylate. The invention depends on the posi tioning of high density polyethylene 112 in direct contact with the cyanoacrylate type product, and positioning a primer 114 on the other side of the high density polyethylene. Preferred embodiments of the sheet structure include addition al layers e.g. 116 to provide barrier and abuse resistance pro perties, and the necessary adhesive materials to hold the vari ous layers of the structure together with good adhesion. Addi tional layers are contemplated. The sheet structure can be formed into a package which positions the high density poly ethylene adjacent the cyanoacrylate product, and between it and the other layers at all locations of contact between the cyanoacrylate product and the packaging sheet material.
