# Apparatus for scaling fascimile image data.

## Abstract
An apparatus for converting first image data, comprising a matrix of rows and columns of image pels each comprising grey scale data of a corresponding point on an original image, to a matrix of second image data of different resolution, comprises means 34 to 37 for forming a first scale factor corresponding to the ratio of the resolution of the first image to that of the second image in the row direction, and means 44 to 47 for forming a second scale factor corresponding to the ratio of the resolution of the first image to that of the second image in the column direction. The row coordinate of each successive column of second image pels is multiplied 38, 39 by the first scale factor to give, in each case, a whole number TAB and a fractional remainder ΔX, and each successive pair of values TAB and ΔX is stored 40 . The column coordinate of each successive row of second image pels is multiplied 48, 49 by the second scale factor to give, in each case, a whole number NEXT PAIR and a fractional remainder ΔY, and each successive pair of values NEXT PAIR and ΔY is also stored 50 .
