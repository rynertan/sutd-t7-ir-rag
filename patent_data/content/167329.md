# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO ARTIFICIAL FINGERNAILS

## Abstract
An artificial fingernail for adhering to the exposed surface of a natural fingernail made of an acrylontrile butadiene styrene polymer and having a rear portion 9 of reduced thickness to enable the portion 9 to be pressed down onto the natural nail to achieve a close fitting junction with the cuticle of the natural nail. The border between the area 9 of reduced thickness and the remainder of the artificial nail is convex with respect to the rear edge 5 of the nail, when viewed in plan. The rear edge 5 of the nail, when viewed from the rear of the nail, presents an inverted, deeply convex configuration. The artificial nail is adhered to the natural nail using a liquid cyanoacrylate adhesive.
