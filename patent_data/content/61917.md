# COLLAGEN FIBERS FOR USE IN MEDICAL TREATMENT

## Abstract
Problems with the quality of collagen fibers prepared by conventional means for use in medicine are overcome by collagen fibers having 312 to 340 glycine residues, 119 to 138 proline residues, 94 to 100 hydeoxyproline residues and 2.6 to 5.5 tyrosine residues per 1000 amino acid residues, denaturation temperature of 31 to 40 C, and a S constant of 1.12 to 1.62. Such fibers, which can be used as a blood coagulant, are prepared by dispersing a purified collagen, which shows no absorption in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum of wavelength 250 290 nm and which contains less than 0.5 by weight of lipids, in an aqueous acid solution of pH 2 to 4 and irradiating this dispersion at a temperature of not more than 30 C with ultrasonic waves to provide more than 452 kJ of energy per litre of dispersion.
