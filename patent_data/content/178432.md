# Pseudorandom number generator.

## Abstract
The pseudorandom number generator consists of a M sequence generator 1 whose output is fed in parallel to a hardware shuffling device 4 . The M sequence generator represents a polynomial circuit including a shift register 2 the shuffling device is a matrix multiplication circuit 4 with a characteristic matrix G which generates the random numbers with the desired statistical properties.
