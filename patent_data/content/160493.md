# PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF CHACOGENS AND CHALCOGENIDE ALLOYS OF CONTROLLED AVERAGE CRYSTALLITE SIZE

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of chalcogens and chal cogenide alloys which comprises subjecting the correspond ing esters to a reduction or coreduction reaction, for example using hydrazine, at a temperature between about 40 C and 135 C. The morphology crystallite size of the product is controlled by suitably selecting a temperature within this range, depending on the particular chalcogen or alloy being prepared. The product is either a non crystalline material, or has an average crystallite size between about 15 and 52 nm.
