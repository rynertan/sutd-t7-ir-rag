## Description
Method and device for laying piping and piping laid by said method. The invention relates in the first place to a method of laying a piping comprising a series of prefaSri cated, concrete piping elements aligned to one another with the aid of joint bridging means. A difficulty resides in positioning each piping element to be laid. This operation requires much time and there is a risk of damaging the sealing strip. Therefore, piping laid by using a known method is sometimes not watertight. The invention has for its object to avoid said drawbacks.For this purpose each time a piping element to be laid is deposited in joint relation with a piping element already positioned, wherein the former element is provided with locating means extending in the axial direction of this piping element further than the joint bridging means, said piping element being deposited with the aid of the locating means at an axial distance from the previously positioned piping element substantially in line to the previously positioned piping element, after which the piping element maintained in line with the aid of the locating means is driven into the position in which it joins the previously positioned piping element. When the locating means are each time releasably fastened to a piping element and are repeatedly used, the method according to the invention requires only a low investment device. The invention furthermore relates to a device for carrying out the method according to the invention which is characterized by locating means to be releasably fastened to a piping element to be laid in a manner such that they extend in an axial direction beyond the joint bridging means. The piping element to be laid is preferably driven into its correct position by drawing it thereto with the aid of drawing means, whilst at the end remote from the previously positioned piping element it is grasped by a hook and the locating means of the previously positioned piping element are used as anchoring means for the drawing means. In this method the location previously aligned is fully safeguarded against disturbance during the displacement. A releasable and yet firm connection between the locating means and the piping element is established when the locating means are each time releasably fastened to an anchor embedded in the concrete of a piping element. A shift in longitudinal and transverse direction and relative angular turn about the longitudinal axis can be avoided in a simple manner when with the aid of the locating means the two lower corners of a piping element are grasped. The manipulations for displacing and locating the piping elements can partly be performed in an uninterrupted operation when each time a piping element is suspended to a lifting device through hangers engaging locating means fastened to the piping element. The aforesaid anchors on a piping element can be avoided by fastening the locating means through a fastening member extending in the joint between two piping elements to at least one pin extending in an axial direction in said two piping elements and bridging the joint and or by fastening the locating means to a piping element through a hook extending in the joint between two piping elements as far as into a recess preferably accommodating a sealing strip. The piping laid by carrying out the method according the invention can be characterized by locating means arranged on the piping elements and extending in an axial direction beyond the joint bridging means. A safe seal between the piping elements is obtained by joint bridging means comprising an elastic sealing strip and at least two pins bridging the joint and extending into two opposite recesses bounding the joint, said pins limiting the relative transverse movements of the joining piping elements, bt allowing relative angular position variations. The joint bridging means preferably comprise a sealing strip having sealing tags of sawtooth profile. A sealing strip provided with a reinforcing tape may itself r fulfil the sealing function as well as the function of maintaining the alignment of the joined piping elements. Even in a piping characterized by rims of the joining zipping elements gripping one around the other at each joint with the interposition of an elastic sealing strip and by at least two pins bridging the joint and extending into opposite joint bounding recesses, said pins limiting the relative transverse movements of the joining piping elements, but allowing relative angular position variations, the pins ensure that the piping elements remain substantially aligned to one another and that, therefore, the sealing strip can satisfactorily continue fulfilling its function in a gap which will neither become too wide nor too narrow. The invention will be described mDre fully herein after with reference to a drawing. The drawing shows schematically in Figure 1 a perspective illustratisn of the method in accorcance with the invention, Figure 2 detail II in a later stale of the method of Figure 1, Figures, 3, 4, 5 and 6 each a side elevation of a piping in successive stages of deposition b carrying out the method o Figure 1, Figure 7 a side elevation like Figure 6 of a deposited piping fraction in sloping position, Figures 8 and 9 each a plan view of a deposited piping fraction in a bend, Figure 10 an enlarged front view of detail X ofFigure 2, Figure 11 a sectional view taken on the line XI XI of Figure 10, Figure 12 an enlarged rear view of detail XII ofFigure 2, Figure 13 a sectional view taken on the lineXIII XIII of Figure 12, Figures 14 and 18 different variants of Figure 10, Figure 15 a sectional view taken on the line XV XV in Figure 14, Figures 16 and 20 a variant of Figure 12, Figure 17 a variant of Figure 13, Figure 19 a sectional view taken on the lineXIX XIX in Figure 18, Figure 21 a sectional view taken on the lineXXI XI in Figure 20, Figure 22 a cross sectional view taken on the joint during the positioning of a piping element, Figure 23 a variant of detail XXIII of Figure 22, Figure 24 a vertical longitudinal sectional view of a fraction of a piping laid in accordance with the invention, Figure 25 on an enlarged scale detail XXV of Figure 24, and Figures 26, 27 and 28 enlarged, perspective views of details XXVI, XXVII and XXVIII respectively of Figure 24. In the method according to the invention a piping 50 is deposited on the flat bottom 2 of a ditch 1 with the interposition of setting means 4. Instead of the bottom 2 of a ditch 1 a different foundation may be used. In the examples shown the piping 50 has a hollow, U shaped profile, on which afterwards a cover can be placed in order to allow access to, replacement or repair of electric cables, telephone cables or water pipes and or tubes, for example, of a municipal heating system, which have been accommodated in the piping 50. The piping 50 has to be watertight. The piping 50 consists of a series of prefabricated, concrete piping elements 3 aligned to one another with the aid of joint bridging means 10 at each joint 9. The piping elements 3 to be laid, previously put ready for depo sition along the ditch 1 are each time picked up with the aid of a lifting device 6 and a suspension device 7 and positioned at a place 51 at a given distance from the previously positioned piping element 3 in the suspension device. Subsequently the deposited piping element 52 is drawn with the aid of drawing means 8 consisting of draw cables 12, cylinders 13 and draw rings 19 towards the former piping element 3 to an extent such that the elastic sealing strip 46 arranged in the joint 9 ensures a watertight closure.After the deposition of municipal heating tubes, cables and the like the piping 50 ofU shaped profile is covered in a watertight manner with a cover not shown , after which the ditch 1 may be filled up with earth or the cover may serve as a sidewalk or a road pavement. As shown in Figures 3 to 6, the piping elements 3 to be laid have fastened to them locating means 11, whic extend in the axial direction of the piping element 3 beyond the joint bridging means 10. These locating means 11 are repeatedly used and are, therefore, releasably fastened to the piping element 3. The locating means 11 see Figure 10 comprise two locating elements 11 fitting in the rounded off inner corners 37 of the piping element 3 and having to this end a similarly rounded off plate 38, to which is welded a vertically extending ridge 57 extending into the joint 9. An appreciable portion 11 of the piping element 3 protrudes from the plate 38 to the outside and constitutes a stop in a vertical and a transverse direction for the corresponding inner corner 37 of the deposited piping element 3.In this way the bottom surfaces 58 as well as the downwards slightly diverging sidewalls 59 of the interengaging piping elements 3 are aligned, whilst the piping element 3 of Figures 3 and 4 is held at a given distance from the piping element 3 already positioned. The level of the end 60 of the piping element 3 remote from the joint 9 is maintained with the aid of setting means 4 consisting see Figure 123 of a wedge 61 bearing on a beam 63 The plate 38 is releasably fastened to an eye shaped anchor 35 embedded in the concrete of the piping element 3 and extending through a recess 66 of the plate 38 and being firmly fixed thereto by means of a wedge 36 Figures 10 and 11 . To the plate 38 employed as an anchoring means 56 is furtherrore welded a hoisting eyelet 34, which can be engaged each time by one of four cables 14 of a four cable suspension device 7. The cables 14 include length setting members 15 for arranging the piping elements 3 in the position desired for the deposition. Moreover, a draw eye 19 is welded to the plate 38. At each inner corner 37 see Figures 12 and 13 a drawhook 67 is fastened by means of a wedge 36 to an eye shaped anchor 35 embedded in the concrete of the piping element 3, a vertical strip 68 of said anchor, which grasps behind the end 60, being welded to the bent plate 38. Fur thermore, a hoisting eyelet 34 for a cable 14 and a draw eyelet 19 are welded to the plate 38. Between each draw eyelet 19 of the anchor means 56 of the piping element 3 already positioned and each draw eyelet 19 of the drawhook 67 of the piping element 3 to be deposited is arranged a draw cable 12 with a hydraulic stretcher 13 in order to drive the aligned piping element 3 into the sealing position in contact with the positioned piping element 3, during which operation the locating means 11 arranged on the piping element 3 to be deposited maintain these piping elements 3 in alignment. During this manipulation the joint bridging means 10 are moved into their sealing state. These joint bridging means 10 comprise an elastic sealing strip 46 of T shaped profile as well as two pins 31, also termed dowel pins. The transverse strip 17 of the T shapeg profile prevents a direct contact between the concrete of the consecutive elements 3 so that slight settlings cannot cause damage. Each pin 31 is accommodated in corresponding, slightly larger bores 30 of the joining piping elements 3 and extends in the axial direction of the piping 50, whilst bridging the joint 9.These pins 31 have a bevelled end 70. The sealing strip 46 has two substantially wedge shaped tags 53 fitting in correspondingly shaped grooves 71 of the piping elements 3. These grooves 71 converge inwardly and have a rounded off part 72 at the entrance in order to enhance a damage free penetration of the tags 53. Each tag 53 has a wedge shaped tip 54 seeFigure 22 . The sawtooth profile of the tags 53 is such that the slope 69 facing the tip 54 is the slightly inclined flank of each sawtooth 73. The pins 31 axially extend outwardly beyond the tag 53 away from the same piping element 3 so that along viewing lines 47 and 48 of the shortest possible length of pins 31 along the tag 53 it can be assessed wether the pins are correctly in line with the bores 30.Each bore 30 has a diameter D of, for example, 44 mms for a diameter d of a pin 31 of, for example, 40 mms, so that a clearance q is obtained which does allow relative angle variaticns and a small relative, transverse shift of the joining piping elements 3, but which prevents disturbance of the sealing effect of the sealing strip 46, that is to say, a large transverse shift.In order to avoid the use of the anchor 35 of Figures 10 to 13 embedded in the concrete, each plate 38 of the anchoring means 56 is fastened, as shown in Figures 14 to 17, to a pin 31 by means of a flexible member, for example, a chain 39 gripping around said pin and extending in the joint 9, said member gripping on the one hand around a hook 74 welded to the plate 38 and being fastened on the other hand to the plate 33 by way of a chain stretcher 75. wn order to maintain a small joint width t in the case of a broader chain 39, the latter is housed in an encasing 76. The crawhook 67 is correspondingly fastened to a pin 31. It is aso feasible to provide a hole in the strip 68 of Figure 13 fcr passing the pin 31 see Figure 17 . It should be noted tflt as shown in Figures 14 to 17 the pins 31 are arranged on the inner side of the sealing strip 46. If the chain width z is smaller than the width t of the joint 9, the encasing 76 is redun dant. When a piping element 3 is lifted by the pins 31 and the anchoring means 56 and 67, the latter are fastened to one another in an axial direction by means of the draw mechanism 5 comprising the draw cable 16 with the stretcher 20 and the draw eyelets 19. Inteac of using releasable locating means and hoisting eyelets to be directly arranged on the anchors 35, a hoisting yoke 22 may be employed, on which the locating means are arranged. Figures 7, 8 and 9 show pipings 50 having fitting pieces 21, 23 and 24 respectively, which are disposed between straight piping elements 3. At the bend of Figure 9 is shown a reaction founcation 27. The embodiment of Figures 18 to 22 is distinguished from that of Figures 10 to 13 in that the plates 8 of the anchoring means 67 and 56 each extend by a transverse rim 42 resisting to bending and a bent over strip 43 as far as into the sealing slot 29. Thus during the transport of a piping element 3 by means of the stretching cable 16, the draw eyelets 19 and the hydraulic rams 20, the anchoring means 67 and 56 are immovabl held in place. A further development of the sealing strip shown in Figure 23 is capable of withstanding transverse forces so that the pins 3 may be dispensed with. For this Elrpose a reinforcing tape 41 is embedded in the sealing strip 77. The tape 41 may be ade of steel, synthetic resin, glass fibre, reinforced synthetic resin and the like in accordance with the requirement of strength. The p ping 50 of Figure 24 comprises piping elements 3 of U shaped profile and cover elements 78, 79 and 80, the elements 79 and 80 having transverse rims of shapes differing to an extent such that the cover element 80 may be removed to leave a manhole. The sealing strip 81 ns arranged between rims 82 of joining piping elements 3 and cover elements 78, 79, 80 respectively. Pins 83 correspending with the pins 31 but extending axially less far as the rims 82 ensure that the sealing effect of the elastic sealing strips 81 will not be disturbed. The rims 82 are in this case used as locating means fastened to the piping elements, since they co operate as locating stops during the mounting operation.
