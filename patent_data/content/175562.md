## Description
This invention relates to acrylate, hot melt, pressure sensitive adhesives more particularly to N vinyl caprolactam containing acrylate, hot melt, pressure sensitive adhesives. More specifically, the invention relates to such adhesives which adhere well to human skin and are useful for medical products and which adhesives are polymerized compositions containing 2 ethylhexyl acrylate 2 EHA , isobutyl methacrylate IBMA , N vinyl caprolactam NVCL and optionally, but preferably, n butyl acrylate BA as well, many of which adhesives adhere well to skin even under moist conditions. The hot melt adhesive possesses the reversible properties of strong cohesive strength at ambient temperature and desirable melt viscosity at elevated coating temperatures. The present invention provides a process for making the hot melt adhesive as well as a process for making ostomy seals, adhesive tapes and bandages, wound drainage adhesive seals, wound dressings and the like that adhere to human skin and remain adherent even in a moist environment. Although many adhesive compositions are known, very few of these are completely satisfactory for application to human skin. The requirements for such adhesives are stringent they must adhere well to human skin during perspiration, when the weather is hot, or in an environment of draining wounds, yet be removable without leaving adhesive residue on the skin s surface. Numerous homopolymers, copolymers and terpolymers have been proposed for use as polymeric adhesives. The demands of modern technology, however, are for even higher requirements of adhesion and cohesion. Adhesion should take effect immediately on application to skin, even in a hot or moist environment, and should release cleanly when voluntarily removed in this environment. Many acrylate homopolymers, copolymers and terpolymers previously used as medical adhesives lose adhesion in a moist environment. In the prior art, acrylic esters have been copolymerized with small portions of monomers such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, acrylamide, methacrylamide, acrylic esters, vinyl esters, n alkoxyalkyl unsaturated carboxylic acid amides, half esters, half amides, amide esters, amides and imides of maleic anhydride, and the alkylaminoalkylene monoesters of maleic, itaconic or citraconic acids. Although the use of these compositions results in adhesives which adhere well to dry skin, many of these compositions lose adhesiveness in a hot or moist environment. U.S. Patent No. 4,379,881 discloses an acrylic adhesive containing acrylic acid that adheres to skin under dry and moist conditions. Not withstanding the utility and commercial success of acrylic pressure sensitive adhesives, there are numerous applications of medical adhesives requiring such outstanding adhesive performance, in a moist environment, that presently available pressure sensitive adhesives have not been entirely satisfactory. Thus, there is a need for pressure sensitive adhesives having improved adhesion to skin for ostomy adhesive seals, wound drainage adhesive seals, surgical tapes, dressings, drapes, adhesive bandages, and the like. In the past, attempts have been made to produce acrylic based hot melt adhesives by incorporating 0.5 to 25 by weight of metallic chelating agents, such as zinc or cadmium salts to an amine containing copolymer. The produced adhesives possess non permanent, reversible bonds and showed an increase in Williams Plasticity Number from 0.93 to 1.25 mm U.S. Patent No. 3,925,282 . Another method found in the patent literature for improving cohesive strength of acrylic based, hot melt adhesives is blending two copolymers, one copolymer containing a tertiary amine group, and the other has a built in organic acid group. Upon mixing, a reversible ionic bonding is formed. U.S. Patent No. 4,405,517 . U.S. Patent No. 4,337,325 Shah , The Kendall Company, discloses hot melt, pressure sensitive compositions comprising a blend of copolymers consisting of acrylic monomers and vinyl lactam, and can use N vinyl caprolactam. The copolymer adhesive blend exhibits a viscosity less than 100 Pas at 350 F 177 C . Applicant does not use blends, but rather uses only a single polymer component consisting of 3 or 4 monomers to make the adhesive of the present invention. U.S. Patent No. 4,379,881 R.F. Peck , Smith and Nephew Company, discloses an adhesive polyacrylate containing n butyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate and acrylic acid that may be used for dressings and adheres firmly to skin under dry and moist conditions. U.S. Patent No. 4,164,614 Ames , Eastman Kodak, discloses hot melt adhesive compositions containing 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, N vinyl 2 pyrrolidone and styrene. In addition, additional hot melt, pressure sensitive adhesive compositions are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,423,182. The prior art hot melt adhesives all differ significantly from those of the present invention in various respects particularly in lacking N vinyl caprolactam NVCL which is a key component of the polymerized composition of the present invention. An improved hot melt, pressure sensitive adhesive requires higher Williams Plasticity Numbers to avoid cold flow, above 1.5 mm. An adhesive for medical usage generally has higher requirements, such as no skin irritation, clarity, colorlessness, and higher moduli for lower adhesive transfer to skin. Hot melt adhesives made from amine containing monomers have a high tendency of discoloring and metallic chelating agents may cause skin irritation. Currently available hot melt pressure sensitive adhesives exhibit acceptable tack, however, the cold flow, creep resistance and low modulus properties need improvement. The novel hot melt, pressure sensitive adhesives of the present invention utilize acrylic monomers which contain neither organic amine, nor acid functional groups, nor metallic salts. The hot melt adhesives of the present invention are polymerized compositions containing 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, isobutyl methacrylate, and N vinyl caprolactam and may also contain, as an optional ingredient for the preferred adhesive, n butyl acrylate. It should be understood that while their medical uses will be emphasized herein, the adhesives of the present invention can also be used for various non medical adhesive applications which may have much less stringent requirements in regard to various properties, and the less preferred adhesives of the present invention could be so used. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide an improved medical pressure sensitive adhesive. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a hot melt, pressure sensitive adhesive having improved wear performance, particularly having good adhesion to skin under hot or moist conditions where skin perspiration or draining wound affects adhesion. The present invention further provides an economical process for making the adhesive composition and a method for coating the adhesive onto a substrate. A novel medical, acrylic, hot melt, pressure sensitive adhesive is disclosed that possesses high adhesive strength to human skin and high cohesive strength that remains adhered to skin, and on voluntary removal negligible adhesive transfer to skin occurs. The adhesive is a polymerized composition containing The adhesive of the present invention has a Williams Plasticity Number sufficiently high to be useful, generally above 1.5 millimeters mm , and a melt viscosity permitting its application with modern equipment, e.g., from 40 to 350 Pas at 350 F 177 C . The adhesive compositions, of the present invention can be prepared by a process of solution polymerization. Catalysts generally used in solution polymerizations such as azo compounds, peroxy ester or peroxides are suitable for polymerization. The preferred catalyst is azobisisobutyronitrile. The amount of catalyst used is preferably between 0.05 percent to 1 percent based on the total monomer weight. The polymerization may contain a mercaptan compound to regulate or control the polymer molecular weight and adhesive melt viscosity. Tert dodecyl mercaptan, n dodecyl mercaptan, and trimethylol propane trimercaptopropionate are suitable for the polymerization. The amount of mercaptan used is preferably between zero to 0.5 percent. For medical, pressure sensitive adhesive sheet products, the hot melt adhesive is coated onto an appropriate backing substrate which may be a porous or nonporous material. Representative porous materials include polyurethane films, paper, and woven and nonwoven fabrics which may be composed of wood pulp, rayon, polyester, acetate fibers, cotton fibers, and blend combinations such as wood pulp and rayon, and wood pulp and polyester. Nonporous backings can be films of polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polypropylene and the like. The preferred novel hot melt adhesive compositions can produce medical adhesive sheet products which are substantially free from the disadvantages of most medical adhesive products known in the art. The adhesive polymer according to the present invention is distinguished in particular by the following advantages medical adhesive products prepared with the hot melt adhesive exhibit firm adhesion to moist skin such medical adhesive products exhibit excellent long term adhesion to skin the hot melt adhesive exhibits excellent resistance to degradation by water, sweat, urine, high pH and low pH and the hot melt adhesive has optimum melt viscosity for coating on substrates and excellent resistance to cold flow resulting in only trace amount of adhesive transfer to skin. For medical applications adhesives are often sterilized. The adhesives of the present invention may be sterilized, e.g., using cobalt 60 irradiation and very likely by the use of ethylene oxide which does not significantly effect their properties and characteristics, but need not be sterilized where sterilization is not needed for the use desired. The hot melt adhesive of the present invention is evaluated by coating the adhesive on a backing material on a reverse roll or slot die hot melt coating machine, or the adhesive may be coated on release paper for transfer to the backing. Prototypes of medical products which ideally are required to adhere to human skin and remain adherent even in a moist environment, such as ostomy adhesive seals, wound drainage adhesive seals, ulcer dressings, adhesive tapes, and adhesive bandages are made and wear performance tested on human subjects or animals. The medical product prototypes made with the hot melt adhesive of the present invention are compared in wear performance with commercial adhesive medical products. The invention will be described in greater detail by the following examples, in which all parts are by weight. As a quantitative aid to evaluating products of the present invention, it has been found helpful to employ certain empirical tests, which tests will now be described in more detail. Actual test results obtained are found in Tables I V, and are reported as the average for all test subjects. Any adhesive composition of the present invention having good wet stick performance will always have good dry stick performance as well. Some three component compositions, i.e., without the optional n butyl acrylate BA component, seem to exhibit good wet stick performance while others exhibit only dry stick adhesive performance. The wet stick adhesion performance is somewhat dependent on the level of NVCL in the composition. With less than about 15 NVCL, wet stick adhesion to wet skin is poor, while with above about 25 NVCL, the composition is too stiff or too hard and lacks adhesive character. The examples set forth below will serve to illustrate the invention in certain of its embodiments without acting as a limitation upon its scope. Examples 1 4 and 7 10 illustrate various four component adhesives, all within the scope of the present invention, containing 2 EHA, BA, IBMA and NVCL. Example 5 illustrates a two component adhesive containing 2 EHA and NVCL which is outside the scope of the present invention. Example 6 illustrates a three component adhesive without any BA, which is a less preferred form of the present invention being effective on dry skin but not on moist skin. Examples 1 7 and 9 10 illustrate various representative batch polymerizations while Example 8 illustrates a different type of process involving a slow feed over a period of several hours. Differing conditions and ingredients are shown to result in adhesives with different physical characteristics. The various Examples also serve to illustrate how persons skilled in the art can make various well known medical devices utilizing the adhesives of the present invention.
