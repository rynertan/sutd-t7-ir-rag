# NEUTRON GENERATOR ION SOURCE PULSER

## Abstract
Apparatus for producing a pulsed high voltage source for use with a pulsed neutron generator in a logging tool in a borehold, the apparatus comprising a means for receiving a high voltage supply 16 48 b field effect transistor means comprising at least a pair of field effect transistors 51 to 53 and 54 to 58 serially con nected between said high voltage receiving means and ground c an output terminal between the two transistors of said at least one pair or field effect transistor means, said output terminal being adapted to be connected by a conductor 50 to provide pulsed high voltage to a neutron generator 20 and d control pulse forming means 70 connected to the gates of the or each respective two transistors, said pulse forming means forming control pulses selectively switching said transistors off and on in timed sequence to thereby con nect the output terminal to said high voltage receiving means.
