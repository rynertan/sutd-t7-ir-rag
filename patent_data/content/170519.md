# A method of producing a sealed metal oxide hydrogen storage cell.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method of producing a sealed metal oxide hydrogen storage cell, comprising the step of housing in a container 1 a cathode 4 containing a metal oxide as an active material, an anode 2 containing a hydrogen storage alloy as the main component, a separator 3 for separating the cathode 4 and the anode 2 , a pre charging member 6 , and an electrolyte solution consisting of an alkaline aqueous solution. The pre charging member is electrically combined with the anode 2 and consists of a metal having a less noble potential than the hydrogen electrode potential within the alkaline solution. A material containing said metal as the main component may also be used as the precharging member 6 . The storage cell has a desired anode cathode capacity balance and exhibits a long life.
