# Integrated semiconductor device and process for producing it.

## Abstract
In a semiconductor device, a polycrystalline semiconductor layer e.g. silicon is used for a resistor element of the device instead of a conventional, diffused resistor or a channel resistor, in which the channel resistance of an MOS transistor is utilised as the resistor. The length of the polycrystalline silicon layer 21c used for the resistor element R1 is predetermined by the other polycrystalline silicon layer 24 , formed above the resistor element. The structure of the semiconductor device according to the present invention is suited for a high density integrated circuit.
