# A method for producing fine spinel powders.

## Abstract
A fine spinell powder of high purity and suitable as a raw material for producing a dense and uniform spinel sintered body are produced by hydrolyzing an alcohol solution con taining magnesium alkoxide and aluminium alkoxide in the molar ratio 1 2 3, each of the alkoxides and the alcohol hav ing 1 to 3 carbon atoms. The precipitated hydroxides are dried and heated to give the fine spinel powder.
