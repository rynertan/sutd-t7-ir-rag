## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION 8 SUBSTITUTED 9 HYDROXYALKYL AND HYDROXYALKOXYMETHYLGUANINES AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAININGTHEM. The present invention is directed to novel 8 substituted 9 hydroxyalkyl and hydroxyalkoxymethylguanines and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. These compounds are superior inhibitors of purine nucleoside phosphorylase PNP and possess utility in the treatment of cancer, especially of leukemia, as well as in the treatment of virus infections, such as herpes viruses.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It has been suggested by Stoeckler et al.,Biochemical Pharmacology, 31, No. 2, pp. 163 171, 1982, among others, that inhibition of the erythrocytic purine nucleoside phosphorylase PNP catalytic activity in mammals might give rise to immunosuppresive activity and might have significant chemotherapeutic utility for the treatment of tumors and hyperuricemic states. It is suggested that in the absence of the salvage enzyme, PNP, either due to a natural deficiency or to potent inhibition, 2 deoxyguanosine administered to a patient is converted to corresponding nucleotides and that accumulated dGTP reduces deoxynucleotide pools through feedback inhibition of ribonucleotide diphosphate reductase which may be toxic to cells undergoing DNA synthesis.Coadministration of a potent PNP inhibitor may also permit certain potentially effective chemotherapeutic purine nucleoside analogs, which compounds or their metabolic products are substrates for PNP, to survive bloodstream transport and reach their tumor targets before being converted in the vascular system to the respective free bases which may be less effective than the nucleosides. Finally, by facilitating the excretion of nucleic acid degradation products other than uric acid, PNP inhibitors may have therapeutic utility in hyperuricemic states such as gout and the neurologic disorder, Lesch Nyhan syndrome. Known inhibitors of PNP, such as 8aminoguanine, 8 aminoguanosine, Sc deoxy 5 iodoinosine or 5 chloro 5 deoxyformycin B, are either substrates for PNP as well as being inhibitors of the enzyme, or have only moderate affinity for the enzyme In order for substances to be useful as PNP inhibitors, these materials must be poor enzyme substrates while still demonstrating high binding affinity for the enzyme, which would simulate the situation found in the PNP immunodeficient state. It was therefore an object of this invention to provide novel compounds having potency as purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitors. It was another object of this invention to provide a chemotherapeutic method of treatment for cancers.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This present invention relates to novel 8 substituted 9 hydroxyalkyl and hydroxyalkoxymethylguanines of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R1 is mono or polyhydroxy C1 C6 straight or branched chain alkyl, containing 1 to 5 hydroxyl groups, such as 2 hydroxyethyl, 3 hydroxypropyl, 4 hydroxybutyl, 5 hydroxy pentyl, 6 hydroxyhexyl, 2,3 dihydroxypropyl, 2,4 dihydroxybutyl, 3,4 dihydroxybutyl, 2,3,4 trihydroxybutyl, 4 hydroxy 3 hydroxymethyl l butyl or 3 hydroxy 2 hydroxymethyl l propyl, or mono or polyhydroxy C1 C6 straight or branched chain alkoxymethyl, containing 1 to 5 hydroxy groups, such as 1,3 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl, 2,3 dihydroxy l propoxymethyl, 2,4 dihydroxy l butoxymethyl, 3 hydroxy 2 hydroxymethyl l propoxy methyl or 1,3, 4 trihydroxy 2 butoxymethyl, but not including CH2OCH2CH2OH and 3 3 34R is Cl, Br, F, I, NH2, OH, SH, R3, SR , NHR , NR R or OR3, where R3 and R4 are independently C1 C20 straight or branched chain, saturated or unsaturated where the degree of unsatura tion is limited to a maximum of 3 double bonds alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, hexyl, octyl, 2 octyl, dodecyl, hexadecyl, allyl or 2 buten 1 yl , which may or may not contain a C3 C10 mono or bicyclic group, including aromatics or heteroaromatics as in the case of benzyl, phenylethyl, furfurylt 2 pyridylmethyl, 2 2 pyridyl ethyl, 2 3 pyridyl ethyl, 2 pyrimidnylmethyl, 2 3 thienyl ethyl, 2 2 thiazolyl ethyl, 2 2 imidazolyl ethyl, cyclohexylmethyl or 2 cyclopropylethyl or C3 C10 mono or bicyclic, saturated or unsaturated alkyl, aromatic or heteroaromatic, where the degree of unsaturation is limited to a maximum of 5 double bonds such as cyclo hexyl, cyclopropyl, phenyl, 2 naphthyl, 2 pyr idyl, 3 pyr idyl, 2 pyrimidinyl, 2 pyrazinyl, 3 pyrazolyl, 5 tetrazolyl, l indanyl, 2 decalinyl, 2 imidazolyl, 3 isoxazolyl, 2 oxazolyl, 8 quinolinyl, 2 benzimidazolyl, 2 thienyl, 3 thienyl, 2 thiazolyl, 4 thiazolyl, 2 benzthiazolyl, l,3,5 triazin 2 yl, 1,2,4 triazol 3 yl or l,3,4 thiadiazol 2 yl or where, in NR3R4, R and R together are a C3 C10 alkylene group such that NR3R4 is, for example, piperidino or pyrrolidino and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds of the instant invention include the racemic mixture of the stereo configurations as well as both the R and S enantiomers. Examples of the compounds according to the present invention include 8 amino 9 1,3 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine 8 amino 9 2,3 dihydroxy l propoxymethyl guanine 8 amino 9 4 hydroxybutyl guanine 8 amino 9 3,4 dihydroxybutyl guanine 8 amino 9 4 hydroxy 3 hydroxymethyl 1 butyl guanine 8 hydroxy 9 1,3 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine 8 methyl 9 4 hydroxybutyl guanine 8 mercapto 9 1, 3 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine 8 methylamino 9 l,3 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine 8 amino 9 1,4 dihydroxy 2 butoxymethyl guanine 8 amino 9 3 hydroxy 2 hydroxymethyl 1 propoxy methyl guanine 8 bromo 9 1,3 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine 8 benzyloxy 9 1,3 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine and 8 hydroxy 9 4 hydroxybutyl guanine. Preferred compounds according to the instant invention are those wherein R1 contains at least one primary hydroxyl group, such as CH2OCH CH2OH 2 or CH2OCH2CHOHCH2OH and R2 is NH2. Such compounds include 8 amino 9 l,3 dihydroxy 2 propoxy methyl guanine, 8 amino 9 2,3 dihydroxy I propoxy methyl guanine and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. These novel acyclonucleoside compounds, in addition to having antiviral activity, demonstrate very good PNP binding affinities and low reaction rates. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the instant invention include the conventional soluble, non toxic salts of the compounds of this invention formed, for example, from non toxic inorganic or organic acids. Such conventional non toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric or nitric, or from organic acids, such as ethane disulfonic, trifluoroacetic, isethionic, acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2 acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, and the like. The present invention also relates to the preparation of these 8 substituted 9 hydroxyalkyl or hydroxyalkoxymethyl guanines by three general synthetic methods Method A consists of direct halogenation of the 9 hydroxyalkyl or 9 hydroxyalkoxymethylguanine at the 8 position. This general method has been reviewed by J. H. Lister in FusedPyrimidines, Part II Urines, 1 ed by D. J. Brown Vol. 24 Part II in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds,11 A. Weissberger and E. C. Taylor, eds.l, Wiley Interscience, New York 1971 , pp. 146 147.The 8 bromo derivatives, for example, are particularly well prepared by this method. In Method B, a 9 hydroxyalkyl or 9 hydroxyalkoxymethylguanine substituted at the 8 position by a leaving group, for example, an 8 bromo derivative prepared by Method A, is reacted with a nucleophile to introduce a new substituent at the 8 position.Thus, the 8 bromo group can be replaced in this way by alkoxide, phenoxide, mercaptide, substituted amino, and other related groups, These general reactions have been reviewed by Lister ref. cited above, pp. 158 186 . Unsubstituted 8 amino 9 hydroxyalkyl or hydroxyalkoxymethyl guanines are readily prepared by reaction of the corresponding 8 bromoguanine from Method A with hydrazine, as the intermediate 8 hydrazino compound breaks down to give the 8 amino derivative Lister, ref. cited above, pp.169 170 R.E. Holmes and R. K. Robins, J. Am. Chem.Soc., 87, 1772 1965 . The 8 hydroxy 9 hydroxyalkylor hydroxyalkoxymethylguanines may also be obtained using Method B by initial displacement of a bromo group or other leaving group at the 8 position by benzyloxide, followed by a deprotection step in which the O benzyl group is removed by hydrogenolysis or other methods known in the literature R. E. Holmes and R. K. Robins, J. Am. Chem. Roc., 87, 1772 1965 . Method C consists of ring closure reaction of a 5 amino 6 hydroxyalkylamino isocytosine with an appropriate one carbon reagent to give an 8 substituted 9 hydroxyalkyl guanine. The 5 amino 6 hydroxyalkylamino isocytosine may be prepared from a 6 hydroxyalkylamino 5 nitroso or 5 nitroisocytosine see, for example, A. Yamazaki, Chem. Pharm. Bull., 17, 1268 1969 by reduction using any of several known methods, such as catalytic hydrogenation, zinc dust, or sodium dithionite. The resulting 5,6diaminoisocytos ine may be reacted with a variety of reagents to give 8 substituted guanines. For example, fusion with urea gives an 8 hydroxyguanine, and fusion with thiourea gives an 8 mercaptoguanine, which may then be alkylated on sulfur.Reaction of the diaminoisocytosine with an organic acid derivative under dehydrative conditions furnishes the 8 alkyl or 8 arylguanine. The 5 amino group may be acylated prior to ring closure. Thus, heating a 5 acetamido 6 hydroxyalkylamino isocytosine with acetic anhydride gives the 9 hydroxyalkyl 8 methylguanine. These and related ring closure reactions of 5,6 diaminopyrimidines with one carbon reagents to give 8 substituted purines have been well reviewed byLister op. cit., pp. 31 90 . A pharmaceutical composition may then be prepared comprising an effective amount of a compound according to the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor, such as aseptic saline solution, lactose or corn starch, with or without an adjuvant, such as alum.Useful pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may also contain other active ingredients, such as 6 mercaptopurine, 6 thioinosine or 6 thioguanosine, which are potentiated by the inclusion of a PNP inhibitor, in effective amounts which may be coadministered with the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof according to the present invention. These pharmaceutical compositions may be given orally or parenterally to mammalian, avian or piscine species, at dose levels of from about 0.1 to about 250 mg per kg, preferably from about 1.0 to 50 mg per kg, of animal body weight, and are used in humans in a unit dosage form which is administered as needed in an amount of about 1 to about 250 mg per dose. For oral administration, fine powders or granules of the compositions according to the invention may contain diluting, dispersing and or surface active agents, and may be presented in a draught, in water or in a syrup in capsules or sachets in the dry state, or in a non aqueous solution or suspension, wherein suspending agents may be included in tablets, wherein binders and lubricants may be included or in a suspension in water or a syrup. Where desirable or necessary, flavoring, preserving, suspending, thickening or emulsifying agents may be included. Tablets and granules are preferred, and these may be coated. For parenteral administration or for administration as drops, the compounds may be presented in aqueous solution in a concentration of from about 0.1 to 10 , more preferably 0.1 to 7 , most preferably 0.2 weight volume. The solution may contain antioxidants, buffers, and or other known additives. The invention is further defined by reference to the following examples, which are intended to be illustrative and not limiting.
