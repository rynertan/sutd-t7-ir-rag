## Description
Electrolytic capacitor . The invention relates to electrolytic capacitors having a predominantly non aqueous electrolyte having a high conductivity. GB PS 1,302,965 discloses such a capacitor which is used in particular there wherextremely high or extremely low temperatures may occur. Usually the capacitor comprises, positioned between the electrodes, a separator which is impregnated with the electrolyte. According to the above mentioned publication the electrolyte contains, as the dissolved material, a salt of nitrophenol the anion of which contributes to anodic oxidation of the metal surface. The anion may be chosen from the anions of picric acid, picramic acid, styphnic acid, dinitrophenol and nitrophenol, while a substituted or non substituted ammonium or an alkaline earth metal ion are mentioned.More specifically, ammonium , triethylammonium , triethanol ammonium , barium and calcium p nitrophenolate are mentioned. The high electrical conductivity of the electrolytes is mentioned as an important advantage. In practice it has appeared that the specified values cannot be obtained. When the recipes were reproduced, the values were found to be a factor of 3 to 10 lower. When highly capacitive anode material, for example highly capacitive etched and formed foil, which have recently become available are used, then an electrolyte having a high conductivity is an absolute requirement in order to keep the electric losses of the capacitor low when said foil is used, the reason being that the product of resistance and capacitance of a capacitor must at least remain constant. This product RC CX eKd is independent of the geometrical surface of the foil. In this equation R the resistance of the electrolyte impregnated separator. C the capacitance of the ca pacitor. the capacitance per unit of surface area. the resistivity of the electrolyte. K a constant, relating to the material of the separator. d the thickness of the se parator. When C increases the value of e must decrease, or Cur , the specific conductivity of the electrolyte must increase. The invention provides an electrolyte which has a higher specific conductivity 5mS cm than the measured specific conductivity of the examples included in the above mentioned GB Patent Specification. Whereas generally electrolytes have a lower breakdown voltage according as the conductivity is higher, the electrolytes in accordance with the invention have a sufficiently high breakdown voltage r100 Volts , to make them suitable for general use in the entire range up to 100 Volts. According to the invention, an electrolytic capacitor comprising an anode provided with a dielectric oxide layer by anodic oxidation, a cathode, a separator and an electrolyte consisting of a solution of a salt of a nitrophenol in at least one dipolar organic solvent, is characterized in that dissolved in the electrolyte is a salt of 4 nitrophenol which may be substituted with one or more halogen, methyl and or ethyl groups, in combination or not in combination with one or more additional nitro groups, and of a primary or secondary aliphatic or heterocyclic amine or mixtures thereof in a concentration whereby a specific conductivity of at least 5 mS cm is obtained. In accordance with a further embodiment of the invented capacitor, improved properties are obtained when the electrolyte contains a small quantity of water not more than 10 by weight . This measure achieves in the first place an increase of the breakdown voltage. In addition , the forming behaviour is improved and the leakage current is decreased. The temperature range in which the capacitor may be used is slightly limited thereby as the conductivity at low temperatures decreases to a more significant extent. The breakdown voltage can be still further increased if in accordance with a further embodiment in addition to a small quantity of phosphoric acid or a solvable phosphate in a quantity of not more than 1 by weight preferably 0.02 by weight, boric acid or a soluble borate in a quantity of not more than 3 by weight, preferably 0.5 by weight, or chromic acid or a soluble di chromate in a quantity up to 1 by weight is added to the electrolyte.With this additions the capacitor may generally be used in the whole range up to and including 100 Volts with all the said dissolved 2 nitrophenols. The dipolar solvent which preferably consists of an amide, as these materials yield the highest conductivities, may in addition thereto comprise further organic components, such as r butyrolactone, valerolactone, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, dimethyl sulphoxide, propylene carbonate, N methyl pyrrolidone. In some cases, conductivities above 5 mS cm can be reached, even without amides. By way of example there now follows the specifications of some operational electrolytes which may be used in an aluminium foil wound capacitor.

The anode foil is etched and thereafter formed at a voltage which is at least 20 above the operating voltage. The cathode foil is only etched, so that the cathode capacitance is much higher than the capacitance of the formed anode foil. The resultant wound body is impregnated with the electrolyte, thereafter inserted in a container and subjected again to a forming voltage. The diameter of the tested electrolytic capacitors is 15 mm and its length 30 mm.

The result of this life test is shown in the following two Tables I and II. The values shown are the average values of 10 capacitors. The Tables show the initial values of the capacity C at 100 Hz, the equivalent series resistance esr at 100 Hz, the impedance Z measured at 100 kHz and the leakage current LC after 1 min., measured at the operating voltage. After these measurements the electrolytic capacitors are stored for the stated periods at 1250C, the operating voltage being applied to them, and cooled thereafter to room temperature, whereafter the measurements are repeated. The changes in the above mentioned quantities are shown in percents.

In the following Tables III and IV capacitors using electrolyte 1 in accordance with the invention are compared with capacitors comprising a conventional electrolyte 2. Electrolyte 2 is a known, non aqueous solution of the following composition 1000 g N,N dimethylacetamide 165 g ethylene glycol 100 g picric acid 55 g ammonium pentaborate The conductivity at 250C is 4.2 mS cm. When 4 by weight of water is added to the electrolyte the conductivity decreases to 3.6 mS cm. These Tables show for both electrolytes, without water and with 4 by weight of water, the result of a shelf test at 105 C, no voltage being applied, for electrolytic capacitors having an operating voltage of 70V and 11V, respectively. The electrical quantities are measured at the start of the test and after 96 hours testing.

This improved stability appears particularly fro low voltage electrolytic capacitors. Table III shows in particular the advantageous influence on the leakage current, of the addition of water both prior to and after the test. In Tables V and VI the low temperature properties of the electrolytes 1 and 2 are compared with eachother, 4 by weight of water having been added to each of them.

The electrolytes 1 and 2 are not suitable for use at 550C as crystallization occurs. It is possible to compose, within the framework of the invention, electrolytes which are suitable for use to said temperature.Table VII comprises 5 examples of electrolytes which all have the following composition 1 mole diethylammonium 4 nitrophenolate 8 solvent 2 co solvent, more specifically as follows Table VIIEMI9.1 Electrolyte SEP Solvent SEP Co solvent tb SEP 3 SEP N,N dimethylacetamide SEP N methylacetamide tb SEP 4 SEP N,N dimethylacetamide SEP N,N dimethylTormamide tb SEP 5 SEP N,N dimethylformamide SEP N methylformamide tb SEP 6 SEP N,N dimethylformamide SEP N methylpyrolidone tb SEP 7 SEP N,N dimethylformamide SEP ethylene SEP glycol tb Electrolytic capacitors were produced with these electrolytes in accordance with the instruction described in the foregoing.The following Table VIII shows the ratio of the impedance Z, measured at 100 Hz, at 40 and 550C with respect to the impedance at 200C, 2 by weight of water as well as 4 by weight of water having been added.
