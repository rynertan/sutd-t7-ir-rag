# Quick connect disconnect electrofluidic junction assembly.

## Abstract
A quick connect disconnect electrofluidic junction assembly 10 for simultaneously transferring fluid and electrical energy from respective sources of supply. The assembly includes a female terminal 12 with an internal receptacle 22 one end of which is open and surrounded by a peripheral wall. An electrical contract 30 is posi tioned inside the housing and spaced apart from the open end. A fluid passage extends through the housing and communicates with the receptacle. A male terminal 14 includes a hollow connector body 42 which is adapted to be push fit into the receptacle through its open end, with an electrical contact 45 on its forward end adapted to mate with the electrical contact in the housing. A sealing element 52 is located around the periphery of the body for providing a fluid tight seal between the body and the interior wall of the housing when inserted therein. A fluid channel 55 extends through the body between its forward end and the peripheral sealing element, so that fluid may be received from the receptacle, and then pass on through the body along with electrical leads whereby both an elec trical and fluid connection can be made to the assembly.
