## Description
The present invention relates to a dry cleaning method in which in a dry cleaner of using organic solvents such as perchloroethylene, 1,1,1, trichloroethane, turpentine oil series and the like, the already used solvent is replaced with another solvent which is soluble therein and has a lower boiling point, for example, Furon R113 or R11, during washing or immediately before drying inorder to thereby shorten a drying period of time. According to the present invention, the most proper washing method can be chosen for the greater part of materials, processings and morphologies of clothes, and troubles of clothes due to washing can be reduced remarkably. Further, the above mentioned apparatus and method of the present invention can advantageously save occupation space, equipment cost, volume of facilities, maintenace cost and the like. In additin thereto, a drying time can be reduced by half. The invention relates further to a dry cleaning apparatus. While FR A 987 567 discloses the use of different solvents for better understanding of the present invention a conventional dry cleaning technique, known from the practice, using solvents other than turpentine will be described in reference to Fig. 6. First, clothes 2 are thrown into a treating tank 10 by opening a door 1, and after the door 1 has been shut, the operation of the dry cleaner is begun. Afterward, a cleaning treatment generally makes progress in the following order. 1 A solvent 4 is pumped up from a solvent tank 3 via a valve 5 by means of a pump 6 and is delivered in a predetermined amount to the treating tank 10 through a route consisting of a valve 7 and a filter 8 or a route consisting of a valve 9. 2 A treating drum 11 is slowly rotated, and the solvent 4 is then circulated through a circuit consisting of the treating tank 10, a button trap 12, a valve 13, the pump 6, the valve 7, the filter 8 or the valve 9 in order to wash the clothes 2. 3 The solvent 4 is discharged through a route consisting of the treating tank 10, the button trap 12, the valve 13, the pump 6, a valve 14 and a distiller 15. Afterward, the treating drum 11 is rotated at a high speed to centrifuge the solvent 4 present in the clothes 2, and the centrifuged solvent 4 is then discharged in like manner. 4 The preceding processes 1 and 2 are repeated. 5 The solvent 4 is discharged to the solvent tank 3 through the treating tank 10, the button trap 12, the valve 13 and the valve 5. Afterward, the treating drum 11 is rotated at a high speed to centrifuge the solvent 4 present in the clothes 2, and the centrifuged solvent 4 is discharged therefrom. 6 The treating drum 11 is slowly rotated again, and air is circulated in the direction of an arrow 20 between the treating tank 10 and a recovery air duct 19 consisting of a fan 16, an air cooler 17 and an air heater 18, whereby the clothes 2 are dried. A solvent gas vaporized from the clothes 2 is condensed in an air cooler 17, is then delivered to a water separator 22 via a recovery passage 21, and is afterward introduced into a clean tank 24 through a solvent pipe 23. 7 When drying has been over, dumpers 25, 26 are opened as depicted by dotted lines in the drawing, and fresh air is taken in through the dumper 25. Further, the uncondensed solvent gas which has not been recovered in the air cooler 17 is discharged through the dumper 26 in order to take away the odor of the solvent in the clothes 2. 8 The solvent 4 forwarded to the distiller 15 in the preceding process 3 is evaporated, and is then condensed in a condenser 27. The condensed solvent 4 is introduced into the clean tank 24 through the water separator 22 and the solvent pipe 23 and is then returned to the solvent tank 3 over an overflow partition 28. In this connection, the water separated by the water separator 22 is discharged from the system through a water pipe 29. Another dry cleaning process of using turpentine an oil series solvent is shown in Figs. 7 and 8. In general, the turpentine dry cleaning apparatus is composed of a washing and desolvating tank 100 shown in Fig. 7, which is similar to the treating tank shown in Fig. 6, and a drying exclusive tank 200 in Fig. 8 which is called a tumbler . In the washing and desolvating tank 100, the same procedure as the above mentioned washing processes 1 , 2 and 5 of using the other solvent is taken, whereby all the processes are over. Incidentally, the turpentine dry cleaning method generally contains no distillation process, and in many cases, the purification of the solvent 4 is carried out by using a filter 8a which is packed with an aliphatic acid adsorbent such as porous alumina and a decolorant such as activated carbon. Next, the desolvated clothes 2 are taken out by opening the door 1, and after the opening of a door 1a of the tumbler shown in Fig. 8, they are thrown into a treating tank 10a. In the tumbler, the outside air 20a is taken in through an inlet duct 19a by a fan 16 and is heated by an air heater 18, and the heated air is then delivered to the treating tank 10a. The solvent 4 in the clothes 2 is evaporated and is then discharged from the system to the outdoors through an outlet duct 19a, whereby drying is over. The general dry cleaning processes of using various solvents have now been described above, but at present, in the dry cleaner in which these solvents can be employed, the washing and drying method of using each solvent has been independently employed, whatever solvents are selected. Table 1 compares typical physical properties of the solvents often used presently. Further, Table 2 compares features, restrictions, faults and the like of the solvents regarding the dry cleaning on the basis of their physical properties shown in Table 1. In order to apply to presently diversified materials, processings and morphologies of clothes, it is necessary to use two kinds of perchloroethylene dry cleaner and Furon R113 dry cleaner, or three kinds of above cleaners and 1,1,1 trichloroethane dry cleaner. If two or more kinds of solvents are used in the conventional apparatus, purchase funds, occupation space, volume of facilities, and the like will be increased, and maintenace work will be complicated. These facts are an extremely large load to the cleaning trade. Fig. 5 compares general washing and drying processes in the cases of using perchloroethylene, 1,1,1 trichloroethane, turpentine oil series and Furon R113 which are now widely employed. As be definite from this drawing, all the methods, except for the Furon R113 method, take about 50 of the whole treatment time to accomplish drying, which fact is an obstacle to recent needs of shortening the treatment time. In addition thereto, the dry tumbling for a long period of time has bad influence on the chlothes at times, and for example, hairiness and shrinkage of the clothes tend to be caused thereby. The KB values in Table 1 are scales for representing relative dissolving powers of the solvents. An object of the present invention is to provide a dry cleaning method and apparatus which can apply to varied materials, processings, morphologies of clothes. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a dry cleaning method by which there can be overcome problems such as hairiness and shrinkage due to a long term drying in a conventional dry cleaning process. Constitutions of the present invention to accomplish the above mentioned objects are to be seen from the claims. According to the present invention constituted, the following effects can be obtained I Two or more solvents can be used in optional ratios in one dry cleaner, and thus the most proper washing method can be chosen for the greater part of materials, processings and morphologies of clothes. Further, it is possible to remarkably reduce troubles faulty washing, creases, shrinkages, discoloration, deformation, removal of adhesive materials, and the like regarding a washing technique. Also in points of occupation space, fund for facilities, volume of facilities and maintenace cost, the present invention has great advantages. II According to the dry cleaning method of the present invention, a drying time can be shortened noticeably and a bad influence of tumbling on clothes can be reduced.

Now, preferable embodiments of the present invention will be described in accordance with accompanying drawings Figs. 1 to 3 show a first embodiment of the present invention. For simplification, these drawings exemplarily show exclusive solvent tanks for two kinds of solvents and a fractionating device or a filter structure, but needless to say, they can serve for three or more kinds of solvents in all the same volume. With regard to differences between a fundamental embodiment of the present invention shown in Fig. 1 and the above mentioned constitution the conventional method shown in Fig. 6, a first difference is that a first solvent receiving tank 3 and a second solvent receiving tank 3a are disposed independently of each other and they are provided with exclusive valves 5 and 5a, respectively. A second difference therebetween is that valves 32, 32a which are adjustable in compliance with boiling points inherent in solvents or by a program control are disposed on a condensed solvent flow pipe 34 connecting to water separators 22, 22a solvent pipes 23, 23a and water pipes 29, 29a are provided and a safety valve 33 is additionally disposed on a condenser 27. A third difference is that a recovery passage 21 extending from an air cooler 17 is connected to the water separator 22 or 22a via a valve 30 or 30a and is connected to a distiller 15 via a non return valve 31. Except for these three differences, the structure in Fig. 1 is about the same as in Fig. 6. It can be naturally conceived to exclusively provide each pump 6 for each solvent, but for simplification, one pump 6 is here used in common. Fig. 2 shows a constitutional example of a condenser capable of completely recovering the two kinds of solvents by fractionation. A riser 36 on the distiller 15 Fig. 1 is connected to a first condenser 27a in which a cooling coil 41 is disposed. A temperature of this cooling coil 41 is adjusted to a level equal to or 2 to 3 C higher than a lower boiling point of the two solvents by means of a control system not shown. A gas pipe 37 is connected to the bottom of the condenser 27a and a liquid pipe 38 branches off from the gas pipe 37. This liquid pipe 38 is dipped in a tank 35 filled with a cooling water 40a in a low temperature cooling coil 40 and is further connected to the water separator 22a Fig. 1 . The above mentioned gas pipe 37 is connected to a second condenser 27b, where there is disposed the low temperature cooling coil 40 which has been cooled to a temprature enough to condense the low boiling point solvent. Further, a liquid pipe 39 extends downward from the bottom of the condenser 27b and is connected to the water separator 22 Fig. 1 . Fig. 3 is a constitutional example of specific filers containing a deoxidizer and a decolorant which have often been used in a turpentine oil series dry cleaning system. Filters 8a, 8a 1 and 8b in this drawing are all the especial filters, and these filters are equipped with exclusive valves 7a, 7a 1 and 7b and non return valves 50, 50a, 50b, respectively. Further, these filters are connected to a pipe in parallel. Next, reference will be made to a function of the embodiment thus constituted. First, in the case of separately using the two kinds of solvents without mixing them, washing and drying processes are much the same as in a conventional method Fig. 6 , and so a detailed description about them will be omitted here. It is however to be noted that opening and shutting of the valves 30 or 30a disposed on the recovery passage 21 extending from the air cooler 17 are controlled by the program control system not shown in response to the kinds of solvents so that the solvents 4, 4a may not be mixed with each other in the connected water separators 22, 22a and tanks 3, 3a. Also with regard to the distillation, the opening and shutting of the valves 32, 32a disposed on the condensed solvent flow pipe 34 extending from the condenser 27 are, controlled by the program control system not shown in compliance with the kinds of solvents, or alternatively these vavles 32, 32a are opened or shut by detecting a temperature of the solvent in the distiller 15 with the aid of a temperature sensor not shown in order to avoid mixing the solvents 4, 4a with each other. As a result, in both the cases of the drying and distillation, the solvents 4, 4a flow into the exclusive tanks 3, 3a, respectively. Incidentally, the one distiller is disposed in this embodiment, but needless to say, a plurality of distillers may be provided for the respective solvents. Next, detailed reference will be made to the case where the two kinds of solvents are positively mixed and used in an optional ratio. 1 The first solvent 4 is pumped up from the tank 3 via the valve 5 by means of the pump 6 and is delivered in a predetermined amount to the treating tank 10 through the valve 7 and the filter 8 or through the valve 9. Successively, the second solvent 4a is pumped up from the tank 3a via the valve 5a in like manner. 2 A treating drum 11 is slowly rotated, and a mixed solvent 4 4a is circulated through a circuit consisting of the treating tank 10, a button trap 12, a valve 13, the pump 6, the valve 7 and the filter 8 or the valve 9. 3 The mixed solvent 4 4a is discharged through a route consisting of the treating tank 10, the button trap 12, the valve 13, the pump 6, a valve 14 and the distiller 15. Afterward, the treating drum 11 is rotated at a high speed to centrifuge the solvent 4 4a present in the clothes 2, and the centrifuged solvent 4 4a is discharged in like manner. 4 The preceding processes 1 , 2 and 3 are repeated. Alternatively, after the preceding processes 1 and 2 have been repeated, the mixed solvent 4 4a is discharged to a third tank not shown through the treating tank 11, the button trap 12, the valve 13 and the pump 6. 5 The treating drum 11 is slowly rotated again, and air is circulated in the direction of an arrow 20 between the treating tank 10 and a recovery air duct 19 consisting of a fan 16, the air cooler 17 and an air heater 18, whereby the clothes 2 are dried. A solvent gas vaporized from the clothes 2 is condensed in the air cooler 17 and is delivered to the distiller 15 through the recovery circuit 21 containing the non return valve 31. 6 When drying has been over, dumpers 25, 26 are opened as depicted by dotted lines in the drawing, and fresh air is taken in through the dumper 25. Further, the uncondensed solvent gas whick has not been recovered by the air cooler 17 is discharged through the dumper 26 in order to take away the odor of the solvent in the clothes 2. 7 The mixed solvent 4 4a forwarded to the distiller 15 in the preceding processes 3 , 4 and 5 is distilled at a lower boiling point for example, of the solvent 4 of the respective solvents, and is caused to pass through a condenser 27. The mixed solvent condensed therein is then introduced into the water separator 22 via the valve 32 opened under a control of a distillation temperature sensor not shown , and is further returned to the solvent tank 3 through a solvent pipe 23. Next, as an amount of the solvent having the lower boiling point in the distiller 15 is reduced, a temperature of the mixed solvent progressively approaches a boiling point of the other solvent having a higher boiling point and the distillation of the latter begins. At this time, however, the distillation temperature sensor not shown operates in the same manner as described above, in order to open the valve 32a the valve 32 is shut , thereby recovering the high boiling point solvent 4a in the tank 3a in the same manner as described above a solvent of an intermediate component in the transition from the low boiling point solvent to the high boiling point solvent is as small as trace in experiments, and thus it has no problem in practice. In consequence, the intermediate solvent may be handled as the low or the high boiling point solvent . Now, the fractional system shown in Fig. 2 will be briefly described. The low boiling point solvent 4 evaporated in the distiller 15 Fig. 1 is, to begin with, introduced into the first condenser 27a, but it is not condensed therein, because a temperature of the cooling water in the cooling coil 41 is higher than the boiling point of the low boiling point solvent. Therefore, the latter is delivered through the gas pipe 37 to the second condenser 27b, wherein it is condensed by the low temperature cooling coil 40, and the condensed solvent then runs into the water separator 22 via the liquid pipe 39. When the high boiling point solvent begins to evaporate, the recovery of the solvent in the first condenser 27a becomes possible, and the condensed solvent runs into the water separator 22a through the liquid pipe 38. The tank 35 which has been filled with the cooling water 40a of the low temperature cooling coil 40 serves to cool the liquid pipe 38 dipped in the cooling water 40a. In the last place, with regard to the specific filer containing a deoxidizer and a decolorant which have often been used in the turpentine oil series dry cleaning system, its use example will be described briefly in reference to Fig. 3. In the case that washing is carried out by switching the two kinds of solvents so as to independently use them, the filters 8a 1 and 8b are used exclusively. For example, when the filter 8a 1 is employed for the first solvent 4, the valve 7a 1 alone is opened and the others are shut. The solvent 4 which has passed through the filter 8a 1 pushes the non return valve 50a and runs into the treating tank 10 Fig. 1 . In the case that the two kinds of mixed solvents are employed, the filter 8a alone is used in the same manner as described above so that the solvent components in the filters 8a 1, 8b may not be changed. This embodiment of the present invention is about a dry cleaning method in which the dry cleaning apparatus shown in Fig. 1 is used, and a description will be given in reference to Fig. 1. If the first and second solvents 4 and 4a are regarded as a low boiling point solvent and a high boiling point solvent, respectively, the latter 4a will be replaced with the former 4 in the dry cleaning apparatus during washing. The procedure of this replacement will be first described. 1 The high boiling point solvent 4a is pumped up from the tank 3 via the valve 5a by means of the pump 6 and is delivered in a predetermined amount to the treating tank 10 through the valve 7 and the filter 8 or through the valve 9. 2 A treating drum 11 is slowly rotated, and the high boiling point solvent 4a is circulated through a circuit consisting of the treating tank 10, the button trap 12, the valve 13, the pump 6, the valve 7, the filter 8 or the valve 9, in order to wash the clothes 2. 3 The solvent 4a is discharged through the treating tank 10, the button trap 12, the valve 13, the pump 6, the valve 14 and the distiller 15. Afterward, the treating drum 11 is rotated at a high speed to centrifuge the high boiling point solvent 4a present in the clothes 2, and the centrifuged solvent 4a is discharged in like manner. 4 The low boiling point solvent 4 is pumped up from the tank 3 via the valve 5a by means of the pump 6 and is delivered in a predetermined amount to the treating tank 10 through the valve 7 and the filter 8 or through the valve 9. 5 This step is the same as in the preceding paragraph 2 however, the high boiling point solvent 4a should be changed to the low boiling point solvent 4 . 6 This step is the same as in the preceding process 3 however, the high boiling point solvent 4a should be changed to the low boiling point solvent 4 . 7 The treating drum 11 is slowly rotated again, and air is circulated in the direction of an arrow 20 between the treating tank 10 and the recovery air duct 19 consisting of the fan 16, the air cooler 17 and the air heater 18, whereby the clothes 2 are dried. A solvent gas vaporized from the clothes 2 is condensed in the air cooler 17 and is then delivered to the distiller 15 through the recovery circuit 21 having the non return valve 31. 8 When drying has been over, dumpers 25, 26 are opened as depicted by dotted lines in the drawing, and fresh air is taken in through the dumper 25. Further, the uncondensed solvent gas which has not been recovered by the air cooler 17 is discharged through the dumper 26 in order to take away the odor of the solvent in the clothes 2. 9 The mixed solvent 4 4a forwarded to the distiller 15 in the preceding processes 3 , 6 and 7 is first distilled at a lower boiling point of the respective solvents, and is then caused to pass through the condenser 27. The mixed solvent condensed therein is afterward introduced into the water separator 22 via the valve 32 opened under a control of a distillation temperature sensor not shown , and is further returned to the solvent tank 3 through the solvent pipe 23. Next, as an amount of the solvent having the lower boiling point in the distiller 15 is reduced, a temperature of the mixed solvent progressively approaches a boiling point of the other solvent 4a having a higher boiling point and the distillation of the latter 4a begins. At this time, however, the distillation temperature sensor not shown operates in the same manner as described above, in order to open the valve 32a the valve 32 is shut , thereby recovering the high boiling point solvent 4a in the tank 3a in the same manner as described above a solvent of an intermediate component in the transition from the low boiling point solvent to the high boiling point solvent is as small as trace in experiments, and thus it has no problem in practice. In consequence, the intermediate solvent may be handled as the low or the high boiling point solvent . Next, brief reference will be made to a procedure of replacing the high boiling point solvent 4a with the low boiling point solvent 4 immediately before drying. 1 A washing process makes progress in about the same manner as in the preceding processes 1 to 4 regarding Fig. 6 the tank 3 and the solvent 4 in Fig. 6 should be changed to the tank 3a and the high boiling point solvent 4a . 2 The low boiling point solvent 4 is pumped up from the tank 3 via the valve 5 by means of the pump and is delivered in a predetermined amount to the treating tank 10 through the route consisting of the valve 7 and the valve 9. The subsequent processes are all the same as in the process 6 et seq. regarding the above mentioned solvent replacement during washing.
