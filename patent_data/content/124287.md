## Description
The present invention relates to a method and test composition for the determination of hydrogen peroxide, and more particularly, to a method for the determination of hydrogen peroxide by reacting hydrogen peroxide with a novel chromogen as a hydrogen donor in the presence of peroxidase and determining the amount of pigment formed. In the medical, diagnostic and biochemical arts, numerous substrates are determined by oxidizing the substrate with an oxidase and determining the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced. For example, cholesterol is determined by reaction with cholesterol oxidase and subsequent determination of the hydrogen peroxide produced, by reaction of the product hydrogen peroxide with a peroxidase in the presence of a chromogen which forms a pigment, and measuring the absorbancy of the reaction solution. In such processes, 4 aminoantipyrine hereinafter referred to as 4AA and phenol, 4AA and N,N dimethylaniline, 4AA and N ethyl N β hydroxyethyl m toluidine, 3 methylbenzothiazolin hydrazone and N,N diethylaniline, 4AA and N ethyl N 3 methylphenyl N acetylethylenediamine hereinafter referred to as EMAE are commonly used as the chromogen or chromogenic mixture. Also known for this purpose are the chromogens disclosed in EP A 0 045 220, namely compounds of the formulae and where Z represents hydroxyl, amino or substituted amino, Y represents an oxygen atom or sulfur atom, R₁ represents hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, amino or mono substituted amino, R₂ represents hydrogen, hydroxyl, alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, amino, alkylamino, or alkoxy, R₃, R₄, R₅ and R₆ represent hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, acyl, aryl, halogen, sulfo, nitro, carboxyl, hydroxyl, hydroxyalkyl or alkoxy, R₃ and R₄ or R₅ and R₆ may form alkenylene, and X represents S , O , or R₇ and R₈ represent hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl or aryl. In accordance with the present invention, similar chromogenic derivatives of diphenylamine, phenoxazin and phenothiazin have been found which are superior in sensitivity and which are not affected by components often found These chromogens are compounds of the following formulae I and II and where Z represents oxygen or sulfur or and Within the above definitions, the groups of formula III to VII are wherein Substituted amino in the above definitions of R₁ and R₂, means amino substituted by alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, hydroxyalkyl, cycloalkyl, acyl, aralkyl, acylalkyl, carboxyl, alkoxy, sulfo or sulfoalkyl.

The absorbancy of the resultant coloured solution is measured at a wavelength in the visible or near infra red ray region, e.g. in the range 600 to 900 nm. The amount of hydrogen peroxide in the sample is then calculated by comparison with a standard curve. The reaction is usually carried out at a temperature in the range 5 to 50 C, preferably 25 to 40 C, in a buffer solution having a pH of 2 to 10, and is usually completed within a few minutes. The chromogen is preferably used in an amount of from 10 to 1000 mole equivalents relative to hydrogen peroxide. The peroxidase is used in a concentration of 0.1 to 1000 IU ml. As buffers, Good buffer, phosphate buffer, tris HCl buffer, succinate buffer, citrate buffer, acetate buffer, etc. may be used, at concentrations of from 0.005 to 2 mol l. A small amount of phenol or EMAE can be added to the reaction system to activate the peroxidase and to promote pigment formation.

The adverse effect of serum components such as bilirubin, cysteine and uric acid is measured by adding 20 µg 3 ml bilirubin, 20 µg 3 ml of crysteine or 10 µg 3 ml of uric acid to the sample. The symbol means that the effect is 3 to 6 , means that the effect is 6 to 20 , means that the effect is more than 20 , and means that the effect is less than 3 . The degree of the colour in the reagent blank is given in comparison with that of the colour obtained by using Leuco Bindschedler s Green LBG as representative prior art chromogen. The following codes are used The results show the better reactivity of the present chromogens as hydrogen donors and their relative insensitivity to contaminants such as bilirubin, cysteine and uric acid. The chromogens of the present invention are obtained by the condensation reaction of Leuco bases, obtained by the reduction of diphenyl amines, thiazine or oxazine pigments, with a benzhydrol in the presence of sulfuric acid. The condensation reaction is carried out at 30 to 100 C for 1 to 100 hours. The reaction mixture is then added to an organic solvent such as n octanol, capable of crystallizing out the desired chromogen. The crude crystals are then re dissolved in an organic solvent, such as methanol, and the solution subjected to column chromatography through a silica gel column to recover the desired compound. The preparation of the compounds listed in Tables 1 and 2 is illustrated below.

The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 C for 2 to 3 hours. At the end of the reaction, n octanol was added to crystallize the condensation product and the crude crystal product was dissolved in a small amount of methanol. The solution was then subjected to column chromatography in a silica gel column and eluted with a 2 1 mixture of chloroform and n hexane.

Distilled water was then added to the reaction mixture in equal amount. After vigorous stirring, the water layer was separated and evaporated to dryness. The dried product was then reacted with benzhydrol and 4,4 dichlorobenzhydrol, respectively, in a weight ratio of 2 1 in 60 sulfuric acid. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 C for 2 to 3 hours. The same purification procedures as described in 1 above were followed except that different polarity solvents were used following initiation of the elution with chloroform. Compound Nos. 33 and 34 are obtained using solvents of low polarity. Compounds Nos. 31 and 32 are subsequently eluted using solvents of higher polarity.

The hydrogen peroxide producing reaction and pigment producing reaction may be conducted stepwise or more preferably, simultaneously by adding to the sample all the components necessary for the determination of hydrogen peroxide and conducting all the reactions in one step, and measuring the absorbancy of the reaction solution. For this purpose, the various components include the oxidase for the substrate to be determined, a peroxidase, and the chromogen I or II . A buffer solution and surfactant, etc., may be added, if necessary.
