# Self referencing position switch.

## Abstract
The swith, particularly adapted to respond to the posi tion of an automobile gear shift lever, is responsive to the position of a movable external member relative to a statio nary member and includes a pair of housing sections one of which is attached to the stationary member and the other of which 12b defines a track 44 for a movable switch member 72 which follows the movements of the external member and is arranged to close the switch at a selected location along the track 44 . The two housing sections are movable relative to one another in more or less the direction of the track so that by engaging the movable switch member 72 against one or the other end of the track and moving the housing sections relative to one another, the selected loca tion on the track can be correlated with a selection position of the movable member.
