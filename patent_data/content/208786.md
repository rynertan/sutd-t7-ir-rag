# METHOD OF MOUNTING SHELL TYPE MILLING CUTTER.

## Abstract
The area of a closely contacting surface of a shell type milling cutter 1 with respect to a milling arbor 3 is in creased to heighten the rigidity and mounting strength of the milling cutter and thereby enable a high speed cutting operation and a very simple replacement of the milling cutter. A tapering bore is formed in the shell type milling cutter 1 , and a bush 2 is inserted in a clearance between the tapering bore and a mounting shaft of the milling arbor 3 . A cotter 4 is inserted into cotter bores 1c , 2c , 3b formed in the milling cutter 1 , bush 2 and milling arbor 3 , to fit the bush 2 under pressure and thereby fix the milling arbor 3 and milling cutter 1 .
