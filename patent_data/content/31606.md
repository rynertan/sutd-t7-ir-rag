## Description
PROCESS FOR TEE CO PRODUCTION OF CARBOXYLIC ACIDS AND CARBOXYLIC ACID ESTERS The present invention relates to a process for the co production of carboxylic acids and carboxylic acid esters from carboxylic acid esters having one carbon atom less in the molecule, carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a catalytic system. The invention relates in particular to a process for the co production of acetic acid and ethyl acetate from methyl acetate under mild process conditions. Carboxylic acid esters produced according to the process according to the present invention are thus homologues of the carboxylic acid esters used as starting materials. The present invention also relates to a catalytic system which enables homologation to occur as well as to carboxylic acids and carboxylic acid esters obtained in accordance with the process according to the present invention.The present invention is of particular interest in that it allows the synthesis of carboxylic acid esters together with carboxylic acids from readily accessible carboxylic acid esters such as methyl acetate or ethyl acetate under mild process conditions. The production of carboxylic acid esters via homologation has already been described in the literature. For instance, it is known from Dutch published patent application 7807520 that carboxylic acid esters especially ethyl acetate from methyl acetate can be prepared at elevated temperatures at a pressure of at least 100 bar, preferably between 200 and 1500 bar in the presence of cobalt, rhodium, ruthenium or iron or salts thereof.Apart from the fact that very high pressures have to be applied in order to get a reasonable conversion, the process as described in the Dutch published patent application 707520, also has the disadvantage that water is produced as the co proct. It will be clear that water can cause a substantial hydrolysis of the esters present in the reaction mixture whether being present as product or as starting material . Even when very high, unattractive pressures e.g. well over 1000 bar are used substantial amounts of alkanols are produced. It is further known from German Offenlegungsschrift 2733663 that the homologation of methyl acetate or of its precursor dimethyl ether can be carried out using a ruthenium carbonyl compound and an iodide or bromide promoter at elevated temperatures and pressures. The process as described in the German Offenlegungsschrift also has to be carried out at very high pressures well over 200 bar and substantial amounts of other products including not only alkanols but also methane are formed. It is known from Dutch published patent application 7602096 that methyl acetate can be converted using carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a specific catalyst comprising a Group VIII noble metal compound and a halogen especially iodine source into acetic acid and ethylidene diacetate. However, ethyl acetate the homologation product according to the process according to the present invention is not even mentioned as a by product. It has now been found that carboxylic acids and carboxylic acid esters can be co produced from carboxylic acid esters having one carbon atom less in the molecule, carbon monoxide and hydrogen under very mild process conditions using a specific catalytic system. The present invention relates to a process for the coproduct ion of carboxylic acids according to the general formulaeR1 COOH and R2 COOH and carboxylic acid esters according to the general formulae R1 COOCH2R2 and R2 COOCH2R1 wherein the groups 1 and 2 with may 2R and R which may be the same or different each represent an alkyl group having of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms which may be substituted by one or more inert substituents such as fluorine or chlorine containing moieties or hydroxy, alkoxy or alkanoyl groups or an aryl, alkaryl or aralkyl group which may be substituted by one or more inert substituents such as fluorine or chlorine containing moieties or alkoxy or alkanoyl groups whilst R may also represent a hydrogen atom, characterized in that a carboxylic acid ester according to the general formula 1 COOR2 and or an ether according to the general formula R30R wherein R1 and R2 are as defined hereinbefore and R3 and R4, which may be the same or different each represent an alkyl group having of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms which may be substituted by one or more inert substituents such as fluorine or chlorine containing moieties or hydroxy, alkoxy or alkanoyl groups or an aryl, alkaryl or aralkyl group which may be substituted by one or more inert substituents such as fluorine or chlorine containing moieties or alkoxy or alkanoyl groups is reacted with carbon monoxide and hydrogen at elevated temperature and pressure in the presence of a catalytic system which comprises a ruthenium compound, a Group II metal iodide and or bromide or a transitionmetal iodide and or bromide and a further Group VIII metal compound. It should be noted that the composition of the reaction product mixture will be governed by the choice of the starting carboxylic acid esters and or ethers. For instance, when starting materials are used, wherein the groups R1 and R2 are identical, such as in methyl acetate, dimethyl ether and ethyl propionate, the reaction product mixture will normally contain only the carboxylic acid ester homologue and the appropriate acid. When starting materials are used wherein the groups R1 and R2 are not identical, a more complex reaction product mixture will be obtained which comprises normally at least two carboxylic acid ester homologues and two appropriate carboxylic acids. For instance, when ethyl acetate is used as the starting material the reaction product mixture comprises propyl acetate, ethyl propionate, propionic acid and acetic acid. It will be appreciated that any carboxylic acid ester homologue produced according to the present process can serve as starting material in the process according to the present invention thus forming the next carboxylic acid ester homologue s and the appropriate carboxylic acid s . Since also carboxylic acids are produced according to the process according to the present invention, it cannot be excluded that transesterification reactions, i.e. reactions between carboxylic acid s produced and starting carboxylic acid esters or between different carboxylic acid esters, may also occur under the prevailing reaction conditions. It will be clear that transesterification reactions do not alter the product composition when the starting material comprises compounds wherein R1 and R2 are identical, but may alter the product composition when the groups R1 and R2 are not identical. For the purpose of the present invention carboxylic acids and carboxylic acid esters whether obtained via a further homologation of produced carboxylic acid ester or by virtue of a transesterification process under the prevailing conditions are considered to be within the scope of the present invention. From the above it will be clear that preference is given to processes wherein starting materials are used wherein the 1 R1 and 2 groups R1 and R2 are identical since a less complex reaction mixture will be obtained. The process according to the present invention is of special interest for the co production of acetic acid and ethyl acetate from methyl acetate according to the equation EMI4.1 since the products can be obtained with high selectivity and close to the stoichiometrically expected ratio. This is of special interest when the process according to the present invention is part of an integrated process, wherein acid produced for instance acetic acid is to be recycled in the process. Moreover, the process according to the present invention can be carried out conveniently at surprisingly low pressures, e.g. pressures well below 100 bar can be used advantageously. The present invention also relates to a catalytic system which enables homologation to occur which comprises a ruthenium compound, a Group II metal iodide and or bromide or a a transition metal iodide and or bromide and a further Group VIII metal compound. Starting materials which can be used conveniently in the process according to the present invention for the production of acid s and ester homologues corresponding with the starting ester s comprise compounds according to the general formulae R1 COOR2 and or R3OR4, wherein R1, R2, R3, and R4 which may be the same or different, each represent an alkyl group having of from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, or an aryl, alkaryl or aralkyl group having up to 12 carbon atoms whilst R may also represent a hydrogen atom. Preference is given to the use of compounds according to the general formulae R1 COOR2 and or R3OR4, wherein R1, R2, R3 and R are the same and represent an alkyl group having of from 1 to 12 carbon atoms or an aryl, alkaryl or aralkyl group having up to 12 carbon atoms.Most preferred starting materials are methyl acetate and dimethyl ether. When ethers according to the general formula R3OR4 are used as starting materials in the process according to the present invention, it would appear that these compounds will be converted primarily into the corresponding esters by the introduction of a carbon monoxide moiety into the molecule which molecule may then be subjected to the homologation reaction according to the present invention. If desired, the reaction according to the present invention can be carried out in two stages when an ether is used as the starting material. Firstly, the ether will be converted into the corresponding ester which in its turn, in the same or in a different vessel, will be converted into the final products. Also mixtures of carboxylic acid esters and or ethers can be used as starting materials. It has been found that the catalytic system to be used in the process according to the present invention is rather critical in that the presence of a ruthenium compound, a Group II metal iodide and or bromide or a transition metal iodide and or bromide and a further Group VIII metal compound is mandatory for the selective and rapid co production of esters and acids. For instance, from comparative Example A it will be clear that when carrying out the process according to the present invention but omitting the ruthenium compound, only a small amount of ester will be produced together with a large excess of the corresponding acid. Using a rhodium trichloride methyl iodide catalytic system comparable with the reaction disclosed in Dutch published patent application 7602096 under the mild reaction conditions according to the present invention no ester could be found but a fair amount of ethylidene diacetate was obtained together with acetic acid see comparative Example B . Ruthenium compounds which can be used conveniently in the process according to the present invention comprise ruthenium III chloride, ruthenium III chloride trihydrate, ruthenium IV chloride, ruthenium III bromide, the ruthenium oxides organic ruthenium salts such as ruthenium III formate, ruthenium III acetate, ruthenium III propionate, ruthenium III butyrate, ruthenium pentacarbonyl, trirutheniumdodecacarbonyl and mixed ruthenium halocarbonyls such as bis rutheniumtricarbonyl dibromide , and other organoruthenium complexes. Further Group VIII metal compounds which can be used together with a ruthenium compound as described hereinabove comprise especially rhodium and palladium compounds although other Group VIII metal compounds can also be used. Examples of suitable rhodium compounds comprise rhodium oxide, rhodium III hydroxide, rhodium III chloride, rhodium III chloride trihydrate, rhodium III bromide, rhodium III iodide as well as the corresponding pyridine and phosphine complexes such as tris pyridine rhodium III chloride or dichloro bis triphenylphosphine rhodium, rhodium III formate, rhodium III acetate, rhodium III butyrate, rhodium III naphthenate, dirhodium octacarbonyl, tetrarhodium dodecacarbonyl, hexarhodium hexadecacarbonyl, rhodium dicarbonylacetylacetonate and other organorhodium complexes.Preference is given to the use of rhodium III chloride trihydrate. Examples of suitable palladium compounds comprise palladium chloride, palladium chloride dihydrat e, palladium bromide, palladium iodide, palladium oxide, or an organic palladium salt or complex such as palladium formate, palladium acetate, palladium butyrate and palladium acetylacetonate. Preferred palladium compounds to be used in the process according to the present invention are palladium chloride, palladium chloride dihydrate and palladium acetate. The ratio of ruthenium compound and further Group VIII compound to be applied is not critical and can vary between wide limits, e.g. between 20 1 and 1 20. Preference being given to the use of the compounds in a ratio between 5 1 and 1 5. Good results can be obtained using the ruthenium compound in half the molar amount of the further Group VIII metal employed. The amount of ruthenium compound and further Group VIII compound to be used is not critical and any amount which exerts catalytic activity can be used. Amounts as low as 0.001 w, calculated on carboxylic acid ester or ether to be converted can be used, preference being given to amounts in the range of from 0.01 10 w, most preferably between 0.05 5 w. Metal iodides and or bromides which can be used compriseGroup II iodides and or bromides as well as transition metal iodides and or bromides. Examples of metal compounds which can be conveniently used comprise magnesium bromide and or iodide, chromium III iodide, cobalt II iodide, cobalt II bromide, nickel II iodide, nickel II bromide, copper II iodide, copper II bromide, zinc iodide and zinc bromide. Preferred metal iodides and bromides to be used are cobalt II iodide, zinc iodide and zinc bromide. Normally iodides are preferred over the corresponding bromides. It should be noted that use can also be made of combinations of metal salts which can give rise to in situ formation of GroupII iodides or bromides or transition metal iodides or bromides, e.g. a mixture of zinc acetate and an alkali ne earth metal iodide or bromide. The amount of metal iodide and or metal bromide to be used can also vary between wide limits. In general, the use of an excess of metal iodide and or metal bromide over the other metal compounds in the catalytic system is preferred. Suitable molar ratios of metal iodide and or metal bromide to other metal compounds are in the range of from 200 to 0.1, ratios in the range of from 50 to 10 being preferred. It has been found that other iodine containing compounds such as the alkyliodides, in particular methyliodide, can be used in addition to the metal iodide and or metal bromide as defined hereinbefore. The amount of additional iodine containing compound is not critical. Normally the additional iodine containing compound will be used in about the same amount as the metal iodide applied. It should be noted however, that the mere presence of an alkyl iodide, such as methyliodide in the absence of a metal iodide and or metal bromide as defined hereinbefore is insufficient under otherwise similar reaction conditions to obtain the carboxylic acid ester and the acid in the stoichiometrically expected ratio. From comparative Example B it will be clear that under such conditions acetic acid is produced in much to high an amount. If desired, the process according to the present invention can be carried out in the additional presence of organic compounds which are capable of forming a co ordination compound with the Group VIII metal moieties present in the catalytic system according to the present invention. Suitable compounds comprise organo phosphorous, organo arsenic, organic antimony, organo nitrogen, organo sulphur and organo oxygen compounds.Preferred compounds having co ordinative properties are organophosphorus compounds and organo nitrogen compounds. Also compounds containing both phosphorus and oxygen atoms or nitrogen and oxygen atoms can be suitably applied. Examples of organo nitrogen compounds which can be used conveniently comprise pyrrole, alkyl substituted pyrroles, pyrrolidine, alkyl substituted pyrrolidines, pyridine, alkyl substituted pyridines, piperidines, alkyl substituted piperidines, pyrimidine, alkyl substituted pyrimidines, pyrazine, benztriazole, tetraethylenediamine, 1,10 phenantroline, alkyl substituted 1,10 phenantrolines, morpholine and alkylsubstituted morpholines. Preference is given to the use of pyridine and alkyl substituted pyridines such as the various picolines, e.g. alphapicoline. Examples of organo phosphorus compounds which can be used conveniently comprise tertiary phosphines according to the general formula PR5R6R7, wherein R5, R6 and R7, which may be the same or different, each represent an alkyl, cycloalkyl or arylgroup having up to 10 carbon atoms. Preferred organo phosphorus compounds comprise trimethyl phosphine, triethylphosphine, tri n butylphosphine and triphenyl phosphine. Also the corresponding organophosphites according to the general formula OPR5R6R7 wherein R5, 6 art 7H and R7 are as defined herein before can be used as co ordination compounds. The amount of organic compound additionally to be used in the process according to the present invention is generally related to the amount of Group VIII metal compounds present in the reaction mixture. Higher as well as lower amounts can also be used. Therefore amounts ranging of from 0.1 100 times the total molar amount of Group VIII metal compounds present can be suitably applied. Preference is given to amounts up to 10 times the molar amount of Group VIII metal compounds present. It should be stated, however, that the presence of such co ordination compounds is optional. The process according to the present invention can be carried out using a wide range of temperatures. Temperatures up to 3000 C can be suitably applied. Preference is given to temperatures in the range of from 50 C to 200 C, most preferred temperatures are in the range between 1250C and 175 C. The process according to the present invention can be carried out using low pressures, e.g. pressures as low as 5 bar. Pressures in the range of from 20 to 100 bar are preferred. Higher pressures, e.g. pressures as high as 1000 bar can be applied, but they do not contribute substantially whilst the investment and energy costs involved increase considerably without compensating substantially in terms of product yield and or selectivity. According to the reaction equation carbon monoxide and hydrogen are consumed in a molar ratio of 1 1. It has been found, however, that without any substantial disadvantage wider molar ratios, e.g. ratios of from 1 10 to 10 1 can be applied.Preference is given to ratios carbon monoxide hydrogen being in the range of from 1 0.5 to 1 2. The reaction time is not critical and will depend largely on the temperature and pressure applied. Reaction times of from 1 to 20 hours are sufficient, preference being given to reaction times in the range of from 5 to 15 hours. Shorter or longer reaction times are not excluded. The process according to the present invention can also be carried out in the presence of a solvent. Suitable solvents comprise carboxylic acids such as acetic acid or propanoic acid carboxylic acid esters, such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methylpropionate or ethyl propionate being used as solvent as well as starting material , and cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, 1,4 dioxane, 1,3 dioxane and the dioxolanes. Also linear or branched dialkyl ethers used in excess as starting material may be regarded as solvent for the process according to the present invention. Suitable dialkylethers comprise dimethyl ether, diethyl ether and methyl t butyl ether. Other compounds which can be used as solvent in the process according to the present invention comprise a cyclic sulphones and sulphoxides. Examples of such com pounds are dimethylsulphone, sulpholane, 2 methyl sulpholane, 3 methyl sulpholane, dimethylsulphoxide and diethyl sulphoxide. Good results can be obtained when carboxylic acids such as acetic acid are used as solvent. The amount of solvent which can be used in the process is not critical and can vary between wide limits. Volumes of solvent as high as 50 times the volume of the reagents can be suitably applied. It has been found that the mild conditions according to the present invention even tolerate the presence of some water in the reaction medium. Although the presence of water is not preferred, amounts of up to 15 w, based on total solvent, can be applied. The process according to the present invention can be carried out in the liquid phase as well as in the gaseous phase.Preference is given to a liquid phase which enables a convenient introduction of carbon monoxide and hydrogen into the reaction vessel. If desired, the carbon monoxide and hydrogen can be introduced together into the reaction vessel. The process according to the present invention can be carried out batchwise, semi continuously or continuously. The reaction may comprise one or more autoclaves or one or more reactor tubes which walls are made of or coated with inert materials. The process according to the present invention is also of interest in that it can be integrated with known processes, either for the production of the starting materials i.e.carboxylic acid esters or the corresponding ethers or for the conversion of the carboxylic acid esters produced into other products, e.g. by transesterification processes.For instance, when the present process produces ethyl acetate, it can be integrated with a process for the preparation of methyl acetate from acetic acid and methanol using an acidic catalyst. Since the present process produces also acetic acid, that compound can be partially recycled to serve as feedstock for the preparation of methyl acetate.If desired, the present process can also be integrated with a transesterification process, wherein ethylacetate is transesterified with methanol to give methyl acetate which can be recycled to serve as partial feedstock for the present process and ethanol which can either be sold as such or converted into other products such as ethylene. In such a case acetic acid and or methyl acetate can be removed from the system in an amount equimolar with ethanol produced.From the above, it will be clear that the net chemical reaction when combining the present process and the preparation of methyl acetate from methanol and acetic acid amounts to the conversion of methanol using carbon monoxide and hydrogen into ethyl acetate and water. When also the transesterification as described hereinbefore is taken into account the net reaction amounts to the conversion of methanol using carbon monoxide and hydrogen into methyl acetate and or acetic acid, ethanol and water. The reaction products may be worked up by techniques known in the art. For instance, the reaction product mixture may be subjected to a fractional distillation to separate the carboxylic acid ester s and the acid s produced. If desired further purification treatment can be given to one or both separated products. The products obtained by the process according to the present invention can either be used as such, e.g. as solvent or as reagent, or can be used as intermediates in further chemical reactions, e.g. ethyl acetate can be hydrolyzed using known techniques to ethanol. The present invention will now be illustrated by means of the following non limiting Examples. EXAMPLE I The experiment was carried out in a 300 ml magnet driven autoclave of Hastelloy C which contained o.6 mol methyl acetate, 1 mmol rhodium III chloride trihydrate, 0.5 mmol ruthenium III chloride trihydrate, 30 mmol zinc iodide and 3 mmol alphapicoline.

The conversion rate was about 40 g g rhodium hr including dimethyl ether . The reaction product mixture contained 9.7 w ethyl acetate and 14.0 w acetic acid and 70 w methylacetate.EXAMPLE XIII a The autoclave described in Example XII was charged with methyl formate 0.66 mol , 0.1 mmol rhodium III chloride trihydrate, 1 mmol ruthenium III chloride trihydrate, 40 mmol zinc iodide and 3 mmol alpha picoline. The reaction was carried out at 155 C during 15 hrs using an initial carbon monoxide partial pressure of 15 bar and an initial hydrogen partial pressure of 30 bar. The reaction product mixture contained 39 w methyl acetate, 4.6 Xw ethyl acetate, 6.o w acetic acid and a considerable quantity of formic acid together with water and carbon dioxide decomposition products of formic acid .b The experiment described in Example XIIIa was repeated using half the amount of zinc iodide. The reaction was performed at a carbon monoxide hydrogen ratio of 1 2. It appears that a total pressure of 12 bar carbon monoxide hydrogen had been consumed. The reaction product mixture contained 23.8 w methyl acetate, 1.5 Xw ethyl acetate, 12.9 w acetic acid, 8.7 1w formic acid and 5.0 w pater decomposition of formic acid .COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE A The experiment described in this Comparative Example A was carried out by charging the 300 ml magnet driven autoclave with 0.6 mol methyl acetate, 1 mmol rhodium III chloride trihydrate, 30 mmol zinc iodide and 3 mmol alpha picoline. The autoclave was further charged with carbon monoxide initial pressure 15 bar and hydrogen initial pressure 30 bar .The reaction vessel was kept at 155 C during 15 hours. From gas liquid chromatography it appeared that 28.8 7w acetic acid had been formed but only 8.8 7w ethyl acetate. In the absence of a ruthenium compound, the desired ratio ester acid 1 2 was not reached at all. By slightly changing the original pressures i.e. starting with an initial carbon monoxide pressure of 20 bar and an initial hydrogen pressure of 20 bar and at a temperature of 1600C under otherwise similar conditions, even more acetic acid had been formed 39.6 w whereas the amount of ethyl acetate produced had been halved 4.5 w . Also 1.7 lew ethylidene diacetate appeared to be present in the reaction mixture.COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE B The experiment described in Comparative Example A was repeated with the exception that also 0.5 mmol ruthenium III chloride trihydrate was present and that zinc iodide had been replaced by 60 mmol methyliodide. The reaction was performed for 5 hours at 155 C. The reaction mixture as determined by gas liquid chromatography contained a large amount of acetic acid 31 8 w and by products were produced in a larger amount than ethylacetate ethylidene diacetate 0.7 w, ethanol 2.0 7w, dimethylether 4 lw and propionic acid 5.3 w compared with 7.1 w ethyl acetate .COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE C The experiment described in Comparative Example A was repeated with the exception that zinc iodide had been replaced with methyliodide 30 mmol . The reaction was carried out at 150 C during 15 hours starting from an initial carbon monoxide pressure of 20 bar and an initial hydrogen pressure of 20 bar. The reaction mixture did not contain ethyl acetate but contained acetic acid 15.7 w as well as a fair amount of ethylidene diacetate 9low . COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE D The 300 ml magnet driven autoclave made from Hastelloy C was charged with o.6 mol methyl acetate, 0.7 mmol palladium acetate, 0.35 mmol ruthenium III chloride trihydrate, 14 mmol methyl iodide and 4 mmol triphenylphosphine. The reaction was carried out at 135 C during 15 hours starting at an initial carbon monoxide pressure of 20 bar and an initial hydrogen pressure of 20 bar. Only a trace of ethyl acetate 0.8 w could be detected in the reaction mixture using gas liquid chromatography. The main products obtained were acetic acid 7.9 w and ethylidene diacetate 6.3 ow . COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE E The autoclave referred to in Comparative Example D was charged with o.6 mol methyl acetate, 1 mmol rhodium III chloride trihydrate, 20 mmol zinc acetate, 40 mmol methyl iodide and 3 mmol alpha picoline. The autoclave was further charged with carbon monoxide initial pressure 20 bar and hydrogen initial pressure 20 bar . The reaction was carried out at 150 C for 15 hours. The reaction mixture contained a fair amount of acetic acid 25.5 w but only a small amount of ethylacetate 3.3 Sew and even more ethylidene diacetate 4.0 w . This experiment indicates that the combined presence of methyliodide and a zinc saltin the absence of a ruthenium compound is insufficient to obtain the desired product ratio. When under otherwise similar conditions a double amount of zinc acetate was used the production of acetic acid dropped considerably to 8.9 w and only a small increase in the production of ethyl acetate to 3.9 w was found.COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE F The experiment described in Comparative Example A was repeated, with the exception that 1 mmol ruthenium III chloride trihydrate was used instead of 1 mmol rhodium III chloride trihydrate. From gas liquid chromatography it appeared that 3.5 w acetic acid had been formed and 2.5 low ethyl acetate 0.5 low dimethylether and 0.2 lw ethanol being the main by products. This ComparativeExample clearly demonstrates the absence of a beneficial effect when a further Group VIII metal compound is not present.COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE G a The experiment described in Comparative Example B was repeated using 56 mmol lithium iodide instead of methyliodide. The reaction was performed at 1550C during 5 hours at an initial carbon monoxide partial pressure of 15 bar and an initial hydrogen partial pressure of 30 bar.The reaction product mixture contained a large amount of acetic acid 64 w . Ethyl acetate had been produced in 11.9 lw, thus giving an ester acid ratio of 1 7. Some ethanol about 0.5 w had also been produced. b The experiment described in Comparative Example Ga was repeated using half the amount of lithium iodide.Having applied otherwise similar conditions, the reaction mixture contained 7.5 w ethyl acetate, 25 tw acetic acid and ethylidene diacetate had been co produced in a fair amount about 4.6 w . The ester and acid had been produced in a 1 5 ratio.c The experiment described in Comparative Example Ga was repeated by heating the reaction mixture at 1350C for 5 hours. The reaction mixture contained 7.8 w ethyl acetate and 49 w acetic acid. The ester and the acid had even been produced in a 1 9 ratio.
