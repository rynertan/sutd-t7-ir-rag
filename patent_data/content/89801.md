# Optical element and optical resin composition for the preparation thereof.

## Abstract
Problems of birefringence can be avoided in an optical element including an optical resin composition consisting essentially of certain polycarbonates having a melt flow rate of more than or equal to 5.0 g 10 min. as measured based on ISO R 1133 Standard at 230 C and 5 kgf., and having a glass transition point of more than or equal to 100 C. The polycarbonates preferably include major repeating units having the formula I or II . Formula I O Ar₁ R Ar₂ O Formula II O A R O wherein Ar₁ and AR₂ each represent an arylene group or a cycloalkylene group R represents an alkylene group, a cycloalkylene group, O , O Ar₃ O , S , SO , SO₂ , SO₂ Ar₃ SO₂ , R₁ Ar₄ R₁ , O R₁ O ,
