# LIQUID DETERGENT COMPOSITION

## Abstract
Aqueous, built liquid detergent compositions compris ing an alkylaryl sulphonate and an alkylether sulphate as the detergent materials, and a phosphate builder show an irreversible increase in viscosity when subjected to high shearing action. The inclusion in such compositions of a certain level of a nonionic detergent surfactant according to the present invention enables the use of high shearing action, necessary to achieve the required physical stability, without an irreversible increase of the viscosity.
