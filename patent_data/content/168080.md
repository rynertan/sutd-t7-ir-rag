## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF PROTECTED PROTEINThe invention relates to a process for the preparation of protected protein, to animal feedstuff including the protected protein and to the use of the products obtained for feeding animals.It is well known that micro organisms present in the rumen and reticulum of ruminants degrade the proteinaceous material added with the feed for their own growth and their own increase to form urea and ammonia, which are partly removed with the urine and also with exhaled air and cannot therefore be utilized by the animal. In this way a considerable portion of the proteinaceous material added with the feed is lost and therefore does not benefit the animal.Therefore proposals have been made to protect the proteinaceous material in some way or other from degradation in the rumen. As an indication for the effectiveness of the protection against premature degradation of the protein, the reduction of the solubility of the protein can be used. To yield a suitable feedstuff for ruminants it is further essential that the protection of the protein does not adversely affect the digestibility thereof in the intestinal canal.In DE PS 1 692 412 The Commonwealth Scientific andIndustrial Research Organization of Australia it has been proposed to treat the surface of proteinaceous particles with an aldehyde or provide them with a coating of certain polymers to form surfaces which are unstable at a pH of 4 and relatively stable at a pH exceeding 5, The aldehydes that are mentioned include ethanedial, pentanedial and particularly methanal.In DE PS 1 692 441 Institut de la Recherche Agronomi que, France it has been proposed to manufacture feedstuffs which have been protected against bacterial deamination by treating the feedstuffs, in an aqueous medium, with tanning matter, such as tannic acid, so long that they virtually contain no soluble nitrogen and the reaction product is then dried at temperatures below 80VC. DE PS 2 451 509 Milkivit Werke A.Trouw GmbH claims the protection of the surface of protein based feed materials by treating the feed materials with ethanal, ethanedial, pentanedial and methanal or with an aldehyde separating substance, such as hexamethylene tetramine, in the presence of amorphous silicic acid.These processes present certain disadvantages. Toxic and or environmentally unsatisfactory chemicals are used which necessitate the use of special equipment.The used substances, alien to the body, such as tannins, polymers and amorphous silicic acid, are retained in the feed material.Feedstuffs, November 9 1981 , pp 24 26 and 38, is a review paper which describes processes for preparing protected protein by subjecting proteinaceous oil seed material to a heat treatment. The processes described had been carried out at various temperatures above 1009C, mostly between 130 and 1509C. For many of the processes the use of high pressure equipment such as an extruder or an autoclave is required. The success in preparing protected protein varied widely between the various processes.In particular, the paper reports an unsuccessful attempt to prepare protected protein by subjecting soybeans for 24 hours to a heat treatment at 105vac It has now been found that by conversion with dialdehyde starch and or acid, certain proteinaceous materials can be protected against premature degradation without the need to use toxic and or environmentally unsatisfactory compounds. Moreover, no undesirable contaminants are left behind in the feedstuff. The conversion can be carried out in conventional equipment at atmospheric pressure and the energy requirements of the process are relatively low.Accordingly, the invention provides a process for the preparation of protein protected from premature degradation in the rumen of ruminants, wherein a composition which includes 15 708 by weight of water and 85 308 by weight of dry proteinaceous oil seed material is subjected to a heat treatment at a temperature of at least 70 but below lOO9C in the presence of a substance selected from the group consisting of edible acids and dialdehyde starch and mixtures thereof.Dialdehyde starch is a commercially available compound which can be made from starch by oxidation with periodic acid. At an oxidation degree of 90 or more, it contains about 2 aldehyde groups per each glucose unit that is originally present, corresponding approximately to the following formula EMI3.1 It is a non toxic compound which is digested immediately and therefore it is not necessary to remove any non converted dialdehyde starch afterwards. Preferably, the amount of dialdehyde starch used is at least 0.18 by weight calculated on the amount of protein. To prevent unnecessarily large amounts of dialdehyde starch in the animal feedstuff, which large amounts might have undesirable effects, the amount of dialdehyde starch to be used should not be larger than 5 by weight calcu lated on the amount of protein.The dialdehyde starch is preferably added as an aqueous solution or suspension, if the solubility is exceeded .Oil seed proteins which can be protected by treatment with dialdehyde starch and or edible acid according to the invention are for example proteins contained in roughage and meals, as obtained after the extraction of oil from soybean, rapeseed, sunflower seed, groundnuts, cottonseed, coconut, linseed, sesame seed, poppy seed, etc., and in products obtained therefrom, such as roasted meals, de sugared and or defatted flour, protein concentrates and protein isolates. Preferably the oil seed protein is soya protein. It is particularly preferred to use de oiled oilseed flakes as the proteinaceous oil seed material in the composition to be treated with dialdehyde starch. Accordingly, the oil seed material to be treated may comprise from about 15 or 20 to 100 wt. oil seed protein.Preferably, the material to be treated comprises from 25 to 85 wt. , more preferably from 40 to 60 wt. of oil seed protein, calculated on the dry weight of the oil seed material. The water content of the composition should at least be 15 by weight. At lower water contents, no effective protection of the protein is obtained. Preferably, the water content is 20 50 , more preferably 20 30 by weight.The present process can be carried out with or without using dialdehyde starch. In both cases the heat treatment is preferably carried out in the presence of edible acid in an amount such that the composition has a pB of 2.8 6.5. By the pH of the composition is meant the pH of the aqueous phase of the composition. It is particularly preferred that the eat treatment is carried out in the presence of both edible acid and dialdehyde starch. Preferably the proteinaceous material to be treated is in the form of discrete particles, such as flakes. The water to be added to obtain the desired moisture content which may contain the dialdehyde starch, can be absorbed in the proteinaceous particles such that the conversion takes place as a heterogeneous reaction. The aqueous phase of the composition preferably has a pH of from 2.8 to 6, more preferably from 4 to 5. To achieve this pH value, for example hydrochloric acid or phosphoric acid can be used. At alkaline pH the solubility of the protein is reduced to a lesser extent than at acid pH. Moreover, the products converted at low pH have a better smell and a lighter colour than those converted at high pH. At pH below about 2.8 hydrolysis of the protein may occur.Preferably, the reactants are mixed together and subsequently heated to a temperature of at least 709C under constant agitation.The lower the water content of the reaction mixture, the more economic the process is. If desired, the water is removed afterwards by drying the reaction product under mild conditions preferably at 30 509C until a residual moisture content of 6 10 has been achieved. Thespr5eferred amount of dialdehydeF starch used is between 0.1 and 2 , more preferably between 0.5 and 1 , calculated on the weight of the protein to be protected. The dialdehyde starch is preferably added as an aqueous solution or suspension, which preferably contains about 108 dialdehyde starch. The aqueous medium in which the dialdehyde starch is to be dissolved or dispersed, preferably has a pH of about 8. A particularly suitable medium is an aqueous solution containing about 1 of sodium propanoate or ethanoate, of which sodium propanoate is preferred. A solution of 1 sodium propanoate has a pH of about 7.8. Dissolving 10 dialdehyde starch into this solution reduces the pH to about 5. Propionic acids and salts thereof may be used as feed material additives.The dialdehyde starch solution or suspension can be diluted before addition with the water needed for obtaining the desired moisture content.The reaction mixture obtained is preferably heated at a temperature of at least 70 but below 100us for 10 minutes to 16 hours. The optimal heating time depends on the heating temperature, the water content and the desired extent of protection. An advantage of the present process is that the risk of overprotection occurring is relatively small. On the other hand, to prevent unnecessarily high energy consumption, the heating time is preferably chosen as short as possible, to achieve the desired degree of protection at the chosen temperature. Generally, the heating time preferably is about 0.25 to 2 hours. At about 90 C, the heating is preferably applied for 0.25 to 1 hour, more preferably for 0.3 to 0.6 hours. At 809C, the heating time preferably is about 0.5 to 2 hours.The temperature at which the conversion is carried out is preferably 80 95 C. At substantially higher temperatures, the colour of the products may become very dark.The reaction is preferably carried out at a pH of 4 5.The pH can be adjusted with inorganic acids, such as phosphoric acid and hydrochloric acid or with organic acids, such as the low water soluble alkane acids, preferably propionic acid, succinic acid or tartaric acid. It is particularly preferred to use phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid does not cause corrosion of the equipment and the amounts required to obtain the desired pH are small.The products obtained can be used as components of feed for ruminants, such as cattle, sheep, goats and for ruminants kept in zoological gardens, such as cameis and giraffes.The product of the present process is particularly suitable for incorporation in the feedstuffs for ruminants. The product can, however, also suitably be used for feeding other animals. An advantage of the present process is that it can reduce antinutritional factors which may occur in oil seed material. For example, the process can reduce the trypsin inhibitor activity of proteinaceous soybean products, which is important when the product is to be used for feeding e.g. calves, by incorporating it in a calf milk replacer.Compositions for feeding animals preferably include 270 wt. , more preferably 5 50 wt. of the product of the present process, calculated as dry contents on the total dry weight of the composition. For compositions for feeding ruminants it is particularly preferred that the composition includes 5 20 wt. of the product of the present process, calculated on the dry contents.The invention is further illustrated by the followingExamples but is not restricted thereto. In all Examples in which dialdehyde starch is employed, a commercial grade of dialdehyde starch is used. The dialdehyde starch used is a white to sightly yellowish powder having an oxidation degree of 90 or more and contains at most 12 moisture and displays at most 1 sulphate ash.The solubility of the protein was determined as follows 20 g of the material to be analyzed was thoroughly mixed with 300 ml distilled water at a temperature of 50 559C. Insoluble substances were removed from the mixture obtained by centrifuging and the volume of the remaining solution was determined. In 15 ml of the mixture N was determined according to Kjeldahl and the protein content is calculated with the factor 6.25.The solubility of the protein indicates the percentage of the protein which is readily available and which consequently will almost certainly be digested in the rumen. At lower solubility of the protein the amount of protein which will not be prematurely digested will be higher.The N degradability of the protein was determined in situ as described by P.N. Wilson and P.J. Strachan inW. Haresign, Recent advances in Animal nutrition 1980 , Butterworths, London Boston, p. 99 118. TheN degradability after 6 hours is a measure for the part of the protein that will be digested in the rumen. The degradability after 6 hours will be higher than the volubility of the protein, because in the rumen not only the readily available protein is digested, but also part of the less readily available protein. For comparable protein sources, prepared in a comparable sway, there is a positive correlation between solubility data and N degradability data after 6 hours. The N degradability after 48 hours is an indication for the part of the protein which is digestible at all. Thus, for protected protein, the N degradability after 6 hours should be low and after 48 hours it should beSigh. An indication of the digestibility of the protein can also be determined by rat feeding tests. Example 1 go kg soybean meal containing about 11 water were introduced into a jacketed stirrer. The pH was adjusted to about 4,5 by adding a solution of phosphoric acid, prepared by dilution of 0.7 kg of an 85 phosphoric acid solution with 3.9 kg water. While stirring, which was continued during the whole procedure, a solution of 0.05 kg dialdehyde starch prepared by dilution of 0.5 1 of a 10 dialdehyde solution containing 1 sodium propanoate, with 3.9 kg water, was added.The amounts of water added wetted the soybean meal until a moisture content of about 50 had been obtained. The reaction mixture was heated to 809C within 50 min. and then kept at this temperature for 2 hours. The soybean meal thus treated was dried at 40 C for about 20 hours.

The amounts of water added wetted the soybean meal until a moisture content of about 30 had been achieved.

The mixture was then dried at 409c for 24 hours.

S moisture content of the composition was adjusted to 30 .In one case, the moisture content was adjusted to 23 instead of 308. The pH of each of the compositions was about 5.Subsequently, each composition was heated within 20 minutes to 909C and kept at that temperature for 30 minutes at atmospheric pressure. The products were then dried and analyzed. The compositions used in the experiments and the results of the analysis are shown inTable 1 and Table 2, respectively.

The feed absorption is about 21 kg per day corresponding to 12.3 kg dry matter. This composition was fed to 5 lactating cows for 1 month. The composition was well accepted and the cows had high milk production.Example 46A feeding test was carried out with rainbow trout, for which the diet composition is notoriously critical. Two groups of 40 rainbow trouts each were given a diet which contained either a product prepared according to Example 23 group A or the soybean meal starting material group B . The two diets had been matched, in particular regarding the overall protein, fat, fibre, ash and vitamin content. 50 of the protein was provided by a casein gelatin mixture, the other 50 by the soybean material. The amount of soya material in the diet was 49.3 wt. for group A and 46.7 wt. for group B. The average body weight at the beginning of the test was 44 g for both groups. At the end of the test, the average body weight for group A was 110 g and for group B 104 g, thus the increase in body weight for group A was 10 higher than it was for group B. Both diets were well accepted.However, when the bath temperature was reduced to 12 CC, group B refused the diet, whereas group A still accepted it.
