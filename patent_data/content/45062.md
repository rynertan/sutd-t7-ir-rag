# Apparatus and process for producing carbon black.

## Abstract
Apparatus and process for producing carbon black having a residual tint of less than about 5 by injecting a feedstock axially into a vortex flow of combustion gases created in a cylindrical precombustion zone 8 which is connected to a first frustoconical converging zone 10 , followed by a second frustoconical diverging zone 12 . Means for quenching the reactor effluent are provided downstream of zone 10 . Some typical dimen sions of the furnace are emphasized.
