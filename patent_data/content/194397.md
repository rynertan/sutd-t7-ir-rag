# Bearing with integrated sealing device for motor water pumps.

## Abstract
Two sets of balls 2,3 are used, kept by two cages 4, 5 in position at equal distance on a shaft 1 , engaged in a cylindrical tube 6 , to be integrally monted on the pump. The cylindrical tube 6 is hooled on the end of a gasket body 8 allowing to seal on the shaft 1 , on the pumpa 9 and on a counterface body 10 pressed on a ring 11 by a pushing spring 12 on a crown refief 16 on the shaft 1 . On the other end of the cylindrical tube 6 , a sealing element is fitted in an inner annular groove 19 , consisting of a plate 20 covered with vulcanized rubber 21 . In the gasket body 8 , a duct 17 is foreseen for during the liquid infiltrations.

## Claims
Clah 1 Bearing with integrated sealing device for motor water pumps, characterized by the fact that the operative assembly foresses a cylindrical coaxial body which can be fitted integral on the pump, for mounting the supporting shaft on the turning piece which rotates on two ball sets kept by two cages at equal distance. The said coaxial is hooked in an integrally operating way on the end of a gasket body for sealing on the shaft, on the pump and on a counterface body pressed, by means of a ring, by a thrusting spring on a crown shaped relief on the shaft. On the other cylindrica tube a sealing element is foreseen positioned in an inner annu lar groove and consisting of a plate covered with vulcanized rubber. In the gasket body, a duct is foreseen for the liquid infiltrations. 2 Bearing with integrated sealing device for motor water pumps, as to claim 1, characterized by the fact that employs two sets of balls 2 and 3 , on a shaft 1 properly fitted at the same distance by means of a pair of cages 4 and 5 in plastic material. The above shaft is turning by means of the said cinamatisms in a cylindrical tube 6 engrng ing the two ball sets in grooves foreseen for this purpose. Cylindrical coaxial 6 foresees a hooking profile 7 on one end binding by groove a gasket body 8 , the task of which is to ensure sealing on shaft, on the pump body 9 as well as on counterface body 10 . Said counterface body is kept pressed on a ring 11 as a consequence of the thrust made by a helica spring 12 the position of which is fixed in advance by a ring 13 its position is depending on a grove 14 on the shaft. Arnular gasket .11 has an aditional seal on shaft by means of an anular piece 15 with crown relief 16 . On gasket body a duct 17 is foreseen permitting the drain of liquid infiltrations, if any, through a bore 18 in correspondence of pump body. On the other end of cylindrical tube 6 a sealing element is foreseen engaged and consisting of plate 20 covered with vulcanized rubber 21 acting as a seal on shaft 1 .

## Description
Bearing with integrated sealing device for motor water pumps.The invention refers to a bearing with integrated sealing device, to be emplo ed in the water pumps for motors. Such pumps are in general to be used with motors cooled by liquid circulation, and particularly with those for motor cars, trucks, lorries, excavators and tractors. For the movement of the turning pie ce determnating the liquid circulation, these pumps employ a bearing with two ball crowns or with one ball crown and one roller crown and one sealing device. This compartment is at present mounted by fitting a gasket on The shaft positioned on the relevant counterface.The turning piece is fitted, which contemporarily acts as a lock and a seal, by means of a contact surface properly ground The invention permits to avoid the above mounting sequences by adopting an operative assembly including both the ball bearing and the gasket and in this way is to be directly mounted in the pump body. Therefore, the proceeding enables to reduce the mounting times, a better compacting of the pump components and a more efficient seal.The operative assembly foresees a cylindriccal coaxial body which can be fitted integral on the pump, for mounting the supporting shaft of the turning piece which rotates on two ball sets kept by two cages at equal distance. The said coaxial is hooked in an integrally operating way on the end of a gasket body for sealing on the shaft, on the pump and on a counterface body pressed, by means of a ring, by a thrusting spring on a crown shaped relief of the sfaft.On the other coaxial end, a preclusion sieve is foreseen positioned in an in ner annular groove and consisting of a thin plate covered with volcanized rub ber. In the gasket body, a draining duct is foreseen for eliminating the liquid in filtrations.A not limiting execution form is illustrated by the drawings of Table 1, of ich fig. 1 is the longitudinal section of the operating assembly fitted on the pump. Fig. 2 is the magnified longitudinal section of one half of the assembly illustrated in the preceding figure. The version employs two sets of balls 2 and 3 on shaft I properly fitted at the same distance by means of a pair of cages 4 and 5 in plastic material. The above shaft is turning by means of the said cinematisms in the cylindrical coaxial 6 engaging the two ball sets 2 and 3 in grooves foreseen for this purpose.Cylindrical coaxial 6 foresees a hooking profile 7 on one end binding by groove a seal body 8., the task fo which is to ensure sealing on shaft 1, on the pump body 9 as well as on counterface body 10 In particular, the counterface body 10 is kept pressed by ring 11 as a consequence of the thrust made by helical spring 12, the position of which is fixed in advance by ring 13 its position is depending on groove 14 on shaft 1. Annular gasket 11 has an additional seal on shaft I by means of annular piece 15 with crown shaped relief 16. On body 8, a duct 17 is foreseen permitting the drain of liquid infil trations, if any, through bore 18 in correspondence on body 19. On the other end of ring 6, a sealing element is foreseen engaged in 19 and consisting of plate 20 covered with vulcanized rubber 21 acting as a seal on shaft 1.The operative assembly can be fitted differently carried out bu changing the form of the components and the relevant materials that are employd.
