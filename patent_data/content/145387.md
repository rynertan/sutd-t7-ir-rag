# A DEVICE FOR THE PURIFICATION OF GASES

## Abstract
The invention relates to a device which is intended for centrifugal separation on the basis of the specific gravity or by using a medium which increases the specific gravity. The device is in particular suitable for the purification of gases. The device is made up of a cyclone A , a pre scrubbing section B and a centrifuge section C . The operation of the device is based on rotational motion in the same direction, the separation being carried out by changing the angular velocities of the rotational motion. After moistening 6 of the particles in the cyclone A the angular velocity is reduced in the pre scrubbing section B in order to separate the heavy particles, whereafter the angular velocity of the gas being purified, when raised into the centrifuge section C , re increases, and at the same time an additional moistening 13 is carried out, an effective mixing of the liquid and the gas taking place. By means of blowers 21, 22 which resem ble a centrifugal pump and a rising spiral 24 in the centri fuge section the material is raised into the centrifuge section C , where the slurry is separated and passes through slits 17 in the mantle back into the prescrubbing section B , or is directed out into a separate pipe system.
