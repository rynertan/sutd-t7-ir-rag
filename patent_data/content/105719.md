# A LIQUID DISPENSER

## Abstract
A dispenser for dispensing liquid such as nail varnish has a flexible bottle 10 and a cap 16 which supports a tube 30 leading to a brush 32. The cap may be reversed from an operative position in which the brush protrudes from the bottle to a storage position with the brush in the bottle. A closure cap may be mounted on the exposed part of the main cap to seal the end of the tube 30. The brush is prevented from drying out in the storage condition.
