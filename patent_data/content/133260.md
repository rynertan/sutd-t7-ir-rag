# Rubber compositions and articles thereof having improved metal adhesion and metal adhesion retention.

## Abstract
Rubber compositions and metal reinforced rubber ply members have improved metal adhesion and metal adhesion retention to brass and brass plated metallic reinforcement. The improvement comprises admixing from about 0.5 to about 12.5 parts per hundred rubber phr of an organic salt of nickel and at least about 3.0 phr of a thermoplastic resin derived from crude wood rosin containing carboxylic acid groups or carbox ylic acid ester groups with a vulcanizable rubber composition prior to embedding the metallic reinforcement therein and cur ing. A method for improving the metal adhesion and metal adhesion retention between a vulcanizable rubber and brass or brass plated metallic reinforcement includes the steps of dispersing from about 0.5 to about 12.5 phr of an organic salt of nickel in a vulcanizable rubber composition and dispersing at least about 3.0 phr of the aforementioned thermoplastic resin in the same rubber composition prior to curing.
