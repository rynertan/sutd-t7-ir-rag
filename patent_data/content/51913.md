# Remote control surveying.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for remote control survey ing which eliminates the need for a rod man or other assistant while performing surveying operations with an electronic distance measuring device. The method in cludes positioning reflectors 11 over the end points of a base line of known length, positioning an electronic distance measuring device 17 over a desired survey station S , rotating the reflectors 11 into alignment with the electronic measuring device 17 by remote control, and measuring the distance from the survey station S to the two reflectors 11 . The method also includes traverse operations using a single reflectors positioned over a base point. The location of the survey station S can then be calculated and the electronic distance measuring device 17 may be relocated to sub sequent survey stations and the reflectors 11 realigned by remote control. The apparatus includes an attachment 10 for a standard surveying tribrach which rotatably supports a standard reflector unit 11 and an electric motor M in a vertical position. An operator selectively activates switches on a portable radio transmitter 18 . The signal is received by a control box 15 which ener gizes the motor M to rotate the reflector unit 11 in the desired direction. A stroboscopic light may be attached to the top of the reflector unit 11 to rotate in conjunction with the reflector unit and aid in its align ment.
