## Description
The present invention relates generally to a decoder for spectrum diffusion signals. which is specially adapted for satellite communications utilizing spectrum diffusion signals. Spectrum diffusion communications systems hereafter called as SS communications systems are know to be advantageous in that they can use pseudo random noise signals hereafter referred to as PRN signal which allow sufficiently precise frequency channel selection and thus satisfactorily avoid interference among communication channels. Therefore, information security can be guaranteed by use of such SS communications systems. In addition. such SS communications systems have the advantage that PRN signals have a relative high band width for modulating data signals. In such SS communications systems, received satellite signals must be demodulated in the receiving station. In order to demodulate the satellite signal, processing by back diffusion has to be performed utilizing a Gold code specific to the station to keep the specific communications channel secure. For such back diffusion process, it has been conventionally believed that the phase of the Gold code must be synchronized with the phase of the received PRN signal by the decoder itself when checking the codes for a match. This synchronization will be referred to hereafter as PN synchronization . Therefore, conventional decoders for spectrum diffusion signals have required means for performing PN synchronization, such as sliding correlating loops or matched filters or the like. Such means for performing PN synchronization prevents simplification of the decoder circuitry. In order to accomplish the aforementioned object, a decoder for spectrum diffusion signals, according to the present invention, can reproduce data from received SS signals without performing PN synchronization. The decoder comprises a correlation detecting means comprising a matched filter which produces a back diffusion signal when a received spectrum diffusion signal correlates with a Gold code for a specific channel of a station, an extraction signal generator means for detecting the epoch position of a peak of a triangular wave which appears in the output of the correlation detecting means when correlation between the spectrum diffusion signal and the specific Gold code identifying the corresponding channel is established, and a data output extracting means responsive to the extraction signal to extract the back diffusion signal and reproduce the resulting data. In the arrangement set forth above, the extraction signal generator means is responsive to the peak of the triangular form wave in the back diffusion signal from the correlation detecting means to output the extraction signal. The extraction signal is sent to the data output extraction means to extract back diffusion signal from the output of the correlation detecting means and reproduce the data output. Therefore, according to the invention, it is unnecessary to peform PN synchronization in order to obtain data from the spectrum diffusion signal. According to one aspect of the invention, a decoder for spectrum diffusion signals comprises a correlation means for comparing a PRN signal included in the spectrum diffusion signal with a Gold code identifying a specific channel, the correlation means producing a back diffusion signal when the PRN signal matches the Gold code, an extraction signal generator means, responsive to the back diffusion signal, for producing an extraction signal at a timing near which the back diffusion signal value reachs a peak, and an extraction means, responsive to the extraction signal, for extracting a data signal from the back diffusion signal. The correlation means produces a triangular wave each time the PRN code matches the Gold code. The decoder further comprises means for forming a frequency component enveloped by the triangular signal. The frequency component enveloped by the triangular signal has a frequency twice as high as a carrier wave in the spectrum diffusion signal. The frequency component forming means comprises a voltage controlled oscillator and a multiplier, which voltage controlled oscillator produces a local oscillation signal having a frequency substantially corresponding to that of the carrier wave, and which multiplier receives the spectrum diffusion signal and multiplies the spectrum diffusion signal by the local oscillation signal to form the envelope. The decoder further comprises an oscillation controlling means associated with the voltage controlled oscillator for controlling the latter so as to adjust the phase of the local oscillation signal to match the phase of the carrier wave of the spectrum diffusion signal. The oscillation control means comprises a multiplier receiving the spectrum diffusion signal and a local oscillation signal, the phase of which is shifted by a phase shifter to a given offset from the phase of the local oscillation signal output by the voltage controlled oscillator, a second correlation means for producing a back diffusion signal including a triangular wave produced when the PRN signal matches the Gold code, a filter for removing high frequency components from the back diffusion signal of the second correlation means and outputting an envelope signal, and a holding circuit receiving the envelope signal and holding the signal level thereof in response to the extraction signal, and a multiplier multiplying the reproduced data signal and the output of the holding circuit so as to derive an oscillation control signal for controlling the signal phase of the local oscillation signal of the voltage controlled oscillator. The extraction signal generator comprises a multiplier adder which derives the squares of each of the back diffusion signals of the correlation means and the second correlation means, and then adds the squares to produce a sum indicative signal, and a level detector responsive to the sum indicative value exceeding a given value to feed the extraction signal to the extraction circuit. In the alternative, the frequency component forming means comprises a delay circuit and a multiplier, the delay circuit transmitting the back diffusion signal after a given delay time, and the multiplier multiplying the back diffusion signal transmitted directly by the correlation means with the delayed back diffusion signal from the delay circuit to generate the frequency components enveloped by the triangular wave and having a frequency twice as high as the carrier wave of the spectrum diffusion signal. The extraction signal generator means comprises an envelope detector producing an envelope indicative signal, and a level detector for monitoring the level of the envelope indicative signal and outputting the extraction signal when the signal level of the envelope indicative signal exceeds a given level. The correlation means outputs more than one triangular wave signals during a period corresponding to one cycle of the Gold code. According to another aspect of the invention, a decoder for spectrum diffusion signals comprises a correlation means, receiving the spectrum diffusion signal, for comparing a PRN signal contained in the spectrum diffusion signal with a given Gold code which identifies a communication channel, and producing a back diffusion signal including a data component representative of the data indicative phase shift of the spectrum diffusion signal, an extraction signal generator associated with the correlation means for detecting peak values of the data component and producing an extraction signal at a timing near the peak value of the data component, and an extraction circuit, receiving the back diffusion signal and responsive to the extraction signal to extract the data component from the back diffusion signal. According to a further aspect of the invention, a process for reproducing data signal from a spectrum deffusion signal comprising the steps of The data component is in the form of a triangular wave each time the PRN code matches the Gold code. The process further comprises a step of forming a frequncy component enveloped by the triangular signal. The frequency component enveloped by the triangular signal has a frequency twice as high as a carrier wave in the spectrum diffusion signal. The process further comprises a step of controlling phase of a local oscillation signal utilized for forming the frequency component so as to adjust the phase of the local oscillation signal to match the phase of the carrier wave of the spectrum diffusion signal. In the alternative, the frequency component is formed by transmitting the back diffusion signal after a given delay time, and multiplying the back diffusion signal transmitted directly with the delayed back diffusion signal to generate the frequency components enveloped by the triangular wave and having a frequency twice as high as the carrier wave of the spectrum diffusion signal.
