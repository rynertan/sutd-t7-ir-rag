# Inductive heating arrangement for evaporating a thin alloy film onto a substrate, and method therefor.

## Abstract
The invention is a thin film alloy source utilizing a supply of alloy wire selected for deposition onto a substrate. The wire is advanced through an induction heating means at a controlled rate for evaporation onto the substrate. Detection of the meniscus height or temperature of the end of the wire being evaporated yields a control signal for operating the control wire feed mechanism for advancing the wire at a rate to provide a predetermined coating thickness.
