# Method and apparatus for loading a creel and linking more than one fibre processing machines.

## Abstract
A method of loading a creel 7 with sliver reservoirs 9 and automatically linking one or more fibre processing machine comprising at least the steps of providing a reservoir loading station 10 remote from the creel 7 , moving a loaded sliver reservoir 9 along a pathway 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 31 40, 43, 44 towards and away from the creel 7 capturing the free end 61 of the sliver of the loaded reservoir 9 , and feeling said free end 61 of the sliver to the creel required, and an apparatus suitable for use in said method including a loading station 10 in the nature of a fibre processing machine adapted to load a sliver reservoir 9 with a length of sliver, a pathway 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 31 40, 43, 44 leading from said station 10 to a creel 7 , means 22, 28, 30 41 for moving a loaded reservoir 9 to and from the loading station 10 to the creel 7 and means 62 63 90 for capturing the free end 61 of the sliver for the purpose of feeding it to the creel 7 .
