# Integrated semiconductor memory.

## Abstract
A memory array is provided which includes a common sense line 22 to which is connected a first storage capac itor 12 through first switching means 14 and a second storage capacitor 18 through second switching means 20 , with a common word line 24 connected to the control electrodes of the first and second switching means 14, 20 , a first bit line 26 connected to a plate of the first storage capacitor and a second bit line 28 connected to a plate of the second storage capacitor. Data is stored into or read from the first storage capacitor 12 by selecting the com mon word line and the first bit line and data is stored into and read from the second storage capacitor 18 by select ing the common word line and the second bit line, with the data from both storage capacitors being detected on the common sense line 22 .
