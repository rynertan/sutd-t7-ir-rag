## Description
ROTARY VANE PUMPBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a variable volume type rotary vane pump which can be used as an oil pump for an automatic transmission or a compressor for an air conditioner. In general, such a type rotary vane pump has a cam ring, a rotor eccentrically arranged in the cam ring, and a plurality of vanes which are attached to the rotor so as to move in the radius directions. The vanes always contact the inner periphery of the cam ring. When the rotor rotates relative to the cam ring, plural pump chambers formed between the adjacent vanes change in volume so as to function as a pump. By adjusting the eccentricity between the cam ring and the rotor, the volume change rate varies so that the discharging amount or quantity of the fluid from the pump chambers changes. In most conventional variable volume type rotary vane pumps, however, an actuator is separate from the vane pump for the purpose of adjusting the eccentricity in response to the volume control pressure. For example, seeJapanese Patent Publication No. 53 6724. In other words, such an actuator must be added. For such a reason, the total size of the pump and the actuator becomes large.Therefore, a large space is required so as. to arrange the pump and the actuator. Also the number of parts and the production cost increase. It is proposed in Japanese Laying OpenNo. 55 17696 that a cam ring itself constitutes a rotary piston. By rotating the cam ring in response to the volume control pressure, the eccentricity between the cam ring and the rotor is adjusted. In this rotary vane pump, however, because the volume control pressure is directly applied to the cam ring, the thickness of the cam ring must be increased in order to obtain a reasonable resistance to the volume control pressure. As a result, the size of the pump increases.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of this invention is to provide a variable volume type rotary vane pump which can be arranged in a compact size. According to this invention, a cam ring itself does not constitute a piston. A piston is arranged in a pump housing so as to move in response to the volume control pressure. This piston is used to displace the cam ring with respect to the pump housing thereby to adjust the eccentricity between a rotor and the cam ring. As the volume control pressure is not directly applied to the cam ring, it is not necessary to increase the thickness of the cam ring. Only a portion of the pump housing in which the piston is arranged must be increased in space. Therefore, a large space is not required in order to set the pump. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a front view, partly in section, of a variable volume type rotary vane pump according to this invention, and Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along the lineY Y of Fig. 1.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT lOF THE INVENTION A pump housing 1 has a through hole la formed between opposite ends lb thereof. Two pump covers 2 of a disc shape cover both ends lb of the pump housing 1, respectively, thereby to enclose the through hole la.These pump covers 2 are fixed to the ends lb of the pump housing 1 by means of bolt and nut means 3 so as to form a space 4 therein. In Fig. 1, one cover 2 is partly broken away for the purpose of showing many members arranged in the space 4. For instance, a cam ring 5 is arranged in the space 4. The cam ring 5 is rotatable around a pivot pin 6 at an outwardly projecting portion 5d. The pivot pin 6 is supported between the two pump covers 2. The width of the cam ring 5 is the same as that of the pump housing 1 such that both ends of the cam ring 5 can contact fluid tightly the inner surface of the pump covers 2. Further arranged in the cam ring 5 is a rotor 7 which is fixed coaxially to a pump driving shaft 8. The shaft 8 is rotatably supported by the pump covers 2. One end of the shaft 8 extends outwardly from the pump cover 2 so as to be connected to a driving source not shown . The rotor 7 rotates together with the shaft 8 in the direction of the arrow X in Fig. 1. The width of the rotor 7 is the same as that of the pump housing 1 so that both end portions of the rotor 7 can contact fluid tightly the pump covers 2. A plurality of vanes 9 are slidably inserted into slit formed at the same intervals in a peripheral portion of the rotor 7. Each slit is connected to a through hole 7b formed between opposite circular grooves 7a. The circular grooves 7a of a channel shape are formed in the opposite end surfaces of the rotor 7. A spring ring 10 is arranged in each of the circular grooves 7a. All vanes 9 are outwardly biased by the ring 10 thereby to press the outer end portions of the vanes 9 against the inner surface Sc of the cam ring 5. The width of each vane 9 is the same as that of the pump housing 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The ends of the vanes 9 contact fluid tightly the inner surfaces of the pump covers 2. A plurality of pump chambers 11 are defined by the adjacent vanes 9, the cam ring 5, the rotor 7 and the two pump covers 2. In the shown embodiment of this invention, nine vanes are used to form nine pump chambers 11. In addition, a piston 12 is arranged in the space 4 of the pump housing 1. The piston 12 is placed along a side portion of the cam ring 5. A pressure chamber 14 is defined by the pump housing 1, the piston 12, and the two pump covers 2. The piston 12 is rotatable around a pivot pin 15 attached between the two pump covers 2 at one end of the piston 12. The other end of the piston 12 abuts against a projection 5a of the cam ring 5. A piston ring 13 is attached to the piston 12 near the projection 5a of the cam ring 5 so as to ensure the pressure chamber 14b remaining in a good condition. The cam ring 5 has also an arm 5b extending outwardly near the projection 5a. A return spring 16 is arranged between the arm 5b and a recess wall lc of the pump housing 1 thereby to bias the cam ring 5 counterclockwise. When the cam ring 5 is positioned as shown inFig. 1, the center 01 of the cam ring 5 is apart from the center 02 of the rotor 7. That is, the cam ring 5 and the rotor 7 are not coaxial. One of the pump cover 2 has a pump entrance port 2a, a pump exit port 2b and a volume control pressure port 2c. As shown particularly in Fig. 1, the pump entrance port 2a and the pump exit port 2b are formed of an arm shape and positioned substantially along the outer periphery of the rotor 7 at the opposition to each other. The pump entrance port 2a is relatively near the return spring 16.The pump exit port 2b is near the pivot pin 6. The volume control pressure port 2c faces the pressure chamber 14. The operation of the rotary vane pump will be explained. Fig. 1 shows a normal condition of the rotary vane pump. In this condition, when the rotor 7 rotates in the direction of the arrow X, the volume of each pump chamber 11 varies due to the eccentricity between the cam ring 5 and the rotor 7. When the vanes 9 move along the pump entrance port 2a, the volume of the pump chambers 11 increase whereby the fluid flows into the pump chambers 11 from the pump entrance port 2a. On the other hand, when the vanes 9 move along the pump exit port 2b, the volume of the pump chambers 11 decrease so that the fluid is discharged through the pump exit port 2b. Such a cycle is repeated whereby the fluid is continuously intaken and then discharged so as to obtain a desired pump operation. In a normal condition as shown in Fig. 1, the eccentricity between the cam ring 5 and the rotor 7 is the largest. In other words, the center 01 of the cam ring 5 is apart from the center 02 of the rotor 7 to the most extreme degree. In such a condition, the volume change rate of the pump chambers 11 is the high so that the pump feeding capacity is the largest. If the pump feeding capacity becomes in excess, an excess of volume control pressure is applied into the pressure chamber 14 through the volume control pressure port 2c whereby the piston 12 rotates clockwise around the pivot pin 15 against the biasing force of the return spring 16. As a result, the projection Sa of the cam ring 5 is displaced clockwise thereby to rotate the cam ring 5 in the same direction around the pivot pin 6. Thus, the center 01 of the cam ring 5 comes toward the center 02 of the rotor 7. The eccentricity between the rotor 7 and the cam ring 5 decreases. The volume change rate of the pump chambers 11 also decreases. Finally, the pump feeding capacity is controlled at a desired small value. If the pump feeding capacity is short or too small, the volume control pressure in the pressure chamber 14 becomes small in response thereto. The piston 12 and the cam ring 5 rotate counterclockwise or in the direction of the arrow X by means of the biasing force of the return spring 16. As a result, the center 01 of the cam ring 5 becomes apart from the center 02 of the rotor 7 so that the eccentricity therebetween increases. Thus, the pump feeding capacity is adjusted to a desired value. As can be seen from the foregoing, according to this invention, a variable volume type rotary vane pump has the piston 12 operating in response to the volume control pressure. The piston 12 is used to move the cam ring 5 relative tze rotor 7 so as to change the eccentricity between he cam ring 5 and the rotor 7 for the purpose of adjusting the pump feeding capacity. Therefore, the volume control pressure is not directly applied to the cam ring 5. For such a reason, it is not necessary to increase the thickness of the cam ring 5. Accordingly, a compact pump can be designed except the place where the piston 12 is arranged.
