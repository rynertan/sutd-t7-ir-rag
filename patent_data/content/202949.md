# Locking devices and keys for use therewith.

## Abstract
A locking device of the cylinder type has an additional tumbler 21 movable in a bore 22 extending in a direction parallel to the longitudinal central plane of the keyway 10 and opening into a side wall 10 of the keyway. The tumbler 21 has an enlarged head 24 in which a run up slope 26 is provided extending lengthwise of the keyway 10 . A key 12 has a control element pin 18 captive in a transverse bore 15 in the blade 11 , said pin being caused to project, by engagement of one end with an abutment in the opposite side wall 10 of the keyway 10 , with its opposite end beyond the wide side of the key, thus to operate the additional tumbler 21 . The diameter of the pin 18 is substantially less than the lengthwise dimension of the run up slope 26 .
