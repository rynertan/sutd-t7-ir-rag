# Device for addressing a memory.

## Abstract
An address word N for addressing a memory 2 comprises an exponent field P that defines on one hand the length of a memory field whereto access is obtained, on the other a number by which a second field M in the address word is modified, the memory being addressed by the modifying second field. A memory control unit 5 comprises an address shift register 26 for storing the second field M of the address word and an exponent register 26 for storing the exponent field P . The exponent register controls on one hand the shifting of the address shift register contents, on the other the successive updating of the address being read from the address shift register into a memory address register 61 .
