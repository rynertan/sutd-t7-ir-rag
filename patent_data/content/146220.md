## Abstract
A vaporiser includes means 11 which may be an elec tronically controlled solenoid valve to divert repeatedly a carrier gas into either a first path which goes directly from the inlet 3 to the outlet 5 of the vaporiser or a second path which enters a vaporising chamber 13 to entrain volatile liq uid vapour before re joining the first path.
