## Description
NOVEL DIARALKYLDICHLOROSILANES, PROCESS FOR THEIRPRODUCTION AND THEIR USE IN MANUFACTURE OF POLYSILOXANES The present invention relates to novel organosilicon compounds, and in particular to diaralkyldichlorosilanes. Of the organosilicon compounds, diorganodichiorosilanes are very important corn pounds for use as bifuhctional monomers in manufacturing polysiloxanes. Dialkyldichloros ilanes and diphenyldichlorosilanes have heretofore been generally known, but diaralkyldichlorosilanes have never been reported. Dichlorosilanes having an aralkyl group are found in US Patent No. 2. 618. 646 and elsewhere, but are limited to those having one aralkyl group. In recent years, along with the development of the silicone resin industry, a need for novel organosilicon compounds with modified properties has arisen. The present inventors have prepared dichlorosilanes having two aralkyl groups for the first time. The compounds of the present invention are diaralkyldichlorosilanes expressed by the general formulaEMI2.1 R1 and Rê are the same or different and each represent hydrogen orC1 to C4 alkyl, p and q are the same or different and each represents 0, 1, 2 or 3, when p or q is 1 then R or R4 is C1 to C4 alkyl and when p or q is 2 or 3 then each R3 or R is the same or different and is C1 to C4 alkyl. The compound wherein R1 and R2 are hydrogen and p and q are 0 is excluded, and the present compounds are thus alkyl substituted diphenethyldichloros ilanes. Of the coin pounds expressed by the general formula I , the preferred ones are those wherein p and q are both 0, ie di ss phenylalkyldichlorosilanes wherein the alkyls may be the same or different but not both ethyl those wherein p and q are both 1, ie di P tolyalkyldichlorosilanes, and those wherein one of p and q is 0 and the other is 1, ie phenylalkyl. 3 tolylalkyldichlorosilanes. Concrete examples of the compounds of the present invention include di ss phenylpropyldichlorosilane di ss phenylbutyldichlorosilane di ss phenylpentyldichlorosilane di 3 phenylhexyldichlorosilane di ss tolylethyldichlorosilane di ss tolylpropyldichlorosilane di ss tolylbutyldichlorosilane di 3 t ol ylhe xyld ichlor os ilane ss tolylethy.ss tolylpropyldichlorosilane p tolylethyl.ss tolylbutyldichlorosilane ss tolylpropyl.ss tolylbutyldichlorosilane ss phenylethyl.ss tolylethyldichlorosilane, and p phenylethyl.ss tolylpropyldichlorosilane. The corn pounds of the present invention are not restricted to those wherein p and q are selected from 0 and 1. For example the possible aralkyl substituents of compounds of the invention further include xylyl, eg 2, 3 xylyl, where there are two methyl groups on the phenyl ring, and mesityl where there are three methyl groups on the phenyl ring. 3 4 Moreover, R and R need not be confined to methyl groups.For instance, the possible aralkyl substituents further include cumyl. The present invention provides a process for producing the compounds of the general formula I . The process is carried out as shown in the following equations A and B Equation A EMI4.1 Equation B EMI4.2 wherein RÚ, Rê, q ,R and R4 are as defined above . Firstly, dichlorosilane II is subjected to an addition reaction with a styrene compound III which is styrene itself or a styrene derivative, at a temperature of 30 to 200 C in the presence of a catalyst which is a complex of a transition metal of group VIII of the Periodic Table and a phosphine compound, to form a monoaralkyldichlorosilane IV , as shown in the above equation A . Next, this monoaralkyldichlorosilane IV is subjected to an addition reaction with a styrene compound V which is styrene itself or a styrene derivative, at a temperature of 10 to 200 C in the presence of a catalyst which is a complex of a transition metal of group VIII of the Periodic Table and a phosphine compound or in the presence of chloroplatinic acid except that where R2 is hydrogen, chloroplatinic acid is not employed to form a diaralkyldichlorosilane I , as shown in the equation B Concrete examples of the styrene derivatives include a methylstyrene, m ethylstyrene, a a ethylstyrene, a a propylstyrene, a butylstyrene, methylstyrenes vinyltoluenes , a methyl methylstyrenes, a ethyl methylstyrenes, a propyl methylstyrenes, a butylmethylstyrenes, etc. For methylstyrene and the methylstyrene derivatives, the ortho meta or para compounds or mixtures thereof can be used. The complex of a transition metal of group VIII of thePeriodic Table and a phosphine compound is preferably a complex represented by the general formula of MXn PR 3 m wherein RO is phenyl hereinafter abbreviated to Ph , aryl, alkyl or aralkyl M is a metal selected from ruthenium, rhodium, nickel and platinum X is a covalently bound halogen or hydrogen atom, a covalently bound substituted silyl group, or a non covalently bound carbon monoxide molecule or aromatic hydrocarbon compound n is an integer of 0 to 4 and m is an integer of 2 to 4, provided that The transition metal phosphine compound complex can be, for instance, RhH P Ph3 4, RhH CO PPh3 3ZRhCt CO PPh3 3, RhC PPh 3 3, RuC2 PPh3 3, RUHCl PPh3 3 C6H6 , RuHCl PPh3 3 33 C6H5CH3 , RuH3 PPh3 3 PPh3 3 Si OCH3 3 , RuH3 PPh3 3 Si OCH3 2Ph , RuH PPh3 3 Si C2H5 2Cl ,RuH2 PPh3 4, NiCl2 PPh3 2 or Pt PPh3 4. Particularly when the styrene derivatives has no substituent at the a position, the use of Pt PPh3 4 is preferable. The diaralkyldichlorosilanes of the present invention are novel compounds and useful as monomers for polysiloxanes for use in improving the properties of silicone oils and varnishes employed for electrical insulating materials, lubricating oils, water repellants, paints and lacquers, release agents, etc. Further it is possible to utilize them as intermediates for synthesizing novel organosilicon compounds. Diaralkyldichlorosilanes of the present invention, when heated with water, form silanols and or cyclic siloxanes, which, in turn, when heated in the presence of an acid or a base as a catalyst, are polycondensed to form polymers. Further, it is also possible to hydrolyze at least one diaralkyldichlorosilane of the present invention together with at least one other organodichlorosilanc and then copolycondense the resulting silanols and or cyclic siloxanes.
