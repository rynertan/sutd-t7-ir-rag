# Device for testing semiconductor devices at a high temperature.

## Abstract
A device for testing semiconductor devices 5 at high temperatures comprises a heating portion where the semi conductor device 5 to be tested is heated to a predeter mined temperature a testing station a chuck 6 for holding the semiconductor device 5 and means for moving the chuck 6 to convey the semiconductor device 5 held by the chuck 6 to the testing station. The chuck 6 includes a heating means 2 for heating the semiconductor device 5 and a temperature sensor 3 . The device also includes temperature control means for controlling the temperature of the heating means 2 in response to the output of the temperature sensor 3 .
