# Control apparatus for a grinding machine.

## Abstract
In a grinding machine having a workpiece drive device for rotating a workpiece about an axis and an infeed device for effecting relative infeed movement between a rotating grinding wheel and the workpiece, a computerized numeri cal controller is provided with a data input device for input ting a numerical control program for the workpiece and data indicative of the shape of the workpiece for storage in a memory device. A data processor of the controller cal culates the rigidity of the workpiece based upon the shape data being stored in the memory device. Further, the data processor modifies by calculation rotational speed data and infeed rate data given in the numerical control program, based upon the calculated rigidity of the workpiece. The modified rotational speed data and the modified infeed rate data are respectively ouput to the workpiece drive device and the infeed device, so that the grinding condition of the workpiece is modified in accordance with the calculated rigidity of the workpiece.
