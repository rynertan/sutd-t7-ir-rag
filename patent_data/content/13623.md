# Pipe coupling.

## Abstract
A dry break coupling for pipes used in the delivery of hazardous fluids comprises a spigot member 10 and a complementary socket member 11 for attachment to the respective ends of the two pipes to be coupled. The spigot member carries a first poppet valve 19 which is spring loaded towards the mouth 14 of the spigot member to close said mouth, and the socket member carries a second poppet valve 28 . Fastening means 45, 46, 50 are arranged to urge the mouth of the spigot member into and secure said mouth in sealing engagement with an outer valve seat 26 of the socket member, and operating means 42,35 are provided to urge the second poppet valve 28 into sealing engagement with the inner valve seat 27 of the socket member and alternatively to move the second popper valve forwardly to engage and move the first poppet valve 19 out of engagement with the mouth and so open the valves. First interlocking means 54,56 permit actuation of the fastening means only when the spigot member is substantially fully inserted into the socket member, and second interlocking means 41,44 permit actuation of the operating means only when the spigot and socket members are secured together in sealing engagement by the fastening means. Suitably, sealing rings 23,26,27 of flat form are provided.
