# Method of reducing radioactivity in nuclear plant.

## Abstract
The present invention is concerned with a method of reducing radioactivity in a nuclear plant by preliminarily forming oxide films 15, 16 on the surfaces of metallic structural members 17 to be in contact with high temperature and high pressure reactor water containing radioactive substances before said metallic members 17 are exposed to said reactor water. The method is characte rized by the steps of subjecting said structural members 17 to a first step oxidation treatment of heating said structural members 17 in an environment of a high temperature, and further subjecting the thus treated structural members 17 to a second step oxidation treatment of heating said treated structural members 17 in an environment having a higher oxidizing capacity than that of said environment in said first step oxidation treatment to form a denser oxide film 15, 16 than an oxide film 15 obtained in said first step oxidation treatment.
