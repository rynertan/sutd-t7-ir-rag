# An ultrasonic probe for diagnostic examination of the interior of body cavities.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic probe for diagnostic examination of body cavity interiors has a chamber 41 containing transmitting medium 46 put in to fill the space of an ultrasonic wave oscillator transducer or the like, coated with and having a jacket cover 32 on its tip, has the chamber filled to be with an ultrasonic wave transmitting medium 46 to improve the introduction of ultrasonic waves into a body cavity, and a sealable pathway to the exterior is provided so that bubbles in said transmitting medium 46 can be easily removed, and medium replenished or replaced. If bubbles are contained in the transmitting medium 46 , or if the characteristics of the medium deteriorate, the quality of the ultrasonic diagnosis image will be reduced. By providing a communicating path 65 between the housing chamber 41 and the exterior, sealed with a closure member 66 which can be opened and closed as necessary, bubble removal and or replenishment or replacement of the medium is facilitated.
