## Description
NEWSPAPER STREAM CONVEYOR Background of the Invention It is well known that newspaper signatures are commonly taken from a press at a high rate of speed and transported appreciable distances in the form of an imbricated stream. Transport is usually effected by means a plurality of opposed coiled endless wire conveyor ribbons or opposed pairs of strips that are located at spaced positions across the width of the signatures. As mentioned earlier, signatures are usually moved considerable distances from the press, usually for counting, stacking and bundling in order that they can be shipped out. In the past it has been found that imbricated signatures must be moved vertically and also change directions in order to put them at the proper location and in the proper orientation for reception by a stayer, for example. While such wire conveyors have been effective, particularly on straight horizontal and vertical runs, they present problems in construction and operation when signatures must be ph Jsically revriented for subsequent operations. However, the wire conveyors mark the product due to the localized pressure of the wires. Summary of the Invention It is therefore a princIpal object or this invention to provide a new apparatus for use in a Newspaper conveyor system that can effectively transport signature copies vertically ni.le Simultanenusly ettectiGg E rct tc reorientation thereof. Another object of tis invention is to provide signature conveying apparatus having a pair of opposed belts positioned to between them grip the center area of the signature stream and convey the stceam upwardly while simultaneously effecting reorientation thereof. An additional object is to provide a belt transfer and reorfenting systems which reduces the localized pressure on the signatures and thereby minimizes the local damage caused by wire conveyor systems. A further object of this invention is to provide an improved signature conveyor apparatus which utilized opposed endless belts to grip the signatures and which includes means to guide the lateral edges of the signatures as they are physically reoriented. Other objects and advantages of this invention will be in part obvious and in part e xplained, by reference to the accompanying specification and drawings, in which Brief Description of the Drains Fig. 1 is a side elevation of the apparatus of this invention with part of the lower supporting structure removed for clarity Fig. 2 Is a front elevation of the apparatus orFig. 1, with the lower most imput feeder removed and part of the upper supporting structure renoved for clarity Fig. 3 is a schematic showing the manner in which the conveyor belts twist and Fig. 4 is partly sectioned schematic illustrating the manner in which the belts gP Description of the Preferred Embodiment Generaly, the apparatus of this invention is for use in a conveyot systen that is used for transporting newspaper signatures from tne press to solme other location where operations such AS sta s no are performed. The apparatus comprises basically a lower support frame means 10, and an upper suor frame means 11. Each of the support frame means 10 and 11 is comprised of a pair of vertically extending side rails 12, and a plurality of horizontally extending intermediate rails 13, which function to join the side rails 12 together.It will be noted that the upper support frame means 11 is mounted on the upper end of the lower support frame means 10 and that it is turned at an angle of 900 with respect to the lower portion. For purposes of explanation only, while the present description is done using an angle of 900 between the to sections, it should be understood that any other angle of orientation could be selected if desired.Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings, it can be seen that the lower support frame means is mounted on top of an infeed device 15 which receives the newspaper signatures from a horizontal conveyor, not shown, and directs them upwardly toward the lower support frame means 10 by means of a pair of opposed endless belts 16 and 17. Within infeed device 15, belt 16 is entrained about a plurality of rollers 18 which are journaled for rotation between the sides 19, only one of which is shown. In similar fashion, a plurality of rollers 20 are journaled in sines 19 to provide guiding means for t ne belt 17. The rollers 18 and 20 which are shown in Figure 1 as being furthest toward the right are placed a distance apart so that belts 16 atd 17 converge toward the centermost roll 13 to define a throat 21 into which signatures are fed.With belt 16 moving in the clockwise direction indicated by arrow 22 and belt 17 in the anti clockwise direction indicated by arrow 23, sinatures into throat 21 ill be carried from the horizontal to the vertical direction toward the lower support frame means . . Also journaled 1t4 an. sides 19 of infeed device 15 is a rotating nember that has a toiler 24 with a camming surfice 25 that slopes outwardly with respect co the axis of rotation of roll 24 This roller 24 and cammir g surrace 25 provide a belt biasing means that funcrior.s to retain the belts generally midway between side rails 12. Lower frame means 10 contains a plurality of horizontally extending belt guide rollers 31 and 32 which are journaled for rotation between side rails 12 Uppermost roller 32 is journaled in socket members 33, see Figure 2, that are carried on a threaded rod 34 so that by turning handle 35 roller 32 can be moved toward or away from opposed belts 16 and 17. Provision of this adjustable movement is important to successful operation of the present conveyor system because it enables the endless belts 16 and 17 to retain the signatures in the center of the support frame means 10 and 11 regardless of the thickness of the signatures that are being conveyed.Guide roller 30 is identical in construction to roller 24 and it provides a camming surface 36. By referring toFigure 2 it can be seen that camming surface 25 and camming surface 36 are oriented facing each other so that they cooperate with each other in centering belts 16 and 17. As mentioned earlier, upper support frame means 11 is mounted on top of lower frame means at some preselected angle, here illustrated as being at 900.Thus, in this illustration the lowermost guide roll 40 journaled between side fails 12 of upper frame support means 11 has its exis of rotation turned at a 90 angle with respect to the axes of rotation of the various rolls journaled in frame means 10 and infeed section 15. Also carried by the upper frame means 11 are a plurality of guide, tenssaning and drive rollers which coact with either one OL the belts 1S and and 17 or both. Speci√¨cally coactinti with belt 17 is guide roll 41 that is journaled on arm 42 fastened to an upper side rail 12. Tensionlng rolls 45 and 46 are journaiec on arm 47 chat is nivotally attached to sine tail 12. Arm 47 has its outer end left end as viewed in Figure 2 biased opwardly by tsinin sprint 50 that is connecte to arm 47 at one end and to side rail 12 through mounting rod and bracket 51. The drive foll for belt 17 is indicated by the numeral 55. Roll 55 is driven by motor 56 through the gear box 57. Belt 15 is guided, tensioned and driven in the same manner as belt 17. Specifically it passes by a guide roller 60 journaled in side rails 12 over drive roll 61 driven by motor 62 through gear box 63 and over tensioning rollers 64, 65 mounted on arm 66 that is pivotally carried on side rail 12. This arm is biased like arm 47 by a tensioning spring 67 that is connected between its outer end right as viewed in Figure 2 and mounting rod and bracket 68, the bracket being joined to side rail 12. Finally, belt 16 passes around guide roller 75 that is journaled on arm 76 mounted on side rail 12. One final guide roller is identified by nuneral 8C and this roll serves as a guide for both belts 16 and 17 before they begin to separate for their respective return runs. Since the support frame means 10 and li side rails 12 and the various guide, arrive, biasing and tensioning rollers are disposed or oriented as above described, it is apparent that the belts 16 and 17 will be twisted through whatever preselected angle is created between the axes of the rolls supported by upper and lower france means 10 and 11. The twist thaL is created is illustrated in Figure 2 where tie return run of belt 16 is shown as it exists between the uer chide roller 75 ana lower guine roller 3i. Turning to tne general functioning or operation or the bells 16 and 17, belt 17 moves downwardly fr drive roll 55, around tensioning rollers ill5, 46, guide rollers 41, 40, 32, calming guide roller 25, and finally around the lowermost guide rollers 20, prior to starting a return run upwardly. Belt 16 is guided in like fashion. Starting with drive roll 61 it moves downwardly around rollers 64, 65, 75, 31, 30 and finally around rollers 18 before starting its return run upwardly. Both belt 16 and belt 17 on the downward runs are twisted 900 in the manner shown inFigure 3 which illustrates the twist in belt l√≥. After belts 16 and 17 have converged at throat 21 they come together so that signatures, such as that identified by numeral 85 will be trapped and held between them. As the belts travel upwardly together carrying the signatures, they are guided by the guide rolls 31 and 32 so that the signature assumes the position identified by numeral 86. As signatures continue on upwardly they are twisted with the belts so that they move from the orientation of station 86 to an intermediate position such as that shown at station 87. Continuing on, the signatures twist further until they have achieved the total preselected orientation and are positioned as shown at station 88. During reorientation of the signatures from position 86 to te final position 88 it is essential that the lateral edges of the signatures be retained in the same relative positions with repect to each other throughout.This is effectively accomplished by means of a pair of guide means 90 and 91. Each guide means comprises an elongated plate like element having terminal edges 105, 106 which are parallel to the axes of rotation of the adjacent guide rolls 40 and 32 respectively. Linus each guide element 90, is formed with a twist that corresponds to the preselected angle that exists between the axes or rotation of the guide rollers in trite lower and upper support frame means 10 and 11. lillen a signature travels upwardly from point 86 91 hayned roller 32 its lateral edges come into contact with guide elements 90 and 91.Continued travel combined with the imparted twist causes the edge portiors of the signatures to be urged against elements 90 and 91, thereby insuring that they are held in fixed relationship with respect to each other. By means of this apparatus it thereby becomes possible to effectively transport newspaper signatures vertically while simultaneously effecting a change in the direction of travel. Although the present invention has been disolved in connection with the preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that modifications and variations may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as those skilled in the art will rail understand. Such modifications and variations are considered to be within the purvieur and scope of the invention and the appendid claims.
