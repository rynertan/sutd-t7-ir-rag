# Process and apparatus for electrostatic application of liquids or powders on substances or objects.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a process and an apparatus for electrostatic application of liquids or powders on many different substances and objects, by means of a cone 3 diffusing the substances or objets to be coated, in free fall continuously along the internal wall of a tube 4 where a high voltage positive corona zone 6 is produced, while the liquid or powder is sprayed from a centrifugal atomiser 10 , by which a high voltage negative corona zone 11 is produced, so that the liquid or powder is charged negatively and is attracted by the substances or objects charged positively and sliding on the wall of the tube.
