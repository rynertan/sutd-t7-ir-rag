# Shape selective acid catalyzed reactions of olefins over crystalline zeolites.

## Abstract
This invention provides a process for conducting selec tive acid catalyzed reactions with olefins using as catalysts, the acidic forms of a class of zeolites characterized by a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 12 and a constraint index of from greater than 2 to 12. Using such zeolites, smaller olefins are preferentially reacted when in mixed streams with larger olefins, linear olefins are preferentially reacted when in mixed streams with non linear olefins, lesser branched olefins are preferentially reacted when in mixed streams with more a highly branched olefins and para disubstituted and or mono substituted aromatic olefins will react preferentially over ortho and or meta disubstitutedor more highly substi tuted aromatic olefins.
