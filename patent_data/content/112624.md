# Balance valves.

## Abstract
A balance valve for maintaining two fluid pressure sys tems at a predetermined pressure relative to one another. The valve comprises a piston 2 slidably received within a bore 14 , and subjected on opposite ends to the pressure in the two systems. Each of the systems is provided with a re lief line 17, 20 whose communication with the associated system is controlled by movement of the piston such that any imbalance of forces acting on the piston causes the pis ton to be displaced to open the appropriate relief line to bal ance out the forces acting on the piston. Shock absorber means 25, 26, 28, 29 is provided to resist rapid movement of the piston, and respective springs 23, 24 may be pro vided for the purpose of centralizing the piston or for setting up a differential pressure in the two systems. The ports 21 of the respective relief lines are preferably triangular in shape such that a progressively greater area is uncovered in relation to the distance travelled by the piston.
