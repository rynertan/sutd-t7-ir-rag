# Preparation of water soluble cationic polymer and product.

## Abstract
Use of a dicarboxylic acid in the preparation of cationic water soluble polymers useful in flocculation of suspended solids in various waste waters is disclosed. The dicarboxylic acids are shown to improve stabilitv of cationic functionality and enhance distribution of charge.
