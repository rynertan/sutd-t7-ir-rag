# Trigger switch arrangements for a portable electric tool.

## Abstract
A portable electric tool has an elongated lever 16 pivoted 22 intermediate its length and contained fully within the tool housing 2 . The rear end 42 of the lever 16 operates a reversing switch 14 , and the forward end 24 of the lever engages in an actuating member 28 slidably along a transverse slot 74 in the lower wall 34 of the tool housing 2 . Intermediate the forward end of the lever 16 and its pivotal axis 22 , a downwardly projecting pin 36 coacts with a partition 40 in the upper part of the trigger 12 of a trigger switch 10 to prevent pivoting of the lever 16 while the trigger 10 is in an inward position engergizing the tool.
