# High melt strength elastomeric copolyesters.

## Abstract
An elastomeric copolyester resin having high melt strength and capable of being blow molded. The copolyester resin is made by adding to the polymerizing or initial mixture small amounts of an alkali salt of a daily sulfoisophthalate. The copolyester resin contains units of terephthalic acid, butane diol, polytetramethylene glycol, and dimer acid.
