# Electronic control method and apparatus for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A control apparatus for an internal combustion engine including sensors 2 14 for producing signals representative of operating conditions of the engine, actuators 64 72 for controlling respective energy conversion functions of the engine in response to control signals applied thereto, an input output unit 20 coupled to receive signals produced by the sensors and to deliver control signals to the actuators, a data processing unit 50 , coupled to the input output unit, for carrying out engine control data processing operations in accordance with signals produced by the sensors and thereby generating engine control values that are coupled to the input output unit, and a random access memory 54 supplied with an electric power separately from a common power source. The data processing unit constantly fetches signals flowing between the sensors and the input output unit and signals flowing between the input output unit and the actuators, and decides whether the respective fetched signals are normal or abnormal to thereby store the results of the decision as diagnosis data. The data processing unit stores a predetermined code in a predetermined area of the random access memory, carries out the engine control data processing operations in accordance with the diagnosis data, and writes the predetermined code in the predetermined area of the random access memory and clears data of all areas of the random access memory other than the predetermined area to thereby carry out the engine control data processing when the read data is decided not to be the predetermined data.
