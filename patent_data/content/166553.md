# Method and apparatus for unwrapping a plurality of short lines from a long line.

## Abstract
Method or apparatus for unwinding gangions from a long line 18 fishing line by first wrapping all of the gangions 24 in a first direction about the longline 18 and thereafter un wrapping them to leave them relatively free from the longline 18 . Wrapping and unwrapping can be accomplished by run ning the longline 18 through a series of hollow cylinders 40, 42 having permanent magnets mounted on the interior sur face. The cylinders 40, 42 are rotated in opposite directions. As the gangions 24 enter the first of the cylinders, the hooks are attracted to the magnets in the rotating cylinders 40, 42 and are rotated about the longline 18 so as to wind all of the gangions 24 in a common direction. Thereafter, the hooks are attracted to the magnets in the second cylinder, which is rotat ing in the opposite direction, thereby unwinding the gangions 24 . In this manner, regardless of the original wrap of the gangions 24 about the longline 18 , each can be completely unwrapped and left dangling from the longline 18 .
