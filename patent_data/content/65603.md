## Description
An adhesive composition This invention relates to adhesive compositions. The present invention relates to an unique and novel adhesive composition which comprises a certain neutralized sulfonated co or terpolymer and a hydrocarbon resin, to which compositions can optionally be added an ionic preferential plasticizer oil, and or a filler thereby modifying the rheological and physical properties of the adhesive compositions. Several U,S. Patents have described sulfonated polymers such as sulfonated Butyl and sulfonated EPDM in adhesive applications e.g.,U.S. 3,867,247 and U.S. 3,801,531 . It is important to distinguish the present invention over those and other prior art systems. The U.S.patent 3,867,247 is directed at a sulfonated Butyl cement which is solvent based and is employed to laminate various substrates. It is important to note that the present invention differs from that patent as follows a the invention is directed to sulfonated co or terpolymers formed by a copolymerization process whereas U.S. 3,867,247 deals with sulfonated Butyl rubber, which was formed by sulfonation of the Butyl rubber and b the polymers used in the present invention are chemically different from those of the patents above giving rise to different properties and capabilities. Also the present invention may optionally include a preferential plasticizer capable of associating with the metal sulfonate groups and thereby reducing the melt viscosity of the resulting blends to make the systems more processable.A. Sulfonated Polymer and Process for Forming The neutralized sulfonated co or terpolymers used in this present invention are formed by a copolymerization process. The normally solid sulfonated co or terpolymer of the present invention comprises at least 80 by weight of at least one conjugated diene having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule and a minor proportion of a metal or amine neutral ized sulfonate monomer, hereafter defined. The Co or terpolymer is water insoluble having 0.2 weight percent sulfur to 3 weight percent sulfur, chemically combined. The present invention involves the use of sulfonate containing copolymers which are preferabiy formed by a free radical copolymerization process. The monomers used in the free radical emulsion copolymerization process are conjugated dienes which are copolymerized with sulfonate containing monomers. In general, the conjugated diene and sulfonate containing monomer are dispersed in a water phase in the presence of an initiator which is preferably soluble in the conjugated diene phase and a suitable surfactant, wherein the temperature is sufficient to initiate polymerization. The resultant latex is coagulated usually by the addition of an aqueous salt solution and the recovered Co or terpolymer is washed with water and subsequently dried under vacuum at room temperature. The Co or terpolymers formed from the free radical emulsion copolymerization process can be generally described as having an Mn of 5,000 to 200,000 more preferably 10,000 to 100,000. The Co or terpolymers of the present invention contain 0.2 to 3 weight , preferably 0.5 to 3, more preferably 0.6 to 3y5iost preferof chemically combined , ably 0.7 to 2.0 weight sulphur. Typical, but non limiting examples of the copolymers which can be formed by the free radical emulsion copolymerization process are butadiene sodium styrene sulfonate copolymer, isoprene sodium sulfonate styrene copolymer, butadiene sodium vinyl sulfonate, isoprene sodium vinyl sulfonate copolymer.Obviously, an infinite number of copolymers and even terpolymers can be formed by the free free radical copolymerization of any conjugated diene as so defined herein with any sulfonate containing monomer as is defined herein. Terpolymers with styrene, acrylonitrile, vinyl chloride as the termonomers with the aforementioned dienes are also contemplated provided that no more than 10 weight percent of the termonomer is combined therein.CONJUGATED DIENES The conjugated dienes are generally defined as aromatic such as styrene, acyclic conjugated dienes containing from about 4 to about 10 carbon atoms per molecule more preferably about 4 to about 6 carbon atoms. T ypical, but non limiting examples of acyclic conjugated dienes are piperidene, 1,3 butadiene, isoprene 2 methyl l,3 butadiene , 2 ,3 dimethyl 1,3 butadiene, 1,3 pentadiene, methyl 1,3 pentadiene, 2,3 dimethyl l, 3 pentadiene, 3 methyl 1,3 pentadiene, 2 phenyl butadiene, chloroprene and piperidene. Typical, but non limiting examples of cyclic conjugated dienes are cyclopentadiene and methyl cyclopentadiene. The preferred conjugated dienes of are 1,3 butadiene, isoprene a t loroprene. In the formation of the sulfonate containing copolymer, one copolymerizes one of the aforementioned conjugated dienes with the sulfonate containing monomer. Sulfonate containing terpolymers can be readily formed by copolymerizing the sulfonate containing monomer with a mixture of two of the above identified conjugated dienes. Other suitable monomers which can be copolymerized with a sulfonate containing monomer are styrene, butadiene styrene, ethylene, vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate and methylacrylate and mixtures thereof. SULFONATE CONTAINING MONOMERS The sulfonate containing monomers which are water soluble can be generally described as a monomer having unsaturation and a metal or amine sulfonate group. The metal or amine neutralized sulfonate monomer is characterized by the formula EMI3.1 where X is CH2 ni where n 5 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or aromatic,EMI4.1 tb or SEP X SEP can SEP be tb SEP C O tb SEP 0 tb EMI4.2 or where m 0, 1, 2, 3 4 and Y is a cation selected fromGroups IA, IIA, IB and IIB of the periodic table or an amine of the formula EMI4.3 where R1 and R2 are aliphatic groups of C1 to C12 or hydrogen.Particularly suitable metal cations are sodium, potassium, and zinc, and an especially preferred metal cation is sodium. Typical but non limiting examples of suitable sulfonate containing monomers are 1 CH, CHSOR Na sodium vinyl sulfonateEMI4.4 tb 2 SEP CH2 SEP SEP CHCH2SO3 SEP Na SEP sodium SEP allyl SEP sulfonate tb 3 SEP 2 SEP SEP SO3 SEP NO SEP sodium SEP sty rene sulfonate An especially preferred sulfonate containing monomer is sodium sulfonate styrene. The molar ratio of sulfonate containing monomer to conjugated diene is preferably 1 200 to 1.5. The redox emulsion polymerization recipe used in this invention is effective in initiating the copolymerization of water insoluble and water soluble comonomers in an emulsion system. Because the peroxide initiator is dissolved in the monomer and the redox activator is dissolved in the water, the surface of the micelle growing polymer particle is believed to be the locus of formation of initiator molecules as well as the polymerization locus.Water phase homopolymerization of the polar, water soluble monomer is effectively depressed because of low primary radical concentration in the aqueous phase However other initiators are also contemplated for preparation of these systems. A variety of free radical catalysts can be em ployed. This includes a preferential class of free radical initiators such as benzoyl peroxide, cumene peroxide, t butyl hydroperoxide and similar systems which will be preferentially soluble in the monomer phase as opposed to the aqueous phase. There are a large number of such peroxides used in the art and those having the appropriate solubility behavior and suitable decomposition temperatures in the presence of the reducing agents are satisfactory for the purposes of this invention. Water soluble initiators may also be employed, although the characteristics of the products may be different. The surfactants employed for this process are varied and well known in the art. The typical emulsifiers or surfactants can be employed, however, some are more effective than others in generating latexes of better stability. A preferred emulsifier is sodium lauryl sulfate. The buffering agents employed in the polymerization process include sodium carbonate, ammonia, sodium acetate, trisodium phosphate etc. These buffering agents are employed at a concentration of 0.1 to 5 grams 100 grams water employed in the emulsion system. Chain transfer agents can be readily employed in the polymerization process for controlling the molecular weight of the resultant copolymer. The concentration of chain transfer agent is .05 to 0.5 grams 100 grmas of the combined weight of the sulfonate containing monomer and the conjugated diene. The free radical emulsion copolymerization of the water soluble sulfonate containing polymer and the conjugated diene yields a stable latex, wherein the resultant water insoluble co or terpolymer is not ccvalently crosslinked and possesses substantial ionic crosslinking, and has 0.2 to 3 weight percent of chemically combined sulfur The resultant latex can be coagulated by the addition of an aqueous salt solution to the emulsion at a volume ratio of the aqueous salt solution to total volume of the emulsion of 10 to 0.5. The water insoluble Co or terpolymer is recovered by filtration and subsequently washed with water and dried under vacuum conditions at about warm temperature. Alternatively, the polymer can be coagulated by precipitation with alcohol such as methanol.B. Plasticizers The metal sulfonate containing polymers at higher sulfonate levels can possess extremely high melt viscosties and are thereby difficult to process. The optional addition of ionic group preferential plasticizers markedly reduces melt viscosity and frequency enhances physical properties. To the neutralized sulfonated coor terpolymer is added, in either solution or to the crumb of the sulfonated co or terpolymer, a preferential plasticizer consisting of carboxylic per molecule acids having 5 to 30 carbon atoms, more pre ferably 8 to 22 carbon atoms, or basic salts of these carboxylic acids, wherein the metal ion of the basic salt is aluminimum, ammonium, lead or Groups IA, IIA, IS or IIB of the Periodic Table of Elements or mixtures thereof.The carboxylic acids may be lauric, myristic, palmitic or stearic acids or mix tures thereof e.g., zinc stearate magnesium stearate, or zinc laurate. The preferential plasticizer is incorporated into the neutralized sulfonated Co or terpolymer at 3 to 75 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the neutralized sulfonated Co or terpolymer. Alterna tively, other preferential plasticizers are selected from amines, amides such as stearamide, ammonium and amine salts of carboxylic acids and mixtures thereof. The preferred plasticizers are selected from carboxylic ner .Der . acias naving d to 22 carDon atoms or metallic. salts or these carboxlic acids or mixtures thereof. The resultant neutralized sulfonated Co or terpolymer with preferential plasticizer is isolated from the solution by conventional steam stripping and filtration.C. Commercial Tackifier Resins To the hot melt adhesive composition is added a commercial tackifying resin having a softening point of o to 1600C, more preferably 50 to 1400C and most preferably 70 to 120or. A variety of commercial tackifier resins are available. Some of these resins contain g and or pinene base polyterpene resins as the main ingredient while others are derived from the polymerization of petroleum or coal distillates which consist of aliphatic dienes, mono and di olefins and cyclic olefins having about 5 to about 6 carbon atoms. The latter type of tackifiers have primarily piperlene and or isoprene structure.A general but excellent description of tackifying resins derived from petroleum derivatives can be found in, for example, Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology,Vol. 9, Pages 853 to 860, chapter by John Findlay, published by John Wiley Sons, NY 1968 . Typical but non limiting tradenames of these commercial tackifiers are Wingtak of Goodyear, Escorex ofExxon , Piccolyte of Hercules and Zonrez of Arizona Chemicals. Recently these and various other companies have also started marketing relatively higher softening point resins. These are generally modified aliphatic hydrocarbon resins and or hydrogenated polycyclics. The physical appearance of these commercial tackifying resins varies, depending upon their softening point, they can be either viscous liquid or light colored solids at room temperature. Most often their initial color Gardner is 3.0 to 7.0 and the density from 0.7 to 1.0 3 gm cm3 at room temperature. The acid number of these resins is usually less than 1.In general, the molecular weight of these commercial tackifying resins is not homogeneous, it spreads the number average molecular weight Mn can be from 300 to 5000. As well known to this familiar with the use of tackifying resins, because of their wide range compatability, any of them can be used with sulfonated polymers in proper formulation, which will yield adhesive systems of varying physical characteristics. To cite an example in the present invention, the tackifying resins used are those based on hydrocarbon resins. These hydrocarbon tackifier resins are incorporated into the hot melt adhesive composition at 25 to 700 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of neutralized sulfonated Co or terpolymer.D. Method of Forming Blend Adhesive Composition The blend compositions of the neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer with or without preferential plasticizer and the hydrocarbon tackifier resin can be formed by blending techniques well known in the art. For example, the blend composition of the hot melt adhesive can be compounded on a hot two roll mill. Other methods known in the art which are suitable for making these compositions include those methods employed in the plastic and elastomer industries for mixing polymer systems. An excellent polymer blend composition of this invention can be obtained through the use of a high shear batch intensive mixer called,the Banbury. Alternatively, economic advantages in terms of time and labor savings can be obtained through the use of a Farrel Continuous Mixer, a twin screw extruder, or tandem extrusion techniques which are continuous mixing types of equipment. The Banbury mixing device is the preferred batch type mixer, and the twin screw extruder is the preferred continuous mixer.E. Extended Blend Adhesive Composition To the blend compositions of the hot melt adhesive compositions can be added fillers which are selected from ground calcium carbonate, water precipitated calcium carbonate, delaminated, calcined or hydrated clays, silicas carbon blacks and mixtures thereof. These fillers are incorporated into the blend composition at 5 to 800 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the neutralized sulfonated Co or terpolymer. Typically, these fillers have a particle size of 0.03 to 20 microns, more preferably 0.3 to 10, and most preferably 0.5 to 10. The oil adsorption as measured by grams of oil adsorbed by 100 grams of filler is 10 to 100, more preferably 10 to 85 and most preferably 10 to 75. Typical fillers employed in this invention are illustrated in Table I.

Oil Extended Adhesive Compositions It is observed that the blend composition of the present invention can also include oils further to improve low temperature properties and tack characteristics of the resulting adhesive Levels of oil of 1 to 100 parts by weight per 100 parts of the neutralized sulfonated co or terpolymer can be incorporated.Oils are partcularly useful when high levels of petroleum resin tackifiers are used since such materials can harden the resulting composition. Oils can further soften and reduce the cost. Typical oils that can be used may be low viscosity aromatic, naphthenic or paraffin petroleum oils. Typical oils are illustrated in Table II.G. In addition other polymers can be incorporated into the compositions of this invention such as polyisobutylene, ethylene propylene copolymer or ethylene propylene diene terpolymer, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers, natural rubber, polyisoprene, cis 1,2 polybutadiene, 1,4 polybutadiene and similar polymers which are largely elastomeric and are reasonably compatible with the sulfonate copolymers or terpolymers of this invention as long as the added polymer does not constitute more than 90 parts by weight per 100 parts of sulfonate containing Co or terpolymer which is the primary ingredient of this invention.

Method of Fabrication of Adhesive Comositions Because of the significant advances in the packaging technology, the hot melt adhesive compositions can be used by conventional polymer fabricating techniques. After the blending is complete, the adhesive mass can either be extruded and or calendered to a uniform thickness on top of the substrate which could be paper, cloth, aluminum foil or glass fabric.The temperature and the through put of the extrusion are variable epend ing upon the viscosity of the tackifying mass and the desired coating thickness. Typically the temperature of extrusions and rolls may be from about 2000 to 4000F.The substrates or backings to which the pressure sensitive adhesive compositions are applied may be of various porous or nonporous types and they may be organic or inorganic in nature. Most generally, these materials are those which are customarily employed in pressure sensitive tapes, either the cloth or paper backed types or tape backings made of synthetic materials, for example, polyesters such as the copolymer of ethylene glycol with terephthalic acid, vinyls such as a copolymer of vinylidene chloride and vinyl chloride, or a copolymer of vinylidene chloride with acrylonitrile, cellophane, cellulose acetate, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate, polypropylene, polyethylene, ethylene propylene plastic copolymer.Sheetings and tapes of cloth or textiles of either natural or synthetic fiber origin, such as glass fiber cloth, wood, and finally sheets or strips of metals such as steel, copper, aluminum and alloys thereof can also be employed.In general, the backings employed are those which have heretofore been conventionally employed in preparing pressure sensitive labels, tapes, sheetings and the like and the selection of any particular substrate material is not a specific novel feature of the present invention. The advantages of the hot melt adhesive compositions of the present invention can be more readily appreciated by reference to the following Examples and tables. Unless otherwise specified, all measurements are in parts per hundred by weight. The peel strength values were obtained by a method similar to ASTM D 429 adhesion test. In brief, the samples were sandwiched between mylar sheets and pressed to a thickness of about 25 mils using a hot press.Rectangular strips of 1 2 width and 3 long were cut and 900 peel tests were performed on an Instron at room temperature. The resin free sections of the mylar film were clamped into air jaws to avoid any slippage during pulling.The samples were pulled at 5 min. crosshead speed. The force and elongation of the samples were recorded on a strip recorder. The force necessary to separate the mylar sheets was taken as the peel strength of the blend.The initial peak values are reported in the fifth column of Table IV. The following preparations describe the synthesis of an isoprene sodium styrene sulfonate copolymer and an butadiene sodium styrene sulfonate copolymer.Example 1 A copolymer of sodium styrene sulfonate and butadiene. The following were charged into a polymerization vessel water distilled 200 partsTween 80 9.2 partsSodium Pyrophosphate 1.2 parts Triethylenetetralnine 25 solution 8.0 partsPiisopropylbenzene Hydroperoxide 25 solution 8.0 partsSodium Styrene Sulfonate 8.0 partsButadiene 77.3 parts l Dodecanethiol 148 solution 4.0 parts The polymerization was conducted at a temperature of 200C for 20 hours. At that time 12 ml of methanolic solution containing 0.8 hydroquinone and 1.2 ditertiary butyl phenol was added to the latex. The resulting product was precipitated in methanol. The copolymer was gel free and contained 0.46 percent chemically combined sulfur, had a reduced viscosity measured in a mixed solvent of 95 toluene at 5 methanol of 1.7 and had at least 80 by wt. of butadiene.Example 2 A copolymer of sodium styrene sulfonate and butadiene was prepared as described in Example 1. The product contained 0.49 chemically combined sulfur was fully soluble in a mixed solvent of 95 toluene at 5 methanol, and had at least 80 by wt. of butadiene. Example 3 A copolymer of sodium styrene sulfonate and isoprene. The following were charged into a polymerization vessel Water distilled 1958 partsSodium Lauryl Sulfate 30 solution 117.3 partsSodium Pyrophosphate Na4P207 10H2O 8.6 partsAmmonium Ferrous Sulfate NR4 2Fe SO4 26R2O 8.6 partsSodium Styrene Sulfonate 96 parts l Dodecanethiol 4.5 partsBenzoylperoxide 70 in water 5.0 partsIsoprene 912 parts The polymerization was conducted at a temperature of 22 to 250C for about 24 hours. At that time a solution of methanol 80 parts containing about 9.4 parts of ditertiary butyl phenol and 0.6 parts of hydroquinone was added to the latex. The resulting product was precipitated into methanol saturated with sodium chloride and the resulting precipitate filtered two times with water. The product was a tacky, elastic solid, containing 1.3 chemically combined sulfur, had a reduced viscosity of 0.7 dl g in a mixed solvent of 95 xylene and 5 methanol, and had at least 80 by weight of conjugated diene.Example 4 A copolymer of sodium styrene sulfonate and isoprene was prepared as described in Example 3 with the exception that the reaction was stopped after 10 hours.The copolymer contained 0.38 chemically combined sulfur, was gel free as demonstrated by its solubility in a mixed solvent of 95 toluene and 5 methanol, and had at least 80 by weight of conjugated diene. A thin film compression molded at 1800C had the following tensile properties modulus at 1008 elongation 34 psi, ultimate strength 79 psi, and ultimate elongation 620 .Example 5 The four products of the previous examples were melt blended with commercial petroleum tackifier resins commonly employed in the adhesive industry. Two such resins are known by their tradenames as Escorez 2101 marketed by Exxon Chemical Corporation and Wingtak Plus marketed by Goodyear . These solid resins soften at temperatures of 60 to 1000C, are low molecular weight polymers of about 1000 number average obtained by the copolymerization of aliphatic dienes, monoolefins and cyclicolefins. These materials were blended with the sulfonate copolymers on a hot two roll mill incorporating someIrganox 2246 as a protective antioxidant. The resulting blends were very tacky at elevated temperatures, and remained so at ambient temperatures.To test the peel strength of these blends they were compression molded between sheets of oriental polyester film blylar with the final thickness of the adhesive being about 25 mil. In all cases the blends appeared clear indicating excellent homogeneity and compatibility. The blends and their respective properties are shown in Tables III and IV.

It is evident from the data in Table IV that these compositions even in unoptimized form possess a high level of tack clarity, and peel strength. Such systerms offer a balance of adhesive properties which appear quite different from others described in the prior art. It is also contemplated that the compositions described in the present invention can be deposited by solvent casting from suitable solvent systems. Due to the strong ionic associations prevalent with these sulfonated ionomers, suitable solvents must be selected with care.Often solvent mixtures comprising a hydrocarbon and a low level of a polar cosolvent can be employed such as 5 to 108 by volume of a volatile alcohol.
