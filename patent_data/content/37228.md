# SIX WHEEL SPINNING SHIRRING HEAD

## Abstract
A shirring head wherein there are a plurality of shirring wheels spaced about the circumference of a shirring mandrel and so mounted that the shirring wheels may be individually driven in unison with one another while at the same time the faces of the shirring wheels opposing the shirring mandrel extend substantially continuously about the shirring man drel. The shirring wheels are carried by a supporting head which is mounted for rotation so as to rotate the shirring wheels about the axis of the shirring mandrel in addition to the rotation of the shirring wheels about their own axes. A differential drive is provided wherein the speed of rotation of the shirring wheels is modified in accordance with the speed and direction of rotation of the supporting head. The differential drive provides for an input to the drive for the shirring wheels from the drive for the supporting head.
