# An acoustic fluid flow meter.

## Abstract
An acoustic fluid flow meter including a pair of ultraso nic transducers 18,20 mounted on one wall 24 of a conduit 12 , and an opposite reflective wall 26 shaped to focus acoustic signals 28 from one transducer to the other. In a second embodiment, the opposite wall is separated into a stepped series of cylindrical reflective surfaces spaced from the transducers by different distances, each surface being one half wavelength from its adjoining surfaces so that constructive combination of the acoustic signals occurs. For noise of the same wavelength emitted at sources axially spaced from the transducers, the reflective surfaces appear to be spaced by approximately 3 4 wavelength steps so that reflected noise signals tend to cancel.
