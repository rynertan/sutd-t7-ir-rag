# Single facer for corrugated board.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a single facer for corrugated board of the kind comprising upper and lower corrugating rolls 1, 2 having meshing flutes, and a pressure member 3 disposed close to said lower roll 2 to provide an opposed surface in conformity with the rotational surface of said lower roll 2, said pressure surface having a length, in the circumfe rential direction of the lower roll 2, greater than the distance â„“ between two adjacent flutes of said roll. An object of the invention is to reduce the friction bet ween the pressure surface of the pressure member and a liner web 5 fed thereacross. The invention is characterised by means 13 for forming a gaseous layer between the pressure surface 12a of the pres sure member 10a and the liner web 5 fed between the lower corrugating roll and said pressure member, whereby to reduce friction forces on said liner web during pressing together and pasting of said web and a corrugated web 6 carried on the lower roll 2. Preferably, the means comprise a plurality of bores 13 extending through the pressure surface which communicate with a source of air or gas each bore may be normally closed by a spring biased valve 15 which projects above said pres sure surface, said valve being opened by pressing action between said liner and corrugated webs as they pass thereac ross.
