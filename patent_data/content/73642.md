# MACHINES FOR LASTING HEEL SEAT PORTIONS OF SHOES

## Abstract
In heel seat or combined side and seat lasting machincs, the shoe is first located relative to lasting instrumentalities 18 112 lengthwise by a heel band 16 114 and heightwise by a holddown 20 . To pre vent dislodging the upper on its last by moving it height wise relative to the heel band, and to prevent damage to insole, e.g. by scuffing, by moving the shoe length wise relative to the holddown, firstly the holddown is mounted for limited pivotal movement so that, after engagement by the shoe, it can move lengthwise there with, and secondly, the holddown is engaged by the shoe while out of engagement with the heel band. To achieve this, either the shoe is first located lengthwise by the heel band 16 , is then retracted, positioned heightwise, and then returned to its lengthwise location, or, as it moves lengthwise, the shoe is caused to engage the holddown before it reaches the heel band 114 .
