# CRYSTALLISATION OF SUGARS

## Abstract
Sugar sucrose or glucose is crystallised by passing a hot supersaturated syrup to a continuous screw extruder such that progressive nucleation of the syrup is induced dur ing a mean residence time of below 25 seconds and then discharging the nucleated syrup onto a surface, e.g. a con veyor belt, to crystallise without agitation.
