# Display tube.

## Abstract
A flat panel display tube having a large area screen, typically of 1 MÂ², is disclosed. In order to prevent the walls of the envelope 10 from imploding supporting walls 22 are provided to divide the interior of the envelope into a plurality of modules. Each module has its own electron beam generating means 24 for producing a low voltage, low current, intensity modulated electron beam 26 which is directed vertically upwards. A laminated channel plate electron multiplier 28 is disposed across the module and extends substantially parallel to the front and rear walls 12, 14 of the envelope. In the embodiment illustrated, a single column of channels is provided in the electron multiplier 28 , the spacing of which channels determines the vertical resolution of the repro duced image. In order to deflect the electron beam 26 into a particular channel, a plurality of deflector electrodes 30 are disposed on the rear wall 14 . These electrodes 30 and the input dynode of the electron multiplier 28 are generally held at the same potential to define a field free space. However in order to deflect the electron beam 26 , the potential applied to electrodes 30 ahead of the deflection point is reduced so that the beam is deflected towards the selected channel in the electron multiplier 28 . The current multiplied electron beam from the output of the electron multiplier 28 undergoes focusing, horizontal deflection and post deflection acceleration as a result of suitable voltages applied to electrodes provided on the supporting walls 22 . These electrodes may be parallel to each other or may diverge in a direction towards the front wall 12 .
