## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION A Fishing Hook BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an improvement wrought to the end portion of a fishing hook. A fishing hook used in angling has usually a pointed tip at its end portion, and such form is taken conventionally as best suited of a fishing hook. Since a fishing hook has frequent chances to get hard impact against the rocks.or pebbles on the sea bottom or the river bed, when used in angling, it is often the case that its pointed tip inflict damages by such impacts. Moreover, such damages thus incurred will deprive the hook of its sharp pointed tip, and as the result the manner of its piercing into the fish bodies is no always ideal.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based in forming a blade at the end part of a fishing hook, thus giving a solution to the problematic point with the conventional fishing hook and offering a novel fishing hook provided with an improved performance.

Fig. 8A is a side view and Fig. 8B is its front view of a fishing hook showing still another embodiment of the invention. Figs. 9 and 10 show an application of the invention to other types of fishing hook.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Hereinafter, the description in details will be given on the constitution of a fishing hook according to the present invention A fishing hook 1 in accordance with this invention consists of a fishing line tying portion 3, a stem part 4, a bosom part 5 and an end part 6 whereon blade being formed to constitute a blade line 2 as the tip portion of the fishing hook. Figs. 1 and 2 show the case when the top line of the blade 2 forms approximately 900 against the stem of the hook, as the fishing hook is seen from the side angle. In regards to the forms of the blade line 2, following various types can be conceived Figs. 3 and 4 show the case when the inside tip of the blade line is higher than outside or, in other words, when the apex line of the blade 2 is formed larger than 900 against the stem of the hook. Fig. 5 and 6 show the case when the apex line of the blade 2 has a circular curve or, in other words, when the tip portion of the hook takes the form of a fan, as it is seen from the side angle. Fig. 7 shows a form of the tip of hook having bent in a curved shape or, in other words, its apex line of the blade has a round top.Besides these, it is possible to form the blade part of the hook so that the apex line of the blade 2 has, for instance, a concave profile. Above are the descriptions of the fishing hook when it is seen from the side angle. It is possible, however, as shown in Fig. 8, as it is observed from the front side, to form the hook so that the apex line of the blade has a straight line or a curved line. That is to say, regardless of the angle of observation nor the form of the apex line of the blade part 2, the purpose of the invention can be attained as far as the tip of the fishing hook is imparted a blade part 2 instead of a pointed tip. By the way, Fig. 9 represents the case when the concept of the invention is adapted to a fishing hook for angling small fishes. Furthermore, Fig. 10 is the case in which the concept is adapted to a fishing hook for angling aye1 Japanese sweet fish . A fishing hook in accordance with this invention has an advantage in heightening the performance of a fishing hook in penetrating into the bodies of fishes, enabling the stem of hook to cut body of fishes sharply and instantly when contacting a fish with a blade provided. Another advantage of a fishing hook in accordance with this invention, the sharpness of the tip of a fishing hook can be maintained over a longer period of use as the result of the fact that the tip of the hook is a blade instead of a point, when compared with the conventional fishing hook. That is to say, the tip of a fishing hook tends to inflict damages, when used, by frequently making impact against hard substances such as rocks or pebbles on the river bed or the sea bottom. Being provided with a blade instead of a pointed head, however, a fishing hook in accordance with this invention has a superior resistance against breakage and abrasion, keeping the sharpness of the tip of the hook over a longer period.
