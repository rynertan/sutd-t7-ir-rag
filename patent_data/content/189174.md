## Description
The present invention relates to novel polymers obtained by the polymerization of substituted 1,3 butadiene compounds, and a process for their preparation. More particularly, the present invention relates to polydienes having reactive silyl groups and a process for their preparation. Conventional reactive silane compounds are, in many cases, intended for surface treatment of inorganic substances, and they are, in most cases, low molecular weight compounds. Further, polymerizable silane compounds such as vinyl compounds or methacrylate compounds having reactive silyl groups are known. However, such polymerizable silane compounds are intended for use in a small amount for the copolymerization with other plastic materials, and they have not usually used alone for polymerization. The present inventors have found that polymers having reactive silyl groups and carbon carbon double bonds which are not found in the conventional silane compounds, can be used for various applications. The present invention is based on this discovery. The present invention provides a polymer obtained by the polymerization of a substituted 1,3 butadiene compound of the formula Most of the polymer structure of the present invention has a unit of the formula Now, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the preferred embodiments. By virtue of the reactive silyl groups and carbon carbon double bonds, the homopolymer of the present invention is useful for an improvement of the impact resistance of plastics by imparting rubber elasticity to the surface of an inorganic filler, for the production of highly oriented magnetic substance by imparting rubber elasticity to the surface of magnetic substance, and for blending with a rubber, followed by co vulcanization, or it is useful for the cross linking by means of the reactive silyl groups, for an improvement of the hydrolysis resistance of e.g. FRP fiber reinforced plastics by the treatment of the surface of an inorganic filler and for applications to e.g. adhesives for glass, ceramics or rubber products. Further, it may be used for various other purposes. In some cases, the monomer of the substituted 1,3 butadiene compound may be added to the above material , and then polymerized. The copolymer of the present invention is likewise useful for an improvement of the heat resistance of plastics, for adhesives for glass, ceramics or rubber products, and for coupling agents, since it is readily crosslinkable by virtue of the reactive silyl groups and carbon carbon double bonds, and it is further useful for various other applications. The homopolymers and copolymers of the present invention may further be useful as anionic polymeric initiators to produce polymers having affinity with inorganic substances. Among them, living polymers are particularly useful as anionic polymeric initiators, for instance, for the preparation of living block copolymers. The polymers obtainable by these living polymers are useful for an improvement of the impact resistance of plastics by imparting rubber elasticity to the surface of inorganic fillers, for the production of highly dispersible magnetic material by coating the surface of the magnetic substance, and for blending with rubber, followed by co vulcanization, by virtue of the reactive silyl groups and carbon carbon double bonds. Further, they are useful for cross linking by means of the reactive silyl groups, for an improvement of the hydrolysis resistance of e.g. FRP by the treatment of the surface of inorganic fillers, and for adhesives for glass, ceramics or rubber products. They are further useful for various other applications such as for UV photo resists. Further, the living homopolymers of the present invention are useful as starting materials for living block copolymers with other unsaturated monomers such as styrene, α methylstyrene, 1,3 butadiene, isoprene, methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile, and for block copolymers obtained therefrom. They are useful as compatibility improvers for a blend with other polymers, for medical purposes by virtue of the microphase separation structures, and as impact resistance improvers. The novel polydiene having reactive silyl groups of the present invention are obtained by subjecting the substituted 1,3 butadiene compound of the formula I to homopolymerization or to copolymerization with an unsaturated monomer. The substituted 1,3 butadiene compound to be used for the polymerization of the present invention includes 1 trimethoxysilyl 1,3 butadiene, 1 triethoxysilyl 1,3 butadiene, 1 triisopropoxysilyl 1,3 butadiene, 1 tri n propoxysilyl 1,3 butadiene, 1 methoxydimethylsilyl 1,3 butadiene, 1 dimethoxymethylsilyl 1,3 butadiene, 1 trichlorosilyl 1,3 butadiene and 1 dimethylchlorosilyl 1,3 butadiene. Further, 2 trimethoxysilyl 1,3 butadiene, 2 triethoxysilyl 1,3 butadiene, 2 triisopropoxysilyl 1,3 butadiene, 2 tri n propoxysilyl 1,3 butadiene, 2 methoxydimethylsilyl 1,3 butadiene, 2 dimethoxymethylsilyl 1,3 butadiene, 2 trichlorosilyl 1,3 butadiene and 2 dimethylchlorosilyl 1,3 butadiene may also be employed. Further, the novel copolymers having reactive silyl groups and carbon carbon double bonds of the present invention can be obtained also by copolymerizing the substituted 1,3 butadiene compound of the formula I with one or more unsaturated monomers. Such unsaturated monomers to be used in the present invention include unsaturated hydrocarbons such as ethylene, propylene, acetylene, styrene and α methylstyrene, vinyl compounds such as vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile, acrylic or methacrylic esters such as ethyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate and n butyl methacrylate, diene compounds such as isoprene, chloroprene and butadiene, maleic acid derivatives such as maleic anhydride and di 2 ethylhexyl maleate, and unsaturated carboxylic acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and itaconic acid. There is no particular restriction as to the molecular weights of the homopolymers and copolymers of the present invention, which may be polymers or oligomers. Likewise, there is no particular restriction as to the proportions of the copolymer constituents. Any of radical polymerization, cationic polymerization and anionic polymerization may be employed for the process for the preparation of the polymer of the present invention. The radical polymerization may be initiated by application of high temperature heating and radiation or by means of an initiator. The initiator includes an azo initiator such as 2,2 azobisisobutyronitrile, a peroxide initiator such as benzoylperoxide, and a redox initiator composed of a combination of benzoylperoxide and N,N dimethylaniline. As initiators for the cationic polymerization, Lewis acid initiators such as aluminum chloride, boron trifluoride and dichloromonoethylaluminum may be mentioned. As initiators for the anionic polymerization, alkyl metals such as naphthalene sodium and n butyl lithium, and Ziegler type catalysts may be mentioned. In particular, the living polymerization initiators for the present invention include lithium naphthalide, sodium naphthalide, potassium naphthalide, oligo α methylstyryllithium, oligo α methylstyryl sodium, oligo α methylstyrylpotassium, cumyl potassium and n butyl lithium. However, by mere high temperature heating, the degree of polymerization of the homopolymer was rather low. Further, with an initiator having a low activity such as 2,2 azobisisobutyronitrile, the yield of a copolymer with a maleic acid derivative was rather low. The above polymerization reactions may be conducted by directly adding the initiator to the substituted 1,3 butadiene compound or to a mixture of the substituted 1,3 butadiene compound with an unsaturated monomer, or may be conducted in a solvent which does not adversely affect the polymerization reaction. With respect to such a solvent, the radical polymerization may be conducted in a solvent which is commonly used in a usual solution polymerization, such as toluene or ethyl acetate, and the cationic polymerization may preferably conducted in a halogenated hydrocarbon such as carbon tetrachloride, chloroform or methylene chloride. Further, for the anionic polymerization, benzene, toluene, hexane, cyclohexane, preferably ether type solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane may be used. The radical polymerization is conducted at a temperature of from 100 to 100 C, from 1 to 100 hours, preferably in the presence of a solvent. The cationic polymerization is conducted at a low temperature of from 100 C to room temperature, for 1 to 100 hours, preferably in the presence of a solvent. The anionic polymerization is conducted at a low temperature of from 100 C to room temperature, for from 0.1 to 100 hours, preferably in the presence of a solvent. The anionic polymerization reaction is conducted in an inert gas atmosphere in the absence of moisture or oxygen which adversely affects the polymerization reaction. The weight average molecular weight of the polymers obtained by radical polymerization was from about 500 to about 2,000,000. The weight average molecular weight of the polymers obtained by the cationic polymerization was from about 500 to about 10,000. Likewise, the weight average molecular weight of the polymers obtained by the anionic polymerization was from about 500 to about 500,000. The molecular weight of a living polymer can be controlled by adjusting the ratio of the substituted 1,3 butadiene compound to the anionic polymerization initiator. Namely, it is possible to increase the molecular weight by increasing the ratio. The living polymers thus obtained usually have a weight average molecular weight of from about 500 to about 500,000, preferably from about 2,000 to about 200,000, more preferably from about 5,000 to about 100,000, in view of the physical properties of the polymers obtainable from the living polymers. The living polymers and the polymers obtainable from the living polymers, are polymers having extremely narrow molecular weight distribution with the ratio of the weight average molecular weight to the number average molecular weight being close to 1.
