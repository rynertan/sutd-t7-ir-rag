# SQUARE ROOT EXTRACTOR CIRCUITS

## Abstract
A circuit 10 for extracting the square root of an incoming voltage signal utilizes a four bit up down counter 14 to control the output duty cycle of a pair of four bit rate multipliers 16, 18 connected in a cascaded configuration. The output of the second rate multiplier 18 , which is related to the square of the up down counter value, is used to control the mode of the counter 14 so as to track the incoming voltage signal. Inasmuch as the square of the up down counter value is tracking the incoming voltage signal, the output duty cycle of the first rate multiplier 16 in the cascaded pair is the square root of the incoming voltage signal which is subsequently converted into analog form. The circuit also utilizes a dithering technique so that the resulting square root output signal has greater than four bit accuracy.
