# Optical rotation detecting apparatus.

## Abstract
An optical rotation detecting apparatus for a brush less dc motor detects rotation information of the shaft 1 by the slits 25a arranged at equal pitches along the circumference of a rotary disk 22 and a photoelectric conversion element 27, 36 arranged circumferentially at a pitch which is an integral multiple or the slit pitch and including a first set of photoelectric conversion el ement pieces 27a, 36a and a second set of photoelec tric conversion element pieces 27b, 36b arranged alter nately with the former thereby generating a first rota tion information signal having a frequency proportional to the rotational speed of the shaft 1 and a second rotation information signal having a 90 degree phase difference with the first rotation information signal. The phases of the first and second rotation information sig nals are compared to detect the direction of rotation of the shaft 1 . The accuracy of rotation information can be further improved by increasing the number of photoelectric conversion element pieces per slit pitch. The photoelectric conversion element includes an amor phous silicon photoelectric conversion element.
