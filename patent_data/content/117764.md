# Coil device.

## Abstract
The distributed capacitance between coil turns in a coil de vice is increased, and a coil inductance and a low pass filter are formed, whereby overvoltages and high frequency voltages are suppressed. The increased distributed capacitance is at tained by inserting a ferroelectric insulator 54, such as a ce ramic material, between the coil turns or by winding a metal foil containing insulator film 64 in the shape of a tape, round a coil conductor.
