# Abbreviated typing with special form display.

## Abstract
In an abbreviated typing system, in which a data processor 20 transfers abbreviations typed on the keyboard 10 into longer, full words, display of words in exceptional forms is efficiently achieved. Such special forms include initial capitalized, all capitalized, initial italics, all italics and combinations of these. The sequence for capitalization is typical. When the first letter only of the abbreviation is capitalized, a decision of the processor 20 results in an action by which only the first character of the full word is capitalized. When more than one letter is capitalized, the decision of the processor 20 results in an action by which all characters of the full word are capitalized. Underlining is effected by underlining all characters when the first letter of the abbreviation is underlined and all of the characters plus the space following the word when more than one letter of the abbreviation is underlined.
