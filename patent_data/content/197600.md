# A device for the washing of eggs.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a device for washing of eggs in order to remove adhering dirt in which egg transport means and egg guiding means are present. The egg transport means 1,4 and egg guiding means 3 cooperate and form egg rotation means which cause an egg to rotate substantial ly around its shortest main axis dirt removal is achieved with use of one or more brushes and a washing liquid. The egg s longest main axis thereby remains substantially in a plane parallel to the direction of transport of the eggs, said plane being perpendicular to the plane going through the centerlines of the egg guiding means 3 .
