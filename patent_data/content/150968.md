# Cue signal recording circuit for magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A cue signal recording circuit for a magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus comprises an erase signal generator 12 for generating an erase signal having a relatively high fre quency, a symmetry varying circuit 13 responsive to a first external signal having a relatively low frequency for varying the symmetry of the waveform of the output erase signal of the erase signal generator at the relatively low frequency, a switch 14 having a first input terminal 14a applied with the output erase signal of the erase signal generator and a second input terminal 14b applied with an output signal of the symmetry varying circuit, where the switch is connected to the second in put terminal so as to pass the output signal of the symmetry varying circuit for a predetermined short time period and is thereafter connected to the first input terminal so as to pass the output erase signal of the erase signal generator responsive to a second external signal, and an erase head 18 supplied with the output signal of the switching for recording on a magnetic tape 19 a signal having the relatively low frequencv as a cue signal for the predetermined short time period and thereafter erasing pre recorded signals on the magnetic tape.
