# Flow regulating device.

## Abstract
A flow regulating device provides continuous, regulat ed flow of a medical fluid, as well as intermittent, manually controlled larger flows of fluid to a catheter system. Such apparatus includes a control member 10 having an inlet means 16a, 16c adapted to be connected by tubing 11, 17 to a source of medical fluid and an outlet means 16b, 16d adapted to be connected by tubing to a catheter. A flexible conduit 22 defines at least a portion of a first passage 24, 24a between the inlet means 16a, 16c and outlet means 16b, 16d of the control member 10 . Posi tioned in the flexible conduit 22 is valve means 23, 23a adapted to open when the conduit 22 is squeezed, thereby providing the larger, intermittent, manually controlled flow of fluid to the catheter system, and to automatically close when the conduit 22 is released. A second passage 25, 25a in the control member 10 connects the inlet 16a, 16c and outlet 16b, 16d means, and in combination with flow restriction means 25a therein, provides the continuous, regulated flow of fluid to the catheter system.
