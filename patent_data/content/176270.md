# Supercharger with reduced noise and improved efficiency.

## Abstract
An improved supercharger or blower 10 of the Roots type with reduced airborne noise and improved efficiency. The blower includes a housing 12 defining generally cylindrical chambers 32, 34 containing meshed lobed rotors 14, 16 having the lobes 14a, 14b, 14c, 16a, 16b, 16c thereon formed with an end to end helical twist according to the relation 360 2n, where n equals the number of lobes per rotor. In one embodiment, blower housing 12 also defines inlet and outlet ports 36, 38 . The inlet port includes longitudinal boundaries defined by housing wall surfaces 20f, 20h and transverse boundaries defined by housing wall surfaces 20g, 20i . The transverse boundaries 20g, 20i are disposed substantially parallel to the helical lobes. The outlet port includes longitudinal boundaries defined by housing surfaces 20m, 20r and a transverse boundaries defined by housing surfaces 20p, 20s . The inlet and outlet port openings are skewed in opposite directions to increase the time top lands of the lobes are in sealing relation with cylindrical walls 20a, 20b of chambers 32, 34 . Expanding orifices 42, 44 defined by the intersection of transverse boundaries 20p, 20s and longitudinal boundary 20m are disposed substantially midway between ends 14g, 14h and 16g, 16h of the lobe lands to reduce backflow noise.
