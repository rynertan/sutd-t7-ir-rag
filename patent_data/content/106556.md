# Multiprocessor computing system featuring shared global control.

## Abstract
A multiprocesor system 20 comprises a plurality of stations 22a 22d interconnected by a system communica tion bus 21 and cooperating in the performance of system tasks. Each station includes a plurality of addressable elements c k interconnected by a station communication bus b . All stations are mapped into a common address space 1001a , with the elements of each station mapped onto like relative addresses in two subspaces 1002a r of the address space a subspace which is shared in common by all stations, and a subspace dedicated to the station whose addresses are the common subspace addresses in combina tion with a station identifying address portion. The stations are symmetrical like elements in all of the station are mapped onto like relative addresses in their associated subspaces. Addressing within the system is self referential a station accesses one of its addressable elements by placing its common subspace address on the station communication bus. Each station s station bus b is selectively interfaced a to the system bus 21 , and a station accesses an addressable element of another station by placing its dedicated subspace address on the station bus, interfacing its station bus with the system bus, and causing the other station to interface its station bus with the system bus. A station accesses an element of another station passively, without utilizing the intelligence, if any, of the other station to make the access.
