# Solvent dewaxing of waxy hydrocarbon distillates.

## Abstract
This invention relates to solvent dewaxing processes, for dewaxing waxy hydrocarbon oils using a dewaxing aid, which dewaxing aid comprises a mixture of A polyalkyl acrylate having alkyl group side chain length of from 10 26 carbons excluding branching and B an n alkyl methacry late polymer having alkyl group side chain length of from 10 20 carbons excluding branching . Component A typi cally has a number average molecular weight of from 3,000 to 500,000 while component B typically has a number average molecular weight of from 5,000 to 200,000. The combination A plus B may be employed in a weight ratio within the range from about 1 100 to 100 1, preferably about 1 6 to 2 1 and at an aid does level ranging from about 0.01 wt to 1 wt , preferably 0.2 to 0.02 wt active ingredient.
