# FLUORESCENCE LASER EXAFS

## Abstract
Apparatus 10 for obtaining fluorescence laser EXAFS Extended X ray Absorption Fine Structure . A lens 12 directs a pulse of radiant energy 13 onto a metal target 15 to produce X rays 16 . A baffle 17 directs the X rays 16 onto a spectral dispersive monochromator 18 which directs the spectrally resolved X rays 16ER therefrom onto a sample 11 . Fluorescence X rays 27 from the sample 11 strike a phosphor 26 on a grid 19 . Emitted light 21 from the phosphor 26 corresponds spatially to the spectral resolution of the X rays 16R . Emitted light intensity at a point along the spatial distribution corresponds to the absorption characteristics of the sample 11 at a particular wavelength of the incoming X rays 16R . An imaging lens 20 directs the emitted light 21 onto photographic film or an array detector 22 . A reference spectrum of the spectrally resolved X rays 16R is obtained by placing photographic film or an array detector 29 in the path of the spectrally resolved X rays 16R so that only a portion of the X rays 16R throughout the spectrum strikes the film or array detector with the remaining portion throughout the spec trum allowed to pass to the sample 11 .
