# MEMBRANE SWITCHES

## Abstract
A membrane switch panel has a printed circuit base board 20 carrying bare copper electrical circuitry 26 and contacts 26 28 . A flexible, non elastomer, laminar membrane 22 overlays the board 20 and also carries a bare copper contact 24 . An electrically insulating spacer 3 is provided between the board 20 and the membrane, but it is provided with an opening to allow the contact 24 upon local depression of the membrane to bridge the contacts 26 28 in the base board 20 . The membrane 22 is adhesively sealed to the base board 20 enclosing an atmosphere of limited tarnishing ability for the contacts 20, 26 28 to maintain a low contact resistance and allow non precious metals to be used for contacts.
