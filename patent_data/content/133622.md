# SIMULTANEOUS PRODUCTION OF CLEAN DEWATERED AND CLEAN SATURATED STREAMS OF SYNTHESIS GAS

## Abstract
The hot raw effluent gas stream from a free flow partial oxidation gas generator is split into two hot raw gas streams which are separately processed. One split gas stream is cleaned by quenching and scrubbing with water. Entrained particulate carbon is removed therefrom as a carbon water dispersion from which it is extracted with a liquid organic extractant. The resulting liquid organic extractant carbon water dispersion is vaporized using the sensible heat from the other split gas stream. Particulate carbon is then removed from the other split gas stream by scrubbing with a liquid hydrocarbon fuel to separate out a liquid hydrocarbon fuel carbon dispersion which may be supplied to the gas generator as a portion of the feed. The remaining gaseous mixture is cooled and separated into a clean dewatered product gas stream, water, and liquid organic extractant. The latter two materials are recycled.
