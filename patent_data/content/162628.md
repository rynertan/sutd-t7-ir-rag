# Folding apparatus.

## Abstract
A folding apparatus for separating a web into individual signatures and producing two folds in each signature, com prises an upper cylinder 26 , a lower cylinder 28 and an intermediate cylinder 30 . Each of the cylinders is rotated about an axis, the axes 32, 34 of the upper and intermediate cylinders being parallel and spaced apart to define a given plane and the axis of the lower cylinder being parallel to the axes of the first and intermediate cylnders and offset from the plane thereof. The upper and lower cylinders rotate in the same direction and the intermediate cylinder in the op posite direction. First and second folding assemblies 50, 52 produce two folds in each signature. The first folding assem bly includes cooperating portions carried on the upper cyl inder and on the intermediate cylinder. The second folding assembly includes cooperating portions carried on the lower cylinder and on the intermediate cylinder. A cutting assembly 62 separates the web to produce the individual signatures 44, 44 . Each of the folding assemblies includes a tucker blade 54, 58 , having an axis, and a tucker blade mounting and control structure for mounting the tucker blade to one of the cylinders for compound pivotal motion comprising a motion which causes substantial alignment of the tucker blade axis with a given radius of the adjacent cylinder through a predetermined portion of cylinder rotation so as to urge the signature into a folded condition while substan tially preventing wiping engagement between the tucker blade and the signature.
