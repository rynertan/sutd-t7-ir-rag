# Sunflower regeneration through embryogenesis.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to the regeneration of sunflowers via embryogenesis. The process comprises the steps of a culturing tissue obtained from a sunflower plant on a first medium which comprises mineral salts, vitamins, amino acids, sucrose and a hormone in an amount sufficient to ensure embryogenic callus formation b subculturing said callus on a second medium which comprises mineral salts, vitamins, sucrose and a hormone in an amount sufficient to ensure embryo formation and germination of said embryo, and c subculturing said embryo or said germinated embryo on a third medium which comprises mineral salts, vitamins and sucrose, whereby plants are obtained.
