# SWITCH AND VALVE ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A switch and valve assembly for inflating or deflating a pair of bladders mounted in the back and seat regions of a vehicle seat. The assembly houses two normally closed valve assemblies and two normally open electrical switch assemblies, with two pushbutton actuated stems adapted to selectively either partially open the valve assemblies by partial depression of the pushbuttons to thereby bleed off fluid under pressure from respective bladders, or to fully open the valve assemblies while closing the switch assemb lies by full depression of the pushbuttons to thereby actuate the pump to provide fluid under pressure to fill the respective bladders as desired for operator riding comfort or support. Pressures in the two bladders may be changed individually or concurrently.
