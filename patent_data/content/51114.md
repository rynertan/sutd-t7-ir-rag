# A propagation track for a contiguous disk bubble device.

## Abstract
A propagation track for use in contiguous disk bubble devices includes a plurality of spaced dovetail shaped elements which are connected at one end thereof by a track portion 34 which faces in the direction of and is substantial ly perpendicular to the 1,1,2 axis. The first, third and fifth sides 34, 36, 41 of the dovetail structure are elongated and also face in the direction of and are substantially perpendicu lar to the 1,1,2 axis. The remaining sides of the dovetail structure have different orientations, the second side 38 facing in the direction of and being substantially perpendicu lar to the 2,1,1 axis, and the fourth side 40 facing in the direction of and being substantially perpendicular to the 1,2,1 axis. The orientation of the two cusps 45, 49 formed by the first and second sides 34, 38 and the fourth and fifth sides 40, 41 is such that the lines 43, 47 bisecting and pointing towards the cusps are substantially parallel to the 1,2,1 and 2,1,1 axes, respectively.
