## Description
Device for cmPlling window regulators i nx3torvehicles, particularly rrstor carsThe present invention relates to devices for controlling window regulators with electric motors in a motor vehicle.The device according to the invention is characteriscd in that each window regulator has associated therewith at least one relay connected between the electrical system of the motor vehicle and the motor of the window regulator in order to control the supply of working energy to the motor, and in that remote control units are provided comprising switches which are each connectible through low power conductors to the energisation circuit of one of the relays.By virtue of this characteristic, there is provided a device for controlling the electric window regulators of a motor vehicle, having good reliability, efficiency, convenience and safety in use, due to the fact that the control of the window regulators is effected by currents of the order of a few milliamperes, which are the typical energisation currents of the relays.Electrical conductors of reduced cross section, such as those generally called low power conductors, can therefore be used for connection to the control units of the window regulators.The control of the window regulators by means of relays ensures that only the relay energisation current passes through the switches of the control units, avoiding any risk to their users. At the same time, high currents can be used to supply the motors of the window regulators, improving the characteristics of speed and efficiency of operation of these motors.In particular, the device according to the invention is characterised in that the motor of each window regulator has associated therewith a pair of relays for activating the motor in the directions of raising and lowering the window respectively, and in that the connection arrangement of these relays is such that the simultaneous operation of the control switches associated with both the relays of each pair causes the interruption of the supply to the motor.This avoids possible damage to the motors of the window regulators due to simultaneous operation of the control switches for raising and lowering one of the windows.Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will appear from the description which follows, purely by way of non limiting example, with reference to the appended drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic plan view of a motor car equipped with a device for controlling electric window regulators according to the invention, andFigure 2 is a block schematic diagram illustrating the operation of the device shown in Figure 1.In Figure 1, a motor car, generally indicated A, has front windows with which there are associated window regulator devices driven by electric motors indicated M1 left hand side and M2 right hand side . Two control units, indicated Jl and U2, are situated respectively within reach of the driver and the passenger occupying the front right hand seat of the car. Each of the units U1 and U2 is provided with four push buttons for controlling the operation of the motors M1 and M2 in two directions to effect raising and lowering of the front windows of the carA.In particular, with reference to the unit U1, the push buttons which control operation of the motorM1 acting on the left hand window are indicated 1 and 2, while the push buttons which control the operation of the motor M2 associated with the front righthand window of the car are indicated 3 and 4.The four push buttons of the unit U2, each of which duplicates the operation of a corresponding push button of the unit U1, are indicated 11, 12, 13 and 14.Two relays, preferably relays of the automotive type, which control the operation of the motor M1 are indicated 5 and 6. Two similar relays 7 and 8 control the operation of the motor M2.A first bundle of low power cables, indicated D1, connects the control unit U1 to the energisation circuits Sa, 6a of the relays 5 and 6 Figure 2 .A similar bundle D2 of low power conductors connects the second control unit U2 to the energisation circuits 7a, 8a of the relays 7 and 8. As shown in the circuit diagram of Figure 2, diodes 5b, 6b, 7b and 8b are connected in parallel with the energisation circuits of all four relays to protect the latter against reverse polarisations and overvoltages.The two control units U1,U2 are connected together by means of a further bundle of low power cables, indicated D3. In the circuit diagram of Figure 2, the positive pole and the negative pole of the electrical system of the car A are indicated P and N respectively.The diagram of Figure 2 is substantially symmetrical about a horizontal lines . The portion of the diagram above the line i shows the connections of those components of the device on the left hand side of the car, while the portion of the diagram below the line illustrates the connections of those components of the device on the right hand side of the car.The diagram of Figure 2 is further subdivided into two parts, the first of which, shown on the left, has the low power components of the device, that is all the control components o the device which, in use, are passed through by modest currents of the order of milliamperes.The part of the diagram shown on the right of theFigure includes the power elements, that is those elements which, in use, are passed through by the operating currents of the motors Ml and M2.It should be understood, however, that this division is merely illustrative and that the energisation coils 5, 6a, 7a and 8a, and thus the protection diodes associated therewith, are in fact usually mounted on the corresponding relays 5, 6, 7 and 8 to which the control units U1 and U2 are connected through the bundles of low power cables D1, D2 and D3, not explicitly illustrated in Figure 2.The operation of the device according to the invention is readily understandable, it being noted that the push button 1 of the unit U1 and the push button 11 of the unit U2, which are connected in parallel with each other, are disposed electrically in series with the energisdtion circuit Sa of the relay 5 in the connection arrangement of this energisation circuit to the polesP and N of the electrical system of the car.In exactly the same way, the push buttons 2 and 12, which are in parallel with each other, are disposed in series with the energisation circuit 6a of the relay 6.A similar connection arrangement is provided for the energisation circuit 7a of the relay 7 disposed electrically in series with the push buttons 3 and 13, which are connected in parallel with each other, and for the energisation circuit 8a of the relay 8 disposed electrically in series with the push buttons 4 and 14, which are connected in parallel with each other.Thus, the arrangement is such that the energisation of each relay may be effected equally well by one or other of the control units U1, U2.With reference to the power part of the diagram ofFigure 2, it can be seen that the motor M1 is connected between the relays 5 and 6, each of which acts as a switch able to connect one of the supply terminals of the motor M1 selectively with the positive pole P or the new active pole N of the electrical system of the car.In exactly the same way, the motor M2 associated with the front right hand window of the car is connected between the relays 7 and 8 each of which can connect one of the supply terminals of the motor with one or other of the poles of the electrical system of the car.In the de energised condition, which is that illustrated schematically in Figure 2, the supply terminals of both the motors M1 and M2 are firmly connected to the negative pole earth of the electrical system of the car.A pressure exerted on the push button 1 , or, in an entirely equivalent manner, on the push button ll,causes the energisation of the relay 5 which connects the respective supply terminal of the motor Ml to the pole P of the electrical system. The motor M1 is thus activated causing, for example, the raising of the window with which it is associated.Once the window has been raised by the desired amount, the push button 1 or the push button ll can be released to return the relay 5 to the de energised state and cut off the supply of the motor Ml The same window may be lowered by operation of the push button 2 or the push button 12 so as to energise the relay 6.As a result of the energisation of the relay 6, the relay 5 being de energised, the motor M1 is connected to the electrical system of the car and is rotated.The polarity of the connection is however reversed with respect to that which can be obtained when the relay 5 is energised. The motor M1 thus rotates in the opposite direction, lowering the window associated with it.Naturally, the relays 5, 6,and the motor controlled thereby , may have associated sensors not illustrated for causing the deactivation of the motor itself when the windows reach their upper and lower travel limit positions.The connection arrangement described is such that the accidental operation of a raising push button for example the push button l and a lowering push button for example the push button 2 or the push buton 12 acting on the same motor M energises both relays 5 and 6.Both the supply terminals of the motor are thus connected to the positive pole P of the electrical system. The motor is therefore not activated, avoiding accidental overloads and damage to its windings.The connection arrangement of the push buttons 3, 4,13 and 14 to the relays 7 and 8 is exactly the same as the connection arrangement of the push buttons 1, 2, 11 and 12 to the relays 5 and 6.In paticular, the push button 3 and the push button 13 allow the relay 7 to be energised in orderato cause the raising of the glass of the front right hand window of the car. The push buttons 4 and 14 act instead on the relay 8 and allow lowering of this window.Again, in this case, the simultaneous operation of a raising push button and a lowering push button causes the energisation of both the relays 7 and 8 and the consequent deactivation of the motor M2.Naturally, the scope of the present invention arso extends to models which allow equal utility to be achieved with the use of the same innovative concept, and particularly to models in which the relays 5, 6, 7 and 8 described above are replaced by functionally equivalent circuit elements such as electronic semi conductor relays.
