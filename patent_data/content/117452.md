## Description
AQUEOUS PRINTING INKBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The invention relates to printing ink and more particularly to an aqueous printing ink vehicle and ink using a sulfated fatty acid component as a pigment binder.Brief Description of the Prior Art Conventional, commercially available printing inks, particularly useful for newsprinting, are generally made up of petroleum oils in which a pigment preferably carbon black is suspended. When applied to a paper substrate the oil separates from the pigment and is absbrbed into the paper substrate. The pigment is left deposited on the paper surface, but undried . In this untried state, off setting may occur, i.e. the ink is readily removed by rubbing the undried deposit. There are a number of other disadvantages associated with the use of oil based printing inks, including strike through , the phenomena caused by penetration of the oil component through the paper substrate so as to stain the reverse side. Many of these prior art problems associated with the use of oil based printing inks have been solved by the use of water based printing inks see for example U. S.Patent 4,310,356. The present invention is of water based printing ink that is useful as a newsprint ink and also for printing on any porous surface such as cellulosic bags, boxes and the like. The ink of the invention is unique in that it includes as an active ingredient, a water dispersible, sulfated organic binder based on a renewable resource and a co binder useful for viscosity control. The inks of the invention are advantageous in that they are relatively ro7 olluting, may be applied by the flexographic technique avoiding the energy inefficient letterpress technique , avoid strike through and are rubresistant because they dry or bind on the substrate surface. The quality of printing achievable is high.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention comprises a printing ink vehicle, which comprises a. a sulfated or sulfonated panic binder b. a viscosity adjusting agent c, a defoamer d. a pH adjusting agent and e. water said vehicle having a viscosity within the range of frOw√Öa about 1,000 to about 8,000 centipoise Brookfield viscosity at 25 C and a pH within the range of from about 5 to about 12. The invention also comprises printing inks made with the ink vehicle of the invention. The printing inks of this invention are prepared by dispersing a suitable pigment in the aforementioned vehicle by methods well known in the art, said ink having a viscosity range of from about 15 to about 80 seconds on a number 2 Zahn cup. The printing inks of this invention are particularly useful in printing newspapers, kraft paper, liner board and similar absorbent substrates.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERREDEMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The invention revolves around the discovery that sulfated or sulfonated organic compounds are excellent binder components for aqueous printing ink compositions. A wide variety of sulfated or sulfonated organic compounds may be employed as an active ingredient binder in the vehicles and the inks of the invention.Representative of such binders are Sulfated Castor Oils Alkylaryl SulfonatesAlcohol Ether Sulfates Napthalene SulfonatesFatty Ester Sulfates Sulfo SuccinatesEthoxylated Alkyl Phenol Sulfates Ligno SulfonatesAlkyl Sulfates Olefin SulfonatesSulfated Fatty Amides Fatty Amide SulfonatesAromatic Sulfonates Ethoxylated Alkyl Phenol Sulfonates and the like. Preferred as the sulfated or sulfonated organic compound employed in the invention are the sulfated or sulfonated fatty acids. The term fatty acids as used herein means the large group of aliphatic, monocarboxylic acids including the saturated acids of the acetic acid series CnH2n lCOOH, both normal and branched chain and the corresponding unsaturated acids. A complete definition and examples of fatty acids may be found in the Kirk OthmerEncyclopedia of Chemistry, Vol. 8, page 811. The sulfated or sulfonated fatty acids employed in the present invention may be prepared by the following schemes Sulfation Fatty Acid Sulfuric Acid EMI3.1 Sulfonation Fatty Acid Sulfur Trioxide EMI3.2 herein R represents the aliphatic residue of the fatty acid, after removal of the CH CH CH nCOOH or CH2 COOH moiety. Particularly preferred as the binder component of the printing ink composition of the present invention are the sulfated tall oil fatty acids. Crude tall oil generally contains from about 54 36 percent fatty acids in admixture with 38 to 58 percent rosin acids and 5 to 15 percent unsaponifiables. The sulfated crude oil m turves may be used in the vehicle and the inks of the invention.Advantageously however, refined tall oils are used, containing a minimum of at least 90 percent fatty acids to prepare the sulfate used in the compositions of the invention. Particularly preferred as a refined tall oil atty acid to prepare the sulfate used in the compositions of the invention is Unitol DSR Union Camp Corporation which nas the following typical composition. Weight Percent palmitic and stearic acids 4.6 oleic acid 40.3 linoleic acid 34.5 miscellaneous acids 11.5 rosin acids 3.0 8.0 unsaponifiables 3.0 The following preparation describes a process for making a preferred sulfated tall oil fatty acid used in the compositions of this invention.PREPARATION Twelve hundred sixty pounds of Unitol DSR Union CampCorporation was charged to a 500 gallon lead lined reactor equipped with three sets of angled paddles, fume removal system, and lead heating cooling coils. Agitation was begun and the Unitol DSR precooled to 100C. Three hundred seventy eight pounds of 98 sulfuric acid was added over a two hour period under full reactor cooling glycol and the temperature rose to 230C. The reaction mix was cooled to 100C for neutralization. Twelve hundred sixty pounds of 17 sodium hydroxide was added over a one half hour period.This gave a pH 5.1 with the reaction temperature climbing to 420C. Fifty pounds of sodium sulfate and 100 pounds of isopropyl alcohol were added to facilitate oil water phase separation. The mixture was left to split for eight hours.The oil phase was collected as product with the following pH 5.1 solids 66.0 hydrolyzable sulfate 5.3 Examples of other commercially available sulfated tall oil fatty acids are Actrasol SP Southland Corp. and ChemosL 22 Chemos Chemical Corp. . The preferred sulfated fatty acids employed as binders in the vehicle and ink compositions of the invention generally contain from three to ten percent hydrolyzable sulfate and preferably five to seven percent. The sulfa ed fatty acid binders are advantageously used in a proportion OL from 20 to 80 percent and preferably 50 to 70 percent of the total ink vehicle composition. In addition to the sulfated or sulfonated fatty acid binder component, the compositions of the invention also contain a viscosity adjusting agent, which is also functionally a co binder. While protein extracted from soybeans is preferred as a co binder and viscosity adjusting modifier, numerous other natural and synthetic water dispersible polymeric substances can be used.Representative of these are natural compounds such as cellulose derivatives HEC, CMC , starches, non soya proteins, gums, shellac, alginates, pections synthetic compounds such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylamide, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly alkylene oxides , alcohol soluble rosin maleics, styrene maleic resin, polyacrylic acid, acrylic copolymers and the like. The viscosity adjusting agent is used in a proportion adequate to obtain the desired viscosity of the composition of the invention. Advantageously, a defoamer is an ingredient of the compositions of the invention. Any conventional defoamer may be employed, in a defoaming proportion. Defoamers are well known and many are commercially available such as WITCO 3056A WITCO Chemical Co. . The compositions of the invention advantageously have a pH of from eight to nine. The desired pR may be obtained, when necessary, by adJustment with an acid or a base. In general, the compositions of the invention would tend to be acid without the addition of a strong base such as ammonium hydroxide to adjust to the desired pH. The vehicle compositions of the invention are pr ared by simple admixture of the ingredients therefore employing conventional apparatus and techniques for mixing aqueous materials. The following examples describe the manner and the process of making and using the invention and set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventors but are not to be construed as limiting. All parts are by weight unless otherwise stated.EXAMPLE I A suitable vessel was charged with 61.6 parts by weight of a sulfated tall oil fatty acid Unitol H 66 Union CampCorporation, Chemical Products Division, Jacksonville,Florida a sodium neutralized sulfated tall oil with a low rosin acid content and 26.9 parts of water. To the charge there was added with stirring 5.0 parts of an amine dispersible soya protein polymer 8000 Ralston PurinaCorp. . The mixture is heated to a temperature of circa 550C and with continued stirring there is added 6.0 parts of ammonium hydroxide. The temperature of the mixture is raised to circa 630C and stirring continued for about 30 minutes, after which there is added 0.5 parts of a defoamer Witco 3056A .After stirring for an additional 10 minutes, the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, filtered through cheesecloth and stored for use in a printing ink. The vehicle of Example 1 is used in admixture with a pigment to form an ink of the invention. Generally 10 to 50 percent by weight of the total ink composition comprises pigment. Any conventional pigment can be used.Representative of such pigments are carbon black, diarylide yellow, titanium dioxide, phthalocyanine blue cyan and calcium lithol red. The binder vehicle and pigment are suspended together in water as a carrier. Generally, a viscosity adjuster as previously described is added in sufficient quantity to provide a printable viscosity in the printing ink composition of the invention, within a range of from about 10 to about 80 seconds on a number 2 Zahn cup and more preferably 20 to about 40 seconds. When formulating the ink compositionofthis invention the formulator may use small amounts of other modifiers well known in the art. Examples of these are microcrystalline and paraffin waxes, pigment extenders such as clays and pigment dispersing aids such as sodium hexametaphosphate or co solvents like glycols and other high boiling solvents to regulate ink film drying rates. In general, including all additives the ink composition of the invention will have solids contents ranging from 15 to about 80 percent by weight of the total composition preferably 30 to 60 percent to insure good color density and printability. The following example demonstrates the use of the preferred ink vehicle of Example 1 in preparation of several different color inks.
