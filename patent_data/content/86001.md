# Method for manufacturing a screen that obstructs the flow of subsoil water.

## Abstract
Method for manufacturing a screen that restricts or obstructs the flow of subsoil water in the ground by providing in the ground from the land level downwardly subsoil water retaining wall elements 1,2 11,12 17 that engage each other and are in the shape of wide more or less souple films or sheets 1,2 11,12 17 , that therefor with their lower edge are releasably connected to a flushing lance 19 that in essence is as wide as each film 1,2 11,12 17 and said lance 19 after insertion of the film 1,2 11,12 17 in the ground is released and retracted. The invention aims to provide a method with which it is possible to cause in a very simple manner a good seal and coupling of the films 1,2 11,12 17 adjoining each other.
