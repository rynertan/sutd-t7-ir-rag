## Abstract
A capstan 2 and a driving motor 5 are coupled by a belt 7 , the motor 5 is connected to a power supply circuit 11 through a switching circuit 8 . Voltage is supplied from the switching circuit 8 to the motor. The motor driving voltage application time T₁ by the switching circuit 8 is set to be an integer multiple of the reciprocal of the resonance frequency f₀ of the belt driving system.
