# RECLINE CHAIR

## Abstract
A recline chair for use in an office or home is designed, with associated furniture, for the performance of tasks while in such chair such as reading, writing or operation of a com puter or word processor. The chair is designed to be used with an ottoman and includes a seat 25 and back 20 both reclinable rearwardly with the back being reclinable to a much greater extent. The back and arms 18 are pivoted at an ideal natural body pivot point 17 of the user and the seat is pivoted 24 at its front but reclined through a suspended linkage 28, 29 from the arms but through a much shorter pivot arm so there is not upward lifting of the users legs. A head rest 44 is mounted on the back and is extendable about which is struck from the ideal pivot point of the head and back of the user. The head rest includes a special cranial support 131 which may be vertically adjusted within the headrest itself. Both the headrest and the seat and back are provided with separate actuators 69, 39 which tend to urge the headrest to its extended position and the seat and back to the upright position. Each actuator includes a locking mechanism and separate control means are provided for each lock mechanism in the respective arms. The lock mech anism of the head rest and backrest is engaged as a result of the weight of a user sitting in the chair and can only be re leased through its control. The controls are enabled as a result of the weight of the user in the chair. The chair is brought to its upright position automatically if the user should leave the chair in its reclined position. This is accomplished through a special interlocking control mechanism in each arm of the chair actuated by the presence or absence of a weight on the seat.
