# Calcining method and enclosure structure therefor.

## Abstract
Method for calcining carbonaceous blocks into car bonaceous bodies, in which either a continuous or intermit tent operation furnace is used. After placing carbonaceous blocks to be calcined onto the loading platform of a cart, a containment structure or enclosure structure is formed around the carbonaceous blocks including a barrier, which is held away from and is adapted to completely enclose the carbonaceous blocks, with the optional exception of barrier formed on the surface of the loading platform on which the carbonaceous blocks rest. The barrier being effective to prevent seepage of air or gases therethrough during cal cination. The containment or enclosure structure for imple menting the method comprises a conventional cart 4 for continuous and intermittent operation furnaces overlaid by a stacked arrangement including two side by side walls 6,6 of refractory material wherebetween a barrier 7 of carbonaceous powder is interposed, and a cover 8 , includ ing two slabs also formed from refractory material and arranged in two layers 18 wherebetween a further barrier of carbonaceous powder is provided. An additional barrier 5 of carbonaceous powder may be optionally provided on the loading platform 3 of the cart 4 .
