# THERMALLY CONDUCTIVE BASE LAYERS FOR CAST POLYURETHANE ROLL COVERS

## Abstract
A roll comprising a hollow metal core member, an inter mediate base layer or layers, and a polyurethane cover, the intermediate base layer compounded to have improved thermal conductivity. The intermediate base layer or layers having improved thermal conductivity function to dissipate heat gen erated by hysteresis deformation energy , thereby permitting the rolls to operate at higher roll speeds and higher pressures without roll failure.
