## Description
SOLAR HEAT COLLECTORBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to a solar heat collector for a hot water supply, solar heat air conditioning systems and the like.2. Description of the Prior Art Heretofore, there have been proposed various types of solar heat collectors for the hot water supply, solar heat air conditioning systems and the like. Fig. 1 is an explanatory view illustrating a solar heat collector 1 of the prior art. This solar heat collector 1 comprises absorber plate 2 for converting the solar rays into thermal energy to transmit the thermal energy to a heat transfer medium such as water a heat transfer medium flow path 3 formed in the absorber plate 2 a transparent sheet 4 made of glass or the like for preventing the convection heat loss through the absorber plate 2 and protecting the absorber plate 2 against the contamination and damages caused by the external factors a heat insulating material 5 for preventing the heat loss through the rear surface of the solar heat collector and an outer box 6 for protecting the absorber plate 2 and the insulating material 5, totally covering the solar heat collector in cooperation with the transparent sheet 4. The performance of the abovedescribed solar heat collector is determined by the extent of controlling the heat loss of the absorbed energy due to the convection, radiation and conduction. As the methods of suppressing the heat loss described above, heretofore, there have been adopted such methods that the surface of the absorber plate 2 is subjected to a selective absorption surface treatment for suppressing the radiation heat loss, a convection preventive structure such as a honeycomb transparent heat trap for suppressing the convection heat loss is provided between the absorber plate 2 and the transparent sheet 4, a vacuum heat insulating system for controlling the conduction heat loss and the convection heat loss is utilized, and so forth. Now, the abovedescribed conventional methods of suppressing the heat loss in the solar heat collectors have displayed effects in suppressing the heat losses to some extent, however, the three forms of heat losses due to the convection, radiation and conduction have such causal relations that, when one of these three losses is suppressed , the heat losses due to the remaining causes are accordingly increased, and, when two of these three heat losses are suppressed, the heat loss due to the remaining cause is accordingly increased. For example, in the solar heat collector 1 shown inFig. 1, when the surface of the absorber plate 2 is subjected to the selective absorption surface, the quantity of radiation heat from the absorber plate 2 to the transparent sheet 4 is decreased, however, with the result that the transparent sheet 4 is lowered in temperature, thus resulting in increased quantity of convection heat from the absorber plate to the transparent sheet 4. In the case of the conventional vacuum cylindrical solar heat collector 1A shown in Figs.2 A and 2 B , when the surface of the absorber plate 7 is formed into the selective absorption surface and a gap 9 for heat insulating disposed between the absorber plate 7 and a transparent cover 8 is vacuum insulated, the heat losses in two forms of the radiation and convection can be suppressed, however, the heat loss through a vacuum sealed portion 10 due to the conduction is increased to a great extent. Consequently, as described in the two examples shown above, the conventional methods of suppressing the heat loss in the solar heat collectors display the effects to some extent, however, present such a disadvantage that the heat losses of the three forms cannot be suppressed at the same time.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has been developed to obviate the abovedescribed disadvantage of the prior art and has as its object the provision of a solar heat collector at a high thermal efficiency, wherein the heat losses of the three forms can be simultaneously suppressed without attenuating the incident solar energy. To achieve the abovedescribed object, according to the present invention, in a solar heat collector having a absorber plate in a box member provided at the surface thereof with a transparent sheet, the surface of the absorber plate is subjected to a selective absorption surface treatment referred to as factor A hereinafter and a V shaped transmitting member factor D formed of an ethylene fluoride resin film factorC having a film thickness of 1 to 100 um factor B between the transparent sheet and the absorber plate.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The above mentioned features and objects of the present invention will become more apparently with reference to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals denote like elements and in which Fig. 1 is a sectional view showing the solar heat collector of the prior art Fig. 2 A is a sectional view showing an example of the vacuum cylindrical solar heat collector of the prior art Fig. 2 B is a sectional view taken along the line IIB IIB in Fig. 2 A Fig. 3 is a sectional view showing an embodiment of the solar heat collector according to the present invention Fig. 4 is a perspective view depicting a V shaped transparent heat trap in the embodiment shown in Fig. 3 Fig. 5 A is a sectional view showing the essential portions of Fig. 3 Fig. 5 B is a sectional view showing a honeycomb transparent heat trap of the prior art Fig. 6 is a sectional view showing the conditions of the heat transfer in Fig. 3 and Fig. 7 is a chart showing the characteristic curves of emissivity against the wavelengths.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Description will now be given of the embodiment of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig 3 is an explanatory view showing an embodiment of a solar heat collector 11 according to the present invention.The solar heat collector 11 comprises an absorber plate 12 for converting the solar rays into thermal energy to transmit the thermal energy to a heat transfer medium a heat transfer medium flow path 13 a transparent sheet 14 for preventing the convection heat loss through the absorber plate 12 and protecting the absorber plate 12 against the contamination and damages caused by the external factors a heat insulating material 15 for preventing the heat loss through the rear surface of the solar heat collector and an outer box 16 for totally covering the solar heat collector The absorber plate 12 is formed in a manner to connect a plurality of tubes being flat in cross section to a flat sheet and applied to the surface thereof with a selective absorption surface treatment.This absorber plate 12 may be formed of two corrugated sheets.A transparent heat trap 17 formed of an ethylene fluoride resin film having a film thickness of l to 100 pm and being formed into continuous V shapes in cross section as shown inFig. 4 is provided between the absorber plate 12 and the transparent sheet 14. This transparent heat trap 17 is formed into continuous V shapes in cross section at a substantially regular pitch and extends across the absorber plate. The provision of the transparent heat trap 17 partitions a gap formed between the absorber plate 12 and the transparent sheet 14 into a plurality of small chambers. Constituent materials suitable for the ethylene fluoride resin film include a copolymer FEP obtained from 4 ethylene fluoride and 6 propylene fluoride, a copolymer PFA obtained from 4 ethylene fluoride and perfluoroalkylvinylether, and a copolymer EFE obtained from 4 ethylene fluoride and ethylene. Description will hereunder be given of the heat collecting characteristics of the solar heater collector in the abovedescribed embodiment in conjunction with actions of the respective factor A through D. The factor A subjecting the surface of the absorber plate. 12 to the selective absorption surface treatment suppresses the radiation heat loss through the absorber plate 12 as has been proposed heretofore. The factor B using a thin film having a film thickness of 1 to 100 pm as the V shaped transparent heat trap 17 improves the transmittance so as not to attenuate the solar energy, and moreover, secures the effects of suppressing the radiation heat loss caused by the factor A because the factorB has a low emissivity for the infrared rays as will be described hereinafter. The factor C using an ethylene fluoride resin film as the constituent material of the V shaped transparent heat trap 17 improves the productivity and the durability, both of which are required for the transparent heat trap. In other words, in order to secure the effects of suppressing the radiation heat loss caused by the factor A when the transparent heat trap made of glass is used, it is necessary to decrease the thickness of the glass to as thin as about a few pm, which may result in difficulties in the production. Furthermore, when the transparent heat trap made of common transparent plastics such as polycarbonate, acryl, vinyl fluoride or the like is used, it becomes impossible to secure the heat resistance required for the solar heat collector, in which the ultimate temperature of stagnation reaches a temperature as high as 2000 to 2500C. The factor D forming the transparent heat trap 17 into continuous V shapes in cross section can restrict the decrease in the transmittance to suppress the convection heat loss, and moreover, makes it possible to decrease the contact area of the transparent heat trap with the transparent sheet or the absorber plate, thereby enabling to suppress the conduction heat loss. In comparison in action between the transparent heat trap 17 according to the present invention and the conventional honeycomb transparent heat trap used for preventing the convection heat loss, the number of the chambers 1A to 7A partitioned by the V shaped transparent heat trap 17 being formed at a substantially regular pitch so as not to decrease the transmittance for the solar energy is larger than the number of the chambers 1B to 43 partitioned by the conventional honeycomb transparent heat trap 17A, so that the effects for suppressing the convection can be improved.by the transparent heat trap 17 according to the present invention. Further, in the V shaped transparent heat trap 17, a reflected light Q of an incident light P in the transparent heat trap is constantly directed to the absorber plate 12 in the same manner as in the honeycomb transparent heat trap, so that the former has a transmitting performance equal on level to that of the latter. Further, the honeycomb transparent heat trap 17A should necessarily be produced by a method of adhesive bonding, whereas the V shaped transparent heat trap 17 made of ethylene fluoride resin may be produced by a production method suitable for a mass production such as a vacuum forming method When both the factor A subjecting the surface of the absorber plate 12 to the selective absorption surface and the factor B setting the film thickness of the V shaped transparent heat trap 17 to 1 to 100 pm are applied, the effects of suppressing the radiation heat loss caused by the factor A is secured by the factor B decreasing the emissivity for the infrared rays. More specifically, Fig. 6 shows the distribution of temperature in the V shaped transparent heat trap 17 when an ambient temperature is 20 C, the temperature of the absorber plate is 1000C and the temperature of the transparent sheet 12 is 300C. Under the abovedescribed condition, a heat conduction takes place from the absorber plate 12 to the transparent sheet 14 and small convection M Each of these convections M has little capacity of transferring the heat as compared with the case where no V shaped transparent heat trap 17 is provided .are generated in the chambers partitioned by the V shaped transparent heat trap 17. Then, when the V shaped transparent heat trap 17 has a high emissivity, a heat radiation indicated by arrows N takes place towards the transparent sheet 14 from the surface of the V shaped transparent heat trap 17. In order to control the heat radiation N from the V shaped transparent heat trap 17, it is necessary to use a substance having a low emissivity for the infrared rays, i.e. emitting little heat radiation as the V shaped transparent heat trap 17. TheV shaped transparent heat trap 17 formed of a ethylene fluoride resin film having a film thickness of 1 tq 100 um has a low emissivity for the infrared rays as shown in Fig. 7. More specifically, referring to Fig. 7 showing the relationships between the wavelengths and the monocolour emissivity of a glass L1 having a thickness of 1 mm, an ethylene fluoride resin FEP film L2 having a film thickness of 1 mm, an ethylene fluoride resin FEP film L3 having a film thickness of 100 pm and an ethylene fluoride resin FEP film L4 having a film thickness of I um, it is observed that the ethylene fluoride resin film L3 or L4 having a film thickness as thin as 1 to 100 ijm qualitatively tends to have a low emissivity for the infrared rays. In the conventional solar heat collectors, transparent members having a high emissivity for the infrared rays are used as the transparent heat trap to improve the thermal efficiency through the green house effects, however, such transparent heat trap are effectual only when the surfaces of the absorber plates are of nonselective absorption surfaces and, when the surfaces of the absorber plates are subjected to a selective absorption surface, it is effectual only when ethylene fluoride resin films having a thickness of 1 to 100 um as described above are used. In consequence, the abovedescribed embodiment makes it possible to suppress the three forms of heat losses at the same time, and moreover, not to attenuate the incident solar energy. In other words, when the factors B, C and D are applied, the incident solar energy is not attenuated, the factors A, B and C are combined to suppress the radiation heat loss satisfactorily, the factors C and D adopt the use of plastics being low in the thermal conductivity and decrease the contact area of the transparent heat trap with the transparent sheet or the absorber plate so as to suppress the conduction heat loss, and the factor D can suppress the convection heat loss to an extent lower than that in the transparent heat trap being of a honeycomb structure of the prior art. Namely, the combined effects of these factors A through D lead to that three forms of heat losses due to convection, radiation and conduction can be suppressed at the same time to obtain a high heat collecting efficiency. As has been described hereinabove, according to the present invention, in the solar heat collector, wherein an absorber plate is mounted in a box member provided on the surface thereof with a transparent sheet, the surface of the absorber plate is subjected to the selective absorption surface treatment, and the V shaped transparent heat trap formed of the ethylene fluoride resin film having a film thickness of 1 to 100 pm is provided between the transparent sheet and the absorber plate, whereby the three forms of heat losses due to convection, radiation and conduction are suppressed at the same time, so that a high heat collecting efficiency can be achieved.
