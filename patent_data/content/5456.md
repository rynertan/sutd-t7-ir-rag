# Method of forming and filling a container, means for applying the method and a container produced in accordance with the method.

## Abstract
Containers 20A such as those used for foodstuffs having a generally frusto conical initial shape are constrained into a forming die during the handling of the containers for injecting quantities of edibles and the like therein such that the containers 20A are constrained to enter a die having a generally square configuration and then, while still in the die, the containers 20A are filled with food or other material and a square lid 50 is fed into position above the filled container and placed thereon to maintain the square configuration of the upper end thereof. The resulting containers provide a much more efficient packaging for equal volumes of product when compared with the more conventional frusto conical shape containers. The invention is particularly well adapted to packaging ice cream and the like.
