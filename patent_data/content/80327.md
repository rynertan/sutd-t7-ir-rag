# Engine installation having exhaust gas recirculation system.

## Abstract
A stationary engine installation comprises a gas engine 10 having a carburetor 12 and an exhaust pipe 18 supplying exhaust gas to a turbocharger 22 . Combustion air is supplied to the carburetor via an air conduit 30 , cooler 32 , conduit 36 , orifice 38 and venturi 40 . An air supply conduit 50 incorporating a normally closed valve 54 connects the air conduit 30 to the exhaust pipe 18 whilst an exhaust conduit 42, 48 incorporating a cooler 44 and a normally closed valve 52 connects the exhaust pipe 18 to the venturi to recirculate exhaust gas from the exhaust pipe to the carburetor. The normally closed valves 52, 54 are opened when pressure in air conduit 36 exceeds a predetermined value so that the valves 52, 54 are both closed during start up and idle conditions. When opened the valves 52, 54 allow recirculation of exhaust gases to reduce nitrogen oxides in the finally exhausted gas without the use of pumps or blowers.
