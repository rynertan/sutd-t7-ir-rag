# An envelope generator in an electronic musical instrument.

## Abstract
An envelope generator 20 used in an electronic musical instrument, such as an electronic organ, includes dual charge pumps to form the attack and decay portions of the envelope. The envelope generator is arranged to be con nected to the envelope control input of a keyer 32 and the other input of the keyer is connected to a tone source 34 . When the appropriate key of the keyboard 10 is depressed, a source of input voltage is connected to the input of the envelope generator 20 and a first charge pump 54 incrementally transfers the input voltage to a capacitor 74 over a first sequence of discrete time frames. A second charge pump 156 connected serially between the first charge pump and the envelope input of the keyer incremen tally transfers the voltage on the capacitor 74 to another capacitor 106 over a second sequence of discrete time frames. This arrangement has the effect of reducing the magnitude of the discrete steps thereby avoiding audible distortion associated with prior envelope generators includ ing only a single charge pump. The second charge pump may be a dual phase 130 charge pump so that the effective frequency ratio between the second and first charge pumps is doubled.
