This invention also relates to the discovery that certain known antibiotics can be used as immunomobulators. New, improved antibiotics are continually in demand. Better antibiotics are needed for treating human diseases, and improved antibiotics are also needed in the veterinary field. Increased potency, expanded spectrum of bacterial inhibition, increased in vivo efficacy, and improved pharmaceutical properties such as greater cr l absorption, higher blood or tissue concentrations, longer body half life, and more advantageous rate cr rout of excretion and rate or pattern of metabolism are some of the goals for 1. proved antibiotiOs. The body s defense system the immune system is exceedingly complex, and understanding its mechanisms is.an important goal. Although knowledge in this area has expanded at a rapid rat in the past decade, there is much to learn. Macrophages play an important role in the immune system. These cells are both phagocytic they can engulf and kill microbial cells and secretory they release chemical signals which diffuse throughout the body . Macrophages are able to carry or at least are able to make more than 50 destructive cr instructive secretory products, and are sometimes able to destroy tumor cells completely. Ths, immunomodulating agents which act by activating macrochage cells are suit valuable. The state of the art for immunomodulators is shown by H. Umegawa, Recent Studies on Antibiotics and Small Molecular Immunomodulators with Potential Usefulness in Treating Lung Cancer Part II Small MolecularWeight Immunomodulators Produced by Microorganisms, Inter. J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. and Toxicol. 20 1 , l9 23 1982 . U.S. Patent No. 4,331,591 discloses a chemical process for the preparation of peptide derivatives of certain a aminophosphonic acids.

The compounds of this invention can be shown by formula 2b which is EMI7.2 wherein LAPP is formula 4 above RÚ represents the characterizing group of an alpha amino acid of the type normally found in proteins Z is hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl, Cl C6 alkanoyl, phenyl C1 C3 alkyl, phenyl X m C1 C3 alkanoyl, or an amino protecting group Z is hydrogen or C1 C6 alkyl X is oxygen or sulfur m is 0 or 1 and n is 0, 1, 2 or 3 and the salts thereof. The term the characterizing group of an amino acid of the type normally found in proteins refers to the residue RI in a natural alpha amino acid of the general formulaEMI8.1 which is of the type normally occurring in proteins.Examples of such amino acids and the corresponding RÚ groups are alanine RÚ methyl leucine RÚ isobutyl glutamic acid R1 2 carboxyethyl . In addition, R can represent a residue linked to the amino nitrogen with the concomitant loss of one of the hydrogen atoms attached to the nitrogen , thus forming a nitrogen containing ring such as occurs in proline. The terms Cl c6 alkyl and C1 C3 alkyl as used herein mean a straight or branched chain alkyl group containing from one to six or one to three carbon atoms, respectively Such groups include methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n butyl, sec butyl, isobutyl, tertbutyl, n pentyl, isopentyl, and the like. The term Cl C6 alkanoyl as used herein means an acyl moiety derived from a carboxylic acid containing from one to six carbon atoms. In such a moiety, the alkyl group can be straight, branched, or cyclic. Acetyl, propionyl, n butyryl, isobutyryl, n valeryl, and isovaleryl are examples of such groups. The terms phenyl C1 C3 alkyl and phenyl X C c alkanoyl refer to groups such as benzyl, phenethyl, benzoyl, phenylacetyl, phenylpropionyl, phenoxyacetyl and phenylthioacetyl. The term amino protecting group is known to those in the art. Examples of suitableprotecting groups can be found in Protective Groups in OrganicSynthesis by Theodora W. Greene, John wily and Sons,New York, 1981, Chapter 7. Antibiotic A53868 factor A is a member of an antibiotic complex which comprises more than one factor. The A53868 complex contains major factor A and other as yet uncharacterized factors. The term complex as used in the fermentation art and in this specification refers to a mixture of co produced individual antibiotic factors. As will be recognized by those familar with antibiotic production by fermentation, the number and ratio of individual factors produced in an antibiotic complex will vary, depending upon the fermentation conditions used.In the A53868 complex, factor A is the major factor. The following paragraphs describe the properties of A53S68 factor A. A53868 factor A is a colorless amorphous material having an empirical formula of C11H22N3 OP and a molecular weight of about 307. Elemental analy sis of A53868 factor A indicates that it has the following approximate percentage comppsition Calculated for Found C11H21N3O5PNa Sample I Sample II Carbon 41.32 38.74 40.12Hydrogen 7.61 6.78 6.43Nitrogen 11.53 12.42 12,76 Oxygen 24.38 24.30 Phosphorus 7.70 9.41Ash 13.58 Ash was shown to be phosphate Mass spectrometry of A53868 factor A, run in the fast atom bombardment mode, gave the following results Elemental m Z HRMS Composition M H 308 308.13818 C1lH23N305P 143 143.11878 C7H15N2O 138 138.03240 C3H9NO3P Molecular weight 307 Molecular formula C11H22N3O5P The infrared absorpticn. spectrum of A53868 factor A free acid in KBr pellet is shown in the accompanying drawing.Significant absorption maxima occur at the following frequencies cm 1 3368, 3312 and 3300 broad, strong , 3063 weak , 2966 medium to weak , 2833 very wead , 2663 weak , 1671 strong , 1625 shoulder , 1536 strong , 1469 weak , 1442 weak , 1386 medium to weak , 1340 very weak , 1277 very weak , 1240 shoulder , 1207 strong , 1157 very weak , 1063 medium , 1048 strong , 918 medium to weak , 797 medium , 778 medium , and 625 weak . Amino acid analyses on samples of A53868 factor A hydrolyzed with 6N HCl gave the following results Average Amino Acid . loles mg Found Theoretical . Purity glycine 2.8 3.2 87 leucine 2.86 3.2 87 Electrometric titration of A53868 factor A in 66 aqueous dimethylformamide indicated the presence of a titratable group with a PKa value of 8.2 the glycol amino group . A53868 factor A is soluble in water and dimethyl sulfoxide and is insoluble in most organic solvents. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry ofA53868 factor A, using a 360 MHz instrument with the sample dissolved in DMSO d6, indicated that A53868 factor A has the structure shown in formula 1 above. The formulae 1 and 2 compounds are capable of forming salts which are also part of this invention. It will be appreciated that the formulae 1 and 2 compounds have both an acid function which can form salts and an amino group which can form acid addition salts.Such salts are useful, for example, for separating and purifying the antibiotics. In addition, pharmaceutically acceptable salts are especially useful. Pharmaceutically acceptable alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and amine salts and acid addition salts are particularly useful. Representative and suitable alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts include the sodium, potassium, lithium, cesium, rubidium, barium, calcium and magnesium salts. Suitable amine salts include the ammonium and the primary, secondary, and tertiary Cl C4 alkylammonium and hy droxy C2 C4 alkyla nonium salts Illustrative amine salts include those formed by reaction of a formula 2 compound with ammonium hydroxide, methylamine, secbutylamine, isopropylamine, diethylamine, cyclohexylamine, di isopropylamine, cy clohexylamine, ethanolamine, triethylamine, 3 amino lrpropanol, and the like. The alkali metal and alkaline earth metal cationic salts are prepared according to procedures commonly used for the preparation of cationic salts.For example, an appropriate formula 2 compound is dissolved in a suitable solvent such as water a solution containing the stoichiometric quantity of the desired inorganic base is added to this solution, using care to prevent the pH of the solution from becoming too basic. The salt thus formed can be isolated by routine methods, such as filtration or evaporation of the solvent. Alternatively, the formula 2 compound in solution can be passed over an appropriate ionexchange resin. The salts formed with organic amines can be prepared in a similar manner. For example, the gaseous or liquid amine can be added to a solution of an appropriate formula 2 compound in a suitable solvent such as water the solvent and excess amine can be removed by evaporation. Representative and suitable acid addition salts include those salts formed by standard reaction with both organic and inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, succinic, citric, lactic, maleic, fumaric, palmitic, cholic, pamoic, mucic, D glutamic, d camphoric, glutaric, glycolic, phthalic, tartaric, lauric,. stearic, salicylic, mathanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, sorbic, picric, benzoic, cinnamic, and like acids. The novel antibiotic of formula 1 is produced by culturing an A53868 factor A producing strain ofStreptomyces luridus under submerged aerobic conditions in a suitable culture medium until substantial antibiotic activity is produced. The antibiotic is recovered by the use of various isolation and purification procedures recognized in the fermentation art. The new organism useful for the preparation of A53868 factor A was isolated from a soil sample collected from Granik Rapids at the bottom of the GrandCanyon in Arizona. This organism, called cultureA53868, is classified as a strain of StreotQmyces luridus. This classification is based on a comparison with published descriptions of this species R. E. Buchanan and N.

When present, they are short, tight and compact. Sporophore morphology is placed in the section Retinaculiaperti RA of Pridham, et al., supra. This morphology is best observed on ISP No. 4 and Czapek T S solution agar. Mature spore chains generally contain about 10 spores per chain. The spore shape is spherical to oblong, but is mainly oblong.The spore size was determined with an optical light microscope, using a Vickers Image Splitting MeasuringEyepiece. The spore size ranges from 0.93 1.85 uM in length and 0.62 1.30 pM in width. The average size is 1.28 VM x 0.94 VM. The spore surface ornamentation is smooth.Physiological Characteristics Analysis of hydrolyzed whole cells demonstrated the presence of LL DAP diaminopimelic acid with no meso isomer present. Sugar analysis of hydrolyzed whole cells demonstrated the presence of glucose, mannose and ribose. This represents a Type I cell wall and an NC, or no characteristic, sugar pattern see Bergey s Manual , supra . This combination of major cell wall constituents is indicative of the genusStreptomyces. The carbon utilization pattern for A53868 is as follows L arabinose, D glucose, cellobiose,D fructose, D galactose, i inositol, lactose, Dmaltose, D ribose, salicin, sodium acetate, sodium citrate, sodium succinate, and D xylose are all utilized for growth. D arabinose, melibiose, Dmannitol, D raffinose, L rhamnose, and sucrose do not support growth. Culture A53868 will liquefy gelatin and hydrolyze starch. It does not reduce nitrate. Skim milk is neither hydrolyzed nor peptonized by the culture. Culture A53868 will tolerate up to 7 percent NaCI and will grow at temperatures between 10 370C. Melanoid pigments are produced by A53868 when grown in tryptone yeast extract broth ISP No.. 1 , and on slants of peotone yeast extract iron agar ISPNo. 6 and tyrosine agar ISP No. 7 .Species Determination The cultural, morphological and physiological characteristics of A53868 were compared with published descriptions of similar species. Fourteen Streptomyces species had close reseiblance to culture A53868 and were, therefore, studied in detail. Two species were selected as being the most similar to A53868. These two cultures are Streptomyces lavendofoliae E.B. Shirling, et al., supra, p. 339 Streptomyces luridus E.B. Shirling, et al., supra, p. 142 These two cultures are reported in the literature as belonging in the red R color series with retinaculiaperti RA sporophore morphology, smooth Sm spore surface ornamentation, producing melanoid pigments and having a carbon utilization pattern and other characteristics quite similar toA53868.They are both recognized in the Approved List of Bacterial Names V.B.D. Skerman et al., Intern.Journal of Systematic Bacteriol. 30 1 , 225 420 lug80 1. Further comparison of culture A53868 with these two cultures shows S. lavendofoliae This cultur has many characteristics in common with A53868 and, although the differences are few, they are more than those withS. luridus. The general morphology, pigmentation, lack of soluble pigments, production of melanoid pigment, spore mass color, spore surface ornamentation and carbon utilization are all similar to A53868. S.lavendofoliae differs from A53868 in having a ionger spore chain, more spiral sporophores, lack of fructose utilization, and poorer growth on Czapek s solution agar. S. luridus This culture is similar culturally, morphologically and physiologically to A53868.Both cultures are in the Red R color series, lack distinctive pigments, have the same RA sporophore morphology with smooth spore surface, produce melanoid pigments, and have a similar carbon utilization pattern.The similarities and differences between A53868 and S. luridus are summarized in Table II.

This classification was based on a comparisqn with published descriptions and not on direct laboratory comparisons. The Streptomyces luridus culture useful for the production of A53868 factor A has been deposited and made a part of the stock culture collection of theNorthern Regional Research Center, U.S. Department ofAgriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Peoria,Illinois, 61604, from which it is available to the public under the number NRRL 15101, date of deposit July 14 2 As is the case with other organisms, the characteristics of the A53868 factor A producing culture, Streptomyces luridus NRRL 15101, are subject to variation. For example, variants, recombinants, and mutants of the NRRL 15101 strain may be obtained by treatment with various known mutagens such as ultraviolet rays, X rays, high fresuency waves, radioactive rays and chemicals.All natural and induced variants, mutants and recombinants of Streptomyces luridus NRRL 15101 which produce A53868 factor A may be used. The culture medium used to grow Streptomyces luridus NRRL 15101 can be any one of a number of media. For economy in production, optimal yield, and ease of product isolation, however, certain culture media are preferred.. Thus, for example, a preferred carbon source in large scale fermentation is soluble starch, although glucose, starch, dextrin, glycerol, and the like can also be used. A preferred nitrogen source is pancreatic digest of casein, although enzyme hydrolyzed casein, enzymatic digest of soy meal, acidhydrolyzed casein, and the like are also useful.Glycine and leucine enrichment of the medium may also be beneficial. Nutrient inorganic salts which can be incorporated in the culture media are the soluble salts capable of yielding calcium potassium, ammonium, chloride, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, and like ions. Essential trace elements necessary for the growth and development of the organism should also be included in the culture medium. Such trace elements commonly occur as impurities in other constituents of the medium in amounts sufficient to meet the growth requirements of the organism. It may be necessary to add small amounts e.g., 0.2 ml L of an antifoam agent such as polyprdpylene glycol to large scale fermentation media if foaming becomes a problem. For production of substantial quantities ofA53868 factor A, submerged aerobic fernentation in tanks is preferred. Small quantities of A53868 factor A may be obtained by shake flask culture. Because of the time lag in antibiotic production commonly associated with inoculation of large tanks with the spore form of the organism, it is preferable to use a vegetative inoculum. The vegetative inoculum is prepared by inoculating a small volume of culture medium with the spore form or mycelial fragments of the organism to obtain a fresh, actively growing culture of the organism. The vegetative inoculum is then transferred to a larger tank. The A53868 factor A producing organism can be grown at temperatures between about 100 and about 370C.Optimum A53868 factor A production appears to occur at temperatures of about 280 300C. As is customary in aerobic submerged culture processes, sterile air is dispersed through the culture medium. For efficient production of A53868 factor A, the dissolved oxygen level should be maintained above 30 of air saturation at 30or. and atmospheric pressure . For. tank fermentation, it is preferable to maintain the pH level of the fermentation medium in a range of from about 6.5 7.4. This can be done by the addition of appropriate amounts of, for example, sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. Production of A53868 factor A can be followed during the fermentation by testing samples of the broth or df extracts of the mycelial solids for antibiotic activity against organisms known to be sensitive to the antibiotic. One assay organism useful in testing this antibiotic is Micrococcus luteus. The bioassay is preferably performed by paper disc assay on agar plates. Following its production under submerged aerobic fermentation conditions, A53868 factor A can be recovered from the fermentation medium by methods recognized in the fermentation art. The antibiotic activity produced during fermentation of an A53868 Eactor A producing organism generally occurs in the broth. Maximum recovery of A53868 factor A is accomplished, therefore, by an initial filtration to remove the mycelial mass. The filtered broth can be purified by a variety of techniques to give the A53868 complex. A preferred method involves adsorption on a carbon column, eluting to give the A53868 complex. Further purification and separation of theA53868 complex to give the individual A53868 factor A includes additional adsorption and extraction procedures. Useful adsorptive materials for the purification of the A53868 complex and A53868 factor A include 1 high porous polymer Diaion HP 20 2 Sephadex A25 and G 50 Bio Gel P 2 and P 10 3 Anionexchange resins a strongly basic polystyrene,BioRad AG 1 2, Bio Rex, Dowex 1 and 2, Amberlite IRA 400, 401, 410 b moderately basic epoxypolyamine BioRex 5, and Duolite A3OB c weakly basic polystyrene or phenolic polyamine Bio Rad AG3, Duolite A 6, A 7,Amberlite IRA 68, IR 45, IR 4B 4 silica gel 5 florisil 6 polymeric adsorbents XAD 2 and 4 7 reversed phase resins, silica gel C18 and silica gel C8 8 carbon 9 DEAE cellulose, DEAE Sephadex 10 polyamide 11 alumina and 12 microcellulose.Sources Bio Rad and Bio Gel resins Bio Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA Amberlite and XAD resins Rohm and Haas Co, Philadelphia, PA Duolite resins Diamond Shamrock Chemical Co, Redwood City, CA Sephadex resins Pharmacia Fine Chemicals AB, Uppsala,Sweden Dowex resins Dow Chemical Co., Midland, MI Diaion Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Ltd., Tokyo,Japan XAD resins, silica gel C18 and silica gel C8 E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany. The formula 2a compounds are prepared from compound 1 by routine methods for peptide synthesis. The methods involve the coupling of amino acids or peptide fragments by reaction of the carboxyl function of one with the amino function cf another to produce an amide linkage. In order to achieve coupling effectively, it is desirable 1 that all reactive functionalities not participating directly in. the reaction be inactivated by the use of appropriate blocking groups and 2 that the carboxyl function which is to be coupled be appropriately activated to permit coupling to proceed.All of this involves a careful selection of both reaction sequence and reaction conditions as well as utilization of specific blocking groups so that the desired peptide product will be realized. Each of the amino acids which is used to produce the compounds of this invention and which has the particularly selected protecting groups and or activating functionalities is prepared by using techniques recognized in the peptide art. Selected combinations of blocking groups are used at each point of the synthesis of the compounds of formula 2a These particular combinations have been found to function most smoothly. Other combinations would operate in the synthesis of the compounds of formula 2a, although, perhaps, with a lesser degree of success.Thus, for example, benzyloxycarbonyl CBz , t butyloxycarbonyl BOC , t amyloxycarbonyl AOC , p methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl MBOC , adamantyloxycarbonyl AdOC , and isobornyloxycarbonyl can be used 2s aminoblocking groups in the synthesis of the compounds of formula 2a, Benzyl Bzl is generally used as the hydroxy protecting group or the tyrosyl residue even though others, such as nitrobenzyl PNB , p methoxybenzyl PMB , and the like, could be used. The carboxyl blocking groups used in preparing the compounds of formula 2a can be any of the typical ester forming groups, including, for example, methyl, ethyl, benzyl, nitrobenzyl, p methoxybenzy l, 2,2,2 trichloroethyl, and the like. Coupling of the suitably protected N blocked amino acid or peptide fragment with a suitably protected carboxy blocked amino acid or peptide fragment in preparation of the compounds of formula 2a consists of rendering the free carboxyl function of the amino acid or peptide fragment active to the coupling reaction. This can be accomplished using any of several well recognized techniques. One such activation technique involves conversion of the carboxyl function to a mixed anhydride. The free carboxyl function is activated by reaction with another acid, typically a derivative of carbonic acid, such as an acid chloride thereof. Examples of acid chlorides used to form mixed anhydrides are ethyl chloroformate, phenyl chloro formatel sec butyl chloroformate, isobutyl chloroformate, pivaloyl chloride, and the like. Isobutyl chloroformate is preferred. Another method of activating the carboxyl function for the purpose of carrying out the coupling reaction is by conversion to its active ester derivative. Such active esters include, for example, a 2,4,5 trichlorophenyl ester, a pentachlorophenyl ester, a p nitrophenyl ester, and the like. Another coupling method available for use is the well recognized azide coupling method. Cleavage of selected blocking groups is necessary at particular points in the synthesis Se quence used in preparation of the compounds of formula 2a. A chemist of ordinary skill in the art of peptide synthesis can readily select from representative protecting groups those groups which are com patible in the sense that selective cleavage of the product can be accomplished, permitting removal of one or more but less than all of the protecting groups present on the amino acid or peptide fragment. These techniques are well recognized in the peptide art.A fuller discussion of the techniques which are available for selective cleavage is provided in the literature see Schroder and Luke, The Peptides, Volume I, Academic Press, New York, 1965 , especially the Table provided at pages 72 75 . Cleavage of carboxyl protecting groups can be accomplished by alkaline saponification. Relatively strong alkaline conditions, typicallyusing an alkalimetal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxiae, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, and the like, are generally used to deesterify the protected carboxyl group.The reaction conditions under which saponification is accomplished are well recognized in the art. The carboxyl blocking groups can also be removed by catalytic hydrogenolysis including, for example, hydro genolysis in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium on carbon. Furthermore, in those instances in which the carboxyl blocking group is p nitrobenzyl or 2,2,2 trichioroetbyl, deblocking can be accomplished by reduction in the presence of zinc and hydrochloric acid. The amino blocking groups are cleaved by treating the protected amino acid or peptide with an acid such as formic acid, trifluoroacetic acid TFA , p toluenesulfonic acid TSA , benzenesulfonic acid BSA , naphthalenesulfonic acid, and the like, to form the respective acid addition salt product. Cleavage of the amino blocking group can also be accomplished by treating the blocked amino acid or peptide with a mixture of HBr or HC1 and acetic acid to produce the corresponding hydrobromide or hydrochloride acrid addition salt. The particular method or reagent which is used will depend upon the chemical or physical characteristics of the materials involved in the specific deblocking reaction. The formula 2 compounds wherein n is zero andZ is hydrogen, the H LAPP compounds, are especially useful intermediates. These compounds are prepared by removal of the glycyl group from compound 1. The glycyl group can be selectively removed by leucine amino peptidase lap or by selective acid hydrolysis to give the H LAPP intermediate. The general sequence for the preparation of the compounds of formula 2a can be depicted as follows.In the sequence the symbol AA represents an aminoacid residue and GLAPP represents A53868 factor A. EMI32.1 In preparing the compounds of formula 2a by this sequence, it is preferable to use a compound which contains the group LAPP of the intended final product as the C terminal reactant. Examples of typical compounds of formula 2 include the following Ala Gly LAPP Tyr Ala Gly LAPP Arg Gly LAPP Tyr Arg Gly LAPP Nva Gly LAPP Tyr Nva Gly LA P Val Gly LAPP Tyr Val Gly LAPP Nle Gly LAPP Tyr Nle Gly LAPP Leu Gly LAPP Gly Leu Gly LAPP Ile Gly LAPP Gly Ile Gly LAPP Ala Gly LAPP Phe Ala Gly LAPP Met Ala Gly LAPP Leu Ala Gly LAPP Ile Ala Gly LAPP Lys Gly LAPP Pro Gly LAPP Thr Gly LAPP Trp LAPP Val Ala Gly LAPP Ser Ala Gly LAPP Nle Ala Gly LAPP Met Gly LAPP r Tyr Met Gly LAPP Phe Met Gly LAPP Leu Met Gly LAPP Ile Met Gly LAPP Val Met Gly LAPP Ser Met Gly LAPP Ala LAPP Tyr LAPP Nle LAPP Hse LAPP Ala Val LAPP Cys LAPP Cys Gly LAPP Hse Gly LAPP Val Gly LAPPi Gly Leu LAPP Gly Ala LAPP Gly Nle LAPP Phe Gly LAPP Gly Ese IAPP Nva Gly LAPP Cys Gly LAPP Gly Gly LAPP Val LAPP Ile LAPP Arg LA Asp LAPP Gly Asx LAPP Gln LAPP Glu LAPP Glx Gly LAPP Leu LAPP Nva LAPP Phe LAPP Ser LAPP and the like. This invention further relates to methods of regulating the immune system with, and compositions comprising, compounds of formulae 1, 2 and 3. The compounds of formula 3 are known in the art ses, for example, Hendlin et al., Science 166, 122 1969 , but their immunomodulating activity was heretofore unrecognized. The compound of formula 3 wherein R2 and R3 are hydrogen is the antibiotic fosfomycin. The compounds of formula 1, 2 and 3 exhibit immunomodulating activity as demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo assays which test the ability of compounds to activate macrophages and by. in vivo tests in animals with experimental intracellular infections. The compounds of formula 1 and 2 are a preferred group for this method. The related phosphonic acid antibiotics alaphosphin and fosmidomycin did not exhibit immunomodulatory activity in the in vitro assay. The activity of the compounds of formulae 1, 2 and 3 on macrophage activation has been determined according to recognized procedures. In one procedure, the ability of the compounds to activate murine macrophages in vitro was determined.Peritoneal macrophages were exposed to a compound of formula 1, 2, or 3 simultaneously with the addition of target cells. Tumor cytotoxicity of these treated macrophages was determined 48 hours later by trypan blue enumeration. The percentage of growth inhibition of P815 cells due to composition mediated macrophage activation was calculated by comparison to that of P815 cells grown in the presence of macrophages exposed to buffer.The results of tests using this procedure are provided in Tables I and II Table I Induction of Macrophage Mediated Tumor Cytotoxicity by Compound 1 Compound 1Concentration Percent Macrophage Cytotoxicity g ml Experiment 1 Experiment 2 100 53 NTa 50 35 29 25 43 32 12.5 27 39 6.25 0 0 3.12 11 14 1.56 NT 0 0 0 0 aNT not tested Table II Induction of Macrophage Medicated Tumor Cytotoxicity by FosfomycinFosfomycinConcentration Percent Macrophage Cytotoxicity g ml Experiment 1 Experiment 2 100 47 30 10 49 11 In another procedure, peritoneal macrophages were harvested after 3, 5, or 10 days from compositiontreated mice by peritoneal ravage and purified by adherence on plastic.Approximately 4 x 105 macrophages in 16 mm wells were overlaid with 4 x 104 P815 cells contained in 2 ml of Roswell Park Memorial Insti tute. 1640 Medium supplemented with 20 percent fetal calf serum. All cultures were maintained in a humidified, 5 percent CO2 in air incubator at 370C., and cytotoxicity was assessed at 48 hours on the basis of viable cell counts in a hemocytometer. Triplicate cultures were maintained for each group the mean cell count and standard error S.E. were calculated. Under these conditions, peritoneal macrophages from normal BALB c mice treated with tris buffered saline did not affect the growth of P815 target cells, as measured both by viable cell number and by DNA synthesis of the leukemia cells.The ratio of macrophages to target cells was approximately 10 1 at the beginning of each experiment, The percentage of growth inhibition of 2815 cells due to composition mediated macrophage activation was calculated by comparison to that of P815 cells grown in the presence of macrophages from buffer treated animals. The results of such a test are provided in Table III Table III In Vivo Macrophage Activation Using Compound 1 Percent Macrophage Cytotoxicity at Day 0 3 5 10 Compound 1 Dose mg kg 100 0 43 25 0 10 0 8 20 o In addition, the compounds of formulae 1, 2 and 3 have been found to be effective immunomodulators in tests in which both normal and immunosuppressed animals were infected with with intracellular infections in which the major cellular immunity is activated macrophages.Intracellular infections can be caused by bacteria, fungi, rickettsia, protozoa, and viruses including the following Mycobacteriuza tuberculosis, Brucella, Salmonella typhi, Listeria monocytogenes, Histoplasma capsulatum, Candida albicans, Chlamydiae, Legionella, Toxoplasma gondii, Besnoitia jellisoni, Plasmodium berghei, teishmaniasis, and Herpes simplex. In one test pretreatment with compound 1 was highly effective in protecting mice against a lethalListeria monocytogenes EGD infections. In the test CD1 mice weighing 18 20 g were pretreated parenterally with the test compound 5, 3, and 1 days before intravenous infection in the lateral tail vein with 0.1 ml containing 5 x 105 viable cells of Listeria monocytogenes EGD.Test compound was solubilized in pyrogen free water and administered intraperitoneally in 0.25 ml of the solution. Ten mice each were used for each concentration tested. Ten control mice were treated intraperitoneally at 5, 3, and 1 days preinfection with 0.25 ml of pyrogen free water. The mice were caged, watered, and fed daily. The number of surviving mice was counted daily for 14 days. All surviving animals at 14 days were given an arbitrary 15 day survival time. The average survival time was calculated for each group. Significant differences between the treated and control groups of mice were determined by the standard T test. Compound I was negative in the Limulus LysateTest for endotoxin and was devoid of intrinsic in vitro antibacterial activity against L. monocytogenes EDG in a standard agar difusion test. The results of the in vivo test vs. Listeria monocytogenes are summarized in Table IV.

In this test CD1 mice weighing 18 20 g were pretreated intraperitoneally or subcutaneously with test compound at 5, 3, and 1 days before intravenous infection with 5 x 106 viable cells of Candida albicans A26. Test compound was solubilized in pyrogen free water and administered in 0.25 ml of solution. Ten mice were used for each concentration tested. Ten infected mice were treated intraperitoneally or subcutaneously at 5, 3, and 1 days preinfection with 0.25 ml of pyrogenfree water as controls.The immunornodulatory effects of the test compound were studied in X irradiated mice exposed to 400R 24 hours preinfection, or mice treated intraperitoneally with 50 mg kg cyclophosphamide 5, 3, and 1 days preinfection. The mice were caged, watered, and fed daily. The number of surviving mice was counted daily. Normal mice surviving 18 days postinfection were given an arbitrary 19 day survival time.X irradiated or cyclophosphaniide treated mice surviving 12 days post infection were given an arbitrary 13 day survival time. The average survival time was calculated for each group. Significant differences between treated and untreated groups of mice were determined by T test. Compound 1 was devoid of intrinsic in vitro antifungal activity against C. albicans A26 in a standard agar diffusion test.

P 0.05 Because they have the capability for correcting immune deficiencies in subjects in need of such correction, the compounds of formulae 1, 2 and 3 are therapeutically useful in the treatment of humans and animals. As a result, the compounds of formulae 1, 2 and 3 are considered to have multiple therapeutic uses.The compounds are considered useful in assisting the collective immunity of the body by increasing or assisting in therapeutic stimulation of cellular immunity. They would thereby become useful in vivo in the treatment of diseases involving chronic infection, such as fungal or mycoplasmal infections, tuberculosis, leprosy, acute and chronic viral infections, and the like. In one application, the immunomodulatory compounds of formulae 1, 2 and 3 may be administered in combination with one or more antimicrobial agents or antibiotics. Such combinations may be used prophyl actically or therapeutically for control and or treatment of microbial infections. Further, the compounds are considered to be useful in any area in which cellular immunity is an issue and particularly where there are deficiencies in immunity such as in the Di George Syndrome congenital absence of thymus . Thus, they may be of therapeutic use in certain autoimmune disease in which damagingantibodies are present, for example, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and the like.Further, the compounds are useful in treatment of conditions in which the immune response is subnormal, such as neoplasia or organ transplantation. Administration of an effective immunoregulatory amount of the subject compounds will assist in the treatment of such conditions especially neoplasia either alone or in adjunct with other forns of treatment such as surgical removal. One aspect of the present invention is, therefore, a method for regulating the immune system of subject, human or animal, in need of such immune regulation which comprises administration to said subject an effective immunoregulatory amount of one of the subject compounds, preferably together with a pharmaceutical carrier. As used therein, the terms regulate or modulate mean that the compounds cause the immune system to support a normal, balanced state.In carrying out the methods of this invention, an effective amount of a compound of formula 1, 2 or 3 is administered parenterally to an infected or susceptible warm blooded animal. The dose which is effective to regulate the immune system will vary with the compound administered, the severity of the infection to which the immune system must respond, and the age, weight, and condition of the animal. The total dose required for protection parenterally will generally, however, be in the range of from about 5 to about 100 mg kg and preferably will be in the range of from about 10 to about 50 mg kg. In another aspect, this invention relates to compositions useful for regulating the immune system in order to control intracellular infections. These compositions comprise a compound of formula 1 or 2 together with a suitable vehicle. Compositions may be formulated for parenteral administration by methods recognized in the pharmaceutical art. Effective injectable compositions. containing these compounds may be in either suspension or solution form. In the preparation of suitable formulations it will be recognized that, in general, the water solubility of the acid addition salts is greater than that of the free bases. Similarly, the bases are more soluble in dilute acids or in acidic solutions than in neutral or basic solutions. In the solution form the compound is dissolved in a physiologically acceptable vehicle. Such vehicles comprise a suitable solvent, preservatives such as benzyl alcohol, if needed, and buffers. Useful solvents include, for example, water and aqueous alcohols, glycols, and carbonate esters such as diethyl carbonate. Such aqueous solutions contain, in general, no more than 508 of the organic solvent by volume. Injectable suspension compositions require a liquid suspending medium, with or without adjuvants, as a vehicle. The suspending medium can be, for example, aqueous polyvinylpyrrolidone, inert oils such as vegetable oils or highly refined mineral oils, or aqueous carboxymethylcellulose. Suitable physiologically acceptable adjuvants are necessary to keep the compound suspended in suspension compositions. The adjuvants may be chosen from among thickeners such as carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, and the alginates. Many surfactants are also useful as suspending agents.Lecithin, alkylphenol polyethylene oxide adducts, naphthalenesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, and the polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters are useful suspending agents. Many substances which affect the hydrophilicity, density, and surface tension of the liquid suspending medium can assist in making injectable suspensions in individual cases. For example, silicone antifoams, sorbitol, and sugars can be useful suspending agents. In order to illustrate more fully the preparation of the compounds of formulae I and 2 the following examples are provided. Example IPreparation of Compound 1A.

B. Tank Fermentation of A53868 In order to provide a larger volume of inoculum, 10 ml of incubated vegetative medium prepared as described above is used to inoculate 400 ml of a second stage vegetative growth medium having the same composition as that of the vegetative medium. This second stage medium is incubated in a two liter flask for 48 hours at 30 C. on a two inch rotary shaker at 250 rpm. Incubated second stage vegetative medium 2 L thus prepared is used to inoculate. 100 liters of sterile production medium having the same composition given in Section A. The inoculated production medium is allowed to ferment in a 165 liter fermentation tank for about 4 6 days at a temperature of 30 CC. The fermentation medium is stirred with conventional agitators and aerated with sterile air at a rate sufficient to maintain a dissolved oxygen level greater than 30 of air saturation at atmospheric pressure. C. Separation of Compound 1 Fermentation broth 200 ml , obtained as described in Section B, was filtered, using a filter aid 2 , Hyflo, Johns Manville Products Corp. . The mycelia were discarded, and the filtered broth was adsorbed onto a 16 liter Diaion HP 20 column Mitsubishi Ind. . The column was eluded with 150 liters of acetonitrile water 1 9 , collecting 4 liter fractions.Elution of compound 1 was monitored by an HPLC assay.In this assay the compound was eluted from a 1 4 x 30 cm Zorbax ODS Dupont, 12 u column at 5.1 minutes under the following conditions flow rate 2.0 ml min detection UV at 254 nm sensitivity 0.16 Absorbance Units Full Scale elution solvent 8 CH3CN in 0.1 phosphate buffer, pH 3The desired fractions were concentrated in vacuo, removing the acetonitrile to give an aqueous solution containing 167 g the concentration was determined by weighing dried aliquots of crude product.

The desired fractions were combined and lyophilized to dryness to give 200 500 mg of purified material 85 95 pure . The total yield of this material from 200 liters of fermentation broth was 5 6 g. The purified material was subjected to a limulus ameobocyte lysate LAL test for endotoxin.
