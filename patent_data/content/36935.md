# Hall effect apparatus and flux concentrator assembly therefor.

## Abstract
A Hall effect package structure 1 is provided with a cap 2 which carries integral reference plane establishing mem bers 6a, 6b, 6A, 6B for establishing the gap S between the facing ends of two elongated flux concentrator members 17A, 17B, 18A in which a semiconductor chip 15 having at least one Hall effect region is located. A pair 19 of demountable C shaped flux concentrator members 20, 21 engage therebetween the remote ends of the elongated flux concentrator members 17A, 17B, 18A .
