# Radiation image information read out system.

## Abstract
A radiation image read out system comprises a point source light for projecting a spot of stimulating rays onto a stimulable phosphor sheet carrying a radiation image stored therein, and a solid state photoelectric converter which is opposed to the spot like portion of the stimulable phosphor sheet exposed to the spot of stimulating rays and is adapted to receive light from the spot like portion. The point source light and the solid state photoelectric converter are moved with respect to the stimulable phosphor sheet to two dimensionally scan the stimulable phosphor sheet, thereby reading out the radiation image stored therein.
