# Continuous method for removing copper from lead.

## Abstract
A continuous method and apparatus for removing copper from lead comprises introducing molten lead and sulphur to the upper end of a vertical stirred reaction vessel, maintaining a dispersion of sulphur in the lead without substantial back mixing and thereafter recovering the dispersion and allowing the formed copper sulphide to float to the surface. The pro cess is suitable for continuous operation on a small scale, e.g. 3 tons per hour, is environmentally acceptable and requires a lead inventory only about one third of that required by conven tional batch processes.
