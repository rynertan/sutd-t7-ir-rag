# Screed rails.

## Abstract
A screed rail 48 for use in the in situ casting of concrete comprising beams 50, 52 forming upper and lower edges of the rail, which are connected by elements 54, 70, 74 extending therebetween. The elements are spaced along the length of the rail to provide for the passage of concrete reinforcement. For this purpose, the spaced elements may form slots 56 , or a breakable web 72, 76 can close the respective spacings, to be broken as required. In an alterna tive arrangement a screed rail 2,48 has an overall cross section with a lower portion defined by parallel sides extending a major distance from the lower edge of the rail. In use, the rail 2,48 is mounted in shoes 8,34,60 to enable the level of the rail to be accurately set.
