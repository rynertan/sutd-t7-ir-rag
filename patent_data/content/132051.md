# Electrical apparatus for influencing the metabolic characteristics of living systems.

## Abstract
An electrical apparatus for influencing metabolic charac teristics of living systems, for example to produce healing of living tissue, applies an electric field, e.g. a r.f. field, in a timed manner such that over a given cycle period, e.g. 24 hours, the field is applied for a selected portion of the cycle period and is switched off for the remainder of the period. The periods may be programmable utilising a micro processor. The field strength may be selected so as not to produce significant tissue heating.
