# Data processing system with a main processor and a co processor sharing the same resources.

## Abstract
Data processing system including a main processor 11 and a co processor 22 sharing the same I O facilities 17,18,19 as the main processor 11 and running software unknown to the main processor 11 . The main processor 11 can concurrently run other software and maintains priority over shared I O facilities 17,18,19 by providing trapping logic incorporated in a random access memory and dynam ically loadable by the main processor 11 which contains data related to the current useability by the co processor 22 of a shared I O device 17 . Additional logic is associated with the co processor 22 to manage interrupts between the co processor 22 and the system bus 16 .
