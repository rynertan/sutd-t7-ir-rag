# DEVICES FOR JOINING ANATOMICAL STRUCTURES

## Abstract
The invention provides encircling devices 10 by which anatomical structures 12 , such as blood vessels, fallopian tubes, ureters, vas deferens and outer nerve sheaths may be anastomosed. Such an encircling device 10 provides an opening that receives an end 12 of a tubular anatomical structure having a prepared opening, and the tubular struc ture is anastomosed to a second anatomical structure having a prepared opening by tethering 19 to hold the two struc tures to the encircling device 10 holding the structures under radial stress in apposition to each other to form a fluid tight peripheral seal around their openings. Such devices may be used in the manner described to join a tubular anatomical structure to a second anatomical structure having a cavity, e.g. a fallopian tube to a uterus or a ureter to the bladder.
