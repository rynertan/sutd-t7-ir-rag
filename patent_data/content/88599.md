# Ni Cr type alloy material.

## Abstract
Ni Cr type alloy materials comprising 10 to 50 atom of Cr, 5 to 25 atom of Aâ„“, and or Si, and the balance to make up 100 atom of substantially pure Ni, excelling in cold work ability, and exhibiting high electric resistance. These alloy materials possess very high electric resistance and small electrical resistance temperature coefficients over a wide temperature range from room temperature to elevated temperatures, and have excellent cold workability, mechanical properties, durability, ability to resist oxidation, corrosion, and fatigue as well as strain gauge sensitivity. The alloys are very useful as industrial materials of varying types including elec trical resistors, precision resistors, and electrically heating wires used at elevated temperatures and bracing materials, reinforcing materials, and corrosionproofed materials used at elevated temperatures.
