# Method for minimizing autodoping during epitaxial deposition.

## Abstract
The method suggests the replacement of all or part of the solid or blanket buried region, typically a subcollector region of a bipolar transistor, by a mesh or stripe shaped subcollector. During subsequent thermal processing involv ing growth of the epitaxial layer, the stripes will at least partially merge, resulting in a solid subcollector. The meth od of minimizing autodoping implies only a special design of the subcollector mask. Therefore, there is no longer any need for technological changes either in the process or in the equipment. The method also applies to other buried layers, such as, subemitters, resistors, bottom isolation regions, etc.
