# Constrained paging data processing apparatus.

## Abstract
Data processing apparatus is provided with a paging facility constrained in that the number of pages of any group of pages defined by a specific bit pattern is a first subset of virtual address bits in residence in the direct access data store is limited to n. The address translation apparatus included comprises two table look up mechanisms arranged to main tain a mapping of selected virtual to real address relationships of pages in residence, the first table look up mechanism hav ing c n addressable locations of n fields and the second table look up mechanism having c single field addressable loca tions, when c is the maximum number of pages in residence, so that, for a filled direct access data store there is one field in each table look up mechanism for each page in residence. Both table look up mechanisms are addressed by the first subset of bits of a virtual address presented for translation and, in addition, the second table look up mechanism is addressed in response to the operations of the first table look up mechanism. Either the first or the second table look up mechanism generates, the real page addresses appropri ate to the current mapping. The first table look up mechanism contains entries each identifying the states of a second subset of virtual address bits of pages of the associated group in residence. The second subset bits of a virtual address pre sented for translation are compared with all the output fields of the first table look up mechanism using n compare circuits, outputting to the second table look up addressing mechan ism. The remaining page address bit positions of the pre sented virtual address are compared with the output of the second table look up mechanism, the fields of the second table look up mechanism containing such remaining virtual address bits appropriate to the pages in residence. If either comparator fails to detect an equality a miss is registered and the second table look up mechanism is only exercised in rela tion to potential hits.
