## Description
ALKYLTHIO AND ALKYLSULFINVL BENZ IMIDAZOLE DERIVATIVES The present invention involves novel substituted 2 Emonoannelated 3,4 , 4,5 , and 5,6 pyridylalkylenesulfinyl benzimi dazoles which are useful as gastric antisecretory and cytoprotective agents. Gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases are characterized by inflammation, specifically by the presence of edema, characteristic inflammatory cells i.e., leucocytes, histiocytes, and macrophages , and, in some cases, necrosis and ulceratipn of the surface epithelium.These inflammatory diseases are known to be caused by a wide variety of agents present in the gastrointestinal tract which are known to attack the surfaces thereof, producing the inflammatory disease response. Such agents include micro organisms viruses and fungi , bacterial toxins, certain pharmaceutical agents antibiotics and antiinflammatory steroids , and chemical agents bile salts, toxic household chemicals . Gastric acid itself is also capable of attacking the stomach lining and producing an inflammatory state. One means of preventing or treating certain gastrointestinal diseases, specifically gastric diseases, is by the inhibition of gastric acid secretion. In situations where the integrity of the gastric mucosal barrier is compromised, gastric acid secretion can result in erosion of the epithelial cells with consequent inflammation and ulceration. Inhibition of such untoward gastric acid induced effects can be achieved by the administration of a pharmacological agent effective to inhibit gastric secretion. One class of such agents effective to inhibit gastric acid secretion are the gastric antisecretory prostaglandins. These substances are known to be effective in the treatment and care of gastric and duodenal ulcers as a result of the inhibition of gastric secre tion. See, e.g., U.S. Patent 3,903,297 Robert, Method of Treatment and Prophylaxis of Gastric Hypersecretion and Gastric Duodenal UlcersUsing Prostaglandin Analogs , and Robert, Antisecretory Property ofProstaglandins, Prostaglandin Symposium of the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology 16 17 October 1967, Interscience, New York, page 47 1978 . Another important class of antisecretory agents are the histamine H2 receptor antagonists, including metiamide and most importantly cimetidine, N cyano N methyl N 2 5 methyl iH imida zole 4 yl methyl thio ethyl guanidine.See, the Merck Index, 9thEdition, Appendix, page App l 1976 , and Physician s Desk Reference, 36th Edition, 1812 1814 1982 . Another means of treating such gastrointestinal diseases is through cytoprotection. Certain pharmacological agents have heretofore been known to be useful in exerting a cytoprotective effect on the gastrdintestinal tract. This cytoprotective effect is manifest in the ability of such compounds to treat or prevent non traumaticallyinduced, non neoplastic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. References describing such cytoprotective effects of prostaglandins are U.S.. Pat. No. 4,083,998 Robert, Treatment of Inflammatory Diseases of the Mammalian Large Intestine with Cytoprotective Prostaglandins , issued April 11, 1978, U.S. Pat. No. 4,081,553 Robert, Cytoprotective Prostaglandins for. Use in Intestinal Diseases , issued March 28, 1978, and U.S. Pat.No. 4,097,603 Robert, Gastric Cytoprotection with Non Antisecretory Doses ofProstaglandins , issued June 27, 1978. Gastric cytoprotection is a distinct pharmacological property which is unrelated to gastric antisecretory effects. See, e.g., Robert, U.S. Pat. No. 4,097,603, Gastric Cytoprotection With Non Antisecretory Doses of Prostaglandins, Robert, Cytoprotection by Prostaglandins, Gastroenterology 77 i61 767 1979 , Robert, Current History of Cytoprotection, Prostaglandins 21 supp 89 1981 , and Robert, et al., Cytoprotection byProstaglandins in Rats, Gastroenterology, 77 433 443 1979 . Thus, compounds which are gastric anti secretory agents may not be cytoprotective agents and vice versa.PRIOR ART U.S. Patent 4,045,563 discloses certain substituted 2 pyridyl alkylenesulfi nyl benzimidazoles having gastric acid secretion inhibiting effects. U.S. Patent 4,255,431 discloses certain 2 2 benzimidazolyl pyridines which are useful in inhibiting gastric secretion. Finally, U.S. Patent 4,359,465 discloses the cytoprotective use of certain heterocyclyalkylsulfinylbenzimidazoles.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention particularly provides a compound of the formula I, wherein X is a S, or b SO wherein A and B are the same or different and are a hydrogen, b OR1, c COR1, d C02R1, or e CO2M wherein R1 is C1 C4 alkyl wherein M is a pharmacologically acceptable cation wherein D is a bicyclic substituent of the formula II, III, orIV wherein V is a o, b Ss or c CH2 and wherein n is zero or one. The carbon atom content of various hydrocarbon containing moieties is indicated by a prefix designating the minimum and maximum number of carbon atoms in the moeity, i.e., the prefix Cj Cj indicates a moiety of the integer i to the integer j carbon atoms, inclusive. Thus C1 C4 alkyl refers to alkyl of one to 4 carbon atoms, inclusive, or methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and isomeric forms thereof.

The compounds of the present invention will be named herein using the Chemical Abstracts numbering system see Naming and Indexing ofChemical Substances for Chemical Abstracts during the Ninth CollectivePeriod 1972 1976 , a reprint of section IV from the Volume 76 IndexGuide. Compounds of this invention have been tested in one or mbre standard laboratory tests which demonstrate gastric anti secretory activity. Thus, compounds of this invention have been shown to be effective as inhibitors of K dependent ATP hydrolysis by isolated hog gastric membranes enriched with gastric H K ATP ase. In this system, 2 E 6 azachroman 5 yl methyl sulfinyl 5 methoxybenzimidazole Example 6 has been shown to be the most effective with an EDso of 1 x 10 5 molar.In a test for in vivo inactivation of H K ATP ase in the rat 2 6 azachroman 5 yl methyl sulfinyl 5 methoxybenzimidazole Example 6 , was shown to be the most effective, having an ED50 of 1 mg kg when administered subcutaneously. Further, these compounds have been shown to be active as inhibitors of gastric acid secretion in rats both subcutaneously and intraduodenally. In these test systems one compound was found to be the most effective, 2 6 azachroman 5yl methyl sulfinyl 5 methoxybenzimidazole Example 6 , having an ED50 in the rat gastric antisecretory assay, administered intraduodenally, of 0.7 mg per kg. 2 5,6,7,8 tetrahydroisoquinoline 1 yl methyl sulfinyl 5 methoxybenzimidazole Example 4 exhibited an ED50 of 1.8 mg kg when administered subcutaneously.Compounds of this invention have been shown to be active as inhibitors of acid secretion in isolated gastric glands of the rabbit. In this system, 2 5,6,7,8 tetrahydroi soqui nol i ne 1 yl methyl sul fi nyl 5 methoxybenzimidazol e Example 4 was shown to be the most effective with an ID50 of 8 x 10 7 molar. Certain of the compounds of this invention are preferred because of their long duration of action when administered parenterally e.g., subcutaneously . Thus, E 5,6,7,8 tetrahydroisoquinolin 1 ylmethyl sulfi nyl benzimidazole and 2 E 5 thia 5,6 ,7 ,8 tetrahydroi soquinol in 1 ylmethyl sulfinyl benzimidazol when administered at 10 mg kg subcutaneously inhibited rat gastric H K ATPase activity with t1 2 of 4 days and 2 days, respectively. In general, the preferred compounds of this invention are those of the formula I wherein A and B are hydrogen, X is SO, and D is a bicyclic substitutent of the formula II. All of the compounds of this invention are useful as gastric antisecretory agents. Compounds of this invention are administered for gastric antisecretory purposes orally, parenterally, e.g., intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intraparenterally , rectally, or vaginally in forms such as pills, capsules, solutions, suspensions, suppositories, or bougies. The compounds of this invention are formulated into these pharmaceutical compositions by means known to the pharmaceutical art. An ordinarily skilled physician can readily determine persons suffering from gastrointestinal diseases characterized by the gastricacid induced effects noted above. These conditions are treated using the compounds of the present invention. Typical dose ranges for the compounds of this invention range from about 0.01 lig per kg to about 250 mg per kg, preferably from about 0.1 to 100 mg per kg. The choice of the use, route, and frequency of administration of the compounds of this invention depends on the weight, age, and gastrointestinal disease of the patient and the particular compound employed. These decisions are readily made by a physician of ordinary skill in the art. The compounds of this invention may also exert cytoprotective effects. If employed for this purpose, they could be administered as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. 4,359,465, particularly cols. 7 and 8 thereof. The doses employed for this purpose would in general be less than those used for gastric antisecretory effects. The compounds of the present invention are prepared by the methods depicted in Charts A H. In the Charts, A, B, V, and D, and n are defined as described above and X is OS02CH3 or Cl.

The reaction is expediently carried out in inert solvents, for example aromatic or chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, methylene chloride or chloroform. The reaction temperature is between 700 C and the boiling point of the solvent used, but preferably between 300 C and 200 C depending on the reactivity of the oxidizing agent and the degree of dilution .The oxidation with halogens or hypohalogenites e.g., with aqueous sodium hypochloride solution , which is carried out expediently at temperatures between 0 and 300 C has also proved to be very advantageous. The reaction of A 5 with A 6 Chart A, scheme 2 is preferably carried out in inert solvents, such as those which are also usually employed for the reaction of enulate ions with alkylating agents.Examples which may be mentioned are aromatic solvents, such as benzene or toluene. The reaction temperature is as a rule between 0 and 1200C depending on the nature of the alkali metal atom M preferably at the boiling point of the solvent. For example, if M represents Li lithium and the reaction is carried out in benzene, the boiling point of benzene 800 C is preferred. Chart B depicts a method for preparing formula A 2 compounds. A methylated compound of the formula B 1 a , B 1 b , or B 1 c , corresponding to substituents II, III, and IV within the scope of D is treated with acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide or metachloroperbenzoic acid to yield the formula B 2 N oxide. This compound is then treated with acetic anhydride to yield the formula B 3 acetate.

The formula B 4 alcohol is then converted to the chloride by treatment in methylene chloride with methanesulfonyl chloride and triethylamine. Chart C depicts a method for preparing compounds of the formulasB 1 a , B 1 b , and B 1 c wherein V is CH2 and n is one. An isoquinoline compound of the formula C l, with or without methyl substitution, is hydrogenated under strong acidic conditions using a Parr apparatus and 85 platinum oxide catalyst. Unsubstituted isoquinoline compounds may be methylated by conventional means, e.g., by treatment with methyllithium in dimethyl ether. This procedure is also described in Vierhapper, et al., J. Org. Chem. 40 2729 1975 . Chart D, E and F depict methods for preparing the oxa annelated pyridine intermediates. In Chart D, a compound of the formula D 1 which is available commercially or can be prepared by known means is treated with ethyl bromoacetate or ethyl acrylate to obtain the formula D 2 compound wherein n is zero or 1, respectively. This compound is then treated successively with lithium aluminum hydride, and a strong acid e.g., sulfuric acid to the formula D 3 compound. This alcohol is treated with p toluene sulfonic acid to yield the formulaD 4 compound. This unsaturated compound is treated with xylene in the presence of a palladium on carbon catalyst to yield the formula D 5 compound which is alkylated by conventional means e.g., methyllithium to yield the formula D 6 compound. The conversion of D 1 toD 5 is described in Sliwa, J. Het. Chem. 12 809 1975 .This procedure is modified using ethyl bromoacetate to obtain Formula D 6 compounds wherein n is 0. In Chart E, a compound of the formula E 1, a well known and readily available compound, is treated succesively with mercuric acetate and sodium borohydride to yield the formula E 2 compound which is alkylated as described above to yield the formula E 3 compound. InChart F, the formula F 1 compound, which is also a well known and readily available compound, is similarly converted to the formula F 3 compound as described above.

Chem. 47 895 1982 . Chart G depicts a method to prepare certain annelated pyridine intermediates to be. used in Charts B and A. A phenethylamine of the formula G 1 is reacted with acetic anhydride to yield the formula G 2 compound. This compound is treated with polyphosphoric acid to yield the formula G 3 compound. This compound is treated with xylene in the presence of a palladium on carbon catalyst to yield the formula G 4 compound which is hydrogenated e.g., by treatment under acidic conditions with hydrogen in a Parr apparatus in the presence of 85 platinum oxide catalyst to yield the formula G 5 compound. Chart H depicts a method of preparing the 2 mercaptobenzimidazoles used in Chart A. A substituted phenylenediamine compound of the formula H 1 such compounds are well known and readily available or can be prepared by known means is treated with potassium hydroxide and carbon sulfide to yield the formula H 2 compound. This is also described in Preparation 21. Chart I depicts a method for preparing compounds of the formula I wherein V is S, n is O or 1, and the bicyclic substituent is of the formula B 1 a and B 1 c . A pyridinyl ethanol or propanol of the formula 1 1 well known, readily available compounds is treated with tert butyldimethylsilyl chloride in an inert solvent to yield the formula 1 2 product. This product is treated with methyl lithium to yield a mixture of 2 and 6 substituted products of the formula I 3. The silyl group is removed by treatment with acid, e.g., hydrochloric acid, to yield the formula 1 4 product. Treatment of this product with thionyl chloride yields the formula I 5 chloride, which is then treated with meta chloroperbenzoic acid to yield the formula I 6N oxide. The 2 and 6 isomers are conveniently separated by chromatography at this stage. Treatment of the I 6 N oxide with sulfuric acid followed by fuming nitric acid yields the formula 1 7 nitrate. Adding this product to a solution of ethanol in which hydrogen chloride gas has been bubbled yields the formula I 8 chloride. Reaction of this product with 2 mercaptobenzoxazole in acetonitrile yields the formula 1 9 product, which is treated with sodium hydroxide in ethanol to yield the formula I 10 product. This product is then reacted as described in Chart B to yield the corresponding chloride, which is then converted to the final product as described in Chart A. Chart J depicts a method for preparing compounds of the formulaB 1 b wherein V is S and n is O or 1. A compound of the Formula J 1, which can be prepared by known means, is oxidized with metachloroperbenzoic acid to afford N oxide J 2. This N oxide is reacted with 2 mercapto 1,3 benzoxazole in base to give J 3, and treated with sodium hydroxide in ethanol solvent to yield the cyclic thioether of the Formula J 4. The remaining steps starting with J 4 to the final compounds follow the same reaction procedures described in Chart I, i.e., 1 10 to 1 15. All of the compounds of this invention are prepared by the procedures described above.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention is seen more fully by the examples given below.Preparation 1 5,6,7,8 Tetrahydro 2 methylquinoline Refer to Chart C conversion of C i to C 2 . 7.8 g 54.55 mmol of 2 methylquinoline, 40 ml 12N hydrochloric acid, and 1.00 g of platinumoxide are placed in a Parr apparatus and treated with hydrogen at a pressure of 50 psi.
