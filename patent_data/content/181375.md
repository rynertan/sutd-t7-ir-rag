## Description
The present invention relates to a heat pump apparatus incorporating at least two energy converters. The apparatus is particularly adapted to the use of low grade energy sources such as air heated by the combustion of gas, oil, exhaust gases, geothermal fluids, waste gases and solar energy. A heat pump apparatus embodying the invention is capable of providing both heat and cooling for a space such as a building. For over forty years, residential and small commercial buildings have been cooled almost exclusively by electrically driven compressor air conditioning units. The primary reasons for this are 1 the relatively low initial cost of the equipment 2 a high coefficient of performance, usually two to three, which, together, with dependability and long equipment liftime provides low operating costs and 3 the use of air cooled condensers and evaporators which reduces the system s complexity and costs. The coefficient of performance COP equals refrigerant effect Q divided by net work input W . This may be expressed as COP Q W where Q is the heat C. absorbed by the unit per mass refrigerant and W is the work supplied to the unit by the compressor. Existing gas fired cooling systems generally have on the other hand 1 a low coefficient of performance, usually less than 0.7 and therefore relatively high operating costs 2 the need for a cooling tower to serve for the purposes of the condenser which increases the initial and operating cost of the system and 3 usually require the use of corrosive substances such as ammonia or lithium bromide solutions that reduce equipment lifetime and increase maintenance and operating costs. As a result, whereas the residential market for gas is substantial in the winter and when heating is otherwise required, it is not significant in the cooling season. This contributes to poor utilization of distribution and storage capacities of the gas and liquid fuel industries as well as for the electric utilities. With the introduction of electrically driven heat pumps which have a coefficient of performance of three to four and are capable of both heating and cooling, it can be anticipated that the efficient distribution of gas and liquid fuel from producer to consumer will be further eroded. If this is not to occur, a gas energized cooling system must be provided which is realistically competitive with conventional existing air conditioning systems for relatively small buildings. If such a system is to be competitive, it must have a coefficient of performance reasonably competitive with that of the electrically driven heat pump and otherwise be competitive which means that it will have the same low initial equipment costs, long equipment lifetime and dependability of conventional heating and cooling systems, or better. The coefficient of performance of gas fired cooling systems may be increased by utilizing the heat of combustion in a two stage adsorption system. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of such systems including the need for a cooling tower, the initial investment and operating and maintenance requirements are not as a practical matter compatible with residential and small building heating and cooling needs. Improvements in the efficiency of energy intensive systems can often be gained through the use of energy recycling methods. The principle of energy recycling is old and has been used in practical applications since at least the 1920 s. The device employed for this purpose is usually called a regenerator and is used extensively in combination with gas turbines in large power plants. A regenerator may be a rotor having cylindrical heat transfer packing through which hot and cold gases are passed. Heat temporarily stored in such packing from the hot gas is transferred into the cold gas stream by steadily rotating the cylindrical body which temporarily stores the thermal energy. Fixed two bed regenerator systems are also known. Fixed two bed systems comprise two containers of heat storage material wherein the storage and recovery of heat is accomplished by the reversal of gas flow in the fixed bed system. The closing and opening of relevant valves controlling the hot cold gas allows the start of the flow of the cold hot gas through the packing. With the two bed regenerator system, one of the regenerators is, at any instant, preheating the cold gas while the other bed is cooling the hot gas. Regenerators are common in glass making furnaces where they must be able to withstand entrance gas temperatures on the order of 1600 C. The state of the art on existing commercial devices used for the recycling of energy may be found in Thermal Energy Storage and Regeneration by Schmidt and Willmott, published in 1981 by Hemisphere Publishing Corporation, McGraw Hill. Attention is also invited to U.S. Patent No. 4,183,227, which discloses an apparatus and process according to the first part of claims 1 and 19 resp. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided, a heat pump apparatus comprising, at least two separate hermetically sealed solid gas adsorption systems each containing a working refrigerant and heat exchange means connecting said systems and including conduit means received in each system for the passage of a heat exchange fluid therethrough in heat exchange relationship with the adsorbent material, which is in engagement with said conduit means in each system, said connection of said systems by said heat exchange means being arranged so that heat generated during the adsorption cycle of one said system is transferred through said heat exchange means and is used as part of the input energy required in the desorption cycle of the other said system, whereby the need for external energy input for said desorption is greatly reduced, characterised in that, said conduit means is arranged with respect to at least one of said systems so as to be in immediate thermally conductive relationship with said adsorbent material which is disposed along the conduit means and is so dimensioned and configured that the transmission of thermal energy by the adsorbent material in a direction transverse to the conduit means occurs more rapidly than the transmission of thermal energy by the adsorbent material along the conduit means thereby creating a propagating temperaturefront which advances through the adsorbent material, during each operating cycle, in the direction of flow of said heat exchange fluid through the conduit, the propagating temperature front presenting a temperature transition, the temperature of heat exchange fluid on the upstream side of the temperature front being significantly different from the temperature of heat exchange fluid on the downstream side of the temperature front, and the propagating temperature front causing the working refrigerant to be adsorbed by or desorbed from the adsorbent material, such that the movement of working refrigerant into or out of the adsorbent material advances through the adsorbent material in the same direction as the flow of the heat exchange fluid in the conduit means. The apparatus may provide continuous refrigeration and or heating from a single low grade heat source. The heat exchange conduit means may comprise a metal conduit for said fluid having an effective wall thickness of 0.5 millimetres or less, the volumetric thermal conductivity of said solid adsorbent being substantially less than said conduit, said solid adsorbent comprises slices disposed along said conduit in immediate thermal communication therewith, the slices having a thickness of not more than ten millimetres, said conduit and said solid adsorbent thereon being so arranged that a heat transfer takes place between the fluid flowing in said conduit and said solid adsorbent such that when said fluid and said solid adsorbent have different initial temperatures these initial different temperatures are maintained across a propagating temperature front which is propagated along said solid adsorbent in the direction of fluid flow, the temperature of the solid adsorbent behind said front being about the same as said fluid behind said front, and the temperature of the solid adsorbent remaining at about its initial temperature forward of said front. According to a further aspect, the invention provides a process for heating and cooling an interior space using a low grade heat source, comprising the steps of In preferred embodiments, the instant invention provides an adsorption system heat pump, preferably gas fired, which has a cooling coefficient of performance of at least one and possibly as high as two and a heating coefficient of performance of two or more, depending on the specific cooling and heating requirements and available energy, such coefficient approaching the system s Carnot efficiency which, in terms of the coefficient of performance, is three to four. This is an increase of two to three times the presently obtainable values with single stage adsorption or absorption systems and approaches the efficiency of electrically driven heat pumps which are burdened by significantly higher power costs. The preferred adsorption system heat pump is, moreover, simple in design and has a relatively low initial cost and long lifetime with little or no maintenance. Of course, an increased coefficient of performance can be obtained in known systems with two stage adsorption systems. However, the complexity of such a modified system is increased considerably and the need for a cooling tower is not eliminated. Accordingly, two state systems are not generally suitable for relatively small installations due to their substantially greater initial equipment costs as well as their operating and maintenance costs. It is known to use zeolite as an adsorbent material, as disclosed in U.S.Patent No.4,034,569 of July 12, 1977 and U.S. Patent No. 4,138,850 of February 13, 1979. The preferred heat pump apparatus also utilizes zeolite as an adsorbent for a refrigerant gas. However, in contrast to earlier heat pump systems in which the emphasis has been on cooling, the preferred form of the present invention is a heat pump which is capable of providing both heating and cooling and employs two energy converter units. One unit can be desorbing while the other unit is adsorbing, the thermal energy from the adsorbing zeolite being used in part to heat the desorbing zeolite. In addition, the inventive heat pump employs the development of a temperature front which propagates through the metal zeolite heat exchanger. The creation of a temperature front permits reuse of as much as ninety percent of the thermal energy available during the sorption processes. The use of zeolite as the adsorbent, two energy converters with heat exchange and the propagating temperature front through the heat exchanger, results in the coefficient of performance obtained by the apparatus and process approaching the theoretical Carnot efficiency of three to four. In other words, the preferred gas fired zeolite heat pump embodying the instant invention is substantially as efficient as an electrical heat pump having, however, the further advantage of markedly reduced operation costs. Although natural gas or oil or any gaseous or liquid fuel which produces hot gases of combustion may be used for the system, it also may employ the waste heat generated by the internal combustion engine or any other source of hot gas or liquid which provides a temperature in the range of 250 to 400 F 120 to 205 C . For example, there are various types of solar collectors which can generate temperatures up to 600 F 315 C . There is also a need in various manufacturing and process plants to dissipate waste heat which could be used as the heat energy source for the instant invention. As a general proposition, any fluid source at temperatures higher than those required can be thermally diluted through a number of mechanisms by further fluid having a cooler temperature and this may or may not involve intermixing of fluids. With natural gas or oil, the ultimate temperature is, in fact, lowered by direct intermixing of outside air with the gases of combustion to provide the fluid temperature desired. Accordingly, although the ultimate heat source may not be low grade , by the intermixing of other fluids, it is converted into the equivalent of a low grade heat source. For the purposes of this specification, a low grade heat source is considered any heat source reasonably compatible with the system wherein an effective heat differential can be provided, the maximum requisite differential being less than roughly 200 deg.C or 360 deg.F. The preferred adsorbent is a zeolite, either natural or artificial, although the natural zeolites are preferred. Operable natural zeolites include chabazite, clinoptilolite, modernite, erionite and others. An acceptable synthetic zeolite is manufactured by Union Carbide and is known as Linde molecular sieve type 13X. Various molecular sieve zeolites are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,882,243 2,882,244 3,012,853 3,130,007 3,181,231 3,329,629 3,720,756 3,808,326 3,941,871 3,969,276 3,972,983 3,976,598 3,979,335 4,016,245 4,034,065, and 4,046,859. The publication Natural Zeolites, Occurrence, Properties, Use edited by L.B. Sand and F.A. Mumpton, Peragamon Press, provides considerable information on various types of natural zeolites. Zeolites are molecular sieves which in their dehydrated state comprise crystals interlaced with regularly spaced channels of molecular dimensions. This network of uniform channels or pores comprises almost fifty percent of the total volume in the crystals. Empty cavities of such molecular sieves have a strong tendency to capture water molecules. The interaction of the dipole or quadrupole moment of gas molecules with the non uniform electric fields generated in the crystalline structure of the zeolite, is strong and nonlinear. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, at least two energy converters are contained in respective separate sealed containers so that when the heat pump is energized one of the energy converters or containers is always in the desorption part of the cycle. The use of two separate zeolite containers allows for the exchange of thermal energy from the container being cooled which is in the adsorption part of the cycle to the container being heated which is in the desorption part of the cycle. This results in a system which can provide an extremely high coefficient of performance. If only about thirty percent of the energy is exchanged, the heating coefficient of the cycle increases from about 0.7 to above one and the heating coefficient of performance is increased to above two. If sixty five percent of the energy is recycled, the cooling coefficient of performance increases to two and the heating coefficient of performance increases to about three. It is to be emphasized that since the system is cyclic and maximum efficiency is obtained by continuous recycling of the energy converters, the advantages of continuous operation suggest greater efficiency may be obtained in a typical heating system with the utilization of more than two energy converters whereby periodic complete shut off of the system is avoided. Thus, although the system described herein has only two energy converters, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that further converters may be added to the system in various arrangements. The invention is capable of providing a gas adsorption heat pump with significantly increased coefficient of performance in both its heating and cooling modes whereby it is economically competitive with electrically driven heat pumps. In order that the invention may be better understood, several preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings, wherein Figure 1 is a diagram showing the amount of water adsorbed by a zeolite molecular sieve at various temperature and absolute pressures of water vapor measured in millimeters of mercury Figure 2 is a diagram similar to Figure 1 except it shows the amount of water adsorbed by lithium bromide at various temperatures and absolute water vapor pressures measured in millimeters of mercury Fig. 3 illustrates schematically a simplified concept of the zeolite cycle in accordance with the instant invention Fig. 4 is a diagram which discloses equilibrium loading of water as to pounds of adsorbed water in 100 pounds of activated zeolite molecular sieve, type Linde 13X, showing specifically the cycle of desorption and adsorption of water vapor in the instant invention Fig. 5 is a diagram which illustrates the temperature time profile of a conventional zeolite heat exchanger Fig. 6 is a diagram which illustrates the temperature time profile of the zeolite heat exchanger system in accordance with the instant invention Fig. 7 is a graph which shows time duration solutions to the heat flow equation for zeolites of various thicknesses to obtain the profile shown in Fig. 6 Fig. 8 is a schematic of energy converters in accordance with the instant invention incorporated into the heating and cooling system of a building Fig. 9 illustrates an embodiment in a partial section elevational view wherein two energy converters are within a single pressure container Fig. 10 is a sectional plan view of the container and energy converters shown in Fig. 9 Fig. 11 illustrates diagramatically a gas burner which is employed with the container and energy converters shown in Figs. 9 and 10 Fig. 12 is a bottom plan view of a packet or tile containing zeolite which is received by the fluid passageways for combustion and cooling gases in Fig. 9 Fig. 13 is a top plan view of the packet shown in Fig. 12 Fig. 14 is a schematic similar to Fig. 3 of a further zeolite cycle in accordance with the invention for the heating mode Fig. 15 shows the actual output temperature of a heat exchanger with time for different lengths of heat exchanger Fig. 16 is similar to Figs. 5 and 6 showing actual performance wherein 70 percent energy is cycled between two containers Fig. 17 is a graph showing measured performance of zeolite in desorbing water vapor for different thicknesses of zeolite Fig. 18 is a perspective view in partial section showing zeolite bricks or tiles enclosed in a copper foil envelope as utilized to generate the data shown in Fig. 17 Fig. 19 illustrates the gas fluid flow around a copper flow envelope as shown in Fig. 18 wherein the envelopes are in parallel Fig. 20 is similar to Fig. 19 except that it discloses the zeolite envelopes in series for the gas fluid flow.

As indicated above, zeolites form a family of materials with a unique, open, cage like crystalline structure. Their atomic structure is such that cavities interconnected by channels or tunnels are formed on an atomic scale. There are over thirty types of zeolites with cavity sizes ranging from three to over ten angstroms and connecting channels of various sizes. Because of this open porous structure, zeolites are capable of adsorbing large amounts of a variety of refrigerant gases ranging from water vapor, ammonia and carbon dioxide to different fluorocarbons, chlorocarbons and hydrocarbons at near room temperatures. The strong non uniform internal electric fields which occur at the atomic level in the zeolite structure in interaction with the polar moments of gas molecules results in an adsorption energy. The interaction is extremely nonlinear and exhibits saturation behavior in its pressure dependence. Fig. 1 presents the adsorption isotherms of water vapor and zeolite. Fig. 2 presents comparable adsorption isotherms for a lithium bromide water system. The non linearity and saturation behavior of zeolites is obvious and at pressures above ten millimeters mercury absolute, the adsorbed amount is almost independent of pressure and entirely dependent on temperature. The solubility of ammonia in water, of water vapor in lithium bromide and the adsorption of refrigerant gases on surface adsorbents such as silica gel, activated alumina and activated carbon depend exponentially on k RT where H is the energy of solution of adsorption and T is the absolute temperature and R is the gas constant. In other words, they obey the Arrhenius equation. Adsorption in zeolites, in contrast, are shown by Dubinin M.M. Dubinin V.A. Astakov, Molecular Sieve Zeolites II , American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C. 1971, pp. 69 85 to depend exponentially on at least the second and as high as the fifth power of H RT. This extreme non linearity of thermoactivation makes zeolites well suited for heat pump applications by reducing the influence of condensation pressure and temperature on the coefficient of performance of the cycle. The concept of the zeolite cycle of the instant invention is shown schematically in Fig. 3. The zeolite is divided into two separate hermetically sealed spaces, enclosures or containers of energy converters designated generally by reference numerals 120 and 121. Each space is provided with its own condenser 122 and its own evaporator 124 which can in fact be a single structure as will be explained hereinbelow. In Fig. 3, converter 120 is in the generator mode whereas converter 121 is in the adsorber mode. Both converters 120 and 121 have extending vertically therethrough a plurality of heat exchange fluid conduits 125 see Figs. 9 and 10 . Such conduits are surrounded by zeolite adsorbent in a manner to be subsequently described. When heat exchange fluid enters, it is received by the conduits 125 Fig. 9 and is preheated by the heat in the zeolite and structure of converter 121, such heat having been provided when converter 121 was in its previous generator mode. The zeolite and associated structure in converter 121 cool slowly and as the zeolite cools, it adsorbs refrigerant vapor from the converter s evaporator 124. The evaporation of refrigerant at the evaporator provides cooling which may be employed to cool a building or rejected to the atmosphere. The generated heat of adsorption plus the specific heat of the zeolite and associated structure in converter 121 increases the temperature of the heat exchange fluid passing through conduits 125 to a temperature which is decreasing in time but remains above about 100 F 38 C . Thus heat exchange fluid enters from inlet conduit 126 and travels through conduits 125 and exits the converter 121 through a bottom conduit 127. Heat exchange fluid from bottom conduit 127 passes through a heating station 130 Fig. 3 which comprises a source of heat such as a burner 151 that provides a gas flame to heat the heat exchange fluid. The heat exchange fluid is conveyed through a further bottom conduit 131 of converter 120 and into its fluid conduit 125 wherein the heated heat exchange fluid heats the zeolite causing it to desorb. The gas combustion is controlled, as necessary, by means well known in the art to heat and maintain for the part of the cycle, the heat exchange fluid in conduit 131 at about 400 F 205 C before it enters conduit 125 in converter 120. Here, the zeolite which has been cooled to about 95 F 35 C during the previous cycle is heated to the temperature of about 400 F 205 C . As it is heated, the refrigerant gas is desorbed and pressure in the converter 120 increases so that the desorbed vapor can be condensed at a relatively high temperature about 100 F 38 C . The heat of condensation which takes place in the condenser 122 of converter 120 is rejected to the outside air or to a heat sink or is used, in part, for heating needs such as heating water during the cooling season. During the heating season, however, the heat is used to provide part or all of the heating load. The heat exchange fluid from converter 120 exits through the outlet conduit 132 considerably cooled due to the heat exchange which takes place in converter 120. During the heating season, as indicated in Fig. 14, the heat exchange fluid may be further cooled by additional heat exchange means 172 to about 100 F 38 C . After the above portion of the cycle is completed, the process, the flow of heat exchange fluid, is reversed. Outlet conduits 127 and 132 become inlet conduits whereas inlet conduits 126 and 131 become outlet conduits and the direction of flow through the heating station 130 is reversed. Converter 120 becomes the adsorber and converter 121 becomes the generator of the refrigerant gas. The remainder of the cycle is a repetition of the above described cycle with the condenser 122 in converter 121 heating and the evaporator 124 in converter 120 cooling. Thus, one adsorber is supplying heat and one adsorber supplying cooling at all times, and the duties alternate with the reversal of heat exchange fluid flow. Fig. 4 discloses typical adsorption isosteres for zeolite and water vapor. Isosteres are lines of constant loading of the refrigerant gas water vapor into the zeolite as a function of the zeolite s temperature and the refrigerant gases dew point. At 100 F 38 C zeolite temperature and 47 F 8 C refrigerant temperature indicated by point A, the zeolite adsorbs about twenty three percent of its weight in water vapor. The adsorption starts with the water vapor at about nine millimeters of mercury or less. The zeolite is next heated to 160 F 71 C before it is possible for the vapor to start being condensed at a 100 F 38 C condenser temperature. This is represented by point B. The gas pressure in the system is raised to about fifty millimeters of mercury or higher by the heating of the gas before it commences to condense. From 160 F to 400 F 71 to 205 C , as represented by point C, the zeolite desorbs from twenty three percent to eight percent, or a total of fifteen percent by weight, of its refrigerant vapor which is condensed at the 100 F 38 C . The Zeolite next cools from 400 F to 305 F 205 C to 151 C point D . This reduces the pressure of the refrigerant gas in the converter to about nine millimeters of mercury or less and upon further cooling from 305 F 151 C to 100 F 38 C , the latter represented by point A, the refrigerant gas is evaporated from the evaporator 124 at 47 F 8 C and the zeolite in the converter adsorbs fifteen percent by weight of the refrigerant gas whereupon its percentage of water vapor by weight is increased from eight percent to twenty three percent. The cycle is thus completed. From this diagram, it will be understood that heat exchange between converters, one in the generator mode and the other in the adsorber mode, takes place in the range of 160 F to 305 F 71 to 151 C at the minimum. The specific heat of the zeolite given in BTUs per pound degree Fahrenheit varies from 0.3 and 0.1 depending upon the amount of vapor desorbed. The heat of adsorption varies from 1200 to 1500 BTUs 1.3 x 10⁶ to 1.4 x 10⁶ joules per pound and the desorption rate is about 0.0625 percent for each degree Fahrenheit. This provides a desorption contribution so that the specific heat plus desorption remains almost constant and at about one BTU per pound for each degree Fahrenheit of temperature change. Therefore at a constant rate of heat input, the rise in temperature with time without desorption, from 100 F to 160 F 38 C to 71 C is over three times faster than when desorption is taking place from 160 F to 400 F 71 C to 205 C . Similarly, during the cooling part of the cycle, the cooling rate provides a constant heat loss of up to five times more rapid without adsorption being present from 500 F to 305 F 60 C to 151 C than when the adsorption is occurring from 305 F to 100 F 151 C to 38 C . Fig. 5 shows the theoretical temperature time profile for the zeolite of the zeolite containers. Assuming all of the zeolite in the converters was at the same temperature and simultaneously followed the temperature profiles of Fig. 4, 37.5 percent of the adsorber energy is transferred from the converter in the adsorber mode to the converter in the generator mode before the two temperatures cross at about 240 F 115 C . Allowing for twenty percent irreversible losses in the heat exchanger, a net energy transfer of over thirty percent can be provided. Inasmuch as the coefficient of performance on this cycle in cooling without the energy transfer is about 0.7, a thirty percent reduction of input requirements increases the cooling coefficient of performance to one and the heating coefficient of performance to two. Because there is a time and temperature lag between the heat input and equalization of temperature in the actual zeolite container, the increase of coefficient of performance is, in fact, higher. Further, by designing the heat transfer conduit so that a heat front is propagated through the zeolite of the converter, the improvement is considerably enhanced. The theoretical temperatures for such system employing a heat front are illustrated in Fig. 6. However, the actual temperatures attained conform more nearly to those temperature time profiles indicated in Fig. 16. Referring to Figs. 9 through 13, it will be seen converters 120 and 121 can be placed in a single cylindrical container 134 which is suitably insulated and has an insulated divider 135. Fluid conduits 125 for the passage of heat transfer fluid are intentionally formed from a thin metal of low thermal conductivity. Received on each conduit 125 is a tile or pack 136 comprising a thin layer of zeolite enclosed in a high thermal conductivity material such as copper foil. Each packet 136 has the form of a flattened toroid only a few millimeters thick, which on its bottom is provided with a plurality of outwardly extending protrusions 137 or dimples and on its top side as shown in Fig. 13, a plurality of openings 140. The purpose of protrusions 137 or dimples is to provide spacing and resilience between individual packets 136. The hole 141 in packet 136 is dimensioned so as to fit tightly on conduit 125 to maximize thermal conduction between conduit 125 and the copper portion of packet 136 which contains a thin layer of zeolite, so heat which is delivered by the heat transfer fluid travelling through conduit 125 is quickly conducted to the zeolite in packet 136 via the surrounding copper foil. For example, the packets 136 can be installed on conduits 125 after the latter have had their temperature reduced so that upon expanding, a tight fit is accomplished. If desired, conduits 125 can be threaded to provide alternating thin and thicker grooves along their outer peripheries which are received tightly by corresponding grooves on the interior periphery of packet 136 defining 141. The purpose of the foregoing structure is to create a propagating temperature front in the zeolite along each of the conduits 125. Thus the heat exchanger which comprises conduits 125 in each converter 120 and 121 has a plurality of nesting and contacting packets 136 from top to bottom and its heat transfer coefficient from the heat transfer fluid to the zeolite is larger than the conductivity along the path of the heat transfer fluid, the thermal conductivity along the conduit 125 being relatively low. The specific heat of the heat transfer fluid is also relatively low compared to the heat capacity of the zeolite augmented by desorption. As a result, a temperature front is created in the zeolite layer. The temperature front moves slowly along the length of the conduit 125 whereby in the generating converter the bottom zeolite packets are desorbed first and the corresponding layers of packets 136 which have been desorbed moves upwardly in the direction of the heat flow. Similarly, in the adsorbing converter a front in adsorbing packets 136 will move, again in the direction of the heat transfer fluid flow, downwardly. With such heat exchange, the output temperature profile over time for the converters when in the generator mode and the adsorber mode is shown in Fig. 6. In this manner, more than sixty percent of the thermal energy from the adsorber can be exchanged and the coefficient of performance of the system approaches that of theoretical Carnot efficiency. The solution to the heat diffusion equation for the metal zeolite innerface and in the zeolite thereafter is represented by the following equation Due to the non linearity of the adsorption isotherms for zeolite, condenser temperatures may, if desired, be increased without causing a reduction in the capacity of the unit more than would exist were conventional adsorption or absorption systems utilized and, in fact, the reduction in capacity is less. Inasmuch as in the heating mode, there is a considerable amount of energy available in the converter in the adsorber mode at 160 F 71 C and below, it is advantageous to keep the condenser at about 100 F 38 C and use it to preheat the load fluid with a further increase in its temperature to about 160 F 71 C by heat from the converter in the adsorber mode. When cooling, the condenser is cooled indirectly by ambient air or in a heat sink or the like, and the variation with air temperature of capacity is small. As previously indicated, specific embodiments for the invention can be varied considerably depending upon the heating and cooling demands which are placed on the system. An embodiment is shown in Fig. 9 wherein the converters are in a single unit which can be installed in an existing building and connected with an existing system in lieu of the furnace or air conditioner already installed. The container 134 for the units 120 and 121 is essentially an insulated tank having a structural capacity for a high interior vacuum which, in an operation wherein the refrigerant is water, may be five millimeters of mercury or less. The container 134 contains two energy converters 120 and 121, each energy converter having, in effect, three heat exchange means which comprise the fluid conduits 125, the condenser 122 and the evaporator 124. Although each heat exchange means is shown as having a single pass, it will be appreciated they may be double pass or more. Also the heat exchangers are shown as having straight tubes whereby, in practice, helical wound tubes may be utilized or plate type heat exchangers may be substituted. Further, the same heat exchanger may be utilized for both the condenser and evaporator. As a matter of practice, double pass heat exchangers are advantageous for the condenser and evaporator because they permit connections into container 134 only on one side. Further, although a divider 135 divides container 134 into two different hermetically sealed spaces 133 wherein the refrigerant is received it will be appreciated that a divider may also be utilized to provide any number of such spaces which are pie shaped as seen in plan. Thus, a single container 134 may be used for three converters, four converters or, within structural limits, any number desired. When single pass units are involved, they may be inclined within container 134 as suggested by the disposition of parts in Fig. 8 so that if a pump is not operable to provide forced circulation of the cooling and heating water flowing through the condenser or evaporator, it can occur in any event due to natural circulation of the system. Otherwise, ice may form in the evaporator or steam may be generated in the condenser. Flue and bottom conduits 126, 127, 131 and 132 for the air and combustion gases are each connected with their respective internal conduits 125 via an atrium 142 Fig. 9 . It will be understood such flue and bottom conduits and atriums together with the fluid conduits 125 are hermetically sealed from the space 133 within container 134 which contains the zeolite packets 136 and the refrigerant which, in the preferred embodiment, is water vapor. A barrier 144 is provided in each converter 120 and 121 to divide the zeolite and conduits 125 from the condenser 122 and evaporator 124. Such barrier has a pocket formed on each side thereof whereby the condensed water is received, the pocket surrounding the cooling water tubes 146 of evaporator 124. Each condenser and evaporator is provided with such heat exchange tubes 146 which connect on the inboard side of further atriums 145 which on their outboard sides are provided with connections 147 to receive heating or cooling heat transfer fluid, as appropriate to provide heating or cooling. Separate from container 134 is a heating station 130 which is preferably an insulated box shaped combustion chamber 150 into which is inserted heating means comprising a gas burner 151. As previously described, gas burner 151 can, if desired, be a fuel oil burner, an engine exhaust outlet or a heat exchanger from, for example, a solar heating unit or a geothermal fluid source. Station 130 has two outlets 131a and 127a for connection to bottom conduits 131 and 127 respectively as seen, for example in Fig. 3. Burner 151 is provided with, of course, conventional safety devices including a pilot light and a solenoid cut off valve in the event of failure of gas pressure whereby the pilot light is extinguished. Further, burner 151 may be utilized by being directed either towards outlet 131a or 127a to include air movement through the air and combustion gases conduits when air is the heat transfer fluid. However, preferably the direction of air movement is accomplished by energizing one of two electrically driven fans 152 which respectively connected with conduits 132 and 126. By this means, air is drawn through the fluid passageways and in the event any of the conduits for the air and combustion gases leak, then the leakage is from rather than into the area wherein the system is located. A single reversible fan may be utilized on either one of the conduits 132 and 126 in lieu of two fans 152. In this connection, it should be understood the flow of air whether caused by one fan or two fans is preferably about thirty times that required to sustain combustion of fuel from gas burner 151. Thus the chances of such combustion posing a danger to the occupants of a building wherein the system is installed is practically nonexistent. Referring again to Fig. 8 a simplified system for heating and cooling by means of the above described operation is shown. Circulating pumps 154 and 155 are employed in water conduit circuits 156 and 157 respectively. Circuit 156 contains one or more heating elements 160 and circuit 157 contains one or more cooling elements 161. A thermal dissipation element 162 is contained in a conduit circuit 164 which can be connected selectively to either circuit 156 or circuit 157 so that either part or all of the circulating water destined for either heat element 160 or cooling element 161 can be dissipated to the outside or to a heat sink or the like. Valves 165 immediately after connections 147 in circuits 156 and 157 may be solenoid valves or pressure operated valves which are controlled by temperature sensors at conduits 126, 127, 131 and 132 or by pressure sensors internal to converters 120 and 121. Fans 152 are controlled by the controls for burner 151 and the particular fan to be running at any given part of the cycle is controlled by temperature sensors located in outlets 126, 127, 131 and 132 or alternatively by internal temperature or pressures, sensors in converters 120 and 121. Burner 151 may be controlled simply by a room thermostat which contains or is responsive to elements 160 and 161. It may also be connected to sensors at outlet 126, 127, 131 and 132 whereby, with the thermostat opened, the cycle is nevertheless continued until the adsorber output temperature crosses with the generator output temperature as shown in Fig. 6. Sensors as indicated above may also be employed to dictate, when the system is started which fan will start first by detecting which converter has the highest temperature. In operation, when converter 120 is heated, refrigerant gas is expelled from the zeolite therein and condensed by condenser 122 which thereby heats the water circulated by pump 154 in circuit 156. Fan 152 for conduit 132 draws air through passageways 125, such air being preheated at station 130 by burner 151. A heat front is created in the zeolite packets 136 starting at the bottom and working towards the top in successive packets which are received around the conduits 125 and when such front reaches its highest point whereby the zeolite in converter 120 has desorbed all but eight percent by weight of its water, the temperature in conduit 132 increases quickly to 400 F 205 C thereby causing fan 152 in circuit 132 to cease operating and fan 152 in circuit 126 to commence drawing air into conduit 132 through conduits 125 in converter 120 and out of such converter via conduit 131 into combustion chamber 150. There it is heated by the flame from burner 151 and, as heated, continues through conduit 127 into passageways 125 of converter 121 and out of conduit 126. After passing through fan 152 it is exhausted into the atmosphere. The same part of the cycle previously described for converter 120 now takes place in converter 121 and air being drawn through converter 120 cools the zeolite therein by a cold front which moves downwardly. The vapor condensed into water by condenser 122 commences to boil and is evaporated in evaporator 124 into space 133 because, as the temperature of the zeolite is lowered, it commences to adsorb water vapor and also because the pressure in converter 120 is lowered. This evaporation in evaporator 124 at the lower temperature takes place at about 8 C or 47 F. However, the adsorption of the water vapor into the zeolite heats the zeolite by means of the heat of adsorption. The heat of adsorption together with the heat source provided by the higher temperature of the zeolite and other internal structure heats the air passing through the conduits 125 while, at the same time, cooling the zeolite and other structure. A thermal front drops through the zeolite as previously described and the heated air is transferred via conduit 131 to combustion chamber 150 thus preheating and preserving the heat of adsorption as well as that due to the specific heat of other elements in the converter 120. The ultimate result is a much higher coefficient of performance than would otherwise be obtainable. During this part of the cycle, cooling water is caused by pump 155 to circulated through circuit 157 and such cooled water may be utilized for cooling purposes in the cooling season or for other cooling purposes for example, cooling a food storage room or dissipated as required. Because of the possibility that the temperature in the evaporator 124 may drop below freezing during the heating season, such water may have antifreeze or the like added thereto to ensure it is not frozen. Fig. 14 is a diagram similar to Fig. 3 which is, however, a more complete representation of the zeolite gas fired pump in the heating mode. In additions an indication of typical temperature to be experienced during heating operations is set forth in Fig. 14. Combustion air enters from the outside into the conduit 126 at a temperature which in the heating season is typically between 17 F or 47 F 8 C to 8 C . This air is preheated by a flue heat exchanger 170 to about 95 F 35 C . Such heat exchangers are well known in the art and therefore will not be described in detail. An example is the Dolin Heat Reclaimer manufactured by Stacor Corporation of Newark, New Jersey. Such air passes through a further heat exchanger 172 which, for the part of the cycle indicated in the Figure, is inactive. The combustion air continues into the converter 121, passing through the conduits 125. The generator 121 is in the adsorber phase and is being cooled from its prior generator phase during which it reached 400 F 205 C . Converter 121 slowly cools and continuously adsorbs refrigerant vapor from its evaporator 125 at a temperature which is typically, again, between 17 F and 47 F 8 C to 8 C . The generated heat of adsorption plus the specific heat of the zeolite and other container structure heat the outside combustion air heat transfer fluid flowing through conduits 125 to between 100 F 38 C and 400 F 205 C . With the air to zeolite heat exchanger comprising packets 136 stacked on conduits 125, the output temperature of the air and combustion gases from conduits 125 is maintained at about 400 F 205 C for almost the entire adsorption part of the cycle. By thermostatic or other appropriate well known controls, the combustion air leaving converter 121 via conduit 127 is heated at heating station 130 to about 400 F. Such air is then conveyed by conduit 131 into the converter 120 wherein the zeolite is about 95 F 35 C which it reached in its prior adsorber phase. Now with converter 120 in the generator phase, the temperature of the zeolite is increased via the propagating temperature front to about 400 F 205 C . As soon as some of the zeolite in converter 120 is heated to above about 160 F 71 C , refrigerant gas is desorbed and the pressure increase is sufficient for the gas to condense at 100 F 38 C , the heat of condensation in the converter s condenser 122 being used to provide the heating load. Combustion gases leave converter 120 at about 160 F 71 C at the beginning of the generation cycle, but their temperature increases rapidly to about 400 F 205 C where it remains until the end of the cycle. During the heating season, these gases are cooled in heat exchanger 171 to about 100 F 38 C . Heat exchanger 172 may be utilized in conjunction with condenser 122 for the heating load or as a preheater for hot water and other heating purposes. It will, of course, be understood the entire heating load of the building may be furnished by the condenser 122 and heat exchanger 171 when converter 120 is in the generator phase. In a like manner, converter 121 may be used together with its condenser 122 and heat exchanger 172 to provide heat for the entire heating load of the building when it is in the generator phase. Thus, the fluid circulated through heat exchangers 171 and 172 which is heated for the purpose of the overall heating load is switched alternately between such heat exchangers in the same manner as accomplished for condensers 122 and evaporators 124. Finally, gases leaving heat exchanger 171, 172 are further cooled in the flue heat exchanger 170 and exhausted to the outside air in a temperature range which is typically in the range of 22 F to 52 F 6 C to 11 C . Heat carried away from the evaporators 124 is typically dissipated in element 162. It is not, however, unusual for larger buildings to require both heating and air conditioning at the same time due to the location of the sun and other factors. Thus it is possible by using the instant invention with an appropriate plumbing arrangement both to heat and cool simultaneously. After the described portion of the cycle is completed, the process is reversed and the direction of air flow through the heating station 130 is also reversed. The cycle is repeated as described above with condensers and evaporators also being interchanged. The coefficient of performance of the heat pump described above and disclosed in Fig. 14 is theoretically about three for the heating mode where the evaporator temperature is 17 F 8 C and the condenser temperature is 100 F 38 C for a load of 160 F 71 C . In practice, of course, the coefficient of performance is less. But with proper design is nevertheless within about eighty percent of the theoretical value, that is, about 2.4. The time of each cycle depends upon the size of the unit. With the proper design, in theory it could be short as two and one half minutes. However, to ensure that the materials, particularly conduits 125, are sufficiently strong and durable, as a matter of practice, the cycling time is fifteen to thirty minutes. With the zeolite temperature range being from 100 F to 400 F 38 C to 205 C , it desorbs about fifteen percent by weight of water vapor and each pound of zeolite produces about 150 BTUs 1.6 x 10⁵ joules of cooling when the 0.15 pounds of water is condensed and evaporated during a cycle. Thus with fifteen minute cycling, 600 BTUs 6.3 x 10⁶ joules per hour of cooling are provided per pound of zeolite. For one ton of air conditioning, that is, 12,000 BTUs 1.3 x 10⁷ joules per hour, twenty pounds of zeolite are therefore necessary. It is advantageous that the zeolite in packets 136 be composed of thin slices of natural deposit zeolite which are only a few millimeters thick. Each zeolite slice is then inserted into a corresponding packet 136 made of thin copper foil. When the surrounding packet 136 is then evacuated, the copper foil is brought into close contact with the zeolite slice to provide a good thermal conduction for the thermal cycling without a need for binders. The end product, which is essentially the container 134 with the converters 120 and 121 installed together with the combustion chamber 150 and gas burner 151, is an adsorbent heat pump having a cooling coefficient of performance of between one and two and a heating coefficient of performance between two and three. The weight of the unit is somewhat less than eighty pounds for each ton of cooling and its price is competitive with or less than that of existing electrically driven heat pumps for each ton of cooling. For most areas, the operating costs are significantly less. Moreover, both in initial cost and in operating and maintenance costs for the unit is substantially less than the combination of electrical air conditioning and a gas furnace. This advantage is expected to continue even if an increase in gas prices occurs to the extent that the heating and cooling costs for a building will be reduced despite the increased gas prices. The system is particularly attractive for the central and northeastern parts of the United States where annual heating costs of over 1,000 are sufficient to justify the replacement of existing systems with a repayment period of about two years without considering tax credits. It will be noted the system does not utilize inside air for combustion as is frequently the case with conventional gas furnaces. Although the circulation of air may occur or be provided by other means including diffusion and intentional circulation of interior air to the outside and vice versa, the inevitable loss due to the forced infusion of air which results from a conventional furnace is thus eliminated by the invention. In Fig. 15 various lengths of heat exchangers are compared to show the temperature increase which occurs for various effective lengths of the heat exchangers in terms of time. It will be noted that the shorter the heat exchanger, the more rapidly the temperature rises. Fig. 15 together with Fig. 16 are important for the purpose of showing the actual efficiency of energy recycled between the two containers. Thus Fig. 16 discloses the reduction of temperature in one of the containers while the temperature in the other container is increasing. Fig. 16 together with Fig. 15 indicate a seventy percent recycling of energy between the two container. In generating the data shown in these figures, the normalized temperatures for gas were 100 F, 400 F 33 C to 205 C for the gaseous fluids and 25 C for the liquid fluid. Fig. 17 discloses the measured performance of different thicknesses of zeolite when immersed initially in a well stirred liquid bath with a temperature differential of 100 C. Thicknesses ranging from three millimeters to 16.5 millimeters were tested. Such results indicate that a cycling time of three to four times per hour is not only feasible but also can be achieved with zeolite samples in thicknesses up to one quarter inch thick or about six millimeters. However, it is important that the thermal flows into and from the zeolite be from both sides of the envelope so that the effective thermal path is reduced considerably. A zeolite heat exchanger unit 183 found advantageous is shown in Fig. 18. This may be substituted for packets 136 and conduits 125 as shown in Fig. 9 with channels 182 and 184 being in fluid passage communication with the hermetically sealed space 133 through which refrigerant flows. This type of envelope was utilized for the test which produced the results shown in Fig. 17. Zeolite bricks 180 are enclosed in a copper foil envelope 181 which includes a plurality of fins 182 which also form corrugated channels in the copper foil. The zeolite 180 also has a plurality of channels 184 and water vapor or other fluid flows readily through channels 182 and 184. Flue gases flow around foils 181. Foils 181 are sealed around their edges 185, such seal forming a further fin and on the inside a further channel 186. The zeolite heat exchanger means 120 and 121 may thus be constructed of a number of units 183 either in parallel as illustrated in Fig. 19 or in series as illustrated in Fig. 20. The final configuration is determined by the size and capacity of the cooling unit. Typically, a one ton cooling capacity unit having twenty pounds of zeolite is cycled four times per hour between 100 F and 400 F 38 C to 205 C and heat exchanger units 183 consist of three millimeter zeolite bricks 180 in thin copper envelopes. For maximum heat exchange effectiveness this produces a packing density of heat exchanger 120 of about 0.5 pounds of zeolite per square foot of heat exchanger. Therefore the total area of the heat exchanger is forty square feet which may be divided between the two containers 120. Air flow velocity for the gaseous heat transfer fluid is ten feet per second which provides a heat transfer coefficient to the copper envelope of 3 BTU sq.ft hr. F. To increase this coefficient, as indicated, the copper foil is provided with corrugated channels 182 which act as fins to increase the surface area of the heat exchange and simultaneously to function as channels through which the water vapor travels. As shown in Fig. 18, the zeolite brick 180 is provided with channels 184 for vapor travel. This, however, reduces the contact area between the zeolite and the copper and therefore the heat flow to a certain degree. Zeolite bricks 180, as such, have been prepared by two separate methods. The first is by slicing natural zeolite rock with a carbide saw. A second method is by pressing powdered zeolite in a die. In the pressing, zeolite powder is slightly wetted with water and then pressed to the desired configuration at pressures of up to about one hundred, forty kilograms per square centimeter to produce a brick which dry has a density of about 0.8 grams per cubic centimeter. It has been found that these measures are required to produce high thermal conductivity and heat flow in the zeolite and therefore are important for a successful system. Zeolite bricks 180 are preferably not more than about ten millimeters in thickness. With laminar flow of oils, the Biot number is less than that with any flow of gases. Further, calculations predict a sharper temperature front and therefore eventually a higher system efficiency with a liquid flow vis a vis gaseous flow. These calculations have been confirmed by experimental observation of thermal front propagation. In an embodiment using oil as the zeolite condenser evaporator heat exchange fluid, water is retained as the working medium, that is the refrigerant, in preference to other refrigerants such as ammonia, alcohols and freons. Water has the highest heat of vaporization of candidate refrigerants and, in addition, is stable at 400 F 205 C in zeolites. Although COP may be shown as a function of zeolite and condenser temperatures, the evaporator temperature influences COP more than the condenser temperature. Because of their non linearity, zeolites operate in systems with air cooled condensers without any significant loss in performance. Natural zeolites have been found superior to synthetic ones, especially at the lower temperatures between 200 F and 350 F 92 C to 175 C . However, their superiority reduces significantly at 400 F 205 C . As indicated above, the provision of a relatively sharp temperature front in the zeolite increases the efficiency of the system and, on the basis of both theory and experiment, liquid rather than gaseous fluid provides a sharper front in the zeolite. Experiment and theory agree that with a front moving alternatively in one direction and then back in the other direction, an advantageous cost effective length for a heat exchanger is about thirty six feet 11 meters inasmuch as increases in COP begin to reduce after this length. A close, but somewhat longer length of forty three feet 13 meters has been selected for the heat exchanger with the zeolite in the embodiment under consideration. The theoretically predicted temperature front width is about 60 of the total length for a heat exchanger length of thirty five feet 10.7 meters If the heat exchanger length is forty feet 12.2 meters , then the front width is 59 and for a forty five foot 13.7 meters length of heat exchanger it is 58 . For a thirty six foot 11 meters heat exchanger, about 75 of the energy can be recycled to increase the cycle COP to 2.0. If maximum COP was the only consideration, then, of course, the longer the heat exchanger, the better. However, for similar designs, the cost per unit length of heat exchangers and the cost of associated equipment also increase and because of this trade off, about thirty five 10.6 meters to about sixty feet 18.3 meters is considered optimum for the length of the liquid zeolite heat exchanger. The heat exchanger using a liquid fluid incorporates natural zeolite from Bowie, Arizona that is capable of desorbing 15 by weight of water vapor which, when condensed in the evaporator, produces 12,000 BTUs 1.3 x 10⁷ joules of cooling. Such zeolite which is about 1 4 thick, actually six millimeters, using the thin copper material for heat exchange purposes, has a timed constant on desorption of 3.5 minutes and desorbs better than 95 of the equilibrium water vapor in ten minutes or less. Although 1 4 6 mm thickness is desirable because of the integrity of the zeolite, a thinner zeolite can be used if it is desired to reduce the time constant on desorption. A square foot of zeolite tile 1 4 6 mm thick weighs about 1.3 pounds including the adsorbed water. Flat tile geometry for the zeolite is preferred inasmuch as with atmospheric pressure on one side of the copper foil against the zeolite tile which is in vacuum, good thermal contact and heat transfer from the fluid to the zeolite is ensured irrespective of the constant cycling in temperature and differences of thermal expansion coefficients between copper and zeolite. For low cost and simplicity of manufacturing, the design shown in Fig. 21 has been selected. Here the copper foil duct 194, wherein the foil is about .35 millimeters thick within a preferred range of .2 to .5 millimeters, is folded in two and the edges 192 are welded together to form the equivalent of a flat pipe or duct 194 about one foot 30.5 cm in width and up to about forty five feet 13.7 meters long. Duct 194 is formed with 180 bends 195 every foot to provide a serpentine structure with 1 4 thick 12 x 12 6 mm x 30.5 cm x 30.5 cm zeolite tiles between the serpentine turns from alternating sides to form a stack 196 which, because the duct 194 is about 1 8 3 mm in thickness, is roughly 13 wide x 12 deep by 16 high 33 cm x 30.5 cm. x 40.6 cm . In this embodiment the length of duct 194 is roughly forty three feet 13 meters inasmuch as there is one more layer of duct than zeolite tiles 190 and the turns in the duct s serpentine configuration must be accounted for. To reduce duct 194 without reducing the capacity of the zeolite tiles to adsorb and desorb water vapor preferably the depth of the duct and the zeolite tiles perpendicular to the direction of the duct should be increased and the width may be correspondingly decreased. If sufficiently increased, the capacity of stack 196 for heating and cooling is increased. Preferably the copper foil of duct 194 is sealed at edge 192 by electron beam welding in a manner comparable to the method widely used in the copper tubing industry. Other means are, of course, known as ultrasonic welding and brazing silver soldering . Zeolite tiles 190 may be pressed from zeolite powder with the proper binders and lubricants. Slicing of natural rock zeolite is also known to produce operable zeolite tiles. There need not be only one tile for each layer. For example, four 6 x 6 15 cm x 15 cm tiles may be used in the place of a single one foot square 929 cm² tile. Smaller tiles have the advantage of providing additional surfaces and channels through which water vapor may be adsorbed and desorbed from the tiles. To avoid crumbling, the zeolite tile may be provided with copper frames or pressed into copper honeycomb type cores. In addition, because the copper in duct 194, when vacuum is applied to the zeolite tiles, conforms itself to the contours of the surface which it engages, with the tiles properly shaped and disposed relative to each other at each level, grooves are formed by the vacuum applied to the zeolite tiles in the copper foil which both strengthen the duct and increase the effective foil to zeolite surface engagement. This can be further increased by creating channels in the zeolite tiles 190 when they are pressed or by providing grooves on the surfaces of natural rock zeolite. Such channels or grooves, if sufficiently deep, serve the purpose of both strengthening the adjacent engaging copper foil and enhancing vapor transport from and to the tile. Moreover, because the grooves, however formed, are only in the transverse parallel flat portions of the copper foil, the portions comprising bends 195 are not affected. The forming of bends 195, in manufacture, without collapsing when the 180 bends are formed, is accomplished by filling duct 195 with Cerobend alloy which melts at 158 F 70 C , before bending. The bend is thereby accomplished as though a solid metal plate is involved and the alloy is subsequently melted, recovered and reused for further manufacturing operations. Alternatively, the duct may be filled with sand before bending or may be bent under hydraulic pressure and the problems involved are not greatly different than those utilized to bend copper tubing without collapsing the walls. Using a 1 8 3 millimeter spacing between the top and bottom of the copper foils of duct 194 results in the volume of each heat exchanger or stack 196 being about three gallons. Because of the high viscosity of most high temperature oils which may be used for this purpose, reducing the space between the foils to less than 1 8 of a inch 3 mm substantially increases the pressure drop across each stack 196. With, however, the 1 8 3 mm spacing the pressure drop, using high temperature oil with a maximum viscosity of five to ten centistokes, does not exceed about five psi 3 x 10⁴ pascals across stack 196. High temperature oils practicable for the heat exchange fluid are well within the skill of the art. An example is Therminol 60 which has a viscosity of five centistokes cm² sec at 100 F 38 C , two at 200 F 92 C and an operating temperature up to 600 F 315 C . Stack 196 is housed in an air tight container 200. As in previous embodiments and as shown in Fig. 22, there are two containers 200, each of which has conduits 201 and 202 for a sealed flow passage to the upper channel and lower channel respectively of duct 194. Each container 200 is generally cylindrical in shape and of such size and configuration internally to restrict stack 196 in a vertical direction whereby it does not expand when air is evacuated from container 200 and it contains water vapor at low atmospheric pressure. Conduits 201 contain a reversible pump 204 which is preferably a gear pump to ensure that the flow rate remains constant even though the viscosity of the high temperature oil which it causes to flow through conduits 201, duct 194, conduits 202, and a boiler 205, changes viscosity by almost an order of magnitude. Also, of course, it is necessary that the flow of the oil be reversed each cycle with the least complications. The gear pump involved has an operating temperature of at least 200 F 92 C and is connected to a variable speed reversible motor of 1 8th or 1 4th 93 or 186 joule sec horsepower capacity. The combination is capable of pumping up to two gallons per minute at twenty pounds per square inch pressure 7.5 x 10 In this embodiment, each container 200 does double duty as a condenser and an evaporator by alternately cooling and heating the vertical wall of its cylindrical shape. A preferred embodiment is shown in Fig. 23 wherein the wall which is copper is corrugated with a continuous helical groove 206 which, in turn, receives copper tubing 207. It will be appreciated that the corrugations increase the strength of container 200. Fig. 24 illustrates an alternative arrangement. Here a container 200a, again composed of copper, is embossed with a pattern of channels 206a and a corresponding outer shell 210 is also embossed with internal channels 206b. Container 200a has shell 210 welded thereto in such a manner that the embossed channels 206a and 206b define a helical flow pattern which is used to receive the heat exchange medium. Otherwise container 200a is the same as container 200. The purpose of boiler 205 is to increase the temperature of the oil passing therethrough to 400 F. Preferably boiler 205 is gas fired and may be any of a large number of boilers designed for this purpose. It may be heated by any known energy source for this purpose including engine exhausts, geothermal sources, and solar energy either to supply part or all of the needed thermal energy required for the system to operate. In this embodiment, there are three hermatically sealed contiguous spaces which are isolated from each other. The innermost comprises the interior of duct 196, contiguous conduits 201 and 202 and the flow passages through pump 204 and boiler 205. Such space is completely filled with high temperature oil. The second sealed space actually two separate spaces is the interior of each container 200, which is exposed to the zeolite which, in turn, adsorbs and desorbs water vapor in the containers at sub atmospheric pressures as previously discussed with reference to Fig. 4, that is, between about nine and fifty millimeters of mercury. The third contiguous space is defined by the copper tubing 207, or the passages defined by channels 206 and 207 in container 200a, and the conduits therefrom which form the heating and cooling loops. This space is normally filled with water. Referring to Fig. 28, it will be noted that the loops for exterior water include lower conduits 214 and upper conduits 215 which respectively connect on lower and upper ends of condenser evaporator coiled tubes 207 of each container 200. Both upper conduits 215 connect to a double channel two way valve 212 and a similar valve 212 connects the lower conduits 214. Valves 212 are controlled by solenoids not shown alternatively to connect one of the containers 200, acting via its tubes 207 as a condenser, to heater 216 and the other container 200, via its tubes 207 when acting as an evaporator, to cooler 217. Heater 216 and cooler 217 contain coils for conveying the water received from conduits 214 and 215 which are subjected to air flow from fan 220 so that, depending upon whether the building space is being heated or cooled, the air is either expelled to the atmosphere or circulated in the building. With individually controlled spaces in the building, some such spaces may be heated while others are cooled and, of course, heating elements may be employed with cooler 217 for increasing the temperature of cooled air from which the condensate has been removed, and for heating domestic water. The conduits leading to heater duct in Fig. 28 are designated by reference numeral 221 and those for the cooler loop through cooler 217 are designated by reference numeral 222. Pumps 211 have a capacity of five gallons 1.879 x 10 In operation, heated oil is drawn from boiler 205 at 400 F 205 C into one of the containers 200. The heated oil enters the bottom of duct 194, heating the adjacent zeolite tiles 190 as it proceeds through duct 194. Such tiles, upon being heated, desorb water vapor which raises the pressure in container 200. This water vapor is continually condensed by the cooling effect of water circulating in tubes 207 or channels 206b and, on condensing, transfers its thermal energy to the water in such tubes or channels which is circulated to heater 216, via conduits 215 and 221, wherein the thermal energy is removed and the water returns via pump 211 to continue the condensing process together with the heating of the circulating water. Because of the heat front which exists in the ribbon of oil as it flows up the serpentine path between the zeolite tiles 190, such tiles are heated from the bottom up and during the period of the cycle, water vapor continues to be desorbed from these zeolite tiles, to be condensed by water flowing through tubes 207 or channels 206b and to transfer thermal energy imparted to such water to heater 216. At the same time, pump 204 is moving oil cooled in the previous half cycle into the top of the other container 200 and stack 196 therein and, more specifically, into the top of duct 194. Here the zeolite tiles, having been previously heated and activated, are now in condition to adsorb water vapor in container 200. If desired, duct 201 may be selectively divertible through a heat exchanger such as heater 216. As the zeolite tiles 190 cool, pressure in container 200 reduces, vapor being adsorbed into the zeolite, and the previously condensed water therefore commences to be evaporated taking thermal energy from water flowing through the surrounding tubes 207 or channels 206b which passes via conduits 214, 215, valves 212, and conduits 22 to cooler 217 where the water is warmed and recirculated back to the tubes 207 or channels 206b surrounding container 200. As the cooling of zeolite tiles 190 continues in a downwardly direction, the cooling effect also continues. Heat of adsorption is of course largely retained due to the heat exchange from the zeolite tiles 190 to the oil. If desired, conduits 215 may include a spiral or undiluted form portion in the bottom of container 200 for an improved heat exchange relationship. Alternatively or in conjunction therewith, a return condensate line may be provided from the bottom of each container 200b as illustrated in Figs. 25 and 26 to enhance evaporation and adsorption in tiles 190. Here condensate in container 200b is received by gravity in sump 230. Such condensate, during the evaporation phase, is pumped by means of a peristaltic pump 231 through line 227 which passes through the wall of container 200b wherein it is received by a circular or partially circular ring manifold 232 to distribute same into a falling film on the inside wall of container 200b to enhance evaporation. Fig. 27 illustrates a cross over arrangement between containers 200c which are essentially identical to containers 200b. In this system, condensate in one container is caused by adsorption and thus a reduction of pressure in the other container to move therefrom via a cross over line 234 or 235. If desired, a float valve 236 or 237 may be installed in each sump 230 to ensure that the condensate alone is transported by the pressure differential and no equalization of pressures in the containers 200c takes place. This may be assured for normal operation conditions by the head of water which occurs in lines 234 and 235 in any event which may be enhanced by raising the relative height of lines 234 and 235. For maximum efficiency, the oil outlet temperature from each container 200 is retained at or under a relatively low temperature 200 300 F 92 to 149 C whereas for increased capacity its maximum permissible temperature is increased 300 400 F 149 to 205 C before the oil flow is reversed. Controls of pumps 204 and 211 and valves 212 as well as boiler 205 are thermostatically controlled. Although the preferred embodiments of the invention have been described, it is to be understood that it is capable of other adaptations and modifications. For example, instead of using heated air directly as a heat transfer fluid, a number of liquids such as silicon oils, glycols, and the like may be used as heat transfer fluids. As seen in Fig. 15, liquid provide sharper temperature fronts and therefore result in higher COPs. Furthermore, the energy to circulate a liquid is less than required for gases for the same amount of heat transferred, thus reducing parasitic electrical consumption.
