# SLIVER DETECTING DEVICE FOR DIVIDERS OF SPINNING CARDS

## Abstract
A device for checking the presence of slivers in carding machines and the like comprises a number of piezoelectric feeler units equal to the number of slivers to be checked, and on which said slivers are simply rested and slide during their movement, said feeler units converting the mechanical vibrations produced by the movement of the slivers on said units into oscillating electrical signals a switchable channel fed by said piezoelectric feeler units and conveying to a single output at different moments of time the signals which reach the channel at separate inputs a single signal amplifier tuned to the frequency range produced by the feeler units a selection circuit which chooses only one feeler unit at any given moment and connects it to the amplifier and an actuator circuit which integrates the signal originat ing from the amplifier and produces a stop signal and or activates alarm means if one or more of the signals originating from the feeler units are indicative of a broken or absent sliver.
