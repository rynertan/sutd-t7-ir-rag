# Corrosion resistant steel components and method of manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
To impart good salt spray corrosion resistance to alloy steel components, such components are gas nitro carburised at 550 C to 800 C to produce an epsilon layer, oxidised to produce an Fe₃O₄ layer not more than 1 micrometre thick, quenched into an oil water emulsion, degreased and then wax coated. The steel components may be surface finished after nitrocarburising. A carburizing, carbonitriding or neutral atmosphere heat treatment may be effected prior to nitro carburising heat treatment with both heat treatments being effected at above the pearlite to austenite transformation temperature.
