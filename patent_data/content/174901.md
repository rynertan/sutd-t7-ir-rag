# PISTOL ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
An assembly for converting an automatic pistol to a single shot gun, including a barrel structure 22 which is adapted to be detachably connected to the receiver 10 of the automatic pistol and which movably carries a slide 23 mounting a bolt 24 for front to rear movement relative to the barrel 16 . The barrel structure 22 has two rearwardly facing recoil shoulders 74, 79 engageable with spaced forwardly facing shoulders 34, 39 of the receiver 10 to transmit recoil forces from the barrel 22 to the receiver 10 , with one of the four shoulders being formed by an element which is threadedly adjustable to a condition assuring simultaneous engagement of both sets of shoulders. A safety element 25 is operable to control actuation of the firing pin by the hammer 19 of the gun, to prevent unintentional actuation of the firing pin by the hammer 19 , with the safety element 25 preferably being connected to the bolt 24 for swinging movement about an axis extending longitudinally of the barrel 16 , and with the safety element 25 also desirable being actuated automatically to a condi tion preventing firing of the gun upon pivotal movement of the bolt 24 from a condition of locked engagement with the barrel structure 22 to a released condition in which the bolt 24 can be retracted to open the rear of the barrel 16 . The bolt 24 may be constructed in a manner enabling a round to be slidably connected thereto in a retracted position of the bolt 24 , so that the bolt 24 can positively advance the round forwardly into the barrel 22 and positively withdraw the spend shell therefrom.
