# Method and apparatus for precisely controlling the angular velocity of an information storage disc.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for rotating an information stor age disc 11 about its central axis at a prescribed angular velocity that varies according to the radial position of an optical transducer 15 for recording information thereon, whereby a uniformly high density of information can be recorded over the entire disc. The apparatus includes a regis ter 21 for storing a digital measure of the radius of the current track being recorded by the transducer 15 , along with velocity signal circuitry for producing a disc velocity signal having a frequency inversely proportional to the measure of radius, and a spindle motor servo 25 responsive to the disc velocity signal, for controlling the angular velocity of the information disc 11 accordingly. The velocity signal circuitry includes a crystal oscillator 29 a counter 31 for counting the clock pulses produced by the oscillator, 29 and a digital word magnitude comparator 35 for generating a reset pulse to reset the counter 31 to an initial zero count every time it determines that the count is equal to the digital measure of radius. The disc velocity signal is then derived by frequency dividing the successive reset pulses.
