# Nuclear fuel rod bundle transfer apparatus.

## Abstract
Nuclear fuel rod bundle transferring apparatus which is remotely controlled 132 is disclosed for transferring a bundle of the rods along a path from a first container to a second container. The apparatus includes a set of rollers 106 includ ing means to permit variations of the distance between the axes of the rollers from a first distance sufficient to receive the bundle of fuel rods to a second distance less than said first distance, wherein the rollers engage opposing sides of the bundle of nuclear fuel rods 40 . A hatch 274 is disposable between a first position intercepting the path and retaining the bundle of fuel rods within the first container, and a second position permitting the bundle of nuclear fuel rods to be trans ferred from the first container to the second container.
