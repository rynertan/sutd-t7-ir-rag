# Matrix for supporting dental fillings during hardening thereof.

## Abstract
The cervical matrix in question is universal as each exemplar is suitable to be applied to a considerable number of teeth of different shape, therefore few ranges of matrices of different curvature for incisor, canine and molar teeth of adults and children suffice to cope with all the requirements. The matrix has a lamina 1 transparent to ultraviolet and luminous rays curved with a radius of curvature r less than that of the teeth to which it is applied. To the lamina is fixed a stem 2 which permits of grasping it with the forceps and pressing it against the tooth subjecting for a few seconds the whole to ultraviolet or visible irradiations to effect the beginning of the process of polymerization of the filling material after which the matrix is detached and the polyerization continued.
