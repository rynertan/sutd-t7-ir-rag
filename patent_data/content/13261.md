# Guaiacol esters of alpha and beta mercaptopropionylalanine and alpha and beta mercaptopropionylglycine, process for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing same.

## Abstract
Guaiacol esters of alpha and beta mercaptopropionyl alanine and of alpha and beta mercaptopropionyl glycine having formulae Pharmaceutical compositions containing these guaiacol esters have mucolytic activity. The process for manufacturing these guaiacol esters comprises preparing in a known per se manner a sulhydryl group containing intermediate wherein the sulfhydryl is pro tected by a trityl or p methoxybenzyl group, and removing the protective group under acid conditions.
