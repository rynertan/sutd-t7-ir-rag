## Description
This invention relates to the art of salt forming between therapeutically active pharmaceutical compounds and ion exchange resins. A pharmaceutical compound named cis 3 hydroxy 5 2 dimethylamino ethyl 2,3 dihydro 2 4 methoxyphenyl 1,5 benzothiazepin 4 5H one or cis 3 acetyloxy 5 2 dimethylamino ethyl 2,3 dihydro 2 4 methoxyphenyl 1,5 benzothiazepin 4 5H one is known, and the optically active isomers thereof are also known, like for instance the destrorotatory isomer cis 3 acetyloxy 5 2 dimethylamino ethyl 2,3 dihydro 2 4 methoxyphenyl 1,5 benzothiazepin 4 5H one, which is also called dilthiazen. One way to prepare compounds of this class is taught in JP A 44 102252 1969 to Tanabe Pharmaceutical Co.,Ltd. Dilthiazen is usually administered in the form of a soluble salt having a half life of 3 4 hours when at a therapheutical dosage repeated administrations are therefore necessary during the day in order to keep adequate blood levels. This drawback is an obstacle to a more wide and extensive use of the compound both because an administration that must be repeated every 3 or 4 hours is impractical, and because each administration is followed by a blood level peak giving rise to undesirable side effects. EP 27768 teaches a process to produce a resinate of febrifugine. However this process cannot be used to produce a dilthiazem resinate, since only an unstable resinate can be achieved. We have now surprisingly found that said drawbacks can be overcome by the invention as defined in claim 1. The invention comprises an orally administrable pharmaceutical compound giving delayed release of the therapeutically active component, comprising a cation exchange sulfonic type resin, characterized in that the acid groups of said resin are partly combined in the form of salts of said therapeutically active component cis 3 acetyloxy 5 2 dimethylamino ethyl 2,3 dihydro 2 4 methoxyphenyl 1,5 benzothiazepin 4 5 H one in that the acid groups that have not been converted to salts of the therapeutically active component are in the form of salts of alkali metals, or of alkaline earth metals, in that it comprises from 30 to 60 by weight of said therapeutically active component based on the weight of the product, and in that it comprises water that is buffered by means of a buffered solution having a pH of between 6 and 7. Dilthiazem is not very stable when in aqueous solution because the position 3 acetyl group shows a tendency to hydrolyze. We have surprisingly found that hydrolysis of said acetyl group does not occur during reaction with the cation exchange resin when operating under certain solvent, temperature and pH conditions. Favourable conditions to effect reaction with the resin are the use of an aqueous or alcoholic aqueous solvent at temperatures of between 0 C and 25 C and a pH range of between 5 and 7. The reaction medium pH can be controlled by the use of buffer solutions of a pH within said range. As a buffer use can be made of inorganic or organic acids, preferably acetic acid according to Walpole Walpole G.S.J. Chem. Soc., 105, 2501 1914 , sodium citrate according to Sorensen Sorensen,S.P.L. Biochem Z., 21, 131 1909 , or phosphates according to Sorensen Sorensen, S.P.L., Biochem Z., 22, 352 1909 . Cation exchange resins employed are the strongly acidic ones, e.g. the sulfonic resins. The latter, in fact, give a delayed release of the drug that is not hardly influenced by the pH and therefore remains substantially constant in the whole length of the gastro intestinal tract. Sulfonic resins that can be used are sulfonated styrene divinylbenzene copolymers or sulfonated polystyrene resins cross linked with divinylbenzene, commercially available under various trade marks, e.g. Amberlite trade mark of Rohm Haas , Dowex trade mark of Dow Chemical , or Zeo Karb trade mark of Permutit , but it is obvious that other commercially available resins having strongly acidic groups may be suited to prepare the instant products. The invention is not limited to a class of resins of a given cross linking and particle size Especially good results were obtained with Dowex resins of the type employed in the experimental section hereinafter. The invention has more especially as an object the afore defined resins, characterized in that only a part of their acid groups is in the form of salt of the therapeutically active compound, while the remaining acid groups are in the form of alkali or alkaline earth metal salts. By alkali metal it is preferably meant sodium or potassium. By alkaline earth metal is preferably meant calcium. Another object of the invention is the previously defined resins, characterized in that they contain from 30 to 60 by weight of the therapeutically active compound, and water buffered by a buffer solution comprising e.g. the above mentioned buffer solutions. Said buffer solution has preferably a pH of between 5 and 7. Total buffered water remaining enclosed within the resin is in the range of between 7 and 15 , based on the total preparation weight. More preferably, the employed buffer solution comprises a sodium buffered citric acid solution of a pH between 6 and 7. It was found in the practice that presence of the buffer solution within the resin is a critical item. In fact, only resins containing buffer solution and the active compound of the invention can be stored for the required time. On the contrary, in the absence of a buffer solution, the moisture in the resin consisting for instance just of distilled water, dilthiazem shows a tendency to degrade on standing and the preparation becomes industrially unpractical. The new compound is suitably produced through a procedure characterized in that a said resin is contacted, in its acid form, with an alcohol water solution of said therapeutically active component in its free base form, adopting such a ratio of resin to active component that from 10 to 50 of the resin ionic groups become bound on the form of a salt at a temperature of between 20 and 25 C, said alcohol water solution including water and an alcohol selected from methanol, ethanol and isopropanol in the ratio of one part of water to three parts of alcohol b the remaining resin acidic groups are converted to salt through reaction with an alkali or alkaline earth metal cation salt c the obtained resin is washed with one of the aforementioned buffer solutions. Another way to prepare the new invention compound is contacting a sulfonic resin in its alkali or alkaline earth metal salt form with a salt of the therapeutically active compound in a buffered aqueous solution. Besides, the new compound can be suitably obtained by reacting a sulfonic resin whose acid groups have been converted to the form of salts of cis 3 hydroxy 5 2 dimethylamino ethyl 2,3 dihydro 2 4 methoxyphenyl 1,5 benzothiazepin 4 5H one, and possibly also salts of an alkali or alkaline earth metal with acetic acid anhydride or other acetic acid derivative at a temperature of between room temperature and 80 C, finally washing the resin with one of the aforementioned buffer solutions. The new compound dilthiazem resinate has a gradual release in the intestine achieving the gradual onset of the pharmacological effects which further are long lasting. This is confirmed by the coronaro dilating activity inhibition of coronar artery spasm induced by vasopression P in Guineapigs, Table 1 . Further dilthiazem resinate has a toxicity which is decidedly lower than dilthiazem chlorhydrate Table 2 . This invention has also as an object pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one of the aforementioned drugs as an active principle. These compositions are preferably intended for oral use and can be in the form of powders, tablets, coated tablets, cachets, capsules, granules, emulsions or syrups.

One hundred thirty nine grams of Dowex 50W X4 H resin having a moisture content of 64 by weight, 50 grams dilthiazem in the free base form, and a mixture of 600mg alcohol and 200 ml water are stirred at 20 25 C for approximately 5 hours.
