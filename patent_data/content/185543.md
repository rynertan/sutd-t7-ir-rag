# THERMAL STABILIZATION OF ACETAL POLYMERS

## Abstract
The thermal stabilities of acetal polymers. e.g. oxymethylene oxyethylene copolymers, are improved by blending with a minor amount of an ionic salt of a low molecular weight copolymer of an alpha olefin and an alpha, beta ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, e.g. a calcium salt of an ethylene acrylic acid copolymer. The invention is particularly effective with pigmented acetal polymer com position.
