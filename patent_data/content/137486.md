# Apparatus for bending metal plate in widthwise direction.

## Abstract
A flat metal strip is placed horizontally on a base plate which is vertically movable between a ram and a bolster of a press. A bending die for bending the metal strip by applying pressure in the widthwise direction is fixed to a slide cam slidable horizontally on the base plate. The slide cam has a slide cam face abutting on a front cam face formed in a drive cam mounted on the bolster. When the ram is moved downwards, a cover plate fixed to the ram covers the metal strip, pushes the base plate and the slide cam downwards, and compels the slide cam to slide horizontally toward the metal strip with the aid of the front and slide cam faces to bend the metal strip with the bending die. On the other hand, the drive cam has a rear cam face abutting on a press cam face formed in a press cam fixed to the ram. Therefore, with the downward movement of the ram, the press cam compels the drive cam to slide horizontally toward the metal strip and push the slide cam in the same direction with the aid of the rear and press cam faces, so that the bending die is further moved forwards.
