# An electrical terminal and a zero insertion force electrical connector comprising such terminals.

## Abstract
An electrical terminal 10 has a spring beam part 31 anchored to a support 30 and from which extends a contact spring portion 12 having a contact surface 16 for engaging a conductor 52 of a circuit board 50 , upon a cam follower 40 being withdrawn from an abutment surface 14 of the contact spring portion 12 . The contact spring portion 12 is so formed that it is deflected by the cam follower 40 when it is applied to the abutment surface 14 , before the spring beam part 31 is deflected, and so that when the cam follower 40 is with drawn from the abutment surface 14 , the contact surface 16 wipes along the conductor 52 . A plurality of the terminals 10 may be incorporated in a zero insertion force circuit board edge connector.
