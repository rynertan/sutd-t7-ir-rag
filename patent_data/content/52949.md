## Description
A METHOD OF.SIZING..AND WEAVING HYDROPHOBIC YARNS AND SIZING COMPOSITION FOR USE THEREIN This invention relates to the sizing or dressing of yarns whether of spun or continuous filament type, to render them amenable to textile operations, for example, twisting, doubling, weaving, knitting, braiding and so forth. It is particularly concerned with sizes of the removable type which are adapted to be applied to hydrophobic yarns, such as polyester or nylon yarns, and especially yarns for use in water jet looms. Various water soluble or highly water zdispersible polymer colloidal substances, such as starch, polyvinyl alcohdl and acid r ich acrylic copolymers hdve bee n used for the sizing of yarns including moderately hydrophobic yarns such as nylon yarn, but such materials generally show insufficient adhesion to the more hydrophobic yarns such as polyes ter . Thi s lack of adhe sion requires the application of ex ces sive amounts of sizing material to protect the filaments or fibers or to compensate for the tendency for the size to rub off on guides and other surfaces of the textile fabricating machinery.A suitable polymeric size must not be so hard or brittle as to shed particles during passage through the textile fabricating machinery nor may it adhere to the metal in preference to the fiber or yarn and in this way lea d to deposits of size materials being left on metal drives or drying drums during the processing.Sizing of yarns for use in water jet looms presents particular problems because the shed opening on the looms is very small and electronic controls may be so fine that fuzzy yarns eitherMtransfer with the jets or tend to trip the stop motion in electronically cointrolled units which then stop the loom abruptly. The acrylic copolymer size bf the instant invention has excellent adhesion to a wide range of tVX T hydrophobic yarns and doe s not require extremely stringent drying conditions in order to develop good water res istance.De irate be ing highly hydrophobic, the polymer is readily removable with a mild alklaine scour and thus is an excellent warp size for yarns to be woven on a conventional shuttled or shuttless loom or preferably on a water jet loom. Additionally, the polymer is tack free in film form and, being a latex emulsion as prepared, is readily amenable to dilution and dries easily under moderate conditions to a water resistant tack free polymer. In one aspect the present invention provides a method of sizing hydrophobic yarns for weaving which comprises applying to the yarn an acidic latex of a free radical initiated vinyl polymer having a weight average molecular weight between about 300,000 and about 2,500,000. Said polymer, in dried film form1 is hydrophobic and is not redispersible in an aqueous solution at a low pH, such as from about 2 to about 5 or preferably even to 7, and is redispersible in an alkaline aqueous medium. The polymer is a polymer of monomers having a volume average solubility parameter S.P. between about 9.0 and about 9.5 the monomers comprising about 8 to about 14 a B ethylenically unsaturated acid.The glass transition temperature T of the polymer is between about 200C and 200C. g In other aspects the invention provides a method of weaving hydrophobic fibers which have been sized by the method described, the woven fabrics thus obtained, and the sizing compositions themselves. The polymer latex of the instant invention is made, preferably by a gradual addition thermal process, at about 30 to 60 solids following conventional emulsion polymerization procedures such as taught in the books entitledEmulsion Polymerization by D.C.Blackley Wiley, 1975 and by S.A.Bovey et al IntersciencePublishers, 1965 and Applications of SyntheticResin Emulsions by H.Warson E.Benn,Ltd., 1972 and Emulsion Polymerization of Acrylic Monomers Rohm and Haas Co.bulletin CM104A cf all herein incorporated by preference.The polymer is preferably a linear polymer free of crosslinks and branch points. In one desirable embodiment, the polymer is prepared from monomers consisting essentially of, by weight, 45 65 butyl acrylate, 28 45 styrene or methyl methacrylate or a mixture thereof, 8 14 acrylic acid or methacrylic acid or a mixture thereof preferably the monomers consist essentially of 50 608 butyl acrylate, 28 40 styrene and 10 13 acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. The polymer has a weight average molecular weight of from about 300,000 to about 2,500,000 with 500,000 to about 2,000,000 being preferred and 600,000 to 1,500,000 being most preferred. The polymer latex size forms a film on a hydrophobic yarn, preferably a polyester such as polyethylene terephalate or a nylon such as nylon 66, or nylon 6. The film has excellent adhesion and flexibility thus providing a hard, tough, protective film unaffected by the abrasive action of looms, particularly water jet looms, and by humidities up to 100 . The polymer is easily, removed by scouring with dilute aqueous solutions of alkaline materials. The hydrophobic yarn of this invention comprises fibers which exhibit moderate to little uptake of water upon immersion in water or exposure to high humidity. This property is often measured by adsorption of water by a. polymer film having a composition corresponding to that of the fiber or by the moisture regainoruptake of dehydrated fibers when held in an atmosphere of fixed relative humidity. Sources of such data are J. R. Scott and W. J. Roff, et al., Handbook of Common PolymersCRC Press, Cleveland, Ohio, 1971 E. Sutermeister, Chemistry of Pulp and Paper Making, John Wiley Sons,.New York, 1941 and the periodical Textile World, McGraw Hill Publications,Atlanta, Georgia.The following table is abstracted from the 1978 Textile World Man Made Fibers Chart, herein included by reference, on page 51 et seq. of the August 1978 Textile World.

H.The yarn of the present invention preferably comprises at least about 50 by weight of such hydrophobic fibers more preferably the yarn consists essentially of hydrophobic fibers and most preferably entirely of hydrophobic fibers, especially 100 polyester fibers, such as poly ethylene terephthalate , and 100 nylon fibers. The amount of copolymer applied to the textile material may vary from about 1 to about 20 by weight of yarn depending on the purpose for which the application is intended and on whether or not auxilliary conditioning or sizing agents are included in the composition when it is applied to the textile.The latex may be applied by spraying, dipping, padding, by sizing rolls, transfer rolls or the like An entire warp may be passed through a conventional slasher or a yarn may be individually treated in a single end sizer. The latex may have a concentration of ,l ,2,5 , by weight solids in the aqueous system and excess may be removed, such as by squeeze rolls or wipers, and the treated yarn may then be dried. Drying may be effected by any suitable means such as by heated air or drying cans. Drying may be effected at a wide range of temperatures such as 70 120 C.The aqueous latex may be applied at room temperature or at elevated temperatures such as up two about 800C. For warp sizing of spun yarns the preferred proportion qf polymer applied to the yarn is from 5 15 by weight of the initial weight of the yarn. For the sizing of continuous filament yarns, including water jet loom sizing, the preferred proportion is from about 1 to about 14 copolymer on the weight of the yarn. The higher amount of size is needed for fine low denier zero or low twist yarn. The copolymer of this invention may be applied to modify their properties and especially to render them more amenable to textile processing operation. Although not necessary, auxiliary materials may be incorporated into the latex such as surfactants or water dispersible lubricants, including sulfonated oils, self dispersible waxes, swelling or plasticizing agents for the yarn, etc. The article obtained, after application of the sizing composition to the yarn and drying, is essemlially free from the disadvantage of developing static charges and loss of sizing material by transfer to guides or by shedding. Surprisingly, the sizing material is readily removed by common scouring operations because of the ready solubility in aqueous alkaline medium despite its marked hydrophobicity, affinity for hydrophobic fibers and insolubility in acid medium. Even mildly alkaline scour solutions, such as 0.15 soda ash, are completely effective in removal of this polymer. Such mildly alkaline solutions may have a pH about 11. Various tests are employed to gauge the suitability of the polymer latex for use in sizing polyester yarn.The test methods are described below in the examples there are data comparing polymers of the instant invention with materials of the prior art and with examples of polymer latices outside the bounds of the instant invention. The adhesion of the Polymer to the yarn as measured by the Sand Tumble Test, described below, guages how well a yarn bundle will resist abrasion on the loom. Run under dry conditions the test relates to performance on a standard loom and run under wet conditions the test relates to performance on a water jet loom. A value of 50 is considered acceptable although 75 is preferred and values about 100 are most preferred. The Adhesion to Mylart Test is indicative of adhesion, especially to a polyester substrate since Mylar is a polyester substrate. The Crinkle Test gives the tendency of the polymer to flake from the substrate under flexing, thus simulating a yarn going over a roller or a guide. Flaking under such conditions would cause a weak spot in the yarn and thus lead to breaks in the yarn on the loom. The Scrape Test is to simulate the action at drop wires or a reed in the loom and also gives a gauge of the film toughness which property is required for runability in a mill. Water Resistance Tests measure a property needed for good performance in a water jet loom. Low water resistance is indicative of high swelling which leads to a markedly weaker film and thus to a weak sized yarn. The MoistureRegain measure, being at 95 relative humidity, additionally indicates the stability of the sized yarn to changes in ambient conditions such as seasonal or from dry day to humid day. Tak Test measures the ability of the sized and dried yarn to be rolled on a beam while warm and then be unrolled from the beam without sticking. Removability of the size is, of course, essential with the final test of removability from the sized yarn being most important. The size should be completely removable from the yarn. The polymer of the instant invention is applied to.the yarn in the form of a latex of particles usually about 0.07 to about 0.25 microns diameter, with 0.10 to 0.18 being pre i ferred and about 0.14, or a range within about 0.02 of that 1 value, being most preferred. Polymerization procedures useful, in producing polymers of the desired particle size and molecular weight are given in the books referred to above. This highly hydrophobic polymer composition is applied at acid, pH and is scoured at basic pH thus the polymer is intrinsically stronger, as a size, than a solution polymer would be in this application.The solution polymer would have to be at least partially neutralized to be in aqueous solution and thus would be highly swollen and weaker than the very hydrophobic latex polymer at low pH, of the instant invention. If attempts are made to .have the solution polymer be more hydrophobic, and thus marginally soluble, then the difficulty of scouring increases. A further advantage of utilizing a latex versus an alkaline solution or dispersion of a polymer is that less severe drying conditions are required for the latex, a particularly significant energy saving. Alternative embodiments of the instant invention may employ other ethylenically unsaturated monomers in the preparation of the polymer latex. .In alternative embodiments it is preferred that the acid content and identity be the same as in the above described embodiments aitho other ethylenically unsaturated acids, such as itaconic acid, may be used The acid level remains at 8t to 14 with 10 to i38 being preferred. Replacements for the butyl acrylate, styrene and methyl methacrylate are made on the basis that the range of glass transition temperatures, Tg , calculated for a high molecular weight polymer , and S. P. are to remain within the range implicit in the compositignal range for the embodiments taught above. Likewise preferred and more preferred are ranges of Tg and S. P. corresponding to the preferred and more preferred compositional ranges recited above. Polymer Handbook, 2nd Edition, J. Brandrup andE. H. Immergut, editors John Wiley Sons, New York, 1975 section IV, part 15, entitled Solubility Parameter Values by H.Burrell, on pages IV 33i to IV 359, herein incorporated by reference, defines S. P., describes how it is determined or calculated, contains tables of S. P. and gives further references to scientific literature on S. P. Table I on pages IV 341 to 344 lists the S. P. of solvents, including many monomers thereunder.In this specification numerical values of S. P. have the dimensions calories per cubic centimeter to the one half power, ise cal. cc. 0.5.The S. P. is the square root of the cohesive energy density which in turn is the numerical value of the potential energy of 1 cc of material, the potential resulting from the Van der Walls attraction forces between the molecules of a liquid or solid. Burrell describes a number of ways of calculating S. P. from experimentally determined physical constants and two ways of calculating them from. the structural formula of a molecule. The structural formula methods are normally used when the data for the calculation from physical constants are not available or are considered particularly unreliable. Calculation from the structural formula utilizes tables of group molar attraction constants such as those given on pages IV 339.The table of Small is preferred. The S. P. concept may be considered an extension of the old rule Like dissolves like. 11 recognized since the early days of chemistry. As tables of the solubility parameter of monomers are available, as noted above, it is convenient to define a polymer in terms of the solubility parameter of the monomers employed in its polymerization. The effective solubility parameter of a mixture is the sum, over the i components of the mixture, of the product of the volume fraction of the component vi times its S. P., i.e., S. P. mixture Vi S. P. i according to Scott and Magatt See Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology, Vol. 3,John Wiley, 1965, page 856 . The volume fraction of each component is calculated from the weight fraction and the known density of the component of the monomer mixture assuming no changes in volume on mixing.Densities of the monomers are available in the usual sources such as The Polymer Handbook,The Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology, and the manufacturers of the various monomers. The range of S. P.of the monomers employed in the polymers pf the instant invention is from about 9.0 to about 9.5 with the range 9.1 t to 9.4 being preferred. The calculated Tg of a polymer is determined by the equation of T. G. Fox, Bull. Am. Physics Soc. 1, 3, page 123 1956 based on the Tg of homopolymers of the individual monomers in the copolymer. Tables of the Tg of homopolymers are given in Polymer Handbook , section III, part 2, by W. A. Lee andR. A. Rutherford herein incorporated by reference. Tg values referred to herein are calculated Tg values for high molecular weight polymers. The polymers of this invention have a from about 20 C. to about 200 C. with the range 100 C. to 10 C. being preferred. Other monomers which can be used in these alternative embodiments are preferably vinyl aromatic hydrocarbons, such as vinyl toluene and alpha methyl styrene alkyl acrylates wherein the alkyl group has 1 to 8 carbon atoms, such as ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, and 2 ethylhexyl acrylate alkyl methacrylates having 2 to 4 carbon atoms, such as ethyl methacrylate and isobutyl methacrylate and acrylonitrile. The vinyl polymer used in the present invention is made as an aqueous dispersion of an emulsion polymer at about 40 to 60 by weight of polymer solids. Monomers can be selected from the group consisting of C2 C18 alkyl acrylates, C2 Cl8 alkyl methacrylates, vinyl aromatic compounds, vinyl halides, vinylidene halides, vinyl esters of saturated carboxylic acids, other polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids and esters thereof, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile and alpha oiefins, Examples of the C2 C18 alkyl groups of the esters of acrylic and methacrylic acids which are useful in forming the polymers of this invention include methyl, ethyl, n butyl, i butyl, sec butyl, t butyl the various isomeric pentyl, hexyl, hep tyl, and octyl especially 2 ethylhexyl , .isobornyl,decyl,lauryl, cetyl, stearyl and like groups. Examples of useful vinyl aromatic compounds include styrene and derivatives therebf such as vinyl toluene and alpha methyl styrene of vinyl and vinylidene halides are the corresponding chloride compounds of vinyl esters of saturated carboxylic acids include vinyl acetate and vinyl propionate, of polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated mono carboxylic and dicarboxylic acids include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid and crotonic acid and of alpha olefins include ethylene, propylene, and butylene. In the following examples parts and percentages are by weight and temperature in degrees Celsius unless otherwise indicated. The examples illustrate the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the invention thereto. As given below, a general method was followed in the preparation of yarns and films The method was followed throughout the examples unless an exception is noted in a given example. The same is true of the general test methods given below. Prepara tiorr of Materials Sized Yarns The latex, at a pH of ca. 2.0 to 2.5 as prepared, or at a higher acid pH such as about 4 or 5, is diluted to 8 resin solids with water and applied to polyester or nylon filament yarn at room temperature on a laboratory size single end slasher. The slasher employs a double squeeze and consists of an immersion bath followed by a metal drum and two Teflon coated drums, the first squeeze being between the metal drum and the first Teflon coated drum and the second squeeze between the two Teflon coated drums. The slasher is run at 4M min and the sized yarn is dried 15 seconds through a tube dryer set at 115 C. All sized yarn is conditioned one day at 21 0C. and 60 R.H. before testing. Film Preparation 20 mil films are prepared by diluting the latex with water to the necessary solids content per volume. The diluted latex is then poured into a polypropylene culture dish, placed in a dust free area on a level surface, and air dried for 4 days or until a clear film is obtained. Thinner films about 0.2 mils are prepared by pouring a 15 solids latex, obtained by dilution with warm water 54 C onto a two milMylar sheet. The films are room dried overnight, then oven dried for one minute at 110 C Test Methods Adhesion by Sand Tumble Test The sized yarns are evaluated for wet and dry adhesion using laboratory sand tumble tests.Dry Duplicate 3 yd. skeins of the sized yarn are placed in an 8 oz. jar containing 150g of coarse sand, rotated for 30 minutes on an Atlas Launder ometert, removed and rated for of the fibr bundle remaining intact. Wet The same procedure is followed except the jar now contains 50g of sand and 1509 water. Ratings are made the same way.Adhesion to Mylar The adhesion of the thin film is determined by two methods, scrape and crinkle.The scrape test consists of scraping the film with a razor blade and counting the number of strokes required to remove the polymer film from the polyester sheet. The crinkle test is designed to measure the film adhesion to polyester sheet b crumbling the sheet by hand and flattening it, noting any film separation from the Mylar. In the scrape test the results are classed as follows Poor 1 2, Fair 3 4, Good 5 and Excellent 6 or more strokes.Crinkle test results are judged Excellent no change or Fair cracks and slight film removal.Water Resistance The wet sand tumble test, previously noted, is a preliminary screen test of the water resis tance. All additional testing of this property is conducted on the polymer films, either free or on Mylar, as follows One inch squares OL both the free and Mylar films are placed in 300C water for 30 minutes and evaluated for any change in clarity, toughness, adhesion, and size using the following ratings Excellent no change Good film swelling and Fair swelling and loss df toughness. The 20 milLfree film is also evaluated for moisture.regain when first bone dried and then subjected to 95 RH in a constant humidity chamber the film is also observed for degree or haze developed. . Tack The tackiness of the polymer is evaluated, immediately following one minute drying at 110 C, on the film cast on Mylar. For this evaluation, two films on Mylar are pressed film film and then opened to gauge adhesion. Removeability of the Size This property is evaluated by two methods, alkali solubility of the film, and an actual scouring of sized yarn., Solubility of the film is determined by placing of a 3 4 2cm square of the 20 mil free film in a 1 Na2CO3 solution at 700C and recording the time it takes to dissolve up to 20 min. at which time the level of incomplete solution is gauged. The sized yarn is evaluated for size removal by scouring the yarn at 70 740C for 30 minutes in a 1.0 Na2CO3 and 0.1 surfactant Triton X 100 bath with mild agita tion. The yarns are rinsed five minutes in warm water 540C and then cold water. The degree of removeability is determined by dyeing scoured and control yarns in Basic Red 14 at 600C and observing the dye pickup. The following abbreviations are used in the examples, below BA butyl acrylate, St styrene, AA acrylic acid, MMA methyl methacrylate, MMA methacrylic acid, EA ethyl acrylate, EGDMA ethyleneglycol dimeth acrylate,iBMA isobutyl methacrylate, VT vinyl toluene, MeST cC methyl styrene, AN acrylonitrile, 2 ElA 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, PMA propyl methacrylate, and EMA ethyl methacrylate. Example 1 Copolymers Containing 12 Acrylic Acid Film and yarn are prepared using acrylic copolymer latex samples described in Table I below. The yarn being sized is Milliken textured polyester yarn, Saluda 373, 70 Denier, 33 filament, 1 twist. The test results, in Table I below, show that the samples varying in butyl acrylate content from 45 to 50.58 are all suitable sizing polymers compared to two commercial materials All lE . All of the examples exhibited no tack, except 1D which had slight tack, when hot. The viscosity average molecular weight of the polymer of Example 1A is about 1.2 to 1.3 million. Example 2 Copolymers of 12 Methacrylic Acid Using the same yarn as in Example 1 methacrylic acid containing polymers having 55 60 butyl acrylate are tested with the results found in Table II. An additional observation made is that the methacrylic acid samples produced less foam in the bath and during handling than the corresponding acrylic acid samples.All of the examples exhibited no tack. The weight average molecular weight of the polymer in Example 2C is about 600,000 to 700,000.

Example 3 Compositional Variations Polymer latexes of various compositions, as reported in Table III below, are used to prepare films and size yarns as in Example 1. The results in TableIII indicate that the polymer based on ethyl acrylate 3C has low adhesion, both by the sand tumble test and the two adhesion to Mylar tests, is high in moisture regain and produces a hazy film when tested for water resistance of a thin film on Mylar. Example 3D, having 4 acid in the copolymer, exhibits an insoluble film and less than complete removability from the yarn upon scouring and slightly hazy thin film on Mylar in the water resistance test.Example 3E, having 16 acid in the copolymer, also shows less tan complete removability from the yarn on scouring and in addition has limited water resistance shown by both the 20 milLfilm and the thin film results. The only examples, in this group, exhibiting tack are 3C which has some tack when hot and 3D which has some tack even when cooled to room tempera ture.
