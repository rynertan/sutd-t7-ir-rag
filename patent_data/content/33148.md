## Description
Tubular Membrane Module Element and Process for Producing Same This invention relates to a tubular membrane module element having a structure in which a semiper meable membrane such as a reverse osmosis membrane, an ultrafiltration membrane or the like which is widely utilized for desalinization of sea water, treatment of industrial waste water, concentration of foods and the like is fitted to the internal surface of a water per meable pressure supporting tube, and a process for pro ducing the tubular membrane module element. Semipermeable membrane modules which are now widely used are roughly classified according to their structures into a hollow fiber type, a spiral type, a tubular type and a plate and frame type, and are pro perly used depending upon purposes. Among them, tubular type semipermeable membrane modules are advantageous in that pretreatment of the membrane can be simplified, fouling substances formed on the membrane off can relatively easily be washe รง nd the membrane can easily be exchanged at the working site. Therefore, they are often employed in the fields of recovery of valuable materials from waste water, concentration of foods, and treatment of waste water. As processes for forming internal pressure type tubular membrane module elements in which a semipermeable membrane is fitted to the internal surface of a pressure supporting tube, there is generally used a process comprising forming a tubular membrane by thinly flow casting a cast solution dopeontothe internal sur face of a stainless steel tube or a glass tube, and then inserting the tubular membrane into the water permeable pressure supporting tube. Therefore, there has heretofore been employed a process comprising forming a tubular membrane having an outer diameter smaller than the inner diameter of the pressure supporting tube, inserting the tubular membrane into the pressure supporting tube, and then applying internal pressure to the tubular membrane to increase its diameter, thereby bringing it into close contact with the pressure supporting tube. For example, there have the been disclosed inventions relating to difference between inner diameters of pressure supporting tubes and diame ters of tubular semipermeable membranes in Published Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Nos. 115681 78 and 125978 78.When a tubular membrane whose outer diameter smaller than the inner diameter of the pressure supporting tube is inserted into the supporting tube and the membrane is expanded by applying thereto internal pressure as described in Published Unexamined Japan. Pat. the Appln. No. 125978 78, there arises problem of a decrease in the solute rejection of the tubular membrane. On the other hand, when the outer diameter of the tubular membrane is larger than the inner diameter of the pressure supporting tube, wrinkles are produced on the surface of the tubular membrane when the tubular membrane module element is operated by applying internal pressure thereto, and the wrinkles cause a decrease in ca e the solute rejection. In the idealithe inner diameter of the pressure supporting tube is just the same as the outer diameter of the tubular membrane, but this is very difficult to achievel because variations in these values necessarily appear at the time of forming the pressure supporting tube and the tubular membrane. made The present inventors have extensive studies to find that the problem mentioned above can be solved by using a semipermeable membrane element produced by connecting a semipermeable tape and a water impermeable tape with each other along their longitudinal edges. This invention provides a tubular membrane module element comprising a water permeable pressure supporting tube and a semipermeable membrane element fitted to the internal surface of the pressure sup porting tube, characterized in that the semipermeable membrane element is a membrane tube comprising a waterimpermeable tape and a semipermeable membrane tape con nected with each other along their longitudinal edgesPreferably the two tapes are overlapping and sticked together with an adhesive, the outer diameter of this membrane tube being larger than the inner diameter of the pressure supporting tube. This invention also provides a process for producing a tubular membrane module element comprising a water permeable pressure supporting tube and a semiper meable membrane element fitted to the internal surface process of the aforesaid pressure supporting tube, the compri sing forming a semipermeable membrane element having an outer diameter larger than the inner diameter of the pressure supporting tube by connecting a water impermeable tape and a semipermeable membrane tape along their preferably overlapping longitudinal edges. Preferably the two tapes are connected by sticking with an adhesive one side of each tape together while keeping at least the semipermeable membrane tape flat Then the semipermeable membrane element is inserted into the pressure suuporting tube. In the attached drawings, Figure 1 is a cross sectional view of an example of the semipermeable membrane element used in this invention Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of a tubular membrane module element into which the semipermeable membrane element of Figure 1 is fitted Figure 3 is a cross sectional view of another example of the tubular membrane module ele ment of this invention Figures 4 and 5 are cross sectional views of other examples of the semipermeable membrane element us ed in this invention Figure 6 is a schematic view showing a sticking method used in this invention Figures 7 to 9 are cross sectional views of examples of three sticking methods taken along the line A A of Figure 6 Figure 10 is a cross sectional view of the semipermeable membrane element after sticking and before forming into a tubular shape Figures 11 and 12 are cross sectional views showing a process of forming the semipermeable membrane element into a tubular shape Figure 13 is a cross sectional view of a tubular membrane module element into which the semipermeable membrane element of Figure 12 is fitted and Figure 14 is a vertical sectional view of a tubular module into which the tubular membrane module elements of this invention are incorporated. The characteristics of this invention are more clearly explained below referring to Figures 1 and 2 showing an example of this invention. Figure 1 is a cross sectonal view of a semipermeable membrane element 20 used in this invention, in which numeral 1 denotes a semipermeable membrane tape and numeral 2 a water or edges impermeable tape, and both sides of the semipermeable or edges membrane tape 1 are sticked on both sides of the waterimpermeable tape 2 with an adhesive 3 and 3 . The semi 20 permeable membrane element is inserted into a pressure supporting tube 4 having an inner diameter smaller than the outer diameter of the semipermeable membrane element, so that the water impermeable tape may be bent as shown in Figure 2,thus forming a tubular membrane module element 5 Owing to such a structure of the tubular 5 membrane module element the semipermeable membrane is not stretched even when operated while the tubular membrane module element is under internal pressure, and the semipermeable membrane element can be fitted tightly into the internal surface of the pressure supporting tube without producing wrinkles on the surface of the semipermeable membrane. The outer diameter of the semipermeable 20 membrane element is sufficient if only it is larger than 4 the inner diameter of the pressure supporting tube. The width of the semipermeable membrane tape may be less the than value obtained by multiplying the inner diameter 4 of the pressure supporting tube by the circular constant or , although no trouble occurs even if it is more than the aforesaid value. Figure 3 shows an example of the case where the width of the semipermeable membrane tape is larger than the value obtained by multiplying the inner diameter of the pressure supporting tube by the circular constant. The structure of the semipermeable membrane 20 element may be either that shown in Figure 1 or those shown in Figures 4 and 5. The important thing is that a solution to be treated should not leak out from the joint portions between the semipermeable membrane tape and the water impermeable tape during the use of the tubular module. The semipermeable membrane tape of this invention may be either that formed from a semipermeable membrane alone or that reinforced with a water permeable reinforcing material in order to increase rigidity as mentioned hereinafter. As the semipermeable membrane cellulose acetate membrane, polyacrylonitrile membrane, polyamide membrane or polyvinylalcohol membrane can be used. As the water permeable reinforcing material woven or nonwoven cloth made of polyester, nylon or cellulose are suitable. 2 The water impermeable tape should withstand deformation such as bending and should have not only sufficient flexibility but also sufficient water impermeability. As the water impermeable tape, thin films of, for example, polyethylene polypropylene, an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, non rigid polyvinyl chloride, etc., are suitable The modulus of rigidity of the water impermeable tape should be lower than that of the semipermeable membrane tape. e.g. Adhesives, made of epoxide resin, urethane resin, etc., can be used to stick the semipermeable membrane tape and the water impermeable tape. As the water permeable pressure supporting 4 tube of this invention, there may be used either porous and water permeable tubes produced by, for example, forming a tube by using glass fiber woven fabric, impregnating the resulting tube with a thrmosetting resin such as phenol resin, epoxide resin, unsaturated polyester resin, etch, and then curing the thermosetting resin, or tubes obtained by making tiny holes in a non porous tube made from stainless steel, glass fiber reinforced plastics, and the like. If necessary, a water introducing material such as woven fabrics may be provided between the pressure supporting tube and the semipermeable membrane element. When the tubular membrane module element mentioned above is used, the properties of the semipermeable membrane can stably be retained for a long period of time. The process for producing a tubular membrane module element 5 of this invention is characterized by employing a method of connecting a semipermeable membrane tape and a water impermeable tape along their longitudinal edges, preferably by sticking each side of a semipermeable membrane tape and each side of a water impermeable tape together with an adhesive for forming a semipermeable membrane element. Owing to th is characteristic, the process of this invention is remarkably improved in productivity as compared with the conventional method of forming a tubular film in a tube by a flow casting process one by one.As the method for sticking the semipermeable membrane tape and the water impermeable tape to each other, there can be employed a method of, as shown in Figures 6 and 7, feeding each of the semipermeable membrane tape 1 and the water impermeable tape 2 or longitudinal edges in a flat state, feeding an adhesive 3 onto both sides of each tape from each nozzle 6, and then sticking them to bind together. According to this method, sticking can be performed without damaging the surfaces of the semipermeable membrane tape, and moreover the resulting assembly can easily be taken off and wound up.In Figures 6 and 7, 7 and 7 show sticking rolls and 8 and 8 show take off rolls. As to the state of eacb tape at the time of sticking, at least the semipermeable membrane tape 1 should be in a flat state, however the water impermeable tape 2 need not particularly be flat. Figure 8 shows an example of sticking of the water impermeable tape 2 in a non flat state. When both sides of the water impermeable tape 2 are bent as shown in Fig. 9, inward and sticked on the semipermeable membrane tape, the subsequent forming step becomes easy. e.g. as shown in Fig.10, The semipermeable membrane element, obtained by onto sticking the tapes each other by the aforesaid method is bent so that the water impermeable tape 2 may assume the form as shown in Figure 11, formed into a tubular shape as shown in Figure 12, and then inserted into a pressure supporting tube. Figure 13 is a cross sectional view of a tubular membrane module element obtained by inserting the semipermeable membrane element into the water permeable pressure supporting tube. If tubular membrane module elements are produced in the manner described above, tubular modules having stable performance for a long period of time can be obtained. Figure 14 shows an example of a tubular 21 module into which a plurality of tubular membrane module elements 5 of this invention have been incorporated.Both ends of the tubular membrane module element 5 can easily be sealed by using usual packing 11 and an an adapter 12.
