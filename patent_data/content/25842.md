MITOGENIC ACTIVITIES FOR MOUSE SPLEEN CELLS Materials and Methods 1 Animal Mice used for this experiment were male BALB C Strain, aged 13 weeks Test I or female BALB C strain, aged 9 weeks Test 2 . C2 Tissure Culture Medium The tissure culture medium employed was a complete medium designated Roswell Park Memorial Institute RRMI 1640. All media employed contained 100 units ml of penicillin G and 100 g ml of streptomycin sulfate and 10 fetal calf serum. 3 Cell Preparation Spleens were removed under sterile conditions, and washed with Hanks solution and then teased in the tissue culture medium. The cells were suspended in the tissue culture medium to con tain 8 x 106 celis ml. 4 Culture Conditions Into each hole of Microtest II tissue culture plate 8 x 12 hole maker Falcon Plastics Co. were poured 0,1 ml of the above cells suspension and 0.1 ml of the prescribed con centrate of the test compound as described below and then the cultures we. incubated intriplicate at 370C in a humidified atmosphere 958 air, 5 CO2. for 48 hours. The control culture contained 0.1 ml of the culture medium instead of the medium containing the test compound. r5 SH Thymidine uptake In all tests, 20 l of 10 micro curine Cu Ci ml of tritiated thymidine 3H thymidine was added to each hole for the final 24 hours of culture. After the culture was completed, the resultant cells were filtered with a filter paper, Whatman GF83 and washed successively with saline and with 5 trichloroacetic acid. The filter paper was dried and placed in a scintillator toluene 1l, containing 0.1 g of p bis 5 phenyloxazoyl benzene an d 4 g of 2, 5 diphenyloxa zoyl , and 3H thy midine incorporated into DNA was measured. 6 Stimulation Index 3H thymidine uptake net cpm at treatmentStimulation Index 3H thymidine uptake net cpm at control 7 Test Compound 1 EMI81.1 Results 1 Test 1 Table 6.

PROTECTIVE EFFICACY, IN EXPERIMENTAL INFECTION IN MICE In determining the protective efficacy against experimental infections in mice, the test compound was dissoloed in and diluted with sterile saline to provide prescribed concentrations of drug. Male ICR strain mice, aged 4 weeks were used in groups of ten mice. E. coli 22 was cultivated overnight at 370C on frypticase so ,y agar and then were suspended in a sterile saline to obtain microbial cell concentration of 9.0 x 107 CE.U .
