# Developing apparatus.

## Abstract
A developing apparatus 34 is so set as to face the deve loped section of the electrostatic latent image forming plane 56 of the photosensitive drum 54 , and causes a magnetic developing agent 40 to be magnetically conducted to the electrostatic latent image forming plane 56 . Further, a mag net roll is so provided as to face that portion of the electrostat ic latent image forming plane 56 of the photosensitive drum 54 which has passed the developed region, thereby adsorp tively removing the unnecessary particles of the developing agent 40 which are deposited on the electrostatic latent im age forming plane 56 . Therefore, the developing apparatus 34 , though possessed of a relatively simple arrangement, has the advantages of suppressing the occurrence of the aforesaid tailing phenomenon, and enabling a distinct impression to be transcribed on a copy sheet with the reproducibility of fine lines prominently improved.
