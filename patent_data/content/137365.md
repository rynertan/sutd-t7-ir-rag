As the Antibiotic TAN 547 producing strain which is used in this invention, any and all microorganisms may be employable, only if they belong to the genus Lysobacter and are capable of producing Antibiotic TAN 547. Their examples include a new species of microorganism, Lysobacter lactamgenus. As specific examples thereof, there may be mentioned Lysobacter lactamgenus YK 90 hereinafter referred to in some instances briefly as Strain YK 90 which was isolated from a soil sample collected at Niimi City,Okayama Prefecture, Japan. The microbiological characteristics of Strain YK 90 are described in the following a Morphology Observation after the cultivation on a nutrient agar slant at 240C for 5 days reveals that the cells are in the form of rod having a diameter of 0.7 to 0.9 pm and a length of 1.0 to 3.5 pm or sometimes in the form of elongated rod having a length of 6.5 to 8.0 pm and that the microorganism, without flagella observed, exhibits gliding motility, forms no spore, and is gram negative but not acid fast. b The growth characteristics on various media Observation was made during the cultivation at 240C over the period of 1 to 14 days. 1 Nutrient agar plate culture Opaque, pale yellow and circular colonies with convex surface and entire margin.No diffusive pigment produced. 2 Nutrient agar slant culture Moderate, spreading growth.

Consequently, Strain YK 90 was compared with the known species of the genus Lysobacter. As the known species of the genus Lysobacter, there are known only four species and one subspecies described in Inernational Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, 28, 367 393 1978 . Comparison of the characteristics of Strain YK 90 with the descriptions of these five species 45 strains are described in the above literature led us to inability to find any known strain of microorganisms which shared all of the below described characteristics with Strain YK 90 namely in that 1 the oxidative fermentative test is not degrada tive, 2 production of acid and gas from sucrose and lactose is not observed, 3 production of soluble pigment is not observed, 4 the ability to hydrolyze starch is lacking, and 5 utilization of nitrates is absent. Therefore, we identified Strain YK 90 as a strain belonging to the novel species of microorganism, and named r the said novel species Lysobacter lactamgenus. The above Lysobacter lactamgenus YK 90, has been deposited as of 14th September, 1983 at the Institute for Fermentation, Osaka IFO , Japan under the deposit number of IFO 14288. This microorganism has also been deposited as of 19th September, 1983 at the Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Ministry ot International Trade and Industry FRI , Japan under the deposit number of FERM P 7247, and the deposit has been converted to a deposit under the Budapest Treaty, and has been stored at FRI under the accession number of FERM BP 575. The microorganism of the genus Lysobacter which is used in the present invention is generally liable to vary its characteristics, and can be easily caused to undergo mutation by aritificial mutation means using for example ultraviolet light, X rays and chemical agents e.g., nitrosoguanidine, ethylmethanesulfonic acid, etc. . Any of such mutants can also be used in the present invention insofar as they are capable of producing the compound I that the present invention aims at. In the cultivation of the compound I producing strain, as the carbon source, use is suitably made of carbon sources which are assimilatable to the strain, such as glucose, maltose, spent molasses, fats and oils e.g., soybean oil, olive oil, etc. and organic acids e.g., citric acid, succinic acid, gluconic acid, etc. . As the nitrogen source, organic nitrogen compounds and inorganic nitrogen compounds, such as soybean meal, cottonseed meal, corn steep liquor, dried yeast, yeast extract, meat ex. tract, peptone, urea, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride and ammonium phosphate, can be utilized.As the inorganic salt, inorganic salts which are normally required for the cultivation of microorganisms, such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium carbonate, magnesium sulfate, monopotassium phosphate and disodium phosphate, are used solely or in suitable combination.If sulfur compounds which the compound I producing strain of the genus Lysobacter can assimilate, such as inorganic sulfur compounds exemplified by sulfates e.g., ammonium sulfate, etc. , thiosulfates e.g., ammonium thio sulfate, etc. and sulfites e.g., ammonium sulfite, etc. , organic sulfur compounds exemplified by sulfur containing amino acids e.g., cystine, cysteine, L thiazolidine 4 carboxwlic acid, etc. , hypotaurine and sulfur containing peptides e.g., glutathion, etc. or mixtures thereof, are added to the culture medium, the production amount of the objective compound may be sometimes increased. Furthermore, heavy metals such as ferrous sulfate and copper sulfate, vitamins such as vitamin B1 and biotin, and so forth are added, if desired. In addition, antifoams such as silicone oil and polyalkylene glycol ether and surface active agents may be added. Other organic and inorganic materials which can support the growth of the microorganism and promote the production of the compound I may be suitably added. With reference to the cultural method, the cultivation may be conducted in the same manner as the processes for the production of common antibiotics, and may be by means of the solid or liquid cultural method. In the case of liquid culture, any of stationary culture, submerged culture, shake culture, aerated culture, etc. may be conducted, though submerged aerobic culture is particularly preferable. The temperature of incubation is preferably in the range of about lO0C to 300C1 and the cultivation is carried out over the pH range of about 4 to 8 for 8 to 168 hours, preferably for 24 to 144 hours. For recovering the objective compound I , the conventional isolation means employed in the harvesting of metabolites produced by a microorganism from the microbial culture is suitably utilized. Since the compound I is provided with properties of aqueous basic substance the antibiotic, which contains weakly acid functional groups too, is a basic substance as the whole molecule and is contained predominantly in the filtrate of the cultured broth, for example, a filter aid is in the first place added to the cultured broth and microbial cells are removed by filtration or centrifugation the resulting filtrate is contacted with a suitable support to adsorb the.active ingredient in the filtrate, and the active ingredient is desorbed with a suitable solvent. Such means of isolation and harvesting is advantageously utilized.As the support or adsorbent for chromatography, advantageous use is made of those utilizing the difference in adsorptive power of compounds such as activated carbon, silica gel, powdered cellulose and adsorptive resins, those taking advantage of the difference in functional group of compounds such as cationic exchange resins, cationic exchange cellulose and cationic exchange Sephadex, and those utilizing the difference in molecular weight of compounds such as Sephadex products. In order to elute the objective compound from these supports, for example, aqueous solutions of water soluble organic solvents such as aqueous acetone and aqueous alcohols, or aqueous solutions containing acid, alkali, buffer or inorganic or organic salts are used in suitable combinations, which vary depending upon the type and nature of supports. Also, the crude product containing the antibiotic as obtained by these chromatographic procedures is subjected to preparative high performance liquid chromatography HPLC for separation to yield the purified product. In more particular, when a cationic exchange resin such as Dowex SOW produced by Dow Chemical Co., U.S.A. ,Amberlite IR 120 and 200 produced by Rohm Haas Co.,U.S.A. and Diaion SK 116 produced by Mitsubishi Chemical industries, Ltd.,Japan is employed as a support, the antimicrobial substance in the filtrate is adsorbed on the support, and then eluted with an aqueous solution containing salts, acids or buffer, etc. Alternatively, the antibiotic can be adsorbed on such a support as cationic exchange, molecular sieve resin, for example CM Sephadex Pharmacia Fine Chemicals Co., Sweden , and eluted with an aqueous solution containing salts or acids or buffer, etc. In order to remove salts, coloring materials, etc. in these eluates, activated carbon for chromatographic use produced by Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan or adsorptive resins such as Diaion HP 20 produced byMitsubishi Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan and AmberliteXAD II produced by Rohm Haas Co., U.S.A. are advantageously employed. The eluates fractionated are powdered by subjecting to steps such as concentration and lyophilization. For the purpose of further purification when the purity of the powder thus obtained is low, preparativeHPLC method is advantageously used. As the support which is useful in the method, there may be mentioned, for example, TSK Gel produced by Toyo SodaMfg. Co., Japan , YMC Gel produced by Yamamura ChemicalResearch Institute, Japan , etc., and as the mobile phase, use is made of mixtures of methanol or acetonitrile, etc.with aqueous solutions containing inorganic salts or buffer, etc. The compound I is isolated in the form of a pharmaceutically acoeptable salt with mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid or organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid and oxalic acid.
