# TRANSITION DETECTOR CIRCUITS

## Abstract
A CMOS address transition detector includes a first input circuit section, a first delay circuit section, a second input circuit section, a second delay circuit section and an output circuit section. The first input circuit section and the first delay circuit section are responsive to true address transition signals for controlling the pulse width of an output pulse signal. The second input circuit section and the second delay circuit section are responsive to a false address transition signal for controlling the pulse width of the output signal. The output circuit section generates at an output terminal the output pulse signal having a pulse width which is substan tially constant over a wide temperature range. The output circuit section has a first input which is responsive to the first input circuit section and the first delay circuit section when the true address transition signal makes a low to high transition. The output circuit section has a second input which is responsive to the second input circuit section and the second delay circuit section when the false address transition signal makes a low to high transition.
