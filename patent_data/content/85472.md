# Photosensitive polymer composition.

## Abstract
A photosensitive polymer composition containing the following components A and B is presented. A. 100 parts by weight of polyether ester amide com prising a at least one compound selected from the group consisting of aminocarboxylic acids having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, lactams having 6 to 15 carbon atoms and nylon mn salts wherein 10 m n 30, b at least one poly alkylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 200 to 6000, and c at least one dicarboxylic acid having 4 to 20 carbon atoms and B. 10 to 200 parts by weight of at least one photo polymerizable vinyl monomer having a terminal ethylenical ly unsturated bond and having a boiling point of at least 150 C. This photosensitive polymer composition is extremely effective for use in a photosensitive flexographic printing plate developable in water or an alcohol.
