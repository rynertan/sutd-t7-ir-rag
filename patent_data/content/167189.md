# A process for the preparation of a coagul√©.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of a coagulated material by impregnating a textile cloth in an impregnating bath containing at least a coagulable polymer latex followed by coagulation in a coagulating bath. The process of the invention is characterized in that the coagulation is carried out from the water phase, whereas the impregnating bath contains a chemical or physical foaming agent, wherein foaming occurs simultaneously with the coagulation or immediately thereafter. It is surprisingly found that according to the present process a high quality coagulated material is obtained, which is comparable with the coagulated material, obtained according to conventional processes.
