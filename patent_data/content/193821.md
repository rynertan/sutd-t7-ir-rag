# IN SITU ANALYSIS OF A LIQUID CONDUCTIVE MATERIAL

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for measuring the constituent elements of a liquid, electrically conductive material includes a probe mechanism, which delimits a sampling chamber having a spark electrode in communication therewith and which is adapted to contain a non reactive gas. An entry mechanism in troduces an aliquot of the conductive liquid into the sampling chamber, and a gap reference mechanism detects a reference gap distance between a free surface of the liquid aliquot and the spark electrode. A gap setting mechanism selectively changes the reference gap to a selected spark gap distance between the liquid free surface and the electrode. A spark generator means sparks an electrical discharge or arc be tween the electrode and the aliquot of liquid material to pro duce an aerosol sample within the sampling chamber com posed of particles of the conductive material within the gas. A flow control meachnism controls a flow of the gas in the region of the electric arc to provide a flow velocity which is sufficient to sweep the aerosol particles away from the liquid aliquot. A fluid transport mechanism then moves the aerosol sample from said sampling chamber to remotely located analyzer, wherein the aerosol sample is analyzed to measure the consti tuent elements of the material.
