## Description
The present invention relates to an apparatus for converting tree chips, sawmill, or other wood residues, or vegetable fibres into pulp and more particularly, to a continuous process of handling, continuous conveying, chemical pretreating, compressing, deairing, dewatering, pressure steaming, pressure releasing, refining and non compulsory bleaching into pulp of various properties. It is well known the conventional production of pulp by chemicals using Kraft or sulfite process removes the fibres from the wood by disolving the lignin that holds them together, produces low yield pulp. Stone ground wood pulp SGW is produced from wood logs by grinders under atmospheric pressure. Chemi ground wood CGW is chemicly pretreated either atmospheric or pressurized way and ground under atmospheric pressure. Pressurized ground wood PGW is ground under pressure at a high temperature. Refiner mechanical pulp RMP is produced by refining wood chips under atmospheric refining conditions with no pretreatment. Thermorefiner mechanical pulp TRMP is produced from chips in refiners, similar to conditions in RMP process, except chips are presteamed at 100 C 120 C, prior to refining. Thermomechanical pulp TMP is produced from chips first presteamed at 100 C with the first stage of refining at 100 C under pressure and other refining stages are at atmospheric pressure. Tandem TMP is produced from chips by first presteaming at 100 C 125 C and followed by first and second stage refining at elevated temperatures 110 C 130 C. Chemimechanical pulp CMP is produced from chips using a chemical pretreatment at a temperature below 100 C, followed by atmospheric refining. Chemithermomechanical pulp CTMP is produced from chips pretreated with sodium sulfite Na₂S0₃ prior to or during pre steaming and first refining stage at temperatures between 100 C and 135 C and other refining stages at atmospheric pressure. Semichemical mechanical pulp SCMP is produced from chips pretreated with chemicals at temperatures between 100 C and 130 C and then refined at atmospheric pressure. Neutral sulfite semichemical pulp NSSC used mainly for hardwood species uses continuous digester of short time and low temperature cook before refining under atmospheric pressure. All the above described processes are highly capital intensive, high energy consuming and enviromentaly restrictive. The Kraft and sulfite processes are of low yield contributing to fast depletion of forest and other vegetable fibre resulting in high cost of produced pulp. The above mentioned mechanical or refining pulping processes are of high yield, when compared to the chemical pulping processes, but require high energy input, resulting in high cost of the produced pulp. It is an aim of this present invention to provide a simple, relatively low capital cost equipment, in such an order as to handle vegetable fibre in an economic manner, with low energy requirements, minimum of rejects, low manual input and enviromentaly non restrictive. The invention is directed toward a new pulping process and the pulp and paper products resulting therefrom. The pulp produced by the process of the present invention is of very high yield 94 when unbleached and in a range of 86 to 92 when bleached, it requires less calorific energy, also less refining energy, in a range of 40 to 60 , of any other known refining process of virgin fibres. In order to retain high yield, it is further aim of the present invention to retain all of the hemicellulose and to avoid the lignin from being solubilized. The process alters some of the lignin and pitch in such a way as to form a new uncoloured complex in the pulp. The chelating agents added before the chemical pretreatment, during the hydrolysis and after the decompression of the chips or fibrous vegetable matters form, during the hydrolysis, during decompression and during refining, extremly strong bond with divalent and trivalent heavy metals and compete successfully with lignin complex to form colourless chelating complexes. Not only laboratory handsheets prepared from the pulp but also sheets made by industrial applications of the pulp have superior tensile strength, tear strength, burst and opacity when compared to sheets made of SGW, CGW, PGW, RMP, TRMP, CMP, TMP, TANDEM TMP, CTMP, SCMP and NSSC. The pulp when used as an extender to the Kraft furnish does not degrade the physical properties of the produced paper. A process in accordance with the present invention includes the steps of conveying the wood fibres in a continu ous operation for a pretreatment, under atmospheric pressu re, with chemicals, then the compression of said fibre to extract air between them and to extract some of the liquid from the fibres. The compressed vegetable fibres are then conveyed in a continuous manner through a pocket valve, or loading screw or vegetable fibre plug created by mechanical or hydraulical means into a pressurized steam vessel. In the pressurized steam vessel the vegetable fibres are freely moved by means of a worm or ribon conveyor toward the opposite site of the vessel. The speed of the movement of the vegetable fibre in the pressure steaming vessel is variable. It is directly related to the rate of feed and volume of the pretreated vegetable fibre and the desired steam treatment. At the end of the pressure vessel, the chemically pretreated and pressure steamed vegetable fibres are released by means of a decompression chambre into a dozing bin. This action shatters the lignin and defibrate most of the vegetable fibre. 20 to 30 of the fibres have been found to be acceptable and 70 to 80 in form of shives or shattered fibre bundles need further refining. From the dozing bin the defibrated fibres are transported or conveyed into refiners. Refining is executed by disc refiners under pressurized or atmospheric discharge operation. Prior to non compulsory bleaching the refined pulp is washed, screened and preferably bleached in a single stage process. The brightness increase of up to 28 points have been experienced during laboratoty bleaching trials with Hydrogene Peroxyde H₂O₂, Sodium Peroxide Na₂O₂, Oxygene O₂ and Ozone O₃ at pulp consistency of 12 to 22 . Brightness reversion protection have been successfully achieved by post treatment with Sulfur bioxyde sO₂. An apparatus in accordance with the present invention includes an intergrated system having a chemical pretreatment metering means in to the vegetable fibre flow, metering means of fibres into a fibre compression chambre, fibre compressing means, air and moisture relieve means from a fibre compression means, means to activate pocket valve, loading screw or vegetable fibre plug of a compression means, means to discharge a pocket valve, or loading screw or vegetable plug into the pressurized steam vessel, means to move the vegetable fibre inside the steam pressure vessel, means for activating the worm, screen or ribon conveyor according to predetermined information received from the fibre metering means, means of unloading vegetable fibre from a steam pressurized vessel into a decompression means, means to release the vegetable fibre from decompression means to a dozing means, means transporting or conveying the decompressed vegetable fibre into the refining means and non compulsory means to transport the refined pulp to bleaching means. A further feature of the present invention includes a control system which includes a first scanning means at the infeed of wood fibre, input data receiving means for interp reting the data received from the first scanning means and for measuring the moisture content of the fibre and weight volume input according to the predetermined parameters, means associat ed with said control system for activating a speed control of the fibre infeed, measuring means controled by the control system means of the fibre flow control system based on said data to introduce chemicals in solution or in a dry form into the fibre flow, means for controling the pocket valve, or loading screw or vegetable fibre plut activity, means to activate the discharging of vegetable fibre into a pressure vessel, means related to flow of vegetable fibre into a fibre compression means, means to interpret rate of feed to control the fibre movement in a steam pressure vessel according to the predetermined schedule stored in a memory, sensing means associated with discharge of fibre from pressure steam vessel, input data receiving means for interpreting and controling the refining mechanism and refining according to predetermined refining patterns stored in the memory. Having thus generally described the nature of the invention, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, showing by way of illustration, a preferred embodiment thereof and in which Referring now to the drawings and particularly to figure 1, there is shown an integrated processing mill for con version of wood chips, or vegetable fibre into pulp. An embodiment of the integrated processing mill includes a chip or vegetable fibre conveyor 1 for conveying vegetable fibre, a pretreatement stations 2 for application of chemicals, chips or vegetable fibre level detector 17 for controling the flow of chips or vegetable fibre through the pretreatment stations and for controling the level of chemicals 4 in the first pretreatment station 2 further a worm, or screw or ribon conveyor 3 for conveying residues from first pretreatment station 2 on to a vegetable fibre conveyor 5 leading into second pretreatment station 6. A further scanner 18 may be provided for again measuring the vegetable fibre volume from the second pretreatment station 6 into the compression chamber 8 operating under a predetermined pressure, compressed fibres are then advanced through a pocket valve, or loading screw or vegetable fibre plug 9 through a steam pressure vessel 10, through a decompression chamber 11 and 12 into a non compulsory dozing bin 13 through a non compulsory washing station 14 directly on to worm, screw or ribon conveyor 15, bypassing, if desired the washing station, leading into the refiner 16. Refined pulp is discharged into latency chest 19 and further the pulp is introduced into the bleaching station 20. Figure 2 shows reactions of chemical pretreatment of fibres 20 by complexing agents 21 and formation of hydrophylic groups 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 on fibre surface, creating a bond 28, it also demonstrates formation of hydrophilic group 22, 23, 24 on surface of vegetable fibres 20 by oxydating agents 21. Figure 3 is the step by step process sequence of chemical reactions by various pretreatment of vegetable fibres Step 1 Trys to eliminate free metalic cations which may cata lize oxidation of SO₂ to SO₃, elimination is done by complexing with complexing agent DTPA or others. Free metal DTPA Metal DTPA non reactive complex Example Fe, Mn, Cu, Al, etc. Metals may be present in different valences. To protect against oxydation, residues are pretreated with DTPA Sodium Diethylenetriaminopentaactate .5 3 or Further treatment is done by the following agents Steps 2 5 are designed to form Hydrophylic group by sulfonation or oxydation. The formation of Hydrophylic groups either by oxidation or sulfonation is proportional to the concentration of chemical products, vegetable fibre, time and temperature. At constant concentration of fibres and chemicals use, the process is controlled by time and retention temperature. In Step no. 2 and 3 determining factor for chemical reaction is time, since the temperature is very low. In the step number 4, it is the temperature which con trols the extent of sulfonation or oxidation. The speed of the sulfonation or oxidation may be also varied by concentration of the chemical products. Further figure 3 depicts step by step the sequence of the process of pretreatment of residues, its defibration and its refining as follows
