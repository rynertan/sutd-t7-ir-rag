# A method and an apparatus for cutting through and removing a threadlike or tapelike strapping element applied around an object or a stack of objects.

## Abstract
A method for cutting through and removing a strapping element 3 applied in a loop around an object 4 or a stack of objects, in which a plate 33 provided with one cutting member 38 of a pair of shears 38, 40 and a pressure area 39 is first moved parallel to the plane of the loop towards the object or the stack, thereupon moved perpendicularly to said loop until it attains a position between the object and the loop and thereafter moved away from the object to bring said cutting member 38 into cooperation with the other cutting member 40 for cutting through the loop and the pressure area 39 into cooperation with a driven roller 23 for grippfng and removing the strapping element of the cut through loop and an appratus comprising means for carrying out said method.
