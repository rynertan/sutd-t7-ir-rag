# Batteryless, portable, frequency divider.

## Abstract
A barteryless, portable, frequency divider including a first LC circuit L1, C1 that is resonant at a first frequency for detecting electromagnetic radiation at the first frequency a second LC circuit L2, C2 that is resonant at a second frequency that is one half the first frequency and a transistor Q1 coupling the first and second LC circuits for causing the second LC circuit to transmit electromagnetic radiation at the second frequency. The first and second LC circuits respectively include inductance coils that are positioned orthogonally to one another so as not to be mutually coupled. The frequency divider is operable solely from tne energy of the electro magnetic radiation detected by the first LC circuit. The frequency divider is useful as an electronic tag for attach ment to articles for enabling detection thereof when moved through a surveillance zone containing electromagnetic radiation at the first frequency and thereby is useful in shoplifting detection systems.
