# Viscosity modifiers for grafted starch polymer solutions.

## Abstract
Grafted starch polymer solutions of a low viscosity through the use of cinnamic acid material. The cinnamic acid material is incorporated into the grafted starch polymer which is prepared from starch and vinyl monomer, prefer ably acrylamide.
