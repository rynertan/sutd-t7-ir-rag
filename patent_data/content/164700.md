Compounds of formulae II , III , IV , VI ,tVII , VIII and IX are either known compounds or can be prepared from known compounds by known processes or processes analogous to known processes.The salts of compounds of formula I may be produced by treating the compound of formula I with the appropriate acid. Compounds of formula CI and salts thereof, produced by the above process, may be recovered by conventional methods. Compounds of formula I may be separated into diastereoisomeric pairs of enantiomers by, for example1 fractional crystallisation from a suitable solvent such as methanol or ethyl acetate or a mixture thereof. The pair of enantiomers thus obtained may be separated into individual stereoisomers by conventional means such as by the use of an optically active acid as a resolving agent. Suitable optically active acids which may be used as resolving agents are described in Topics in Stereo chemistry , Viol. 6, Wiley Interscience, 1971, Allinger, N.L. and Eliel, W.L. Eds. Alternatively any enantiomer of a compound of formula I may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials of known configuration. A compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof hereinafter the drug may be administered as the pure drug, however, it is preferred that the drug be administered as a pharmaceutical composition also comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor. As used herein the terms pharmaceutical composition and pharmaceutically acceptable embrace compositions and ingredients for both human and veterinary use for example the term pharmaceutically acceptable salts includes veterinarily acceptable salts.Usually the compositions of the present invention will be adapted for oral administration although compositions for administration by other routes, such as by injection are also envisaged.Particularly suitable compositions for oral administration are unit dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. Other fixed unit dosage forms, such as powders presented in sachets, may also be used.In accordance with conventional pharmaceutical practice the carrier may comprise a diluent, filler, disintegrant, wetting agent, lubricant, colourant, flavourant or the like.Typical carriers may, therefore, comprise such agents as microcrystalline cellulose, starch, sodium starch glycollate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulphate, sucrose and the like.Most suitably the composition will be provided in unit dose form. Such unit doses will normally comprise 0.1 to 1000 mg of the drug, more usually 0.1 to 500 mg and favourably 0.1 to 250 mg.The present invention also provides a compound of formula I for use as an active therapeutic substance. The present invention further provides a method for treating hyperglycaemia in a human or non human animal which method comprises administering an effective, non toxic amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a hypergycaemic human or non human animal.The present invention further provides a method for treating obesity in a human ornon human animal, which method comprises administering an effective, non toxic amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to an obese human or non human animal.Conveniently, the drug may be administered as a pharmaceutical composition as hereinbefore defined, and this forms a particular aspect of the present invention.In treating hyperglycaemic or obese humans the drug may be taken in doses, such as those described above, one to six times a day in a manner such that the total daily dose for a 70 kg adult will generally be about 0.1 to 6000 mg, and more usually about 1 to 1500 mg.In treating hyperglycaemic or obese non human animals, especially dogs, the drug may be administered by mouth, usually once or twice a day and at about 0.002 mg kg to 25 mg kg, for example 0.02 mg kg to 10 mg kg.In a further aspect the present invention also provides a method for improving the weight gain and or improving the feed utilisation efficiency and or increasing lean body mass of livestock, which method comprises the administration to livestock of an effective non toxic amount of a compound of formula I or a veterinarily acceptable salt thereof. Whilst the compounds of formula I and the veterinarily acceptable salts thereof may be administered to any livestock in the abovementioned method, they are particularly suitable for improving the weight gain and or feed utilisation efficiency and or lean body mass in poultry, especially turkeys and chickens, cattle, pigs and sheep.In the preceding method the compounds of formula I and veterinarily acceptable salts thereof will normally be administered orally although non oral modes of administration, for example injection or implantation, are also envisaged. Suitably the compounds are administered in the feed stuff or drinking water provided for the livestock. Conveniently these are administered in the feed stuff at from 10 3pom SOOppm of total daily fed intake, more usually O.Olppm to 250ppm, suitably less than 100ppm. The particular formulations used will of course depend upon the mode of administration but will be those used conventionally in the mode of administration chosen.For administration in feed stuff the drugs are conveniently formulated as a premix in association with a suitable carrier. Aceordingly, the present invention also provides a veterinarily acceptable premix formulation comprising a compound of I or a veterinarily acceptable salt thereof in association with a veterinarily acceptable carrier.Suitable carriers are inert conventional agents such as powdered starch. Other conventional feed stuff premix carriers may also be employed. No toxicological effects are indicated when a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered in any of the above mentioned dosage ranges.The invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following Examples, in which the substituents are as defined in the following TableEMI13.1 tb Experiment SEP R1 SEP R2 SEP R3 SEP R4 SEP X SEP n SEP Salt tb SEP No. SEP tb SEP 1 SEP 3 C1 SEP 3 C1 SEP CH3 SEP OCH2CO2Me SEP SEP 1 SEP HC1 tb SEP 2 SEP H SEP H SEP CH3 SEP OCH2CO2Et SEP SEP SEP 1 SEP HC1 tb SEP 3 SEP 3 C1 SEP 3 C1 SEP CH3 SEP OCH2CO2Et SEP SEP SEP 1 SEP HC1 tb SEP 4 SEP H SEP H SEP CH3 SEP OCH2CO2Et SEP 2 SEP 2 SEP HC1 tb SEP 5 SEP H SEP H SEP CH3 SEP OCH2CH2OH SEP SEP SEP 1 SEP HC1 tb SEP 6 SEP H SEP H SEP CH3 SEP OCH2CONHMe SEP SEP SEP 1 SEP HC1 tb SEP 7 SEP H SEP H SEP CH3 SEP OCH2CH2NHMe SEP SEP 1 SEP HC1 tb SEP 8 SEP H SEP H SEP CH3 SEP OCH2CONH2 SEP O SEP 1 SEP HC1 tb Methyl 4 2 bis ss hydroxy 3 chlorophenethyl amino propyl phenoxyacetate hydrochloride monohydrate.To a solution of RR,SS N 2 4 carbomethoxymethoxyphenyl 1 methylethyl 2 hydroxy 2 3 chlorophenyl ethanamine 8.5g in methanol 100 ml containing triethylamine 3 ml was added 3 chlorostyrene oxide 2.8g .

DEMONSTRATION OF EFFECTiVENESS OF COMPOUNDS a At hyperglyzaemic activityFemale CFLP mice, weighing approximately 25 g, were fasted for 24 hours prior to the study. The compound under study was administered orally as an aqueous solution to each of 6 mice. 30 minutes later a blood sample 10 wl was obtained from the tail for the analysis of blood glucose. Immediately after taking this blood sample, glucose t1 g kg body weight was administered subcutaneously to each mouse. 6 mice were given water as a control. Blood samples were then obtained from each mouse at 30 minute intervals for 120 minutes.Compounds that produce a significant P 0.05 reduction of blood glucose, compared with control mice given water, at any time interval, are considered active.The area under the blood glucose curve over the 2 hour period after the administration of the glucose was calculated for the compounds and compared with the value for control animals.
