# TAPE MEASURE

## Abstract
A gearless, open faced, direct drive, spring rewound tape measure eliminates the need for a manual rewind handle or gears to increase the spring tensioning force. A spiral spring is retained within a spring retaining disk which is revolvable about a hub attached to a cover. A cover plate coupled through an input disk allows revolving of the spring retaining disk to adjust the tension of a spring which is retained within a spring retaining well of the spring retaining disk. Alternatively, the hub may be attached to the cover plate and the spring tension adjusted by revolving the cover plate while the spring retaining disk remains station ary. In ordinary use, the cover plate is restricted from revolving by compression lock rings which sandwich the cover plate.
