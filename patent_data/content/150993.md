# A method of fabricating a semiconductor memory structure and a semiconductor memory structure.

## Abstract
A method of fabricating a semiconductor memory struc ture and a semiconductor memory structure having a plural ity of memory cells 32,34,36 , adjacent cells being isolated. The method comprises the steps of developing a relatively thick oxide layer 12 on a silicon substrate 10 , etching holes through the oxide layer and implanting impurities in the sub strate 10 through said holes to define capacitor regions 16 . A dielectric layer 20 is formed over the implants and then a capacitor plate 22 is added over the dielectric layer. The spacing between cells is determined by the etching process, and the method has the advantage that one mask is used for several purposes including defining active transis tor areas and the first polysilicon layer. Additional advan tages are disclosed including a higher body effect in the isolation transistors, use of a nitride dielectric layer, and a higher, stable threshold voltage in the isolation transistors. Also, modification of the improved process for fabrication of P channel and N channel devices can be made.
