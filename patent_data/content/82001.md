## Description
APPARATUS FOR AND A METHOD OF METALLISING A LENGTH OF MATERIAL. The present invention relates to apparatus for and a method of metallising a length of material. Where a coloured surface appearance to the metallised surface is required the metal coating which is normally aluminium is lacquered. This additional operation step is time consuming and expensive. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided apparatus for metallisng a length of material comprising a vacuum chamber housing supply means for the supply of the length of material to be metallised, a source for the production of evaporated aluminium and take up means for receiving the length of metallised material, the vacuum chamber being provided with means enabling oxygen to be introduced thereto during the metallising process. A preferred embodiment of the invention may comprise any one or more of the following advantageous features a The means enabling the oxygen to be introduced is disposed at the periphery of the chamber, b The means enabling the oxygen to be introduced is disposed at a position intermediate the periphery of the chamber and the source, c The means enabling the oxygen to be introduced is disposed at a position adjacent the source fpr the production of evaporated aluminium, d The means enabling the oxygen to be introduced comprises more than one inlet, e The inlets comprising the means of d are spaced around the periphery of the chamber f One of the inlets of d is disposed at the periphery of the chamber and the remainder of them elsewhere in the chamber, g The or each oxygen inlet comprises a control valve. According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of metallising a length of material including the steps of passing the length of material to be metallised under vacuum conditions over a source of evaporated alumium in a vacuum chamber whilst simultaneously introducing oxygen to the chamber in order to modify at least the normal silver surface appearance of the metal coating of the material so produced. According to a still further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a web metallised with aluminium, the aluminium being oxidised on at least one surface in order to produce a surface appearance other than silver. In order that the invention may be more clearly understood, one embodiment thereof will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure l shows a front elevational view in section of a vacuum web metallising apparatus, Figure 2 shows a partial diagrammatic view of the metalliser of Figure 1 illustrating a modification, Figure 3 shows a partial diagrammatic view of the metalliser of Figure 1 illustrating a further modification, Figure 3a is a plan view of part of the metalliser of Figure 3, Figure 4 shows a partial diagrammatic view of the metalliser of Figure 1, illustratinga still further modification, and Figure 5 shows a graph of vacuum chamber pressure plotted against oxygen flow rate for a vacuum web metallising apparatus. In Figures 2 to 5 parts equivalent to those of the metalliser of Figure 1 have been given the same reference numerals but prefixed by the number of the figure in question. Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings, the web metallising apparatus comprises a vacuum chamber 1 housing an aluminium vapour source 2 comprising nine individual boats each 1O long, a pay off or supply reel 3, a driven take up reel 4 and a driven water cooled process drum 5. The web referenced W in Figure 1 follows a complex path defined by a series of guide rolls in conjunction with the surface of drum 5 from the supply reel 3 to the take up reel 4. The guide rolls are indicated generally by the reference G in Figure 1. An inlet 7 incorporating a needle valve is disposed in the periphery of the vacuum chamber 1. This inlet 7 enables a gas such as oxygen to be introduced into the chamber 1 during the metallising process.A monitor 6 is disposed between the source 2 and the take up reel 4 and a closed loop control system not shown is associated with this monitor 6. In operation, unmetallised web is fed from the supply reel 3 and s cooled as it passes over the working surface of the water cooled drum 5. The web is a 12 micron thick 1000 mm wide transparent polyester film such as that marketed under the trade mark Mellinex. Aluminiurn wrre is fed from a wire feed 8 to the vapour source 32. Oxygen is simultaneously introduced into the chamber 1 through the needle valve ef the inlet 7. The amount of oxygen admitted is such as to reduce the vacuum in the vacuum chamber from a usual 5 x 10 Torr to 7 x lO 3Torr. The oxygen is allowed to flood the entire interior of the vacuum chamber with no deliberate attempt being made to distribute it within the chamber.As the web passes over the working surface of the drum 5 a cloud of metal vapour condenses on the surface of the web facing the source 2 in the surrounding oxygen atmosphere. The oxygen modifies at least the normal silver surface appearance of the coating on the web to produce colouration and other optical effects. The monitor and associated control system ensures that the coating thickness is kept at a chosen nominal thickness and with a chosen tolerance. The surface appearance and other optical effects achieved may be varied by varying physical parameters of the metallising process. Table 1 shows surface appearance and other optical effects achived for various values of web speed, aluminium wire feed, chamber pressure, oxygen flow rate and resultant web resistivity. The colour visible on the underside of the web is in fact the colour of the underside of the metallising layer which can be seen through the transparent film constituting the web. It will therefore be appreciated that the constitution of the metallising layer varies from the under to the upper surface affecting the colour displayed. Surface appearance and other optical effects may also be varied by varying the position at which the oxygen is introduced into the vacuum chamber.Table 2 shows the surface appearance and other optical effects achieved with oxygen introduced through an inlet 27 incorporating a needle valve disposed adjacent one end and above the aluminium vapour source 22 as shown in Figure 2. One test was conducted with the needle valve fully open and with no oxygen flow control equipment fitted. Although a considerable quantity of oxygen was introduced in this test into the bottom of the aluminium vapour source there was a negligible increase in chamber pressure. able 3 shows the surface appe other optical effects achieved with oxygen introduced into the vacuum chamber 31 through an inlet manifold 37 disposed above the boats t th aluminium vapour source 32 but closely adjacent the surface of the process drum 35 as shown in Figure 3. The manifold 37, which is shown in plan view in Figure 3a, is made from i diameter pipe 37a provided with 17 holes 37b each of lmm diameter and arranged at a 2i pitch The inlet to the manifold is referenced 37c and the other end 37c is blanked off Apart from the greater range of colours achieved than with the arrangement of Figure 2, the Figure 3 mode of oxygen introduction may cause less deterioration to the boats of the vapour source than with theFigure 2 mode.It was also possible to produce effects with this mode attributable to the individual oxygen jet emanating from the holes of the manifold. Table 4 shows the surface appearance and other optical effects achieved with oxygen introduced into the vacuum chamber 41 through a manifold 47 disposed above the vapour source 42 and between that source 42 ana tie process tam 45 as s in Figure 4. This manifold 47 runs the full length of the vapour source 42, an inlet at one end and is blanked off at the other, and comprises 34 holes each 2mm in diameter and disposed at a pitch of 1 1 4 . Figure 5 is a graphical representation of the variation of chamber pressure with oxygen flow rate for oxygen injection at the front of the chamber as in Figure 1 and for oxygen injection into the vapour source box as in Figure 4 . These results were obtained with the Applicants Type sers.lOOOD vacuum metalliser and different results would be obtained from other metallisers. It will be appreciated that the above embodiments have been described by way of example only and that many variations are possible without departing from the scope of the invention claimed.For example greater control of oxygen flow rate may be employed and oxygen injection may be at several different points at the periphery of the chamber. Also, the description refers to single sided metallisers, but the invention is equally applicable to double sided metallisers where both surfaces of the web could be given a modified appearance. The invention would also be applied to metallising processes where more than one costing is applied to at least one eide of the web. The web could be pretreated and if more than one coating is applied not all the coatings need to be modified. The coated web could be treated after coating if desired. TABLE 1.
