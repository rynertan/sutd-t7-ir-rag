# Inverse control system.

## Abstract
An inverse control system is disclosed, which comprises FIR filters provided between transmitting elements at n n 2, 3,... input points of a linear FIR system and a common signal source, for an inverse control such as to provide desired impulse responses between the signal source and m n m output points of the linear FIR system. A j th j 1, 2, ..., n one of the FIR filters has a number L
