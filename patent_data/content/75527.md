# High melt strength elastomeric copolyesters.

## Abstract
An elastomeric copolyester resin having high melt strength and capable of being blow molded. The copolyester resin is made by adding to the polymerizing or initial mixture small amounts of a heat stable chain branching agent having three or more carboxyl groups, hydroxyl groups. or combinations thereof. The copolyester resin contains of terephthalic acid, butane diol, polytetramethylene glycol, and dimer acid.
