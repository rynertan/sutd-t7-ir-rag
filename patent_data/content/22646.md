## Description
The present invention relates to surface heating systems.Surface heating systems, at the present time are generally well known in the form of the familiar floor heating system.At the present time a floor heating system is laid down by providing a floor base and then laying a serpentine pattern of heating pipes thereon and covering the pipes so laid with a concrete screed. This system works well enough provided the temperature of the heating fluid is sufficiently above the ambient temperature of the room to be heated. The system works by the pipes heating the concrete overlay which in twrn releases heat into the room. The disadvantages, however, are that the heat capacity of the concrete overlay is quite high, so that there is a slow reaction to external influences and secondly, the complexity of the system is such that two separate trades are involved in laying the system namely the plumber laying and aipporting the pipes and connecting them up and the builder laying the cement overlay. Purthermore, a period of 4 to 6 weeks is necessary for the cement to care sufficiently before the heating system can be tested. With the advent of the cross linked polysthylenic pipe, a floor heating system can be contemplated using a continuous pipe which may now be run from a heating boiler through a floor heating system and back thereto without intermediate Joins. In view of the increasing cost of energy, there is a considerable pressure to increase the extraction of heat from low temperature sources such, for example, as solar energy, and heat pumps. These sources can only provide practical heat supplies in a situation where the mstmut temperature of the heating fluid is likely to be of the order of 270 to 350C, that is to say, only a low temperature difference between the heating fluid and the temperature of the space to be heated.With such small temperature differences, the traditional floor heating system would simply not provide an adeqnate heating system. Accordingly, it is necessary to look at means for obtaining the maximum heating potential with the lowest heat capacity of the system employed. According to the present invention there is provided a panel formed of a sheet of heat conducting material and configured to provide at least one pipe accommodating recess and at least one abutment portion extending substantially in spaced parallel relationship with said recess to define a portion transverse to the plane of the sheet adapted to abut or engage a support for said panel wherein the opening of the pipe accommodating recess is on the surface of said sheet towards the surface to be heated. The invention also includes a surface heating system comprising a plurality of spaced supports, one Or more panels in accordance with the invention formed of a heat conducting material to define a heating surface and a conduit formed of a cross linked polyolefinic material. The panel may include bias means for retaining said panel in juxtaposition with said spaced supports.It is preferred that the panel is formed from an almainium sheet to provide a central recess for the conduit.recess is preferably less than the diameter of the conduit so that the relative flexibility or resilience of the shaped aluminium sheet yields as the conduit is pressed into the recess and returns under its resilience to retain the conduit therein. The surface to carry the heating system may preferably have a plurality of spaced supports constitnted by battens disposed in spaced parallel relationship. The conduit support may be fluted to provide the abutment surface which e zYiXD with an edge of an adjacent batten. The fluted portion may have a longitudinal edge flange constituting a support portion adapted to overlay said batten and securing nans, such, for ernple, as staples or nails, may be driven into the overlaying flange to maintain the panel in place. The depth of the batten shoula be sufficient to maintain the conduit and conduit support member spaced from the surface from which the structure stands. It is then possible to provide a simple overlay of a floor cladding material over the batten to complete a floor or indeed a wall or ceiling system. Insulating may be provided on the side of the panel away from the surface to be heated. Following is a description by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying formal drawings of one embodiment in accordance with the present invention. Figure 1 is a section through a panel in accordance with the present invention Figure 2 is a plan view of the panel of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a section through a floor system in accordance with the present invention I Figure 4 shows the system applied to a wall and Figure 5 is an alternative configuration of the panel ofFigure 1. Referring first to Figure 3, a typical floor system comprises a laterally extending Joist 10 carrying a plurality of battens 11 extending across the joist substantially perpendicular thereto. The spacing between each Joist accommodates a panel 12 having a central pipe accommodating recess 13 and outwardly thereof a longitudinal extending fluting 14 comprising an inclined recess portion 15 extending downwardly t rv a outer surface 16 and having an abutment surface 17 substantially perpendicular to outer surface 16 and having an abutment surface 17 substantially perpendicular to outer surface 16.The fluting 14 has outwardly thereof a longitudinally extending flange 18 substantially coplanar with outer surface 16 of panel 12 See Figure 1 . In the embodiment of Figure 5 the panel 12 has a pipe accommodating recess 13 as before the fluting 14 is replaced by a longitudinally extending trough 24 each trough being formed by a first portion 25 substantially perpendicular to the plane of outer surface 16, a second portion 26 at right angles to the first portion and a third portion 27 in spaced parallel relationship with said first portion, so that said first portion 25 and or said third portion 27 is adapted to abut or engage with an adjacent support. The panel 12 is disposed between adjacent battens 77 I in spaced parallel relationship therewith and is located therebetween by means of abutment surfaces 17 Juxtaposed the corresponding longitudinal edge 19 of an adJacent batten.The flange 18 overlaying the apper surface 20 of the batten 11. A pipe 21 formed of a cross linked polyethylenic material is pressed into the recess 13 for accommodation therein and the floor covering 22 is then applied over this system to complete this construction. The member 12 is formed of aluminium sheet having a thickness of 0.5 to 0.7 millimetres and preferably 0.6 millimetres and serves to distribute heat from the conduit 21. In operation it has been found that such a system is readily assembled. Where used in a wall or ceiling system seeFigure 4 staples or like securing means may be driven into flanges 18 to secure the panel 12 to the battens 11. In this way a large heating surface may be employed thereby enabling a low temperature heating fluid to be circulated within the pipes to effect the heating of the room or like area. In this way low temperature heating water may be employed using a heat source such as a heat pump, or solar energy. A further advantage i8 that such a system can be readily installed into an existing house. The total depth of such an installation is under 3 centimetres. Thus, the relative rise in floor level would be comparatively small compared with the 8 or 10 centimentres necessary for a pipe having a concrete overlay.
