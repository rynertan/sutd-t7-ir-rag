## Description
A method and a device for fibre parallelisation and specifically for cotton fibres and synthetics Introductory remarks The above mentioned invention regards a method and a device for the parallelisation of fibres which being fed rectilinearly are changing direction and placed one on top of the other in parallel form.Aiming to obtain a parallelisation of fibres moving rectilinearly, we devised a system based on a simple geometric model without moving parts and complex mechanisms and employing the principles and properties of electrostatic fields. Accordingly, we invented a simple practical arrangement whicb can be useful for further applications.Below is a description of the method and of the embodiments of the device according to the invention on the basis of the attached set of drawings. Figure 1 shows in perspective the method of fibre parallelisation.Separated fibres for instance cotton fibres are fed through the feeder 1 into the semicylindrical area which is formed by a concave cylinder 2 made from insulating material, for instance plexiglass and the metallic semicylindrical strip 3 which is formed in the upper part in such a way as to allow the fibres to enter freely without being obstructed.The fibres, with the help of an air suction device 4 descend in parallel to axis AA gradually changing their direction to one perpendicular to the above axis because of fordes generated by an electrostatic field which is formed from the friction of the body of the device and by means of the metallic strip 3 inside the device. Thus, fibres are accumulated in parallel form at the groove at the bottom of the metallic strip 5 and with the aid of air suction are drawn through the slot 7 at the bottom of the groove of the above mentioned strip. What happens thereafter depends on the specific applications that the fibres will be used for.The semicircular metallic washer 6 exists for the purpose of creating the appropriate conditions of the electrostatic field required for the parallelisation of the fibres.Figure 2 shows a section through axis AA with the semi cylindrical metallic strip 3 , the cylindrical shell 2 made of insulating material, the groove at bottom of the strip 5 , the semicircular washer 6 , the slot 7 , the air suction device 4 and the fibre feeder 1 . frescription and erDlanation of the phenomenonAs it is known, the insulating properties of the fibres, cellulose in the case of cotton, give to them the behavior of a bipole. polarization of a dielectric material That is, during their movement inside the device shsrxn in figs. 1 and 2, the fibres, because of friction with the immediate environment develop at their ends electrostatic loads and therefore behave like bipoles.As the fibres move through the electrical field which is formed by the surface of the metallic strip 3 and the inside surface of the cylinder 2 made of insulating material, they are reoriented by the influence of forces of electrical repulsion and attraction and thus assume the desired direction which is perpendicular to the one they originally had when they entered the interior of the device. Certainly, the length and the type of the fibre, the type of insulating material, the relative humidity of the interior and exterior environments and the properties of the air suction system compose the variables and parameters of the invention APPLICATIONS 1. Ring spinning processThis application of the invention is shown in Figure 3 attatched hereto. As shown, the fibres from the card sliver 8 are separated and thrown by the fibre feeder 1 into the fibre parallelisation system AMI. A suction system 4 which is installed on a perforated drum 9 causes the fibres to cohere on its external surface in a continuous and parallel form.As the perforate drum rotates, Xt moves tune web of parallel fibres towards the contact point with the pressure roll lO .The spinning of the yarn is thus reflected by the well knowh ring spinning process 11 .2. Open End spinning processAnother application of this invention is shown in Pig 4 and is the result of research for yarn production by open end methods to obtain the same, perhaps, better characteristics, strengh, and uniformity from those achieved with the ring. spinning method.The fibres of the card sliver 8 are separated and thrown by the fibre feeder 1 into the fibre parallelisation system SYl. Thus, with the aid of the air suction hole 4 the fibres cohere in parallel form in a perforated groove 7 . Initially, the sliver must be positioned on to the contact point of the delivery rollers 12 passing through a hole 13 and subsequently the system AM1 is put in rotary motion in such a direction as to obtain anS or Z yarn configuration as required . Thus, as AMI rotates and as the delivery rollers 12 pull the sliver we obtain a twisting of fibres that produces the yarn. This yarn is wound 14 into either cheese or cone form. The form and the inclination of groove 7 towards hole 13 and the air suction characteristics, give the required friction on the area 15 for the twist and yarn production 3. ODen End skinning process with double parallelisation of fibresThe third application of the invention is explained in fig. 5 and is the result of research to obtain improvements in mixing parallelised fibres during the spinning process. Descriptioa of the processThe fibres from the card sliver 8 are separated and thrown by the fibre feeder 1 Into the system cm3 for double fibre parallelisation. The air suction device 4 through the fixed protective shell 17 and the small holes of the double groove 7 forces the fibres to descend and be separated in two groups under the influence of the selfmaintaining electrostatic field, which is formed by the surfaces 2 and 18 of the insulating material, e.g. plexiglass, the two similar metal plates 19 and 20 of appropriate width and the metallic semicircular washer 6 , located at the bottom.When the fibres enter into the two grooves 7 and the system AM3 rotates, and as the delivery rollers 12 pull the sliver which originates from the two groups of parallelised fibres into the grooves 7 , yarn is produced and wound 14 into either cheese or cone form. The form and inclination of the two grooves, the air suction as well as the friction of the fibres on tne grooves, lead to the twisting and the production of Z or S type yarn with the appropriate rotation of the system.Finally, the yarn produced is wound on a bobbin with the use of an appropriate system 14 .4. Open End spinning process employing a special rotorThe fourth application of the invention is explained in fig. 6 and consists of the fiber paralleliser am , the rotor 21 the delivery system 12 and the cone formation 14 .Description of the yarn production processAs the fibres are positioned in parallel form by the sellmaintaining electrostatic field of the fibre parallelisation system AM1 into the groove 7, aided by the ar suction device 4j, they are lead through the tube 23 to the special rotor 21 , which is constructed as illustrated in cross section fig.6 . During the rotation of the rotor and due to the centrifugal force that is developed, the wound web touches the inner surface 24 of the stead friction cylender 22 .Accordingly, the friction of the fibres in area 24 forces them to twist. As the fibres are twisted together, on the one hand to the left in the groove, the twist slides and is loosened and on the other hand to the right towards the exit of the rotor, the twist remains, forming by the pulsing of the delivery cylinders a yarn ofZ or S type depending on the direction of rotation of the rotor. 5. Ooen End sninning system with two deliveries of pere The fifth application of the invention is explained in fig. 7 and consists of the fibre paralleliser ALUM lhich on its bottom has a thin slot 28 and under it a pair of perforated cylinders 25 , both rotating in the same direction. In addition, to the left and right of these and on the same axis XX the two pairs of cylinders 26 bearing the spinning equaliser discs 27 rotate in the same direction as well.Description of the processAs the fibres change direction while descending because of the selfmaintaining electrostatic field of the system AM1 , they pass through the thin slot 28 which is parallel to the axis XX and accumulate, by the means of the air suction device 4 , in the area of the longitudinal slots 29 of the suction, on the outer surface of the perforated cylinders 25 . If the fibres to are led the pairs of cylinders 26 , which rotate in the same direction, production of yarn will be obtained, as the delivery cylinders 12 will pull the yarn.It is evident that the fibers will be allotted to both sides, developing a resistance restraint which depends on the difference in the rotation speed of the pairs 25 and 26 .The holes of the perforated cylinders 25 are cleaned by an external suction system which cannot be seen in figure 7 .As mentioned above, the equilliser discs 27 are intended for the regulation of the spinning process. With the change in the direction of rotation of the pairs of cylinders 25 and 26 , a Z or S type yarn is produced which after passing through the delivery cylinders 12 is wound on a bobbin 14 .
