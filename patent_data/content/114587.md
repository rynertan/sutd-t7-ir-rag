# Method of afterburning flue gases and a device for implementation of same.

## Abstract
The method entails passing impure gases from an incineration plant such as a destructor, process furnace, crematory furnace or heating boiler, through a burner in an afterburner where through enforced mixture with combus tion gas they undergo complete combustion. The combus tion gas, depending on the composition of the flue gases, may consist of air or oxygen or either mixed with liquid petroleum gas. In the device for implementation of the method the flue gases and the combustion gas are introduced into a burner 10, 44 which blows the gas mixture into a flame bowl 3, 52 where temperatures in the 1500 2000 C range can be achieved. In one version of the invention the burner 44 produces a conical basketshaped flame in which the flue gases undergo complete combustion.
