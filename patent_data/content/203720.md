## Description
TOUR FLOW COL ROL SYSTEM FOR MX APERTtiRS CARD OR MICROFICHE FILM ELE NT. The present invention relates generally to electrophotography, and more particularly to an improved system of applying liquid developer or toner to an aperture card or microfiche type electrophotographic film element for developing an electrostatic latent image thereon. More specifically, the present invention relates to an improvement of the inclined toner flow control system for developing an electrostatic lat ent image upon an electrophotographic film element which was the objective of United States Patent 4,515,463 which issued on May 7, 1985. The embodiment of the inclined toner flow control system which is described within United States Patent 4,515,463 is particularly adapted for use with a roll cassette type film element wherein there is provided a development electrode having a portion thereof which is inclined relative to a vertical plane and a horizontal plane such that the electrode portion is disposed at an angle, relative to the horizontal plane, between 100 and 800, and preferably between 300 and 600.A glass backing plate, which is an integral or fixed part of the electrophotographic film cassette, for example, when roll film comprises the electrophotographic element upon which the latent image is produced, is also inclined at the same angle as the development electrode so as to be disposed parallel to the development electrode and thereby define therewith a channel within which the film is disposed and through which the liquid toner will flow In this manner, it is appreciated that the toner flow path will be inclined relative to the horizontal plane at an angle preferably between 300 and 60 . The particular inclined angle can of course be selected so as to optimize the control parameters of the flowing liquid toner. Toner is provided from a tank or reservoir and is conducted to the film development channel by means of a suitable pump. Due to the angular inclination or disposition of the film element and the toner flow channel defined between the film element and the development electrode, it is appreciated that when the liquid toner flows downwardly over the surface of the film element upon which the latent image has been produced and reaches the lower edge of the film element, gravity will cause the excess toner to be discharged from the film element. A toner shield is provided within the upper region of the film element and my conjunction with the develop ment electrode so as to define the initial portion of the toner flow path. Positive air pressure, supplied, for example, by means of a low power fan or blower, completely surrounds the film element within. the toner cell. This positive pressure air therefore serves to seat the film against the cassette glass backing or pressure plate as well as to aid in the definition of the side boundaries of the toner cell which are primarily defined by means of the development electrode as a result of the surface tension or capillarity established between the electrode and the toner.During the cyclic termination of the flow of the toner, that is, at the completion of the toning step of the process and prior to the fusing of the image upon the film element, the low pressure air flow also serves to initially dry the visible image upon the film by evaporating the excess toner carrier liquid. The visible image is therefore now in a stable state and ready to be fused at the fusing station of the apparatus. The aforenoted system is not particularly applicable for use with aperture card and microfiche type electrophotographic film elements, respectively, in view of the fact that, contrary to the toning and image development process characterizing the film roll cassette type system described hereinbefore wherein the toner is conducted transversely across the film element and discharged from the lower edge thereof under the influence of gravity, onfy a predetermined partial portion of the film element is to be toned and developed within an aperture card or microfiche type electrophotographic film element system, and wherein further, a free lower edge portion of the film element is not in fact accessible from which the excess toner may therefore be readily discharged.As a consequence of utilizing such a toner flow control system in connection with the development of latent images upon aperture card or microfiche type film elements, the toner tends to continue to flow along the film surface outside of the image frame region or area thereby deleteriously affecting the sur rounding mat or frame of the aperture card element, or the other image frames of the microfiche element. Accordingly, the present invention seeks to provide a new and improved toner flow control system for liquid toner utilized within apparatus for developing an electrostatic latent image upon an electrophotographic film element which may be in the form of either an aperture card or microfiche. The foregoing and other objectives of the present invention are achieved through the provision of a toner flow control system which is particularly adapted for use with aper tur ca ard microfiche type electrophotographic film elerrents, anA wherein, in particular, there is provided a passive plate or baffle which may be fabricated from a suitable metal or plastic material, which is disposed within the in mdiate vicintty of the aperture card or microfiche film element preferably so as to be spaced from the image surface thereof through a distance of only, approximately, 10 15 mils.In this manner, as a result of the surface tension characteristics established or defined between the passive plate or baffle, and the liquid toner, the excess toner will in fact be caused to leave the image surface of the film element and flow downwardly along the passive plate or baffle under the influence of gravity so as to be re circulated back into the toner reservoir or tank. It is of course to be appreciated that when an aperture card type film element is being processed within the apparatus, the aperture card will be disposed within the apparatus such that the low er edge of the aperture card image frame will be appropriate ly disposed within the immediate vicinity of the passive plate or baffle. In a similar manner, when a microfiche type film element is being processed within the apparatus, the micro fiche film element will be moved within the apparatus, in a conventional X Y movement mode, such that the lower edge of the particular image frame of the microfiche which is being developed at the particular time will be disposed within the immediate vicinity of the passive plate or baffle. Various other features, and attendant advan tages of the present invention will be more fully appreciated as the same becomes better understood from the following de tailed description when considered in connection with the ac comparing drawings, in which like reference characters designate like or corresponding parts throughout the different views, and wherein FIGURE 1 is a cross sectional view of a first embodiment of the new and improved toner flow control system constructed in accordance with the present invention and showing the cooperative parts thereof during a toner development portion of the entire image development process which is to be accomplished by the camerd processor apparatus with which the toner flow control system of the present invention is operatively associated, and as specifically applied to an aperture card type electrophotographic film element and FIGURE 2 is a cross sectional view similar to that of FIGURE 1 showing, however, a second embodiment of the new and improved toner flow control system constructed in accordance with the present invention and showing the cooperative parts thereof when the system of the present invention is adapted to be used in conjunction with the image development processing of a microfiche type electrophotographic film element. Considering now the present invention, it is to be understood that the new and improved toner flow control system of the present invention is to be utilized within camera processor apparatus which is capable of developing an electrostatic latent image upon various different types of electrophotographic elements or media, and more specifically, in accordance with the principles and structural arrangement of the present invention, there is disclosed two embodiments of the new and improved toner flow control system of the present invention which are especially acted for the develont of electrostatic latent images upon aperture card and microfiche type electrophotographic film elements or media.It is to be understood further that in connection with the processing or development of a microfiche type media microfilm, wherein multiple images are to be individually developed upon the particular film element in well known arrays, the toner flow control system of the present invention is of course to be utilized for the development of any one, or each, of the images of such arrayed microfiche image frames. With reference now being made to the drawings, and more particularly to FIGURE 1 thereof, there is shown a first embodiment of the new and improved toner flow control system of the present invention, as generally indicated by the refe rence character 110, and as applied to the development of electrostatic latent images upon an aperture card type elec trophotographic film element 112.It is seen that the film medium 114 of the aperture card element 112 is mounted within an annular mat 115 so as to comprise a conventional aperture card microfilm element, and the aperture card element 112 is of course further adapted to be mounted within a suitable transport mechanism, not shown, which will transport the card element 112 between exposure and charging, toning, and fusing stations in accordance with the latent image processing of the electrophotographic film media.In particular, the toner flow control system of the present invention is disposed at a toning station to which the particular film element 112 being developed at such station has been transported from a charging and exposure station, not shown, and upon completion of the toning process step of the overall development process, the toned film element 112, with its film media 114 therein, will be advanced to a fusing station, also not shown, whereby the developed image will be fused to the photoconductive layer of the film medium 114. The aforenoted mounting and transport system for the film elerent 112 is provided with a pressure or basing plate 120 against which the film element 112 will be disposed or seated, and means1 not shown, and which may be, for example, a low power fan or blower, is provided for supplying positive pressure air flow to the aforenoted three charging and expo sure, toning, and fusing stations whereby the film element 112 will be subjected to such positive pressure air flow at each of the three aforenoted processing stations so as to in fact press the film element 112 against the backing plate 120.In the instance of both embodiments of the present invention wherein the film element is either an aperture card or microfiche type film element, the aforenoted positive air pressure additionally facilitates the insertion of the aperture card or microfiche into the camera processor apparatus by causing the card or fiche to be inserted in a free floating mode.In particular, this insertion mode tends to facilitate insertion of the film element without scratching the film surface as well as to clean the film element with respect to loose dixt or dust particles tending to adhere to the surface thereof. The positive pressure at the toning station also serves to initially dry the developed image upon the film element media 114 so as to render the image stable, and this positive pressure at the toning station is denoted at 126. With continued reference being made to FIGURE 1, it is seen that the toner flow control apparatus of the present invention s first embodiment further comprises a development electrode 128 which is uniquely provided with a toner contacting portion 130 inclined with respect to a horizontal plane through means of an angle between 10 and 800, and preferably between 300 and 600. It is seen that the front face of the film pressure or backing plate 120 is similarly inclined with respect to the horizontal plane so as to be disposed parallel to the inclined portion 130 of the development electrode, and the film element 112, pressed or seated upon or against the backing or pressure plate 120, is therefore likewise inclined with respect to the horizontal plane.In this manner, a toner flow control channel 132 is thereby defined between the film element 112 and the development electrode portion 130 so as to also have the requisite degree of inclination. The development electrode assembly 128 is mounted on top of a liquid toner reservoir or tank 134 in which, and from which, liquid toner 136 is conducted and withdrawn in a recirculatory system aided in part by means of a suitable pump P which may, for example, be disposed within the liquid toner reservoir or tank 134 in a submerged state. The pump P discharges the liquid toner 136 into an upstanding conduit 138 which is defined between the rear side of the development electrode 128 and a toning station housing housing 139, and the conduit 138 is, in turn, fluidically connected to a substantially horizontally disposed toner supply chamber 140 which is defined between the upper surface of the development electrode 128 and the housing 139, an overhanging portion 142 of housing 139 serving to define a toner shield member.The toner flow control channel 132 is fluidically connected to the toner supply chamber 140, and consequently, as may readily be appreciated, liquid toner 136 is recirculated through the toning station by means of pump P which discharges the toner 136 into upstanding conduit 138 and supply chamber 140, whereupon the same flows downwardly through control channel 132 so as to be in contact with both the inclined portion 130 of the development electrode 128 and the film medium 114 of the aperture card film element 112. Due to the particular configuration of the development electrode 128, specifically a rearwardly inclined portion 129 thereof which serves to define, along with inclined portion 130 of development electrode 128, the lower free edge of inclined electrode portion 130, toner 136 will tend to drip off and be discharged from, under the influence of gravity acting in a vertical plane, the lower free edge or corner section 131 of development electrode 128 so as to enter a drain channel 144 which is fluidically con nected to toner reservoir or tank 134. While it is therefore appreciated that excess toner discharge into drain channel 144 is efficiently effected upon the development electrode side of control channel 132 due to the provision of the lower free edge corner section 131 of development electrode 128, and the inclination of development electrode portion 130 from which the excess toner may be discharged, at corner section 131, under the influence of gravity acting within the vertical plane, such is not readily the case with respect to such excess toner 136 upon the film medium side of flow channel 132 in view of the fact that, contrary to the embodiment of United States Patent 4,515,463 wherein the film medium comprised a film roll cassette having a lower free edge portion from which excess toner could in fact drip off or be discharged under the influence of gravitational forces, film medium 114 does not have a lower free edge portionTo the contrary, film medium 114 is surrounded by means of the mat or framework 115 onto the lower portion of which the aforenoted excess toner would tend to be conducted under surface tension forces established by means of the film medium 114 and mat 115 with respect to the toner 136. Consequently, in order to eradicate the foregoing defilement of the film element mat or framework 115, there is provided in accordance with the present invention, as applied to this first embodiment encompassing the use of an aperture card type electrophotographic film element 112, an upstanding passive plate or baffle 145 which is disposed atop the toner reservoir or tank 134 such that the upper free edge portion 147 of the passive plate or baffle 145 is disposed within the immediate vicinity of the lower edge portion 149 of the image frame defined upon the aperture card film medium 114. In particular, the upper free edge portion 147 of the passive plate or baffle 145 is separated from the surface of the lower edge portion 149 of film medium 114 by means of a distance of approximately 10 15 mils, or a proxir ely 1 3 of a millimeter. In this manner, as a result of the baffle or plate 145 being disposed in a non contact mode with respect to the film medi um 114, smearing of the toner 136 upon the film medium 114, or other deleterious effects upon the developed film medium image, as would be encountered if the baffle or plate 145 was disposed in contact with the surface of the film medium 114, such as, for example, scratching or scarring of the film medium surface, is effectively prevented.Alternatively, the disposition of the plate or baffle 145 within the aforenoted immediate vicinity of the film medium surface portion 149 serves to establish desired surface tension characteristics between the passive plate or baffle 145 and the liquid toner 136 such that the latter, flowing downwardly through the flow control channel 132, and upon encountering the upper free edge portion 147 of the baffle or plate 145, will readily flow downwardly along the interior surface of baffle or plate 145, as disposed within drain channel 144, for recirculatory deposit back within the reservoir or tank 134, without continuing to proceed further downwardly along or upon aperture card element 112 so as to thereby be prevented from encountering the aperture card element annular mat or frame 115.The thickness of passive plate or baffle 145 may be approximately 10 30 mils, and it is to be emphasized at this junction that what is meant by means of the term passive is that such is to be distinguished from an active system wherein, for example, movement or moving components would be required and are utilized, such as, for example, within high vacuum suction systems which would ordinarily be required in order to achieve discharge or withdrawal of the excess toner from the film medium surface, or still yet further, movable seal systems which require seal means to be forcefully disposed into surface contact with the film medium surface in order to effectively prevent continued flow of the excess toner downwardly along the film medium surface beyond the boundary of the image frame being developed.To the contrary, with the passive baffle or plate means of the present invention, provision of moving com ponents, or the provision of means for developing high, negative pressure fluid flow systems, is eliminated while nevertheless permitting or facilitating the effective discharge or withdrawal of excess toner fluid 136 from the surface of the film medium 114, under the influence of gravitational forces acting within a vertical plane, as indicated at 146.It is to be emphasized still further that while various other factors characteristic of the present invention indeed aid in the desired discharge or withdrawal of the excess toner 136 from the film medium surface region 149 at the denoted point of discharge 146, such as, for example, the positive air pressure plenum 126 surrounding the toner station, or the image frame region pre determinedly defined, in effect, by means of the charge pattern initially impressed upon the film medium at the exposure charge station, and to which charge pattern the liquid toner is naturally attracted and therefore tends to adhere in accordance with well known electrophotographic principles, the disposition or provision of the passive baffle or plate 145 in accordance with the present invention is in fact the single most critical factor which renders the apparatus embodiment disclosed within FIGURE 1 to be effectively operative and commercially feasible. With reference now being made to FIGURE 2 of the drawings, there is disclosed a second embodiment of the present invention which is generally designated by the reference character 210, and it is noted at this point that like or corresponding components parts, relative to those disclosed in connection with the embodiment of FIGURE 1, have been given the same reference character numbers except for the fact that those characters representing components within the second em bo iment of FIGURE 2 have been denoted by numbers within a 200 series.The embodiment of FIGURE 2 is adapted to be used in conjunction with the development of images upon a microfiche type electrophotographic microfilm element 212 which is seen to comprise an array of image frames 214 arranged in ro s and columns as is conventional, with the image frame areas 214 separated by non image regions 215. The microfiche element 212 is adapted to be supported within a suitable X Y transport system, not shown, which is capable of moving the element 212 in both the X and Y directions as is also conventional so as to position any particular one of the images frames 214 at a particular processing station, such as, for example, the charge exposure station, the toning station, and the fusing station.In FIGURE 2, a particular image frame 214 disposed within the central horizontally extending row of the microfiche element 212 is shown disposed opposite the inclined portion 230 of the development electrode 228 at the toning station so as to be able to have its latent image developed in accordance with the techniques described hereinbefore.As was the case with the aperture card film element 112 of the first embodiment of the present invention as illustrated within FIGURE 1, there is provided a passive plate or baffle means 245 which is disposed within the immediate vicinity of the toned surface of the microfiche element 212 such that proper toning development of, for example, the central image frame 214 disposed opposite the inclined development electrode portion 230 can be achieved without excess toner 236 continuing to flow downwardly along the surface of the film element 212 whereby such excess liquid toner 236 might otherwise affect the toning, development, and image projection properties and qualities of, for example, the lowermost image frame 214 disposed beneath the central image frame 214 presently being processed. In particular, and as will readily be appreciated, the upper free edge portion 247 of the passive plate or baffle 245 will be disposed within the immediate vicinity of the lower edge region 249 of the particular image frame 214 of the microfiche element 212 being developed at the toning station in order to achieve the aforenoted results. Thus, it may be seen that the present invention is unicuels capable of controlling the flow of liquid toner dur ing the processing of electrophotographic microfilm elements regardless of whether the element comprises, for example, an aperture card or microfiche, without the requirement of substantial differential pressure or vacuum suction means, toner cell definition seal devices, or the like, and in the particular instance of aperture card and microfiche type film elements, the aforenoted processing of the latent images upon the film elements is achieved without deleteriously affecting the surrounding mat or frame of the aperture card, or other image frames of the microfiche. Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the present invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.
