# Pretreatment of metal sheets for improving the adhesion of paint systems, and metal sheets so obtained.

## Abstract
Pre treatment for improving the adhesion of paint systems to metal sheets such as the steel sheets used in the automotive industry. The pre treatment is applied to the metal sheets before the latter are submitted to the surface conversion cycle e.g. phosphating and to the subsequent painting process. According to the invention the pre treatment consists in inserting the steel sheet alternately as cathode and anode of an electrolytic cell containing essentially a 0.5 M 2.0 M sodium sulphate aqueous solution. The operating temperature is selected between 20 C and 100 C. The current density flowing through the cell ranges from 1 to 50 A dmÂ². Treatment time is selected between 0.1 and 30 seconds. The invention permits the removal of both organic residues and inorganic inclusions with one comprehensive treatment only.
