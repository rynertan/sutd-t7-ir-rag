## Description
The present invention relates to a premix containing starch and vital gluten and which is useful in the manufacture of high quality confectionery. The invention also extends to starch based confectioneries containing or prepared from such a premix. In general, confectioneries such as sponge cakes, steam bread, cake doughnuts and biscuits are made using flour as one of the main raw materials. The kind of flour used is usually cake flour, which has a low content of gluten and which has a low viscoelasticity when made into dough. Depending on the kind of confectionery involved, other ingredients such as sugar, table salt, fat and oil, and eggs are usually added. In accordance with the present invention it has been found that high quality, starch based confectioneries can be obtained using a premix containing A corn or potato starch and B vital gluten hereinafter referred to as PL gluten having a bound monoacyl glycerophospholipid content of at least 30 mol , based on the total content of bound phospholipid, with the proviso that when the bound monoacyl glycerophospholipid content is less than 50 mol the total content of bound phospholipid is at least 2 W W . It will thus be seen that the confectioneries provided in accordance with this invention are essentially starch based and contain a vital gluten the bound monoacyl glycerophospholipid content of which is higher than in ordinary commercially available vital gluten. A process for the production of such a gluten is described in detail in EP A 0134658 to which reference should be made. Briefly, in accordance with that disclosure PL gluten is obtained by adding phospholipase A hereinafter referred to as PL A to flour in the ratio of 10² 10⁴ units per 1 kg of flour, further adding water thereto and kneading mixture with water to remove starch and the like. PL gluten can also be obtained by treating a mixture of phospholipids, flour and PL A containing an amount of phospholipid of from 0.1 10 based on the weight of the flour, in the same way as given above, or by converting phospholipid to a phospholipid having a high content of monoacyl glycerophospholipid with PL A, and binding the resultant phospholipid to gluten protein in a PL gluten producing process. In the corn or potato starch based confectionery premixes of this invention the amount of PL gluten will usually be in the range 0.5 20 parts by weight per 100 parts of starch, and, in addition to the starch and PL gluten, confectionery premixes in accordance with this invention may, and usually will, contain one or more other conventional confectionery ingredients such as bread flour hard flour , noodle flour semi hard flour , and commercially available vital gluten, i.e. a conventional gluten having a much lower content of bound monoacyl glycerophospholipid, as well as sugar, table salt, fat, oil, skim milk, eggs, emulsifiers, flavours, etc. By use of a premix according to this invention, starch based confectioneries sponge cake, steam bread, cake doughnuts, cookies, etc. of good quality can be produced. The present invention is illustrated by the following Examples wherein all numerical values refer to parts by weight unless otherwise indicated. In the test results, specific volume is measured by the rapeseed displacement method, whilst grain, texture, softness, appearance and colour were assessed by sensory evaluation. The properties of the resultant sponge cake are shown in Table 1. As is apparent from Table 1, the product in the test group II was of the same quality as the conventional flour based sponge, test group I. The properties of the resulting biscuits are shown in Table 2. As will be seen, using potato starch and PL gluten, Test group IV biscuits were obtained of good appearance, softness and texture. Properties of the resulting doughnuts are shown in Table 3. As is apparent from Table 3, when corn starch and PL gluten were used Test group II instead of cake flour Test group I , the degree of oil absorption of the product was a little higher but the texture is better. Using corn starch and conventional gluten Test group III the result is generally poor. The PL gluten used in the foregoing examples was obtained as follows Further, to the powdery gluten was added 100 ml of the modified phospholipid dispersion, and mixed with stirring. The mixture was lyophilized and pulverised into a powdery gluten. The above mentioned procedure where to the resultant powdery gluten was added 100 ml of the modified phospholipid dispersion and powdered through lyophilization was repeated further two times. Totally, 400 ml of the modified phospholipid was added. The bound phospholipid content of the vital gluten PL gluten thus obtained was 3.5 w w and the bound monacyl glycerophospholipid content was 68 mol .
