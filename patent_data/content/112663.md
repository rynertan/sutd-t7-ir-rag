# Nuclear magnetic resonance methods and apparatus.

## Abstract
A multi slice method of NMR imaging wherein a number of discrete slices S₁, S₂, S₃, S₄ are excited simultaneously by using the usual field gradient Gz but an r. f. pulse B₁ which is a mix of a number of pulses of different discrete frequencies, f₁, f₂, f₃, f₄, and recovering data in the presence of an alternating gradient G₂z in the same direction as used to establish the slices such that discrete spin echo signals of different frequency occur for each slice. Apparatus for use in the method is also disclosed.
