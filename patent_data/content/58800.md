# Hydraulic control circuit for loader of thin wall spline rolling machine.

## Abstract
A hydraulic control circuit 10 for operating a loader 12 of a machine for splining an annular thinwall sleeve of a power transmission member is disclosed as including valving 116 for communicating supply and return conduits 102, 116 with load and unload cylinders 14, 16 to provide loading and unloading movements. Load and unload valves 118, 120 of the valving have load cycle positions where the load cylinder drives both the loading and unloading members 26, 28 which clamp a thin wall member during such movement to provide loading thereof for splining. In an unload cycle position of the valves, both the load and unload cylinders are hydraulically driven in an unloading direction opposite to the loading movement. The loading and unloading members 26, 28 are moved away from each other by their associated cylinders in an index cycle of the valves to permit indexing of a load table 30 under the operation of an index valve 162 of the circuit.
