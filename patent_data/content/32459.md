## Abstract
Tetrakis 3 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionyl oxymethyl methane having a novel crystal structure such that its X ray diffraction pattern obtained by X ray analysis using Cu KÎ± rays shows a sharp peak at a diffraction angle 20 10.90 . This can be prepared by a transesterify ing methyl or ethyl 3 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate with pentaerythritol in the presence of a com pound of the formula The compound of novel crystal structure has improved handling properties and finds use as an antioxidant for polyolefins.
