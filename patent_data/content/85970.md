# POSITIONING MECHANISM FOR A FLOPPY DISK DRIVE READ WRITE HEAD CARRIAGE

## Abstract
A positioning mechanism for a floppy disk drive, read write head carriage is disclosed. The positioning mechanism converts the rotary motion of a stepper motor into the linear motion of the read write head carriage by driving a cylindric al capstan and the carriage with a flexible, non stretchable band. The band is wound around the capstan and fixed thereto with its opposite end extending from the capstan along the line which is tangent to the capstan and parallel to the path of movement of the carriage. The opposite ends of the band are rigidly attached to the carriage. Proper tension is maintained in the band by selcting the dimensions and materials of the positioning mechanism such that the system is thermally compensated.
