# Process for production of benzene phosphonic dihalide.

## Abstract
Benzene phosphonic dihalide is produced by oxygena tion of phenyl phosphonous dihalide according to the follow ing reaction The reaction is conducted at a temperature from about 0 C to about 200 C. Charcoal is added to the reaction mixture when impure phenyl phosphonous dihalide is used as a start ing material. The product has high purity and is stable at high temperatures. It can be used as an intermediate to prepare flame retardants, insecticides, pesticides and piasticisers.
