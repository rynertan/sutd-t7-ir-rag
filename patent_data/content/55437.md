# A continuous process for the production of polystyrene foamed articles.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for producing econo mically shaped article of polystyrene foam with a small wall thickness and sufficient strength by continuous simple operation including a short forming cycle in which the sheet of polystyrene foam having a bulk density of 0.15 to 0.7 g cmÂ³, a thickness of 0.3 to 1.0 mm, to 5 to 20 cell membranes widthwise of the sheet and a draw ratio of up to 1.25 and containing 0.03 to 0.3 mole kg of the residual gas of the blowing agent is formed by an extruder and utilized to produce the shaped article.
