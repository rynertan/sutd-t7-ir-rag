# A tumble dryer for the drying of laundry.

## Abstract
A tumble dryer for the drying of laundry comprises a drum 2 arranged in a housing 1 and driven by a motor 3 , heating means 7 for heating the air entering the dryer and being guided through the drum 2 , first and second tempera ture sensing means 12, 13 for sensing the temperatures of the air led into the drum 2 and being discharged from the drum 2 , and control means connected to the temperature sensing means 12, 13 for energizing and de energizing the heating means 7 and the drum motor 3 . In order to ensure a cooling down period dependent on the drum content and humidity to achieve a desired remaining humidity of the drum content the air led to the drum is guided for preheating before passing the heating means over and around the drum 2 , the first temperature sensing means 12 is arranged for sensing the temperature of the preheated air 10 upstream of the heating means 7 and the control means de energizes the heating means 7 upon reaching a first presettable tempera ture difference of the preheated and the discharged air 10, 8 and de energizes the drum motor 3 upon reaching a second temperature difference of the preheated and the discharged air 10, 8 .
