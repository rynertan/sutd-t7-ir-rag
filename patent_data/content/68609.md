The present invention also provides a method of treating bacterial infections in humans or domestic mammals which comprises the administration of a compositions of this invention. Commonly the infection treated will be due to a strain of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella aeroqenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus sp., Bacteroides fragilis or the like. The organisms believed to be most readily treated by an antibacterially effective amount of a compound of this invention is Staphylococcus aureus. The other organisms named are more readily treated by using a synergistically effective amount of the compound of the invention and a penicillin or cephalosporin. The administration of the two components may take place separately but in general we prefer to use a composition containing both the synergist and the penicillin or cephalosporin. The indications for treatment include respiratory tract and urinary tract infections in humans and mastitis in cattle. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I or a salt or ester thereof, which process comprises the reaction of a compound of the formula III EMI13.1 wherein Ra is a carboxy protecting group, and X is a displaceable group, with a source of thiocyanate ion and thereafter if necessary i removing any carboxy protecting group Ra, ii converting the product into a salt or ester Suitably the source of thiocyanate ion is a metal thiocyanate, for example an alkali metal thiocyanate such as potassium thiocyanate or sodium thiocyanate. In an alternative the source of thiocyanate may be a polymersupported thiocyanate such as a macroporous resin. Suitably X is a readily displaceable group, for example halo such as chloro or bromo, or a sulphonyloxy moiety, for example C16 alkyl or aryl sulphonyloxy, such as a mesylate or tosylate, or X is a carboxylate moiety, for example a C 1 6 alkanoyloxy group optionally substituted by 1 to 3 halogen atoms, in particular acetoxy, dichloroacetoxy and trichloroacetoxy. Suitably the reaction of the compound of the formula III with the source of thiocyanate will occur in an aprotic solvent, such as dimethylformamide or acetonitrile, at a non extreme temperature for example between 500C and 5O0C, more usually between 10 C and 3O0C and preferably at ambient temperature. Suitably carboxy protecting groups Ra include ester derivatives of the carboxylic acid. The derivative is preferably one which may be readily cleaved at a later stage of the reaction.
