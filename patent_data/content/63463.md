# Lockable control lever arrangement.

## Abstract
A lockable control lever arrangement in which a pivotally mounted control lever 10 is provided with linkages 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 for connecting the control lever with one or more functions to be controlled. A locking device 60 is provided for locking the lever in a given position. The locking device includes a first locking formation 23, 24 operatively connected with each of the linkages, a locking member 20, 21, 22 having a second locking formation 21a, 22a engageable with the first locking formation to lock the control lever 10 in the given position, and a manually operable operating means 26, 27, 28, 29 for moving the locking member to bring the first and second formations into engagement to lock the control lever. The control lever arrangement is particularly applicable to the operation of hydraulic valves which control the loaders and diggers of industrial tractors.
