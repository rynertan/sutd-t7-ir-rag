# An arrangement for bonding an elastic ribbon to a plastics web with the aid of an adhesive.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an arrangement for bonding an elastic ribbon 51 under tension to a plastics web 10 along a curved path thereon with the aid of an adhesive, in the manufacture of diapers or like articles. The ribbon is introduced into a given curved path on a cylindrical drum 15 . Arranged in the given path are suction openings which communicate with a suction source and are effective in holding the ribbon firmly by suction along the whole of its length, therewith preventing the ribbon from sliding relative the drum and the plastics web and from twisting or tilting on the drum despite the tension in the ribbon. Means 89 are provided for breaking the connection between the suction openings and the suction source as the suction openings pass the end point of a given distance on the drum 15 .
