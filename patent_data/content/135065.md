# Star sensor using CCD.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a star sensor for use in the attitude control of satellites. The star sensor comprises a charge coupled device 12 for detecting the light rays of a star, a filter circuit 22 for filtering the output of said charge coupled device 12 , a zero cross detector 23 , a reference voltage generator 16 and a voltage comperator 24 for detecting the points where the voltage of the output of the filter circuit 22 is equal to a predetermined level, and an A D converter 19 , a multiplexer circuit 20 and a data processor circuit 21 for providing signals representative of the brightness and position of the star. The star sensor requires a buffer memory of small capacity and is capable of accurately determining the central position of the star image.
