# Low temperature fired dielectric ceramic composition with a flat temperature characteristic.

## Abstract
A dielectric ceramic composition having a dielectric constant greater than 2400, said composition consisting essentially of from about 91.6 to about 95.5 weight percent barium titanate, from about 0.91 to about 1.49 weight percent niobium pentoxide, from about 0.18 to about 0.31 weight percent cobalt oxide, from about 1.04 to about 1.87 weight percent bismuth trioxide, from about 0.68 to about 1.23 weight percent titanium dioxide, from about 0.67 to about 1.20 weight percent lead oxide, from about 0.26 to about 0.46 weight percent boron oxide, from about 0.82 to about 1.49 weight percent zinc oxide, and from 0 to about 0.11 weight percent manganese dioxide, wherein the capaci tance of said composition varies with temperature about 15 percent or less from the capacitance at 25 C at temperatures between about 55 C and about 125 C.
