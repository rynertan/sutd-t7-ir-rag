## Abstract
A connector i for flexible sewer cleaning rods includes male and female coupling members 3, 5 engageable by transverse sliding. A locking pin 33 extends through a transverse bore 23 in the member 5 and through a transverse slot 15 in the head 13 . The pin is rotatable or longitudinally slidable to a position where an appropriate cutout 37 allows the head 13 to slide out of the slot 21 .
