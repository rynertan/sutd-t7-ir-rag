# Fire resistant container.

## Abstract
A fire resistant container for protecting magnetic media such as floppy discs comprises a base and a cover. The base is in the form of an outer casing 1 and an inner container 2 separated by thermal insulation material 10 which is maintained under compressive stress so as to retain the inner container in position within the outer casing and to permit the insulation material to expand when the outer casing expands as a result of exposure to high temperature. The inner container 2 may have a hollow wall which is filled with wax 7 . The cover 20 may comprise a dished outer cover 21 , an inner cover 25 and thermal insulation material 22 which is maintained under compressive stress.
