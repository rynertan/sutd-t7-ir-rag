# CONTINUOUS SOCKET WITH MATCHING CONNECTING PLUG

## Abstract
The invention covers a continuous socket and a connect ing plug thereof. The socket consists of a strip 1 made of insulating material provided with two internal housings 2, 3 situated lengthwise and opposed, designed to enclose two electrical conductors 4 and 5 , and a lengthwise opening 6 obtained on a face thereof and intended to gain access to these conductors. The plug designed to be used in conjunc tion with said socket consists of a container of insulating material, provided with four openings diametrally opposed two by two, where two bracket members are installed, each comprising an insulating and a conducting arm, the free ends of them protruding from said openings. The conducting ends are reclining type and can be brought back elastically from the protruding position by the action of pressure exerted simultaneously on the corresponding insulating ends of said bracket members.
