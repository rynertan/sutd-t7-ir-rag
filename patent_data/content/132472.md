# Medicated products containing a magnesium trisilicate adsorbent with a medicament drug adsorbed thereon.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a medicated product comprising a magnesium trisilicate adsorbent having a flake like structure with multiple interstitial spaces, and which has, per gram, a surface area of at least 400 m², preferably at least 440 m², more preferably from 440 to 600 m² and a medicament drug adsorbate adsorbed onto the mag nesium trisilicate adsorbent, wherein the amount of drug adsorbed is in the range from 1 to 20 by weight of the medicated product. The use of the magnesium trisilicate having the specified characteristics masks the taste of the medicament drug in the medicated product.
