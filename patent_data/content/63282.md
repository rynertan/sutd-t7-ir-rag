# Dual mode meter reading apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention provides a dual mode meter reading apparatus including a first dial register encoder 36 and a second meter pulse encoder 38 both responsive to the measuring element 14 of an integrating meter. Electronic data registers 60, 61 store both non volatile dial totalized readings and higher resolution pulse augmented readings encoded by the first and second encoders, respectively. Comparison means and a selective logic readout of the two meter readings reduces erroneous meter reading outputs.
