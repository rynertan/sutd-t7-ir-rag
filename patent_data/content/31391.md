## Description
ATTENnANT CONTROLLED SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATIC ENABLE AND MONITORING OF FUEL DISPENSERS. The present invention relates to an attendant controlled terminal for automatic enablement and monitoring of fuel dispensers, and more particularly relates to a cash credit sales control terminal for use in a gasoline service station, which monitors and controls the amount of dispensed fuel from a plurality of gasoline pumps, combines miscellaneous sales information to the sale amount of a selected one of the pumps, prints individual customer receipts, automatically verifies a customer s credit status, and provides certain accounting and inventory functions. Heretofore, equipment has been provided in service stations which permits the remote display of gasoline transactional information, i.e., the display of the dollar amount and gallonage of a pump transaction on a display console which may be located in the sales office of the service station, outside the view of the pump dispenser. To utilize this information, however, the attendant must manually transcribe the displayed information onto a receipt invoice for presentation to the customer. For credit transactions, the attendant must manually transfer the account number from the customer s embossed credit card onto the receipt, normally by means of a hand operated embossing machine, and transcribe on the receipt the appropriate sales information. Verification of the customer s credit is often done manually via a printed bad accounts booklet, telephonically or electronically via a connection to a dedicated, on line credit authorization network. All of these manual operations are timeconsuming to the attendant. With the recent trend toward single attendant operated, self service stations, one of the problems which arises is that customers are kept waiting in line to pay the single attendant while the attendant transacts business with previous customers. This time consumption problem is further exacerbated, where the customer desires to purchase miscellaneous items in addition to his gasoline purchase, especially when such purchases are by credit card. The attendant s transactional operations are not only time consuming, they are subject to error, illegibility and fraud. The attendant must have intelligence and training to transact business quickly with the customer so that customers are not kept waiting. The prior art discloses a fully automated vending type apparatus for the dispensement of fuel, described in U.S. Patent 3,786,421 issued to W. Wostl onJanuary 15, 1974. The Wostl device provides a step forward in the art, eliminating the service station attendant altogether by permitting self vending of the fuel and self payment by the customer. Wostl provides an automated service station having a control console into which a customer inserts his credit card. Identifying indicia on the credit card are read, and signals indicative of those identifying indicia are transmitted to a data bank in which is stored credit information on holders of credit cards. If the credit card is approved, the data bank returns an approval signal permitting the control console to receive from the customer an indication of the fuel or other goods which he desires to obtain. The control console enables the dispensing device for the selected goods, and the customer then actuates the dispensing device himself to obtain the goods. The Wostl device, however, is not capable of handling the sales of goods which cannot be automatically dispensed, and, therefore, does not create a transactional receipt for such goods. Nor is the Wostl device compatible with conventional credit card processing in which credit card indicia is printed onto a receipt in a form recognizable by an optical reading device. The optical reading device is used to scan the transactional receipt in order to retrieve customer information and sales data for appropriately billing the customer. It is therefore an object of this inven tion to automate credit card transactions in a vehicle service station in order to speed up sale transactions and reduce the likelihood of error and fraud by the attendant on duty. The invention is a terminal apparatus which monitors at least one, and preferably, a plurality of, fuel dispensers for selective retrieval of fuel sales information to be automatically combined with miscellaneous sales information in the form of a printed receipt, by a simple command from the attendant. A credit card reader obtains credit card information for performing an analysis of the credit status of the card via a data bank.A keyboard provides a means for the attendant to enter miscellaneous sales information and to command a performance of selected functions. A receipt printer prints a credit cardqreceipt whenever the customer s credit status is positive, sales information has occurred and the attendant has requested the receipt printout. In accordance with a further feature of the invention, the terminal records predetermined information for providing an accounting print out when requested by the terminal operator. A display device may be connected to the terminal for providing visual output to the operator of formulated information, as for example, the customer s credit status. One embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a gaso line service station incorporating the system of the present invention. FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a terminal of the system of FIG. 1. FIG. 3 illustrates a conventional mi crocomputer forming the process and control system of the terminal of FIG. 3. FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating the basic executive control sequence executed by the microcomputer of FIG. 3. FIGS. 5A and 5B are flowcharts illustrating the flow of interrupts executed by the microcomputer of FIG. 3. FIG. 6 is a flowchart of credit card account data and status data acquisition executed by the microcomputer of FIG. 3. FIG. 7 is a flowchart of keyboard data acquisition and response sequence executed by the microcomputer of FIG. 3. FIG. 8 is a top view of a portion of a keyboard embodiment of the terminal of FIG. 2. FIG. 9 is a flowchart of gasoline sales data acquisition executed by the microcomputer of FIG. 3. FIGS. 10 13 are flowcharts of control keyboard commands executed by the microcomputer of FIG. 3. Referring to FIG. 1, a gasoline station 11 is illustrated having a plurality of gasoline dispensing islands, 13, 15, 17. Each island is shown having three separate gasoline dispensers 20a, 20b, 20c, each of which may have one or two fuel outlets, for dispensing separate types of fuels, as for example, regular, high octane, low lead and no lead gasoline. The dispensing islands of the station also may be denominated according to different types of services performed at the islands. For example, at the full service island 13 a station attendant pumps gas, cleans windshields, checks oil and provides other services, while at the self service island 15 the customer does the pumping himself providing his own service. Such.separate service islands may be priced differently for gasoline sales to discount the price of gas where an attendant is not required. Apparatus of the present invention includes an attendant controlled console 19, positioned within gas station 11, and includes an underground cable 21 providing communication between console 19 and each of the nine pumps of FIG. 1. A second cable 23 connects console 19 to a data bank not shown for transmission and receipt of credit and or sales information. Console 19 is shown in more detail inFIG. 2 as including a receipt printer 27, a credit card reader 29, a keyboard 31 and a visual display device 33.Console 19 is controlled by the attendant on duty who may take cash or credit cards for payment of gasoline dispensed from the pumps. Miscellaneous items sold at the gas station, as for example, motor oil, food, automotive components and labor, and the like, can be keyed into console 19 using keyboard 31 to provide proper sale information to ready the console for an automatic printing by printer 27 of both gasoline and miscellaneous item purchases onto a receipt when commended by the attendant. Credit card reader 29 includes a card receiving guide slot 35 adapted to receive the customer s credit card in a sliding fashion, facilitating quick operation by the attendant to check the card s credit status. Reading heads not shown positioned along the insides of the guide slot generate information carried by the card as the card travels quickly therethrough. The card reader 29 retrieves the information from the card for commanding automatic investigation by the console of the credit status of the particular credit card being read. An example of such a card reader 29 is produced by American MagneticsCorporation as Magstripe Reader Model 40. Keyboard 31 includes a ten key numeric keypad 37 for entering of numeric information. As numeric keys are pressed a corresponding numeric representation visually appears on a keyboard display 39 of display device 33, for aiding the attendant to enter correct numerical data into the console. Non gasoline sales data can be entered via numeric keypad 37, as can the user s credit card number in the event that card reader 29 is malfunctioning.Alternately, such non gasoline sales data may be entered via miscellaneous function keys 43. Numeric control instructions can also be entered from the keypad 37 for controlling the functioning of console 19, as described hereinafter. A functional keypad 41 is also provided on the keyboard for instructing console 19 to perform particular operating functions by a simple pressing of the keys of keypad 41. For example, a PRINT function key can be actuated for signalling that a proper means of payment has been received and a receipt should be printed from printer 27. A CASH key can be actuated indicating that the particular type of payment being made by the customer is cash rather than credit card. An ENTER and CLEAR functional key may also be included the ENTER key for entering the information typed from keypad 37 as represented on keyboard display 39, and the CLEAR key for erasing the same typed information in order to retype the numeric values in the event the attendant realizes he has made an error. Other miscellaneous function keys 43 may be provided on keyboard 31 for simple attendant actuation to command console 19 to perform an operating function. For example, an accounting function may be requested for instructing a printing of accounting totals. A dispenser control keypad 4S having a plurality of fuel pump selection buttons 46, each button 46 associated with a separate gasoline pump, is provided for permitting the attendant to selectively control the sale of gasoline from individual dispensing pumps at the separate islands. A pump may function for holding the last sale in its display register and inhibiting dispensement of more gasoline until the pump is reset. The actuation of a selection button 46 causes the console 19 to make ready for printing a receipt for the sale of gasoline from the pump associated with the button 46 selected and the pump is then reset for gasoline dispensement by the next customer. Printer 27 may take the form of a conventional dot matrix printer of the alphanumeric variety and is controllable for providing a number of print function commanded by the attentant. Ordinarily, printer 27 prints individual customer receipts. Where payment is made by way of credit card, printer 27 is operable to print on preformed, preprinted credit invoices having a plurality of sheets for formulating at least a customer copy and a charge copy.The credit invoice is printed to contain the particular credit card number of the customer and the total sale amount.Further printing may include other particulars, as for example, station identification indicia, the date, the quantity of goods or services purchased, the unit price and the type of product. An example of such a printer 27 is a LRC 7040 Series Matrix Printer manufactured by LRC Inc.Riverton, Wyoming. In order to permit an optical character recognition system OCR system to read the particular charge slip for formulating a monthly billing to the customer, the printer prints the customer s credit card number and total charge amount in OCR readable characters at a proper welldefined position on the card receipt. OCR readable characters are specifically signed characters which are capable of being read by a machine, This permits all charge copies to be shipped to a central processing station in order for anOCR system to read all charge copies and automatically perform appropriate billing to individual customers. Printer 27 is also operable for printing out specific accounting information which has been ac accumulated throughout the day, week, month or particular time period as established by the owner of the station. Por example, printer 27 may be commanded to print out credit card summaries of the account numbers and accumulated number of credit dollars which have been utilized by purchases throughout a given time period. This credit summary can in turn be used as credit to purchase bulk fuel from the petroleum company s tank trucks. Also, printer 27 is capable of printing out.accumulated sales totals or gallonage totals for particular days, weeks or 8 hour shifts if so desired. Visual display device 33 includes a plurality of annunciators 47 which are controllable for communicating information to the attendant concerning a particular functioning of the system. For example, after a credit card has been slid through card reader slot 35, an annunciator 47 is actuable upon determination of the credit authorization status of the particular card read, signaling the attendant to either accept or reject the purchase for credit. Another annunciator, for example, may be used to indicate low inventory levels of fuel at the station. Referring to FIG. 3, a conventional microcomputer 49 controls the overall system processing and management of console 19. The microcomputer performs a number of tasks which may be summarized as follows 1 data is retrieved from the dispensing pumps in the form of a measure of the value amount of the gasoline dispensed and is manipulated by microcomputer 49 to enable printing of gasoline sale information by printer 27 2 sales data is received from keyboard 31 and is manipulated to provide output commands to printer 27 for printing of the keyed in sales information control data entered from keyboard 31 instructs the operation of microcomputer 49, as for example, instructing the microcomputer to provide a receipt print out and 3 data is received from card reader 29 of the information read from the customer s credit card and is manipulated to provide output commands along cable 23 for enabling transmission of the credit card information to a data bank for establishing credit authorization. One suitable microcomputer 49 is a Z80.Microcomputer system, Software Development Board SDB 80, manufactured by Mostek Corporation, Carrollton, Texas. Re ference is made to Mostek s MK3880 Central Processing Unit Technical Manual, February, 1977, Mostek s bE3881 ParallelI O Controller Technical Manual, November, 1976 and Mostek sSDB 80 Software Development Board Operations Manual, May, 1977, which are incorporated herein by reference. Specifically, the SDB Operations Manual explains the considerations involved in interfacing peripheral devices to theZ80 microcomputer. As shown in FIG. 3, microcomputer 49 treats printer 27, card reader 29, keyboard 31, display device 33 and the dispensing islands island 17 shown inFIG. 3 as peripheral devices which are interconnected by means of bus cables 67. The microcomputer is also connected to cable 23 for communication with the data bank. Microcomputer 49 is interconnected to the dispensing islands for monitoring the sale of gasoline dispensed from each pump. The final totals for each pump are transmitted to the microcomputer at the completion of fuel dispensing when commanded by the attendant s actuation of the dispenser control keypad 45. The dispensing islands may also receive commands from microcomputer 49 for enabling and disabling selected pumps. The pump sales data may be encoded in a number of ways, preferably, the value amount rather than the gallonage is encoded in the pump data, with the gallonage computable separately by the microcomputer from a known unit price per gallon. As illustrated in the above cited Wostl patent See FIGS. 9 12 , fuel pump controls are located on the outside of the pump for actuation by the customer.After a customer completes dispensing a desired quantity of fuel, a handle located on the side of the pump is rotated by the customer to stop the gasoline tally permitting the pump to be replaced in its holder. The rotation of the pump handle can be utilized to place the pump s final sales data in a ready state for retrieval by the microcomputer when desired. The pump may automatically lock at this time until reset by the microcomputer. Dispenser control keypad 45 of the keyboard 31 is utilized to permit the attendant to instruct the microcomputer to retrieve pump sales data from a selected pump and to thereafter enable the selected pump for use by the next customer. The attendant actuates keypad 45 just prior to actuation of the PRINT key of keypad 41 to provide the appropriate gas sales information of a selected pump required by the printer. This is an important feature of the embodiment, which permits an attendant to quickly select a particular pump sale to be printed by the printer without the attendant having to view the pump or transcribe any pump sale information. To permit a gasoline pre payment mode of terminal operation to be performed, in which a customer may pre purchase a quantity, for example 5.00 of gasoline, the microcomputer may effectively monitor the immediate pump sales total and disable the particular pump upon its reaching the t5.00 dispensed sale. One preferred embodiment of the present invention is structured around microcomputer 49 which is a conventional 8 bit, parallel bus microprocessor having an accumulator, a plurality of registers and an instruction register and CPU Control for interpretation and execution of micro level assembly language instructions. Microcomputer 49 manages the acquisition of dispensing sales data from gasoline pumps and other sales information data entered through keyboard 31, processes the data and prints the sales information in receipt form via printer 27. The system is managed under the control of keyboard 31 permitting the attendant to initiate particular operations to be performed by microcomputer 49. The accumulation of sales data information is conducted in a proqram sequence manner in order to print a final receipt upon request. As the attendant pushes the PRINT button on keyboard 31, microcomputer 49 produces a receipt print out according to information it has accumulated and processed. Until the attendant pushes the PRINT button, the microcomputer continues to accumulate sales data. In order to obtain the data required for print out of both gasoline and other sale information, the microcomputer steps through a basic executive control sequence schematically shown in the flowchart of FIG. 4. The executive sequence embodies a basic set of subroutines used to read entries from keyboard 31, card reader 29 and from the dispensing pumps 20a c. The encircled A in FIG. 4 indicates the initial entry point into the executive control sequence.At step Si, the system is initialized and microcomputer 49 begins to step through successive steps S2 S4 for evaluating the status of 3 different flags. Whenever one of the three flags is set, control is transferred to a specific subroutine for producing a predetermined function. At step S2, a CARD READER flag is checked for passing control via step S5 to a subroutine which reads credit card data being sent from card reader 29. At step S3, a KEYBOARD flag is checked for determining whether keyboard data is available for entry from keyboard 31 control is responsively passed at step S6 to a keyboard subroutine. The status of a PAID flag is checked at step S4, indicating whether the attendant is requesting sales data of a particular pump to be retrieved. When the PAID flag is set control is passed at step S7 to a gas sale retrieval subroutine. Each of the 3 executive control flags are effectively set by the card reader or keyboard requesting an interrupt from microcomputer 49. The interrupt request will be honored by the microcomputer at the completion of the current instruction being executed, by passing control to a peripheral service routine illustrated by FIG. 5A. Referring to FIG. SA, the encircled B indicates the initial entry point into the peripheral service routine. Microcomputer 49 initially determines which of the peripherals is demanding interrupt. The interrupting peripheral is determined at steps S10 S12 for responsively setting one of the 3 executive control flags at stepsS13 S15. After the flag has been set, the interrupting peripheral is notified in a handshake manner and control is returned to the executive control sequence of FIG. 4, steps 516, S17. Whenever a substantially simultaneous interrupt is occurring as for example where both a key from keypad 45 and a key from keypad 41 are depressed the peripheral service routine determines the simultaneous demand for interrupt, step S18, and a reenter annunciator 47 is actuated, step S19, for signaling the operator to re perform his previous actions in a successive manner. FIG. 6 illustrates the flow of the credit card routine which is entered from the executive control sequence whenever the CARD READER flag is set.At step S20 microcomputer 49 retreives the credit card data from card reader 29. The microcomputer performs a check at step S21 and S22 to determine whether the entire card data has been retrieved. If the card information is incomplete, microcomputer 49 initiates a Re Enter annunciator 47 on the display device 33 for signalling the attendant to re enter the credit card through card reader 29. step S23 . Where the entire data from the credit card has been received, control is passed for transmission of the credit card data to the data bank, step S24. After data transmission, the card reader flag is reset, step S25, and return is made at step S26 to the executive control for awaiting data return from the data bank. The data bank is stored with credit card validation data from which the validity of accounts can be determined. By way of example, if the data bank is a centralized data bank serving a plurality of service 11 from a remote location, then the data bank may store each account number together with an indication of whether the account is valid or invalid. The data bank. functions by returning to the microcomputer a credit card validation data word indicative of the credit card validity state. Referring to FIG. 5B, an interrupt request S27 from the data bank will cause microcomputer 49 to jump to a communication sequence beginning at step S28 as shown in FI. 6. Microcomputer 49 reads the data transmitted from.the data bank and determines whether or not credit has been authorized steps S28 S29 . If credit has not been authorized microcomputer 49 actuates a DENY annunciator 47 of the display device 33, step S30. If credit is authorized, an AUTHORIZED annunciator 47 is actuated, step S31. The credit card information is then stored at step S32 and a CARD OK flag is set at step S33 before control is returned to the executive control program via step S34. The CARD OK flags tells the microcomputer whether credit is authorized. If credit is not authorized, the printing of a receipt is automatically inhibited when the attendant presses the PRINT button. The attendant must then use the CASH key to transact the sale. Because the terminal maintains a record of the CASH dollars accumulated by the attendant, attendant fraud is avoided. FIG. 7 illustrates the flow of the keyboard routine entered from the executive control sequence whenever the keyboard flag is set. The keyboard subroutine initially determines which of the several keys of keyboard 31 has been actuated and then where required jumps to an appropriate routine for handling the operation commanded. The functional keys of keypad 41 of FIG.2 are illustrated in FIG. 8 by keys 91 97, and are those keys which are used more often and therefore are given separate key status for direct and simple entry of instruction by the attendant to microcomputer 49. Keypad 43 ofFIG. 3, may also be given separate key status as indicated by the keys 99 105 in FIG. 8. In an added embodiment, the functional commands associated with keys 91 105 may, in the alternative, be entered by coded data using numeric keypad 37 followed by actuation of the ENTER key, as described hereinafter. The keyboard routine of FIG. 7 monitors the direct entry keys of FIG. 8. A print key 91, a cash key 93, an enter key 95 and a clear key 97 are functional keys which when actuated by the attendant cause microcom puter 49 to produce a programmed function. A unit price key 99, a station ID key 101 and a poll ID key 103 are data entry keys which when actuated in conjunction with numeric keypad 37 enter data to microcomputer 49 for providing information to bè printed by printer 27 and or information to be transferred to the data bank. An accounting key 105 is adtuable for commanding microcomputer 49 te print out specific tables of information which have been kept and updated by the microcomputer during system operation. Referring to FIG. 7, steps S35 S42 make a determination as to whether one of the keys of functional keypad 41 has been actuated by the attendant, for responsively jumping to a print, cash, enter or clear subroutine at respective steps S43 S46. Where one of the data entry keys 99 103 has been actuated, control is passed to steps S47 S49 for entry and storage of the data.Actuation of accounting key 105 commands a print out of predetermined totals which have been accumulated by the processor during its operation, after which the accounting totals. are cleared, step S50, S51. After processing of a key actuation by the routine of FIG. 7, the keyboard flag is cleared and control is returned to the executive control sequence, steps S52 S53. The unit price, station I.D. and POLLI.D. data which are entered, are stored at an appropriate location for use by the microcomputer during printing and or on line communication with the data bank. The unit price data may contain two or more different unit prices for ea. grade of gasoline sold for permitting a multi tier price structuring on either a full service self service basis and or a cash credit basis. Where, for example, a gasoline sale is transferred from a self service pump, the stored unit price may be used to calculate the number of gallons dispensed. Also, a discount may be given for cash purchases by using the stored unit price to compute the final sale anount to be sent to the printer. Referring to FIG. 9, a PAID subroutine is entered from the executive control sequence whenever the PAID flag is set responsive to the attendant pressing a selected pump button 46. The PAID subroutine inputs the selected pump data and stores the same for use during receipt printing Step S54 . Receipt of the pump data is acknowledged to the dispensing island in a handshake fashion and a sale flag is set, steps S55 S56. Control is then returned to the executive control routine at step S57. With the sales information of the selected pump stored, the print key may be actuated for printing the receipt. Actuation of the print key transfers the program sequence from the keyboard routine of FIG. 7 to the print routine of FIG. 10. The print routine initially determines whether a sale has occurred for printing by checking the SALE flag the CARD READER flag is also checked for printing a receipt only if a credit card payment is authorized step S58 . Where a print out is to occur, steps S59 S61 are executed for printing the receipt. The microcomputer computes a sale total of miscellaneous sale items with the gasoline sale of the selected pump. All data to be printed is moved to a print table from which proper receipt format is constructed. The receipt is thereafter printed by the microcomputer 49 successively transferring print commands and data information from the print table to the printer 27.The print tables are thereafter cleared at step S62, and a credit card summary of the transaction is stored in memory at step S63. A credit card summary of the printed transaction is stored in a predetermined memory location and includes the account number of the credit card billed, plus the sales amount of gasoline and miscellaneous items purchased. This credit card summary can be retrieved from storage by microcomputer 49 for independent print out to provide a credit voucher to purchase bulk gasoline, as explained above. After the credit card summary has been stored, a test is performed at step S64 for determining whether the summary memory location is full. If the summary memory location is full, all inputs to microcomputer 49 are disabled and a credit card summary annunciator 47 of the visual display device 33 is actuated to indicate to the attendant that a credit card summary print out must be actuated, step S65, S66. If the summary memory location is determined not to be full, the SALE and CARD OK flags are reset, the keyboard flag is reset and return is made to the executive control sequence, steps S67 S69. Actuation of the CASH key on the keyboard transfers the program sequence from the keyboard routine of FIG. 7 to the CASH routine of FIG. 11, where data of the present cash sale is accumulated in order to update accounting tables, step S70. Thereafter, the keyboard flag is reset and control is returned to the executive control sequence via steps S71, S72. Certain accounting information is accumulated during operation of the microcomputer by programming the microcomputer to store predetermined information into memory. For example, gasoline sales totals can be accumulated in dollars and gallons and can be accumulated for the entire station sales, for a specific product, for a type of service, i.e. full or self serve, for a method of payment, i.e., cash or credit, or for storage tank inventory. The storing of such information can be accomplished during receipt print out in the print routine of FIG. 10. Actuation of the ENTER key on the keyboard transfers the program sequence from the keyboard routine of FIG. 7 to an ENTER routine of FIG. 12. Pressing of the ENTER key will enter specific commands to microcomputer 49. These commands may be orderly stored in a buffer memory associated with the keyboard by actuation of the numeric keypad 37. The microcomputer inputs the data stored in the buffer memory of the keyboard, stepS73, deciphering at steps S74 S78 the instructional command dictated by the buffer memory data. If a credit card code including a credit card number has been entered into the keyboard 31, the microcomputer deciphers the code at step S74 and jumps at step S79 to the credit card routine of FIG.6 for proper verification of the credit card number to retrieve credit authorization. If date code instruction has been entered, the microcomputer is instructed to store a new date in the print tables step S75, S80 .At step 576, microcomputer 49 determines whether a parti cular type of miscellaneous sale has been made in which appropriate sale information and required alphanuneric character spelling of the type of sale, is required to be printed onto the receipt. The specific print code in conjunction with its sale information is stored at step S81 and the sale is set for indicating a sale has occured, step S82. Certain accounting information can be accumulated during operation of the microcomputer by programming the microcomputer to store predetermined information. Where an accounting print out request of such totals is deciphered at step S77, microcomputer 49 prints the saved totals at step S83 by transferring the requested information saved to the printer for appropriate print out. The requested total tables are then cleared at step 584. The credit card summary buffer can be printed out independently of other accounting totals saved. The microcomputer senses that a credit card summary print out instruction has been received at step S78, and appropriately prints a summary of the information stored in the credit card buffer at step S85 after which the summary buffer is cleared at step S86. After the specific code instruction from keyboard 31 has been interpreted and performed by microcomputer 49, the keyboard flag is reset and return is made to the executive control sequence at step S87,S88. Actuation of the CLEAR key 97 on the keyboard transfers the program sequence from the keyboard routine of FIG. 7 to a CLEAR routine of FIG. 13. Data is cleared at step S89 from the buffer memory of the keyboard and the keyboard flag is cleared at step S90. Return is then made to the executive control sequence at step S91. It should be understood, of course, that the foregoing disclosure relates to preferred embodiments of the invention and that other modifications or alterations may be made therein without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.
