# Ascorbate resistant composition, test device and method for detecting a component in a liquid test sample.

## Abstract
A composition, device and method for determining the presence of a component in a test sample which contains an interfering substance, such as ascorbic acid, are disclosed. The composition comprises an oxidase or other substance capable of producing peroxide in the presence of the component, a peroxidatively active substance, a chromogen capable of providing a detectable response such as a color change in the presence of peroxide and peroxidatively active substance, and a complex of mercuric ion and one or more ligands wherein a the ligand binds covalently to the ion to form a water soluble complex, and the ligand is not oxidizable by the complexed ion, and b the complex has a stability constant, K
