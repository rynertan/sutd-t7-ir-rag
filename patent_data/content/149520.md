## Description
This invention relates to a modified lipase, which is soluble in organic solvents and can also maintain the enzymic activity even in organic solvents. Generally speaking, utilization of an enzyme is limited to the reaction in an aqueous system, because an enzyme will lose its activity when it comes into contact with organic solvents, or it is insoluble in organic solvents. Accordingly, if a modified enzyme soluble in organic solvents and capable of exhibiting enzymic activity can be obtained by chemical modification of an enzyme, there is the possibility that the enzymatic reaction may be carried out in organic solvents in the manufacturing steps or a water insoluble substance may be used as the substrate, whereby the scope of industrial utilization of enzymes will be markedly enlarged. Lipase is an enzyme which catalyzes irreversible hydrolysis and synthesis of fat. Since most of substrates are insoluble in water, if it is possible to carry out the enzymatic reaction in organic solvents, the scope of utilization of lipase will be enlarged such as decomosition and synthesis of various kinds of esters, modification of fats through interesterification, etc. Chemical Abstracts 97 1982 140 926j Ajinomoto , describes the use of lipases in organic solvents after immobilisation on a cross linked resin. The present inventors have attempted to modify chemically lipase, in order to solve these problems, and obtained a modified lipase which is soluble in organic solvents and has retained its enzymic activity to accomplish the present invention. The present invention provides a modified lipase, comprising lipase molecules partially substituted with an active derivative of a polyalkylene glycol having a hydrophobic group at a terminal end, said lipase being soluble in organic solvents. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show syntheses of esters with the modified lipase of the present invention. As the lipase, there may be employed those existing in pancreatic juice or gastric juice of animals and those produced by fungi, yeasts and bacteria. Also, esterases which catalyze generally decomposition and synthesis of esters are included. The modified lipase of the present invention, which is modified with a straight chain comprising a substituted polyalkylene glycol having both properties of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity, is soluble in both water and organic solvents, and the higher structure specific in lipase is also protected by these straight chains, whereby deactivation through contact with organic solvents is prevented. The polyalkylene glycol may include polyethylene glycols and polypropylene glycols, preferably polyethylene glycols having molecular weights of 5000 or higher. As the hydrophobic groups, there may be employed alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, hexyl, octyl, nonyl and the like and phenyl groups such as phenyl, alkyl substituted phenyl, phenyl substituted phenyl, styryl substituted phenyl, and the like, preferably methyl. These hydrophobic groups are ether bonded to one of the terminal hydroxyl groups of the polyalkylene glycol. For having the other terminal end of the polyalkylene glycol bonded to the lipase molecule, the polyalkylene glycol may be led to an active derivative according to the known methods for immobilization of enzymes on carriers, such as the alkylation method, the acid azide method, the diazo method, the condensation method, etc., which is then allowed to react with the free amino groups or carboxyl groups in lipase to effect bonding. As the alkylation method, there may be mentioned the method in which the polyalkylene glycol is activated by being led to a triazine derivative or an acetyl derivative. In the following description, P OH shows the polyalkylene glycol having a hydrophobic group at the terminal end, E shows a lipase molecule, and the amino group or carboxyl group bonded to E shows a free group in the lipase molecule. According to the acid aside method, P OH is allowed to react with chloroacetic anhydride, then with diazomethane to obtain P acetic acid methyl ether, which is treated with hydrazine to obtain a corresponding hydrazide, followed by treatment with sodium nitrite to obtain an acid aside derivative. The active derivaive is reacted with lipase to be bonded to free amino groups in lipase. According to the diazo method, for example, P OH is allowed to react with isatoic acid anhydride to obtain an anthranilic acid ester, which is then treated with sodium nitride to be converted to a diazonium derivative, followed by diazo coupling with lipase. The terminal hydroxyl group of P OH can be converted to amino group. According to this method, for example, P OH is allowed to react with tosyl chloride to form P OH tosylate, which is then reacted with a phthalimide salt to obtain a N P substituted phthalimide, followed by treatment with hydrazine to obtain ω amino P OH. The amino derivative can be directly bonded to carboxyl group in lipase with a carbodiimide reagent or Woodward reagent K. Alternatively, P OH tosylate or P OH ω bromide obtained by the reaction with a halogenating agent may be converted to P OH ω azide with sodium aside, followed by hydrogen reduction to obtain ω amino P OH. Other than the methods as described above, the carboxylic acid derivative of P OH can be allowed to react with a broacetic acid ester in the presence of potassium t butoxide, followed by hydrolysis, to obtain P carboxymethyl ether. The carboxylic acid derivative is reacted with N hydroxysuccinic acid by utilizing a carbodiimide reagent to obtain the corresponding succinimide ester, which is then reacted with amino groups in lipase. Of the above modified lipases, the modified lipases in which the amino groups of lipase are partially substituted with the groups of the formula wherein R represents a polyalkylene glycol group having a hydrophobic group at the terminal end, are particularly preferred for the object of the present invention. More preferable lipases are modified lipases as mentioned above, in which there is substituted 2,4 bis methoxypolyoxyethylene 6 triazine of which polyoxyethylene moiety has a molecular weight of 5000 or more. The modified lipase prepared as described above can be purified according to conventional procedures, lyophilized and stored. The percentage of the polyalkylene glycol added in the modified lipase can be measured by determining the unaltered amino groups with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, and those containing polyalkylene glycol added to about 50 to 70 of amino groups in lipase molecules are most preferred. The modified lipase of the present invention can effect various reactions such as decomposition and synthesis of esters, interesterification and aminolysis in organic solvents. Reactions such as decomposition or synthesis of esters with the modified lipase may be conducted in organic solvents capable of dissolving the modified lipase, the substrate and the product. Such solvents may preferably be, for example, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylene and chlorinated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, 1,1,1 trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene and the like. These solvents should preferably contain a small amount of water also in ester synthesis. During synthesis of an ester, the substrate carboxylic acid may include various kinds of carboxylic acids, for example, C₂ to C₂₄ saturated or unsaturated fatty acids such as butyric acid, lauric acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, prostaglandins. Alcohols may include C₁ ₂₄ primary or secondary fatty alcohols, such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, octyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, glycerine C₇ C₉ aromatic fatty alcohols such as benzyl alcohol sterols such as sitosterol, cholesterol and ergosterol. In general, among fatty alcohols, more hydrophobic alcohols with larger number of carbon atoms are more preferable. When ethyl alcohol is used, the highest activity can be obtained by making the final concentration of ethyl alcohol in an organic solvent 5 . On the other hand, as the starting material ester, it is preferred to employ an ester of the above fatty acid with an alcohol or a triglyceride. In particular, modification of a fat can be effected by carrying out acidolysis which interchanges a part of the fatty acids in a triglyceride with fatty acid groups. It is also possible to effect alcoholysis in which the alcohol moiety of an ester is interchanged with other alcohols. In the ester synthesis reaction, water is formed with increase of the product and stopped when the reaction reaches equilibrium, and therefore it is preferred to complete the reaction while removing water from the reaction system in a conventional manner. The present invention is illustrated by referring to the following Examples. In 100 ml of anhydrous benzene containing 10 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate was dissolved 20 g of monomethoxy polyethylene glycol molecular weight of PEG moiety 5000 , and the reaction was carried out under reflux at 80 To 2 ml of 0.4 M borate buffer pH 10.0 containing 10 mg of lipoprotein lipase obtained from In 400 µl of benzene saturated with water containing about 30 mM water , stearic acid and lauryl alcohol at various concentrations as shown in the Figure were dissolved, and to each of these solutions was added 100 µl of the solution of the modified lipase 1.5 mg ml obtained in the above 2 in benzene saturated with water.

From these Figures, the modified lipase exhibited the maximum ester synthesis activity of 4.5 µmole min. mg protein.

It can be seen that the modified lipase can exhibit high activity in organic solvents, particularly trichloroethane and benzene. The modified lipase was also found to be stable in benzene and retained 40 of the ester synthesis enzymic activity after 150 days. Further, by addition of n hexane or petroleum ether to the modified lipase solution, it can be recovered in 100 recovery as the precipitate from the organic solvent without deactivation of the enzymic activity.
