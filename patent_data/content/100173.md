# Monitor for signal quality in a protective relay system.

## Abstract
A monitor for signal quality in and a protective relay system which utilizes both AC AGC and DC GCV signals from the receiver agc stage 42 to monitor a plurality of dif ferent signal parameters. A signal VX responsive to the noise in the communication channel 40 which transmits at least one of the protective relay signals VR used in a pro tective relay comparison function 36 , is also used in the trip circuits 132 of the associated circuit interrupter 16 to continuously adapt or modify the trip level in response to channel noise.
