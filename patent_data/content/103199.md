## Description
HUMIDITY RESISTANT COATINGS EMPLOYING BRANCHED POLYMERS OF t BUTYL ACRYLATE BACKGROUND THE INVENTION Many coatings are used on surfaces which are employed in an outdoor environment. Such coatings are exposed to sunlight, moisture and the like under a variety of temperature conditions and must, therefore, be able to withstand such changes in climate. Among the preferred weatherable coatings are those based on acrylic polymers.However, after long exposures of time, even these coatings will suffer deterioration at a pace which is dependent upon the geographical area involved. As a result, several additives have been incorporated into coating formulations to slow down the degradative process by protecting against hydrolytic attack. However, incorporation of such additives increases the cost of producing weatherable coatings. Thus, it would be desirable to produce a highly weatherable coating which did not require the presence of such expensive additives. In addition, many of the weatherable coatings heretofore employed utilized relatively large amounts of volatile organic solvents. With the rising price of energy, as well as the increased appreciation of the deleterious effects of organic solvents on the environment, it would be desirable to produce a weatherable coating which employs only a minimal amount of volatile organic solvent. Among the compositions which have been developed in response to such need for highly weatherble coatings are those disclosed in BritishPatent Nos. 1,556,456, and 1,556,464 which contain copolymers consisting of 50 75 weight percent t butyl acrylate 5 30 weight percent styrene, vinyltoluene or methyl methacrylate and 4 20 weight precent of acrylonitrile. However, these copolymers, which are cured by cross linking with an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid, possess high glass transition temperatures as they have a Durran softening point of 90 120 C. Thus, as is apparent to one skilled in the art, these coatings must be applied as either 1 powders or 2 low solids solutions as high solids coatings containing such polymers would be too highly viscous to be utile.Therefore coatings employing these polymers are comparatively uneconomical as the use of powders would necessitate the formation of relatively thick coatings of at least about 1. Cunl whereas a low solids solution would require the use of relatively large amounts of solvent. It has now been surprisingly found that coating compositions which contain low molecular weight copolymers comprised of polyfunctional acrylates and t butyl acrylate possess unexpectedly superior humidity resistance vis a vis coating compositions which do not contain copolymers possessing both of these monomers. Moreover, because of the low molecular weight of the copolymers of this invention, these coating compositions may be formulated in a high solids solution form. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to copolymers and coating compositions contains such copolymers which possess enhanced humidity resistance and thus exhibit desirable weathering properties. These coating compositions are made up of copoly mers comprised of a from about 10 to about 95 weight percent, preferably from 25 to about 75 weight percent, most preferably from about 30 to e4oirt 60 weight percent, of t butyl acrylate units b from about 0.1 to iKeet 3 weight percent, preferably from to 2 weight units of percent, of polyfunctional acrylates c from 1 to about 30 weight percent, preferably from about 5 to about 20 weight units of percent of functional comonomers containing at least one active crosslinking site, and d from 0 to wi444 80 weight percent, preferably from 5 to nb o u t 60 weight percent, of other ethylenically unsaturated monomers which werecapable of polymerizing with t butyl acrylate and polyfunctional acrylates.

The preferred polyfunctional acrylate is trimethylol propane triacrylate. The term active crosslinking site refers to a location on the comonomer which is capable of reacting with the crosslinker selected such that a crosslink is produced. Among the preferred active site containing comonomers which may be employed are those which, when reacted with t butyl acrylate and a polyfunctional acrylate will produce a copolymer possessing active carboxyl, hydroxyl, or amide groups, or mixtures thereof.

Thus, for copolymers containing active hydroxyl groups crosslinkers including polyepoxides such as cycloaliphatic epoxides and diglycidyl epoxides , polyfunctional isocyanates, etherated amino formaldehyde resins, etc. and mixtures thereof may be employed.

For copolymers which contain mixtures of active hydroxyl, carboxyl and or amide groups, mixtures of suitable crosslinkers may be utilized. Preferred crosslinkers include polyepoxides and etherated amino formaldehyde resins, as these crosslinkers are reactive with active hydroxyl, carboxyl and amide groups. Illustrative of the polyfunctional isocyanates which may be employed for copolymers containing active hydroxyl and or amide sites are 3,5,5 trimethyl l isocyanato 3 isocyanatomethylcyclohexane, di 2 isocyanatoethyl bicyclo 2.2.1 hept 5 ene 2,3 dicarboxylate, 2,4 tolylene diisocyanate, 2,6 tolylene diisocyanate, 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate, dianisidine diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, the m and p xylylene diisocyanates, tetramethylene diisocyanate, dicyclohexyl 4,4 methane diisocyanate, cyclohexane 1,4 diisocyanate, l,5 naphtbylene diisocyanate, 4,4 diisocyanate diphenyl ether, 2,4,6 triisocyanate toluene, 4,4 ,4 triisocyanate triphenyl methane, diphenylene 4,4 diisocyanate, the polymethylene polyphenylisocyanates and the like.

In general, the amount of crosslinker which should be employed will be dependent on the equivalent weight of the crosslinker used, the inherent flexibility of the crosslinker used, the reactivity of the crosslinker with itself, and the degree of hardness softness or flexibility desired in the final coating. These amounts will vary with particular functional monomer and crosslinker combination selected and will be known to one skilled in the art. The catalyst employed in the cross linking reaction, if indeed a catalyst is required for the given active site crosslinker combination, will vary in accordance with the particular active site crosslinker combination selected. The amounts and types of catalysts necessary will be well known to one skilled in the art. Thus, for example, with aminoplast crosslinkers catalysts such as p toluene sulfuric acid, naphthalene sulfonic acid, phosphoric acid, dinonyl naphthalene disulfonic acid, or the stannous salt of trifluoromethane sulfuric can be used. With cycloaliphatic epoxides catalysts such as stannous octanoate, dibutyltin dilaurate, triflic acid, the reaction product of triflic acid and stannous oxide, diethyl ammonium triflate, etc. can be used. The compositions of the instant invention may be used on surfaces for which acrylate base coatings are suitable. They are epecially suited for outdoor use vas such use will best take adavntage of their enhanced humidity resistance.
