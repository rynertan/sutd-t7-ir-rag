## Description
SPECIFICATION TITLE OF THE INVENTION AUTOMATIC SELECTOR FOR FILE CASES FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY The present invention relates to an apparatus for automatically selecting only designated file cases among a number of thin file cases which are randomly held in a single or a number of racks, said file cases containing materials such as clinical charts, X ray film for each patient in a hospital or various papers, drawings, films, cards etc. which are classified for each case, goods, client, area, time etc. in public offices and private offices. BACKGROUND OF THE TECHNOLOGY System A Designated file cases are exposed in a slanted state toward the front facing an operator, the same reference is applied to words rear and left and right . This system is a combination of the structures described in Japanese Examined Patent PublicationsNos. 36036 1974, 27400 1975, 8516 1978 and 6878 1978 andJapanese Examined Utility Model Publication No. 15358 1978 etc. System B A model obtained by improving the system A JapaneseUnexamined Patent Publication No. 113799 1976 in which the designated cases are ejected horizontally toward the front. The publications described above are all invented by the inventors of the present patent application . System C The designated file cases are drawn using an electromagnet or a permanent magnet. No publication has officially been found even though the technique is used somewhere in Japan. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION System A has the advantages of a simple structure and reliable operation since gravity is effectively utilized, while having disadvantages in that it is not easy to draw the exposed portion of designated file cases in slanted position with fingers since the exposed portion is very limited and the projection formed in the lower side of the file cases enters into a recess which is produced by the lowering of code bars and in that it is impossible to carry out the next designated file case selecting operation before the exposed designated cases are removed.System B, which is designed to overcome the disadvantages of the system A, also has disadvantages in that device for accelerating the descending of the designated file cases is retained a large amount of energy is temporarily required a sudden increasing of the rotational torque of a motor since both the front and rear end portions of all file cases in a rack must be simultaneously lifted up in a series of operations and a part of the code bars having insufficient strength must support a whole weight of all file cases in the rack for a long time when the selector apparatus is not in use before the initiation of the selecting operation thereby causing an unstable holding condition for the file cases in the rack so that there is a risk of faulty operation.This system has the further disadvantage of the drawing other cases adjacent to the designated cases when they are drawn out. System C is poor practical utility, since the atractive force of the magnet is too small to ensure the exposure of the designated cases. Accordingly, this technique is not compared with the present invention. In order to overcome the disadvantages of the conventional techniques described above, the following features are employed in the invention of the present application referred to as the present invention below 1. A spirally rotating means referred to as a spiral rotor below is used as a descending acceleration means for the designated cases to accurately separate the designated file cases from other file cases. 2. Energy required for lifting up all file cases rotational torque of a motor is reduced to about a half by raising the front and the rear lift bars reference numerals 10 and 8 separately sequentially . 3. A specially provided bar referred to as a special bar, the reference numeral 12 is utilized so that it normally supports the rear end portion of all file cases in the rack before the operation of each member in the selector begins keeps all the cases held in the rack in a stable condition in association with a front lift bar 10 supporting the front end portion of all the file cases and sufficiently descends after the initiation of effective function of a spiral rotor 1 so as not to prevent the functioning of each members in the selector and ascends until said members complete the series of operations to return to the original positions so as to support the rear end portion of all the file cases again. 4. In order to provide the above described features, the rotational angle of a driving shaft 13 is determined corresponding to the movement of each said important member, the shapes of various cams, rollers, gears etc. fixed to the driving shaft and the arrangement of these elements are improved and adjusted to reduce any sudden change of load on the motor. 5. A separation angle bar 9 is so designed as to assure the separation of designated cases from other cases and to limit the forward movement of all the file cases except the designated cases when they are ejected. With these features, the automatic selector of the present invention overcomes the disadvantages of the conventional techniques and performs the best function.

PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION In the description concerning to the preferred embodiment, the concept of the function of the present invention will be described with reference to Figure 1. The code number for the designated file case is converted to an electrical signal by operating a push button 6a of a controller 6 or inserting a read out card 7 into the controller so that the electrical signal is fed to an electrical system located at the corner inside the portion 4b of a selector. Various means inside the selector are operated by the electrical system whereby the designated file cases 2 are sequentially or simultaneously for example, three file cases in Figure 1 drawn out from other aligned file cases 2 and onto a front supporter 5 . Thus, the designated file cases will be easily taken out. The electrical system comprises a series of solenoids which lower code bars 3 having the code numbers for the designated file cases and a motor for rotating a driving shaft 13 360 , as main components. A detailed description of the electrical system is omitted. Figure 2 shows an arrangement of important elements held in the selector wherein the reference numeral 1 designates a spiral rotor and 3 designates aligned code bars. A front supporter 5 , not shown, covers the spiral rotor 1 . The reference numeral 8 designates a rear lift bar, 9 designates a separation angle bar, 10 designates a front lift bar, 11 designates a push off angle bar, 12 designates a special bar a specially provided bar , 13 designates a driving shaft5 13b designates an auxiliary driving shaft and 14 designate partition plates which are positioned with their lower ends adjacent to the upper surfaces of the aligned code bars and are vertically held to form a rack devided into several small spaces having an appropriate width. As shown in Figure 4, the driving shaft 13 comprises a gear wheel 13 for transmitting a rotating force to a spiral rotor shaft 1 and the auxiliary driving shaft 13b , an elongated roller 13 for lifting the lowered code bars 3 and cams without reference numeral having various shapes which operate said members 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 so as to suitably operate important members during the rotation of 360 . Figure 3 shows the structure of the spiral rotor 1 which performs the most important function of the apparatus of the present invention. The spiral rotor 1 comprises the shaft 11 effecting rotation by the same angle as that of the driving shaft 13 imparting the rotating force and a slightly spiral blade 1 fixed to the driving shaft so that the front edges of all file cases held in the rack 2 , 2 are sequentially lifted up by the edge of the blade 1 rotating in the arrow direction. Only one blade 1 is attached to them shaft 1 inFigures 2 and 3. However, two or three blades 1 may be attached to the shaft to operate them simultaneously. This reason is as follows. The operation and effect of the spiral rotor is greatly affected by the twist angle of the blade.In accordance with the result of experiments, it is desirable to provide an angle of 90 for a blade having a length of 500 mm in a normal condition a file case including up to about 30 sheets of ordinary papers of A4 size . Accordingly, when the width of the rack is larger or greatly larger than 500 mm, it is desirable to provide blades having a twist angle as mentioned before at two or three positions on the shaft 1 . The width of the blade the radius of rotation of the blade edge portion is normally so determined as to lift up the front ends of the file cases 2 , 2 about 15 mm. The entire function of the apparatus of the present invention will be described with reference to Figures 5 to 7 wherein the symbols such as a, b, c for important elements designate the position in the steps of aHbHc ,e for the important elements. Figure 5 shows the position of the important elements in the selector of the present invention before the selecting operation starts i. e. in the time of no use of the selector . All the code bars 3 are in the highest position 3a . The upper surface of the front lift bar 10 is in a position slightly higher such as 2 3 mm than that of the highest position 3a for the code bars so as to hold the front edges of all the file cases 2a , 2 a and the special bar 12a is in the highest position the upper surface of the bar 12a is in a position 2 3 mm higher than the highest position 3a of the code bars so as to hold the rear end portion of the file cases.The front supporter 5a is in the highest position to limit the forward move ment of all the file cases which are prevented from moving backwards by a stopper 15 fixed at the rear portion of the rack structure. Thus, all the file cases are maintained in a stable condition. The rear lift bar 8a together with the separation angle bar 9a and the push off angle bar lea which are pivotally held by the rear lift bar are in the lowest position and the separation angle bar 9a is slightly turned outwards, while the longer side of the push off angle bar lea is held upright so as not to prevent the designated file cases 2a from descending. The blade of the spiral rotor la is ready for lifting up the front end portion of the file cases 2 , 2 . When the controller 6 is operated to output the code number signal for the designated file cases see Figure 6 , the code bars corresponding to the code number descend to the position 3b and then the driving shaft 13 is actuated to turn by about 50 whereby the front lift bar descends to the position lOb and the special bar descends to the position 12b the lowest position so as not to prevent the designated file cases 2 from descending.The blade of the spiral rotor lifts up all the file cases from the position lb to the position 2b , 2 b as shown by the dotted line and the driving shaft 13 the spiral rotor 1 is rotated to release the file cases in the position 2b , 2 b by the blade 1 so that the designated file cases descend to the position 2c and the other file cases are held in the position 2 c thus the position 2c is vertically spaced from the position 2 c so as to produce a space between the rear and lower projections of the file cases located at the positions 2c and 2 c .The function of the spiral rotor when the file cases are moved from the position 2b , 2 b to the position 2c , 2 c will be described.In the position 2b , 2 b in which only the front end portion of the file cases 2 , 2 are lifted up, the gravity center of the file cases 2 , 2 is also raised from Ga to Gb. In this state, when the blade of the spiral rotor is disengaged from the file cases to release them from the position 2b , 2 b , gravity acts on Gb, causing the falling of the entire file cases with the rear end in the position 2b , 2 b .However, file cases other than the designated file cases are stopped in the position 2c by the supporting of the projections in the lower side of the file cases by the upper surface of the code bars 3b in the raised position, whereas the designated file cases continue to fall down by overcoming the friction with the adjacent file cases stopped in the position 2 c due to the inertia of falling since the code bars corresponding to the projection of the lower side of the designated file cases are already descended and are finally stopped in the position 2c because the projections of the lower side are supported by the upper surface of the descended code bars. When the file cases are not tightly packed in the rack resulting in only a slight friction between the designated file cases and the adjacent file cases, the designated file cases sometimes fall to the position 2c without the functioning of the spiral rotor. In this state, the same result can be obtained by actuating the spiral blade. As the driving shaft 13 continues the rotation, the separation angle bar 9 enters into the space between the positions 2c and 2 c and this state is maintained Figure 6 . In Figure 7, following the entrance movement of the separation angle bar 9 , the front lift bar starts to ascend and reaches the highest position 10c . Next, the rear lift bar 8 also starts to ascend and approaches the highest position 8e . At this moment, the push off angle bar 11 rotates in the arrow direction because of the pulling force of a spring not shown to take the position lle . When the push off angle bar is moved to such a position, the upper side of the bar strongly pushes the rear lower cut portions of the designated file cases 2d to eject them to the position 2e .In this case, the spiral blade 1 faces completely downwards to lower the front supporter in the lowest position 5e so as not to prevent the file cases from being ejected from the position 2e . The other, non designated, file cases are held in the position 2 e and the rear lower projection of the cases are supported by the upper side of the angle bar 9 while the cut portions in the lower surface of the projections of the file cases in the position 2 e are engaged with the stepped portions formed in the upper surface edge of the angle bar. Accordingly, when the designated file cases are ejected to the position 2e , the adjacent cases located in the position 2 d are not drawn out from the position 2 e by the friction. The various elements are returned to the original position as shown in Figure 5 until the driving shaft 13 stops after it finishes the rotation of 360 so as to safely perform the next selecting operation for designated file cases. In the operation of each important element, when certain file cases are held in the rack with an inclination greater than a degree such as about 15 , an operational trouble may occur. In order to prevent such a trouble and to satisfy the requirement of partitioning spaces for receiving the file cases etc. partition plates 14 are used to provide small spaces as shown in Figure 2. It is necessary to attach a metallic plate to the bottom and the inside of the front side portion of the file cases so as to slightly increase the weight of the file cases and so as to shift the gravity center toward the front end of the file cases so that the functioning of the spiral rotor is assured, as well as to increase the strength and durability of the file cases Japanese Examined Utility ModelPublication No. 15358 1978 . INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY The apparatus of the present invention is greatly effective for transacting business in public offices and private offices, especially, the handling of clinical charts and X ray films in the medical field.
