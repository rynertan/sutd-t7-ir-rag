# Large N x N Butler matrix.

## Abstract
Large N N Butler matrix 59 comprising a first plurality of smaller, essentially flat M M Butler ma trices 61 68 arranged in a first stack 120 a second plurality of smaller, essentially flat M M Butler ma trices 71d arranged in a second stack 122 in which the planes 71 78 of the Butler matrices 71 78 in the second stack 122 are orthogonal to the planes 86d of the Butler matrices 61 68 in the first stack 120 and a plurality of phase shifters or line stretchers 81 88 for electrically connecting the output ports 142 of the first stack 120 to the corresponding colinear input ports 143 of the second stack 122 .
