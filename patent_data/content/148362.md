# Method of obtaining pseudofiltering effect in process of accumulation and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry utilizing same.

## Abstract
In a Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer, a signal which is produced repeatedly from a time origin is sampled at regular intervals of time to convert the signal into digital form, the time origin being given repeatedly. Then, the digitized data is accumulated. According to the present invention, delay periods beginning with each time origin and ending with the beginning of each sampling are made different from one another to obtain a pseudofiltering effect simply by using a relatively simple structure of apparatus and performing arithmetic operations on data.
