# PROCESS FOR DETECTING PROTEINS SPECIFIC TO HYPERTENSION IN MAMMALS

## Abstract
A process for diagnosing the presence of hypertension or a predisposition to hypertension in a mammal comprises detecting the presence in a body fluid of the mammal of at least one protein associated with hypertension wherein the protein has a relative molecular weight of about 10,000 dal tons to about 17,000 daltons. In humans, the process detects the presence of or predisposition to essential hypertension as distinguished from secondary hypertension. A preferred analytical method is discontinuous sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
