# AN ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR ASSEMBLY INCLUDING MEANS FOR GROUNDING AND TERMINATING A COAXIAL CABLE

## Abstract
In an electrical connector assembly, an electrically conductive ferrule 40 terminated to a free end of a coaxial cable and having external thread 54 and an end face 46 and an electrically conductive connector shell 12 having internal thread 18 and an end wall 16 , the thread interengaging to draw the ferrule 40 into the shell 12 so that the end wall 16 is in metal to metal abutment with the end face 46 . Abutment between the end wall and end face and engagement between the theads provides the assembly with two ground paths, whereby the terminated end of the coaxial cable is shielded from RFI. Thread 58 on the ferrule 40 , also of the same sense as the other thread, engages the braid 36 .
