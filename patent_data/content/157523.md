# FIELD SEQUENTIAL LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY WITH ENHANCED BRIGHTNESS

## Abstract
An enchanced luminance field sequential color image dis play system having an image source for providing a sequence of monochrome images. The monochromatic light images are formed of first, second and third different spectral colors. A liq uid crystal switching system having crossed color selective polarizers is used to transmit the second and third colors with a first direction of polarization and to transmit the first and third colors with an orthogonal direction of polarization. A liquid crystal retarder is used to rotate the direction of polarization of light incident from the crossed polarizers by ninety degrees when the retarder is in its OFF state and to transmit the light substantially unchanged when the retarder is in its ON state. The light is then coupled to an analyzing system which in one embodiment is a neutral polarizer that transmits either the sec ond and third colors or the first and third colors, depending on the state of the liquid crystal retarder. In a second embodiment, the analyzing system is one or more color selective pleochroic polarizers that transmits both polarizations of the third color, while transmitting only one polarization of the first color or one polarization of the second color depending on the state of the retarder. By transmitting two of the three spectral colors in each of both directions of polarization through the retarder, a significant increase in display luminance is obtained.
