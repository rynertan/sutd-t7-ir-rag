# ENERGY RECOVERY SYSTEM FOR MANIPULATOR APPARATUS

## Abstract
An energy recovery system 100 for manipulator appar atus is provided that supplies energy to drive the manipula tor apparatus from a pressurized source at 12 and that recovers energy from the manipulator apparatus during the deceleration phase of the manipulator arm in one or more of the controlled axes. The energy recovery system 100 includes a variable displacement pump motor 10, 26 that is driven by a motor generator unit 34 . The hydraulic pump motor unit includes a pressure responsive control arrange ment 40 for selectively controlling the hydraulic pump motor between a motor mode and a pump mode. The pump motor in the pump mode is driven by the motor generator unit to supply a source of pressurized fluid to the servo valves that control movement of the manipulator arms through hydraulic actuators. When the manipulator arm is decelerating, the servo valves for the axes are closed and the decelerating hydraulic actuators provide a source of pressu rized fluid at a pressure above the normal pressurized supply from the pump. The pressure responsive control arrange ment of the pump motor senses the high pressure condition and switches the pump motor to the hydraulic motor mode. In the hydraulic motor mode, the pump motor in response to a source of pressurized fluid from the hydraulic actuators operates the motor generator in the generator mode to supply electrical energy. The motor generator unit in one arrangement includes a high mass flywheel to supply energy storage for the manipulator apparatus.
