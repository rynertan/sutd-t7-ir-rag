# Evacuation system for particulate waste material.

## Abstract
Waste material is sucked away from different suction points 1 8 and is transported in branch conduits 12 to the common collecting point comprising a container 9 . The dimensions of the branch conduits 12 and the collecting container 9 are thus chosen that the air velocity in the conduits 12 is sufficient, but in the container 9 insufficient to carry the waste material in the air stream. This will cause the waste material to be extracted in the container 9 and collected in the bottom thereof. The air stream is then passed through a filter 10 before it is returned to the interior space of the building. In the upper portion of the collecting container there are separate openings 11 for the branch conduits 12 connected to the container 9 . The lower portion of the container is formed with a funnel shaped bottom for convenient collection of the waste material. The air flow through the openings 11 in the container 9 or in the branch conduits 12 are controllable by means of individually operated valves 20 .

## Description
Evacuation system for particulate waste material This invention relates to an evacuation system for transporting particulate waste material from a plurality of suction points to a central collecting point. It is particularly but not enttlusively applicable to the removal of the dust produced by machines such as woodworking machines in a factory. Previously known systems for transporting waste material such as sanding dust or sawdust, have comprised branch conduits leading from the various machines which produce the dust to a common duct or manifold. These systems have incorporated a suction blower to produce an air flow from the machines through the branch conduits and the manifold to a central collecting point and have relied on this air flow to transport the dust over the full distance from the machines to the collecting point. This prevents the waste material from being spread openly in the air and results in substantial iprove ments in the working environment. There are, however, several drawbacks with previously known systems of the kind indicated above. Since the waste material is conveyed all the way from the suction points to the central collecting point first through relatixe ly thin branch conduits and then through a comparatively coarse manifold the magnitude of the air velocities within all parts of the system must be thus adapted that the air is capable of carrying the waste material even through the coarse manifold.Thus, in a system which relies on the air flow in the manifold to carry the waste material, any substantial alteration in the number of points from which waste material is to be removed requires virtually a rebuilding of the system, because the changed air flow in the manifold will require a different cross sectional area if the correct flow velocity is to be maintained. The plant must consequently from the beginning be adapted and dimensioned to the maximum number of machines which are to be connected to the system and which can be simultaneously operated. This means that previously known systems do not permit any flexibility but can only be utilized for a certain number of machines located at certain points which have been calculated from the beginning. A further drawback in previous systems is that in order to save energy the purified and filtered transport air is freely exhausted in the interior space of the building, since it should be too expensive to permit the warn and evacuated air to be exhausted in the open air outside the building. Even if only a small percentage of the waste material remains in the air which is returned to the interior space of the building, the concentration of waste material in the atmosphere in the building will gradually increase, making working conditions unsatisfactory. A further drawback is of course that both the fan capacity and the filter capacity will have to be adapted to the most unfavourable operating conditions to provide safe transportation of waste material from suction points within all parts of the plant to the central collecting point. This means that both the transport fans and the filters have to be heavily overdimensioned, which in turn will cause a comparatively large energy consumption. It is previously suggested to transport the waste material from different suction points to a common manifold in which the material is extracted and removed by means of a conveyer to a central collecting point.The conveyer can either be a mechanical conveyer, a blow or even a transport fluid. This conveying system will eliminate a number of drawbacks in previously known systems, which have been indicated above, but in certain cases, for example in small industries, a system in accordance with this known arrangement is unnecessary, big and expensive The object of the present invention is to provide a structure which is considerably less complicated than previously known systems and which is specifically suitable to use in small industries, where the distances from the working machines and to the central collecting point are relatively small. This object is realized substantially by the fact that the dimensions of the branch conduit and the collecting container are thus chosen that the velocity of the air flow in each branch conduit is sufficiently high to carry the particulate waste material, while the velocity of the air flow in the container is insufficient to carry the waste material which is then extracted in the said container and collected in the bottom thereof, and that the air flow from each of the suction points to the central collecting point is controllable by means of individually operated valves located either in the branch conduits or in the collecting container. One embodiment of the invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic planview of a workshop in which the different machines are connected to an evacuation system according to the invention, Fig. 2 is a sideview of a container forming part of the system according to Fig. 1, Fig. 3 is a sectional view through the container shown in Figs. 1 and 2, and Fig. 4 is a principal block diagram of a system according to the invention. The factory shown in Fig. 1 compri ses a number of different woodworking machines, e.g. a saw bench 1, an upright drill 2, a dowel machine 3, a combination machine 4, a band saw 5, a planing machine 6, a cutter 7 and a belt buffing machine 8, from which the waste material is sucked away in branch conduits to the central collecting point which comprises a container 9. From the container the transport air is further brought to flow through an air filter 10. The transport air in the system is generated in a conventional manner by means of one or several blowers not shown . As appears in Fig. 2 the upper portion of the container 9 is provided with several openings 11 for the branch conduits 12 which are connected to the container whereas the lower portion is provided with a funnel shaped bottom 13 to collect the waste material which is conveyed through an emptying duct 14 to a depositing container 15 which preferably should be transportable.The dimensions of the collecting container 9 relative to the branch conduits are thus chosen that the air velocity in the container 9 is insufficient to carry the waste material through an exhaust air channel 16 which is arranged in the upper part of the container 9 and which is connected to a filter chamber 10. The lower portion of the filter chamber is in a conventional way formed with a funnelshaped bottom 16 with a duct 17 for emptying the waste material into a container 18. The filter chamber is connected to suction blowers via a channel 19, said blowers generating the necessary under pressure in the system for producing the air flow which carries the waste material. The filter in the filter chamber 10 can be of any conventional kind, for example in the form of a cyclone or a hose filter. Even combinations of these two kinds can be utilized. In Fig. 3 the collecting container 9 is schematically shown in a side cross sectional view and it is shown how the valves 20 can be arranged to close the openings 11 for the branch conduits 12. In the embodiment shown in this Figure the valves 20 are operated by means of pressure air cylinders 21 and the valve axes 22 are provided with pistons 23 which are displaced in cylinders depending on which one of the two pressure air valves 24 and 24 are operated to permit pressure air to be entered into the cylinder 21. The valves can of course be located in the branch conduits at an suitable point between the suction point and the collecting container and be designed as conventional throttle valves or sliding valves. Instead of the method of collecting the waste material by means of a depositing container 15 located under the collecting container 9 as shown in Fig. 2, the waste material which is extracted and collected in the funnel 13 can be transported to a container in a separate pneumatic system. In Fig. 4 it is schematically shown how the under pressure in the collecting container 9 is maintained at a constant level by means of a by pass valve 24, the position of which is controlled by means of a pressure sensing device 26 which is arranged in a servo circuit and which generates pulses to a device 27 controlling the position of the valve. This valve can be connected in a duct 28 through which air is sucked away from the inside of a building. This has the advantage that a substantially constant air flow is sucked away from the interior of the building and that the air speed between the container 9 and the filter 10 also will remain at a constant value. The prerequisite is of course that the under pressure in the collecting container 9 is maintained at a constant level and this is provided by means of the servo system described above. The suction duct 28 could suitably be provided with a noise trap 29. The under pressure in the system is generated by means of a blower 30 schematically indicated in the Figure. The purified air could suitably be used as return air or could be exhausted to the open air through a heat exchanger. The amount of air which needs to be transported in a system of the kind described above will be substantially less than in a conventional system and it will substantially correspond to the amount of fresh air required. This is due to the fact that the transportation of waste material from each machine will only be in operation when any working operation is effected in the machine. This operation of the machine is controlled by means of the pressure air controlled valves shown in Fig. 3 and the control is effected by means of a switch or a photoelectric cell on the machine table, which will be affected when the machine is taken into operation.
