# A process for treating an article made of metal selectec from tantalum, niobium and tantalum niobium alloy.

## Abstract
A process is described for coating an article made of tantalum, niobium or tantalum niobium alloy with a film containing polycrystalline lithium metal oxide wherein the metal corresponds to the metal from which the article is made. More particularly, the process improves the surface properties including hardness H It is found that tantalum spinnerets treated in accordance with the process according to the present invention have longer operating life, clog less and produce a better quality fiber.
