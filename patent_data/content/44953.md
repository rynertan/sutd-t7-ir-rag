# Optical fiber alignment mechanism and connectors using the same.

## Abstract
Optical fiber alignment mechanism comprising at least an optical fiber 77 , at least three rigid members 76a, b, c with a circular cross section including rods, which rigid members are arranged to surround said optical fiber 77 and of which each is in tangential contact with said optical fiber 77 as well as with two other rigid members 76a, b, c , and a plastic member 78 molded in a plug like shape to contain said fiber and rigid members in lump, the outer surface of said plastic member allowing said rigid members to be exposed tangentially at least at three por tions thereon.
