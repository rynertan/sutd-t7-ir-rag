Exptl. Clin. Pharmacol. 3 6 397 401 1981 J. Roca, M. Grau and J. Balasch., the measurement of cerebral blood flow was performed by attaching an electro magnetic blood flow transducer to the vertebral artery of the anesthetized dogs.After orotraqueal intubation, artificial respiration with normal air was instituted using a Manley Pulmovent respirator. The correct ventilation of the dogs was checked after all the surgical procedures by determining the p02, pC02, and pH in arterial blood samples, as well as several times during the experiment by means of an Astrup apparatus. Blood pressure was measured in left saphenous artery by means of a Bell Howell pressure transducer, and the heart rate by means of a Beckman ECG device.Recordings were made on an ink writing Beckman polygraph. Left saphenous vein and right saphenous artery were cannulated with polyethylene catheters for drug administration and blood collection respectively.Vertebral blood flow was measured by a non cannulating electro magnetic flowmeter Carolina Medical Electronics placed in the vertebral artery.The Carolina digital flowmeter was connected to an Omniscribe HoustonInstruments plotter.Piracetam and nicotinic acid were used as control drugs.The results are shown in the following table TABLE ICONTROL AND SYNTHETIZED DRUGS EFFECT DOSEPiracetam No effectPapaverine Active 0.5 mg kgNicotinic acid No effect cis trans 3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexyl Active 1 mg kg 2 oxo l pyrrolidineacetate cis 3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexyl 2 2 oxo Active 0,5 mg kg 1 pyrrolidinyl butyrbate 2 oxo l pyrrolidineacetamide INESPECIFIC PROTECTION AGAINSTLETALITY BY NOOTROPIC DRUGSIt is known that the nootropic drugs, as Piracetam, as well as the phenobarbital or hydantoine have a protection on the survival time of animals. When the subjects are submitted to several types of hypoxia, the letality is significantly diminished by the protection given by the nootropic drug.In the intention to increase the accuracy, we have a three trials panel in order to study the effect of the new synthetized drugs.We have chosen the hypoxia hypobara the decompression kills the animals, because of the lack of 02. The survival time is clearly increased by the active drugs.The second trial is the quick decapitation of mouse. The head has a typical mandibular movement, known as gasping, as searching the breathing air. The gasping time is well prolonged by the active drugs.The third trial is by CNK. Obsviously CNK kills the animals. Again the protected animals live a good number of seconds more than the controls.The summary of results is found in Table II.
