# Measurement apparatus.

## Abstract
A measurement apparatus for converting a physical quantity into a digital quantity and effecting predetermined arithmetic operations based on the digital quantity to mea sure the physical quantity, includes a detector 1 and or a converter 3 for providing a pulse signal having a frequency dependent on the physical quantity a first counter circuit 4 counting the pulses of the pulse signal supplied from said detector and or said converter and producing a count output when the count reaches a predetermined value a second counter circuit 5 starting to count clock pulses supplied from a clock signal source 6 when measurement starts and stopping the clock pulse count in response to the count output from said first counter circuit a digital processing circuit 7 for reading a count in said second counter circuit 5 in response to the count output from said first counter circuit 4 and for effecting predetermined arithmetic opera tions based on the count from said second counter circuit 5 whereby said physical quantity can be measured as a result of said arithmetic operations. The measurement ap paratus when used in combination with means having an electric to optical transducer for converting a result of measurement into optical information and delivering such optical information to an upper processor may further com prise an optical to electric transducer PD for converting optical information received from said upper processor into an electric signal said measuring unit being coupled through a transmitting unit including said transducers to said upper processor for optical information transmission between said measuring unit and said upper processor.
