# POLYMERISATION CATALYST

## Abstract
A modified catalyst suitable for polymerising 1 olefins pre pared by 1 heat activating a Phillips chromium oxide refractory oxide catalyst and 2 contacting the active catalyst with a transition metal compound containing at least one pi bonded ligand. Preferred transition metals in the pi bonded compound are titanium, vanadium and chromium the pi bonded ligand can be an arene eg benzene , a cyclic carbanion eg cyclopen tadienyl or a cyclic corbonium ion eg cycloheptatrienyl . Titanium 0 ditoluene is preferred. The catalyst can be used to co polymerise ethylene to give polyolefins having medium to broad molecular weight distribution.
