1. Tablets for the preparation of tablets containing trimethoprim or a salt thereof and a sulfonamide or a salt thereof in a ratio between 1 20 and 20 1, the total weight of said ingredients being from 80 to 98 of the total weight of the tablet, characterized in that they comprise an ion exchanger of the artificial resin type.

## Description
This invention relates to tablets containing an admixture of 2,4 diamino 5 3,4,5 trimethoxybenzyl pyrimidine trimetho prim and a sulfonamide. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising said ingredients are well known for the treatment of microbially infected animals and humans. They usually contain trimethoprim and a sulfonamide in a ratio of 1 5 and the dosages of the mixture commonly given to adult patients are from 100 to 1000 mg. When conventional pharmaceutical techniques are employed, the amount of active ingredients in a tablet should not exceed 80 w w . A larger percentage will give tablets with poor physical properties, such as a high disintegration or dissolution time, a high friability value or a low hardness value. Conventional tablets containing high doses of trimethoprim and a sulfonamide consequently have a large size, which makes them difficult to swallow for a patient. Attempts have been made to produce tablets with more than 80 of the said ingredients which still show satisfactory physical characteristics. Such a tablet is disclosed in GB 1499672. According to this patent tablets containing trimethoprim and a sulphonamide e.g. sulphamethoxazole are prepared which contain 80 to 98 w w of active ingredients. In addition to the active ingredients the tablets comprise a disintegrating agent having a swelling capacity greater than 5 ml g and a granulating agent. The prescribed particle size, defined in terms of weight median diameter , of the active ingredients is less than 40 m, preferably much less. Acccording to GB 1499672, the tablets have a disintegration time of from 5 minutes and 25 seconds to nine minutes. In practice, when the disintegration agent is a strongly swelling agent, it becomes slimy and sticky on contact with a small quantity of liquid and this tends to commence already in the mouth and may result in a lingering bitter aftertaste. It has now been found that tablets comprising a large amount of trimethoprim and a sulfonamide and having satisfactory physical properties can be obtained by incorporating in them instead of a swelling agent an ion exchanger of the artificial resin type. The use of ion exchangers in the preparation of solid pharmaceutical compositions is already known, e.g. from GB 791,281, but this patent specification does not disclose a method for the preparation of compositions with a high percentage of active ingredients. The compositions described therein contain a relatively large amount of other excipients, particularly lactose, which by its hydrophilic character promotes the penetration of liquid in the tablet. According to the present invention tablets comprising a total amount of trimethoprim and a sulfonamide from 80 to 98 w w in a ratio of 1 20 to 20 1 are obtained by incorporating in them an ion exchanger of the artificial resin type. The tablets of the invention do not need to contain a large amount of lactose or any other hydrophilic agents such as maize starch or microcrystalline cellulose. It will be appreciated that the ion exchanger should be pharmaceutically acceptable. This implies that the ion exchanger should not have a biological effect of its own in the doses used and that it should have a high degree of purity and a small particle size. Pharmaceutically acceptable ion exchangers, meeting these requirements, are available, inter alia under the trade name Amberlite . In view of the poor solubility of trimethoprim it would be expected that tablets with an acceptable disintegration time could only be obtained by using a swelling agent with a high swelling capacity, as described in GB 1499672. It has surprisingly been found that such a swelling agent is not necessary in the tablets of the invention. Actually, with the ion exchangers of the present invention substantially shorter disintegration times were obtained. Moreover, the ion exchangers used in the tablets of the present invention have the advantage that they do not give a slimy, sticky mass in contact with a liquid. Preferred ion exchangers are copolymers of divinylbenzene with styrene or methacrylic acid and phenol polyamines, particularly the divinylbenzene copolymers. Most preferred are weakly acid cation exchangers consisting of methacrylic acid divinylbenzene copolymer with free carboxyl groups, such as Amberlite IRP 88. The ion exchangers is preferably used in an amount from 1 to 8 w w of the total tablet. More preferably 2 6 is used. The ratio of trimethoprim and sulfonamide is preferably 1 5. A preferred sulfonamide is sulfamethoxazole 3 4 aminobenzenesulphonamido 5 methyl isoxazole . The tablets may further contain excipients commonly used in pharmacy, such as filling, binding, swelling, lubricating, wetting, granulating, flavoring and colouring agents. Examples of such additives are polyvinylpyrrolidone, magnesium stearate, highly purified silicon dioxide, sodium dioctysulfosuccinate, cellulose derivatives e.g. sodium carboxymethylcellulose and gelatin. For the purpose of the invention trimethoprim and the sulfonamide may be used as such or in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, i.e. salts which are not harmful for the human or animal organism in the doses to be administered. Examples of such salts are hydrohalides e.g. the hydrochloric or the hydrobromide , the citrate, lactate, glutaminate and methylsulfonate of trimethoprim and the salts of sulfonamides with bases such as sodium hydroxide, ammonia, and amines e.g. alkanolamines such as ethanolamine . According to a feature of the invention the tablets are prepared by mixing trimethoprim and a sulfonamide, granulating the mixture with a suitable liquid, mixing the granulate with the other ingredients and compressing tablets from the mixture obtained. The granulating liquid is preferably a protic solvent, such as ethanol or water or mixtures thereof, which may contain one or more additives, such as binding and wetting agents, for instance polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate, gelatin or sorbitol. The preferred solvent is ethanol. The ion exchanger may be mixed with the active agents to be incorporated in the granulate, but it may also be added entirely or partly after granulation. The tablets of the invention show satisfactory hardness and friability and they comply with the usual standards with respect to disintegration time. The invention also includes dispersable tablets and their preparation. Such tablets may be obtained by incorporating a relatively large amount of the disintegrating agent, preferably 4 6 . Suitable disintegrating agents for dispersable tablets are Amberlite resins of the types IRP88, IRP 67M and IRP 69M.
