# Circuit arrangements for processing digital data.

## Abstract
A circuit arrangement for processing analog audio data into a format for transmitting, receiving and playing back in a video format, the arrangement comprising an analog to digital converter 12 for receiving the analog audio data, a large scale integration circuit 10 with clock, read write, input, output, chip select, data and address terminals for receiving the output of the converter 12 , a random access memory 25 connected to the read write, data and address terminals of the large scale integration circuit 10 , a tri state buffer circuit 30 coupled to supply outputs to data terminals D₀ to D₃ of the large scale integration circuit 10 and to receive an input from one of the chip select terminals CS₃ , and switches 31 to 34 connected to the tri state buffer circuit 30 .
