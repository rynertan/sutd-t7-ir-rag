## Description
The present invention relates to an electrical connecting terminal for a connector, comprising an elongated flat base portion, a female contact portion formed at one end portion of said base portion, and comprising a pair of opposing elastic contact segments, a pair of engaging segments formed at an intermediate portion of said base portion, for restricting outward deformation of said contact segments, and a terminal portion formed at the other end of said base portion. In conventional electrical connecting terminals female contact segments can easily be deformed by wiggle movement of the male pin, which occurs when a male pin is inserted or pulled out. The deformation is permanent, and results in poor contact with the male pin. In U.S. Patent 3,363,224 this deformation by wiggle movements of a male pin is prevented by using engaging segments restricting outward deformation of the contact segments. In the flat metal plate prior to bending to obtain a box contact, these engaging segments and the elastic contact segments form one part. Then the elastic contact segments and engaging segments are severed and the engaging segments are coined, such that their ends are beyond the ends of the elastic contact segments such that upon deformation of the elastic contact segments these will engage the engaging segments. This known female connector comprises a bottom portion, two side portions and a top or roof portion, forming an elongated box which gives the connector sufficient mechanical strength against deformation forces. The present invention provides an electrical connecting terminal for a connector of general right angled U shaped cross section which prevents excessive deformation of contact segments when pins are inserted or pulled out. According to the present invention, there is provided an electrical connecting terminal in which said contact portion comprises a pair of support segments extending upwards in a lateral direction from two side edges of said one end portion of said flat base portion, such that said one end portion and said support segment form a right angled U shaped opening for insertion of a male pin Design Engineering, Vol. 2, August 1984, pages 29, 32, also discloses a box shaped connecting terminal comprising a female contact having two elongated elastic contact segments and engaging segments as in US Patent 3,363,224. The remaining two elongated side portions of this box connector show wrinkle portions. However, this publication does not mention the purpose of these wrinkle portions. Stretching elastic contact segments to meet an engaging segment is known per se from Research Disclosure , No. 160, August 19, 1977, page 51. An embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 1 to 3. Fig. 1 shows an electrical connecting terminal for a connector. The terminal shown in Fig. 1 has elongated flat base portion 20. Contact portion 23 is formed on one end of portion 20 in the longitudinal direction, and terminal portion 30 is formed on the other end thereof. Portion 23 has a pair of opposing elastic contact segments 21, and a pair of opposing support segments 22. Segments 22 extend from two side edges in the lateral direction of portion 20 to be substantially perpendicular to the surface of portion 20. Segments 21 extend slightly inward from the corresponding side edges of segments 22 toward portion 30. Furthermore, segments 21 are bent slightly outward at their central portions so that their distal ends free ends are substantially parallel to each other. A pair of engaging segments 24 are formed on the center of portion 20 to restrict outward deformation of segments 21. Segments 24 extend from two edges in the lateral direction of portion 20 in substantially the same direction as segments 21. Portion 30 has two urging portions 25 and 26. Portions 25 and 26 have slots 25a and 26a, which have a substantially U shaped cross section and receive a single wire not shown from which a distal end coating is removed. Slot 25a is narrower than slot 26a. Portion 25 is located between portion 26 and segments 24, and the core wire of the wire is urged against portion 25 to electrically connect the core wire to the electrical connecting terminal. The wire is also urged on portion 26 to fix it on the terminal. Wrinkle portion 27 is formed by pressing that part of portion 20 which corresponds to segments 21, so as to cross portion 20. The upper surface of portion 27 turns outward, and the lower surface thereof is recessed. Portion 27 is formed, contracting portion 20 in the longitudinal direction by a predetermined length, whereby the distal ends of segments 21 are located between segments 24. More specifically, portion 27 is formed, positioning segments 21 such that the distal ends of segments 21 can engage with segments 24 when they are excessively deformed outward. Fig. 3 shows plate 10, which is used to form the electrical connecting terminal shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Plate 10 can be obtained by punching a metal plate e.g., phosphor bronze with good conductivity and elasticity. Plate 10 has portion 11 extending in the longitudinal direction thereof. Portion 11 is used as base portion 20 of the electrical connecting terminal Figs. 1 and 2 . A pair of rectangular elongated holes 12 are formed in one end portion of plate 10 and extend in the longitudinal direction of plate 10. Holes 12 are located on the sides of portion 11. Two sides of plate 10 opposite to the long sides of holes 12 are notched. Portions 17 of plate 10 are sheared along lines extending outward from the short sides of holes 12 near the center of plate 10, thereby forming a pair of portions 13 adjacent to portion 11 at one end and used as contact segments 21 and support segments 22 Figs. 1 and 2 . Two notches are cut in either long side portion of plate 10, on the right side of portion 17, thus forming a pair of portions 14, a pair of portions 15, and a pair of portions 16. The bottoms of each row of notches are aligned with the surfaces of holes 12 nearest the center of plate 10. Portions 14 are used as engaging segments 24. Portions 15 are used as a part of urging portion 25. Portions 16 are used as a part of urging portion 26. A portion extending from one end portion to the central portion of plate 10 is bent substantially vertically along holes 12. As a result, contact segments 21 and support segments 22 shown in Figs. 1 and 2 are formed from portions 13. Engaging segments 24 shown in Figs. 1 and 2 are formed from portions 14. Note that the bent shape of segments 21 has already been described . The other end portion of plate 10 is bent into a U shape, in the longitudinal direction. As a result, urging portion 25 is formed from portions 15 and the corresponding part of portion 11, and urging portion 26 is formed from portions 16 and the corresponding part of portion 11. As described above, the electrical connecting terminal shown in Figs. 1 and 2 can be formed by bending plate 10 of Fig. 3, which has been obtained by punching a metal plate. It is difficult to locate the distal ends of segments 21 between segments 24 using only the above bending process. This is because portions 13 and 14 are positioned adjacent to each other and sandwich portions 17 therebetween. In this state, when segments 21 are greatly deformed outward, it is impossible to engage their distal ends with segments 24. In this embodiment, wrinkle portion 27 Fig. 2 is formed in that part of portion 20 which corresponds to segments 21. Due to this wrinkle portion 27, distance D between segments 22 and 24 Fig. 2 is shorter by a predetermined value than distance D for which the parts of portion 13 corresponding to segments 22 and 24 are separated before the bending process. Distance D is equal to the length which hole 12 has before the bending process. In this way, the distal ends of segments 21 can be located between segments 24 so that they are engaged with the latter when segments 21 greatly deformed outward. A connector socket not shown is constituted by mounting a plurality of electrical connecting terminals Figs. 1 and 2 in a connector housing. When a plug not shown having a plurality of male pins is fitted in the socket, each pin is inserted in contact portion 23 of the corresponding terminal. Thus, the pin is brought into elastic contact with a pair of contact segments 21 of portion 23, thereby electrically connecting the pin and the terminal. When the plug is inserted in or pulled out from the socket, wiggle occurs in the socket or plug. The distal ends of segments 21 are elastically deformed outward by wiggle movement of the pin. When wiggle is considerable, segments 21 are significantly deformed. In this case, the distal ends of segments 21 are engaged with segments 24, thereby restricting the further outward deformation of segments 21. Hence, permanent deformation of segments 21 can be prevented. With the terminal of the present invention, even when a wire with a large diameter is forcibly inserted between segments 21 and deforms them during a wire urging or harness operation, deformation is kept to a minimum. The embodiment of the present invention has been described. However, the present invention is not limited to the particular embodiment, and various other changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. For example, a plurality of wrinkle portions 27 can be formed, and can project upward or downward. Both upward and downward projections can be formed. Terminal portion 30 can comprise a male pin which is inserted in a through hole of a printed circuit board.
