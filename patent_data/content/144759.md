# Sample and hold circuit.

## Abstract
The sample and hold circuit includes a capacitor C1 and first NPN and PNP transistors Q10, Q12 for respectively controlling the charge and discharge of the capacitor C1 . The first NPN and PNP transistors Q10, Q12 are fed with base currents from the second PNP and NPN transistors Q14, Q18 . The sample and hold circuit further includes a driving controller 38 . The driving controller 38 periodically bypasses the base currents of the first NPN and PNP transistors Q10, Q12 .
