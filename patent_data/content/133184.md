# Hydraulic control system for automatic transmission.

## Abstract
A single accumulator 40 is operatively connected to a fluid operated clutch C3 so as to retard a rise in fluid pressure supplied to the fluid operated clutch C3 which is to be engaged during a downshift from the highest speed ratio to any one of the lower speed ratios and when the transmission shifts from a neutral to a forward drive.
