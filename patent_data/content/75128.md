## Description
DESMUTAGEN AND THE USE THEREOF AS WELL AS A METHOD FOR INACTIVATING MUTAGENS.This invention relates to a desmutagen and the use thereof as well as a method for inactivating mutagens. More particularly, the invention relates to desmutagens for inactivating mutagens in foods, foodstuffs, food additives and tobaccos and a method for inactivating mutagens in such materials. Recently, a survey relating to the causes of cancer in human tissue or organs has caused public attention to be drawn to many mutagens.which cause mutation in living organisms. It is still not clear whether every mutagen is a carcinogen. However, it is at least an established fact that there is a close qualitative.correlation between in vitro mutagenicity and in vivo carcinogenicity. Therefore, there have been designed some biological assays for mutagenicity such as Ames test in which reverse mutation of microorganisms is used as the parameter Ames et al., Mutation Research,Vol. 31, pp. 347 364 1975 . Such methods have broadly been utilized for the preliminary detection of. carcinogens in every day substancs. However, even though such detections or assays are very precise it is not possible to consider factors which effect living things. Moreover, some of the material which may be carcinogens have been used since ancient times. Therefore, it is legally difficult to ban them even thoughthey contain mutagens. Some examples of foods which are proved to contain carcinogens or mutagenic are tobaccps baked foods such as baked fishes, beefsteaks, baked meat and hamburgers. Some drinks which are believed to contain carcinogens or mutagens are caffeine drinks suc as coffee, black tea, etc., alcoholic drinks such as brandy, bourbon and rum. Even some natural foods per se, stich as bracken ferm, are believed to possess carcinogenic ity Evans et al., 1965 Hirono et awl., 1975 . In addition to foods and foodstuffs, it is well known that tobacco tar contains some carcinogens such as 3,4 benzpyrene. The presence of mutagens in many foods and foodstuffs is very common. These foods are eaten even though it is undesirable with respect to preventive medicine and eugenics. It would be extremely difficult to halt the consumption of such. foods. Particularly, if the food is itself a natural food, it would be nearly impossible to legally ban the consumption of such foods. The object of the present invention is to increase the safety of foods. Accordingly, another object is to eliminate or inactivate mutagens contained in such foods. Several attempts have previously been made to decrease the mutagen of various materials such as tobacco, for example, by the addition of tannic acid or sugars, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application COPI Nos. 15681 81, 136597 78 and 91197 78 the term OPI as used herein refers to a published unexamined Japanesepatent application 1 . However, such previous attempts have been ineffective against mutagens in foods and foodstuffs. As a result of our earnest investigations regarding the inactivation of mutagens in foods and tabaccos, we have found that inorganic sulfites, acidic sulfites hydrogen sulfites , pyrosulfites and dithionites or sulfurous anhydride have a strong effect as desmutagens. Among these inorganic compounds, sodium sulfite, sodium hydrogen sulfite, sodium dithionite and sulfurous anhydride or the like have been used for purposes such as bleaching agents and preservatives or antioxidants for foods. Therefore, these materials are available as food additives. However, the use of such materials as desmutagen to suppress mutagenic properties for foods or tobaccos is entirely new. In accordance with the present invention the mutagenicity of diacetyl or glyoxal can be inactivated by applying at least about 3 molar equivalents of sulfurous acid ion CSO3 to said substance. The mutagenicity of coffee irrespective of whether it is regular or instant can be.entirely or nearly inactivated in the presence of sulfites of 20 to 240 ppm as sulfur dioxide. Similarly, the mutagenicity of an alcoholic beverage such as bourbon whisky, apple brandy and rum or the like can also be inactivated entirely or nearly by the addition of 20 to 300 ppm of sulfites. Moreover, mutagens in tobacco tar can be inactivated with sulfites or sulfurous anhydride. The present inventors have also found that the above desmutagenic action is almost equally demonstrated with acidic sulfites CIHSO3 M is a monovalent metal atom here and below , pyrosulfites M2S205 and dithionites M2SzO as well as sulfites and sulfur dioxide sulfurous anhydride3 disclosed above. In addition, it has been found that within the range of the above concentration, the addition of such sulfur centaininginorganic compounds do not affect the flavor and taste of the treated foods or tobaccos. Therefore, based on the above finding, the present invention is directed to a desmutagen essentially containing sulfites, acidic sulfites, pyrosulfites, dithionites or sulfurous anhydride as the effective agent, as well as the use of such compounds on foods and foodstuffs, food additives, beverages and tobaccos. In this invention, the salts of sulfurcontaining acids except sulfurous anhydride may be used in the forms of nontoxic metallic salts. For example, it is possible to use an alkali metal salt such as a sodium or potassium salt an alkaline earth metal salt such as a calcium or magnesium salt and an aluminum salt, or an. ammonium salt. It should be noted that sodium salts and potassium salts are particularly useful in view of their water solubility and stability as well as the fact that it is now possible to use such materials as food additives.Typical examples of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts of sulfur containing acids which can be used in the present invention are sulfites such as Na2SO3, K2S03, CaSO3, MgS03, Al OH4 SO3, tNH4 2So3 and the like, hydrogen sulfites such as DISO3, NaHSO3, Ca HSO3 2 and the like, pyrosulfites such as K2S205,Na2S205, NH4 2S205 and the like, dithionites such as Na2S2O, NH 2S2O and the like. Of these inorganic sulfites, Na2SO3 and NaHSO3 are preferred.Table 1 summarizes the constitutions and decomposing points of the typical salts available. The figures in the brackets show the decomposing temperature.

Only present in the form of solution. The desmutagens of the present invention are usually used in the form of powder or solution and are applied to foods or tobaccos by mixing homogeneously therewith. However, fumigation with gaseous SO2 in a closed chamber is also effective, if desired. Alternatively, if the object is coffee, the above desmutagens may be mixed with sugars, coffee cream coffee whitener or powdered cream or the like in the form of powder or solution. If the object is regular coffee, the filter paper or cloth which is used for filtering percolate or eluate from coffee beans may be impregnated with appropriate salts solutions. Furthermore, if the object is tobacco, a water solution of the above salts or a flavoring sherry into which the salts have been dissolved is applied to tobacco leaves.If the object is cigarettes, the cigarette paper per se or filter there for may be impregnated with the salt solution. The present invention is further illustrated more in detail by the following Example. EXAMPLEI.

On the other hand, predetermined amounts of potassium sulfite, sodium hydrogen sulfite, potassium pyrosulfite, sodium dithionite or sulfurous anhydride were dissolved in water, respectively, and 50 uZ of each of the solutions were mixed. e An example using tobacco tar is no described.Tobacco tar collected by an automatic smoking machine was dissolved into dimethyl sulfoxide 8hereinafter abbreviated as DMSO t . On the other hand, predetermined amounts of sodium sulfite, sodium hydrogen sulfite, potassium pyrosulfite, sodium dithionite and sulfurous anhydride were dissolved in distilled water, and 50 pQ of each of the solution were admixed together. The control was 50 DMSO solution. f An example using an alcoholic beverages is now described. Predetermined amounts of sodium sulfite, sodium hydrogen sulfite, potassium pyrosulfite, sodium dithionite and sulfurous anhydride were dissolved in 1.0 ml of distilled water, respectively. The solutions thus obtained were immediately added to alcoholic beverages, and the mixtures were allowed to stand for 30 minutes. Samples of these beverages having a volume of 25 to 50 ml were dried over a rotary evaporater at less than 400C and the dry matter from each sample was then dissolved into 1 mt of DMSO. iv Measurement of the mutagenicityTo 100 pt of each sample obtained by subparagraphs a to f , iii , aforementioned 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and 0.1 mt of the Salmonella culture aforementioned TA 100 strain were added. The mixture was incubated for 20 minutes at 370C and then added onto 2 mt of soft agar. Thereafter the second mixture was spread on 0.1 glucose agar plate. To the above soft agar was added previously histidine in an amount of 0.1 mole 2 ml of soft agar plate which is necessary for several fissions of the bacteria on the plate. The plate was allowed to incubate for 48 hours at 370C and then the number of 8 colonies per 10 surviving bacteria cells was enumerated as the mutant.The inactivation rate was calculated by the following formula number of colonies on the Inactivation Rate 1 plate with desmutagen x 100 C number of colonies on the plate without any desmutagenII. Results i Inactivation of 1,2 dicarbonyls by sodium sulfite The 1,2 dicarbonyl compound diacetyl is reported to be present in coffee Gianturco et al., 1966 .Since diacetyl is volatile, it may not be the main mutagen in coffee. CSee, method for preparation of freshly brewed coffee powder. However, diacetyl and its related compound glyoxal are direct acting mutagens to S. TA 100 like coffee. They were mixed with an excess molar concentration of sulfite. The results obtained are shown in Tables 2 and . From the tables, it is clear that both the mutagenicities of glyoxal and diacetyl are completely inactivated by addition of 8.0 mM and 12 mM, respectively, of sodium sulfite against 2.81 mM of the former and 4.20 mM of the latter, respectively.Therefore, the addition of sodium sulfite would be recommendable to inactivate known mutagens diacetyl and glyoxal in foods and drinks.

Cii Inactivation of the mutagenic activities of regular coffee by the salts of sulfur containing acid Part 1 Each 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg of powdered coffee beans extract prepared by the foregoing method iii , b were dissolved in distilled water.Each of the dissolved extracts made 50 pQ of solution.On the other hand, the salts of sulfur containing acids were dissolved in distilled water in order to make 50 pt containing 240 ug of sulfur dioxide. The solutions were admixed together and the mixture was further admixed with 0.5 ml of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and the above described 0.1 mt of the culture of S. TA 100. The mixture was then incubated in the same manner as described in I above. The results obtained are shown in Table 4.

TA 100 without S9 mix when sodium sulfite was added. S9 mix is required for the metabolic activation of promutagen Pro. Natl. Acad. Sci.USA, Vol. 70 8 , pp. 2281 2285 1973 . Killing effect of coffee on S. TA 100 was also suppressed by addition of sodium stilfite. Brewed regular or instant coffee made in the ordinary way contains 5 15 mg of dry matter per mZ. Therefore, from Table 4, it can be concluded that the mutagenicities of coffee served on the table were inactivated by adding sulfite at 300 ppm. Coffee was weakly mutagenic on S. typhimurium TA98 without S9 mix about 9 revertants mg of instant coffee and this mutagenic activity was also inactivated by sodium sulfite at the same concentration. Addition of sodium sulfite did not result in formation of any mutagen that was detectable with S. TA 100 or TA 98 and S9 mix. We also tested the effects of sodium hydrogen sulfite, potassium pyrosulfite and sodium dithionite, since these compounds are also used as food additives.These compounds were added in the same molar concentration 3.75 mM as sulfite 300 ppm and they also inactivated the mutagenicity of regular coffee. Since pyrosulfite ion was rapidly converted to hydrogen sulfite ion in water, these chemicals seemed to react with the mutagenic principle s in coffee as hydrogen sulfite. tiii Inactivation of the mutagenic activities of regular coffee by sodium sulfite Part 2 The result of the mutagenicity test in sodium sulfite added coffee powder tspray dried and freezedried prepared by the above described method iii , c was set forth in the following Table 5.

Each 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg of commercially powdered instant coffee was dissolved in distilled water to make 50 l of the solution, respectively. On the other hand, a predetermined amount of sodium sulfite was dissolved into distilled water in order to make 50 pQ of the solution in which the sulfite was contained at concentrations of 0 ppm, 25 ppm, 50 ppm, 80 ppm and 240 ppm as sulfur dioxide, respectively. The two solutions weme mixed together and to the mixture there was added 0.5 ml of phosphate buffer solution and 0.1 ml of the culture as in the regular coffee. The above described test was then repeated five times. The results are shown in the following Table 6.The numerations in the table are the average values of five tests for each.

The brewed or instant coffee made in ordinary way generally contains 5 to 15 mg of dry matter per m . Therefore, from Table 6, it can be concluded that the mutagenicities of coffee served on the table were completely inactivated by addition of sulfite at a concentration of 240 ppm. v The desmutagenic effect of the salts of sulfurcontaining acids on instant coffee Part 2 The following Table 7 shows the results obtained by another test in which sodium sulfite, sodium hydrogen sulfite, potassium pyrosulfite, sodium dithio nite and sulfurous anhydride were added to an instant coffee to make a 240 ppm concentratio of sulfur dioxide. As seen from the table, by adding this amount, the mutagenicity against S. TA 100 is completely eliminated.A blind test was performed to show that the addition of the sulfite at a concentration of 240 ppm as sulfur dioxide had no effects on the growth of the above S.

On the other hand, 50 ug of sodium hydrogen sulfite was dissolved in distilled water and then mixed with the above DSO solution in order to make samples. The results are shown in the following Table 8. As seen from this table, the mutagenicity of tobacco tar is completely inactivated by addition of one tenth the amount of sodium hydrogen sulfite. Other salts of sulfur containing acids had similar effect against the mutagenicity of tobacco tar.

The results are shown in the following Table 10. As understood from the Table 9 the mutagenicity of calvados are completely inactivated by addition of sodium sulfite or sulfurous anhydride corresponding to 150 ppm as sulfur dioxide.

Especially, it has been reported that the incidence of esophageal cancer is high in such places as France, Puerto Rico and U.S.A. where calvados, rum and bourbon whisky are consumed respectively in relatively high quantities, and therefore such alcoholic drinks are considered to contain cancer ducing materials. In factn these spirituous liquors contain mutagenicities in an amount relatively higher than that found in other spirituous liquors. Thus, the inactivation of mutagenicity in these liquors would be advantageous from the standpoint of decrease in incidence of cancer. Another advantage of the present invention is that the addition of desmutagen according to the present invention at a level effective as desmutagen has no adverse effect on the taste and the flavor of foods, drinks and tobaccos. As described hereinbefore in detail, since the present invention is distinctly effective in order to inactivate mutagens in various foods, beverages and tobaccos. Accordingly, the present invention can greatly improve human health, eugenics and preventive medicine by increasing the safety of foods and tobaccos. While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
