# Method of hydrophilizing or hydrophobizing polymers.

## Abstract
A method of modifying the overall hydrophilic or hydrophobic nature of a high molecular weight free radical addition interpolymer, which is an azlactone functional inter polymer, with a hydrophilic or hydrophobic nucleophilic compound is disclosed. Only the surface of the interpolymer can be hydrophilized or hydrophobized, as when the inter polymer is a coating, or the modification can take place throughout the entire bulk of the interpolymer.
