Of the foregoing substituents for the moiety CH2X, preferred are ethyl, n propyl and aminobutyl. Of the l N substituted derivatives of our invention, preferred are the 1 N amino alpha hydroxyalkanoyl 2 hydroxy 2 desamino 4,6 di 0 minoglycosyl 1,3 diaminoxycliotols, particularly the l N Y amino a hydroxybutyryl and the 1 N ss amino a hydroxypropionyl derivatives, particularly valuable compounds being 1 N S gamma amino alpha hydroxybutyryl 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin Cla and l N S ss amino a hydro xypropionyl 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin Cla. It is to be noted that the l N M amino a hydroxy substi tuent in the foregoing 1 N amino hydroxy 2 hydroxy 2 desamino 4,6 di 0 aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocycliotols may be in the R,S form or in the R form or in the S form. In accordance with this invention, each of the foregoing names includes all three forms.Thus, the name l N Q amino a hydroxybutyryl 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin Cla includes l N S Y amino a hydroxybutyryl 2 hydroxy 2 desamino gentamicin Clar 1 N R Y amino a hydroxybutyryl 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamidin C1a and l N R,S g amino a hydroxy butyryl 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin ClaThe pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of this invention may be prepared according to known procedures such as by neutralizing the free base with the appropriate acid, usually to about pH 5. Preferred acids for this purpose are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric and hydrobromic acid.Generally, the acid addition salts are white solids which are soluble in water and insoluble in most polar and nonpolar organic solvents.The process of this invention for the preparation of a 2 hydroxy 2 desamino 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitol having an amino function in position 6 is charactensed in that the corresponding 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitol having an amino function in position 2 wherein all other amino functions are protected by a protecting group, is oxidized by means of hydrogen peroxide in an inert solvent in the presence of tungstate ion at a pH of about 9 to about 11, whereby the molar ratio of hydrogen peroxide to starting compound is at least 2 1, that the soObtained 2 oximino 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diamino cyclitol is subjected to a cleavage of the oxime function that the so obtained 2 oxo 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitol is reduced at the oxo group and that the so obtained compound is subjected to a removal of the protecting groups.For the oxidation in the first step of the process it is necessary to use at least two moles of hydrogen peroxide per mole of aminoglycoside to ensure completion of reaction.Preferably, a four to five molar excess is used, and in certain instances even greater molar excesses of hydrogen peroxide are advantageously employed.The oxidation is usually carried out at room temperature in aqueous methanol, although other lower alkanols, e.g. ethanol and isopropanol, are conveniently employed. In general, however, any organic solvent which will dissolve the aminoglycoside and which does not react with hydrogen peroxide, e.g. dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan and diglyme may be used.After addition of the tungstate ion, it is necessary that the pH of the reaction mixture be maintained between 9 and 11 preferably at pH 10 to pH 10.5 , e.g. by addition of a base sodium hydroxide , in order to minimize side reactions occurring such as glycoside cleavage and protonation of the amine.The reaction is continued until almost all the amino function is consumed as determined by thin layer chromatographic techniques, then the resulting 2 oximino N protected 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitol intermediate is isolated as a mixture of syn and anti isomers utilizing known techniques e.g. extraction and chromatographic techniques .In the second step of the process, the 2 oximino N protected 4,6 di O amiinoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitol prepared as described above is cleaved to the corresponding 2 oxo derivative utilizing known techniques for cleaving oximes. Pre sferabl.y, the cleaving of the 2 oximino function isachieved by an acidic hydrolytic medium in the presence of acetaldehyde e.g by treating a solution of the 2 oixamino deriva tve i.n aceJc.onitrssle w tTh 1N hydrochloric acid containing acetaldehyde or by Reaction of the oximino intermediate with sodium bisulfite followed by mild acid hydrolysis.ThePatter procedure is preferred since greater yields of purer product are usually obLained thereby. when carrying out this procedure, the 2 oximino N protected aminoglycoside intermediate in aqueous ethanol or other aqueous lower alkanol is usually reacted with about three to four molar equivalents of sodium bisulfite at reflux temperature until the oximino junction is consumed as determined by thin layer chromatographic techniques. There is then added a weak acid e.g.acetic acid or oxalic or tartaric acid to produce a mild acid hydrolytic medium the reaction mixture is then heated at reflux temperature until the reaction is complete as evidenced by thin layer chromatographic techniques.Reduction of the 2 oxo N protected aminoglycoside intermediate in the third step is preferentially carried out by reaction with an alkali metal borohydride usually sodium borohydride according to known procedures for reducing a keto group to a hydroxyl function, and there is obtained an excellent yield of N protected 2 hydroxy 2 desamino amino glycoside in which the 2 hydroxyl function is in the equa orial position, i.e. the same stereoconfiguration as the starting 2 amino function. After removal of the N protecting functions according to known techniques, the resulting hydroxy 2 desamino 4,6 di 0 aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitol is isolated and purified utilizing conventional techniques.When carrying out the process, all the functions desired in the final 2 hydroxy 2 desamino derivative may be present in the 4,6 di 0 aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitol precur 3er. Thus, for example, when preparing l N ethyl 2 hydroxy 2 desaminosisomicin, or 5 deoxy 2 hydroxy 2 desaminosisomicin, the corresponding 1 N ethylsisomicin or 5 desoxysisomicin may be used as starting compounds. Alternatively, the 2 amino function in a 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl l,3 diamino cyclitol can be replaced by a hydroxyl group via the process of this invention, then other functions may be introduced into the 2 hydroxy 2 desamino aminoglycoside by methods known in the art.This alternate method is the method of choice when preparing the preferred l N w amino a hydroxy alkanoyl 2 hydroxy 2 desamino derivatives of this invention. Thus, for example, when preparing 1 N S ss amino alpha hydroxy propionyl 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin C la and l N Y amino a hydroxybutyryl 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin Cla, a preferred method involves first converting gentamicin C la to 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin C la via the process of this invention, and thence converting 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin la to the l N S ss amino a hydroxypropionyl or the l N S b amino a hydroxybutyryl 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin Cla utilizing techniques known in the art and as described in the examples. Typical starting compounds are the 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitol antibacterial agents described by formula I in combination with Table I above. Particularly useful starting antibiotic precursors are sisomicin and gentamicin Cla which lead to preferred 2 hydroxy 2 amino derivatives of this invention, and Antibiotic JI 20A which leads to gentamicin B.Other useful starting antibiotic precursors include 5 epi4,6 di 0 amioglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitol antibacterials described in U.S. Patent No. 4,000 ,261 5 epi azido 5 deoxy 4 ,6 di O aminoglycosyl l , 3 diaminocyclitol antibacterialsa described in U.S. Patent No. 4,000,262 1 N alkyl 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitol antibacterials described in U.S. Patent No. 4,002,742 5 deoxy 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitol antibacterials described inU.S. Patent No. 4,053,591 and 5 epi fluoro 5 deoxy 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitol antibacterials described in South African Patent No. 78 0385.A 2 hydroxy 2 desamino 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitol of this invention may be converted to a corresponding l N alkyl derivative or to a corresponding 5 deoxy , or a 5 epi or 5 epi azido 5 deoxy derivative, via procedures analogous to those described in the above mentioned patents.Thus, for example, a 2 hydroxy 2 desamino 4 ,6 di O amino glycosyl 2 deoxystreptamine of this invention e.g. 2 hydroxy 2 desaminosisomicin is converted to the corresponding 5 deoxy derivative e.g. 2 hydroxy 2 desamino 5deoxysisomicin by first converting said 2 hydroxy 2 desamino 4 , 6 di O aminoglycosyl 2 deoxystreptamine to the corresponding N and O protected except for the 5 hydroxyl group intermediate e.g. 1,3,6 tri N benzyloxycarbonyl 2 ,2 di O benzoyl 3 n 4 N,O carbonyl 2 hydròxy 2 desamino sisomicin utilizing known techniques, then converting the 5 hydroxyl group to the 5 O thioformate ester by reaction with the Vilsmaier salt produced from phosgene and N,N di methylformamidein dichloromethane, followed by reaction of the imidinium chloride salt thereby produced e.g. l,3,6 tri N benzylOxycarbonyl 2 ,2 di O benzoyl 3 ,4 N,O carbonyl 2 hydroxy 2 desaminosisomicin 5 O N,N dimethylformimidi nium chloride with hydrogen sulfide in pyridine, thence reaction of the requisite 5 O thioformyl ester thereby formed e. g. 1,3,6 tri N benzyloxycarbonyl 5 O thioformyl 2 ,2 di O benzOyl 3 ,4 N,O carbonyl 2 hydroxy 2 desaminosiso micin with tri n butylstannane in toluene and, finally, removal of the N and O protecting groups in the resulting 5 deoxy derivative via known procedures to obtain a 5 deoxy2 desamino 2 hydroxy compound of this invention e.g. 2 hydrqxy 2 desamino 5 deoxysisomicin .Similarly, a 2 hydroxy 2 desamino 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 2 deoxystreptamine of this invention is converted to the corresponding 5 epi fluoro 5 deoxy derivative according to procedures analogous to those described in South AfricanPatent No. 78 0385, whereby an N and O protected 2 hydroxy 2 desamino 4 ,6 di O aminoglycosyl 2 deoxystreptamine having a free 5 hydroxyl group e.g. 1,3,6 tri N benzyloxycarbonyl 2 ,2 di Obenzoyl 3 ,4 N,O carbonyl 2 hydroxy2 desaminosisomicin is reacted with a dialkylaminosulfur trifluoride, preferably diethylaminosulfur trifluoride in methylene chloride, followed by treatment with sodium bicarbonate and then removal of the N and O protecting groups to obtain a 5 epi fluoro 2 hydroxy 2 desamino 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 2,5 dideoxystreptamine of this invention e.g. 5 epi fluoro 2 hydroxy 2 desamino 5 deoxysisomicin .The N protected starting compounds of our process, wherein all amino functions except the 2 amino group in a 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitol are protected by groups susceptible to reductive cleavage or basic hydrolysis, are conveniently prepared by combining procedures known in the art, together with a selective blocking procedure described in Belgian Patent No. 855704.By the selective blocking procedure, a transition metal salt complex between available neighboring amino and hydroxyl functions in said 4, 6 di O aminoglycosyl 1, 3 diaminocyclitol and cupric acetate or nickel II acetate is first preparedfollowed by introduction of acyl functions on non complexed and or weakly complexed amino functions, and thence removal of said transition metal salt complex by means of hydrogen sulfide or ammonium hydroxide. then preparing N protected starting compounds of saturated aminoglycosides having a primary carbinamine at C 5 , e.g.1,3,6 ,3 tetra N protected gentamicin C it is usually preferred to block the amino functions by hydrocarbonyloxycarbonyl groups which are susceptible to reductive cleavage e.g. with sodium in ammonia or to alkaline hydrolysis, e.g. by utilizing blocking groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, and methoxycarbonyl groups, Such an N protected intermediate, e.g. 1,3,6 , 3 tetra N benzyloxycarbo nylgentamicin Cla, is conveniently prepared by first reacting the unblocked aminoglycoside, e.g. gentamicin Cla, with about two equivalents of N trichloroethoxycarbonyloxy succinimide in methanol in the presence of excess nickel acetate according to the selective blocking procedure whereby, after decomposition of the nickel acetate complex by means ofammonium hydroxide, there is produced 2 ,6 di N trichloroethoxycarbonylgentamicin Cla secondly, preparing the Nbenzyloxycarbonyl derivatives of the remaining amino functions at the 1, 3 and 3 positions via the well known procedure utilizing benzylchloroformate and calcium hydroxide thirdly, treating the resulting l,3,3 tri N benzyloxy carbonyl 2 ,6 di N trichloroethoxycarbonyl gentamicin Cla with z Lnc in acetic acid whereby are removed the trichloro ethoxycarbdnyl groups to produce 1,3,3 triN benzyloxy carbonylgentamicin Cla then, finally, blocking the more reactive 5 primary carbinamine group by reaction of the 1,3,3 l tri N blocked derivative with about one equivalent of N benzyloxycarbonyloxy phthalimide in the presence of excess triethylamine to produce the desired 1,3,6 ,3 tetraN benzyloxycarbonylgentamicin Cla, a requisite intermediate of the process of this invention.When preparing N blocked aminoglycoside staring compounds from saturated 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1, 3 diaminocycli tols having a secondary amino function at the 6 position such as in gentamicin C1 , the requisite 1,3,6 ,3 tetraN blocked intermediate e.g. 1,3,6 ,3 tetra N ethoxycarbo nylgentamicin C1 is preferably prepared by first reacting gentamicin C1 with about one equivalent of N benzyloxycarbonyloxysuccinimide in the presence of about three equivalents of cupric acetate according to the selective blokking procedure whereby, after decomposition of the copper complex with ammonium hydroxide, there is obtained 2 Nbenzyloxycarbonylgentamicin C1.Reaction of the foregoing derivative with over four equivalents of ethoxycarbonyl chloride and sodium carbonate, followed by removal of the 2 benzyloxycarbonyl group via reductive cleavage by means of hydrogen in the presence of palladium on charcoal catalyst yields 1,3,6 ,3 tetra N ethoxycarbonyl gentamicin C1. When preparing 2 hydroxy 2 desamino 4 t 6 di O aminoglyco syl 1,3 diaminocyclitols having double bonds, such as in sisomicin, the N blocking groups in the unsaturated aminocyclitol are preferably N benzoyl blocking groups since such derivatives are less susceptible to glycoside cleavage under the acidic reaction conditions necessary for the deoximation step of this process.Thus, a preferred N blocked sisomicin starting intermediate is 1,3,6 tri N benzoyl 3 N acetyl sisomicin, which is conveniently prepared by first treating sisomicin with excess N benzoyl imidazole followed by treatment of the resulting 6 N benzoylsisomicin with one equivalent of N trichloroethoxycarbonyloxy succinimide in metha nol in the presence of nickel II acetate according to the selective blocking procedure whereby after decomposition of the nickel acetate complex by means of ammonium hydroxide is produced mainly 2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl 6 N benzoyl sisomicin.Treatment of the foregoing with excess benzoic anhydride in methanol yields 1,3,6 tri N benzoyl 2 tri chloroethoxycarbonyloxy sisomicin which, upon reaction with excess acetic anhydride followed by treatment with zinc in acetic acid in methanol yields 1,3,6 tri N benzoyl 3 Nacetylsisomicin.When preparing N protected starting compounds from aminoglycosides having amino groups at the 2 and 6 positions and hydroxyl groups at the 3 and 4 positions e.g. a 1,3,6 3 tetra N protected Antibiotic JI 20A , it is preferred to first protect the 6 position by reacting the aminoglycoside with about one equivalent of N benzyloxycarbonyloxyphthalimide in the presence of about one equivalent of cupric chloride according to the selective blocking procedure whereby, after decomposition of the copper complex with ammonium hydroxide there is obtained the 6 N benzyloxy carbonyl derivative e.g. 6 N benzyloxycarbonyl AntibioticJI 20A .The 2 position is then protected by reaction of the foregoing 6 N substituted derivative with about a mole of either N tert. butoxycarbonyloxyphthalimide or N 2,2,2 tri chloroethoxy cartonyloxyphthalimide in the presence of about an equivalent of nickel acetate according to the selective blocking method whereby, after decomposition of the nickel complex with ammonium hydroxide, the corresponding 2 N tert.butoxycarbonyl or 2 N 2,2, 2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl derivative is formed e.g. 2 N tert butoxyearbonyl or 2 N 2,2,2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl 6 N benzyloxycarbonyl Antibiotic JI 20A .Reaction of the foregoing 2 ,6 di N protected aminoglycoside with over three equivalents of benzyloxy carbonylchloride according to standard blocking procedures, followed by removal fo the 2 N tert. butoxycar bonyl protecting group with trifluoroacetic acid or removal of the 2 N 2,2,2 trichloroethoxy protecting group by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid or zinc and acetic acid in methanol respectively yields a 1,3,6 ,3 tetra N protected Aminoglycoside starting compound of this invention, e.g. 1,3,6 , 311 tetra N benzyloxy Antibiotic JI 20A.It will be obvious to one skilled in the art that other requisite 1,3,6 , 3 tetra N acyl aminoglycoside starting compounds of this process can be prepared by other combinations of acylating procedures known in the art together with the selective blocking procedures disclosed in Belgian PatentNo. 855704.

EXAMPLE 9ACID ADDITION SALTSA. Sulfate Salts Sulfuric Acid Addition Salts Dissolve 5.0 g of 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin Cla in 25 ml water and adjust the pH of the solution to 4.5 with 1 N sulfuric acid. Pour into about 300 ml of methanol with vigorous agitation, continue the agitation for about 10 20 minutes and filter. Wash the precipitate with metha nol and dry at about 600C in vacuo to obtain 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin C1a sulfate. In like manner, the sulfate salt of the compounds of Examples 2 to 8 are prepared.B. Hydrochloride Salts Dissolve 5.0 g of 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin C1a in 25 ml of water. Acidify with 2 N hydrochloric acid to pH 5. Lyophilize to obtain 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin 1a hydrochloride. In like manner, the hydrochloride salt of the compounds of Examples 2 to 8 are prepared.The 2 hydtoxy 2 desamino 4, 6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitols of this invention particularly those wherein the 6 O aminoglycosyl is 6 O garosaminyl and wherein the 1,3 diaminocyclitol is 2 deoxystreptamine and their nontoxic, pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, in general, exhibit broad spectrum antibacterial activity and possess an improved antibacterial spectrum compared to that of the parent antibiotics. This improved spectrum consists of enhanced potency of the claimed compounds against organisms resistant to the parent compound. Thus, for example, compounds of this invention, e.g. 2 hydroxy 2 desamino 4 O aminoglycosyl 6 O garosaminyl 2 deoxystreptamines, are more active against organisms which inactivate the parent antibiotics by acetylation of the 2 amino group.In addition to the foregoing, the 2 hydroxy 2 desamino 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitols and their non toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are, in general, less acutely toxic than their precursor 2 amino parent antibiotics. Particularly valuable are 2 hydroxy 2l desamino gentamicin C1 and 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin ia which derivatives are broad spectrum antibacterial agents, being active against gram positive bacteria e.g. Staphylococcus aureus and gram negative bacteria erg. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as determined by standard dilution tests, inclu dingfibacteria resistant to the parent compound.Most valuable compounds of this invention are the 1 N M amino a hydroxy derivatives of 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogenta micin Cla, particulary 1 N S gamma amino alpha hydroxybutyryl 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin C1. and 1 N 5 13 amino a hydroxypropionyl 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin C1a which exhibit broader spectra of antibacterial activity than the precursor l N unsubstituted 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicinC1a or the corresponding 1 N S amino alpha hydroxyalkanoyl gentamicin C1a. These prefered compounds possess improved potency versus bacteria resistant to the aforementioned precursor compounds, being active against 2 adenylating and 3 acetylating strains of bacteria.Additionally, the foregoing 1 N amino alpha hydroxy derivates of 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin C1a are advantageously less acutely toxic than the corresponding l N i3 amino a hydroxy gentamicine C1a The 2 hydroxy 2 desamino compounds of this invention can be used alone or in combination with other antibiotic agents to prevent the growth or reduce the number of bacteria in various environments. They may be used, for example, to disinfect laboratory glassware, dental and medical equipment contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus or other bacteria inhibited by the 2 hydroxy 2 desamino derivatives of this invention.The activity of the 2 hydroxy 2 desamino 4,6 di O amino glycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitols against gram negative bacteria renders them useful for combatting infections caused by gram negative organisms, e.g. species of Proteus and Pseudomonas. The 2 hydroxy 2 desamino 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitols, e. g. 1 N S gamma amino alpha hydroxybutyryl 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin C1a and l N S ss amino a hydroxypropionyl 2 hydroxy 2 desaminogentamicin C1a, have veterinary applications, particularly in the treatment of mastitis in cattle and Salmonella induced diarrhea in dome stic animals such as the dog and the cat.The dosage administered of the 2 hydroxy 2 desamino 4,6 di 0 aminoglycosyl 1, 3 diaminocyclitols will be dependent upon the age and wieght of the animal species being treated, the mode of administration, and the type and severity of bacterial infection being prevented or reduced. In general, J le dosage employed to combat a given bacterial infection will be similar to the dosage requirements of the corresponding 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitol. The compounds of this invention may be administered orally.They may also be applied topically in the form of ointments, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic, in the form of lotions which may be aqueous, non aqueous or of the emulsion type or in the form of creams. Pharmaceutical carriers useful in the preparation of such formulations will include, for example, such substances as water, oils, greases, polyesters, polyols and the like.For oral administration, the compounds of this invention may be compounded in the form of tablets, capsules, elixirs or the like or may even be admixed with animal feed. It is in these dosage forms that the antibacterials are most effective for treating bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal tract, which infections cause diarrhea.In general, the topical preparations will contain from about 0.1 to about 3.0 g of a 2 hydroxy 2 desamino 4,6 di O amino glycosyl 1,3 diaminociclitol derivative per 100 g of ointment, creams or lotion. The topical preparations are usually applied gently to lesions from about 2 to about 5 times a day.The antibacterials of this invention may be utilized in liquid form such as solutions, suspensions and the like for otic and optic use and may also be administered parenterally via intramuscular injection. The injectable solution or suspension will usually be administered at from about 1 mg to about 10 mg of antibacterial per kilogram of body weight per day divided into about 2 to about 4 doses. The precise dose de pends on the stage and severity of the infection, the susceptibility of the infecting organism to the antibacterial and the individual characteristics of the animal species being treated.The following formulations are to exemplify some of the dosage forms in which the antibacterial agents of this invention and their derivatives may be employed.
