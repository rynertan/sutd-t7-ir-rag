# Process control of continuous sodium limestone flue gas desulfurization system.

## Abstract
A method of controlling the continuous operation of the absorption and regeneration processes of a sodium limestone double alkali flue gas desulfurization system, in which measurements of absorber effluent solution pH or flow diverted for regeneration are used as the primary control parameter governing the limestone addition rate.
