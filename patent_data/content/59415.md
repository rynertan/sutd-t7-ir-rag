# System for demodulation of phase shift keying signals.

## Abstract
In a system for demodulation of phase shift keying signals with a bandpass filter 6a adapted to regenerate a carrier wave from a phase shift keying signal, there are provided means 8 for detecting phase variations in the regenerated carrier wave from the demodulated signal e₁, e₂ , and means 8, 6a for controlling the phase of the carrier wave being passed through the filter 6a on the basis of the detection output e
