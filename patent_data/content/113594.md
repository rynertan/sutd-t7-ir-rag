## Description
Ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus has been used for ultrasonic tomography for obtaining an ultrasonic tomogram of the human body. The apparatus includes a means for emitting and for receiving sound waves. An electro sound transducer is a device for emitting sound waves and for receiving sound echoes by converting electric signals to sonic power and vice versa, utilizing a piezo electric effect employing lead zirconate titanate PZT , for instance. The technology of focusing and scanning sound beams has many resemblances to micro wave technology. A pulse echo method can be likened to a Radar system. When electric pulse signals are applied to a transducer, the transducer radiates or emits sound pulses towards a target such as a human body , and receives sound echoes from the target. The received sound echoes are converted into electric signals which contain information concerning distances between the transducer and the target. The intensity of a reflected sound echo depends upon the acoustic impedance and transmission characteristics of the target. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 schematically illustrate previous probes which radiate emit receive and scan sound waves using only one transducer element. In Fig. 1, 101 is a transducer which consists of one transducer element hereinafter referred to as element 101 and which generates a single sound beam 1001. 101 1 is a transducer mount or base on which three or four elements, for instance, are mounted. Mount 101 1 is rotated to effect scanning over an angular range W1 as indicated by broken lines in Fig.1. 201 is a part of a transducer housing called a probe unit. 30 is a target such as a human body. 401 is a window made of acoustically transparent material which has almost the same acoustic impedance as the target 30 and is provided in an outer surface of probe unit 201. Window 401 seals in an acoustic transmission medium M , as described below, and contacts the target 30 to reduce ultrasonic loss between the probe unit 201 and the target 30. The acoustic transmission medium M is , for example, silicon rubber, water, or castor oil, filling the space between element 101 and window 401. Medium M has almost the same acoustic impedance as the window 401, to reduce ultrasonic loss between element 101 and window 401. In Fig. 2, 102 is a transducer which consists of one transducer element and generates a single sound beam 1002. 202 is a probe unit, 402 is a window, and 502 is an acoustic reflector placed in a sound path between element 102 and window 402. Reflector 502 oscillates for scanning single beam 1002 over an angular scanning range W2 as indicated by broken lines in Fig. 2. A sound path between element 102 and window 402 is filled by an acoustic transmission medium M, as described in respect of Fig. 1. Received electronic signals are usually displayed on a cathode ray tube in synchronism with scanning, to provide visible information an ultrasonic tomogram on the basis of sound echoes. Recently, technology has advanced to provide the array transducer. The array transducer utilizes advanced technology for fabrication and control of a multi element transducer. The array transducer generates, focuses, and scans a synthesized sound beam SS beam . The array transducer is a combination of small transducer elements. Wave fronts of single beams from each small transducer element are combined together to form an SS beam. This SS beam can be focused or scanned by controlling the phase or sequence of the electric pulse signals applied to the elements of the array. Synthesis of a sound beam or phase control of sequential pulse signals applied to each element of an array transducer can be effected by an electric delay line or a sequential switch control circuit. Signals received by each transducer element are processed to produce signals for providing a display, using the same delay line or the same sequential switch control circuit. There are two kinds of array transducer, one is a phased array transducer and the other is a linear array transducer. Fig. 3 shows schematically a probe unit having a phased array transducer. 203 is a probe unit, 103 is a phased array transducer which is composed of a plurality of transducer elements 1031. The elements 1031 are arranged in a plane and installed on an outer face of probe 203. All of elements 1031 are activated at the same time but the phases of the electric pulse signals applied to the individual elements 1031 are controlled to generate and scan an SS beam 1003 over an angular scanning width W3 as indicated by broken lines in Fig.3. A linear array transducer, on the other hand, generates an SS beam by using a sub group of the elements of the array transducer, consisting of four or five elements, for instance. This SS beam is shifted in parallel transversely across the transducer by shifting elements making up the sub group one by one along the array line of the transducer, by sequentially switching pulse signals applied to the sub group elements. Fig. 4 shows schematically a typical probe unit having a linear array transducer. 204 is a probe unit, 1034 is a linear array transducer, which is arranged in a plane and installed on an outer face of probe 204, having a plurality of elements 1041. Sequential switching of pulse signals applied to the individual elements of sub group 1042 is controlled by a sequential switch control circuit to generate SS beam 1004 and make it shift in parallel transversely of the beam direction as shown by arrow W4 over a range indicated by broken lines. Fig.5 and 6 show special probe units having array transducers using linear array techniques. Fig. 5 illustrates schematically a probe unit 205 using a concave linear array transducer 105 which has sub group of elements 1052. Sub group 1052 generates an SS beam 1005 which is scanned over a scanning angular width W5 as indicated by broken lines. Transducer 105 is located within the probe 205, so that scanning of a target 30 over scan width W5 can be effected, and thus a window 405 and a medium M are required. This concave linear array system is able to sector scan a sound beam as with a phase array system with a high angular resolution. More detail is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. jitsukosho 52 41267. Fig. 6 illustrates schematically a probe unit 206 using a convex linear array transducer 106 which has a sub group of elements 1062. Sub group 1062 generates SS beam 1006 and scans over an angular scanning width W6 as indicated by broken lines. An acoustic transmission medium M is provided between the transducer and a window in the probes of Figs. 1,2,and 5. This medium is intended to reduce ultrasonic power losses. However, it is difficult to make the acoustic impedances of the medium and the window exactly equal, and consequently a part of a radiated sound wave is reflected back at the surface of the window towards the transducer and a part of the reflected sound wave is reflected again by the surface of the transducer towards the window. Thus acoustic multi reflection occurs in the acoustic path between the transducer and the window. Acoustic multi reflection occurs not only in relation to a window but also in relation to a target because, as shown in Figs. 1 to 6, there are acoustic boundaries within a human body, such as the surface of the skin 31, and boundary 32 between different tissues near the skin 31. In Figs. 1 to 6, arrowed lines 2001, ,2006 indicate sound waves reflected from windows and target boundaries, and it will be evident that multi reflection will occur in a center part of the scanning angular width in the case of Figs. 1,2,3 and 5, and over the whole scanning angular width in the case of Figs. 4 and 6. Fig.7 shows patterns of received signals. In Fig. 7, the horizontal axis corresponds to time T, and the vertical axis corresponds to signal amplitude A. Fig.7 a illustrates ideal received signals, without any multi reflection effects. 71 is a transmitting pulse, 72 is an echo signal from a window, 73 is an echo signal from the region of the surface of a human body skin 31 and boundary 32 , 74 are echo signals from within a human body, from which medical diagnostic information is to be taken. Fig. 7 b shows a model of echo signals from the window 72, and consequent multi reflected signals 72 1, 72 2, and 72 3. Fig. 7 c shows a model of echo signals from the region of the surface of a human body 73, and consequent multi reflected signals 73 1,73 2, and 73 3. Fig.7 d shows a combination of signals as shown in Figs. 7 a , 7 b , and 7 c , which actually appears on a display. From the above explanation, it will be evident that multi reflection can cause misinterpretation or incorrect presentation of diagnostic information on a display.

According to the present invention there is provided an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus having an electro sound transducer comprising a piezo electric element which transduces electric pulse signals into ultrasonic sound waves and vice versa, wherein the transducer comprises a front face forming an acoustic matching surface which is composed of a plurality of surface portions of two different kinds provided respectively by parts of the piezo electric element and parts of an acoustic medium, which are uniformly mixed over the surface, the relationship between total areas and substantive acoustic reflection factors of the two kinds of surface portions making up the front acoustic matching surface being substantially In order to reduce multi reflection, the present invention provides for the avoidance of reflection at a surface of a transducer element. If a reflected sound wave is avoided or eliminated at the surface of the transducer element multi reflection will not occur. Embodiments of the present invention apply an acoustic matching surface to a piezo electric device. Multi reflection is avoided by dividing the piezo electric device surface to divided faces having different reflection factors and areas so that the phases of sound waves reflected by the divided faces are opposite so that the reflected waves cancel.

Embodiments of the present invention avoid multi reflection by using an acoustic phase technique , and can be applied not only to an array transducer but also to a single transducer element. The acoustic phase technique of the present invention is an acoustic matching surface technique. Fig.8 illustrates the structure of an electro sound transducer. In Fig.8, a transducer element 800 consists of a piezo electric device 801, an acoustic matching layer 802, and an acoustic damper 803. Generally, device 801 has a front face and a back face. Sound waves are radiated from and received at the front face. Layer 802 is attached to the front face of device 801, and a front face of layer 802 is directly contacted to a target 30. Damper 803 is attached to the back face of device 801 to absorb backward radiated sound waves. Thickness of layer 802 is nearly approximately a quarter of the wavelength of sound waves emitted by 801. Layer 802 is usually provided for impedance matching so that sound waves are effectively radiated into target 30 in a short pulse period. More detail is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. tokukosho 55 33020. In the previous transducer element 800, sound waves radiated forward are reflected at the boundary faces such as a front face of layer 802 a target surface 31 and a boundary 32 between different media tissues in the target. The reflected sound waves are reflected again by the front face of device 801 causing multi reflection front multi reflection . On the other hand, a part of the reflected sound waves passes through element 801, and reflected by the back face of device 801 causing another multi reflection back multi reflection . This is due to mismatching of the impedance of layer 802 and damper 803 to device 801. To avoid front multi reflection, layer 802 is modified so that the acoustic impedances looking into the layer from its two main surfaces are equal to the impedances of the media attached to those respective surfaces, and internal impedance of the layer is varied linearly from one end to the other. This is explained in more detail in Japanese Patent Publication No. tokukuoshoo 58 18095. Fig.9 illustrates phase relationship between incident and reflected sound waves at the boundary faces of acoustic media. In the Figure, 901, 902, and 930 are acoustic media which have acoustic impedances Z10, Z20, and Z30 respectively. 9281 is an incident sound wave arriving at the faces of medium 901 and medium 902 through medium 930. 9282 is a sound wave reflected by the face of medium 901, and 9283 is a sound wave reflected by the face of medium 902. For medium 901 , the reflection factor R13 looking from medium 930 towards medium 901 is From this equation , R13 0, if Z10 Z30. This means that a reflected sound wave 9282 has the same phase as an incident sound wave 9821. On the other hand, R13 0 if Z10 Z30. This means that a reflected sound wave 9282 has a phase the reverse of an incident sound wave 9821. For medium 902, the reflection factor R23 looking from medium 930 towards medium 902 is From above equations 6 and 7 , it can be seen that it is possible to make reflected sound waves 9282 and 9283 cancel each other out under the following conditions More generally, the following equation can be obtained to describe conditions for cancellation of reflected sound waves 901 is a piezo electric device device 902 is some medium which satisfies a specific condition which will be described below with respect to equation 9 930 is common target for 901 and 902 such as water or a human body common target the faces of 901 and 902 are arranged on one plane facing 930 the face of device 901 is divided into a plurality of divided faces which will be called a device group hereinafter the face of medium 902 is divided into a plurality of divided faces which will be called a medium group hereinafter and the divided faces of device and medium are uniformly mixed the relationship between areas and reflection factors given in equation 8 can be generalized to In the above generalization, it has been assumed that the device and the medium are each made of a single material respectively. However, cases in which each individual device and medium are made of different kinds of materials can be considered. The present invention encompasses such cases. For such a case equation 9 can be applied, except that the reflection factors must be extended or generalized as substantial combination reflection factors applicable to the device and the medium respectively. Fig.10 illustrates an embodiment of the present invention utilizing the acoustic matching surfce technique. A is a front view of a transducer, and B is a sectional view of the transducer 9291 along line 9290 in A . In Figs. 10 A and B , 9011 is a piezo electric device, 9021 is an acoustic medium, 9031 is an acoustic damper, 9051 is coating material, and L1 is the thickness of device 9011 along the direction of incident sound waves. In the embodiment of the present invention of Fig.10, device 9011 has a number of holes distributed uniformly over the face of device 9011, and medium 9021 fills these holes. Coating 9051 coats the front face of device 9011, the front face of coating 9051 contacts a target to be diagnosed, and damper 9031 is attached to the back face of device 9011. Reflected sound waves at the front face of element 9291 can be cancelled and multi reflection can be avoided, when acoustic impedance and surface area of each material satisfy the following equation S11 total area of the front face of device 9011 except S12, S12 total area of the holes at the front face of device 9011, Fig. 11 shows a sectional side view of a transducer 9301 which is a modifiction of transducer 9291 of Fig.10 such that reflected waves at the back face of the piezo electric device can also be cancelled. 9301 is a transducer element, 9012 is a piezo electric device having a number of holes distributed uniformly over its face, 9022 is an acoustic medium which fills these holes, 9052 is a coating material, 9032 is an acoustic damper for device 9012, 9033 is an acoustic damper for medium 9022, and L2 and L3 are the thicknesses of device 9012 and medium 9022 respectively along the direction of incident sound waves. Avoidance of back multi reflection of element 9301 can be achieved by following structure D damper 9032 is attached to the back face of device 9012, M damper 9033 is attached to the back face of medium 9022, thickness L2 of device 9012 along the direction of incident sound waves is equal to a half wavelength in device 9012, and thickness L3 of medium 9022 along the direction of incident sound waves is equal to a half wavelength in device 9022. Wavelengths in the above media are different, because sound velocity depends on the acoustic characters of the media. Here, wavelength in device 9012 is longer than wavelength in medium 9022, therefore L2 is longer than L3. Backward multi reflection in device 9301 can be avoided when the following equation is satisfied S21 total area of the back face of device 9012 except S22 S22 total area of the holes at the back face of device 9012 which is equal to total area of the back face of medium 9022 Forward multi reflection of element 9301 can be avoided in the same way as described for Fig.10. Therefore, this modified transducer element 9301 can avoid both front and back multi reflection. For back multi reflection avoidance as described above, if we assume that front and back faces of a piezo electric device device are divided into divided faces with insertion of acoustic medium medium in the device, extending along the direction of sound propagation, with medium parts distributed uniformly over both faces and a face of an acoustic damper damper attached to the back face of device and to the medium described above is also divided into divided faces for device and for medium, equation 1 can be generalized to Sa total area of damper s divided faces contacted to the device Rc substantial reflection factor of the damper contacted to the device Sb total area of damper s divided faces contacted to the medium and Rd substantial reflection factor of damper attached to the medium. In the above generalization, it has been assumed that, the device and medium are each made of a single material respectively. However,cases in which each individual device and medium are made of different kinds of material can be considered. The present invention encompasses such cases. For such a case the equation 12 can be applied, except that the reflection factors must be extended or generalized as substantial combination reflection factors of the device and the medium respectively. Fig.12 illustrates a transducer element 9311 in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. A shows a front view of element 9311, and B shows a sectional view taken along line 9310 in A . 9013 is a piezo electric device, 9023 is acoustic medium which is glued on the front face of element 9311 being distributed uniformly in the fashion of the holes in Fig.10, 9053 is an acoustic coating which coats the front face of device 9013 and medium 9023, 9034 is an acoustic damper attached to the back face of device 9013, and Forward multi reflection of element 9311 can be avoided if the following equation is satisfied S31 total area of the frontface of device 9012 except S32 S32 total area of medium 9023 looking backwards from the front face of element 9311 Embodiments mentioned above relate to the avoidance of acoustic multi reflection at the front and back faces of the piezo electric device. However, similar means can be applied not only to the piezo electric device but also to the acoustic coating or the acoustic damper independently in accordance with the invention. Fig.13 illustrates another electro sound transducer embodying the invention. 9321 is an array transducer consisting of a piezo electric device 9014 and acoustic medium 9024. Forward multi reflection can be avoided by providing impedance and area of device 9014 and medium 9024 so as to satisfy an equation similar to equation 10 . In an array transducer, generally, individual piezo electric devices therein are arranged with gaps between them. Therefore, transducer 9321 can be fabricated simply by filling the gaps with acoustic medium 9024.
