# Coloured bleaching compositions.

## Abstract
Aqueous bleaching compositions can be satisfactorily coloured by inclusion therein of a coloured polymer latex which consists of a copolymer of a hydrophobic monomer with a reactive copolymerisable monomer containing a chromophore. These coloured polymer latices are particu larly suitable for colouring hypochlorite containing bleach ing compositions.
