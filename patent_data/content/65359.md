## Description
SELF SEALING STRETCH WRAP FILM AND FILM FORMING COMPOSITION This invention relates to an extrudable composition capable of forming a stretch wrap film, the composition comprised of a high pressure, low density HP LD ethylene polymer, a low pressure, low density LP LD hydrocarbon interpolymer, and a liquid polybutene. Thermoplastic stretch wrap films are well known. They are used for the over wrap packaging of goods, e.g., for wrapping food for refrigeration and for unitizing pallet loads. There are a variety of overwrapping techniques which are employed utilizing such stretch wrap films. According to such overwrapping techniques, a package load is overwrapped by a single or multilayer band of stretchable film that is held in tension around the package load but not heat shrunk to it. A description of one such stretch wrap film overwrapping technique is found inU.S. A 4,050,221 to P.R. Lancaster et al. Prior art stretch wrap films have included film materials such as polyvinyl chloride PVC HP LD polyethylene PE homopolymer resins HP ethylene vinyl acetate EVA copolymer resins LP LD ethylene butene l copolymers and co extruded laminate compositions comprised of one or more of the following materials HP LD PE homopolymer resins HP EVA copolymer resins and LP LD ethylene interpolymers. Four important physical properties of a good stretch wrap film are its puncture resistance, its elongational characteristics, its Elmendorf tear resistance, and its self sealability at low temperatures. Resistance to puncture is important because during overwrapping techniques, the stretch wrap film contacts sharp edges or protrusions on the pallet load. Puncture resistance is a function of the capacity of such stretch wrap film to elongate biaxially. Resistance to tearing is important because during overwrapping techniques or during subsequent handling of the wrapped pallet, if an edge of the stretch wrap film is nicked, abraded, punctured, or in any way weakened, premature tearing of the film will occur. Self sealability refers to the film s ability to cling to itself without the application of special adhesives or heat. This same phenomenon is also referred to as blocking.Since the stretch wrap films are used at temperatures between 17 C and 60 C, it is important for the film, once sealed, to retain the integrity of such seal throughout this temperature range. Although the prior art stretch wrap films identified hereinabove have met some of the aforementioned requirements, they still have various disadvantages. PVC, HP LD PE homopolymer resins, HP EVA resins, HP LD ethylene lower alkyl acrylate copolymers, and LP LD ethylene butene l copolymer resins have either 1 poor resistance. to notched tear in the machine or transl verse direction of the film, or 2 poor resistance to puncture.For example, HP EVA resins containing between 6 and 15 VA possess excellent puncture resistance, but have very poor Elmendorf tear resistance, particularly in the transverse film direction.HP EVA resins containing less than 6 VA and HP LDPE homopolymer resins provide good Elmendorf tear resistance, but poor puncture resistance. Coextruded prior art laminate films may have excellent puncture resistance, Elmendorf tear resistance and self sealability at low temperatures, but the formation of such films requires the use of specialized and costly multi layer processing equipment. The use of partial carboxylic acid esters of polyols have been described in U.S. A 3,932,563 as providing self sealability properties in a stretch wrap film produced from a composition containing a HP EVA type resin, the aforementioned polyol ester, and a hydrocarbon resin such as a polyterpene resin or hydrogenated polycyclopentadiene resin alone or in conjunction with polybutylene polyisobutylene. However, it has been found that these cling agents, i.e., the carboxylic acid esters of polyols, do not provide stretch wrap films with good self seala bility at 15 C. It is known that liquid polybutenes of low molecular weight provide good self sealability at about 15iC. Increasing the concentration of cling agent can improve low temp erature self sealability, but results in excessive lzleed out of the cling agent at the higher temperature. By bleed out is meant the migration or diffusion of the cling agent to the stretch wrap film surface air interface. The present invention seeks to provide an extrudable composition for forming, via a tubular blown or slot cast film extrusion process, an improved stretch wrap film. This invention also seeks to provide an extrudable composition for forming a stretch wrap film having good puncture and Elmendorf tear resistance and which is self sealable at low temperatures. This invention further seeks to provide an extrudable composition and stretch wrap film formed therefrom which composition is comprised of the polymers herein defined. This invention additionally seeks to decrease the extensional viscosity of a HP Lb ethylene polymer stretch wrap film by the addition thereof of a LP LD hydrocarbon interpolymer. This invention still further seeks to provide an extrudable film forming composition containing a liquid polybutene which provides self sealability at a temperature between 15 C and 60 C without excessive bleeding out of the liquid polybutene at the air polymer interface of a stretch wrap film formed from the composition. An extrudable composition has been found which forms a stretch wrap film having the property of being essentially pinhole free at a thickness between 12.7 and 25.4 sm. The stretch wrap film has good puncture and Elmendorf tear resistance, and is self sealable at temperatures between 150C and 6O C. The extrudable composition comprises 1 more than 60 , preferably more than 68 , and less than 80 , preferably less than 75 by weight of a HP LD ethylene polymer 2 more than 20 , preferably more than 25 , and less than 40 , preferably less than 32 by weight of a LP LD hydrocarbon interpolymer and. 3 more than 0.8 , preferably more than 1 , and less than 5 , preferably less than 3 by weight of a liquid polybutene having a number average molecular weight below 3500 Daltons. HP LD Ethylene Polymer HP LD ethylene polymer refers to an ethylene polymer, such as polyethylene, which has an annealed density up to about 0.935 gram cm3 and preferably, from 0.915 to 0.925 gram cm3. The HP LD polythylene is made commercially by the well known high pressure process, utilizing free radical initiators. In such a process, ethylene is homopolymerized with free radical catalysts under pressures greater than 103 MPa and up to 345 MPa at temperatures up to 3000C in tubular or stirred reactors in the absence of solvents. Also useful, and within the scope of the present invention are copolymers of ethylene with a vinyl or hydrocarbyl substituted vinyl ester of a C1 C30 monocarboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid is preferably aliphatic, saturated and monocarboxylic, e.g., vinyl propionate, vinyl hexoate, vinyl octaoate, vinyl dodecanate, vinyl behenate, or isopropyl acetate. The preferred ester is vinyl acetate in a concentration of 2 12 by weight in the copolymer. Also within the scope of the present invention are copolymers of ethylene with alkyl esters of acrylic methacrylic acids such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, and ethyl methacrylate. Other alpha olefins also may be present in the above copolymers in minor concentrations.The aforementioned copolymers have a density between 0.915 to 0.935 grams cm3. LP LD Hydrocarbon Interpolymer Suitable LP LD hydrocarbon interpolymers for the film forming compositions of the present invention include copolymers of ethylene or butene l and one or more C3 to C1O alpha olefins. These copolymers have a density of 0.910 to 0.940 grams cm3 and preferably of from O.915 to 0.928 grams cm3 These copolymers can be made in a solution, slurry or gas phase process which is well known to those skilled in the art. The LP LD hydrocarbon interpolymers used for the compositions of this invention should have a standard melt index from 0.1 to 10 decigrams per minute and preferably from 0.5 to 3.0 decigrams per minute. The extrudable LP LD hydrocarbon interpolymers employed in the extrudable compositions of the present invention are normally solid materials, that is, solid at room temperature. Any extrusion grade LP LD hydrocarbon interpolymer can be used in the compdsitions of the present invention. The term LP LD hydrocarbon intir polymer thus includes interpolymers of one or more olefin s with each other0 and or up to about 30 weight percent of one or more monomer s which is copolymerizable with such olefin s .

Other additives may include colorants. Preparation of Stretch Wrap Film Forming Compositions The stretch wrap film forming compositions can be prepared by several methods which are well known to those skilled in the art. In one method, the components are dry blended together in a roll drum for 20 minutes at room temperature. In another method, the components are compounded utilizing a Banbury batch mixer coupled to a Farrel Birmingham single screw extruder melt pump. The components are mixed in the Banbury mixer for from 4 to 5 minutes, dropped at a temperature from 125 C to 1350C and extruded through an extruder melt pumm using a throat temperature of 140 C, a barrel temperature of 150it and a die temperature of 175 C. Extrusion of Stretch Wrap Film The stretch wrap film forming compositions described herein may be extruded by either a tubular blown film or a slot cast film extrusion process. Details of these processes are well known to those skilled in the art. In the tubular blown film process, the film forming composition is first melted and then extruded through an annular die. The die has a die gap greater than 0.381 mm and less than 1.27 mm, and preferably greater than 0.508 mm and less than889 mm. The polymer film forming composition is extruded at a melt temperature between 1630C and 2180C. The polymer film forming composition is extruded in an upward vertical direction in the form of either a bubble or a tube although it also can be extruded either downwardly or horizontally. The tubular extrudate is expanded to the desired dimensions and then cooled by one of several conventional techniques which are well known in the art, e.g., forced air, mandril, and water quench.The tubular film, or bubble, is then flattened by passing the film through a collapsing frame and a set of nip rolls. The nip rolls are driven, thereby providing a means of drawing the tubular film or bubble away from the annular die. A positive pressure of a gas, such as air or nitrogen, is maintained inside the tubular bubble. As is known in the operation of conventional blown film processes, the presence of the gas is controlled to impart the desired dimensional orientation to the film tube or bubble. The degree of tubular bubble expansion may be measured as the ratio of the expanded bubble circumference to the circumference of the die annuls. This ratio is generally in the range of 1 1 to 6 1 and preferably from 1.5 1 to 3.0 1. In the slot cast film process, the film forming composition is first melted and then extruded through a rectangulat orifice die. The polymer film forming composition is extruded at a melt temperature between 2000C and 3150C. The molten polymer extrudate is in the form of a sheet and is extruded in a downward vertical direction. After exiting the die, the molten polymer extrudate comes in close proximity to, and sometimes contacts, a water cooled chill roll and is solidified. A secondary set of rollers provides a means of withdrawing the molten polymer extrudate sheet from the die and under the primary chill roll. Extrusion processes, in general, impart a biaxial orientation to a thermoplastic film. The term machine direction, as applied to describing the orientation of thermoplastic films, refers to the film axis which is parallel to the direction in which the polymer extrudate exits the die. The term transverse direction refers to the film axis which is perpendicular, and in the plane of the film, to the machine direction. The drawdown characteristics of the stretch wrap film forming composition described herein are excellent. The presence of the LP LD hydrocarbon interpolymer lowers extensional viscosity. Very thin gauge films can be produced, essentially free of pinholeis, from these stretch wrap film forming compositions even when the film forming composition is significantly contaminated with foreign particles and or gels. The films produced from these stretch wrap film forming compositions are usually prepared in sheets which are from .2.5 Fm to 125 jim thick, and preferably from 12.5 pm to 100 pm in thickness. Physical Properties of the Stretch Wrap Film As hereinbefore noted, the physical properties which are particularly significant for the successful use of thermo plastic films in stretch wrap applications include their Instron puncture resistance and their Elmendorf tear resistance. With respect to the latter, the transverse direction Elmendorf tear resistance is particularly important. A film which possesses excellent transverse direction Elmendorf tear resistance will, in p,eneral, not fail during the stretch wrapping operation even though it may become punctured during the operation. The thermoplastic stretch wrap films of this invention have self sealability, or cling. At the end of a stretch wrapping cycle, the trailing edge of film unitizing the goods must be fastened to the package to prevent unraveling of the film and subsequent deunitization of the packaged goods. Methods commonly practiced in the art to fasten this trailing edge include the use of heat sealing, use of an adhesive, or mechanical means such as staples, or, the use of thermoplastic stretch wrap films which possess the property of self sealability.The latter method is preferred for reasons of ease and convenience, material economics, and labor savings. The stretch wrap films of this invention retain excellent self sealability properties as well as maintain the integrity of the seal, throughout the distribution cycle of the package, at temperatures in the range of from 150C to 6O0C. The thermoplastic stretch wrap films of this invention have a machine direction Elmendorf tear resistance of greater than about 3.2.kg mm, preferably greater than about 4.7 kg mm, and most preferably greater than about 5.8.kg mm a transverse directionElmendorf tear resistance of greater than about 7.9 kg mm, preferably greater than about 8.9 kg mm. and most preferably greater than about 10.8 kglmm and an Instron puncture resistance of greater than about 59 J mm, and preferably greater than about 66 J mm. The following example is illustrative of the present invention and is not intended as a limitation of the scope thereof. Example Preparation of Polymer Resins Two low pressure, low density ethylene butene l copolymers were prepared according to the procedure disclosed in South African Patent Publication No. 79 01365, publishedSeptember 22, 1980, entitled Process for Making Film From LowDensity Ethylene Hydrocarbon Copolymer by W.A. Fraser et al.The properties of the ethylene butene l copolymers were determined by the following methods Density was determined according to ASTM D 1505. A plaque was conditioned for one hour at 100 C to approach equilibrium crystallinity. Density is reported as gms cm3. Melt Index MT was determined according to ASTMD 1238, Condition E. It was measured at 190 C and 303kPa and reported as grams 10 minutes. Flow Index HLMI was measured according to ASTM D 1238, Condition F. It was measured at 3030kPa and reported as grams per 10 minutes. Melt Flow Ratio MFR was calculated as Flow Index Melt Index. Puncture Resistance Instron was measured according to the following procedure. A film of measured thickness is supported on a 8.26 cm diameter ring which, in turn, is mounted on an Instron tensile testing machine. A blunt ended plunger having a 1.91 cm diameter, hemispherical head is pressed through the ring of supported film at a rate of 50.8 cm min. The energy required to deform the film to rupture is normalized by film thickness and reported as ,J mm Elmendorf Tear Strength was measured according toASTM D 1922 67. This is a notched tear test. A 6.4 cm x 8.9 cm film specimen is subjected to a pant leg type tear. This is a pendulum impulse type test. It measures the force required to propagate a tear. The tear strength is measured in grams. The data presented herein have been normalized by film thickness and reported as kg mm. Elongation was measured according to ASTM D 882. Film strips, 2.54 cm x 12.7 cm are clamped at a 5.1 cm gauge length and deformed at a jaw separation rate of 50.8 cmlmin. Elongation at break is measured by following the deformation of 2.54 cm gauge marks placed on the film sample and is reported in percent. Cling was measured according to the following procedureThe device designed to measure cling is used on the Instron.It consists of a 0.6 cm thick metal plate on which is secured a sample of the film to be tested, a clamp which holds one end of a 2.54 cm wide film specimen, a string which connects the clamp at one end and a 100 gram weight at the other, a metal or glass rod over which the string slides, and a ringstand to hold the rod parallel to the Instron crosshead. The 2.54 cm wide by 22.9 cm long film sample is prepared by placing the wrap between two pieces of paper and cutting on a paper cutter. 20.3 cm of the 22.9 cm inch long sample is placed on the plate being evaluated. The film is firmly rolled flatonto the plate with a rubber roller. The additional 2.54 cm of the sample is clamped in the small steel clamp. The plate covered with the larger film sample is mounted horizontally on theInstron crosshead. A glass or metal rod is held parallel to the plate edge and to the crosshead, 12.7 cm from the edge of the plate. The string attached to the clamp holding the sample is hung over the rod. A 100g mass is attached to the end of the string. In this position, the mass is exerting force which tries to slide the film over the plate. Generally, the coefficient of friction is so great that the film will not slide. The plate and crosshead are raised 6.4 cm above the rod.Next, the crosshead is lowered at a rate of 50.8 cm minute. As the plate drops below the level of the rod, the film begins to peel from the plate. When the film releases completely from the plate, the crosshead is stopped. The distance the plate dropped below the rod in centimeters is related to the magnitude of adhesive force or cling between the film and the plate. One of the ethylene butene l copolymers, designatedA, had the following properties a melt index of 2.0 a MFR of 28 and a density of 0.918 gm cm3. The second ethylene butene l copolymer, designated B, had the following properties a melt index of 3.0 a MFR of 28 and a density of 0.921 gm cm3. Two high pressure, low density polymers made by the well known high pressure tubular reactor process were used.The density, melt index MI , flow index HLMI and melt flow ratio MFR were measured using the same methods which were used in determining these properties for the previously mentioned low pressure, low density ethylene butene l copolymer. One of the high pressure, low density polymers4 designated X, had the following properties a melt indexof 0.9 a MFR of 66 a density of about .932 gm ccm, and it contained about 4.5 weight percent of vinyl acetate. The other high pressure, low density polymer, designated Y, had the following properties a melt index of 2.0, a MFR of 47, a density of about .929 gm cm, and it contained about 6.0 weight per cent of vinyl acetate.

Runs with compositions 5 through 11 illustrate the extrudable compositions of the invention including the cling agent. As can be seen from the results, the addition of the cling agent does not adversely affect rhe physical properties of the film but does add the cling property to the film. Runs with compositions 12 21 were comparison examples run outside of the scope of the invention and were used as controls during this study. Compositions 1 11, which are included in the scope of the invention, are easily extrudable under normal blown film extrusion condotions. The control compositions containing concentrations of LP LD ethylene butene l copolymer lower than that included within the range of this invention, i.e., 20 runs with compositions 16 17, 18 are equally extrudable compared to compositions included within the scope of the invention but exhibit inferior physical properties. Control compositions having concentrations of LP LD ethylene butene l copolymer higher than those included within the scope of this invention runs with compositions 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21 show superior physical properties but are not easily extrudable under normal conditions.
