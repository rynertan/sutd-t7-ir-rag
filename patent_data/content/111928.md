## Description
CATALYSIS OF CONDENSATION REACTIONS TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to organic condensation reactions effected in the presence of novel pyrophosphate and hydrogen phosphate catalysts and is more particularly concerned with the production of amine compounds in enhanced yields. BACKGROUND OF THE PRIOR ART Organic synthesis by condensation reactions result ing in the loss of a molecule of water or of ammonia are well known in the art. Certain of such reactions are generally effected in the presence of acidic catalysts. An important area in which such acid catalysis has been employed is in cyclization reactions as in the synthesis of triethylenediamine and its C substituted homologues. The catalysts more generally used or proposed for use in such cyclization reactions are solid products of the Lewis acid type. Triethylenediamine, also called diazabicyclo 2.2.2 octane, has been widely employed commercially as a catalyst in organic isocyanate reactions with compounds containing labile hydrogen, as in the produc tion of urethane polymers. Triethylenediamine sometimes hereinafter referred to as TEDA was initially prepared in significant quantities by methods such as that described in U.S. Patent No. 2,937,176, by passing aliphatic amines in vapor phase over acidic cracking catalyst, such as silica alumina dried gel or acidactivated clays. Numerous other feed stocks as well as other catalysts are disclosed in subsequent patents for preparation of TEDA as well as C alkyl derivatives thereof. Typical among these are U.S. Patents 2,985,658 and 3,166,558 employing preferably silica alumina type catalyst, but listing also other useful solid acid catalysts that can be employed such as alumina in which phosphate or fluoride ion is incorporated U.S. 2,985,658 . It is disclosed in U.S. 3g1168558 that while these reactions can take place under superatmospheric pressures, they offer no advantage over atmospheric or subatmospheric pressures. Among other catalysts proposed in the patent art for preparation of triethylene di amine and or C alkyl homologues Thereof, are certain phosphate compounds, particularly aluminum phosphate. The use of aluminum phosphate as a catalyst in the preparation of heterocyclic compounds from aliphatic amines was early disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,467,205, particularly for the preparation of piperazine from ethylenediamine or from polyethylene polyamine. The use of aluminum phosphate as catalyst in the preparation of triethylenediamine accompanied by piperazine among other by products is further described in U.S. Patent 3,172,891 while U.S. Patent 3,342,820 describes the use of complex phosphates of alkali metal and trivalent metals in the preparation of C alkyl TEDA. U.S.S.R. In ventoris Certificate No. 525g681 discloses that the known processes for the preparation of TEDA by the catalytic conversion of various amines use aluminosilicate cracking catalysts, alumina with different additives, tungsten oxide or phosphates of metals at temperatures of 2200C to 5500C, under pressures of 0,1 to 150 atm. absolute , in the presence of various diluents. U.S. Patent 3,297,701 discloses as catalysts for preparation of TEDA and C alkyl TEDA, in addition to the preferred aluminum phosphate stated to be superior, other phosphate compounds including calcium and iron phosphates among other listed metal phosphates. In the conversion of N aminoethylpiperazine to triethylenediamine over aluminum phosphate catalyst, at most up to 39 mol triethylenediamine is said to be obtained.Other of the named metal phosphate catalysts in the examples of the patent obtain yields of less than 10 mol TEDA. Acid metal phosphate catalysts, particularly phosphates of boron, aluminum and trivalent iron, have also been proposed for use in intramolecular cyclic dehydration reactions and other condensation reactions involving amino compounds. Examples of such reactions are found in U.S. Patent 4,117,227, which discloses conversion of an N substituted diethanolamine to the corresponding N substituted morpholine.These condensation reactions are carried out in liquid phase at a temperature of from about 1900C to about 2600C and at any pressure to maintain reactants in a liquid state, i.e.generally from about 10 to about 1000 psig.U.S. Patent 4,036,881 describes preparation of non cyclic polyalkylene polyamines by condensation of an alkylene diamine with an ethanolamine. N hydroxethylmorpholine is condensed with morpholine in the presence of aluminum phosphate catalyst attemperatures from about 2400 to 3000C and pressures of about 200 to 500 psig to form dimorpholino ethane according to U.S Patent 4,103,087. Similarly, dimorpholinodiethyl ether is obtained by condensation of hydroxyethyl morpholine with aminoethyl morpholine over iron, aluminum or boron phosphate in U.S. Patent 4,095,022. Reaction of piperazine with ethanolamine over such acidic metal phosphate at a temperature of from about 2500 to about 3500C and a pressure ranging from about 200 psig to about 500 psig produces N aminoethyl piperazine according to U.S. Patent 4,049,657. U.K. Patent 1,492,359 discloses the preparation of morpholine compounds by reacting an aminoalkoxyalkanol compound over phosphoric acid and similar types of phosphorus containing substances. Pyrophosphates of lithium, sodium, strontium and barium have been used as dehydration catalysts seeU.S. Patent 3,957,900. Phosphates and pyrophosphates of strontium and nickel have been used for the dehydrogenation of, for example, n butene to butadiene under the conditions described in U.S. Patent 3,541,172.It is also known to manufacture amines from ammonia and an alcohol over alumina, silica alumina, silica, titania, tungstic OXides, clays or various metal phosphates of the typ referred to above at ammonia to alcohol mole ratios of from 2 1 to 6 1 depending on the ratio of amines desired, temperatures in the range of 3000C to 5000C pressures of 790 to 3550 kilopascals 100 500 psig , and a gas hourly space velocity of 500 to 1500 mol mol see Kirk othmerEncyclopedia of Chemical Technology,third Edition, Vol. 2 1978 , page 276. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that high yields of organic compounds are selectively obtained when the condensation reaction thereof is carried out in the presence of catalytic amounts of a catalyst selected from the group consisting of the pyrophosphate, monohydrogen phosphate and dihydrogen phosphate of strontium, copper, magnesium, calcium, barium, zinc, aluminum, lanthanum, cobalt, nickel, cerium, neodymium, and mixtures thereof. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The monohydrogen and dihydrogen phosphate catalysts of the present invention are prepared by reaction of a mono or diphosphate of an alkali metal or ammonium with a soluble salt of strontium, copper, magnesium, calcium, barium, zinc, aluminum, lanthanum, cobalt, nickel, cerium or neodymium at ambient temperatures.The highest purity and best yields of the present invention are obtained when using the soluble metal salts of a strong acid such as the metal nitrates, in substantially stoichiometric proportion to the phosphate.In aqueous media under these conditions, the reaction mixture is at a pH of about 3.5 to 6.5. In general, to obtain a precipitate of desired high content of the metal monohydrogen or dihydrogen phosphate, the ratio of phosphate to metal salt in the reaction mixture should be such as to have a pH of 5 i 3, or the mixture should be adjusted to that pH range. The pyrophosphate form of the catalysts of the present invention are prepared by heat treating the metal monohydrogen Qr hydrogen phosphate product at temperatures above about 3000C up to 7500C in the presence of a mixture of steam and air, preferably at least about 20 by volume of steam. For use as a catalyst, the metal pyro , monohydrogen or dihydrogen phosphate product may be employed in the form of irregular particles of the desired size range prepared by breaking up the washed and dried filter cake or in the form of regular shaped pellets obtained by known methods of casting or extruding or the product may be deposited or otherwise impregnated into the pores of a microporous substrate suck as alumina, silica, silica alumina, and the like. In using the catalyst of the present invention to catalyze organic condensation reactions, substantially the same conditions may be employed as when using the known catalysts for the particular synthesis. For optimum results, however, some adjustment in temperature, diluent and or space rate may be found beneficial. Some specific examples of the type of organic compounds selectively obtained by the method of this invention include TEDA, the aliphatic alkylamines such as methylamine, methylethylamine, dimethylethylamine, morpholine, and dimethylaminoethylmorpholine. In the production of these compounds, the temperature is in the range of about 285 to 4200C, the pressure is in the range ofabove 1,5 and up to 150 atmospheres, and the liquid hourly space velocity EHSV of the organic feed stock per volume of catalyst is in the range of about 0.05 to 1.5.Preferably depending on the particular reaction, the temperature is in the range of about 3000 to 4000C, the pressure is in the range of about 3 to 10 atmospheres and the LHSV is in the range of about 0.1 to 0.3 to obtain the highest yields and most economical process. The operable ratio of the organic feeds to water diluent is about 10 to 90 on a weight basis and preferably, 20 to 80 by weight. The optimum yield of these compounds is likely to be obtained using the highest temperature in the preferred range at the lowest LHSV. In the preparation of TEDA, the preferred catalyst is selected from the group consisting of monohydrogen phosphate of calcium, magnesium, zinc, mixtures of strontium and barium in the ratio of Sr to Ba of about 1 to 5 to 5 to 1 and mixtures of lanthanum and strontium in the ratio of La to Sr of about 15 to 1 to 15. The organic feed stock used in this reaction to produce TEDA is a substituted piperazine compound selected from the group consisting of hydroxyethylpiperazine and aminoethylpiperazine. The catalysts of this invention are relatively uneffected by the purity of the feed stock. For example, high conversion and good yields can be obtained from crude hydroxyethylpiperazine which contains minor quantities of piperazine and bis hydroxyethylpiperazine. In the preparation of dimethylaminoethylmorpholine DMAEM , The preferred catalyst is a mixture of strontium and nickel monohydrogen phosphate in the ratio of Sr toNi of about 1 to 5 to 5 to 1. The feed stock is morpholine and dimethylethanolamine in the molar ratio in the range of about 1 to 3 and 3 to 1. Preferably, the reaction takes place in the presence of hydrogen in the molar ratio of hydrogen to organic feed of about 1 to 1 to 20 to 1 and an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon or helium in the molar ratio of inert gas to organic feed of about 1 to 1 to 20 to 1. In the preparation of morpholine compounds, e.g.morpholine and alkyl morpholine, wherein the alkyl group has from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, diglycolamine compounds , e.g. diglycolamine and alkyl diglycolamines, wherein the alkyl group has from 1 to 6 carbon atoms are preferably carried out in the presence of strontium monohydrogen phosphate at about 300 to 3700C with the other conditions remaining the same as that discussed above. This reaction also preferably takes place in the presence of the inert gas in ratios of 2 to 1 to 10 to 1 inert gas to liquid organic feed stock. The methods and catalysts of this invention are also capable cf reacting an alcohol and a nitrogencontaining compound selected from the group consisting of ammonia, aliphatic primary and secondary amines, and aromatic primal and secondary amines to selectively convert this ccmpound to the corresponding symmetrical or unsymmetrical higher molecular weight amine with little, if any, conversion to the corresponding by products of thermodynamic amine equilibration. The amines and alcohol in the feed stock each contain 1 to 20 carbons per molecule.Preferably, the catalyst is lanthanum or copper monohydrogen phosphate and the molar ratio of alcohol to nitrogen containing compound ranges from about 1 to 6 to 6 to 1. CATALYST PREPARATIONExample 1 200 grams of strontium nitrate Sr NO3 2 was dissolved in distilled water and brought to a total volume of 800 cc with distilled water. To this solutionThere was added 10 cc of 85 phosphoric acid followed by 34.5 cc of 50 sodium hydroxide added rapidly with vigorous stirring. The resultant fine white precipitate was stirred for 10 minutes, vacuum filtered and waterwashed. The obtained filter cake was air dried in a static oven at approximately 1l00C and extruded into 1 8 inch pellets for evaluation. The obtained product had a surface area of 10 15 mê g. By X ray diffraction the principal component was identified as SrHPO4 with minor quantities of Sr5 OH PO4 3 and unreacted Sr NO3 2. Infrared spectroscopy showed a spectrum consistent with SrHPO4. Ref Richard A. Nygurst and Ronald O. Kagel, Infrared spectra of Inorganic Compounds , page 163, 1971 .Example 2 195 grams of barium nitrate Ba NO3 2 and 53 grams of strontium nitrate Sr N03 2 were dissolved in distilled water and diluted to 500 cc. 132 grams of dibasic ammonium phosphate NH4 2HPO4 were dissolved in distilled water and diluted to 500 cc with heat.The three salt solutions were then combined with heat and stirred for about 10 minutes. The combined solution was vacuum filtered and the resulting precipitate was washed with distilled water and air dried overnight in a static oven at approximately 1100C. The filter cake was broken up into small 1 8 to 1 4 inch irregular granules for evaluation. The resulting product had a surface pH of 4 5 as determined by acid base indicators and the ratio of strontium to barium in the product was found to be 1 to 3.5.Example 3 The procedure for preparing the Example 2 was carried out except that 130 grams of Ba NO3 2 and 106 grams of Sr N03 2 were dissolved in distilled water in place of the 195 and 53 grams respectively. The product had a surface pH of 4 5 and a Sr Ba ratio of 2 1 mol mol.The resulting catalyst was in the form of a fine powder and was deposited on an inert, low surface area Alundum silica alumina core using a powder coating step. The step comprised placing the amount of catalyst to be coated into a jar with the Alundum spheres and rotating on a jar mill for several days to cause the catalyst powder to adhere to the spheres. The resulting coated spheres contained 25 of the active catalyst and 75 inert. Example 4 212 grams of Sr N03 2 were dissolved in distilled water and diluted to 500 cc. 115 grams of ammonium hydrogen phosphate NH4HSPO4 were dissolved in distilled water and diluted to 500 cc. The remaining steps of the catalyst procedure of Example 2 were carried out. The resulting catalyst was believed to contain less than 5 strontium dihydrogen phosphate Sr 2PO4 2 with the balance being SrHPO4. The surface pH of this catalyst mixture was 4 4.6 in comparison to substantially pure strontium monohydrogen phosphate which has a surface pH of 4.8 5.4. Substantially pure strontium dihydrogen phosphate was found to have a surface pH of 0.2 1.2 see Example 21. The product of this example was deposited on the silica alumina spheres in the same manner as set forth under Example 3.Example 5 The same procedure for preparing the catalyst ofExample 1 was carried out except that 236 grams of calcium nitrate Ca NO3 2. 4H20 and 115 grams of NH4H2PO4 were combined. The resulting dried catalyst particles were coated on the silica alumina spheres in the same manner as that of Example 3. The analysis of the catalyst formed by this procedure indicated that it consisted essentially of calcium monodihydrogen phosphate with a Ca P ratio of 1.009 and a surface pH of 4 6. In contrast, substantially pure calcium monohydrogen phosphate had a surface pH of 5 5.5 see Example 16 below. The presence of a very small amount of calcium dihydrogen phosphate may account for the difference in the surface pH value of this catalyst.Example 6 The catalyst preparation procedure of Example 2 was repeated except that 212 grams of Sr NO3 2 were dissolved in place of the mixed barium and strontium nitrate salts and the resulting strontium monohydrogen phosphate catalyst had a surface pH of 4.8 5.2.

The resulting strontium pyrophosphate Sr2P207 had a crushing strength of 0.47 kg. mm of length and a packed bulk density of 1.01 kg. l.Example 20 The ZnHPO4 catalyst product of Example 14 above was coated on the silica alumina spheres in the manner set forth in Example 3.Example 21 132.5 grams of strontium hydroxide octahydrate Sr OH 2.8H2O were dissolved in a solution of 750 cc. of 85 phosphoric acid and 1500 cc. of distilled water. The resulting solution was slowly evaporated to a total volume of about 900 cc. with the temperature being maintained at 250 to 300C. The solution was cooled to 50C overnight and a white precipitate was recovered by vacuum filtration. The resulting Sr H2P04 2 precipitate was washed with 5 300 cc. portions of anhydrous ethanol and with 2 200 cc. portions of anhydrous ether. The product was dried at room temperature under vacuum for 6 hours. An elemental analysis of the product showed a P Sr mol ratio of 2.04 and the surface pH was found to be 0.2 1.2. The fine powder was pressed into tablets the size of.a typical aspirin tablet and crushed to granules 1 8 to 1 4 inch in size. Example 22 The fine powder ofthe catalyst prepared in accordance with Example 21 was deposited on silica alumina spheres in the manner set forth in Example 3.Example 23 2000 grams of Sr NO3 2 were dissolved in 2000 cc of deionized water and the solution diluted to 4000 cc with deionized water after dissolution of the Sr N03 2 was complete. In another container, 1342.3 grams of Na2HPO4 were dissolved in 2000 cc of deionized water. After solution of the na2BPO4 was complete, the solution was diluted to 4000 cc with deionized water. The pH of this solution was approximately 8.8. Precipitation of SrHPO4 was effected by slowly adding the Na2HPO4 solution to the Sr NO3 2 solution with rapid stirring. The white SrHP04 precipitated rapidly from solution forming a rather thick slurry.This slurry was mixed for one hour, after which time the pH was measured to be about six. The solid SrHPOA was recovered by filtering on an eight frame filter press using cloth filters. It was washed with deionized water. After filtering and washing, the solid was dried in a circulating hot air oven at 256oF for four hours. The yield of SrEPOg was 1680 grams. The solid was wetted and formed into pellets by extrusion through a 3.1 mm die plate and cutting the extrudates to about 1 4 inch in length.After drying the extrudate at 250OF for four hours in a circulating hot air oven, they were heat treated at 6620F for two hours in s 20 steam, 80 air atmosphere.Example 24 106 grams of Sr NO3 2 and 145 grams of Ni NO3 2 6B2 0 were dissolved in distilled water and diluted to 500 cc. 132 grams of NH4 2HP04 were dissolved in distilled water and diluted to 500 cc. the remaining steps of Example 1 were carried out to yield a Sr Ni HPO4 catalyst having a surface pH of 5.4 7.0. USE OF CATALYSTSExamples 25 62 Each of the products prepared in accordance withExamples 1 through 22 and Controls 1 and 3 5 above were evaluated for catalytic performance for the preparation of TEDA with either a feed mixture containing hydroxyethylpiperazine HEP or N aminoethylpiperazine AEP in accordance with the following test procedure a 20 cc approximately 6.2g. of the catalyst was loaded into a 3 4 1 diameter stainless steel reactor. b The reactor was placed in a conventional tube furnace such that the catalyst bed was near the furnace center and therefore could be heated to a constant and uniform temperature. c The catalyst bed temperature was raised to a temperature of 3400 4000C over a period of 15 to 30 minutes while a small flow of gaseous nitrogen was maintained through the reactor to aid in the removal of water vapor. d A feed mixture containing HEP and water such that the organic component made up 60 of the mixture was then allowed to flow through the catalyst bed at a rate of 6.5 7.0 cc hour the nitrogen flow was discontinued. e The catalyst bed temperature indicated in the tables set forth below was maintained during the run and the product samples were collected and analyzed. Analyses were performed using well established gas chromatographic techniques. The yields of TEDA and piperazine PIP as well as the conversion obtained from the catalysts of Examples 1 22 in Table 1 can be compared with those of Control Catalysts 1 and 3 5 in Table 2 below.

The results set forth in Table 1 where the catalysts of the examples demonstrate a unique ability to convert over 50 mol. of the feed to products the majority of which is TEDA. Depending on the particular feed stock, the yield of TEDA ranged from 6 in the worst case using Ni to approximately 84 in the best mode using 1 part SrHPO4 to 3.5 parts BaHP04, see Example 1 above.The former being the use of NiHPO4 with an aminoethylpiperazine feed. When the feed over NiHP04 was changed to hydroxyethylpiperazine, the yield increased 6 fold with a corresponding increase in the conversion from approximately 57 to 82 . The BaHP04 catalysts per se did not meet the criteria for an effective catalyst for the conversion of HEP to TEDA. However, when approximately four parts of this catalyst were combined with one part of SrHPO4 as in the Example 2, the yield ofTEDA and the conversion increased based on a synergistic effect over that of the SrHPO4 catalyst. Example 63 The catalyst of Example 23 was tested in the conversion of crude HEP to TEDA. The reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure, at a liquid hourly space velocity of 0.3 and at the temperatures indicated in Table 3 below. TABLE 3 Initial After 78 Days Bed Temp., OC 360 368 HEP Conversion, wt. 99 99 TEDA Yield, wt. 40.5 43.0 PIP Yield, wt. 13.5 18.5Example 64 The catalyst of Example 23 was tested for the conversion of diethanolamine to TEDA. The test was carried out at 3700C using a feed consisting of diethan olamine and water 2.0 to 1.0 mole ratio pumped into the reactor at a rate of 4.4 liquid cc hr along with helium diluent at a rate of 25 cc minute. The diethanolamine was in completely converted to TEDA, as the only, i.e. about 26 mol. , recovered product.Example 65 A 64 by weight solution of N aminoethyl piperazine in water was passed over a catalyst composition consisting essentially of SrHPO4 at 3800C and at a liquid hourly space velocity of 0.3 volumes of liquid per volume of catalyst. In a first pass operation there was obtained 96.8 mol. conversion of the feed compound, obtaining a yield of 34.8 by weight 40.1 mol. TEDA and 27.1 by weight 40.6 mol. PIP Other typical condensation reactions in whichSrHPO4 may be employed as a catalyst include the formation of amines by amination of the corresponding alcohols with ammonia and the formation of polyamines from glycols and diamines. It is believed that the key to the properties of the SrHPO4 as a highly selective catalyst is due to the presence of a specific structure, which provides a narrow range of acidity. This narrow acidity range displayed by SrHPO4 may be optimum for promoting certain types of acid catalyzed reactions, in contrast to such catalysts as alumina, silica alumina and the like which have acid sites of widely varying strength, and hence show relatively low selectivity for the desired reaction.Example 66 Diethyleneglycol was passed over the SrHPO4 catalyst of Example 23 in the presence of water at a temperature of 3700C and at a contact time of 6.7 seconds. The feed Contained 57 vol. diethyleneglycol and 43 vol H2O. The reaction product contained 33 wt. 1,4 dioxane, corresponding to a yield of 47 mol. . The addition of water to the organic feeds may be desirable to prevent loss of catalyst activity as a result of dehydration of the SrHPO4 to the pyrophosphate.Example 67 The SrHPO4 catalyst of Example 23 was tested for the conversion of 1, 4 butanediol to tetrahydrofuran.The test was carried out at 3500C using a feed consisting of 20 percent by volume of water and 80 percent by volume of 1, 4 butanediol pumped to the tubular reactor at a rate of 4.4 cc hr. Helium dilutent was also fed at the rate of 30 cc min. Under these conditions, the diol was completely converted to tetrahydrofuran.Example 68 The CaHPO4 catalyst of Example 5 was recovered in a fine, powdered state and was deposited on inert alumina spheres instead of the silica alumina spheres in the same manner as set forth under Example 3. 20 cc of the resulting coated alumina contained 2 gms. of CAPO4. The performance of this catalyst was evaluated for the preparation of an alipathic secondary amine with a feed mixture of monoethylamine EA and methanol using the general procedure used in Examples 25 62 for the preparation of TEDA. Specifically, 1 mol. of the primary amine and 1 mol. of the alcohol were reacted at 3500C, 1 atmosphere pressure and an LHSV of 0.15 hr.The conversion was 23.9 mol. of the ME to the secondary aliphatic amine. The yield of methylethylamine MEA was 16.5 mol. of the amine feed with a selectivity of 69 mol. . The only other product in any significant quantity was dimethylethylamine DMEA with yield of 5.4 mol. and a selectivity of 22 mol . Example 69 The procedure of Example 68 was followed except that 1 mol. of diethylamine DEA was substituted for 1 mol. of EA. 27.6 mol. of this primary amine in the feed was converted for the most part to a single secondary amine, i.e. diethylmethylamine DEMA and a trace amount of a tertiary amine, i.e. triethylamine. The yield of DEA fed was 23 mol. DEMA with a selectivity of 83.3 mol. .Examples 70 71 3 grams of the La2 HP04 3 catalyst of Example 9 were coated onto alumina spheres and the procedures ofExample 60 and 69 were followed. The results from these reactions are summarized in Table 4 below.Examples 72 73 The SrHPO4 catalyst of Example 6, was used to convert methanol and either monoethylamine Example 72 or diethylamine Example 73 in the same manner set forth under Example 68. The results of these Examples 72 73 are summarized and compared with the other Examples 68 71 in Table 4 below. TABLE 4 ALIPHATIC AMINE PRODUCTION Amine Yield, mol. Selectivity, Mol.

The data of Table 4 above illustrates the unexpectedly high selectivities to the corresponding aliphatic amine without the formation of the corresponding byproducts of thermodynamic amine equilibration. The relatively low conversion to product of Examples 68 71 can be attributed to the fact that only 2 gms. ofCaHPO4 or 3 gms. La2 HP04 3 were used in Examples 68 71 in comparison to about 20 gms. of SrHPO4 that were used in Examples 72 and 73.Example 74 The CuHPO4 catalyst of Example 13 was coated onto alumina spheres and the procedure of Example 68 was followed except that 1 mol. of ammonia was substituted for 1 mol. of EA. The results from this reaction were a 65 mol. yield of monomethylamine MA based on the methanol, an 87 mol. selectivity to MA and a methanol conversion of 75 mol. .Example 75 The La2 HP04 3 catalyst of Example 9 was deposited on alumina spheres and the procedure of Example 74 was followed. The results were yields based on the methanol in the feed of 13 mol. trimethylamine TMA , 2.8 mol. dimethylamine DMA and 3 mol. monomethylamine MA , selectivities based on the methanol of 69 mol. TMA, 14.9 mol. DMA and 16 mol. MA, and a methanol conversion of 52 mol. . It has also been found that MgHPO4 and BaHPO4 were effective in selectivity converting amines to the corresponding higher molecular weight amine.Examples 76 82 The Sr Ni HPO4 catalyst of Example 24 was evaluated for the preparation of N 2 dimethylaminoethyl morpholine DMAEM with a feed mixture of morpholine MOR , dimethyl ethanolamine DMEA , distilled water, hydrogen and helium in the amounts shown below in Table 5 using the general procedure used in Examples 25 62 for the TEDA preparation. Specifically the condensation reaction was carried out at 3400C, 1 atmosphere of pressure and an LHSV in the range of 0.31 0.44 hr. as shown inTable 5 in the presence of 20 cc. of the Sr Ni HPO4 catalyst granules.Examples 83 86 The SrHPo4 catalyst of Example 6 was used in place of the Sr Ni HPO4 catalyst of Example 24 and the condensation reactions were carried out in the same manner as described under Examples 76 82.
