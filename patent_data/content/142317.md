## Description
CRYSTALLINE SILICATE ZSM 48 AND METHOD FOR ITS PREPARATION This invention relates to crystalline silicate ZSM 48 and to a method for its preparation. More especially, it relates to an improved method for preparing crystalline silicate ZSM 48 by means of which synthesis is facilitated and the zeolite product of which exhibits enhanced purity and catalytic activity when compared with ZSM 48 synthesized by known techniques. The crystalline zeolite ZSM 48 and methods for its preparation are described in European Patent 0 015 132 ZSM 48 is defined therein in terms of its compositional formula and its characteristic X ray diffraction pattern by means of which it is distinguished from other known crystalline zeolites. An alternative method for preparing ZSM 48 is described in European Patent 0 023 089. When it has beeh prepared by such conventional techniques, ZSM 48 is known to possess para selective catalytic properties however, its catalytic activity is relatively low in certain reactions. Also, the method for preparing ZSM 48 described in European Patent 0 023 089 requires a reaction mixture containing as organic directing agent a mixture of a C2 C12 alkylamine and a tetramethylammonium compound and a silica alumina mole ratio of at least about 500 to avoid product contamination with other zeolites, notably ZSM 5 and ZSM ll. According to the present invention, there is provided a synthetic crystalline silicate known as ZSM 48 having a compositional formula in the anhydrous state expressed in terms of moles of oxides per 100 moles of silica 0.05 to 5 R2O O.l to lO M20 0 to 4 Al203 l0O SiO2 in which M is an alkali metal cation and R is a cation derived from a linear diquaternary ammonium compound of the general formula R 3N Z mN R 33 X 2 in which each R is an alkyl or heteroalkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl or cycloheteroalkyl group having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms or an aryl or heteroaryl group Z is an alkylene or heteroalkylene group having from 1 to 20 carbom atoms, an alkenylene or heteroalkenylene group having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, or an arylene or heteroarylene group m is 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 and X is an anion and in which one or both quaternary nitrogens N can form part of a heteroaliphatic or heteroaromatic ring structure and the crystalline silicate being characterized by at least the following interplanar spacings d in Angstroms 1 Angstrom 0.1 nm and relative intensities 100I I0 derivable from the X ray diffraction pattern of the silicate in its calcined, sodium exchanged form d 100I Io 11.8 0.2 S 10.2 0.2 7.2 0.15 W 4.2 0.08 VS 3.9 0.08 VS 3.6 0.06 W 3.1 0.05 W 2.85 0.05 W The present invention also provides a method for preparing such a crystalline silicate, which comprises preparing a reaction mixture containing sources of alkali metal oxide, an oxide of aluminum, an oxide of silicon a cation of a linear diquaternary ammonium compound and water and having a composition expressed in terms of mole ratios of oxides falling within the following ranges Si02 A1203 at least 100 H20 SiO2 10 to 100 OH SiO2 0 to 1.0 M20 SiO2 0 to 1.0 R20 SiO2 0.005 to 1.0 in which M and R have the meanings given above, and maintaining the mixture at a temperature of 80 to 2000C until crystals of the silicate have formed. Preferably, the reaction mixture has a composition expressed in terms of mole ratios of oxides within the following ranges SiO2 A1203 100 to 10,000 N SiO2 20 to 70 OH SiO2 0.1 to 0.4 M20 SiO2 0.05 to 0.5 R20 SiO2 0.025 to 0.5 The quantity of OH is calculated only from the inorganic sources of alkali without any organic base contribution. Generally, the reaction mixture is maintained at a temperature of 80 to 2000C for a period of time of about 24 hours to about 200 days, more preferably at a temperature of about 100 to about 1800C for a period of time of about 48 hours to about 150 days. Such digestion of the gel particles is carried out until crystals form. The solid product is then separated from the reaction medium, for example by cooling the whole to room temperature, filtering of the crystals and washing the crystals with water. It should be noted that the method of the invention allows the reaction mixture silica alumina mole ratio to be much less than 500, for example as low as 100, to produce relatively pure ZSM 48. It should be noted also, however, that the reaction mixture silica alumina mole ratio is critical, since at less than about 100 a different crystalline silicate tends to form in place of the ZSM 48. ZSM 48 synthesized in accordance with the invention exhibits silica alumina mole ratios over a wide range and significantly enhanced catalytic activity in certain reactions of interest, including xylene isomerization and benzene alkylation, while maintaining para selectivity, and conversion of methanol and dimethylether into hydrocarbons, for example olefins. The effectiveness of the organic directing agent, i.e. the linear diquaternary ammonium compound, used according to the invention, when compared with other directing agents, such as the alkanediamines preferably used in the method of European Patent 0 015 132, and the mixtures of alkylamines and tetramethylammonium compounds used in the method of European Patent 0 023 089, is believed to be due to its ability to function as a template in the nucleation and growth of ZSM 48 crystals. The reaction mixture used for the synthesis of ZSM 48 according to the invention can be prepared utilizing materials which supply the appropriate oxides. Such compositions include aluminates, alumina, silicates, silica hydrosol, silica gel, silicic acid and hydroxides. It will be understood that each oxide component utilized in the reaction mixture can be supplied by one or more essential reactants and they can be mixed together in any order. For example, any oxide can be supplied by an aqueous solution of its hydroxide or by an aqueous solution of a suitable silicate and the diquaternary ammonium cation can be supplied by a suitable diquaternary ammonium compound, for example the hydroxide or a salt. The reaction mixture can be prepared either batchwise or continuously.The crystal size and crystallization time of the ZSM composition will vary with the exact nature of the reaction mixture employed. The organic directing agent used according to the invention is a linear diquaternary ammonium compound of the general formula R 3N z Z mN R 33 X 2 in which each R is an alkyl or heteroalkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, an aryl or heteroaryl group or a cycloalkyl or cycloheteroalkyl group having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms X is an anion for example fluoride1 chloride, bromide, iodide, hydroxide, sulfate, acetate, or other carboxylate ion Z is an alkylene or heteroalkylene group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, an alkenylene or heteroalkenylene group having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, or an arylene or heteroarylene group m is 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 and one or both N can form part of a heteroaliphatic or heteroaromatic ring structure, for example, EMI5.1 in which R is an alkyl or heteroalkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, an aryl or heteroaryl group or a cycloalkyl or cycloheteroalkyl group having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of such liner diquaternary ammonium compounds are CH3 3N CH2 6 CH3 3 Cl 2, C3H7 3N CH2 6 C3H7 3 Cl 2, C6H5 3N C2H4 N C6H5 3 OH 2, C18H37 3N C2H2 6N CH3 3 Br 2, C6H5 3N CH2 6 CH3 3 OH 2 and C6H5 3N C2H2 6N CH3 3 Cl 2. Preferred diquaternary ammonium compounds are those in which X is a halide, for example chloride, bromide or iodide, and R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl, and Z is an alkylene group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example methylene, ethylene, trimethylene and tetramethylene. The ZSM 48 prepared by the method of the invention has a characteristic X ray diffraction pattern in the calcined, sodium exchanged form, the significant interplanar spacings d and relative intensities 100I Io derived therefrom being set out above. The X ray diffraction pattern of the ZSM 48 is further characterized by the fact that it exhibits a singlet within the range of 11.8 0.2Angstroms, i.e. ZSM 48 does not have more than one X ray diffraction line at 11.8 0.2 Angstroms. The presence of this singlet structurally distinguishes ZSM 48 from closely related materials such as ZSM 12 U.S.Patent 3,832,449 which has a doublet at 11.8 0.2 Angatroms and high silica ZSM 12 U.S. Patent 4,104,294 which also exhibits a doublet at 11.8 0.2 Angstroms. The X ray diffraction pattern was determined by standard techniques.The radiation was the K alpha doublet of copper, and a diffractometer equipped with a scintillation counter and a strip chart pen recorder was used. The peak heights, I, and their positions as a function of two times theta, where theta is the Bragg angle, were read from the spectrometer chart. From these, the relative intensities, 100 1 leo where 10 is the intensity of the strongest peak, and d, the interplanar spacing in Angstroms corresponding to the recorded lines, were calculated. The relative intensities are given in terms of the symbolsW weak, M medium, S strong and VS very strong. Ion exchange of the sodium ions with other cations reveals substantially the same pattern with some minor shifts in interplanar spacings and variations in relative intensities.Other minor variations can occur depending on the silicon to aluminum ratio of the particular sample, and on whether the sample has been subjected to thermal treatment. The original cations associated with the ZSM 48 can be replaced, at least in part, by calcination and or ion exchange with other cations.Thus, the original cationic form may be exchanged into a hydrogen or hydrogen ion precursor form or a form in which the original cations have been replaced by a metal of Groups IIA, IIIA, IVA, 18, IIB, IIIB, IVB,VIB and VIII of the Periodic Table. Thus, it is possible to exchange the original cations with ammonium ions or with hydronium ions.Catalytically active forms of the zeolite include, in particular, the hydrogen, rare earth metal, aluminum, Group II metal, Group VIII metal and manganese forms. While the crystalline silicate ZSM 48 of the invention may be used in a wide variety of organic compound, for example hydrocarbon compound, conversion reactions, it is especially useful in polymerization, aromatization and cracking. Other conversion processes for which the ZSML48 may be utilized in one or more of its active forms include, for example, hydrocracking and converting light aliphatics into aromatics, for example by the process of U.S. Patent 3,760,024. Synthetic ZSM 48 prepared in accordance with the invention can be used either in the organic nitrogen containing and alkali metal containing form, the alkali metal and hydrogen form or another univalent or multivalent cationic form. It can also be used in intimate combination with a hydrogenating component such as tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum, rhenium, nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, or a noble metal such as platinum or palladium where a hydrogenation dehydrogenation function is to be performed. Such components can be exchanged into the zeolite or impregnated into or physically intimately mixed with a composition containing it.Thus, for example, in the case of platinum, the zeolite can be treated with a platinum metal containing ion, and suitable platinum compounds for this purpose include chloroplatinic acid, platinous chloride and various compounds containing the platinumammine complex. Synthetic ZSM 48, when employed either as an adsorbent or as a catalyst in a hydrocarbon conversion, should be dehydrated at least partially. This can be achieved by heating to a temperature of about 200 to about 6000C in an inert atmosphere, such as air or nitrogen, at atmospheric or subatmospheric pressures for between 1 and 48 hours.Dehydration can also be achieved at lower temperatures merely by placing the ZSM 48 in a vacuum, but a longer time is then required to obtain a sufficient amount of dehydration. As mentioned above, synthetic ZSM 48 prepared in accordance with the invention can have the original cations associated with it replaced by a wide variety of other cations according to techniques well known in the art. Typical replacing cations include hydrogen, ammonium and metal cations and mixtures thereof. Of the replacing metallic cations, particular preference is given to cations of such metals as rare earths, Mn, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cd, Pd, Ni, Cu, Ti, Al, Sn, Fe and Co. Typical ion exchange techniques involve contacting the synthetic ZSM 48 with a salt of the desired replacing cation or cations. Although a wide variety of salts can be employed, particular preference is given to the chlorides, nitrates and sulfates. Representative ion exchange techniques are described in a wide variety of publications including U.S. Patents 3,140,249 3,140,251 and 3,140,253. Following contact with the solution of the salt of the desired replacing cation, the zeolite is then preferably washed with water and dried at a temperature of 65 to about 3l50C and thereafter calcined in air or other inert gas at a temperature of about 200 to about 815 C for a period of time of 1 to 48 hours or more to produce a catalytically active thermal decomposition product. Regardless of the cation replacing the alkali metal in the synthesized form of the ZSM 48, the spatial arrangement of the aluminum, silicon and oxygen atoms which form the basic crystal lattices of the ZSM 48 remains essentially unchanged as determined by taking an X ray powder diffraction pattern of the ion exchanged material. The crystalline ZSM 48 prepared by the method of the invention is formed in a wide variety of particle sizes. Generally, however, the ZSM 48 will be used as a catalyst in the form of a powder, granules a molded product, such as an extrudate, having a particle size sufficient to pass through a 2 mesh Tyler screen and be retained on a 400 mesh Tyler screen. In cases where the catalyst is molded, such as by extrusion, the ZSM 48 can be composited and extruded before drying or dried or partially dried and then composited and extruded. As in the case of many catalytic materials, it is desirable to composite the ZSML48 with another material resistant to the temperatures and other conditions employed in organic conversion processes. Such matrix materials include active and inactive materials and synthetic or naturally occurring zeolites as well as inorganic materials such as clays, silica and or metal oxides, for example alumina. The latter may be either naturally occurring or in the form of gelatinous precipitates, sols or gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides. Use of a material which is catalytically active may enhance the conversion and or selectivity of the resulting catalyst in certain organic conversion processes.Inactive materials suitably serve as diluents to control the amount of conversion in a given process so that products can be obtained in an economic and orderly manner without employing other means for controlling the rate of reaction. Frequently, crystalline silicate materials have been incorporated into naturally occurring clays, for example bentonite and kaolin. These materials, that is clays and oxides, function, in part, as binders for the catalyst. It is desirable to provide a catlyst having good crushing strength, because in a petrole0 refinery the catalyst is often subject to rough handling, which tends to break the catalyst down into powder like materials which cause problems in processing. Naturally occurring clays which can be composited with the ZSM 48 include the montmorillonite and kaolin families which include the sub bentonites, and the kaolins commonly known as Dixie, McNamee, Georgia and Florida clays, or others in which the main mineral constituent is halloysite, kaolinite, dickite, nacrite or anauxite. Such clays can be used in the raw state as originally mined or initially subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chemical modification. In addition to the foregoing materials, the ZSM 48 can be composited with a porous matrix material such as silica alumina, silica magnesia, silica zirconia, silica thoria, silica beryllia, silica titania, as well as ternary compositions such as silica alumina thoria, silica alumina z irconia, silica alumina magnesia and silica magnesia zirconia. The matrix can be in the form of a co gel. A mixture of these components can also be used. The relative proportions of finely divided crystalline silicate ZSM 48 and inorganic oxide gel matrix vary widely with the crystalline silicate content ranging from about 1 to about 90 percent by weight, preferably about 2 to about 50 percent by weight of the composite. Using a catalyst containing ZSM 48 according to the invention and containing also a hydrogenation component, reforming stocks can be reformed at temperatures of 370 to 5400C, pressures of 790 to 7000 kPa, preferably 1480 to 5000 kPa and liquid hourly space velocities of 0.1 to 10, preferably 0.5 to 4 and a hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio of 1 to 20, preferably 4 to 12. Such catalysts incorporating a hydrogenation component, for example platinum, can also be used for hydroisomerization of normal paraffins.Hydroisomerization may be carried out at temperatures of 90 to 3700C, preferably 140 to 2900C, at liquid hourly space velocities of 0.01 to 2, preferably 0.25 to 0.50, and a hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio of 1 to 5. Additionally, such catalysts can be used for olefin or aromatics isomerization at temperatures of O to 3700C. Catalyst containing ZSM 48 can also be used for reducing the pour point of gas oils, at liquid hourly space velocities of about 10 to about 30 and temperatures of about 400 to 540oC. Other reactions that can be carried out employing ZSM 48 catalysts containing a metal, for example platinum, include hydrogenation dehydrogenation, desulfurization, olefin polymerization oligomerization , and other organic compound conversions such as the conversion of alcohols for example methanol into hydrocarbons. The following examples illustrate the invention. EXAMPLES The Examples set out in following Table 1 were carried out to demonstrate the synthesis of crystalline silicate ZSML48. The method of the invention enables pure ZSM 48 to be produced with a higher tetrahedral aluminum content and hence much higher catalytic activity than has been the case with conventional methods. The linear diquaternary ammonium compounds used in the Examples had the structure CH3 3 N CH2 m N CH3 3 X 2 with m 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 and X Br or I. Diquat 6 m 6 was used as the iodide salt whereas each of Diquat 5 , Diquat 8 , Diquat 9 and Diquat 10 m 5, 8, 9 or 10 was used as the bromide salt. The other components used in Examples 1, 2, 3 and 6 were silica sol 30 SiO2 , NaOH and water no separate aluminum source was added.For Example 9, the other components were silica sol 30 SiO2 , NaA102, NaOH and water. In the case of Examples 4 and 5, Q 3rand sodium silicate 27.8 SiO2 8.4 Na20 63.8 H20 and water were the other components no separate aluminum source was added, but H2SO4 was added to adjust the OH SiO2 mole ratios to the desired levels. For Examples 7, 8 and 10 to 15, the other components were t Q Brand sodium silicate, Al2 SO4 3 16H20, and water. Again, the desired OH SiO2 mole ratios in the initial hydrogels were attained by addition of H2504. In each Example listed in Table 1, the crystallization time is given together with the resulting zeolite product. The crystallizatron temperature was maintained at 160 C with stirring in each case. I should be noted from Example 15 that when the SiO2 A12C3 ratio of the reaction mixture is less than 100, synthesis with a diquaternary cation, at the proper composition, produces a different crystalline silicate framework and not ZSM 48. The final product of each Example was filtered off, washed with water, and dried at 1100C.
