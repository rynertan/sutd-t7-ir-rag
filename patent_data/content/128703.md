# Non contact controlled micropump.

## Abstract
An implantable micropump comprises a refillable chamber 5 for pharmaceutical liquid, a bellows 1 which is expanded by air or gas so as to urge liquid from the chamber 5 , and a valve 6 . The valve 6 is controllable by a remotely actuated electromagnet 9 . The micropump can also include a pressure regulating valve inwhich the valve member is urged towards a valve seal by a first elastic force, and is urged away from the valve seat to allow passage of liquid in response to pressure on a diaphragm on the downstream side dropping below a prede termined value.
