# AIR CONDITIONER FOR AUTOMOTIVE VEHICLE

## Abstract
A calculating unit 40 calculates from sensed tempera tures of ambient air both outside and inside of the vehicle com partment the desired opening of an air mix door 22 which controls the ratio of heated to cold air driven, into the vehicle compartment. When the output of the calculating unit 40 indi cates that the air mix door 22 should be moved to the fully cooling position, a controller 42 moves the air mix door 22 via an actuator 26 in accordance with the output of the calcu lating unit 40 so as to completely cover the heater 20 , there by preventing air from passing through the heater 20 and from being heated. Shortly after the air mix door 22 has com pletely covered the heater 20 , a second controller 44 cuts off the supply of heating energy to the heater. When, on the contrary, the output of the calculating unit 40 indicates that the air mix door 22 should be moved away from the fully cool ing position, the heating energy begins to be conducted into the heater 20 , thereby allowing the temperature of the air in the compartment to increase gradually. In an alternative, a sig nal controller including a mechanical linkage responds to the output of the calculating unit via the controller. When the air mix door should be moved to the fully cooling position, the me chanical linkage pivots the air mix door to the position where the air mix door completely covers the heater. Shortly after that, the linkage continues to move to a position in which the supply of heating energy is stopped.
