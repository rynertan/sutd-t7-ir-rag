# Method and apparatus for transverse stretching of a film or web.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for transversely stretching a longitudinally continuous fibrous web or film like material of organic synthetic thermoplastic polymeric material in which the opposite selvages of the web or film M are gripped and are stretched transversely during heating by gripping means 11, 12, 17, 18 , the stretched film being thereafter released. In order to avoid drawbacks in existing equipment such as cost and rupture of the material being stretched, the stretching of the film or web M by the gripping means 11, 12, 17, 18 takes place by moving the selvages along two divergent arcuate paths lying in the same plane.
