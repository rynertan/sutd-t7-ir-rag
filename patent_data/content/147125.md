# On load tap changer.

## Abstract
An on load tap changer comprises a rotary selector switch 24 including a plurality of contacts which are divided according to phases into groups which are arranged in the axial direction of the tap changer, a rotary change over switch 90 including a plurality of contacts 48, 50, 88, and an intermittent drive mechanism 60 connected between the selector switch and the change over switch for intermittently transmitting the rotary motion of the selector switch of the change over switch. The intermittent drive mechanism 60 has an asymmetrical shape which provides a closest portion arm 70 that is closest to the contacts of the change over switch. The contacts of the change over switch are divided into groups according to phases, which are arranged in the circumferential direction of the change over switch. The intermittent drive mechanism 60 is at an electrical potential equal to that of the contacts of the selector switch 24 clsosest to the intermittent drive mechanism, and the closest portion of the intermittent drive mechanism is positioned within the phase region of the changeover switch corresponding to the closest phase of the selector switch.
