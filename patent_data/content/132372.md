# Method of and apparatus for examining automotive headlamp.

## Abstract
A method of examining the state of alignment of headlamp beam axis has the following steps taking up by a TV camera 2a, 2b the image of the light distribution pattern of a headlamp beam on a screen 9a, 9b specifying a closed curved area of illumina tion intensities higher than a predetermined level in the taken up image of the light distribution pattern determining the position of the geometrical center of the specified closed curved area and displaying the position of the geometrical center on a monitor TV 4a, 4b measuring the area of the specified closed curved area comparing the measured actual area of the closed curved area with a command area adjusting the quantity of light received by the TV camera 2a, 2b in accordance with the result of the comparison until the measured actual area of the closed curved area becomes equal to the command area and displaying, on a monitor TV 4a, 4b , a pattern representing the allowable range and a mark representing the position of the beam axis. When the marks falls within the allowable range, it is judged that the state of alignment of the beam axis is acceptable.
