# Resin composition for solder resist ink.

## Abstract
A resin composition for use in a solder resist ink. The composition consists essentially of A an epoxy vinyl ester resin solution obtained by dis solving A a an epoxy vinyl ester resin obtained by the reac tion of 1.0 chemical equivalent of a phenol novolak type epoxy resin and or a cresol novolak type epoxy resin with 0.4 to 0.85 chemical equivalent of an unsaturated monobasic acid in A b an organic solvent and or A c at least one photo polymerizable polyfunctional vinyl monomer selected from the group consisting of trifunctional or higher polyoxyal kylene glycol poly meth acrylates, poly meth acrylates of polyoxyalkyl isocyanurates and poly meth acrylates of acetal compounds, B a photopolymerization initiator, and C an amine type curing agent.
