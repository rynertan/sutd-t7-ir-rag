# INDUCTION MOTOR DRIVING DEVICE.

## Abstract
An induction motor driving device for driving an induction motor 10 on the basis of current commands iu, iv, iw of three phases output by using the deviation ER between a speed command and the actual speed n . This driving device has the means 31 for receiving the speed deviation ER , the actual speed n , for digitally processing sinusoidal signals I
