## Description
PHOTOVOLTAT C S ClIOTTKY BAPRIE R ELEMENTS The present invention relates to photovoltaicSchottky barrier elements using ruthenium dioxide as the metallic contact thereof. Known photovoltaic structures include homojunctions, i.e. p n 13 devices within a single semiconductor material heterojunctions between differing semiconductors 23. Schottky barrier structures with metal contacts on semiconductors 33 or degenerate semiconductors on semiconductor 4 ITo on GaAs or Sil. Also a metal oxide with metallic conductivity has been identified E 3 , namely ruthenium dioxide. Recently it has been reported 6 that ultrafine deposits of Pt and RuO2 on colloidal particles of CdS inhibit photocorrosion and catalyze water photoelectrolysis.CdS is an n type semiconductor with a band gap energy of 2.4 eV corresponding to a light wavelength of 517 nm.Contrary to the behaviour of other semiconductor electrodes e.g. TiO2 , CdS electrodes do not oxidize water under illumination but are subjected themselves to a photocorrosion process, whereby sulphide ions are rapidly oxidized to sulphrtr E7 . This corrosion reaction can be prevented if a reducing agent e.g. polysulphide is added to the electrolyte 83. The photocorrosion inhibiting, and specifically water oxidizing effect observed in the microheterogeneous CdS system is due to the presence of RuO2 whereas Pt is known to catalyze specifically the hydrogen evolution reaction.If the water photoelectrolysis process of the microheterogeneousCdS system is explained by the model of a microelectrochemical cell E6J , the question arises whether the stabilizing ability of RuO2 can be also exploited in a macroscopic photoelectrochemical cell consisting of aCdS electrode covered by a thin RuO2 film and a Pt counter electrode. It has now been found that a photovoltaic Schottkybarrier effect can be obtained with RuO2 overlayers on CdS electrodes. We have not been able to reproduce all the results obtained with the known colloidal particles in particular, hydrogen evolution could not be observed. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a photovoltaic Schottky barrier element comprising a semiconductor substrate carrying a ruthenium dioxide layer as the metallic contact thereof. Preferably the substrate is cadmium sulphide and the ruthenium dioxide layer has been applied to the substrate by spluttering. The element may be constructed with, on the side of the substrate opposite to that side on which the ruthenium dioxide layer is carried, at least oneOhmic contact, preferably of indium. The present invention also provides a solar cell and a photochemical cell comprising, as the photovoltaic element or electrode, respectively, thereof, a photovoltaic Schottky barrier element of the present invention. The present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows the relaxation of dark current with time for a photovoltaic Schottky barrier element of the present invention, following the application of a voltage pulse Figure 2 shows the element s dependence of current on voltage for the dark and illuminated electrodes at pH 12 under quasi steady state conditions curve a being for o a OdS electrode with a 500 A Ru02 overlayer, and curve b being for a bare CdS electrode Figure 3 shows the current voltage characteristics for a continuous potential sweep of CdS electrodes with o 2000 A Ru02 overlayers at pH 12 curve a being before breakdown and curve b being after breakdown Figure 4 are the Mott Schottky plots for a a bare Cas electrode, and b a CdS electrode with 500 Ru02 overlayer at pH 12 Figure 5 shows the current voltage characteristics of an electrochemical solar cell of the type Pt 0.2 m Na2504 RuO2 CdS cell Figure 6 shows the element current characteristic at a fixed potential of 0.2 V SCE , in the presence of solvated oxygen in the electrolyte Figure 7 shows in a corrosion experiment, the plot of the concentration of Cd experimentally determined in the electrolyte vs. the concentration of Cd calculated on the basis of charge passed assuming 100t corrosion Figures 8aand b shows, for a solid state Schottkybarrier CdS Ru02 solar cell a its current voltage characteristic in darkness and under illumination, and b its Mott Schottky relationship Figure 9 shows diagrammatically the structure of a solar cell having a Schottky barrier at the interface between the semiconductor and the ruthenium dioxide layers and Figure 10 shows the spectral response of the solar cell of Figure 9. CdS single crystals of 10 mm diameter and 2mm thickness with the lll face Cd atoms exposed to the electrolyte were used experimentally. The donor density was 1015 cm 3. Before film deposition, the crystals were polished mechanically by using diamond powder of 1 Sm and then etched for about 1 minute in concentrated HCl. Ohmic back contacts were made by depositing indium at 4000C in a hydrogen atmosphere. Ru02 films were deposited by RF sputtering by using a RUO2 powder target. The sputtering process was performed in a pure Ar, a 50 2 gas mixture and a pure oxygen plasma. The sputtering rate was between 0.5 pure Ar plasma and 0.2 s pure oxygen plasma . Films o of various thickness between 100 and 5000 A were made.The chemical composition was analyzed by ESCA measurements.Films sputtered in oxygen plasma revealed the stoichiometric composition whereas films sputtered in the pure Ar plasma were slightly substoichiometric with respect to 02. The electrodes were mounted in Perspex holders and sealed with type 240 SB polymeric resin based lacquer of Electro Science Laboratories, Inc. The electrochemical measurements were performed in a single compartment cell with a calomel reference electrode and a Pt black counter electrode. A PAR model 173 potentiostat was used in conjunction with a PAR model 175 programmer and a PAR model 186 lock in amplifier. Illumination was from a 1000 W xenon lamp filtered by 10 cm of water.The light was interrupted by an Ealing model 22 8411 electrical shutter. With exception of the corrosion experiments, in all experiments the light level was kept at very low values of the order of a few milliwatts cm2 to avoid damage to the elctrodes by possible photocorrosion effects. The light intensity was measured by a Kipp Zoen calibrated thermopile. As monochromator a Spex model Minimate was used. If not otherwise stated, light of 500 nm wavelength is used. Capacity was determined by superimposing on the potentiostaticallycontrolled d c voltage an a c voltage of 50 100 mV amplitude while measuring the amplitude change and phase shift caused by an external resistance inserted in series with the electrochemical cell. All chemicals used were of Analar grade. Water was deionized and bidistilled. In all experiments, 0.2 N Na2S04, adjusted to various pH values either by addition of NaOH or of H2S04, was used as electrolyte. The current potential characteristics of Ru02 covered CdS electrodes were found to be subject to strong transient effects with relaxation times in the order of several minutes. Figure 1 demonstrates this by a current time plot of a CdS electrode covered with a o 500 A thick Ru02 film. The eledtrode was intermittently illuminated and a pulse of 0.2 to 0.4 V SCE was applied.It is interesting to note that only the dark current shows a transient behaviour whereas the photocurrent response remains prompt. In order to eliminate the influence of these transients, the current voltage dependence of Figure 2a was recorded in quasi steady state conditions by applying the respective potential 8 minutes before measuring the current density. Under this condition, the dark current decreased to a very low level and the i V dependence assumed the typical behaviour of an n type semiconductor electrode. In comparison with the i V dependence of the bare CdS electrode Figure 2b , the photocurrent onset potential was shifted to more anodic values, and a cathodic dark current was observable already at potentials slightly cathodic of O V SCE .The reduced sensitivity of the Ru02 covered electrode was caused by strong light absorption in the Ru02 layer.If the i V dependence was measured by applying a continuous potential sweep however, curves of different shape depending on the film preparation and the initial potential setting were obtained. Figures 3a and 3b show two characteristic examples obtained with about o 2000 A thick overlayers of Ru02 on CdS electrodes, at a sweep rate of 10 mV s at pH 12. In some cases a breakdown effect was observed if the potential exceeded a value of about 0.5 V SCE . In these cases the originally observed i V dependence of the type shown in Figure 3a, was modified to that shown in Figure 3b. It should be noted that in these cases the photoresponse was not affected the breakdown phenomenon being observed in the dark characteristics. The dependence of the capacity of the space charge layer Csc on the electrode potential was measured, at pH 12 using a modulation frequency of 50 kHz, in a potential range where the dark current density was smaller than 1 pA cmê. At lower modulation frequencies, dispersion was observed. In order to obtain linearMott Schottky plots Csc 2 vs V , it was necessary to maintain a constant electrode potential for several minutes before measuring the capacities. Figure 4 shows the result for a CdS electrode covered with a o 500 A thick overlayer of Ru02 in comparison with a blank CdS electrode. The effect of the Ru02 overlayer is evidently to shift the flat band potential by 0.5 V to a value of U 0.7 V, which is anodic of the hydrogen evolution potential.The different slopes of both curves indicate also a change in the charge carrier density from 1.4 x 1015 cm 3 for the blank to 0.9 x 1014 cm 3 for the film covered electrode. An electrochemical solar cell has been made by connecting the semiconductor with the counter electrode in series with a variable resistive load. Figure 5 compares the power characteristic obtained with and without a Ru02 overlayer on the CdS electrode at pH 7, using intermittent light of 500 nm wavelength.Both short circuit current isc and open circuit voltage roc are smaller for the film covered electrode.Voc is only 0.3 V. Figure 6 shows the time t dependence of sc for the same film covered electrode. For ten minutes the electrolyte was exposed to air then N2 was bubbled for a further ten minutes finally 2 was bubbled through the electrolyte. N2 bubbling diminished sc and 2 bubbling had the contrary effect. This behaviour suggests that the interfacial cathodic reaction is oxygen reduction rather than the hydrogen evolution observed with the microheterogeneous system 6. A series of corrosion tests has been performed by analyzing samples of the electrolyte for dissolved Cud ions by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Figure 7 shows the concentration of cadmium experimentally determined in the electrolyte as a function of the concentration of cadmium calculated on the basis of charge passed through the cell. In all cases the light level was regulated so that the current density did not exceed 200 pA cm2 the potential was adjusted to 0.2 V SCE . Only at pH 12 was a corrosion inhibiting effect indicated however, in this alkaline electrolyte the ionic solubility of cadmium is known to be low, so that any conclusion must be qualified.A close inspection of the electrode surface by optical and scanning electron microscopy after this corrosion experiment revealed an inhomogeneous deposit of sulphur it is suggested that corrosion is initiated at the ruthenium dioxide film defects pinholes or microcracks which allow direct contact of the electrolyte to the cas crystal. It has been shown Figure 1 that the photocurrent of a Ru02 covered CdS electrode is essentially independent of the dark current transient behaviour. Furthermore, the photocurrent of different electrodes behaves very similarly in spite of the fact that dark currents are subjected to considerable changes Figure 3 . These observations suggest that dark and photocurrent behaviour are not interrelated, differing from the usual case for a semiconductor electrolyte junction. A possible explanation is to consider the RuO2 covered CdS electrode as being composed of a photoelectrochemically inactive electrolyte Ru02 junction and series connected photo active Ru02 CdSSchottky barrier. A similar model was proposed byHarris and Coworkers 093 to explain the role of metal overlayers on gap electrodes.However, a Schottkybarrier at the Ru02 interface can only be formed if RuO2 exhibits metallic conductivity that this is actually the case has been shown by Lodi and Coworkers 5100 from the temperature dependence of the conductivity, and recently by Riga and Coworkers Cllg by an investigation of the electronic structure with the Esca method. It turned out that the metal like character is due to a partially filled 4D band at the fermi level. To support our hypothesis, we investigated more closely the i v dependence and the Mott Schottky characteristic of a solid state RuO2 CdS junction.Figures 8a and b show the results obtained with aRu02 overlayer of 1500 A thickness. The junction is actually photoactive and shows a i v dependence which is characteristic for a leaky diode with an open circuit voltage Voc of 0.3 V. This value is in agreement withVoc obtained with the electrochemical cell Figure 5 .The Mott Schottky plot of the space charge layer capacity shows a linear behaviour from which is Schottky barrier height of ECB 0.5 V is derived. This value compares well with Voc considering the relatively low illumination level at the depth of the Schottky barrier due to absorption in the overlayer. The dark current behaviour of a Ru02 electrode has been investigated by Lodi and Coworkers G23 . It is characterized by a strong oxidation reduction wave similar to that displayed in Figure 3b. Also strong transient currents with relaxation times of several minutes have been observed. Considering that our Rut2 CdS diode is leaky , this dark current behaviour might easily be displayed in the whole potential range as observed in Figure 3b. If the diode, however, shows a blocking behaviour, then the characteristic observed inFigure 3a is expected. We assume that the different i V curves are essentially due to an uncontrolled diode characteristic. In particular, the breakdown effect is localized at the Schottky interface. A photocorrosion inhibiting effect of the RuO2 overlayer is an expected consequence of the proposed model. With a fully homogeneous film, corrosion should be completely suppressed. It has been noted that corrosion is initiated at film defects. Subsequently it is assumed that current at the defects sites dominated, with, as a consequence, the continued photocorrosion observed. Assuming, however, that the RuO2 film protects the CdS crystal from direct contact with the electrolyte, we must consider the charge transfer mechanism in theRu02 layer. With metallic conductivity in this oxide, photoexcited holes from the semiconductor injected across the Schottkv barrier, would be expected to recombine rapidly. In this case, the maximum cell voltage is equal to the height of the Schottky barrier of 0.5 V.Photoelectrolytic water decomposition is not, therefore, to be expected. The anodic interfacial reaction is supposed to be the oxygen evolution to which a transient proton absorption process as proposed for the Ru02 electrode UoJ might be superimposed. For the cathodic reaction at the Pt counter electrode, the oxygen reduction reaction is suggested. The question arises why water photoelectrolysis occurs in the microheterogeneous system and not in a macroscopic electrochemical cell of the type investigated. Several reasons might be responsible for this discrepancy i the increasing influence of surface states with decreasing partizle size might change the nature of the RuO2 CdS junction ii ultra thin RuO2 films as supposed to cover the colloidal particles E63 can have different properties than regularly formed RuO2 crystals. Actually it is known from experimental and theoretical studies 13, 14 that small changes of the lattice geometry can cause a metal semiconductor transition.Semiconducting properties of the Ru02 film could better explain the supposed 6Jhole transfer properties iii it is expected that the influence of attached hydroxyl groups is larger in the microheterogeneous systems than for an homogeneously covered macroscopic electrode. The importance of hydroxyl groups for the catalytic properties Of RuO2 has been mentioned E153. In Figure 9, the structure of a solar cell is diagrammatically shown in which a Schottky barrier has been established at the interface between the semiconductor and the ruthenium dioxide layers. Indium is preferably used as the Ohmic contact, and Figure 10 shows the spectral response of such a solar cell showing a cut off at 530 nm, which is indicative of the cell operating by optical absorption and carrier formation in the semiconductor, in this case CdS.References Lii Siliconhomojunction cell Fischer, H., Festkorper probleme XIV 1974 , P. 153 Buhs, R., Nagel G., and Wegmann, H.D., and E.C.
