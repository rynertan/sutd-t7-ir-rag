# An electrical power supply.

## Abstract
A power supply circuit comprises an input choke 30 having one end connected to one side 28 of a DC supply source connection from a bridge 20 a transformer 34 and a circuit loop connected between another end of said input choke 30 and another side 38 of said DC supply source connection. This circuit loop includes a series connec tion of a capacitor 36 , a switching device 44 and a primary winding 32 of the transformer 34 . The switching device 44 includes a controlled conduction path and a control input 49 for rendering the conduction path conductive. The capacitor 36 is arranged to be charged primarily by the DC supply source bridge 20 . There is provided a resistive capacitive trigger circuit 54, 56, 58 connected between the DC supply source bridge 20 connection and the control input 49 for repetitively rendering the switching device 44 conductive at a predetermined repetitive rate so as to repetitively discharge the capacitor 36 through the primary winding 32 . The transformer 34 includes a secondary winding 64 and has a predetermined turns ratio between the secondary winding 64 and the primary winding 32 . The power supply circuit further comprises output circuit means 72, 78 for rectifying and filtering the output of the secondary winding 64 to provide the output of the power supply circuit.
