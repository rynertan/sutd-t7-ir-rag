# Data processor controller.

## Abstract
A data processor controller for a microprogramming system is constructed with a single operation execution unit 2 serving both a microprocessor and a peripheral device such as a direct memory access controller. In addition to the single operation execution unit, the controller includes a micro memory 11 which stores micro instructions for con trolling both the microprocessor and the peripheral device, and address registers, multiplexers and decoders inte grated into a single device A . Different ROM address regis ters in the controller are sparately assigned to provide an address decoder with addresses of selected memory loca tions in the micro memory containing the micro instruction for the microprocessor and the peripheral device, thereby enabling the controller, through multiplexing between the address registers, to use the arithmetic execution unit, counter and bus interface of the single operation execution unit on a time sharing basis, for controlling the functions of both the microprocessor and the peripheral device.
