# A connection device.

## Abstract
A connection device is described which comprises a male member 12 which may be received in a female socket member 13 . Cam means 30 is journaled in an eccentric cam follower surface 34 in the socket 13 for rotation about a second axis displaced from the axis of the socket 13 . Means, preferably a fluid member 17 , is provided for rotat ing the cam means in first and second opposite directions so that when the abutment surface 21 of the male member 12 is received in an aperture 38 in the cam means and the cam means is rotated in the first direction, a locking surface 41 of the cam means 30 is moved radially inward ly and in a longitudinal direction away from the entrance of the socket to engage the abutment surface 21 to lock the male member in the socket. Subsequent rotation of the cam means 30 in the opposite direction releases the engage ment. An expelling surface 42 may be provided on the cam means to aid in expelling the male member from the socket, preferably by engaging an expulsion surface 22 provided on the male member 12 .
