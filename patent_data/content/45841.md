# Linear voltage current converter.

## Abstract
A linear voltage current converter circuit having a sim plified circuit structure and operabel over a wide voltage range is disclosed. The circuit comprises a fist transistor Q1 having a drain connected to a power voltage through a first load element Q5 , a second Q2 and a third Q3 transistor having drains connected to the power voltage through a second load element Q6 , means for supplying gates of the first and second transistor with voltage signal, means 7 responsive to a voltage difference at drains of the first Q1 and second Q2 transistors for controlling a gate voltage of the third transistor Q3 so as to reduce the voltage difference to zero, an output transistor Q4 , and means for supplying a gate of the output transistor Q4 with the same voltage as the gate voltage of the third transistor Q3 .
