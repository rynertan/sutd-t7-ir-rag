# Josephson junction devices.

## Abstract
A Josephson junction device consists of a barrier layer 12 between layers 10, 11 of superconductive material. The minimum size of the device is determined by its inductance which is inversely related to the circulating supercurrent density, so that for compactness this current density requires to be high. Reliability in manufacture requires that the barrier layer should not be excessively thin and in order to obtain critical damping, the barrier capacitance must be kept low, so that the barrier material should not have a high dielectric constant. The present invention provides a Josephson junction device with a barrier which can support large circulating supercurrent densities without being excessively thin, which can readily be manufactured, and, if required, readily doped, and which has a relatively low dielectric constant. The barrier of a device according to the invention is of hydrated amorphous semiconductor material, the semiconductor being silicon, germanium or a silicon germanium alloy. The barrier layer may be deposited by sputtering in a atmosphere containing hydrogen, and it may be doped with phosphorus, arsenic or antimony in manufacture. The device may include a control line 18 .
