# Polyisocyanate compositions, polyurethane prepolymers and their use.

## Abstract
A composition consisting essentially of a solution in an aliphatic diisocyanate of the reaction product of at least two moles of said aliphatic diisocyanate, preferably 4,4 methylenebis cyclohexylisocyanate , with the addition pro duct formed from one mole of a diprimary aliphatic diamine, preferably 4,4 methylenebis cyclohexylamine , and at least one mole of an activated monoethylenic compound, e.g. methylacrylate. A polyurethane prepolymer based on this compositions and a polyhydroxy compound, e.g. a polypropylene ether triol, may be moisture cured in the presence of a catalyst, preferably dibutyltin dilaurate. Such moisture curable polyurethan compositions are useful in polyurethane coatings, especially for decorative sur faces, such as flooring.
