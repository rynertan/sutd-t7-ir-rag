# DIGITAL ENCODING AND DECODING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A code converter 133 acts between data transfer appa ratus 605 and a disk unit 125 . When encoding for a write operation, data codes in an input register 1005 are trans ferred to a latch 1008 together with a two bit state code 1010 . A ROM 1011 implements run length limited RLL coding by prodividing a new state code 1010 and a three bit disk code to output register 1013 and serial line 1027 to disk in response to an address from the latch 1008 made up of the current input di bit, the next input di bit and the current state code. The same ROM effects the complementary decod ing of current and next tri bit disk codes fed serially into the in put register on read line 1025 in conjunction with the current state code, to produce the new state code 1010 and the out put di bit passed via the output register 1013 to an output latch 1015 . The tri bit disk codes to be decoded may include errors, especially single bit errors, which will render them non conforming codes which lead to no valid decode. However the ROM 1011 is extended to decode non conforming codes as well as confirming codes. Since there is an error condition al ready this cannot make matters worse but by appropriate choice of the extended decoding e.g. so as to minimize Hamming distance between a non conforming sequence of two tri bits and an assumed replacement therefor a high pro bability that the resulting data codes are correct will be achieved.
