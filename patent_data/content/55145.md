# 4 Aminomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylic acid derivatives.

## Abstract
4 N 3 ,4 Methylenedioxybenzylidene amino methyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylic acid, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a C₁ C₄, alkyl ester thereof, are useful for the treatment of inflammation, thrombosis, hypertension, asthma, cancer, rheumatism or systemic lupus erythematosus. These compounds can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions and are prepared by reacting 3,4 methylene dioxybenzaldehyde with 4 aminomethylcy clohexane 1 carboxylic acid or a C₁ C₄ alkyl ester thereof, and optionally converting the resulting compound into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.
