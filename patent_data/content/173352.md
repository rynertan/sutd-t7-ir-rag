## Description
The present invention relates to a radiation image storage panel employed in a radiation image recording and reproducing method utilizing a stimulable phosphor, and a process for the preparation of said panel. More particularly, the invention relates to a radiation image storage panel comprising a support and a phosphor layer provided thereon which comprises a binder and a stimulable phosphor dispersed therein, and a process for the preparation of said panel. For obtaining a radiation image, there has been conventionally employed a radiography utilizing a combination of a radiographic film having an emulsion layer containing a photosensitive silver salt material and a radiographic intensifying screen. As a method replacing the above described radiography, a radiation image recording and reproducing method utilizing a stimulable phosphor as described, for instance, in U.S. A 4,239,968, has been recently paid much attention. In the radiation image recording and reproducing method, a radiation image storage panel comprising a stimulable phosphor i.e., stimulable phosphor sheet , is used, and the method involves steps of causing the stimulable phosphor of the panel to absorb radiation energy having passed through an object or having radiated from an object sequentially exciting the stimulable phosphor with an electromagnetic wave such as visible light or infrared rays hereinafter referred to as stimulating rays to release the radiation energy stored in the phosphor as light emission stimulated emission photoelectrically detecting the emitted light to obtain electric signals and reproducing the radiation image of the object as a visible image from the electric signals. In the radiation image recording and reproducing method, a radiation image is obtainable with a sufficient amount of information by applying a radiation to the object at considerably smaller dose, as compared with the conventional radiography. Accordingly, the radiation image recording and reproducing method is of great value especially when the method is used for medical diagnosis. The radiation image storage panel employed in the radiation image recording and reproducing method has a basic structure comprising a support and a phosphor layer provided on one surface of the support. Further, a transparent film is generally provided on the free surface surface not facing the support of the phosphor layer to keep the phosphor layer from chemical deterioration or physical shock. The phosphor layer comprises a binder and stimulable phosphor particles dispersed therein. The stimulable phosphor emits light gives stimulated emission when excited with stimulating rays such as visible light or infrared rays after having been exposed to a radiation such as X rays. Accordingly, the radiation having passed through an object or having radiated from an object is absorbed by the phosphor layer of the radiation image storage panel in proportion to the applied radiation dose, and a radiation image of the object is produced in the panel in the form of a radiation energy stored image. The radiation energy stored image can be released as stimulated emission by sequentially irradiating scan ning the panel with stimulating rays. The stimulated emission is then photoelectrically detected to obtain electric signals, so as to reproduce a visible image from the electric signals. Such a phosphor layer of the radiation image storage panel is conventionally prepared by procedures of adding stimulable phosphor particles and a binder to an appropriate solvent to prepare a homogeneous coating dispersion comprising phosphor particles dispersed in a binder solution, applying the coating dispersion onto a support using a doctor blade, a roll coater, etc., and heating a layer of the coating dispersion to dryness. Otherwise, the phosphor layer is initially formed on a sheet by applying the coating dispersion thereon and then the phosphor layer is combined with the support. The phosphor particles are uniformly dispersed in the prepared phosphor layer, and therefore, the surface of the phosphor layer is provided with finely protruded and depressed portions because of the appearance of phosphor particles. To protect the stimulable phosphor on the surface of the phosphor layer from chemical deterioration or physical shock and to provide the panel with a smooth surface, a protective film is usually provided on the surface of the phosphor layer by applying a solution of transparent polymer material thereon or combining a previously prepared transparent film with the phosphor layer using an adhesive agent. It is desired for the radiation image storage panel employed in the radiation image recording and reproducing method to have a high sensitivity and to provide an image of high quality high sharpness, high graininess, etc. , as well as a radiographic intensifying screen employed in the conventional radiography. However, when the radiation image storage panel has a protective film, the light stimulating rays tends to be scattered on the interface of the phosphor layer and the protective film. Particularly in the case that the protective film is provided on the phosphor layer via an adhesive layer, the scattering of stimulating rays occurs on each interface among the phosphor layer, adhesive layer and protective film. Thus, the quality of the resulting image is apt to be deteriorated. Further, the efficiency in the detection of light emitted by the phosphor on the side of the panel surface surface of the protective film is reduced because the emitted light is also scattered on the interface s , so that the sensitivity of the panel decreases. The radiation image storage panel is generally used repeatedly. When the protective film is provided on the phosphor layer via an adhesive layer, the adhesive layer tends to mechanically or thermochemically deteriorate as the use of the panel is repeated. As a result, the protective film has a tendency of peeling off the panel. In other words, the bonding strength is not sufficient between the phosphor layer and the protective film and the panel is not sufficiently resistant to the repeated use. More in detail, the radiation image storage panel is repeatedly used in a cyclic procedure comprising steps of exposing the panel to a radiation recording a radiation image thereon , irradiating the panel with stimulating rays reading out the recorded radiation image therefrom and irradiating the panel with light for erasure erasing the remaining radiation image therefrom . The panel is transferred to the subsequent step through a transfer system and piled on other panels to be stored after one cycle is finished. The radiation image storage panel is furthermore apt to be charged on its surface because the contact and friction between panels repeatedly take place in the continuous cycle comprising transfering and piling of the panel. The static electrification on the panel brings about the adhesion with another panel to transfer two panels together in layers from the piling into the transfer system, whereby the subsequent procedure cannot be normally conducted. The charged surface of the panel is likely to be attached with dust in the air, so that the stimulating rays are also scattered on the dust attached thereon and the quality of the resulting image lowers. EP A 0118880 published on September 19, 1984 discloses a radiation image storage panel comprising a support and phosphor layers provided thereon wherein said phosphor layers include at least two layers of the first phosphor layer provided on the support and the second phosphor layer provided on the side nearer to the front surface of the panel than said first phosphor layer. EP A 0103302 discloses a radiographic intensifying screen comprising a support, phosphor layers and a protective film in which said phosphor layers comprise It is the object of the present invention to provide a radiation image storage panel having an improved mechanical strength and quality of an image provided thereby. Said object is accomplished by a radiation image storage panel comprising a support and a phosphor layer provided thereon which comprises a binder and a stimulable phosphor dispersed therein, characterized in that said phosphor layer consists essentially of one part on the support side which contains the stimulable phosphor and the other part on the panel surface side which does not substantially contain the stimulable phosphor. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of such a radiation image storage panel which comprises simultaneously applying a binder solution I containing a stimulable phosphor dispersed therein and a binder solution II containing no stimulable phosphor onto a surface of a support, in such a superposing manner that the binder solution II is arranged on the the binder solution II, and 2 a process for the preparation of a radiation image storage panel which comprises simultaneously applying a binder solution I containing a stimulable phosphor dispersed therein and a binder solution II containing no stimulable phosphor onto a plane sheet, in such a superposing manner that the binder solution II is arranged on the binder solution II to form one or two layers and separating the one or two layers from the sheet and providing the layers on a support. In the present specification, the term panel surface side of the phosphor layer means the side opposite to the side facing the support thereof. It is preferred to introduce an Fig. 1 schematically shows a sectional view of a two hopper type coating apparatus, which is an example of the coating apparatus employable in the process for the preparation of a radiation image storage panel according to the present invention. Fig. 2 is a photograph showing a partial section of the phosphor layer observed by using a scanning electron microscope, with respect to the radiation image storage panel according to the present invention. The present invention achieves the noticeable improvement in various characteristics of the radiation image storage panel such as the mechanical strength, the quality of the image provided thereby and the sensitivity by forming a phosphor layer or a phosphor layer and a protective film on a support by means of a simultaneous superposition coating method. A phosphor layer is conventionally prepared by applying a binder solution containing phosphor particles homogeneously dispersed therein namely, a coating dispersion onto a support using a known method. The phosphor particles are uniformly dispersed in the whole phosphor layer with the binder. Then, a protective film is provided by combining the phosphor layer with a transparent thin film made of polymer such as polyethylene terephthalate by an adhesive agent. In the present invention, a binder solution I containing phosphor particles and a binder solution II not containing phosphor particles are simultaneously applied manner onto a support or onto another plane sheet in such a superposing manner that the binder solution II is arranged on the binder solution II. In the case that the binder in the binder solution I is compatible with the binder in the binder solution II, the simultaneous superposition coating according to the invention brings about the formation of a single phosphor layer consisting of two parts along the direction of the depth of the phosphor layer, one part being positioned on the support side and containing phosphor particles, and the other part being positioned on the panel surface side and substantially not containing phosphor particles. That is, the stimulable phosphor particles are contained only in the specific region on the support side of the phosphor layer and not contained in the other region on the panel surface side of the phosphor layer, and the phosphor layer has a smooth surface. Accordingly, the panel surface side part containing no phosphor particles can serve as a protective film for keeping the phosphor from chemical or physical deterioration, that is, the phosphor layer is useful not only In the case that the binders in the binder solutions I and II are incompatible with each other, the simultaneous superposition coating according to the invention brings about the simultaneous formation of two layers consisting of a phosphor layer and a protective film. According to the invention, it is not necessary to further provide a protective film on the phosphor layer, which is different from the conventional process for the preparation of a radiation image storage panel, and the process can be simplified. In the process of the invention, both layers of the binder solutions I and II are simultaneously heated to dryness to form a single continuous layer which serves as a phosphor layer and a protective film , or to form a phosphor layer and a protective film, so that the bonding strength between the phosphor layer and the protective film can be enhanced and the peeling of the protective film due to the deteriorated adhesive layer can be prevented. particularly. in the former case wherein the binders compatible with each other are employed in the solutions I and Il to form a single phosphor layer, there hardly occurs such a trouble that the protective film is separated from the phosphor layer owing to the low bonding strength therebetween. Further, since an additional interface between the phosphor layer and the protective film which is given by the provision of an adhesive layer is not formed in the radiation image storage panel of the invention, the scattering of stimulating rays is more reduced than that in the conventional panel and the image provided thereby is improved in the quality such as sharpness and graininess. The sensitivity of the panel is enhanced as well as the image quality, because light emitted by the phosphor is also less scattered. Especially, the panel having a single phosphor layer given in the former case has no interface between the phosphor layer and the protective layer, so that the scattering of the stimulating rays and the emitted light on said interface does not take place and the image quality and the sensitivity are remarkably enhanced. In a conventional radiation image storage panel, dust is apt to be introduced into the area between the phosphor layer and the protective film in the procedure of providing laminating the protective film, and therefore careful attention is required. Such problem does not occur in the present invention, whereby an image of high quality is easily obtained. Furthermore, the static electrification phenomenon of the surface of the radiation image storage panel which occurs during the transfer system for recording and reading out the panel is prevented by introducing the antistatic agent of an inorganic salt of metal into the binder solution II in the process for the preparation thereof. That is, the antistatic agent is dispersed on the panel surface side of the phosphor layer or on the surface of the protective film in the panel of the present invention. The presence of the antistatic agent on the surface of the panel effectively prevents the panel from being charged and brings about the smooth transfering of the panel in the system, so that satisfactory recording and reproducing of the radiation image are achieved. The radiation image storage panel of the present invention having the above described advantages can be prepared, for instance, in the following manner. The phosphor layer basically comprises a binder and stimulable phosphor particles dispersed therein. The stimulable phosphor, as described hereinbefore, gives stimulated emission when excited with stimulating rays after exposure to a radiation. From the viewpoint of practical use, the stimulable phosphor is desired to give stimulated emission in the wavelength region of 300 500 nm when excited with stimulating rays in the wavelength region of 400 900 nm. Examples of the stimulable phosphor employable in the radiation image storage panel of the present invention include SrS Ce,Sm, SrS Eu,Sm, ThO₂ Er, and La₂O₂S Eu,Sm, as described in U.S. A 3,859,527 ZnS Cu,Pb, BaO xAℓ₂O₃ Eu, in which Ba LnOX xA, in which Ln is at least one element selected from the group consisting of La, Y, Gd and Lu, X is at least one element selected from the group consisting of Cℓ and Br, A is at least one element selected from the group consisting of Ce and Tb, and Ba M Ba Ba Ba M Ba BaFX xA yEu² BaFX xA yEu² BaFX xNaX aEu² M M M M The above mentioned M bM bKX cMgX ₂ dM bA, in which A is at least one oxide selected from the group consisting of SiO₂ and P₂O₅ and Among the above described stimulable phosphors, the divalent europium activated alkaline earth metal halide phosphor and rare earth element acitivated rare earth oxyhalide phosphor are particularly preferred, because these show stimulated emission of high luminance. The above described stimulable phosphors are given by no means to restrict the stimulable phosphor employable in the present invention. Any other phosphors can be employed, provided that the phosphor gives stimulated emission when excited with stimulating rays after exposure to a radiation. Examples of the binder to be contained in the phosphor layer include natural polymers such as proteins e.g. gelatin , polysaccharides e.g. dextran and gum arabic and synthetic polymers such is polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl acetate, nitrocellulose, ethylcellulose, vinylidene chloride vinyl chloride copolymer, polyalkyl meth acrylate, vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer, polyurethane, cellulose acetate butyrate, polyvinyl alcohol and linear polyester. Particularly preferred are nitrocellulose, linear polyester, polyalkyl meth acrylate, a mixture of nitrocellulose and linear polyester, and a mixture of nitrocellulose and polyalkyl meth acrylate. These binders may be crosslinked with a crosslinking agent. The phosphor layer or the phosphor layer together with the protective film can be formed on the support, for instance, by the following procedure. In the first place, stimulable phosphor particles and a binder are added to an appropriate solvent, and then they are mixed to prepare a coating dispersion I comprising the phosphor particles homogeneously dispersed in the binder solution. Examples of the solvent employable in the preparation of the coating dispersion include lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n propanol and n butanol chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride and ethylene chloride ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone esters of lower alcohols with lower aliphatic acids such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and butyl acetate ethers such as dioxane, ethylene glycol monoethylether and ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and mixtures of the above mentioned compounds. The ratio between the binder and the stimulable phosphor in the coating dispersion may be determined according to the characteristics of the aimed radiation image storage panel and the nature of the phosphor employed. Generally, the ratio therebetween is within the range of from 1 1 to 1 100 binder phosphor, by weight , preferably from 1 8 to 1 40. The coating dispersion may contain a dispersing agent to improve the dispersibility of the phosphor particles therein, and may contain a variety of additives such as a plasticizer for increasing the bonding between the binder and the phosphor particles in the phosphor layer. Examples of the dispersing agent include phthalic acid, stearic acid, caproic acid and a hydrophobic surface active agent. Examples of the plasticizer include phosphates such as triphenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate and diphenyl phosphate phthalates much as diethyl phthalate and dimethoxyethyl phthalate glycolates such as ethylphthalyl ethyl glycolate and butylphthalyl butyl glycolate and polyesters of polyethylene glycols with aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as polyester of triethylene glycol with adipic acid and polyester of diethylene glycol with succinic acid. The coating dispersion may further contain such a colorant that the mean reflectance thereof in the wavelength region of stimulating rays for the stimulable phosphor is lower than the mean reflectance thereof in the wavelength region of light emitted by the stimulable phosphor upon stimulation thereof, to enhance the sharpness of an image provided by the resulting panel. Examples of the colorant include those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,394,581 and U.S. Patent Application No. 326,642. The coating dispersion may contain a white powder as described in U.S. A 4,350,893 for the same purpose. In the second place, only a binder is added to an appropriate solvent and they are mixed to prepare a coating solution II. Examples of the binder employable for the preparation of the coating solution II include cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polyvinyl formal, melamine, a phenol resin and an epoxy resin, as well as the above mentioned binders. When forming a single phosphor layer also serving as a protective film, the binder employable in the coating solution II may be the same as that employed in the coating dispersion I or quite different therefrom, provided that both binders are compatible with each other. From the viewpoint of the physical strength such as resistance to damage of the surface of the radiation image storage panel, the binder of the coating solution II is preferred to be relatively rigid. From the viewpoint of the mechanical strength of the panel, the binder of the coating solution II is preferably the same as that of the coating dispersion I. When forming two layers of a phosphor layer and a protective film, the binder employable in the coating solution II is required to be substantially incompatible with that used in the coating dispersion I. For example, when some kinds of binders are employed together, it is not necessary that each of the binders is incompatible with the binder of the coating dispersion I, but that as a whole the binders are non compatible therewith. From the viewpoint of the physical strength of the panel surface, the binder of the coating solution II is preferred to be relatively rigid. As the solvent employable for the coating solution II, there can be employed the above mentioned solvents, and the solvent of the coating solution II may be the same or different from the solvent employed in the coating dispersion I. Both solvents employed in the coating solution II and the coating dispersion I are desired to be miscible with each other in order to dry superposed layers of the coating solution II and the coating dipersion II at the same speed. The coating solution II may contain a variety of additives such as a dispersing agent, a plasticizer and a colorant as employed for the coating dispersion I. Further, the coanting solution II may contain an antistatic agent in order to prevent the static electrification of the surface of the panel. The antistatic agent employable in the invention is an inorganic salt of a metal. The introduction of the inorganic salt of a metal enables electric charge on the panel to be easily transferred outside statically discharged , whereby the static electrification of the panel is prevented. Namely, the electrical resistance of surface of the panel can be decreased. Representative examples of the inorganic salt of a metal employable for the antistatic agent include LiCℓ, NaCℓ, NaBr, NaI, NaNO₃ Na₃PO₄, CsI, MgBr₂, BaBr₂, BaI₂ and AℓBr₃. These metal inorganic salts may be in the state of an anhydride or of a compound containing water of crystallization, provided that the metal salt is stable at room temperature. Among the metal salts, preferred are LiCℓ, NaBr, NaI, NaNO₃, MgBr₂ and AℓBr₃. From the viewpoint of colorlessness and high solubility in solvents such as water and alcohol, particularly preferred are LiCℓ, NaBr, and MgBr₂. These metal salts are colorless as not to absorb stimulating rays and soluble in the binder solution as to be uniformly dispersed on the surface of the resulting phosphor layer or protective film . The amount of the antistatic agent to be contained in the coating solution II varies depending on the kind thereof, the kind of the binder and the characteristics of the radiation image storage panel. Generally, the antistatic agent is contained in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 20 by weight of the binder of the coating solution II, and preferably from 0.5 to 5 . Namely, the amount of the antistatic agent is generally within the range of from 0.03 to 6 by weight of both binders of the coating dispersion I and the coating solution II, and preferably from 0.1 to 2 . In this case, a solvent in which the antistatic agent of metal inorganic salt is dis solved is preferably employed for increasing the dispersibility thereof in the resulting layer. The coating dispersion I and the coating solution II are evenly applied on the surface of a support in simultaneous stage and in the superposed form, in such a manner that the coating dispersion I is arranged to be placed on the support side to form layers of the coating dispersion and the coating solution. The applying procedure is conducted, for instance, by using a two hopper type coating apparatus. The ratio between the coating amount of the dispersion I and the coating amount of the solution II varies depending on the characteristics of the aimed radiation image storage panel, the viscosity of the coating dispersion and coating solution and the ratio between the binder and the phosphor. Generally, the ratio therebetween is within the range of from 100 1 to 1 1 dispersion I solution II, in volume , preferably from 10 1 to 1 After applying the coating dispersion I and the coating solution II to the support, the coating solution II on the support side and the coating dispersion I provided thereon are then slowly heated to dryness so as to complete the formation of one layer namely, a single phosphor layer or two layers namely, a phosphor layer and a protective film . When both the binders of the coating dispersion I and the coating solution II are compatible with each other, the formed single phosphor layer comprises two parts, one of which is arranged on the support side and contains phosphor particles dispersed in the binder and the other of which is arranged on the panel surface side and substantially contains no phosphor particles. It is confirmed that no interface between these two parts is visually observed with an electron microscope and the phosphor layer is in the form of a single layer. On the other hand, when both the binders of the coating dispersion I and the coating solution II are incompatible with each other, the phosphor layer is formed on the support and further the protective film is formed on the phosphor layer. The single phosphor layer or the phosphor layer together with the protective film can be provided on the support by methods other than that given in the above. For instance, one or two layers are initially prepared on a plane sheet false support such as a glass plate, metal plate or plastic sheet by simultaneously applying both the coating dispersion and solution in the superposed form thereon in the above mentioned manner, and then the prepared one or two layers are superposed on the genuine support by pressing or using an adhesive agent. In this case, It is preferable to arrange the coating dispersion I on the plane sheet side. On the contrary, it is also possible to arrange the coating solution II on the plane sheet side. Thus, a single phosphor layer is provided on the support wherein the part corresponding to the coating dispersion I faces the support, or the phosphor layer and the protective film are provided on the support wherein the phosphor layer faces the support. Alternatively, if the phoshor layer is self supporting, it is not necessary to provide the support. The thickness of the phosphor layer varies depending upon the characteristics of the aimed radiation image storage panel, the nature of the phosphor and the ratio between the binder and the phosphor. Generally, the thickness of the phosphor layer is within the range of from 20 µm to 1 mm, and preferably from 50 to 500 µm. When the phosphor layer comprises the above mentioned two parts, the thickness of the panel surface side part substantially containing no stimulable phosphor is preferably within the range of from 3 to 20 µm. The ratio between the support side part containing the stimulable phosphor and the panel surface side part containing no stimulable phosphor is preferably within the range of from 100 1 to 5 1, in thickness. When the protective film is provided together with the phosphor layer, the thickness of the protective film is preferably within the range of from 3 to 20 µm. The ratio between the thickness of the phosphor layer and the thickness of the protective film is preferably within the range of from 100 1 to 5 1. The support material employed in the present invention can be selected from those employed in conventional radiographic intensifying screens or those employed in known radiation image storage panels. Examples of the support material include plastic films such as films of cellulose acetate, polyester, polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide, polyimide, triacetate and polycarbonate metal sheets such as aluminum foil and aluminum alloy foil ordinary papers baryta paper resin coated papers pigment papers containing for example titanium dioxide and papers for example sized with polyvinyl alcohol. From the viewpoint of characteristics of a radiation image storage panel as an information recording material, a plastic film is preferably employed as the support material of the invention. The plastic film may contain a light absorbing material such as carbon black, or may contain a light reflecting material such as titanium dioxide. The former is appropriate for preparing a high sharpness type radiation image storage panel, while the latter is appropriate for preparing a high sensitivity type radiation image storage panel. In the preparation of a known radiation image storage panel, one or more additional layers are occasionally provided between the support and the phosphor layer, so as to enhance the adhesion between the support and the phosphor layer, or to improve the sensitivity of the panel or the quality of an image sharpness and graini ness provided thereby. For instance, a subbing layer may be provided by coating a polymer material such as gelatin over the surface of the support on the phosphor layer side. Otherwise, a light reflecting layer or a light absorbing layer may be provided by forming a polymer material layer containing a light reflecting material such as titanium dioxide or a light absorbing material such as carbon black. In the invention, one or more of these additional layers may be provided on the support. As described in U.S. A 496,278, the phosphor layer side surface of the support or the surface of a subbing layer, light reflecting layer, or light absorbing layer in the case that such layers are provided on the phosphor layer may be provided with protruded and depressed parts for enhancement of the sharpness of the image. The following examples further illustrate the present invention. In these examples, the term part s means part s by weight , unless specifically mentioned. To a mixture of methyl ethyl ketone and isopropyl alcohol were added a polyurethane resin Desmolac 4125, available from Sumitomo Bayer Urethane Co., Ltd. , nitrocellulose RS 120, available from Daicel Co., Ltd. and tricresyl phosphate. The mixture was stirred by means of a propeller agitator to prepare a binder solution coating solution II . Subsequently, to the coating solution II were added divalent europium activated barium fluorobromide BaFBr Eu² The coating dispersion I and the coating solution II had the following composition. The coating dispersion I and the coating solution II were simultaneously applied in a superposing manner on a polyethylene terephthalate sheet containing carbon black support, thickness 250 µm placed horizontally on a glass plate using a two hopper type coating apparatus as shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, the coating dispersion I was introduced into the right guiding part 2 of the two hopper type coating apparatus 1, and the coating solution II was introduced into the left guiding part 3. The width of the openings of the guiding parts 2 and 3 was 0.500 mm and 0.150 mm, respectively. The coating dispersion I and the coating solution II were simultaneouly applied in a superposing manner on the support 5, moving the glass plate 4 having the support 5 placed thereon along the direction of indicated arrow 8 at a rate of 1.0 m min to form a layer 6 of the coating dispersion I and a layer 7 of the coating solution II. After the coating was complete, the support having the coating dispersion I and the coating solution II was placed in an oven and heated at a temperature gradually rising from 25 to 100 C for 50 min , to form a phosphor layer on the support. Thus, a radiation image storage panel consisting of a support and a phosphor layer was prepared. The sectional photograph of the phosphor layer of the radiation image storage panel was obtained using a scanning electron microscope, which is shown in Fig. 2. As is evident from the sectional photograph shown in Fig. 2, the phosphor layer formed by a simultaneous superposition coating comprised two parts one part on the support side contained the phosphor particles with high density and the other part on the panel surface side did not substantially contain the phosphor particles. Further, said two parts are formed continuously and there was no interface between the two parts. It was confirmed from the sectional photograph that the thickness of the part containing the phosphor particles on the support side was approx. 350 µm and the thickness of the other part substantially containing no phosphor particles on the panel surface side was approx. 7 µm. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that only the coating dispersion I was applied onto the support using only the guiding part 2 of the two hopper type coating apparatus width of the opening 0.500 mm to form a phosphor layer having the thickness of approx. 350 µm on the support. On the phosphor layer was placed a transparent polyethylene terephthalate film protective film, thickness 7 µm, provided with a polyester adhesive layer on the surface , and the transparent film was pressed using a heating roll at a temperature of 90 100 C to combine the phosphor layer with the protective film. Thus, a radiation image storage panel consisting essentially of a support, a phosphor layer and a transparent protective film was prepared. The radiation image storage panels prepared in Example 1 and Comparison Example 1 were evaluated on the sharpness and the graininess of the image provided thereby, the sensitivity thereof, and the bonding strength thereof according to the following tests. The radiation image storage panel was exposed to X rays at a voltage of 80 KV through an MTF chart and subsequently scanned with a He Ne laser beam wavelength 632.8 nm to excite the phosphor particles contained in the panel. The light emitted by the phosphor layer of the panel was detected and converted to electric signals by means of a photosensor photomultiplier having spectral sensitivity of type S 5 . From the electric signals a radiation image of the MTF chart was reproduced as a visible image by an image reproducing apparatus, and the modulation transfer function MTF value of the visible image was determined. The MTF value was given as a value at the spatial frequency of 2 cycle mm. The radiation image storage panel was exposed to X rays at a voltage of 8O KV and at a dose of 10 mR, and subsequently scanned with the He Ne laser beam to excite the phosphor particles contained in the panel. The light emitted by the phosphor layer of the panel was detected and converted to electric signals by means of the photosensor. The electric signals were reproduced and recorded on an ordinary photographic film by means of a film scanner and the RMS value of the visible image on the film was determined. The RMS value was given as a value at the photographic density of D 1.2 and the spatial frequency of 0.4 5 cycle mm. The radiation image storage panel was exposed to X rays at a voltage of 80 KV and subsequently excited with the He Ne laser beam to measure the sensitivity thereof. The radiation image storage panel was cut to give a test strip having a width of 100 mm and the test strip was given a notch in the vicinity of the border between the part containing the phosphor particles and the part not containing the phosphor particles or along the interface between the phosphor layer and the protective film . In a tensile testing machine Tensilon UTM II 20, manufactured by Toyo Baldwin Co., Ltd. , the part not containing the phosphor particles and the part containing the phosphor particles or the protective film part and the phosphor layer part of the so notched test strip were forced to separate from each other by pulling both parts along the rectangular direction peel angle 90 at a rate of 10 mm min. The bonding strength was determined just when the part not containing the phosphor particles or protective film part was peeled from the other part in the length of 10 mm. The strength peel strength is expressed in terms of the force F g cm . The results on the evaulation are shown in Table 1. As is evident from Table 1, the radiation image storage panel of the present invention Example 1 was noticeably enhanced in the sensitivity and the bonding strength, and provided an image of high sharpness and graininess, compared with the conventional radiation image storage panel Comparison Example 1 . The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except for using a polyacrylic resin Criscoat P 1018GS, available from Dainippon Ink Chemicals Inc. as a binder instead of a polyurethane resin and using no isopropyl alcohol as a solvent, to prepare a coating dispersion I and a coating solution II having the following composition. Subsequently, the procedure of Example 1 was repeated except for using the above coating dispersion I and coating solution II and setting the opening width of the two guiding parts in the two hopper type coating apparatus at 0.450 mm and 0.120 mm, respectively, to prepare a radiation image storage panel consisting of a support and a phosphor layer.
