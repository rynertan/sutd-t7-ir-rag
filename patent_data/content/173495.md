# IMPROVEMENTS IN SELF ENERGISING DISC BRAKES

## Abstract
In a self energising disc brake of the spreading type the re cesses 40 in the pressure plates 5, 6 in which the balls 8 are housed, are machined directly into the material of the plates on pitch circles in the two plates of corresponding diameters. Each recess comprises an inclined ramp surface 41 terminat ing at opposite ends in first and second portions 43, 44 of which the end portion 43 at the deeper end is engaged by the ball 8 in off position of brake, and the second portion 44 is engaged by the ball 8 to preclude further relative angular movement between the plates 5, 6 in a brake applying direc tion, thereby indicating a wear stop . In addition ramp sur faces 41, 42 of different slopes may be located between the end portions 43, 44 so that an increased brake applying ef fort towards a fully worn lining condition provides a wear warn ing device.
