# Wire laying tool.

## Abstract
A wire laying tool has a central passageway 2 terminating in a probe 7 which can be retracted relative to a stem 6 against the force of a spring 17 by means of a piston 15 movable in a chamber 16. A spring loaded pawl is actuated by another piston 29 movable in a chamber 26. The pawl can advance the wire in the pas sageway and probe forwardly of the front end 9 of the tool. When the piston 29 has almost completed its stroke, fluid pressure is communicated to the chamber 16 to cause retraction of the probe 7. A spring loaded dog 45 acts as a brake for wire in the passageway. The tool is intended for use in the production of wiring harnesses with the aid of a robot manipulator.
