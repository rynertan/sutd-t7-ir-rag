# HYDRAULICALLY ELEVATABLE ACCESS EQUIPMENT

## Abstract
Access equpment including a vehicle 10 on which stands a mast 14 movable between horizontal and vertical positions and mounted for rotation about an axis 13 . The mast is telescopically extendibie and carries a pivoted boom 17 which is also telescopically extendible and carries a further boom 19 with a working platform 20 thereon. Booms 17, 19 can operate only when the mast 14 is vertical. A cable system maintains platform 20 level for all positions of booms 17,19 and at least two sets of conduits extend from the vehicle 10 to the platform 20 . A take up system for maintaining the conduits taut is located in casing 54 attached to mast 14 and includes sets of rollers 61 to 69 for supporting the conduits around curved paths and preventing them from becoming entangled.
