# ANAMORPHIC PRISM FOR BEAM SHAPING

## Abstract
A device for shaping a beam of light comprising a single anamorphic prism 10 having an input face 26 for receiving a beam of light, and an output face 30 for outputting the beam of light. A reflecting face 28 reflects light from the input face 26 to the output face 30 . The faces 26, 30 are oriented to cause the beam exiting the output face 30 to be substantially parallel to the beam entering the input face 26 . The prism 10 is sized to provide colinearity of the input and output light.
