## Description
COMPOSITIONS IN POWDER FORM CONTAINING PESTICIDES AND SUITABLE FOR TREATMENT OF HOUSEHOLD FURNISHINGS TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to compositions for use in the control of arthropods, such as ticks, fleas, silver fish, and cockroaches, in household furnishings by the application thereto of an appropriate pesticidal agent. More particularly, this invention relates to novel compositions in powder form which contain a pesticidal agent and which may be readily applied to and removed from household furnishings, such as upholstery, floors and floor coverings such as carpets and rugs.BACKGROUND ART Heretofore, pesticidal type agents have been used in the treatment of carpets, fabrics, upholstery, and the like, to permanently treat such material for protection of the material against deleterious agents such as fungi, mould, and insects. Powdered compositions for treating carpets to provide deodorizing and or freshening effects thereto are also known. U.S. Patent No. 2,119,458 provides a process for fixing or depositing certain water insoluble insecticides to material such as carpets, rugs, paper, woollen goods or furs in order to provide life long protection to the material so treated. U.S. Patent No. 3,122,502 provides a softenergermicide liquid preparation for the treatment of and protection of fabrics. U.S. Patent No. 3,134,738 discloses the treatment of rugs, fabrics, and the like, with cleaning solutions containing insecticides or pesticides to prevent attack on the material by moths or the like in addition to cleaning the material so treated. U.S. Patent No. 3,230,141 provides for the treatment of keratin fibres with certain insecticides and bactericides to provide permanent protection against damage from moths, beetles and the like. U.S. Patent No. 3,317,372 provides for the treatment of rugs, upholstery, fabrics and the like with bactericidal and fungicidal agents to prevent formation of odoriferous products by fungi and moulds. U.S. Patent No. 4,161,449 provides powdered carpet compositions comprising a carrier, an agglomerating agent and a fragrance in a form for ready application to the carpet to provide deodorizing and or freshening effects thereto.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION This invention provides a novel composition in powder form for the control of arthropods, such as fleas, ticks, centipedes, ants, cockroaches and other crawling insects, in household furnishings, such as floors, upholstery, floor coverings such as carpets and rugs. The powdered composition comprises an inorganic salt carrier, an agglomerating agent and a pesticide.Other optional ingredients such as fragrances, antistatic agents, deodorizers and anti soiling agents may be conveniently included in the compositions. The compositions may be used to control such arthropods by sprinkling the compositions on the fabric floor covering, allowing it to remain for a period of time necessary to kill any arthropods present, usually a period of 12 to 120 minutes, and then removing the compositions and arthropods by vacuuming the treated area. The inorganic salt carrier will normally be present in the composition in an amount of from about 30 to 95 percent by weight and preferably in an amount of from about 75 to 90 percent by weight. The carrier is selected from inorganic salts such as sulphate, bicarbonates, borates, chlorides, citrates, phosphates and nitrates and combinations thereof. The preferred carriers are the sodium salts of the sulphates and bicarbonates and combinations thereof. Aluminium, calcium, magnesium and other metal salts may also be used. It is necessary that the carrier be capable of existing in agglomerated form to assist in the application of the composition on the floor covering surface without excessive dusting and to provide for even distribution of the composition thereon and the subsequent removal thereof.In order to provide the above discussed characteristics to the compositions, the particle size of the carrier should be such that substantially all of the particles fall within the range of about 0.075 to 0.475 mm. The agglomerating agent is necessary in the compositions in order to assure the agglomeration of the particles to provide the necessary characteristics to achieve the purpose desired i.e. the compositions must remain in the area of dontact on the floor covering and be of a nature that will allow the particles to sit on top of the fabric or fibres for ready removal therefrom. The agglomerating agent will be present in the composition in an amount of from about 1.0 to about 20.0 percent by weight and preferably in an amount of from about 4.5 to about 10.0 percent by weight. Agglomerating agents which may be conveniently used for the purposes of this invention include starch, talc, clay, silica powders, grain flours and wood flours. Starch is the preferred agglomerating agent suitable for use in the compositions of this invention. The pesticidal agent which is the critical component of the compositions of this invention may be selected from any conventional pesticidal agent which is capable of controlling and killing arthropods such as might be found in fabric floor coverings. The pesticidal agent is present in the composition in an amount of from about 0.05 to about 7.5 percent by weight and preferably in an amount of from about 0.10 to about 6.0 percent by weight. Pesticidal agents which may conveniently be used for the purposes of this invention include organophosphates, thiophosphates, carbamates, synthetic pyrethoids, and natural pyrethrums. Combinations of two or more pesticidal agents may also be used for the purpose of this invention.Illustrative of suitable pesticidal agents are chlorinated hydrocarbons, non volatile carbamates such as l naphthyl N methylcarbamate, and 2 isormoxyphenyl N methylcarbamate pyrethrins derived from flowers of pyrethrins cineraefolium and comprising esters of pyrethrolone and chrysanthemic and pyrethroic acids, esters of cinerolone and chrysanthemic and pyrethroic acids, and esters of jasmoline and chrysanthemin and pyrethroic acids 3 phenoxyphenyl methyl cis, trans 3 2,2 dichloro ethenyl 2, 2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate 3 phenoxybenzyl d cis, trans 2,2 dimethyl 3 2 methylpropenyl cyclopropanecarboxylate l cyclohexane 1,2 dicarboxi mido methyl 2,2 dimethyl 3 2 methyl propenyl cyclopropane carboxylate phosphates such as 2 chloro 1 2, 4,5 trichlorophenyl vinyl dimethylphosphate, dimethyl1,2 dibrom 2,2 dichloroethyl phosphate, and dimethyl 2,2 dichlorovinyl phosphate, and piperonyl butoxide. It is preferred that the pesticidal agent be a liquid which is absorbed by the solid components of the composition to provide improved results when applied to the surface being treated therewith. In addition to the three essential components of the compositions of this invention, other conventional ingredients may be included if desired. Such ingredients include fragrances, anti static agents, antisoiling agents, and deodorizers. The compositions of this invention may be prepared using any conventional blending technique. Preferably, the pesticidal agent will be blended with a portion of the carrier, up to about 50 by weight thereof, and then this mixture will be mixed with the remaining amount of carrier, agglomerating agent and any optional additives desired.BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The invention may be put into practice in various ways and a number of specific embodiments will be described to illustrate the invention with reference to the accompanying Examples.
