# Collimator sight.

## Abstract
A sight for a firearm or other article which is intended to be aimed at a target or the like comprises a collimator 1 which is mounted for universal pivotal movement on a mount 8 which in turn is mounted on an adaptor 10 adapted to mount the sight on a firearm or other article. the collimator 1 contains a light unit 14 located at the front end of the collimator and arranged to emit a light spot towards the rear of the collimator which has an opening covered by a transparent lens 36 . The light unit 14 is surrounded by a transparent casing 18 which extends in front of the collimator 1 and which has a closed end through which extends a jack pin 19 . The pin 19 extends into a chamber in a housing 9 projecting from the mount 8 and provided with adjusting screws for adjusting the angular position of the collimator 1 relative to the mount 8 . A locking screw 25 is provided for locking the collimator 1 in position once a desired adjustment has been achieved. In use, an observer looks into the sight with one eye while viewing the whole target area with the other eye. The light spot from the sight will appear to the observer to be superimposed on a target and he can use this spot for aiming the firearm or other article at the target.
