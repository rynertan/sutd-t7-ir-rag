## Description
THIS INVENTION relates to quinazoline derivatives which are potent anti tumour anti cancer agents. The majority of the drugs which have been used to treat tumours have interfered either directly or indirectly with the replication of nucleic acids in the dividing cells. Many agents, termed antimetabolites, are designed to kill the tumour by depleting its essential growth elements in competing with and displacing the substrates of specific enzymes involved in DNA synthesis. Antimetabolites can be classified according to their specific inhibitory action and examples include analogues of purines and pyrimidines and folic acid antagonists such as aminopterin and amethopterin methotrexate . Of the antimetabolites which are folic acid antagonists, methotrexate is used widely in the treatment of human malignant disease, particularly in the treatment of choriocarcinoma and osteosarcoma and in the maintenance therapy of acute lymphatic leukaemia. Its inhibition of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase DHFR, EC 1.5.1.4 causes a depletion of the one carbon carrying tetrahydrofolate pools, resulting in the inhibition of the There is therefore a requirement for an agent which competes with the tetrahydrofolate cosubstrate of TS rather than the pyrimidine substrate, since such a compound may be expected to have activity equal or superior to methotrexate not only in methotrexate sensitive tumours, but also in those resistant by virtue of raised cellular DHFR. It should also be less toxic to the host since the synthesis of purines would not be affected. Further, folate analogues should be more effective than pyrimidines since they do not require metabolic activation. Several classical quinazoline antifolates have been shown to be inhibitors of TS, e.g. 2 amino 4 hydroxy and 2,4 diamino derivatives, though while these latter have been shown to be reasonably effective inhibitors of TS they also bind extremely tightly to DHFR. GB 2,065,653 B describes quinazolines of the formula A wherein R represents One of the more potent compounds of formula A which shows considerable promise in clinical use is N 4 N 2 amino 4 hydroxy 6 quinazolyl methyl prop 2 ynylamino benzoyl L glutamic acid also known as N¹⁰ propargyl 5,8 dideazafolic acid and known under the code CB3717. Analogues of 5,8 dideazafolic acid possessing various N¹⁰ substituents of formula A have previously been shown to be good inhibitors of thymidylate synthase TS , the terminal enzyme in the The most potent of these, N¹⁰ propargyl 5,8 dideazafolic acid CB3717 was found to be active against L1210 cells grown either In both mouse and man toxicity is observed to the liver and kidney. The former toxicity is manifested as a transient rise in alanine transaminase accompanied by a feeling of malaise and the latter as a rise in plasma urea mouse or a fall in glomerular filtration rate GFR man . Several minor and partial responses have been noted during the Phase I II clinical studies particularly breast and ovary . Thus CB3717 possesses anti tumour properties in man but its use is hindered by the apparently non dose related although not life threatening hepatic toxicity. A role therefore exists for a second generation antifolate that is devoid of such toxic side effects whilst retaining the essential characteristics for good tumour inhibition. However, although poor solubility of CB3717 at acid pH most probably accounts for renal toxicity, no clue as to the cause of the hepatic toxicity has been forthcoming. Thus chemical synthpsis,although rational in terms of seeking another potent TS inhibitor, has had to be empirical in the search for a non hepato toxic compound. We have now discovered a new class of analogues Of 5,8 dideazafolic acid which retain valuable TS inhibitory properties but which exhibit reduced hepatic toxicity compared to that of CB3717 and related compounds of formula A. Accordingly the present invention provides compounds of the general formula I wherein R represents The compounds of the present invention are useful as anti cancer agents which are either active as such or are suitable as pro drugs which can be converted Preferred substituents R as defined under 2 in formula I are straight or branched chains containing 2 6 e.g., 4 and particularly 2 or 3, carbon atoms and especially those having unsaturation at least in the 2 or in the ω position. Examples of such groups are alkenyl, alkadienyl, alkynyl and alkadiynyl groups and particular examples are vinyl, allyl, propenyl, propargyl, but 2 ynyl, but 3 ynyl and 1 methylprop 2 ynyl. Examples of saturated groups R include methyl or ethyl. The groups R as defined under 3 in formula I are straight or branched chains containing up to 6 carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon chain, and particularly groups containing for instance up to a total of 3 carbon atoms in the group R as a whole. The saturated hydrocarbon chain preferably contains 1 3 carbon atoms while the unsaturated hydrocarbon chain preferably contains 2 or 3 carbon atoms. There are 1 or 2 or 3 substituent groups on the chains. Suitable heteroatom substituents are halogeno, eg. Cl or F, O and S, which can be attached to a carbon atom other than the α carbon atom. Examples of such R groups are 1 oxoethyl, 1 oxopropyl, 2 oxopropyl, formylmethyl, acryloyl, propiolyl, 2,2,2 trifluoroethyl, 2 chloro or 2 fluoroethyl, methoxymethyl and methylthiomethyl. The carbocyclic substituent groups contain 3 6 ring carbon atoms, particularly 3 5. The carbocyclic ring may itself have at least one C₁ C₄ alkyl substituent, preferably methyl, of which there are preferably 1 3, particularly 1. The substituent groups containing at least one heteroatom referred to in definition 3 of R preferably contain 1 6, particularly 1 4, heteroatoms for example halogeno, 0, N or S. Particular examples of such groups are OH, NH₂, CONH₂, COOH and salts and esters thereof, CN, NO₂, SH, methylsulphonyloxy, alkoxy and amino acid radicals. Thus, the group R as defined under 3 may be, for example, hydroxyalkyl, such as 2 hydroxyethyl or 3 hydroxypropyl, carbamoylalkyl such as carbamoylmethyl, aminoalkyl such as 2 aminoethyl, mercaptoalkyl such as 2 mercaptoethyl, cyanoalkyl such as cyanomethyl, carboxyalkyl such as carboxymethyl, alkoxycarbonylalkyl such as ethoxycarbonylmethyl, alkysulphonyloxyalkyl such as methylsulphonyloxyethyl, alkylaminoalkyl or dialkylaminoalkyl such as dimethylaminoethyl, alkoxylalkyl such as methoxymethyl alkylthioalkyl such as methylthiomethyl, haloalkyl or alkanoyl. The heteroatom containing substituent groups may also contain rings which are either carbocyclic or heterocyclic rings. A particular example of a group including a carbocyclic ring for example phenyl or naphthyl and a heteroatom is phenacyl. Alternatively, the carbocyclic ring may itself be substituted by heteroatom containing groups, preferably 1 3, e.g. which contain 1 3 heteroatoms which are 0, N or S. Particular examples are C₁ C₄ alkoxy e.g. methoxy , OH, NH₂, COOH, SH, keto, formyl and methylsulphonyloxy. Heterocyclic substituent groups preferably contain 3 to 6 ring atoms, particularly, 3,5 or 6, and the ring heteroatoms, of which there are preferably 1 3, can be N, S or O. An example of such an R group is oxiranylmethyl. These rings may be substituted by at least one C₁ C₄ alkyl group, preferably methyl, or heteroatom containing group and preferably by 1 or 2 of these groups. The substitution may be either at a ring carbon atom or heteroatom. These heteroatom containing groups preferably contain 1 3 heteroatoms, which are 0, N or S, and are for example, C₁ C₄ alkoxy e.g methoxy , 0, OH, NH₂, COOH, SH and formyl. A particular example of an R group in this category is 5 uracilylmethyl, i.e. a thyminyl group. The group X may but need not contain 1 3 heteroatoms, selected from O and N. Particular examples of such groups are C₁ C₄ alkoxy and NO₂. Other preferred groups X are halogeno eg. fluoro or chloro, and methyl. The alkyl groups in aralkyl X substituents will usually have 1 4 carbon atoms. It is usually preferred that there be only one X substituent present on the ring and that it is located in the 2 position, the CO Y group being at the 1 position. Such preferred 2 substituents are halogeno F, Cl or Br , azido or trifluoromethyl. However, there may be more than one X substituent and when X is F, preferably the substitution can be 2 ,6 difluoro. Group Z is preferably CH CH or S . Particularly potent anti cancer agents in accordance with the present invention are those where R represents propargyl, n 0 and Y represents a glutamic acid radical or a salt or ester thereof. In addition, the corresponding compounds where n 1 and X is fluoro in the 2 position show high activity. As indicated above, the present invention covers the quinazoline derivatives in the form of their free acids and also in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters of these acids, which can be partial salts and esters. Thus, in the case of the compounds containing glutamic acid and aspartic acid radicals, the mono ester mono acid and diester derivatives and corresponding salt forms are also covered. In addition, R groups containing COOH groups for example, can be in salt or ester form e.g. the ethyl ester. The salts of the present invention may be addition salts formed with physiologically acceptable inorganic or organic acids or bases, or quaternary ammonium salts but are preferably sodium salts, e.g. disodium salts. The esters are preferably lipophilic esters in which form the compound as a pro drug may be transported to the site of a non specific esterase before being degraded to the corresponding acid form. Examples of preferred esters are those with C₁ C₂₀ aliphatic groups, e.g. alkyl esters, preferably of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, especially the diethyl esters. The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by a partial or complete deprotection process carried out on a compound of formula Ia wherein X,Z and n are as defined above, R² is equivalent to R or is a group R in protected form, R Thus, for example, the acids and salts of the present invention can be prepared by complete deprotection of a compound of formula Ia, the partial esters can be prepared by deprotection of the lactam group and the R² group as necessary, with Y either already being in partial ester form or being in completely esterified form which is then partially deprotected and the full esters can be prepared by deprotection of the lactam group and the R² group as necessary, with the Y group in completely esterified form. Deprotection of the group Y in ester form to form an acid can, for example, be carried out by mild saponification using a base such as NaOH. The resultant acid may, if desired, subsequently be subjected to reaction with an acid or base to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Most preferably the acid is allowed to react with NaOH to form the corresponding disodium salt. Alternatively, an acid product can be esterified, a salt product can be converted to an acid or ester or an ester product can be trans esterified. It may be desirable to form a salt directly from an ester by the deprotection process where the compound of formula Ia is in the form of a diester, the disodium salt of the compound of formula I may be formed by saponifying the diester with 3 moles NaOH aq per mole of diester and, when this reaction is complete, adding 1 mole HCl aq per mole of diester and preferably freeze drying the product salt. The particular protecting group containing R¹ will usually be chosen having regard to the nature of the R and Y groups and the desired product, i.e. such that the conditions required to remove the R¹ group will not affect the unprotected R group and will not remove protecting ester groups in Y where these are required in the final product. An example of an R¹CO group is the pivaloyl group the pivaloyloxymethyl group being removed in a saponification step using say NaOH to remove ester groups from Y . R² is, as indicated, either equivalent to R or is a desired group R in protected form. Thus, R² in the latter instance may for example contain the group COOH in ester form, or a group OH in R² can be protected by an acid group. Examples of such groups R² are ethoxycarbonylmethyl, 2 acetoxyethyl and 3 acetoxypropyl which are deprotected to carboxymethyl, 2 hydroxyethyl and 3 hydroxypropyl, respectively. These R² groups may, however, themselves be examples of R. Another example of a protected form of R is where the substituent R² does not merely contain an extra group, but where it is in a different form from the R group and undergoes conversion as the deprotection step. An example of this is given later where an R² group 2 hydroxy 3 bromopropyl undergoes a cyclisation reaction under the saponification conditions for removing ester groups from Y and forms an oxiranylmethyl group R. The protected compound of formula Ia can itself be prepared by a coupling reaction as follows wherein R The amines of formula II above may be prepared by the direct reaction of a compound of formula R²X where R² is as defined above and X is a leaving group, preferably halogeno e.g. chloro or bromo , An alternative method for forming the amine of formula II is that of Santi see J. Heterocyclic. Chem. Where it is desired to prepare compounds of the invention containing substituents X, it is preferable to prepare first the corresponding N 4 nitrobenzoyl L glutamate, L aspartate, poly L glutamate, L 2 amino propionate or L 2 amino butyrate in protected form containing the appropriate X substituent and to convert that by hydrogenation or reduction to the corresponding 4 amino derivative which is then allowed to react with R²X to form an amine of formula II. The reactants of formula III above wherein R An alternative method for forming the protected compounds of formula Ia involves converting the N¹⁰ unsubstituted conjugated compound in lactam protected form and Y in protected form, with R²X where R² and X are as defined above in accordance with the following scheme The compound of formula Ib can itself be prepared by the following reaction wherein X is as defined above. In this reaction, instead of the 6 CH₂ X compound of formula III, it is possible to use the corresponding 6 formyl or 6 cyano compounds since the compound of formula IIa bears no R group on the amino group at this stage of the synthesis. The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a therapeutically effective amount of an anti cancer agent as defined for the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Experiments using mice having artificially implanted tumours have shown that intraperitoneal injection of anti cancer agents of the present invention can produce an increase in mean survival time of the mice which is dose related. Further these animals did not lose a significant amount of weight or show other signs of toxicity while undergoing treatment with the drug. The composition of the invention can, for example, be in a form suitable for parenteral e.g. intravenous, intramuscular or intracavitary , oral, topical or rectal administration. Particular forms of the composition may be, for example, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, creams, tablets, capsules, liposomes or micro reservoirs, especially compositions in sterile injectable form. The compound of the present invention can be used in a method of treating cancer in the human or animal body by administering it to a host. Therapeutically effective doses administered either once or repeatedly in man are considered to be in the range of 50 10000 mg metre² body area for each dose preferably at least 500 mg m², for instance up to 5000 mg m² or more, repeated as necessary. The compounds of the present invention show a wide range of antitumour activity against leukaemias, lymphoid malignancies and a spectrum of solid tumours, in particular carcinomas and sarcomas. Thus, in addition to their use as single agents, the compounds of the invention could be co administered with, or contained in a mixed formulation with, for example, mitotic inhibitors e.g. vincristine, vinblastine , alkylating agents e.g. cyclophosphamide, melphalan, myleran, chlorambucil, mustine , anti metabolites e.g. 5 fluorouracil, 6 mercaptopurine, thioguanine, cytosine arabinoside, hydroxyurea , intercalating antibiotics e.g. adriamycin, bleomycin , or enzymes e.g. asparaginase . The compounds of the present invention may also be used as a component of a combined modality treatment, for example including radiotherapy and or surgery. The invention will now be illustrated by the following Examples and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which The 2 desamino analogue CB 3804 of N¹⁰ propargyl 5,8 dideazafolic acid CB 3717 was prepared by a synthesis as outlined in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings.

CB3717 and CB3804 were dissolved in 0.15M NaHCO₃ pH 9 9.5 at either 10, 30 or 50 mg ml. The compounds were administered i.p. to male BDF1 mice at 10 ml kg to give doses of 100, 300 or 500 mg kg. 3 Hours and 6 hours after administration groups of three mice at each dose level were sacrificed by exsanguination via cardiac puncture. Plasma was prepared and the livers and kidneys excised and weighed. Concentrations of CB3717 and CB3804 were determined in the plasma, livers and kidneys by high performance liquid chromatography. As shown in Table 1, CB3717 was readily detected in the plasma, liver and kidneys of all of the mice sacrificed. In contrast, at the time points studied, CB3804 levels were below the limit of detection with the exception of plasma levels 3 hours after administration of CB 3804 at 500 mg kg. Samples of plasma were also analysed for the enzyme alanine transaminase, an indicator of hepatotoxicity. As shown in Table 2, levels of alanine transaminase were markedly elevated following CB3717 treatment, however, following CB3804 administration the levels were within the normal range 5 25U l . To demonstrate that CB3804 is absorbed following i.p. administration an excretion experiment was performed in which mice received 100 mg kg CB3804 i.p. As shown in Table 3, there was elimination of CB3804 in both the faeces and urine. In addition, two components were observed in faeces which may represent CB3804 metabolites. Comparative data for CB3717 are also given in Table 3. These excretion studies indicate that there is satisfactory bioavailability of CB3804 following i.p. administration and hence the lack of hepatotoxicity and the failure to detect CB3804 in the kidneys are properties inherent in the compound. CB3717 and CB3804 were dissolved in 0.15M NaHCO₃ pH9 and administered at 100 mg kg as 1 hour i.v. infusion to pentobarbital anaesthetised female Wistar rats. During and after the infusion blood and bile samples were collected. Four hours after the experiment the rats were sacrificed and the urine collected from the bladder and the liver and kidneys removed. The samples were analysed for CB3717 and CB3804 by HPLC. As shown in Table 4, CB3717 was cleared less rapidly from the plasma of rats than CB3804. This accords with the greater biliary and urinary excretion of CB3804. In contrast to CB3717, no CB3804 could be detected in either the liver or kidneys at the end of the experiment. Samples of plasma were also analysed for alanine transaminase. As shown in Table 4, CB3717 produced pronounced elevation in plasma levels of this enzyme whereas CB3804 did not. Each compound was dissolved in 0.15M NaHCO₃. Thymidylate synthase was assayed by a ³H release method. A 50,000 g supernatant was prepared from a TS over producing 45 fold L1210 cell line that was developed in this Institute. The preparation buffer was 0.05M potassium phosphate 0.01M 2 mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4. The 0.5 ml incubation mixture contained 0.05 ml inhibitor, 0.20 ml supernatant about 10ug supernatant protein , 50 uM ³H dUMP, 0.22 uCi and 200 uM L 5,10 CH₂FH₄ made by dissolving 10u moles L FH₄ in 5 ml of 0.1M dithiothreitol with the addition of formaldehyde to give a final concentration of 20 mM and about 0.1 ml 1N NaOH . The reaction mixture contained a total of 25 umoles of phosphate. Incubation time was for 1 hour at 37 DHFR was partially purified from rat liver and assayed spectrophotometrically. The results are tabulated below Table 5 . The I₅₀ was defined as the inhibitor concentration necessary to reduce the activity of TS by 50 . CB3717 was included as a reference compound so that the results could be expressed as an inverse relative potency IRP I₅₀ test compound I₅₀ CB3717 . The removal of the 2 amino group from the CB3717 structure resulted in a small decrease in potency for TS 8 fold . Much more striking loss of inhibitory activity was noted against DHFR. L1210 and L1210 C15 overproduces TS 45 fold were grown in continuous suspension culture in RPMI 1640 medium 20 mM HEPES supplemented with 10 Horse Serum. Cells in the log phase of growth were diluted to about 5 x 10⁴ ml and duplicate 5ml aliquots were added to 50 ml tissue culture flasks containing the appropriate additions diluted in RPMI and sterilised by Millipore filtration . Cell counts after 48 hours of incubation were obtained by Coulter counting,. The ID₅₀ was defined as that concentration of drug necessary to reduce the count to 50 control at 48 hours. The ID₅₀ concentrations in L1210 and L1210 C15 cell culture are shown in Table 6. CB3717 was performed in parallel. CB3804 was about 7 times more potent than CB3717 against L1210 cells. The L1210 C15 cell line acquired resistance to CB3717 was cross resistant to CB3804. This strongly suggests that TS is the only locus of action involved in CB3804 cytotoxicity. Reversal of the L1210 toxicity of CB3804 could be achieved by co incubation with 10 uM thymidine Table 7 . Although reversal was complete in the presence of 5 uM CB 3804 incomplete reversal 75 of control growth was noted at 50 uM. Again CB3717 50 uM was included as a control. L1210 cells were used at a concentration of 10⁵ ml. Incubation at 37 The L1210 tumour is carried routinely in DBA₂ mice at the Institute of Cancer Research L1210 CBRI . For experiments 5 x 10⁴ cells were implanted i.p. into male C57B1 x DBA₂F₁ hybrid mice 3 days prior to treatment. CB3804 and CB3717 was dissolved in 0.15M NaHCO₃ and adjusted to pH 9.5 before i.p. injection daily x5 . The control group consisted of 9 mice and treated groups 6 or 7 mice. The results are presented in Figure 5 where Controls 25 mg kg CB3804 50 mg kg CB3804 100 mg kg CB3804 CB3804 is a thymidylate synthase inhibitor and all the available evidence strongly suggests that this enzyme is its cytotoxic locus of action. A very significant reduction in inhibitory activity against DHFR was achieved and this may be important in determining good TS inhibition and cytotoxicity. The high level of DHFR in cells relative to TS particularly in some MTX resistant mutants may antagonise TS effects by sequestration of quinazoline based inhibitors thereby reducing the level of free intracellular inhibitor available to bind to TS.
