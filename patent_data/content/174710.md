## Description
Title Audio Signal GeneratorField of the InventionThis invention relates to an auio signal generator.Background to the inventionAudio signal generators commonly comprise an R.C oscillator to produce low distortion sine waves. Examples of such circuits are the Wien bridge type oscillator, the phase shift oscillator and the parallel T oscillator. The frequency of oscillation for such an oscillator is given by the expression f , where R and C are the frequency determining components and K is a constant which is fixed for a given type of oscillator.Frequency variation is enabled in a multiple section oscillator of this type by varying R or C using a two or three ganged control. An example of such a variable frequency audio signal generator is shown in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings.In such a variable frequency audio signal generator, the frequency scale is cramped at one end if a linear control is used. In addition, the frequency at any one point on the scale is dependent on the tolerance and the linearity of the control employed. Suitable control devices to minimise these disadvantages are available, but are inherently very expensive.Object of the inventionIt is an object of this invention to provide a modified audio signal generator employing an R.C. oscillator, which avoids or minimises the above described disadvantages without necessitating the use of expensive control devices.The inventionAccording to the invention, there is provided an audio signal generator of the type normally including at least one variable frequency oscillator providing for frequency variation by variation of the resistence or the capacitance in an R.C circuit, wherein the capacitance of said R.C. circuit is replaced by a capacitance multiplying circuit which, in order to provide for the generation of variable frequency signals, includes an amplified having an input connected to the tapping of a variable resistance connected in parallel with the basic capacitance of the multiplying circuit.ExplanationFigure 2 of the accompanying drawings shows one known form of a capacitance multiplying circuit, normally employed to increase the effective capacitance of a capacitor. The effective input capacitance of this circuit, Cin, is given by the expression Cin C l me, provided that the effects of finite gain i n in the operational amplifiers are ignored.Figure 3 of the accompanying drawings shows a modified multiplying circuit having the property that the effective input capacitance Cin is inversely proportional to the position of the tapping of the variable resistance, ie in practice inversely proportional to the degree of angular rotation of a potentiometer R assuming this to have a v linear law, and independent of its absolute value.As in the circuit of Figure 2, the operational amplified Al is not essential, but improves the Q factor of the effective capacitance.The invention provides for the usual capacitor of the R.C.oscillator in an audio signal generating circuit such as that shown in Figure 1 to be replaced by a modified capacitance multiplying circuit as exemplified by Figure 3.Description of the drawingsIn the accompanying drawings Figure 1 shows the circuit of a known audio signal generator Figure 2 shows a known capacitance multiplying circuit Figure 3 shows a modified capacitance multiplying circuit andFigure 4 shows the circuit of an audio signal generator in accordance with the invention.Description of the embodiment Referring to Figure 4, the circuitry within the dashed lines referenced 10 is essentially that of the known audio signal generator of Figure 1, with the exception of the ganged capacitors C connected in the circuit of Figure 1 to the non inverting inputs of the respective operational amplifiers.The circuitry within the dashed lines referenced 12 comprises two capacitance multiplying circuits, each in accordance with that shown in Figure 3.This circuit of Figure 3 differs from the known capacitance multiplying circuit of Figure 2 in that the resistors Rl, R2 of Figure 2 are replaced by a potentiometer Rv, and the inverting input of the operational amplifier A2 is connected to the potentiometer tapping slide . The circuit of Figure 3 has the property that the effective capacitance C. is inversely in proportional to the angular position of the slider of the potentiometer R and is independent of the absolute value v of the latter.Thus, reverting to Figure 4, the circuitry 12 provides anR.C. oscillator audio signal generator having a linear scale on which the frequency is independent of the absolute value of the control device operating the ganged potentiometers Rv. v In the circuit of Figure 4, the resistors R may be of the 5 presettable type, included to limit the range of frequency variation imparted by R to, for example, one decade, v and or to limit the voltage excursion in the operational amplifiers A2. Either the capacitors C or the resistors R or a combination of both may be switchable to provide multiple frequency ranges.Possible modifications include omission of the second operational amplifiers Al and the inclusion of a resistor between the potentiometer R and the output of the first v operational amplifier A2. These modifications make it possible to avoid the use of special values for the timing resistors or capacitors.
