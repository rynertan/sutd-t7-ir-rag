# METHOD OF CONTROLLING PROFILING.

## Abstract
A method of controlling profiling comprises the steps of storing in a memory 102 a plurality of path patterns MCR₁ to MCR₃ each constituted by, as variables, data for specifying at least the region to be profiled storing in another memory 101 profiling data including call commands MCC₁ to MCC₃ for calling out predetermined path patterns and real numbers reading out the profiling data block by block to control profil ing reading out, when a path pattern call command is read out, a predetermined path pattern from the memory 102 as well as substituting the real number for the variable to obtain the region to be profiled and effecting profiling of the obtained region in accordance with the read out path pattern.
