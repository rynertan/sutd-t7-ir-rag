# Actuator assembly for memory apparatus.

## Abstract
A transducer actuator assembly 10 for a rotating disc memory apparatus has at least one pair of coils 40, 41 symmetrically spaced from a center plane of a linearly moving carriage 21 where the coils are stationary with respect to a fixed actuator base 11 and surrounding spaced center poles 34 of a magnetic pole piece flux return structure 31, 32, 33 having an E Shaped configuration closed by pole plate 38 . At least one pair of magnets 24a d or 60, 61 are affixed to and extend horizontally from the sides 23 of the carriage and are spaced in longitudinally extending air gaps 45 48, 49 between the fixed coils and linearly extending pole piece portions 32, 33 .
