# SEMICONDUCTOR SWITCHING DEVICE

## Abstract
An integrated circuit semiconductor switching device that can be selectively operated as an SCR 89, 91 or high volt age transistor 91 in one embodiment, includes the circuit equivalent of a PNPN silicon controlled rectifier SCR 89, 91, an equivalent N channel field effect transistor 93 having its channel connected between the base and emitter electrodes of the equivalent PNP transistor 89 of the SCR 89, 91, whereby in one mode of operation, the switching device is operable for turning on in the manner of an SCR at a time when the field ef fect transistor 93 is turned off, thereafter the field effect tran sistor 93 is turned on for substantially reducing the relative im pedance of its channel, thereby shunting current away from the equivalent PNP transistor 89, reducing the forward current gain of the latter to about zero, for permitting the equivalent SCR 89, 91 to be turned off in the manner of an NPN transistor, via the application of a zero volt or negative signal to the base electrode of its equivalent NPN transistor 91.
