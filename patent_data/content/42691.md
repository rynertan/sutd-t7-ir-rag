## Description
DIGITAL INDICATION TYPE SPEEDOMETER The present invention relates to digital indication type speedometers, and particularly to improvements in a digital indication type speedometer comprising a gate circuit for being opened for a given gate time at each predetermined time a speed counter for counting speed pulses emitted in proportion to a vehicle speed for a given gate time, during which the gate circuit is opened an indication register for latching an output from the speed counter until the succeeding counting is completed and an indicator for digitally indicating a value latched in the indication register. In general, a digital indication type speedometer for digitally indicating a running speed of a vehicle or the like comprises a gate circuit for being opened for a given gate time at each predetermined time a speed counter for counting speed pulses emitted in proportion to a vehicle speed through the rotation of a propeller shaft, wheel or the like for a given gate time, during which the gate circuit is opened an indication register for latching an output from the speed counter until the succeeding counting is completed and an indicator for digitally indicating the value latched by the indication register. This digital indication type speedometer has such a characteristic feature that the vehicle speed is constantly digitally indicated by the indicator.However, with this type of speedometer, heretofore, the gate time of the gate circuit has been made on irrespective of the presence of the speed pulses, particularly, in a running condition of the vehicle at a constant speed, the timing of opening of the gate circuit and the timing of the speed pulse have been shifted from each other, whereby dispersions are resulted in the values counted by the speed counter, thereby presenting such a disadvantage that the speed indication in the indicator flickers. To obviate the abovedescribed disadvantage, there has been proposed to provide a hysteresis processing circuit, in which comparison is made between the output from the speed counter and the value latched by the indication register, and, only when a difference therebetween is out of the range of allowance, the value latched in the indication register is rewritten to a value commensurate to the output from the speed counter. However, only the provision of this hysteresis circuit could not completely obviate the abovedescribed disadvantage. There may be proposed that, with or without this hysteresis circuit, the gate time of the gate circuit is made on in synchronism with the speed pulse. However, if a first pulse of the speed pulses is used for the synchronism with the gate circuit, one pulse is decreased from the number of pulses counted by the speed counter, whereby there may occur a possibility of causing a steady offset. More specifically, in a digital indication type speedometer wherein the first pulse of the speed pulses is used for the synchronism with the gate circuit, if one pulse of the speed pulses is made to correspond to 0.5 km h or 0.5 mile h of the actual speed of the vehicle and a hysteresis of 1 km h or 1 mile h is given in rewriting the indication register, then the relationship between the actual speed of the vehicle and the indicated speed is indicated by solid lines A when the lowest bit of the indication register is 1 or indicated by broken lines B when the lowest bit of the indication register is 0 in Fig. 1. In either case, the indicated speed is lower than the actual speed of the vehicle. In order to obviate the disadvantages as described above, it is necessary to add a value of speed corresponding to one pulse to the value counted by the speed counter, which, however, would entail a problem of complicating the circuit arrangement. The present invention has been developed to obviate the abovedescribed disadvantages and has as its object the provision of a digital indication type speedometer in which, while no steady offset is generated and the circuit arrangement is not complicated, the flickering of the indication during running of the vehicle at a constant speed is decreased. According to the present invention, in a digital indication type speedometer comprising a gate circuit for being opened for a given gate time at each predetermined time, a speed counter for counting speed pulses emitted in proportion to a vehicle speed for a given gate time, during which the gate circuit is opened, an indication register for latching an output from the speed counter until the succeeding counting is completed, and an indicator for digitally indicating the value latched in the indication register, the gate circuit is opened in synchronism with the rise of the speed pulse and the speed counter is adapted to count the number of rises of the speed pulses, thereby enabling to achieve the object The abovementioned features and object of the present invention will become more apparent by reference to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals denote like elements, and in which Fig. 1 is a chart showing an example of the relationship between the actual speed of the vehicle and the indicated speed in the conventional digital indication type speedometer Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing the general arrangement of an embodi ment of the digital indication type speedometer according to the present invention Fig. 3 is a block diagram showing an example of the arrangement of the hysteresis processing circuit in the abovementioned embodiment Fig. 4 is a chart showing performance waveshapes in the respective portions of the abovementioned embodiment and Fig. 5 is a chart showing the relationship between the actual speed of the vehicle and the indicated speed in the abovementioned embodiment.

As shown in Fig. 3 for example, the hysteresis processing circuit 18 comprises a digital subtraction circuit 30 for calculating a difference between the output signal 102 from the speed counter 12 and the value latched in the indication register 14 a first digital reference circuit 32 for digitally setting a reference value on the plus side of hysteresis, e.g., 1 km h or 1 mile h a second reference circuit 34 for digitally setting a reference value on the minus side of hysteresis, e.g., 1 km h or 1 mile ri a first comparison circuit 36 for emitting an output signal 202 in response to an output 200 obtained through subtraction in the digital subtraction circuit 30 uien the output from the speed counter 12 becomes larger than the value latched in the indication register 14 exceeding the reference value on the plus side of the first reference circuit 32 a second comparison circuit 38 for emitting an output signal 203 in response to an output 200 obtained through subtraction in the digital subtraction circuit 30 when the output from the speed counter 12 becomes smaller than the value latched in the indication register 14 exceeding the reference value on the minus side of hysteresis of the second reference circuit 34 a first AND gate 40 for being opened to pass the output signal 202 from the first comparison circuit 36 when 1 is indicated by a plus minus signal 201, which, depending upon plus or minus of the result of subtraction in the digital subtraction circuit 30, indicates I when the result is plus or 0 when the result is minus a second AND gate 44 for being opened to pass the output signal 203 from the second comparison circuit 38 when the result of subtraction is minus, when 0 is indicated by the plus minus signal 201 inverted in the inverter 203 and an OR gate for emitting a logical sum between the first AND gate 40 and the second AND gate 44 as a difference presence signal 104. Consequently, this hysteresis processing circuit 18 is adapted to obtain a difference between the output signal 102 from the speed counter 12 and the value 103 latched in the indication register 14 and indicate the difference presence signal 104 as 1 when the difference is out of the range of allowance. More specifically, the value 103 latched in the indication register 14 is subtracted from the output signal 102 of the speed counter 12 in the digital subtraction circuit 30, the result of subtraction is compared with the reference value on the plus side of hysteresis being set in the first digital reference circuit 32, e.g., 1 km h or 1 mile h, and, when the result of subtraction is larger than the reference value, the output signal 202 from the comparison circuit 36 is indicated as 1 .In the second comparison circuit 38, the result of subtraction from the digital subtraction circuit 30 is compared with the reference value on the minus side of hysteresis being set in the second digital reference circuit 34, e.g., 1 km h or 1 mile h, and, when the result of subtraction is smaller than the reference value, the output signal 203 is indicated as 1 .The first and second AND gates 40 and 44 are provided for selecting either one of the comparison circuit to be used depending upon plus or minus of the output from the digital subtraction circuit 30, when the result of subtraction from the digital subtraction circuit 30 is of plus and the plus minus signal is indicated as 1 , the first AND gate 40 is opened, and, when the result of subtraction from the digital subtraction circuit 30 is of minus and the plus minus signal 201 is indicated as 0 , the second AND gate 44 is opened. The OR gate 46 is adapted to indicate the difference presence signal 104 as 1 when an output is emitted from either the first AND gate 40 or the second AND gate 44. As shown in Fig. 2, the zero indication discriminating circuit 20 com parses. an OR gate 50 for emitting a logical sum between the speed pulse 100 and the initial reference signal 108 from the timing pulse generating circuit 22 a time counter 52 for counting the emitting intervals of the speed pulses 100 in response to a clock pulse signal 109 from the timing pulse generating circuit 22 until it is reset by an output from the OR gate 50 and a bistable multivibrator 54 adapted to be reset for feeding the zero indication signal 105 to the OR gates 28 and 26 when a time counter value 110 from the time counter 52 exceeds a predetermined value. Consequently, in this zero indication discriminating circuit 20, when the emitting interval of the speed pulse 100 exceeds the time being set by the time counter 52 and the bistable multivibrator 54, e.g., 0.28 sec., the zero indication signal 105 from the bistable multivibrator 54 is indicated as 1 and the indication register 14 and the speed counter 12 are reset through the OR gates 28 and 26 to forcibly set their values to 0. As shown in Fig. 2, the timing pulse generating circuit 22 comprises a bistable multivibrator 60 for receiving the speed pulses 100 an AND gate 66, to which an output of a Q terminal of the bistable multivibrator 60 is directly fed and an output of a Q terminal of the bistable multivibrator 60 is fed through a resistor 62 and a capacitor 64 a resistor 68, a capacitor 70, a diode 72 and an inverter 74 for emitting the first reference signal 108 when the power is turned on an oscillator 76 for emitting the clock pulse signal 109 a shift register 80 in which an output from the oscillator 76 is directly fed to a CP terminal thereof and same is fed to a D terminal thereof through a frequency dividing circuit 78 an AND gate 84 for receiving an output from the shift register 80 directly and through an inverter 82 and emitting a latch signal 106 an AND gate 88 for receiving an output from the shift register 80 directly and through an inverter 86 and emitting a reset signal 107 at a timing slightly behind the latch signal 106 a three inputOR gate 90 for receiving the reset signal 107 from the AND gate 88, an output from the AND gate 66 and the initial reference signal 108 from the inverter 74 and feeding a reset signal to the frequency dividing circuit 78 and an OR gate 92 for receiving the initial reference signal 108 from the inverter 74 and an output from the frequency dividing circuit 78, and feeding a reset signal to the bistable multivibrator 60. Description will hereunder be given of action with reference to Fig.4. The speed pulses 100 generated in proportion to the speed of the vehicle through the rotation of the wheel as shown in Fig. 4 a are fed to the speed counter 12 through the AND gate 10 and the inverter 27, only for a given time T, during which the gate signal 101 from the timing pulse generating circuit 22 as shown in Fig.4 b is indicated as 1 and the AND gate 10 is opened. At this time, the gate signal 101 is indicated as 1 in synchronism with the rise of the speed pulse 100 and changed to 0 after holding 1 for the given time T, whereby the AND gate 10 is opened in synchronism with the rise of the speed pulse 100, so that dispersions in the counted values due to the shift of the timing of the gate signal from the timing of the speed pulse can be avoided. Provided at the input side of the speed counter 12 is an inverter 27, which inverts the speed pulses 100 into signals shown in Fig. 4 Cc , rises of the signals thus inverted, i.e., falls of the speed pulses 100 are counted by the speed counter 12, so that the decrease in the value counted by the speed counter 12 due to synchronizing the speed pulse 100 with the gate signal 101 can be avoided. After the gate signal 101 is changed to 0 , the timing pulse generating circuit 22 feeds a latch signal 106 shown in Fig. 4 d to the AND gate 24.Concurrently, in the hysteresis processing circuit 18, a difference between the output signal 102 from the speed counter 12 and the value 103 latched in the indication register 14 is obtained, and, when this difference exceeds the reference value set by the digital reference circuit 32 or 34 in either plus or minus direction, the difference presence signal 104 is indicated as 1 . This difference presence signal 104 is changed into a gate signal for the aforesaid latch signal 106 in theAND gate 24.Consequently, if 1 is fed from the timing pulse generating circuit 22 to the latch signal 106 when the difference presence signal 104 is 1 , the output from the AND gate 24 is changed to 1 , whereby the value latched in the indication register 14 is rewritten to a value commensurate to the output signal 102 counted value from the speed counter 12.On the other hand, when the difference between the output signal 102 from the speed counter 12 and the value 103 latched in the indication register 14 does not reach the reference value, the difference presence signal 104 remains indicated as 0 , and, even if 1 is fed to the latch signal 106, the value latched in the indication register 14 is not renewed Consequently, when the difference between the output counted value from the speed counter 12 and the value latched in the indication register 14 does not reach the predetermined value set in the hysteresis processing circuit 18, e.g., i 1 km h or i 1 mile h, the value latched in the indication register 14 is not uselessly changed, whereby the value indicated by the indicator 16 is held at a given value, so that the indication of the indicator 16 will not flicker during running of the vehicle at a constant speed. On the other hand, in the condition where the output from the speed counter 12 is considerable fluctuated during acceleration or deceleration, the value latched in the indication register 14 is rewritten from time to time, so that no problem occurs during acceleration or deceleration. Meanwhile, the speed pulses 100 and the initial reference numeral 108 as the reset signal are fed to the time counter 52 of the zero indication discriminating circuit 20 through the OR gate 50, and the time counter 52, as shown inFig. 4 f , is adapted to count the clock pulse signals 109 from the oscillator 76 of the timing pulse generating circuit 22 for each emitting interval of the speed pulses 100 as a time count 110.When the vehicle is brought into a very slow running condition or stopped condition and the time count 110 counted by the time counter 52 exceeds a predetermined interval preset in the bistable multivibrator 54, e.g., 0.28 sec . the zero indication signal 105 from the bistable multivibrator 54, as shown in Fig. 4 g , is indicated as 1 , which is fed as the reset signal to the indication register 14 and the speed counter 12 through the OR gates 28 and 26, whereby the values latched in the indication register 14 and the speed counter 12 are forcibly turned to be zero.The reason why an output from the zero indication discriminating circuit 20 is fed to not only the indication register 14 but also the speed counter 12 here is to prevent the flickering of the indication caused by the difference between the values of the speed counter 12 and the indication register 14 during a very slow running condition. With the arrangement as described above, when the vehicle is brought into a stopped condition from a running condition, the value latched in the indication register 14 can be made zero and the value indicated by the indicator 16 can be made 0 km h or 0 mile h immediately.As against the above, heretofore, there have been observed such indications that, under the worst condition, i.e., when a speed pulse 100 corresponding to more than 1 km h or 1 mile h is fed immediately after the gate signal 101 has been indicated as 1 and, if the vehicle is instantly brought into a stopped condition, then the gate signal 101 indicated as 1 is turned into 0 to indicate a speed more than 1 km h or 1 mile h, and further, when 1 is fed to the latch signal 106 after the gate signal is turned from 1 to 0 , then 0 km h or 0 mile h is indicated. With the arrangement as described above, the indicated value cannot become zero immediately after the vehicle is stopped, thereby presenting a feeling of incompatibility.Furthermore, by use of this zero indication discriminating circuit 20, such a disadvantage can be obviated that, when the vehicle is brought into the stopped condition from the running condition is spite of that the actual speed of the vehicle is zero, the value latched in the indication register 14 is not changed to zero because the actual speed is below the hysteresis processing circuit 18, and an indication other than zero remains steadily in the indicator 16 On the other hand, 1 is fed from the AND gate 84 of the timing pulse generating circuit 22 to the latch signal 106, thereafter, 1 is fed from the AND gate 88 to the reset signal 107 as shown in Fig. 4 e , and the value of the speed counter 12 is reset to zero through the OR gate 26 so as to be ready for the speed pulse counting during the succeeding gate time.Consequently, when 1 is fed to the speed pulse 100 after 1 is fed to the reset signal 107, the gate signal 101 is synchronized with the rise of the speed pulse 100 by the timing pulse generating circuit 22 and indicated as 1 again. In addition, since there is a possibility that the abovedescribed operation is not satisfactorily effected when the power source is turned on, initial resettings are effected by the initial reset signal 108 on the speed counter 12, the indication register 14, the time counter 52 and the bistable multivibrator 54 of the zero indi cation discriminating circuit 20, the bistable multivibrator 60 and the shift register 80 of the time pulse generating circuit 22 and the like thereby preventing the mulfunc tion. Fig. 5 shows the relationship between the actual speed of the vehicle and the indicated speed. In the drawing, the solid lines A show the relationship when the lowest bit of the indication register is 1 and the broken lines B show the relationship when the lowest bit of the indication register is 0 . Further, a hatched region is the region of the indication 0 by the zero indication discrimi nating circuit. In both cases as described above, it is apparent that the indicated speed approaches the actual speed of the vehicle, whereby the steady error is decreased. In the abovedescribed embodiment, the hysteresis processing circuit and the zero indication discriminating circuit are combinedly used, whereby the flickering of the indication during running of the vehicle at a constant speed can be more reliably prevented, and the indication is made zero instantly when the vehicle is stopped, thereby enabling to minimize the feeling of incompatibility. Needless to say, either one of the hysteresis processing circuit or the zero indication discriminating circuit may be omitted. As has been described hereinabove, the present invention can offer such advantages that, while no steady offset is generated and the circuit arrange ment is not complicated, the flickering of the indication during running of the vehicle at a constant speed is decreased and the error between the actual speed of the vehicle and the indicated speed is reduced. From the foregoing description, it should be apparent to one skilled in the art the abovedescribed embodiment is but one of many possible specific embodiments which can represent the applications of the principles of the present invention. Numerous and varied other arrangements can be readily devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
