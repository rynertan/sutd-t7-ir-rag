# CT scanner.

## Abstract
An X ray CT scanner comprises a cable handling device 20 provided with a ring shaped housing 24 for receiving a cable member 90 . This housing is divided into an inner pe ripheral member 26 and outer peripheral member 28 re spectively having a U shaped cross section. The inner peri pheral member is made rotatable, while the outer peripheral member is fixed in place. A plurality of rollers 32 is provided in the ring shaped housing 24 with the shafts 33 of said rollers 32 interposed between said inner and outer peripheral mem bers 26, 28 . The rollers are arranged at a prescribed interval with the shafts 33 thereof inserted into the holes 36 formed in a ring shaped coupling member 34 . The cable member 90 is wound around the inner peripheral member 26 at least once, and then wound about half the periphery of a specified roller 38 , and finally wound around the outside of the group of the rollers 32 in a direction opposite to that in which said cable member 90 is wound within the housing 24 . The end portions 98, 100 of the cable member facing the inner and ou ter peripheral members 26, 28 of the housing are fixed thereto. Mounted on the rotating frame are an X ray tube 50 , X ray detector 54 and high voltage generator 46 . The high voltage generator and X ray tube are connected together by a short high voltage cable 48 . The inner peripheral member 26 of the ring shaped housing is rotated with the rotating frame 40 . The cable member 90 is wound around said inner peripheral member or unwound therefrom. The rollers 32 are provided between the cable member 90 wound around the inner peripheral member 26 of the ring shaped housing and the cable member 90 wound around the outside of the group of rollers. The rollers are driven with the rotation of the inner peripheral member of said housing, thereby preventing the cable member from being displaced from the regular rotation course.
