# Composition for reducing turbidity in samples of biological fluids.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a composition which reduces the turbidity of samples of artificial or naturally occurring biological fluids comprising a buffering agent a nonionic surfactant alpha cyclodextrin a lipase and water. The composition provides a catalyst for hydrolysing and agents which hydrolyze triglycerides present in the sample to glycerol and free fatty acids. Also present in the composition is a complexing agent or agents to render the catalyzed fatty acids water soluble.
