## Description
An adjustment device for the valve controlling the water flushing front, a flushing tank for water closet Tbe present invention reates to an adjustment device for the valve unit of the so called Sifonic type, designed to control the water flushing from a flushing tank into a flushing pipe connected to a water closet boil or like sanitary appliances so as to permit said valve unit to be mounted in flushing tanks of different sizes and designs.Up to the date the manufacturers have always constructed flushing tanks provided Wtfl. flushing valve units which could be replaced only by other similar units, each adapted only for a predetermined type of flushing tank.As a result thereof for replacement purposes the plumbers must have at their disposal different types of flushing valve units adapted for the various types of the different flushing tanks on the market.The present invention aims to overcome said inconveniences providing an adjustment device to enable a flushing valve unit of the Sifonic type to be mounted in which ever flushing tank. or or such a purpose tis invention provides to connect, in an adjustable manner, the rod carrying the valve body previded to close the inlet orifice of the flushing pipe which is connected to the water closet bowl or like sanitary appliance, to a control tubular bar so as to obtain a valve control member of an adjustable length, this connection being effective only in the raising direction of the valve rod, so that, on the contrary, this latter can freely slide along said tubular bar, as this bar is returned in its sower end position.The tub lar ar at its upper end is guided by a sleeve made tegral . a cross oar or yoke r.e nber which is frictionally slidably mounted on and supported by two vertical posts, but which can be locked to these posts y looking means, in releasable manner, at the desired height therecf, one of the two posts being constituted of a tube so as to be able to be use as overflow pipe which is put in communication with the flushing pipe downstream of the seat of the flushing valve, which is of the well known type, made of an elastomeric material or rubber so as to be elastically deformable and which has a substantially spherical shape. The reans for locking yoke to its supporting posts are such that the locking operation does not require the use cf any tool. The adjustment device of this invention is very simple tre construction as ell as in the use and it is such as to last long, even if during the use of this device it will l remain at least partially always soaked inside the water with which the flushing tank is filled. The device of this invention can be mounted in various types of flushing tanks by means of simple adjustment operations which can be performed by any skilled worker also not very skilled in the art.These and other characteristics and advantages of this invention will be better understood from the following description of this invention with reference to the accompanying drawing in which Figure i is G diagrammatic partially sectioned front vie of the device mounted inside a flushing tank Figure 2 shows a detail of the cross section thereof, taken on the line A A of Figure 1 Figure 3 shows the sar detail before the assembly of the locking slotted plate and Figure 4 is the detail of the locking slotted plate shown in front view.Now referring to the drawling, 1 generally indicates the botton of a flushing tank only partially shown and provided witch a removable cover 2. The device of this invention comprises a base body 3 extending downwards with a vertical tubular body 4 which will be connected by conventional locking means with the flushing pipe not sholm . The tubular body 4 passes through a hole arranged in the bottom 1 and is externally threaded at 4a so as to receive the locking nut 5 provided to connect the conduit 4 to the bottom 1 with the interposition of conventional pacing rings.The base body 3 extends upwards with two vertical cylindrical posts 6 and 7, the post 6 consisting of a tubular member which has such a height as to act also as overflow ipe. For such a purpose at its lower end the inner cavity 8 of the tubular post 6 is put in communication by a pipe union 8a with the inner conduit 11 of the tubular body 4 downstream of the inlet orifice 11a thereof which constitutes the seat of the valve 12.The valve 12 is a valve of a well known type and is constituted of a substantially spherical body made of an elastomeric material or of rubber so as to be elastically deformable and which is partially hollow at least in its lower part and is open at its lower end so that under the suction effect produced by the water falling down inte the flushing pipe an aspiration is causes nto the open inner cavity of the valve 12 which causes the valve body 12 to be squashed against the valve seat, i.e. the inlet orifice 11a of the conduit 11.At 14 is indicated a yoke member which can be moved up and down and which is guided in this direction by means of two outer open collars 15 and 16, which can frictionally slide respectively along the cylindrical pests 6 and 7. Each c the collars 15 and 1E consIsts of a C annular ember having end lemb portions 17 extending outwards and each provided with an outer side tooth 17a Figures 2 nd 3 . The parallel end limbs 17 are spaced apart from one another of a certain distance in their unstressed conditions the width of which can be reduced by forcing the limbs 17 one against the other and that is performed the use of a slotted plate 18 having a thlclrness nct higher tn the distance between each tooth 17a and the adjacent collar body 15 or 16.In each plate 18 a shape slot is provided extending longitudinally and lJhich comprises a first section 19a having a width greater than the distance between the outer side surfaces of the teeth 17a cf the limbs 17 or each collar 15 or 16, and a second section 19b having slightly convergent side walls an which has G width which becomes shorter than the distance between the outer side surfaces of the end limb 17 in their unstressed conditions, but slightly greater than the sum of their thicknesses.Therefore, by introducing the limbs 17, 17a through the wider portions 19a of the slots 19a, 19b of each slotted plate 18 for locking the yoke 14 the desired heigth it will be sufficient to push each plate 18 downwardly up to cause the limbs 17 to enter the respective narrower section 19 Figure 4 so as to cause the limbs 17 to be forced one against the other so as to lock the collar 15 or 16 to the post 6 or 7 respectively in a releasable manner.The bGl e body 14 extends upwardly with two parallel arms 20 fixedly connected at their upper ends to a vertical innerly threaded sleeve 21 to which a vertical tubular member 22 is screwed. At the upper end of the tubular member 22 is mounted a removable cap 23 provided with an axial hole. Between the cap 23 and the upper end of the tubular member 22 will be inserted the tank cover 2 which for such a purpose is provided w ith a vertical hole 24 for the passage of the tubular member 22 and of the stem of the cap 23.In the inside of the tubular member 22 and of the cap 23 passes a tubular bar 25, on the upper end of which a gripping knob 26 is screwed, while at its lower end the bar 25 has an outer threaded portion 25a by means of which it is screwed to a cap 28 provided with an ayial threaded hole or the free passage of thC valve rod 13 which has such G lenght that its upper end portion remains always in the inside of the tubular bar 25 whatever nay be the position of the valve 12 or the depth of the flushing tank.For the adjusting of the flushing valve unit by means of the adjustment device of the invention the slotted plates 16 are renoved from the limbs 17 and the yoke l is moved up or down up to attain the height necessary for the correct valve operation according to the s size of the flushing tank, in which the valve unit has to be mounted.Then the position of the rod 13 with respect to the bar 25 is adjusted in such G manner that the valve 12 can open in response of the raising of the knob 26 Up to a predetermined height. For such a purpose about the rod 13 is mounted an elastic adjustable collar stop means 27 which will be positioned at such a height as to be placed always just above the cap 2 , so that as the knob 26 Is raised together with the tubular bar 2,, the cap 28 through the stop means 27 causes the rod 13 together with the valve 12 to move upwards so that the valve 12 can open the inlet orifice lia and water fall down into the flushing pipe afterwards the valve 12 becomes free of floating on the water surface up to the instant in which the flushing tank becomes empty, so that, under the suction effect of the discharge of the water through the flushing pipe, the valve 12 is sucked against its seat lla on account of the under pressure created in the inside of the lower cavity of the valve 12 which is of a partially hollow type and has elastically deformable walls. The operation of said closure valve 12 will be not furtherly described, since it is well known and it does not concern the present invention. It has only to be pointed cut that each upward movement of the rod 13 is entirely free, since the connection between the tubular bar 25 and the rod 13 becomes effective only as a result of the raising of the bar 25 with regard to the rod 13, said connection taking place as the cap 29 abuts against the collar stop means 27 or the like fixed to the rod 13 in an adjustable position.
