## Description
TETRAHYDRONICOTINAMIDE DERIVATIVES,A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME AND A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION COMPRISING THE SAME This invention relates to 1,4,5,6 tetrahydronicotinamide derivatives of the formula EMI1.1 wherein R is a phenyl or pyridyl group which may have one or more substituents , a process for producing the same and a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same. In the formula I , the substituent of the phenyl and pyridyl is, for example, an alkyl group containing 1 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group containing 1 4 carbon atoms or a halogen atom, i.e. a fluorine, chlorine, brine or io3ine atom. The compoundsof this inventionare produced by partially reducing, for example, a nicotinamide derivative of the formula EMI1.2 wherein R has the same meaning as defined above . The reduction is performed by hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst and a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, alcohol, hydrous alcohol or acetic acid, preferably alcoholic solvents. Commonly employed metal catalysts are used, and palladium on carbon is particularly preferred.A Raney nickel catalyst may also be used. The reaction temperature is in the range of from 0 to 1000C, preferably from 10 to 500C, and the reaction is completed by having the nicotinamide derivative absorb about 2 mols of hydrogen at a hydrogen pressure of 1 to 50 atm , preferably 2 to 5 atm. The compounds of this invention are useful pharmaceutic als since they have not only a high ability to suppress aggregation of platelets but also antiinflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic activity. Experiments with animals have shown that many antiinflammatory agents have ability to suppress aggregation of platelets. But it has been pointed out that one defect of these antiinflammatory agents is that when administered to living organisms, they suppress the prostaglandin I2 activity in the walls of the arteries and with extended administration, they accelerate the aggregation of platelets on the arterial walls. The compoundsof this invention are free from these defects and are used to prevent and cure thrombosis and arealso effective as antiinflammatory and antipyretic analgesic agents. When used as a medicine, the compounds of this invention are formulated by a conventional technique into tablets,granules, powders, capsules or injection preparations, and administered to patients either orally or parenterally. A tablet, granule, powder or capsule is prepared by mixing the compound with a pharmaceutical carrier such as lactose, starch, dextrin, sucrose, crystalline cellulose, kaolin, calcium carbonate, preparation talc or magnesium stearate. An injectionris prepared by dissolving the compound in distilled water or a solution of salt such as sodium chloride or potassium chloride The dosage of the compounds of this invention is 5 300 mg Kg day, preferably 10 150 mg Kg day, for oral administration, and is 0.5 100 mg Kg day, preferably 1 50 mg Kg day, for parenteral administration.The desired amount is administered in a single dose or in several doses daily. This invention is now described in greater detail by reference to the following experiment and examples to which this invention is by no means limited. Experiment Effect of preventing acute pulmonary thromboembolic death of mice Six week old male ddY SPF strain mice were administered orally with 200 mg Kg of the compounds of Examples 9 and 10 and the active controls. Four hours later, the mice were intravenously administered with 325 mg Kg of ADP and 140 mg Kg of sodium arachidonate. The number of the mice that were dead within 24 hours of the administration of ADP and sodium arachidonate was counted and the results are shown in the table below. As a reference compound, ticlopidine and sulfinpirazone were used and their efficacy to prevent acute thrombosis was compared with that of the compounds of this invention.
