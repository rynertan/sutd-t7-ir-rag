# LOAD INDICATING DEVICE

## Abstract
A load indicating device, e.g. an overload detector adapted to be placed between a load and a hoisting cable of a crane, consists of an annular member I of a high tensile steel, which is stressed by the load along a given axis within its elastic limit and is provided with an electric displacement transducer III placed between the portions of the annular member I with its displacement axis at right angles to the load vector F, F . The member I is elongated in proportion to the load acting on it, whereby the distance between the portions associated with the transducer III decreases, thus changing the output from the transducer III which obtains an input from a voltage source. This output is fed into an electric circuit IV adapted to indicate the actual weight of the load and or to produce a warning signal and or to stop the machinery at a dangerous overload.
