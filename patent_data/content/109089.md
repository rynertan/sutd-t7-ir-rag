# Process for purifying modulators of the immune system.

## Abstract
This invention relates to modulators of the human im mune system. A modulator as herein defined is any substance that effects direct or indirect response of an animal or human body, portion thereof or matter taken therefrom, to antigens to which said body has been previously exposed. where such re sponse is specifically attributable to the function of the immu nity system of said animal or human. Substances having gen eral effects which may include effects on the immune response are therefore not subsumed within the term modulator , as herein defined. These modulators described herein manifest their activity in a delayed hypersensitivity skin reaction test, and therefore appear to exert their primary effect on the cell mediated immunity system. It will be understood, however, that the described modulators have broad effects on the entire immunity system, and may affect the humoral immunity sys tem. In the present invention, modulators of the human im mune system have been isolated from dialysates of leukocyte extracts. Six such modulators have amplifier activity and two have suppressor activity. Amplifiers are considered useful in the treatment of anergic conditions and conditions of immune hyposensitivity, both local and systemic, while suppressors are considered useful for the preparation and treatment of lo cal hypersensitivity conditions, such as poison ivy. These am plifiers are designated amplifiers 1 6. The suppressors are identified as the S suppressor and the L suppressor. The in vention relates also to compositions containing the modula tors and to processes for purifying modulator material.

## Description
MODULATORS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM, COMPOJITIONo wONTAs THE SAME AND PROCESS FOR PURIFYING MODULATOR MATERIAL BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The human immune system is highly complex and at present imperfectly understood. It is presently considered to have two principal aspects 1 humoral immunity1 which is mediated by circulating antibodies and 2 cell mediated immunity, which, as the name implies, is mediated by cells, viz., lymphoid cells. Humoral immunity is transferred from an immune donor to a non immune recipient by means of serum immunoglobulins. Such serum mediated transfers result in immune responses that are manifest almost instantly. Cell mediated immunity is transferred by means of peripheral blood leukocytes, and such immune responses develop slowly, over a period of several hours.The present invention concerns cell mediated immunity. A typical manifestation of cell mediated immunity is the delayed hypersensitivity DH skin reaction. A DH skin reaction is observed when the appropriate antigen is injected subcutaneously. Within 24 to 48 hours, local inflammation erythema and a swelling and thickening induration are observed in a sensitive individual. The degree of sensitivity may be measured by the size and severity of the reaction. TheDH reaction also presents characteristic histological findings, specifically, perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes and monocytes in the inflamed area. The cells seen at the site of a DH reaction are derived from the peripheral blood leukocyte population. The mechanisms of cell mediated immunity are as yet incompletely understood. It is known that the cells which mediate the response are capable of responding in a variety of ways to an antlgenlc challenge. These rcsponscs include proliferation of cells bearing specific sciisittvity to a given antigen the induction and multiplication of cells mediating a variety of immune functions, including antibody production and reactions against foreign cells and tumors.The quality and quantity of these response patterns is affected by many factors, including 1 hormones of the thymus and adrenal cortex 2 interferons and 3 other effectors of cellular responses, including histamine, serotonin, and the prostaglandins. The present invention relates to the discovery of modulators of the immunity system, isolated from dialyzed extracts of leukocytes profoundly affecting the quality and quantity of cell mediated immunity responses useful in the treatment of a variety of clinical conditions characterized by overreaction or by inadequate reaction to a specific antigen and useful in the alleviation of certain anergic conditions.Prior Art In 1954, H.S. Lawrence reported that a lysate prepared from the leukocytes of tuberculin sensitive donors could transfer that sensitivity to tuberculin nonreactive recipients.Journal of Clinical Investigation, 33 951 1954 . For a later review of that work, see Lawrence, H.S., The Harvey Lectures, 68 239 19711 . For collections of state of the art papers, seeTransfer Factor Basic Properties and Clinical Applications,M.S. Ascher, A.A. Gottlieb the applicant3, and C.H. Kirkpatrick, Eds., Academic Press, Inc., New York 1976 , and Immune Regulators in Transfer Factor, A. Kahn et al., Eds., Academic Press, Inc., New York 1979 . The transfer of sensitivity on which Lawrence reported was presumed to be due to a factor in the leukocyte lysate that was later given the operational term transfer factor. See Lawrence, H.S., commenting on paper of Najarian, J.S., and Feldman, J.D., inCell Bound Antibodies B. Amos and H. Koprowski, Eds. . The transfer factor phenomenon is demonstrable only in human beings. Consequently, research progress in isolating and characterizing the active principle has been slow. To demonstrate transfer factor, two patients must be identirled, 1 a donor, known to display a DH reaction to a given antigen, and 2 a recipicnt, known to give no DH reaction when challenged with the same antigen and therefore presumably lacking cell mediated immunity to that antigen . Leukocytes prepared from the blood of the donor are disrupted, and the cell contents dialyzed. The concentrated dialysate, in a suitable buffer, is injected subcutaneously in the forearm or other convenient location of the recipient.After about twt days, the recipient is then challenged by a subcutaneous injection of the antigen at the same or another location. A typical DH reaction can be observed about one week later.Immunity thus transferred reportedly may persist in the recipient for as long as two years. Progress in fractionating and characterizing transfer factor has been impeded by the lack of associated structural or chemical criteria and by the fact that the phenomena observed after fractionation are often qualitatively different from the phenomena induced by the original dialysate. Although the term 1,transfer factor appears in literature as applied to fractionated preparations, and as monitored by criteria other than a DH skin response, it is unclear whether in such terminology the term transfer ractor is indeed used to refer to a single biochemical entity or to an activity that represents a single biological function, or rather to refer to a mixture of materials of various kinds.As used herein, the term transfer factor is restricted to the crude leukocyte dialysate as isolated by Lawrence and having an activity as originally characterized by Lawrence, i.e., the ability to transfer immunity to a specific antigen from a highly sensitive donor to a non sensitive recipient. Such dialysate may, and the inventor believes that it does, contain various different molecules and entities. Prior art fractionation of human transfer factor has demonstrated the presence of a variety of actlve materials.Vandenbark, A.A., et al., J. Immunol. 118 636 1977 , reported the results or chromatography of the dialysate of leukocyte extracts on Sephadex G 25 trademark of Pharmacia, Inc.,Uppsala, Sweden . Biological activity in vivo was found only in association with two major peaks of optical density at 254 nm or 280 nm. One such peak fraction was reported to transfer significant skin test reactivity from antigen responsive donors to previously non reactive recipients. The other peak fraction produced spontaneous activity a dermal response without added antigen and also significantly increased dermal response when combined with antigen.The peak fractions were further fractionated by isoelectric focusing and by reverse phase chromatography using a solvent system of one percent acetic acid or five percent methanol on a column bed packed with octadecyl silane resin. However, results of biological activity tests following subfractionation were not reported. Gottlieb, A.A., et al., in Transfer Factor BasicProperties and Clinical Applications, at page 263, introduced the use of fluorescamine also termed Fluram , trademark ofHoffman LaRoche, Inc., Nutley, N.J. , as a means for monitoring the fractionation of leukocyte dialysates. Fluorescamine reacts with substances containing primary amino groups to yield highly fluorescent products, providing a highly sensitive assay for proteins and other compounds bearing primary amino groups.Bohlen, P., et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 155 213 1973 .The dialyzable leukocyte extract material was fractionated on aSephadex G 1O trademark of Pharmacia, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden column. Biological activity was found associated with a major fluroescamine reactive peak. DH reactions were observed whether or not antigen was added, although response was somewhat greater in the presence of antigen. Dialyzable leukocyte extracts were further fractionated byGottlieb, A.A., et al., as reported in J. Reticuloendotbelial Soc., 21 1103 1977 . The extracts were first subjected to differential molecular weight M.W. dialysis, using dialysis membranes having nominal M.W. cutoffs of about 12,000 and about 3500, respectively. Material passing through the latter membrane, having a M.W. range generally less than 3500, was termed the S for small fraction, while material in the general M.W. range of 3500 to 12,000 was designated the l Ln for large fraction. Both fractions were subjected to gel filtration on Sephadex G lO. Biological activity was again associated with the fluorescamine reactive peak fractions.However, the activity did not appear to be a function of the immunologic state of the donor. In addition, two distinguishable effects were observed.The first was an induction of DH response in the absence of stated antigen and independent of the immunologic state of the donor or recipient. Such activity is referred to herein as inducer, as defined below. The second activity was the ability to augment intradermal reactions to antigens to which the recipient was sensitive but not to antigens to which the recipient had no prior exposure. This augmentor activity was found in the fluorescamine reactive chromatographic fractions, and appeared to augment the recipient s DH response to an antigen to which he was already sensitive. In both instances, the sensitivity of the donor appeared irrelevant. Additional fractionation of the S fraction on hydroxylapatite chromatography showed that the biological activity producing a DH response in the absence of added antigen was not associated with the main polypeptide fraction, as measured by reaction with fluorescamine. Additional data were presented by Gottlieb, A. A., et al., in J. Immunol., 124 885 1980 , on the fractionation, by means of a long, 150 cm. Sephadex G 10 column, of inducer materials those producing a DH reaction in the absence of added antigen and amplifier materials those producing a DH reaction in the presence of antigens to which the recipient is known to be sensitive . The amplifier materials were reported as remaining associated with the main fluroescamine reactive fractions, while the Inducer materials were not.It was further reported that the materials having amplitier activity remained associated with the fluorescamine reactive peak, upon further fractionation on hydroxylapatite. Controlled studies demonstrated that the reported activities were not found in similarly treated lysates of red blood cells, nor was any activity associated with a saline solution processed according to the same purification procedure. Cottlieb, A.A., et al., immune Regulators in TransferFactor A. Kahn, C. Kirkpatrick, and Hill, Eds., AcademicPress, Inc., New York, 1979 , page 339, in a report unaccompanled by data, suggested that material having an additional activity, termed suppressor , could be Separated by hydroxylapatite chromatography from material having an augmentor activity. The augmentor material was found in the S dialysis fraction M.W. under 3500 and was always associated with the major fluorescami e reactive peak. The augmentor fraction was thought to be systemically effective in previously BCG exposed anergic patients. In addition, a suppressor activity found in the L dlalysis fraction M.W.between 3500 and 12,00d was stated to elute at a higher salt concentration than the fluorescamine reactive material, on hydroxylapatite chromatography. In another study where dialyzed leukocyte extracts were fractionated, Wilson, G.B. et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med., 93 819 1979 , reported four activities affecting in vitro leukocyte migration two antigen independent activities producing a response in the absence of any antigen , an antigen dependent specific inhibitor, and an antigen dependent enhancer. The antigen dependent inhibitor had properties in common with transfer factor since only antigen of the appropriate donor specificity caused significant inhibition of in vitro leukocyte migration. The antigen dependent enhancement of leukocyte migration was not characterized with respect to antigen specificity. That activity, however, is not known to have any relationship to any in vivo function of the human immune system nor any predictable therapeutic utility. Some of the foregoing work was summarized and commented on by A. Uotila, in Transfer Factor and Other immunological Activities or Human Leukocyte Dialysate and Other Dlalys3tes orMammalian Tissues 1979 . Uotila s monograph indicates that preparations of so called transfer factor may contain a large variety of substances. Uotila suggests that an augmenting activity can be derived from dialyzable leukocyte extracts DLE in guinea pigs, but does not disclose whether this is one or several different materials or activities, or if the latter, how to separate them from one another. Uotila also suggests that augmenting activity and 1,transfer factor are similar substances, and possibly the same molecules.Uotila found alleged similarities in enzymatic sensitivity between chemical compounds in human transfer factor materials and guinea pig augmentor activity materials. It is believed that this monograph is of interest because it teaches away from the disclosure of the instant patent application. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to modulators of the human immune system. A modulator as herein defined is, in general terms, any substance or material that affects a response, whether direct or indirect, of an animal or human body, portion thereof, or matter taken therefrom, to reintroduction of antigens to which said body has been previously exposed, where such response is specifically attributable to the function of the immunity system of said animal or human. A narrower and more precise definition of the term is used subsequentlys after further characteristics of the present invention are explained.Generally, as used herein, the term modulator materials refers collectively or generically to material having modulator activity and containing one or more particular materials species causing such activity, while the term modulator refers specifically to one of the approximately eight particular, extractable materials species having an activity described herein. Substances having general bodily effects that my also include effects on the immune response are not subsu within the term modulator, as herein defined. The modulaton described herein manifest their activity in a DH skln reaction test, and therefore appear to exert their primary effect on the cell mediated immunity system. It will be understood, however, that the described modulators have broad effects on the entire immunity system, and may also affect the humoral immunity system. For purposes of discussion herein, the terms transfer factor, induced, amplifier, and 1suppressor are each defined, below, in terms of their respective activities in regard to affecting a DH response in a skin reaction. The term transfer factor denotes a dialysate of a crude leukocyte extract, as described above. A transfer factor activity is manifest when the transfer factor preparation is made from leukocytes of a donor known to be sensitive to a given antigen and is injected subcutaneously into the skin of a recipient known to be insensitive to the same antigen. The recipient is challenged, at a later time, with the antigen, and a DH response is observed. Normally, the recipient, in the absence of the injected transfer factor activity, would have been unresponsive. It will be understood that transfer factors are not modulators, as defined above, since the effect of a transfer factor is observed in a recipient who has not previously been exposed to a given antigen, while the effect of a modulator is observed only upon or following reintroduction of an antigen to which the recipient was previously exposed. Furthermore, transfer factor effects are specific with respect to a given antigen, but the amplifiers and suppressors herein described exert non specific effects with respect to any antigen to which the recipient was previously exposed. Inducer is defined as that material producing a DH response in the absence of added antigen and irrespective of the senaitivities of donor and recipient. Inducer materials are also therefore, not modulators. Amplifier material is that modulator material charactrized, in general terms, by ampllrier activity, i.e., the production or a greater than normal response faster or stronger, or both in a sensitive recipient, following injection of the antigen to which the recipient is sensitive.Amplifier activity is not dependent upon the specific immunological sensitivity of the donor. Suppressor material is that modulator material characterized by suppressor activity, which is, in general terms, that modulator activity observed in a sensitive ireclplent when the suppressor material is injected and an antigen to which the recipient is already sensitive is injected at the same time or soon thereafter, with the result that the recipient manifests a less than normal slower or weaker, or both response. In the present invention, eight specific modulators of the human immune system have been isolated from dialysates of leukocyte extracts. Six such modulators described herein have amplifier activity and two have suppressor activity.Amplifier material is considered useful in the treatment or anergic conditions and conditions of immune hyposensitivity, both local and systemic, while suppressor material is considered useful for the preparation and treatment of local hypersensitivity conditions, such as poison ivy. These six amplifiers are designated amplifiers 1 6. These two suppressors are identified as the S suppressor and theL suppressor. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT A principal contribution of the present invention lies the discovery of substances that modulate immune responsive ness. Present techniques have permitted identification or modulators which amplify or suppress the magnitude or rapidity of response to antigens to which an individual human being has been previously exposed. However, it is evident that a variety of other modulating functions are or may be manifested by substances, including duration of response, threshold of sensitivity, and type of response, such as inflammatory, proliferation of lymphocytes or production of circulating antibody. Clearly, such modulating functions will be defined in terms of the test system used to detect and measure them. The modulators of the present invention include not only amplifiers and suppressors of a DH response, but also such other manifestations of immune modulation as may be detected and measured in other appropriate test systems. The modulators herein described are therefore but part of a system of modulator substances which constitute a natural means of tintercellular communication between components of the animal including human immune system, whereby the state of immune responsiveness is continually monitored and modified in the body in accordance with the level and activity of current antigen challenge to the body. Therefore, further modulator8 are likely to be discovered, now that it is understood from the present invention that such a system of modulators exists Further investigation, employing other purification techniques and other test procedures, will result in the identification and purification of such further modulators.The present invention paves the way for such discoveries, by making known to the art the existence of such modulators and by pioneering the isolation and characterization of eight specific modulators having new and unexpected properties useful for treatment of a variety of inununity related conditions. In the following discussion, procedures are described wherein materials were obtained from human donors and test measurements were made on human recipients. The procedures and reagents used herein were chosen to provide sterile and non toxic products for human treatment. The sensitivities of donors and recipients to selected antigens were tested in advance. The initial step in the preparation of the modulator material of this invention is preparation of leukocjte pellets, followed by separation of the small M.W. under 3500 and largeM.W. 3500 to 12,000 fractions of leukocyte extract or interest herein. EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of Leukocyte Pellet Leukocytes were prepared by standard methods, r pIojtng either fractionation of whole blood samples or leukophoresis. In the former method, a 450 ml sample of whole blood was fractionated by sedimentation to separate red blood cells from leukocytes at 1 x g in Macrodex trademark of Pharmacia Corporation, Piscataway, N.J., for 6Z W V Dextran 70 in normal saline . Approximately 1 2 x 109 leukocytes were recovered by this method. Leubophoresis was preferred for obtaining larger amounts of cells, using a cell separator Haemonetics Model 30S,Haemonetics Corp., Braintree, Mass. . The system was primed with 30 cc of 46.7 trisodium citrate Haemonetics, Braintree,Mass. and 500 ml of 6 W V Volex trademark of McGaw Co.,Irvine, Calif. , which is a high molecular weight starch preparation used to enhance recovery of leukocytes from the peripheral blood and removal of red blood cells from the final leukocyte preparation by sedimentation. In either method, leukocyte rich plasma was obtained following a 60 minute incubation at 370C. The leukocytes were recovered from the plasma by centrifugation at 400 x g for 15 minutes followed by three washes with 0.15 M saline. After washing, the leukocyte pellet was stored frozen at 200C, An average yield of leukocytes from six passes in the cell separator was 1 x 1010 cells. EXAMPLE 2 Dialysis of Leukocyte Extracts Leukocyte extracts were prepared under sterile conditions, as in Example 1. Leukocyte pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate, then subjected to 10 cycles of freeze thawing in a dry ice and acetone bath. The lysate was first dialyzed against 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate, using cellulose dialysis tubing having a nominal 12,000 M.W. cutoff Arthur H. Thomas, Inc., Chicago, Ill. . The retentate or the dialysis is discarded. After three changes of buffer, the combined dialysates were lyophilized, redissolved In a small volume of ammonium bicarbonate, and dialyzed in cellulose tubing of nominal 3500 M.W. cutoff, against 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate, as before.The re ten tate from the second dialysis, termed the L for large M.W. fraction herein, and the dialysate, termed the S for small M.W. fraction herein, were each lyophilized and stored frozen at 200C until further use. EXAMPLE 3 Ultrafiltration of Leukocyte Extracts As an alternative to dialysis, the inventor has found ultrafiltration to be an expedient technique. The protocol for this technique begins with leukocyte pellets, as in Example 2.An equal volume of 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution is added to the leukocyte pellet. The resultant mixture is freezethawed 10 times in a dry ice acetone bath. The volume of the mixture is then adjusted to 50 ml by addition of ammonium bicarbonate solution, and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 6 minutes at 40C. The supernatant is saved the pellet is resuspended in 5mM ammonium bicarbonate solution and washed three times. The washes are added to the original supernatant. The pooled supernatant is filtered through an HP10 8 Amicon hollow fiber cartridge Danvers, Mass. having a M.W. cutoff of 10,000, at a flow rate of 70 80 ml min. The supernatant is continuously recycled through the Amicon hollow fiber cartridge until about 20 ml remain. The ultrafiltered fraction1 having M.W. less than approximately 10,000, is recovered and lyophilized. The material of M.W. more than approximately 10,000 is discarded. The resultant ultrafiltered fraction is freeze dried, as before, and the product is subjected to dialysis against a dialysis membrane having a M.W. cutoff of about 3500. The resultant dialysate is the wSw fraction the retentate is the L t fraction. The 12,000 M.W. cutoff of the membrane and 10,000 M.W. cutoff of the later do not make a material difference in this process. As used herein, the term dialysis applies to either of the above procedures, described in Examples 2 and 3, or any other equivalent means of separating large and small 1olecules. When the hollow fiber cartridge is used, references to the nominal M.W. cutoff of the dialysis membrane must be Understood as references to the nominal M.W. cutoff of the hollow fiber cartridge and similar equation of retentate and dialysate to ultrafiltered fraction and supernatant must be made. The next step in the preparation of modulator material is gel filtration of the S fraction, to purify the material of interest from other material, and to separate the S fraction material into a number of separate fractions having different elutability characteristics. EXAMPLE 4 Gel Filtration Sephadex G 10 trademark of Pharmacia, Inc., Uppsala,Sweden was swollen overnight in 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate, then autoclaved. After removal of the fines, a 1.5 cm x 151 cm column was prepared and equilibrated in 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The column was loaded with 400 mg of fluorescamine reactive material of the redissolved S fraction of Example 2 based upon bovine serum albumin as the assay standard, according to the method of Bohlen, P., et al., Arch.Biochem. Biophys., 155 213 1973 . The sample was eluted with 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate at a flow rate of 13 ml hr. One total column volume 254 ml was collected in 0.75 ml fractions and they were est aside. Assay of Fractions ElUraviolet absorption at 254 nm and fluorescamine reactvlty, based upon 100 microliter aliquots, were measured on the fractions of Example 4. The results are shown In Figure 1. A major fluorescamine reactive peak was observed. The pattern was essentially constant from one individual donor to another. The location of modulator activities of the fractions, in relation to the fluorescamine reactiv ty was discovered by assays modulator assays of DH response over a series of 10 rold dilutions. The nature of the DH response varied In an unexpected manner with dilution. Undiluted samples In the region of the fluorescamine peak gave a reduced DH response to an antigen relative to the control response to antigen alone. Surprisingly, at dilutions of 10 2 and 10 3, amplification of the DH responsive, relative to the control, was observed. Even more surprisingly, at dilutions of the order of suppression of the DH response was observed. The fractions displaying such unusual response properties termed modulator assayed fractions herein were selected and subjected to additional purification described below. From such experiments, the materials of interest modulator assayed 1 materials were located in a region containing the major fluorescamine reactive peak and a smaller fluorescamine reactive peak preceding the major fluorescamine reactive peak. For subsequent purification steps, fractions 152 through 178 shown in Figure 1 were pooled and lyophilized. The possibility exists that final yields can be improved by pooling additional fractions on either side of those chosen. The optimal choice of fractions is not as yet determined. In some experiments gel filtration was carried out using a shorter 80 cm column of Sephadex G 10. The results were comparable, except that the longer column gave improved resolution. In particular, an antigen independent inducer was separated from the main fluorescamine reactive peak on the longer column. As an alternative to gel filtration, purifications can be carried out by high performance gel exclusion chromatography, using a 1 x 25 cm column of sulfonated polystyrene divinyl benzene having a 5000 M.W. exclusion limit Shodex S 802 S, manufactured by Showa Denko KK, Tokyo, Japan , eluted with water at the rate of 0.8 ml min. The term gel filtrationw as used herein should therefore be understood to inciude the foregoing equivalent purtrication means and other equivalents. Reverse Phase Chromatography Further purification of the material of Example 4 was carried out by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC using an octadecyl silane O.S. resin column cluted with a O to 100 v v gradient or etbanol in water. All percentage references to ethanol in water gradlents herein are on a v v basis. The inventor has used two different versions of the HPLC process, with two respective O.S. columns. The first method was with a 0.26 cm I.D. x 25 cm analytic column packed withPerkin Elmer ODS HC SIL X 1 octadecyl silane resin. To achieve greater output, the second method used a 2.3 cm I.D. x 28 cm preparative column packed with the same O.S. resin.Both columns were used with a Series 3B Perkin Elmer high pressure liquid chromatograph, but the elution characteristics of the two columns differ substantially, as explained below. The Perkin Elmer Series 3B High Pressure LiquidChromatograph can be programmed to operate at a specified flow rate, such as 0.5 ml min. Samples can then be collected at 2.0 minute intervals. The 0 to 100 ethanol in water gradient can be programmed to run, for example, from 0 to 100 ethanol in 60 minutes. This, in principle, divides the gradient into 30 2 minute intervals, during each of which a 1.0 ml sample is collected. Each such 1.0 ml sample should, in principle, represent a 100 30 or 3.33 change in ethanol concentration.The visual display of the Perkin Elmer machine shows the ethanol concentration going into the column in accordance with the foregoing data. However, the actual ethanol concentration in the efrluent from the column as measured by refractive indices or effluent calibrated against a standard curve of ethanol in waR appears, in the earlier portions of the gradient, to be substantially less than the concentration of ethanol being programmed at that moment into the machine. For e Liple, in the analytic column procedure, at a flow rate ot 0.5 ml min, the display of the Perkin Elmer machine indicates an apparent concentration of ethanol of 45 when the concentratIx In in the effluent is actually 36 . In the preparative column procedure, at a flow rate of 5.0 ml min, the display indicates a 32 apparent concentration when the actual concentration in the effluent is 13 .This result comes from a varietior factors. Such factors include size of the particular column, internal volume of the column, and the volume of tubes and connections leading into and out of the column. It is possible to calibrate these columns, and important to do so in order to facilitate repeatable results. This can be done expediently by measurement of the effluent s refractive index and calculating actual ethanol concentration therefrom. In the following Table A, the calibration at 240C is shown for the preparative column and several flow rates of interest.These data do not specifically relate to fractions of the effluent that are of special interest. They merely illustrate the need for calibration and the calibration trends. The translation from refractive index to actual concentration of ethanol is based on measurement of 100 water, Sterile Water for Injection, U.S.P. Cutter Labs, Berkeley, Calif. , 240C, refractive index 1.3325 100 ethanol, Punctilious EthylAlcohol, Dehydrated, 200 Proof, U.S.P. U.S. IndustrialChemicals Co., Tuscola, Ill. , 24 C, refractive index 1.3610.Each refractive index value shown in Table A is the mean of four measurements. It should be noted that values for U.S.P. materials may differ from values for C.P. materials. However, U.S.P. materials should be used in these procedures, since the materials prepared are for human use. Further, it should be noted that the refractive index values shown here are based on use of a refractometer and ordinary light bulb, not Na light.

The 0.5 ml min analytic column curve is that furthest to the right. To its left is the curve for 5 ml min and the preparative column. To the left of that is the curve for 6 ml min and the same column, and so on. It is believed that the best results are reallzed by using refractive index, rather than elution time or tube number, as a measure of actual EtOH concentration, the latter being the factor directly related to the solubility and chemical structure of the materials of interest. Accordingly, refractive index data are used hereafter to identify the modulators in this specification and in the claims thereof. In referring to gradient composition, however, it was deemed more appropriate to describe the separation process in terms of viv percentage composition, because that is the basis on which ethanol and water are mixed to form the gradient. EXAMPLE 5 HPLC on Analytic Column The material of Example 4 was purified and separated by HPLC on the analytic column, as described above, yielding 34 effluent fractions 30 plus 4 more at the end, after inputting pure ethanol, to fine tune the high concentration part of the gradient , which were each set aside. Refractive index measurements were made on the effluent fractions at selected intervals in the process. The pertinent ethanol concentration data are tabulated below, in Table B.

The dermal responses at 24 hours were measured. The results are shown in Figure 2. In the separation shown in Figure 2, the material was obtained from a donor person who was insensitive to the antigen streptoklnase hereinafter SK . The recipient person was known to be sensitive to streptokinase. The extent of his dermal reaction to SK in the absence of any modulators is presented as a horizontal line in Figure 2. DH responses above the line show amplifier activity, while responses below the normal level suggest suppressor activity. For reference, also indicated in Figure 2 are the positions of the fractions containing fluorescamine reactive material and of various small molecules serotonin, histamine, ascorbic acid, nicotinamide, and hydrocortisone phosphate known to be vasoactive, inflammatory, or anti inflammatory.The solid line of the graph shows the dermal reactivity of individual fractions in the concentrations obtained from the gradient. EXAMPLE 7 Pool Assay, Dlluted The results of assays of individual fractions were copared with activity tests made with pooled fractions 0 10, 1 20, and 20 30 administered at several dilutions. Paradoxically, at higher dilution, the pooled 10 20 fractions manifested the maximum observed amplifier activity. The dilution effect of individual fraction 5, having maximal amplifier 1 activity, and fraction 14, were measured in a person sensitive to SK. The results were expressed by measurement in millimeters of the dimensions of the regions of erythema and of induration, at 7 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours after injection of antigen and modulator. The modulators were diluted in normal saline. These data are given in Table 1. In the case of amplifier 1 fraction 5 of Figure 2 , it ia seen from Table 1 that strong acceleration of response and augmentation of response were observed at all tested levels of dilution, suggesting saturation of the test site at all concentrations studied. However, with fraction 14, it is seen fromTable I that significant augmentation was observed.only upon dilution by a.factor of 10 to 1000. Therefore, a clear cut optimum concentration for amplifier 2 activity was observed. A degree of acceleration of response was also observed, although less pronounced than than produced by amplifier 1. The two apparent peaks of amplifier activity obtained by the measurement of undiluted samples in Figure 2 do not necessarily reflect the true positions of the amplifiers in all preparations.There are several reasons for this. First, different donors have different levels of the various modulators in their leukocytesThey may also have other substances in their leukocytes that affect the preparation. There is also biological variability in the test recipient. Finally, there is the paradoxical effect ot concentration in the case of amplifier 2. In particular, in Figure 2, the decreased activity in the region of fractions 12 through 18 is clearly a consequence of above optimal concentrations or amplifier 2 in this region. When optimally diluted, a peak of amplifier 2 activity should be observable in the region or fractions 14 through 16. This conclusion is represented by the dashed line in Figure 2, which is a hypothetical curve or amplifier 2 activity measured at optimum dilution. Pooled fractions 21 30 had S suppressor activity. When injected concurrently with antigen the S suppressor effectively prevented the appearance of a DH response at 6 or 24 hours after injection. In contrast, a clear cut DH response was observed at 24 hours where antigen was injected alone, and an even stronger response was observed where amplifiers 1 or 2 were also present.The results are shown in Figure 3. The patient s left arm received a series of subcutaneous injections of PPD mixed with pooled fractions of the gradient shown in Figure 2 at 1 10 and 1 100 dilutions, as indicated on the patient s arm HP 1 pooled fractions 1 10 designated HP PK 1 on the patient s arm HP 2 fractions 11 20 designated HP PK 2 and HP 3 fractions 21 30 designated HP PK 3. The control injection of PPD alone was made on the patients right arm. Increased inflammation, compared to control, is observable at the sites injected with pooled HP 1 and HP 2, due to the presence of amplifiers in these fractions.However, reduced inflammation is observed at HP 3 treated sites, due to the presence of suppressor activity, which appears to predominate over the activity of any amplifiers in this fraction.The S suppressor activity was observed in pooled fractions 21 30 of the HPLC separation, in most donors. In some instances,S suppressor activity could be found in single fractions, e.g., fraction 29 of Figure 2. However, suppressor activity or single fractions was not consistently observed in all preparations and the presence of such activity proved to depend upon the donor individual. When individual fractions in the region from 20 to 30 or theHPLC separation were assayed at several dilutions, the existence of amplifiers 3, 4, and 5 was discovered. The peak of amplifier 3 activity appeared in fractions 21 and 22, while amplifier 4 activity was centered in fraction 25, and amplifier 5 activity was found chiefly in fractions 27 and 28. S suppressor wa3 round in fractions 29 and 30. The results are shown in Figure q, showing analysis of a representative chromatographic run.In FIgure 4, DH response relative to controls was plotted as the extent or dermal reaction, defined as a x b a x b , where a and b are diameters in millimeters of the erythematous lesion resulting from injections of fraction plus antigen, measured along mutually perpendicular axes, and a and b1 are the respective diameters of the control lesion resulting from injection of antigen alone. The extent of dermal reaction is therefore the difference between the approximate areas of lesions produced by antigen alone and antigen mixed with modulator. Values appreciably below the control level of zero, such as those observed in fractions 29 and 30, indicate suppressor activity, while values appreciably above zero indicate amplifier activity.It should be noted that the pattern in Figure 4 is compatible with that of Figure 2, when one considers the results of the odd numbered fractions which were the only fractions assayed in the experiment shown in Figure 2. Amplifier 6 was eluted from the HPLC column after the ethanol water gradient had reached an apparent concentration or 99.9 ethanol, by continuing the elution of the column with 100 ethanol at 0.5 ml min. collecting 1 ml fractions. Amplifier 6 was detected in tubes 32 through 34 under these conditions, with the greatest apparent concentration in tube 33. Amplifier 6 caused an accelerated and augmented response to antigens to which the recipient was sensitive. A dose equivalent to the yield from 2 x 108 leukocytes in the described purification improved, and in some instances restored, the DH response of patients rendered weakly responsive by intercurrent illness, to antigens to which they were previously exposed. In general, the responses to amplifier 6 were enhanced by dilution, although the optimal dilution was variable with the individual recipient and perhaps depended upon the antigen as well. Table 4 shows the results of two dilution experiments.In part A, a stretokinase sensitive recipient received 2.5 units of streptokinase simultaneously with the amplifier. 1.0 ml fractions of amplifier collected from the HPLC column was lyophilized and redissolved in 0.3 ml normal saline. 0.1 ml of the indicated fractions, diluted to the extent shown, with normal saline, was injected. In part B, a PPD sensitive recipient was injected with 0.05 ml of a 1 10 dilution of standard Aplisol PPD, together with the dilution of amplifier 6 indicated, in 0.1 ml saline, or with 0.1 ml of normal saline alone as a control. Material with amplifier activity is extractable from aqueous solution with ether. The extractable material requires dilution for maximal activit. The ether extract is therefore presumed to contain at least some of the described amplifiers. However, it is not known which of the described amplifiers are ether extractable.Reverse phase chromatographic separation of the above described modulators can be carried out using a variety of known reverse phase column materials known in the art. While conditions of elution may vary, the optimal conditions for separating the above described modulators will be readily determined by those of ordinary skill in the art. On the basis of the foregoing data, it is possible to characterize amplifiers 1 6 and S suppressor more precisely. It is also possible to describe more precisely the procedures for purifying them and separating them from one another and from other materials. Amplifiers 1 6 and S suppressor are all characterized by a MW. under 3500, and b being O.S. elutable with an ethanol in water gradient. As used hereinafter, O.S. elutable with an ethanol in water gradient, means capable of being eluted from.octadecyl silane by means of reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography with an ethanol in water gradient or increasing ethanol concentration. The property of being O.S. elutable permits the further characterization and separation of these seven modulators because they can be ordered in terms or their relative solubility or elutability. Amplifier 1 is O.S. elutable in the portion of the gradient containing only 0 1Z ethanol in the effluent. Amplifier 2 is O.S. elutable only in a greater concentration of ethanol, and so on, until Amplifier 6 is reached, which is O.S. elutable only in almost pure ethanol. Each of these modulators can therefore be characterized in terms of four parameters 1 the given modulator is substantially entirely O.S. elutable in a specific zone of the gradient, from lower concentration limit a to upper concentration limit b 2 The modulator is substantially not O.S. elutable in the zone of the gradient below a 3 the modulator, when properly purified, is substantially free of material O.S. elutable in the zone below a and the the modulator, when properly purified, is substantlally free of material O.S. elutable only in the zone above b. The third and fourth items may warrant further explanation.If an ethanol in water gradient is used that begins at a concentration in the middle or upper part of the range, e.g., 80 , then the first fraction that comes off will contain substantially all of the material 0.8. elutable from 0 to 80 . Therefore, to properly purify material O.S. elutable from 80 to 88 , the gradient should begin below 80 , e.g., at 70 or Oa, so that all the material elutable in ethanol less concentrated than 80 will come off the column before the material elutable at 80 to 88 begins to come ofr. Otherwise, an ineffective purification will occur. This explains the presence of item 3 above. The fourth item states a characteristic that should automatically occur in any procedure using a gradient of increasing concentration. If the gradient begins, e.g., at 80 or below, and stops at 88Z or above, what elutes between 80 and 88 will be free of material O.S. elutable only at higher ethanol concentrations, such as 90 . This indicates, of course, that ethanol concentration in the gradient should always monotonically increase with time, in a proper purification procedure. That is the customary methodology. The following table, Table C, characterizes these seven smallM.W. modulators in terms of the four parameters discussed above.The data in Table C is essentially the same as that of Table B, above, presented in a different form. The horizontal lines ot Table B separate the seven elution zones of interest with regard to these seven modulators. The basis of selection of the data tabulated in Table C was the result of dilution as says such as those of Figure 4. That is, the seven zones were defined by the assays.

The reactions produced by amplifier 1 administered with antigen reach peak intensity at about 6 to 14 hours after subcutaneous injection and fade rapidly thereafter. In contrast, normal DH response, in the absence of amplifier, reaches a peak 24 to 30 hours after injection of antigen, Amplifier 1 is O.S. elutable between approximately 0 to 12 v v ethanol concentration, that is, in the portion Or the ethanol in water HPLC gradient where the effluent has a refractive index of from approximately 1.332 to 1.336. The 1.336 refractive index figure and 125 concentration figure represent data from the use of the preparative column. Table C reflects only data rrom the use of the analytic column, which has shown a narrower elution range for amplifier 1. Amplifier 1 is not demonstrably reactive with fluorescamine, and is separated from the main peak of fluorescamine reactivity onHPLC.Amplifier 1 passes through a dialysis membrane having a nominal M.W. cutoff of 3500, so that the M.W. of amplifier 1 may be presumed to be less than 3500. Amplifier 2 Amplifier 2 also causes both an accelerated and augmented response to antigen, although the degree of acceleration is somewhat less rapid than the response to amplifier 1. Reaction sites are more circumscribed than those produced by amplifier 1 plus antigen, and they persist considerably longer up to seven days .Most suprisingly, maximal amplifying activity with amplifier 2 is observable only at an optimum concentration, with greater than optimal concentrations giving reduced amplification or even suppres sion of the DH response. Amplifier 2 is O.S. elutable in the portions of the foregoing ethanol in water gradient between approximately 28 to 502, where the refractive index of the effluent is from approximately 1.340 to 1.347. Otherwise, amplifier 2 has the properties of amplifier 1 described above. In addition, it has been observed that amplifier 2 is stable to heating for 30 minutes at 560C, but loses its activity if heated for 30 minutes at 900C. As in the case of amplifier 1, the immediately preceding concentration and refractive index data refiect data from the use of the preparative column, while Table C reflects data from the analytic column, which has a narrower elution range for amplifier 2. Amplifiers 3 6 Amplifiers 3, 4, 5, and 6 cause augmented response to antigen. Dilution studies indicate that the activity of amplifiers 3, 5, and 6 is enhanced by dilution. The activity of amplifier 4 may also be so enhanced, but the data is more equivocal. Amplifier 6 has been shown to have systemic effects. Otherwise, amplifiers 3 to 6 have substantially the properties of amplifier 1 described above,Amplifiers 3 to 6 are O.S. elutable in the approximate Potions of the gradient indicated below in Table D. Data for amplifiers 1 and 2 are also restated for comparison. Table D Ethanol Concentration Data for Amplifiers Amplifier Ethanol concentration Refractive index 1 0 to 12 v v 1.332 to 1.336 2 28 to 50 1.340 to 1.347 3 65 to 80 1.353 to 1.355 4 81 to 91 1.356 to 1.358 5 92 to 97 1.359 to 1.360 6 99 to 100 1.361 to 1.362 S Suppressor S suppressor is characterized as having a temporary suppres sing eLf sÏt on DH response to the reintroduction of an antigen that previously challenged the subject. The effect lasts about 48 hours, after which DH response returns. S suppressor has this suppressing effect when administered before or substantially concurrently with the antigen, but not when administered six hours or more after the antigen. S suppressor also is capable of affecting the phenomenon of leukocyte migration inhibition. Ordinarily, when leukocytes from a sensitive individual are exposed to an antigen to which the individual is sensitive, the leukocytes lose their ability to migrate in a fluid or semi solid medium. This phenomenon of leukocyte migration inhibition is reversed by S suppressor, if S suppressor is present at an optimal concentration. In effect, S suppressor inhibits the phenomenon of leukocyte migration inhibition permitting the leukocytes to migrate normally. The phenomenon of leukocyte migration inhibition in the presence of antigen is known to be correlated with a state of delayed hypersensitivity to that antigen. The reversal of leukocyte migration inhibition by S suppressor is therefore believed by the inventor to be correlated withS suppressor s suppression of a DH response. S suppressor is isolated from the dlalysate passing through a membrane having a nominal 3500 M.W. cutoff, so that it too may be presumed to have M.W. less than 3500. S suppressor is identifiable and separable from amplifiers 1 to 6 by HPLC. S suppressor Is O.S.elutable in fractlons eluting from approximately 97 to 99S ethanol, where the refractive index of the effluent is from approximately 1.3600 to approximately 1.3608. S suppressor is not demonstrably reactive with fluorescamine, as judged by its separability from the major fluorescamine reactive peak on HPLC. Suppression of a DH skin reaction is manifested whenS suppressor is inJected before or concurrently with a test antigen to which the recipient gives a DH response. Suppression is reversible or shdrt acting, in effect delaying the onset of the DH response about 72 hours. Suppression is not observed when amplifier 2 is injected concurrently with S suppressor. L Suppressor An eighth modulator, designated herein as L suppressor, is found in that fraction of the leukocyte extract passing through a dialysis membrane having a nominal 12,000 M.W. cutoff, but retained by membrane having a 3500 M.W. cutoff, so that M.W. may be presumed to be greater than 3500 and less than approximately 12,000.L suppressor activity is reversible, like that of S suppressor, having a suppressing effect lasting about 72 hours. L suppressor is not fluorescamine reactive, as judged by the fact that it is separable from the major fluorescamine reactive peak, upon hydroxy lapatite chromatography. The following Examples 8 and 9 exemplify the purification procedure for preparing L suppressor. EXAMPLE 8 Fractionation of the L Dialysis Fraction The L dialysis fraction of Example 2 or Example 3, which is an equivalent of Example 2 was further fractionated by chromato graphy on hydroxylapatite. After removal of fines, hydroxylapatite previously equilibrated with 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate was packed in a 1.5 x 20 cm column. The L fraction, lyophilized and redis solved in 0.05 M ammonium bicarbonate, was applied to the column. The column was eluted with a gradient of 0.05 M to 0.2 N aqueous ammonium bicarbonate 115 ml , followed by a gradient of 0.2 M to 0.6 M ammonium bicarbonate 65 ml . 1 ml fractions were collected and set aside. EXAMPLE 9 Assay of L Fraction The 1 ml fractions or Example 8 were monitored for absorbance at 260 nm and reactivities with fluorescamine. Individual fractions were pooled in seven combined fractions spanning most of the gradient. The combined fractions were analyzed for biological activity by injecting each fraction intradermally in the presence of an antigen to which the recipient individual was sensltive. The results are shown in Table 2. Relative DH response is indicated inTable 2 by the diameter of the region of induration, in millimeters, measured at 25 and 43 hours, compared to a control reaction site wherein antigen alone was injected. Fractions 450 and 451, eluting between 0.1 M and 0.15 M ammonium bicarbonate were those of interest. They strongly suppressed the DH reaction for at least 113 hours. At 72 hours, reactions measuring 10 mm x 10 mm were seen at sites receiving. fractions 450 and 451, indicating that the suppressor activity is temporary and reversible over time. It was believed desirable to use controls to test the validity of the foregoing data. Several such experiments are described below. Red Cell Control Dialyzed red blood cell extracts were prepared in the same fashion that leukocyte extracts were prepared in Example 2. Dif ferential dialysis and column chromatography on Sephadex G 10 were performed as described above. No immune modulator activity was observed in the resulting fractions. Therefore, it was concluded that the observed biological activity was not introduced by the extraction and purification steps. In addition, extracts of platelets subjected to identical purification steps, were devoid of modulator activity. Some of the purified amplifiers have been re chromatographed and found to behave in essentially the manner observed during initial purification. Transfer Factor Control In view of the significant body of prior art dealing with transfer factor, it was important to show, as unequivocally as possible, that the observed amplifications of recipient sensitivity were not in fact due to the transfer of a low level sensitivity, previously undetected in the donor, which, when cOncentrated, would appear as amplified sensitivity in a recipient. The experimental strategy used herein was based upon testing for antigens having geographically localized prevalence or having a medically traceable source. PPD, a purified protein derivative of tubercle bacillus, is both medically traceable and geographically localized. Sensitivity to PPD occurs in individuals with a prior history of vaccination with BCG Bacille Calmette Guerin , widely used to immunize against tuberculosis in Europe. However, its use has not been approved in the United States. Histoplasmin is a geographically localized antigen. Sensitiv ity to histoplasmin is widespread in the southern United States and in tropical regions, where histoplasmosis is endemic. But sensitivity to histoplasmin is not found in northern Europe, where histoplasmin does not occur. In the control experiment, the donor, a native or the southeastern United States, was skin test sensitive to histoplasmin, but was non reactive to PPD. The recipients were lifetime residents of the United Kingdom with either a demonstrable skin test sensitivity to PPD or prior history of vaccination with BCG. The amplifier preparation e nployed in this experiment was purified as described, through the Sephadex G 10 fractionation step, except that a shorter, 80 cm column with somewhat lower resolution was employed.Consequently, test material was a mixture of amplifiers 1 6 andS suppressor, in addition to fluorescamine reactive material. The results are nevertheless significant as proof of the lack of transfer factor activity in the preparation. The results are shown in Table 3. Two recipients were each tested with two fluorescamlne reactive peak fractions number 33 and 34 of the Sephadex column . Each fraction, 2.4 mg based upon fluorescamine reactivity, was injected either alone or with 25 units of PPD. Fourteen hours after the initial injection, the sites which had not previously received antigen were challenged with histoplasmin, using 0.1 ml of Histoplasmin Antigen prepar ation of Parkc Davis Corp., Detroit, Mich., sold as 1f100 WfV dilution in normal saline . Control sites, with PPD or hlsto plasmin injected alone, at the appropriate time, were also prepared. In Table 3, the intensity of the dermal skin reaction is expressed in terms of the diameter in mm of the zone of induration surrounding the injection site. The data show that the recipients lacked any capacity to react with histoplasmin, either before or after injection of leukocyte extract fractions. Both the accelerating and augmenting aspects of amplifier activity are observable. On the other hand, no transfer of histoplasmin sensitivity is observable. Systemic Effect Experiment Sarcoidosis An important aspect of the amplifier activities described herein is their systemic effectiveness. Furthermore, their systemic effects can be observed in anergic patients those who have lost their normal immune responsiveness due to illness .Patients with a history of BCG vaccination and who were currently non responsive to PPD as a result of illness could be rendered responsive to PPD by a subcutaneous injection of the amplifier fraction described in Example B, supra, using a 10 to 100 fold higher dose of the amplifier. Response to the antigen was not localized to the site of amplifier injection. Systemic effects were also dramatically demonstrated in a series of experiments using amplifier 6. A patient with a fouryear history of sarcoidosis displayed extremely weak responses to all antigens. The following series of tests was performed. On day 1 of the test, the patient was administered tetanus toxoid, alone and in combination with amplifier 6 at several dilutions. The results, shown in Table 5, showed a weak erythematous response without induration to tetanus toxoid alone, and some slight amplifica tion of response with amplifier 6. However, there was no induration at any of the test sites, indicating that the patient was not responding appropriately.On day 2 of the test, the patient re ccived a subcutaneous injection of amplifier 6 from fraction 33 of the reverse phase chromatography, in an amount equivalent to that extractable from approximately 2 x 108 lcukocytes. On day 8 of the test, the patient was again challenged with tetanus toxold, alone and in combination with several dilutions of amplifier 6, as before. However, this time there was a substantial response to amplifier 6, with some induration noted, as shown in Table 5. The results indicate a substantially increased responsiveness to the antigen, modulated by a systemic effect of the injection of ampli fier 6 administered on day 2. Systemic Effect Experiment Lymphocyte Activation Further evidence or the systemic effect of amplifier 6 is provided by measurement of responsiveness of the patient s peripheral blood lymphocytes to activation in vitro. Lymphocyte activation is a well known phenomenon. A sample of peripheral blood lymphocytes of normal individuals is induced to proliferate in cell culture by a variety of known activating agents, including various plant mitogens and phytohemagglutinin hereinafter PHA .The rate of proliferation is manifested by uptake of 3H thymidine from the culture medium into DNA of the dividing cells. The test procedure is described by Oppenheim, J.J., et awl., in In VitroMethods of Cell Mediated and Tumor Immunity Bloom and David, eds. , pp. 573 585, Academic Press, New York, N.Y. 1976 . Samples of peripheral lymphocytes were obtained from the patient on day 2 and day 8 of the above described test, and assayed for response to a variety of activating agents. The results are shown in Table 6. Day 2 lymphocytes were well below the normal response level, while day 8 lymphocytes displayed normal or increased responsiveness to two of the three activators.Therefore, a substantial systemic response to the subcutaneous injection of amplifier 6 had occurred. In the foregoing experiments, pokeweed mitogen was obtained from Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, N.Y. PHA and concanavalln A were obtained from Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Michigan. The results in Table 6 are expressed as counts per minute of 3H thymidine uptake. On the basis of experimental results on individual volunteers, it is believed that recipients having non genetic anergic or hypoimmune conditions can be treated to increase immune rcsponslveness by the above described amplifiers. Some Or the experimental results on volunteers were obtained using material purified by Sephadex G 10 chromatography, presumably comprising a mixture of amplifiers. A preferred embodiment of the contemplated method pf treatment Is described as follows. EXAMPLE 10 Increase of Immune Response Amplifiers 1 6 are prepared and purified as described inExample 1 5, using HPLC. Active fractions are pooled, lyophilizf and redissolved in normal saline or other physiologically acceptable vehicle. An effective dose, e.g., 0.1 ml containing equivalent amount of amplifiers 1 6 purified from 5 x 107 leukocytes, is injected subcutaneously. Increased immune responsiveness is monitored by the patient s reactivity to an antigen to which he is known to be sensitive, comparing reacti before and after administering the amplifiers. The amplifiers administered either individually, or in combination, depending the desired effects.The persistence of the systemic modulat produced by administration of the amplifiers varies from pati patient, and must therefore be monitored periodically with a suitable sensitivity test, as described. Additional doses a administered as required to maintain a desired amplificatior immunity based upon the professional judgment of the attend physician. The amplifiers, either singly or in combination, can be used to produce an immune response to weak vaccines. Many pathagens including several Staphylococcus varieties and fungi responsible.for Histoplasmosis or Candidiasis, fail to provoke a strong response in certain patients. Moreover, there is no known satisfactory vaccine for conferring immunity on such patients.Such fungal infections are especially dangerous for patients subjected to cancer chemotheraphy, or immunosuppressive drugs. By enhancing the patients immune response to weak antigens the concurrent administration of the described amplifiers singly or in combination, makes it possible to prepare vaccines against such pathogens. Patients about to receive chemotherany, or transplant surgery, can thus be vaccinated prior to treatment to reduce their susceptibility to histoplasmosis or candidiasis. Used as described below, amplifiers 1 6 are expected to expand the scope of preventative measures in medicine, and to enlarge the range of weak antigens which can be used for immunization. EXAMPLE 11 Vaccination Vaccine is preferably prepared by combining amplifiers 1 6 with antigens of the desired pathogen, prepared according to known methods in the art to ensure adequate attenuation and sterility.The vaccine is then administered by standard procedures. Severe skin reactions to poison ivy or other contact hypersensitivity reactions are preventable by treatment withS suppressor. Such a treatment would proceed on the basis of the known fact that the major portion of contact dermatitis reactions, such as that of poison ivy or other allergens, is a DH reaction. EXAMPLE 12 Suppression of Contact Dermatitis S suppressor is purified and incorporated into a salve or ointment suitable for topical application, such as a cold cream base composition. Since the yield of observed suppressor activity obtained from individual donors is variable, the applied dosage must be expressed in terms of activity units. One suppressor unit may be defined as the minimum amount necessary to reduce the diameter of induration in an individual s DH response, by 5 mm. Using this definition, the skin area of the patient to be treated should receive a dose of at least one suppressor unit per 100 cm2, which is an effective doseage amount, with larger doses being administered if clinically indicated. Treatment should be continued as long as there is danger of exposure, with reapplications at least every seven days, but more frequently if clinically indicated. The response or individual patients will vary depending upon their degree of sensitivity to the antigen, and their responsiveness to suppressor.Such compositions may also advantageously include steroids or other anti inflammatory agents to enhance their therapeutic effect. EXAMPLE 13 Prevention of Contact Dermatitis Severe poison ivy and other contact skin reactions are preventable by the administration of L suppressor. Again, the known DH component of such skin reactions indicates the effectiveness of such a therapeutic approach. Active fractions from hydroxylapatite chromatography should be pooled, lyophilized, and incorporated into a salve or ointment composition suitable for topical application. Where the reaction is generalized, parenteral administration may be preferred. Dosage and method of treatment follow essentially as described in the preceding example. The L suppressor material and S suppressor material may be applied separately, or mixed together in a single composition. GENERAL CONCLUDING REMARKS The above described modulators of the immune system are considered to be materials whose natural function is regulation of the immune response, directly with respect to cell mediated immunity and perhaps indirectly affecting humoral immunity as well.The materials have been prepared with a high degree of purity such that their properties have now been characterized and shown to be entirely and unexpectedly different from transfer factor and from partial fractionations thereof reported in the prior art. It will be understood, however. that the materials disclosed and claimed herein are defined in terms of their biological activities and physical properties and do not necessarily consist of single molecules or chemical entities. The amplifier and suppressor materials herein described are medically useful for the treatment of patients suffering from a variety of hyperimmune and hypoimmune conditions. It is especially significant that these materials may be isolated from normal individuals, rather than from specific identified donors, so that large scale purification from pooled sources is feasible. On the basis of the preceding data and discussion, it is now also possible to define and to characterize more preclsely some of the terms used herein.Modulators The terms modulator and modulator material are generically applied to all of the biologically active materials of this invention. They are derived from leukocytes. They are in purified form, and in particular are purified substantially free of fluorescamine reactive substances. They affect a response, whether direct or indirect, of the immunity system of an animal or human body, portion of said body, or matter taken from said body. The response is to the reintroduction of antigens to which the animal or human body was previously exposed the response occurs upon or following the reintroduction of such an antigen the response is specifically attributable to a function of the immunity system. As used herein, generally, modulator material is collective and has several different components, each component being termed a modulator. The given modulator or specimen of modulator material used for any biological purpose is substantially free of other material, such as a second modulator, that has an opposite effect to the effect of the given modulator on the immune system. That is, modulator material is a generic term for material containing amplifiers, or suppressors, or other modulators. This can include a mixture of amplifiers or a mixture of suppressors. But the term is not used to refer to a mixture in which both amplifier material and suppressor material are present at the same time, as such a mixture would contain mutually antagonistic or nullifying ingredients.Usually the term modulator is applied to a particular, even though not specifically designated, species member of the genus of modulator, such as amplifier 3 orL suppressor.Human Modulators There is a major subgenus of modulators, human modulators,n In human modulator material, the leukocytes from which the material is derived are human leukocytes, and the kind or immune response of a body that the modulator material affects is that of a human body. A human modulator is an individual substance present in human modulator material. The human modulators of principal interest herein are those modulators that increase or decrease the speed or magnitude of immune response. This principal subgenus does not include those modulators, referred to but not described herein, that prImarIly modulate other aspects of immunity response, such as duration of response, threshold of sensitivity, and type of response e.g., proliferation of lymphocytes . Amplifiers Amplifier material is human modulator material that increases the speed accelerates onset of or increases the magnitude augments the immune response, or does both. Amplifier material includes at least six specific amplifiers. The six disclosed herein are designated by the numbers 1 to 6. These are all S fraction M.W. under 3500 and O.S. elutable modulators.Other amplifiers may hereafter be extracted by extrapolation fro the teachings of this disclosure. The six claimed amplifier species designated by the numbers 1 6 are all characterized by the four parameters referred to previously, in terms of the respective zones in which they are C elutable, and below which they are not O.S. elutable, as well a their purification from and freedom from materials O.S. elutablf outside that zone. The six approximate zones are tabulated abo in Table D. The same zones of Table D are used in the claims hereinbelow.Suppressors Suppressor material is human modulator material that decreases the speed of onset of or decreases the magnitude of immune response. A suppressor is a particular kind of such material. The invention includes two specific suppressors,S suppressor and L suppressor. S suppressor is an S fraction material, characterized in terms of the same parameters as amplifiers 1 6. L suppressor is characterized in terms of its 3500 12,000 M.W. and its elutability characteristics. The invention is also considered to include the novel processes for purification and extraction of these new material described herein, as well as the novel compositions including materials and the methods using them, disclosed herein. While the invention has been described in connection with specific and preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood that it is capable of further modifications without deDarting the spirit and scope of the invention. This application is intended to cover all variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention, following, in general, the principles of the invention and including such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice within the art to which the invention pertains. For example, as the terms dialysis and dialyzed through a dialysis membrane are used herein, they should be understood to include equivalent methods of separating molecules and or biological activities of different sizes and or weights.Thus, dialysis as used herein includes ultrafiltration, ultracentrifugation, and electrophoresis. As another example, gel filtration includes gel exclusion chromatography on a high performance liquid chromatographic system.
