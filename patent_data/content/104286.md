## Description
CLAMPING DEVICES This invention relates to clamping devices, such as manual benchvices, mechanical lathe vices, or hand vices, lathe chucks or robot hands. In conventional vices, the clamping jaws are fixed and have ridges tr gripping. In the case of work pieces having an irregular shape, the clamping jaws can only clamp a work piece at some places. As a result, the clamping is not firm and stable in use. An object of the invention is to overcome this problem. According to this invention, I propose a clamping device including one or more clamp members for contacting an object to be clamped and which are movable into a selected angular orientation in contact with an object to be clamped, and means for holding the or each clamp member tightly against an object. The clamping mouth comprises two or more slidable jaws, and slidable clamp members. The clamping surface formed by the clamp members may be angdarly varied to adapt to the surface of a work piece for the purpose of firmly clamping it. Also, on both sides of the vice mouth or on the base, an auxiliary stop piece may be provided to provide a 1zsr contact surface for the work piece for further stabling effect. Moreover, the auxiliary stop piece may be moved mannually or by a motor or hydraulic or pneumatic means and it may also be furnished, on its contact surface with one or mom ridges for gripping a work piece or one or more slidable clamp members.

Figures 12A and 12B show an eighth embodiment of the vice of the present invention Figure 13A, 13B and 13C show a ninth embodiment in which a guide screw is employed to hold the positioning jaw firmly Figure 14 shows a tenth embodiment of vice of this invention, in which a manual clamp is furnished with a slidable clamp member Figure 15 shows an deveWh embodiment of vice of this invention, in which a lathe chuck is furnished with a slidable clamp member Figure 16 shows a twelfth embodiment of vice of this invention, in which a robot hand is furnished with a slidable clamp member. In a first embodiment of a vice, the vice mouth comprises a positioning jaw 1 and a slidable jaw 2 and the clamping surface of the vice is formed by slid√Öable clamp members 3, .3 , which are semi cireular in can view, and have an arcuate through slot 32,32 respectively. They may be made of any convenient material, either hard or soft, and in any convenient shape. On the clamping surfaces 31,31 of the clamp members 3,3 , a number of gripping ridges are furnished, and at the centre of the surfaces 31,31 , a V shaped groove 33 to aid gripping a contacting surface is furnished. On each of the positioning jaw 1 and the sliding jaw 2, a channel of shape complementary to the clamp members 12,22 is furnished to accommodate each of the slidableclamp members 3,3 . Through holes 13 23 are furnished extending from the top to the bottom of the jaw through the channel 12,22 these are for each housing a countersunk bolt 4 which also passes through the slots 32 of the slidable clamp members 3,3 for locating the same. The slidable clamp members 3,3 are swivellable in the semi circular channels 12,22 to an optimum angular orientation. Further, if more than two slidable clamp members 3 are installed between the positioning jaw 1 and the slidable jaw 2, a curved portion 11,21 will be furnished between every two slidable clamp members 3. Alternatively, as shown in Figure 1B, on both the top and the bottom of each of the slidable clamp members 3,3 , a peg 34,34 may be provided. At the top and the bottom of the semi circular channels 12, 22 in the positioning jaw 1 and the slidable jaw 2, arcuate through slots 15,25 may be furnished so as to accommodate the pegs 34,34 on the slidable clamp members 3,3 and to allow the slidable clamp members 3, 3 to be freely movable in the semi circular channels 12,22 to an optimum position. If an irregularly shaped work piece is put in either of the above described vice mouths and the positioning and the slidable jaws 1,2 are moved together so that the clamp membes 3,3 grip the work piece, the clamp members will automatically adjust their angular orientation by using the semi circular channels 12,22 as guides, so as to grip the work piece with their clamping surfaces 31,31 in the optimum stable firm position. Figure 2 shows a vice according to this invention clamping a work piece a having a triangular cross section. On the left hand side of the vice mouth, the two slidable clamp members 3 on the positioning jaw 1 will automatically adjust to such an oblique angle as to have the clamping surfaces 31 firmly contacting two sides of the work piece, while the other clamping surface 31 of the two slidable clamp members 3 on the right hand side of the vice will firmly contact the other side of the work piece a . After slightly further tightening the vice mouth, the work piece a will be tightly clamped. As shown in Figure 3, the vice may be used for clamping a work piece having a skewed quadrilateral cross section. The slidable clamp members 3, 3 of the positioning jaw 1 and the didable jaw 2 will automatically adjust to fit the shape of the work piece b . The firmness and stability is much better than in the conventional two jawed vice, which can only clamp a work piece at two predetermined angles. Figure 4 shows an embodiment of the vice in which the clamping surface 31 of the slidable clamp member 3 is furnished with V shaped grooves 33 for firmly holding a round work piece c . The number of slidable clamp members 3 to be installed on the positioning jaw 1 and the slidable jaw 2 may be varied depending upon the requirements.The number of slidable clamp members 3 to be installed on each of the two jaws need not be the same Only one jaw need be employed with a slidable clamp member 3.The number of through holes 13,23 and the semi circular channels 12,22 may also be varied depending upon the requirements. Figure 5 shows a second embodiment of the vice according to this invention, in which the slidable clamp members 3,3 and the semi circular channels 12, 22 engage each other about an oblique contacting surface for a better engagement. Figure 6 shows a third embodiment of vice of this invention, in which the positioning jaw 1 may be fixed by a through bolt 6 as shown in Figure 6A , or a central, upstanding post 66 as shown in Figure 6B . The rear face d the positioning jaw 1 is provided with an arcuate projection which has a dovetail shaped cross section 16 to be coupled to a complementary dovetail shaped channel 51 in a portion of the base 5 as shown in Figure 6C or the rear face d the jaw is provided with a straight projection, having a dovetail shaped cross section 17 to be coupled to a complementary straight channel 52 as shown inFigure 6D . The positioning jaw 1 may be freely angularly moved by pivoting on the through bolt 6 or the central post 66, and or the arcuate dovetail shaped channel 51 or the elongate dovetail channel 52. Upon a work piece with an irregular shape being put in the vice mouth, the slidable jaw 2 is moved forwards to hold. the work piece. Simultaneously, not only can the slidable clamp members 3,3 be automatically adjusted to.fit right angles, but the positioning jaw 1 can also be suitably adjusted to adapt the slidable clamp members 3,3 for the optimum clamping to a workpiece.Further, as shown in Figures 6C and 6D, an arcuate channel 161 or an elongate straight channel 171 may respectively accommodate a complementary arcuate projection with a dove tail shaped cross section 16 or a nomplementsmy straight projection, which has a dovetail shaped cross section 17 of the positioning jaw 1. On the rear face Cf the base 5, a locking srew 53 or mechanical catch means may be furnished to go through the channel 161 or the channel 171 for locking the positioning jaw 1 in position so that it cannot slide laterally. As shown in Figure 6C, in the third embodiment the clamp membes 3 may have an arcuate projection which has a dovetail shaped cross section 34 for coupling to a complementary arcuate channel, which has a dovetail shaped cross section 14 in the positioning jaw 1 so that the slidable clamp membrs 3 are movable in the jaw 1. Furthermore, the slidable clamp members 3 and the positioning jaw 1 may be furnished with rollers 19 or balls between the arcuate projections which have a dovetail shaped cross section 34,16 and the arcuate channel which has a dovetail shaped cross section 51,14 for smooth movement. Figures 8A and 8B show a fourth embodiment of vice according to this invention. Perpendicular to the jaws on one or both sides of the vice mouth or an the base surface, an auxiliary stop 10 is furnished, and the surface of this which contacts the work piece is provided with gripping ridges or with one or more slidable clamp membes 3. The auxiliary stop 10 may be securely attached to the positioning jaw 1, the slidable jaw 2 or the base 5, or it may be made integral with any of these. The auxiliary stop 10 may be movable to and fro by hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical 101 or manual means. Upon the two jaws 1,2 being moved together for clamping a work piece, the auxiliary stop 10 may serve as an auxiliary supporting surface to make the clamping operation even more stable and firm, especially in clamping a work piece which has parallel or oblique surfaces. In addition to the aforesaid embodiments of vice that have the two jaws moving in the same direction, in a fifth embodiment the clamp according to this invention may have four jaws arranged in cruciform manner with two pairs of mutually confronting, spaced apart jaws. Each jaw as shown in Figure 9 can move back and forth. One or more jaws may be furnished with one or more slidable clamp membes 3 so as to clamp work pieces. The clamping faces of the slidable clamp membes 3,3 of the jaws 1,2 may have any suitable shape such as in the sixth embodiment shown in Figure 10 , in which the jaws 1,2 have surfaces 19,20 which are semi circular in cross section and the clamp members are vertically disposed so as to be angularly movable in a vertical rather than a horizontal plane. Further the jaws 1,2 having the through bolt 6, the upstanding post 66 or the arcuate projection,which has a dovetailshaped cross section 16 on the back may be coupled with the arcuate channel, which has a dovetail shaped cross section, 51 on the base 5 so as to give a three dimensional clamping function by means of the jaws 1,2 and the vertical slidable clamp membes 3 being arranged at 900, or other given angle s , to the jaws. A seventh embodiment of the vice of the present invention is shown in both Figure llA top view andFigure ll , front sectional view . The mouth of the vice includes four sets of jaws again arranged in a cruciform manner. All of the jaws are movable back and forth. Under the bottom of each of the jaws 1 a disk 18 is furnished, as shown in Figure 11B, and is housed in an annular recess 53 in the base 5 and retained by engagement in undercut slots. The base 5 of each jaw is driven by a guide screw 54 back and forth along the guide rail 55. On the clamping surface of the jaws 1, one or more slidable clamp membes 3 is furnished. Upon the bases 5 being moved closely to one another for clamping a work piece, the jaws 1 and the slidable clamp membes 3 will angularly mare automatically to an optimum respective angular orientation so as to tightly clamp the work piece. The guide screws 54 couple with a positioning block 56 at one end and its other end is connected to a handle 57, by which the screw is adjust ablei In Figure 12A is shown an eighth embodiment of the present invention, in which a positioning jaw 1, at one side is pivotable on a through bolt 6. Two slidable clamp jaws 2 are movable back and forth by a guide screw 54. Both the positioning jaw 1 and the slidable clamp jaws 2 , 2 each have on their clamping surfaces a slidable clamp member 3, 3 .Both the types of jaws 1, 2 are furnished respectively with a projecting piece, having a circular cross section, 111 that are to be oup1ed with complementary channels 311, 311 on the rear. face Cf the slidable clamp members 3, 31When the slidable clamp membes 3 3 clamp the work piece, the clamp membes 3,3 may be angularly moved on the circular pieces 111 of the jaws 1, 2. At the bottom of each of the clamp membes 3, 3 , there are arcuate channels 312, 312 coupled to studs 113 attached to bottom plates 112, 212. On the top of the clamp membes 3, 3 , two covers 114, 214 are respectively locked to the jaws l and 2 so as to prevent the clamp members 3, 3 from moving upwards to separate from the jaws. Referring now to Figure 12B, the jaws 1, 2 are furnished respectively with circular channels 115, 215 to be coupled with the complememtary pieces of circular cross section 313, 313 on the rear face of the slidable clamping membes 3, 3 . The use is the same as that of the inverse arrangement shown in Figure 12A. Referring now to Figure 13, in a ninth embodiment, the vice may be fixed and secured by means of the tension applied by guide screws 54 so as to prevent the jaws from loosening upon clamping a work piece and as a result of vibrations in use. In Figure 12A and Figure 13A, both embodiments are furnished respectively with a channelled guide base having two side portions 58 and 59. A guide screw 54 goes through the guide base to control the jaw 1. An obliquely threaded hole 589 is furnished on the top and between the side portions of the channelled guide base, for housing a screw 598 having a handle. When the screw 598 is loose, the guide base is in its normal position. Upon the jaws 1, 2 clamping a work piece the screw 598 is driven into the obliquely threaded hole 589 to separate the two sides of the guide base 58, 59 and to apply tension to the guide screw 54, in order to prevent the jaw 1 from loosening. The screw may be conical 598 , and the obliquely threaded hole 589 may be a straight sided hole 589 .When the conical screw 598 is driven into the st aight sided hole 589 , the two side portions of the guide base 58, 59 may also be opened to apply a tension to the guide screw 54. Referring now to Figure 13B, a movable screw 581 may be employed having a handle going through one side 58 of the guide base, and being stopped by the other side 59 of the guide base. When the movable screw bolt 581 is driven forwards to push the other side 59 of the guide base, the guide base will be given a minor deformation so as to provide a locking function to the guide screw 54. Referring to Figure 13C, a through hole 583 is furnished in one side 58 of the guide base so as to allow the movable screw bolt 582 to go through. In the other side 59 of the guide base, a threaded hole 593 coupled with the end of the movable screw 582 is furnished. Upon the movable screw bolt 582 being driven back and forth, the handle of the screw bolt 582 will m√Öa one side 58 of the guide base become tight or loose so as to cause the guide screw 54 to become respectively tight or loose. The slidable clamp member may not only be used as a vice in the various kinds of well known table vices e.g. the mechanical working bench vice, the adjustable base angle vice, and the work piece clamping block but also it may be used in a manual gripping. member 7 such as that shown in Figure 14, the tenth embodiment, in which a slidable clamp member 3 is furnished on both jaws 71 to form a clamping surface. Figure 15 shows an eleventh embodiment of this invention, in which jaws 81 furnished with the slidable clamp members 3 are attached to a lathe chuck 8. Figure 16 shows a twelfth embodiment of this invention, in which a robot hand 9 is furnished with the slidable clamp members 3 on the two jaws 91 for firmly clamping an element having an irregular shape.It is therefore seen from the above embodiments that the clamp members according to this invention may be used in any clamping device to tightly clamp an object.
