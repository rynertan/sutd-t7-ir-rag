# A method of making an article of footwear.

## Abstract
The article of footwear is made by partially forming the article so as to comprise at least an upper 11 lasted to a first insole 12 , arranging the partially formed article to fully expose the upper or inner surface of the first insole, preferably by turning the partially formed article inside out, and moulding a shock absorbing or resilient second insole 15 of elastomeric, preferably visco elastic, material onto the exposed surface of the first insole. An outsole 13 is applied to the article at some stage, preferably before the second insole.
