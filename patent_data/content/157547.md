## Description
This invention relates to a badminton shuttlecock. Conventional shuttlecocks comprise a base in which is fixed the flights which may be individual natural feathers or a single integral flight formed from a plastics material. It is unusual for provision to be made for adjusting the configuration of the flight feathers of the shuttlecock thereby to alter its flight characteristics. Moreover, no provision has been made in conventional shuttlecocks to allow the individual feathers of the flights to be replaced in the event of damage during use, or to be originally fabricated from materials with lower strength to weight ratios than natural feathers without loss of performance. US A 2 116 304 discloses a shuttlecock in which the angular disposition of the flight feathers can be altered thereby changing the air resistance drag coefficient of the shuttlecock and consequently its flight speed. In this construction, the base of the shuttlecock is flexible, being made from an elastomeric material, and a ring is movable up and down the outer surface of the base to apply or relax a constricting force on the stems of the flight feathers to change their radial extent. This is not a particularly satisfactory construction either in terms of the reliability of the setting chosen, the accuracy of the setting nor the aerodynamics of the arrangement. The present invention seeks to improve the features giving speed adjustability so that the base of the shuttlecock itself can be employed to effect the speed adjustment which is required. One aspect of the invention provides a badminton shuttlecock characterised by having a base and a means for altering the configuration of its flights thereby to alter the speed of the shuttlecock characterised in that said means comprises a connector within the base which cooperates with both the base and the flights. Adjustable speed reduces the need for tight quality control in manufacture and inefficient manufacture and distribution of various weights of shuttle is eliminated. The user need not discard shuttles of incorrect speed, as at present. Another aspect of the invention provides a badminton shuttlecock comprising a base and a plurality of flight feathers diverging upwardly from said base in an annular array, characterised by a connector element secured to said base and a bracing ring located intermediate the ends of the flight feathers above said base and with which each of the stems of the flight feathers cooperates, said connecting element and said bracing ring being joined together by a connecting structure. Shuttlecocks embodying the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring first to FIGURES 1 and 2 of the drawings, a badminton shuttlecock 10 has a base 12 which includes a lower solid portion 14 and an upper hollow portion 16. The base may be formed from cork or a plastics material or a combination thereof and has an outer fabric or leather type cover 18. The upper hollow portion of the base comprises an annular locating boss 20 which is secured to the lower solid portion by a downwardly extending anchoring flange 22. The upper and lower parts may be formed integrally or secured together by any suitable means. The locating boss is formed with an internal screw thread 24 to which a complimentary connector ring 26 is adjustably attached by means of an external screw thread 28. The connector ring forms part of a connector element 30 which may be formed from a plastics material and which comprises an upper bracing ring 32 which is integrally connected to the connector ring by means of a plurality of struts 34. The connector element 30 receives the flights of the shuttlecock and to this end, the upper bracing ring 32 is formed with a multiplicity of equidistant spaced apertures 36 through each of which the shaft 38 of a flight feather extends and is received in a registering aperture 40 formed in the connector ring 26. As is usual, the flight feathers are arranged in an upwardly divergent annular array. Thus, the bracing ring is of increased diameter relative to the connector ring. The struts 34 are disposed radially inwardly of the flights. Thus the shuttlecock comprises a base adjustable with respect to and detachable from a flight assembly which comprises the connector element 30 which holds an annular array 42 of flight feathers. When the base is rotated relative to the connector ring 26 such that it moves upwardly of the connector element, a shoulder portion 44 of the locating boss applies a radially inwardly directed force to the stems of the flight feathers at their lowermost ends i.e at locations adjacent the connector ring. This causes the feathers to pivot about the bracing ring so that the diameter of the flight assembly, as measured across the tips of the feathers dimension D is increased, thereby decreasing the flight speed of the shuttlecock. Since the stems of the flight feathers are outwardly flared it will be appreciated that the more the base is moved upwardly of the connector element the greater is the radial inward force applied by the locating boss to the stems of the flight features causing a proportionately larger increase in diameter D . Conversely, in order to reduce diameter D thereby to increase the flight speed of the shuttlecock, the base is rotated in the opposite direction so that it moves downwardly of the connector element thus reducing the radially inwardly directed force on the stems of the flight feathers. The apertures 36 in the upper bracing ring 32 are such as to allow for the pivotal movement of the stems. In FIGURES 1 and 2 the base is shown in its lowermost position with respect to the connector element i.e the shuttlecock is set in a high speed mode. In the construction described above, each of the flight feathers is separately detachable from the connector element. Such a construction in which the feathers are not permanently fixed allows for easy replacement of individual feathers damaged during use, thereby extending the life of the shuttle. However, the flights could be permanently fixed in the connector ring. In a modified construction illustrated in FIGURE 3, each of the flight feathers may be of reduced length and is received in a different connector element. In this embodiment, like parts are designated like reference numerals with the addition of suffix a . The connector element 30a comprises an upwardly divergent annular array of separate or integral elongate sleeves 46 each of which receives the stem of a shortened flight feather. In other respects, this modified construction is similar to that described with reference to FIGURE 1 and 2. However, it will be appreciated that the locating boss acts on the sleeves of the connector element to alter the diameter of the flights. In this regard, a radially inwardly directed force applied by the boss at the lower ends of the sleeves tends to distort the bracing ring 32a thus moving the feathered ends of the flight feathers radially outwardly. In such a construction the strength of the bracing ring allows the use of comparatively low strength to weight ratio materials for construction of all or part of the individual flight feathers . It is envisaged that the provision of partly or wholly synthetic individual flight features or of detachable and replaceable flight feathers may be independent of the requirement for speed adjustability. Thus, in the embodiments described with reference to FIGURES 3 and 4, the connector element 30a, may be formed integrally with the base of the shuttlecock. Thus, the base is not adjustable with respect to the flight assembly but the flight feathers nevertheless are separately detachable from the connector element. It is also envisaged that the speed of the shuttlecock may be altered by varying its weight rather than altering the configuration of its flights. For example, in a construction where a detachable but not necessarily adjustable base is provided selectable weights could be removably fitted therein or otherwise attached to the shuttlecock in such location that its balance is not upset. The flight feathers of the various embodiments of shuttlecocks referred to herein may be natural normally selected goose feathers or formed from a synthetic material or of composite form being partly synthetic and partly natural, and the term flights or feathers as used in this specification is to be interpreted accordingly.
