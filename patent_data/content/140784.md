## Description
PROSTAGLANDIN ANTAGONISTS This invention relates to prostaglandin antagonists useful in treating a variety of conditions in mammals especially humans , such as allergic asthma where excessive contractile activity of prostaglandins and prostaglandin biosynthetic intermediates occur. These prostaglandin antagonists are also useful in reducing the formation of thrombi. Thus, the compounds of this invention are useful in the treatment and or prevention of thromboembolic diseases, particularly arterial thrombosis which has been reported to be initiated by injury of the blood vessel wall J. F. Mustard, et al., Drugs, 9, 19 76 1975 J. C. McGiff, Adv.Intern. Med., 25, 199 216 1980 . These prostaglandin antagonists are a novel group of 6H dibenz b,eJ l,4 oxathiepins having the following structural formulae EMI2.1 wherein Z is thio, sulfinyl, or sulfonyl R1 and R2 are each independently hydrogen, halogen, amino, C1 to C4 alkyl, C1 to C4 alkylthio, C1 to C4 alkoxy, thiol, C1 to C4 alkylsulfinyl, C1 to C4 alkylsulfonyl, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethylthio, cyano, nitro, C1 to C4 alkyl or dialkylamino, aralkyl for example, benzyl or phenethyl , or hydroxyalkyl for example, CH3CHOH , or R1 and R2 are joined together to form a polymethylene chain of 3 or 4 carbon atoms with or without a hydroxy or keto functionality X is oxo, N R3, wherein R3 is hydrogen, C1 to C4 alkyl, aryl, hydroxy, C1 to C4 alkoxy, C1 to C4 acyloxy, amino, C1 to C4 alkylamino or dialkylamino wherein each alkyl group has 1 to 4 carbons or a group of the formula EMI3.1 wherein each Y is independently 0 or S or NR6 wherein R6 is H, C1 to C4 alkyl, lower alkanoyl, benzoyl, trifluoroacetyl or CN and R4 and R5 are each independently hydrogen or C1 to C4 alkyl and the broken line between R4 and R5 represents an optional bond when R4 and R5 are not hydrogen and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. As used herein, the term halogen or halo includes chlorine, bromine, iodine, and fluorine.Unless otherwise specifically stated, the terms loweralkyl and loweralkoxy include straight and branched chain alkyl and alkoxy groups having 1 to 5 carbon atoms in the alkyl or alkoxy moiety such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, methoxy, ethoxy, n propoxy, and isobutoxy.The term loweralkanoyl includes straight or branched chain alkanoyl groups having 1 to 5 carbon atoms in the alkanoyl moiety such as, for example, formyl, acetyl, propanoyl, isobutyryl and pivaloyl. The term aralkyl includes straight or branched chain alkyl radicals of 1 to 4 carbon atoms having one of the hydrogens replaced by an aryl group. The term aryl includes phenyl and substituted phenyl groups, including halophenyl such as chloro, bromo, iodo, and fluorophenyl, nitrophenyl, aminophenyl, hydroxyphenyl, loweralkylphenyl, and the like. These dibenzoxathiepin derivatives antagonize the actions of contractile prostaglandins, such as PGF2a, PGH2, and TXA2. The use of agents which act as prostaglandin antagonists offer new approaches to therapy in a number of disease states. For example, certain prostaglandins, such as PGF2a, PGG, and PGH2, are potent contractants of bronchial muscle. Indeed human asthmatics have been shown to be especially sensitive t6 the bronchial constricting action of PGF2a. In addition to the involvement of contractile prostaglandins in chronic obstructive lung disease or asthma , prostaglandins are known to play a role in other allergic conditions, as well as inflammation, diarrhea, hypertension, angina, platelet aggregation, cerebral spasm, premature abortion, and dismenorrhea. In addition to the prostaglandin antagonist actions, the dibenzoxathiepins of this invention are antagonists of slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis SRS A . This contractile substance is released in the lung tissue in allergic asthma, and antagonism of its actions contributes to alleviation of this disease. The dibenzoxathiepins of Formula I of this invention are prepared according to the following general reaction scheme EMI4.1 where R1, R2 and Z are as defined above. FormulaIA is prepared similarly using the appropriate starting material. As shown in the above reaction scheme, an appropriately substituted 2 hydroxymethyl dibenzoxathiepin is oxidized to the correspondingly substituted dibenzoxathiepin 2 carboxaldehyde by treatment with an oxidizing agent, such as pyridinium chlorochromate, tert butyl chromate, potassium dichromate, lead tetracetate or 2,3 dichloro 5,6dicyanoquinone DDQ . Each reagent is effective for bringing about the desired oxidation to a carboxaldehyde substituent but pyridinium chlorochromate is preferred for the oxidation of the hydroxymethyl group to a carboxaldehyde group. The oxidation is conducted in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions and may be either volatile or non volatile. Ethyl ether or other loweralkyl ethers are satisfactory and tetrahydrofuran is a commonly preferred solvent.A more preferred type of solvent is a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, 1,2 dichloroethane, chloroform, etc. The chosen oxidation reagent is employed in a slight excess over the stoichiometric amount needed in order to insure completeness of reaction. The reaction is maintained at a temperature between 0 and 1000C or the reflux temperature of the solvent.Most alcohols are oxidized relatively completely at room temperature 250C and in a relatively short time approximately 1 hour , and therefore the oxidation is usually conducted by stirring the alcohol for a period of from 30 minutes to 12 hours at a temperature of from 100 to 400C. Following the completion of the reaction, the product is isolated by the addition of water and extraction into ether.The ether extract is evaporated to obtain the residual product which is purified by chromatography or recrystallized from an appropriate solvent. Alternatively, an aldehyde derivative can be obtained by treatment of an appropriate nitrile with a nickel catalyst such as a 1 1 alloy of nickel and aluminium, in an acidic medium such as formic acid.It is also possible to transform an alkanoyl ester for example a methyl or ethyl ester, into the corresponding aldehyde through the action of a dialkyl aluminium hydride reagent such as di isobutyl aluminium hydride, using as solvent a dialkyl or cyclic ether, such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran. The dibenzoxathiepin 2 carboxaldehyde lloxide or derivatives thereof are alternatively prepared by oxidation of the corresponding dibenzoxathiepin 2 carboxaldehyde with organic peroxides such as peroxy acids like m chloroperbenzoic acid or hydrogen peroxide in acetic acid. The oxidation can be carried further, if an additional equivalent of oxidizing agent is employed, to produce the corresponding dibenzoxathiepin ll,ll dioxides. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that variations in these preparative schemes will allow one to prepare a variety of substituted dibenzoxathiepin 2 carboxaldehydes. The compounds of Formulae I and Ia wherein X is other than oxygen may be prepared by methods well known to one skilled in the art. Thus, oximes orSchiff bases are prepared by treating I or Ia X oxo with hydroxylamine or a primary amine, respectively acetals are prepared by treating the aldehydes with a lower alkanol in the presence of a mineral acid or with a reagent such as 2 methoxy1,3 dioxolane in the presence of a mineral acid. Some of the compounds of Formulae I and IA are capable of existing as optical isomers which may be resolved by known procedures into their enantiomers. Each of the enantiomorphic isomers may exhibit variation in biological potency and it is understood that the present invention includes the racemic mixture as well as the individual resolved optical isomers. Preferred embodiments of this invention are the compounds of Formula IA wherein Z is sulfinyl or sulfonyl, R2 is hydrogen and R1 is at position 8 or 9 and is fluoro, chloro, bromo, amino or hydrogen, and the compounds of Formula I wherein Z is sulfinyl or sulfonyl, R2 is hydrogen and R1 is at position 2 or 3 and is fluoro, chloro, bromo, amino or hydrogen. More preferred embodiments of this invention are the compounds of Formula IA wherein Z is sulfinyl or sulfonyl, R2 is hydrogen, R1 is at position 8 or 9 and is fluoro, chloro, bromo, amino, or hydrogen and X is oxo, and the compounds of Formula I whereinZ is sulfinyl or sulfonyl, R2 is hydrogen, R1 is at position 2 or 3 and is fluoro, chloro, bromo, amino or hydrogen, and X is oxo. Particularly preferred embodiments of this invention are the compounds of Formula IA wherein Z is sulfonyl, Rê is hydrogen and RÚ is at position 8 or 9 and is fluoro, chloro, bromo, amino, or hydrogen, and X is oxo, and the compounds of FormulaI wherein Z is sulfonyl, Rê is hydrogen, RÚ is at position 2 or 3 and is fluoro, chloro, bromo, amino or hydrogen, and X is oxo. The starting materials, the alcohols, are described in copending application Case 16789IA, U.S.Serial No. 520,053, filed August 5, 1983, andEuropean Patent Application 83305753.2, PublicationNo. 0 105 692, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In addition, preparative examples of some representative starting materials are found herein. Generally, to prepare the starting materials of Formula IA, an appropriately substituted o iodobenzoic acid is reacted with o methoxythiophenol in the presence of copper powder and aqueous potassium hydroxide in order to obtain the corresponding 2 o methoxyphenylthio benzoic acid.The reaction is carried out at reflux and usually requires 2 to 5 hours for completion. Upon recovery, the acid product may be converted into the corresponding lower alkanol ester by refluxing with a lower alkanol in the presence of a strong acid such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, trifluoroacetic acid and the like.The ester product then is treated with dichloromethyl methylether in the presence of titanium tetrachloride to form the corresponding 3 o carboloweralkoxyphenylthio 4 methoxybenzaldehyde which then is demethylated with hydrogen bromide in glacial acetic acid to form the corresponding 3 o carboxyphenylthio 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde. The aldehyde so produced then is treated with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of sodium formate and formic acid to form the corresponding 3 o carboxyphenylthio 4 hydroxybenzonitrile which is treated with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC to form the corresponding 2 cyano 6H 6 oxo dibenz b,e 1,4 oxathiepin.The 2 cyano oxathiepin product then is treated with an alkali metal borohydride to form the corresponding 3 o hydroxymethylphenylthio 4 hydroxybenzonitrile which is reacted with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to form the desired 2 cyano 6H dibenz b,e l,4ioxathiepin, which is then processed, via a combination of oxidation and hydrolysis, to the carboxylic acid derivative having the desired oxidation state on the sulfur. Alternatively, an appropriately substituted o mercaptobenzyl alcohol is reacted with 3 iodo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid in the presence of copper powder and aqueous potassium hydroxide in order to obtain the corresponding 3 o hydroxymethyl phenylthio 4 hydroxybenzoic acid. The reaction is carried out at reflux and generally requires 6 to 24 hours for completion. After isolation the acid product may be converted into the corresponding lower alkanol ester by refluxing with a lower alkanol in the presence of a strong acid such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, trifluoroacetic acid and the like.The ester product then is cyclized, for example through the use of diethyl azo dicarboxylate in the presence of triphenyl phosphine, in an inert solvent, preferably an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, or through the use of a dehydrating agent such as dicyclohexyl carbodiimide, to afford the corresponding appropriately substituted 6H dibenz b,e l,4 oxathiepin 2 carboxylate, which is then hydrolyzed through the action of an aqueous solution of a strong alkali such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, followed by acidification to yield the corresponding carboxylic acid derivative. To prepare Formula I derivatives, an appropriately substituted o amino thiophenol is reacted with 2 chloro 4 nitrobenzoic acid in the presence of cuprous oxide in quinoline, to produce the corresponding 2 o aminophenylthio 4 nitrobenzoic acid. The amine function is then diazotized through the action of sodium nitrite in dilute aqueous sulfuric acid, and the diazonium salt transformed into the corresponding phenol by heating in 50 aqueous sulfuric acid. The precipitated product is collected, and transformed, preferably by the action of borane in tetrahydrofuran, into the corresponding 2 o hydroxyphenylthio 4 nitrobenzyl alcohol. Compounds of this type are cyclized through the use of an appropriate dehydrating agent, such as dicyclohexyl carbodiimide, to the corresponding 9 nitro 6H dibenz b,e l,4 oxathiepin. The nitro function is transformed into an amine by one of several reducing agents, the reagent of choice being stannous chloride in a mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and tetrahydrofuran. The amino compound thus obtained is diazotized by treatment with sodium nitrite in aqueous hydrochloric acid, then transformed into the corresponding nitrile on addition of the diazonium salt to a mixture of cuprous cyanide and potassium cyanide in aqueous medium. The 9 cyano compounds thus obtained are then processed, via a combination of oxidation and hydrolysis, to the carboxylic acids having the desired oxidation state on the sulfur. The carboxylic acid derivative is then reduced to the corresponding 2 hydroxymethyl or 9 hydroxymethyl derivative by treatment with an alkali metal aluminum hydride such as lithium aluminum hydride, diborane, alkali metal borohydride, or alkali metal deuteride. The oxathiepins of Formulae I and IA are useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of human or warm blooded animal disease conditions where excessive undesirable contractile activity of prostaglandins, such as PGF2a, or prostaglandin biosynthetic intermediates contribute. In particular, they are of value in the treatment and control of allergic conditions such as asthma. It will be understood that in this paragraph and in the discussion of methods of treatment which follows, references to the compounds of Formulae I and IA are also meant to include the corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose of compounds of Formulae I and IA will, of course, vary with the nature and the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound of Formulae I and IA and its route of administration. In general, the dose range lies within the range of 0.2 mg to 100 mg per kg body weight per day.
