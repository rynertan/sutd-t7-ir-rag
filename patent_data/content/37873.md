# Process and apparatus for forming shell molds.

## Abstract
A pattern holder 12 and a sand tank 14 are rota tably mounted on a frame 16 so that the pattern holder can be inverted over and sealably mounted atop the sand tank. A vented pattern 26 is secured to the pattern hol der and forms a first chamber 38 between one side of a pattern 26 and the interior of the pattern holder. A se cond chamber 90 is formed between the other side of the pattern and the interior of the sand tank when the pat tern holder adjoins the sand tank. O ring seals 32 and 80 isolate the chambers from the atmosphere so that a partial vacuum can be formed therein. A mixture 84 of sand and a gas curable binder is provided in the sand tank so that the mixture will fall onto the pattern 26 upon in verting the sand tank over the pattern holder. A flexible line 42 is provided for controllably introducing a gas ca talyst into the first chamber 38 in order to cure a portion of the sand binder mixture to form a shell mold 94 of a predetermined thickness on a pattern face 36 of the pat tern. Flexible lines 41 and 43 are provided for evacuat ing and purging the first chamber 38 at different stages during the process.
