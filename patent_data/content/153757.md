# DIGITAL TELEVISION SIGNAL PROCESSING CIRCUIT

## Abstract
An analog video signal of a PAL system is converted into a digital video signal by an A D converter 12 . The digital video signal is supplied to a delay device 13 so as to be subjected to hue correction and Y C separation. The delay device 13 generates a plurality of digital video signals with different delay times. The digital video signals S1 t and S2 t obtained from the delay device are supplied to a first subtracter 15 , and the digital video signals S3 t and S4 t are supplied to a second subtracter 16 . The outputs from the first and second subtracters are supplied to a third subtracter 19 , and the output from the third subtracter 19 is multiplied with a coefficient, thereby obtaining a first chrominance signal U t . The outputs from the first and second subtracters 15, 16 are supplied to a first adder 17 , and the output from the first adder 17 is multiplied with a coefficient, thereby obtaining a second chrominance signal V t .
