## Description
This invention relates to 1 3 or 4 benzoylphenyl lower alkyl piperidines and analogs thereof, useful as anti asthmatic, anti allergic, anti cholinergic, bronchodilator and anti inflammatory agents and to the preparation thereof. British Patent 1,508,391 discloses certain 1 3benzoylphenyl lower alkyl piperidines, which are either unsubstituted in the piperidine ring or which are substituted by various hydrocarbon groups and which are disclosed as being useful as anti inflammatory agents. French Patent 1,549,342, de livrd November 4, 1968, discloses certain 4 benzoylphenylmethyl morpholines useful as anti inflammatory and anti diabetic agents. However, compounds of the 1 3 or 4 benzoylphenyl lower alkyl piperidine class substituted in the piperidine ring by basic, i.e. amine, function are unknown. Moreover, the use of compounds of this general class as anti asthmatics, anti allergics, anti cholinergics and bronchodilators likewise appears to be novel. More specifically this invention relates to 1 2 3 or 4 benzoylphenyl lower alkyl CH2 N B substituted piperidines, and analogs thereof which are useful as anti asthmatic, anti allergic, anti cholinergic, bronchodilator and anti inflammatory agents, having the formula EMI2.1 where R is hydrogen or lower alkyl m is 0 or 1 n is 0 or 1 N B is l piperidinyl, 4 morpholinyl, amino, di loweralkylamino, lower alkanoylamino, N lower alkyl N lower alkanoylamino, cycloalkanecarbonylamino or benzoylamino, or benzoylamino substituted in the phenyl ring by loweralkyl, halogen i.e. bromine, chlorine or fluorine or lower alkoxy the group C X is C O or CHOH and where thePhenyl C X moiety of the Phenyl C x Phenyl CHRCH2 group is attached either to the 3 or the 4 position of the phenyl ring, when m is 1 but only to the 3 position when m is 0 and the CH2 nN B group is attached either to the 2 , 3 or 4 position of the piperidine ring with the further proviso that when m is 0, n is 1, R is loweralkyl, and N B is l piperidinyl, or 4 morpholinyl. The compounds of Formula I as defined above where m is 1 can be designated as Formula Ia and those where m is 0 can be designated as Formula Ib. As used herein the terms lower alkyl, lower alkoxy and lower alkanoyl means saturated, monovalent, aliphatic radicals, including branched chain radicals, of from one to six carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, hexyl, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, formyl, acetyl, propionyl, a methylpropionyl, hexanoyl and the like. As used herein the term cycloalkane means saturated cyclic hydrocarbon rings containing from three to seven ring carbon atoms. The term is thus embracive of such groups, for example, as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl. The compounds of Formula I where m is 1 and where C X represents C O can be prepared by a variety of methods. One method comprises reacting a 2 3 or 4 benzoylphenyl lower alkyl tosylate of Formula II with an appropriate CH2 nN B substituted piperidine ofFormula III in the presence of an acid acceptor according to the reaction EMI3.1 where R, n and N B have the meanings given above, and Ts represents the p toluenesulfonyl group. The reaction is preferably carried out by heating the reactants in an inert organic solvent, for example dimethylformamide DMF , acetonitrile or a lower alkanol. Suitable acidacceptors are alkali metal carbonates or bicarbonates and an excess of the substituted piperidine of Formula III. The tosylates of Formula II are in turn prepared according to a sequence of reactions generally described in U.S. Patent 4,216,326 which involves reduction, with an alkali metal borohydride, of a 3 or 4 bromophenyllower alkanealdehyde or a 3 or 4 bromophenyl lower alkane carboxylic acid to the corresponding 3 or 4 bromophenyllower alkanol reaction of the latter with dihydropyran in the absence of solvent and in the presence of a strong acid reaction of the resulting 3 or 4 bromophenyl loweralkyl tetrahydropyranyl ether with a lower alkyl lithium followed by reaction of the resulting 3 or 4 lithiophenyllower alkyl tetrahydropyranyl ether with benzonitrile and hydrolysis of the resulting 3 or 4 benzimidoylphenyl lower alkyl tetrahydropyranyl ether and reaction of the resulting 3 or 4 benzoylphenyl lower alkanol with a p toluenesulfonyl halide in the presence of pyridine. The compounds of Formula I where m is 1 and C X is C O can also be prepared by a sequence of reactions, also generaly described in U.S. Patent 4,216,326, involving reacting a 1 2 3 or 4 halophenyl lower alkyl .1 CH2ln N B subtituted piperidine of Formula IV below with a lower alkyl lithium in an aprotic organic solvent, for example diethyl ether reacting the resulting 1 2 3 or 4 lithiophenyl Lower alkyl CH, NEB substituted piperidine of Formula IVa with benzonitrile and hydrolyzing, with dilute mineral acid, the resulting 1 2 3 or 4 benzimidolyphenyl lower alkyl CH2 n N B substituted piperidine of Formula V. The method is illustrated by the following reaction sequence EMI4.1 where R, n and N B have the meanings given above, andHal represents halogen. The 1 2 3 or 4 halophenyl lower alkyl CH2 nN B substituted piperidines of Formula IV are in turn prepared according to the general method described inU.S. Patent 4,216,326 which comprises reacting a 2 3or 4 halophenyl lower alkanal with an appropriate CH2 n N B substituted piperidine converting the resulting 1 2 3 or 4 halophenyl vnyl CHZ N B substituted piperidine to the iminium salt by reaction of the former with mineral acid and reducing the iminium salt with an alkali metal borohydride or with hydrogen over a platinum oxide catalyst. A further method for preparing the compounds ofFormula I where m is 1 comprises reducing, with a suitable reducing agent, e.g., an alkali metal aluminum hydride or boronhydride a corresponding l a 3 or 4 benzoylphenyl lower alkanoyl CH2 nN B substituted piperidine having the Formula VI EMI5.1 or a ketal thereof followed by deketalization , where R, n and N B have the meanings given above. If it is desired to produce the compounds where C X is C O, the starting compounds of Formula VI are first converted to a ketal form, for example the ethylene glycol ketal. The ketals are prepared by reaction of the ketone with an alcohol, for example ethylene glycol, in the presence of an acid catalyst under dehydrating conditions, and the ketal group is then removed by acid hydrolysis after reduction of the amide function, that is, the compound of Formula I resulting from the reduction of the ketal of the compound of FormulaVI is deketalized. Otherwise, in the absence of such prior conversion to the ketal the compounds are reduced to the corresponding carbinols were C X is CHOH.The compounds of Formula VI can be prepared by reacting, in the presence of an acid acceptor and in an inert organic solvent, an a 3 or 4 benzoylphenyl lower alkanoyl halide having the formula EMI5.2 with a compound of the Formula III suitable organic solvents include benzene, toluene, methylene dichloride, ethylene dichloride and chloroform. The compounds of Formula I where m is 1 and N B is an amino group are prepared by hydrolysis, in the presence of an aqueous mineral acid, of a corrresponding compound where N B is lower alkanoylamino. The reaction is carried out by heating a mixture of the reactants under reflux, the course of the reaction being followed by thin layer chromatography. The coocounds thus prepared can then be reacylated with a lower alkanoyl halide, in order to prepare compounds where N B is a different lower alkanoylamino group, or with a cycloalkanecarbonyl halide or a benzoyl halide to prepare the compounds where N B is, respectively, cycloalkanecarbonylamino or benzoylamino. The compounds of Formula I where m is 0 are prepared by reacting a 3 benzoylphenyl CHR halide ofFormula VII EMI6.1 where R and Hal have the meanings given above, with an appropriate CH2 N B substituted piperidine of Formula III.The reaction is carried out in the presence of an acidacceptor, for example an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate, in an inert organic solvent, for example, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol or dimethylformamide DMF . If desired, an excess of the amine of Formula III can serve as the acid acceptor. If desired, one can reduce with a suitable reducing agent a compound of Formula I obtained whereC X is C O to prepare the corresponding compound whereC X is CHOH. As noted before in the above described procedure for preparing the compounds of Formula I by reduction of the amides of Formula VI with an alkali metal aluminum hydride or boron hydride when the ketone form of the compounds of Formula VI is used as the starting material, the reduction also results in reduction of the carbonyl group to the carbinol function C X is CHOH . Moreover, reduction with an alkali metal aluminum hydride or boron hydride will also effect reduction of other carbonyl containing functions, i.e. compounds where N B is lower alkanoylamino,N lower alkyl N lower alkanoylamino, cycloalkanecarbonylamino or benzoylamino, or substituted benzoylamino. Therefore, said reducing agent should not be used if one wishes to obtain the latter species.A preferred method for preparing all the compounds of Formula I where C X is CHOH, and N B has all the designated meanings comprises reduction of the corresponding compounds of Formula I where C X is 0 0 with an alkali metal borohydride in an organic solvent inert under the conditions of the reaction, for example loweralkanols, such as methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol, orDMF, preferably at a temperature of 5 to 100C. The novel compounds of the instant invention are the compounds of Formulas I, IV and VI and the acid addition salts thereof. The compounds of Formulas I, IV and VI in free base form are converted to the acid addition salt form by interaction of the base with an acid. In like manner, the free base can be regenerated from the acidaddition salt form in the conventional manner, that is by treating the salts with cold, weak aqueous bases, for example alkali metal carbonates and alkali metal bicarbonates. The bases thus regenerated can then be interacted with the same or a different acid to give back the same or different acid addition salt. Thus the novel bases and all of their acid addition salts are readily interconvertible. It will thus be appreciated that Formulas I,IV and VI not only represent the structural configuration of the bases of Formulas I, IV and VI but are also representative of the structural entities which are common to all of the compounds of Formulas I, IV and VI, whether in the form of the free bases or in the form of the acidaddition salts of the bases. It has been found that, by virtue of these common structural entities, the bases and the acid addition salts of the compounds of Formulas I and VI have inherent pharmacological activities of a type to be more fully described hereinbelow.These inherent pharmacological activities can be enjoyed in useful form for pharmaceutical purposes by employing the free bases themselves or the acid addition salts formed from pharmaceutically acceptable acids, that is acids whose anions are innocuous to the animal organism in effective doses of the salts so that beneficial properties inherent in the common structural entity represented by the free bases is not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the anions. In utilizing the pharmacological activities of the salts of the invention, it is preferred, of course, to use pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Although waterinsolubility, high toxicity, or lack of crystalline character may make some particular salt species unsuitable or less desirable for use as such in a given pharmaceutical application, the water insoluble or toxic salts can be converted to the corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable bases by decomposition of the salts with aqueous base as explained above, or alternatively they can be converted to any desired pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt by double decomposition reactions involving the anion, for example by ion exchange procedures. Moreover, apart from their usefulness in pharmaceutical applications, the salts are useful as characterizing or identifying derivatives of the free bases or in isolation or purification procedures. Like all of the acid addition salts, such characterizing or purification salt derivatives can, if desired, be used to regenerate the pharmaceutically acceptable free bases by reaction of the salts with aqueous base, or alternatively they can be converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt by, for example, ion exchange procedures. It will be appreciated from the foregoing that all of the acid addition salts of the new bases are useful and valuable compounds, regardless of considerations of solubility, toxicity, physical form and the like, and are accordingly within the purview of the instant invention. The novel feature of the compounds of the invention, then, resides in the concept of the bases and cationic forms of the new 1 3 or 4 benzoylphenyl lower alkyl CH2 N B substituted piperidines and the carbinol analogs of Formula I and the new l a 3 and 4 benzoylphenyl lower alkanoyl CH2 n N B substituted piperidines ofFormula VI and not in any particular acid moiety or acid anion associated with the salt forms of the compounds rather, the acid moieties or anions which can be associated with the salt forms are in themselves neither novel nor critical and therefore can be any acid anion or acid like substance capable of salt formation with the bases.In fact, in aqueous solutions the base form or water soluble acid addition salt form of the compounds of the invention both possess a common protonated cation or ammonium ion. Thus appropriate acid addition salts are those derived from such diverse acids as formic acid, acetic acid, isobutyric acid, alpha mercaptopropionic acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, succinamic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, lactic acid, benzoic acid, 4 methoxybenzoic acid, phthalic acid, anthranilic acid, l naphthalenecarboxylic acid, cinnamic acid, cyclohexane carboxylic acid, mandelic acid, tropic acid, crotonic acid, acetylenedicarboxylic acid, sorbic acid, 2 furancarboxylic acid, cholic acid, pyrenecarboxylic acid, 2 pyridinecarboxylic acid, 3 indoleacetic acid, quinic acid, sulfamic acid, methanesulfonic acid, isethionic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, benzenesulfinic acid, butylarsonic acid, diethylphosphonic acid, p aminophenylarsinic acid, phenyl stibnic acid, phenylphosphinous acid, methylphosphinic acid, phenylphosphinic acid, hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid, perchloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrocyanic acid, phosphotungstic acid, molybdic acid, phosphomolybdic acid, pyrophosphoric acid, arsenic acid, picric acid, picrolonic acid, barbituric acid, boron trifluoride, and the like. The acid addition salts are prepared by reacting the free base and the acid in an organic solvent and isolating the salt directly or by concentration of the solution. Due to the presence of at least one and as many as two asymmetric centers in the compounds of the invention, i.e. the carbon atom adjacent the phenyl ring to which the R and R groups are attached and the carbon atom of the piperidine ring to which the CH2 nN B group is attached, the compounds of the invention can exist in stereochemically isomeric forms which are all considered to be within the purview of the invention. If desired, the isolation or the production of a particular stereochemical form can be accomplished by application of general principles known in the art. In standard pharmacological test procedures, the compounds of Formula I, as well as certain species of compounds of Formula VI, primarily those wherein N B is l piperidinyl or 4 morpholinyl the Phenyl C O moiety of the Phenyl C O Phenyl CHR group is attached to the 3 position of the phenyl ring, and the CH2 n N B group is attached either to the 2 , 3 or 4 position of the piperidine ring R is lower alkyl and n is 1, have been found to possess useful anti inflammatory activity indicating utility of these compounds as anti inflammatory agents. Certain species of Formula I have also been found to possess bronchlodilator, anti asthmatic, anti allergic, anti cholinergic and analgesic activities, indicating utility of these species as bronchodilators, antiasthmatics, anti allergics, anti cholinergics and analgesics. Anti inflammatory activity was determined using 1 the inhibition of carrageenin induced foot edema test described by Winter et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. andMed. 111, 554 1962 as modified by Van Arman et al., J.Pharmacol. Exptl. Therap. 150, 328 1965 and 2 a modification of the inhibition of adjuvant induced arthritis test described by Pierson, J. Chronic Diseases 16, 863 1963 and Glenn et al., Am. J. Vet. Res. 26, 1180 1965 . The utility of the compounds of the invention as bronchodilators, anti asthmatics, anti allergics and anti cholinergics was established by their effectiveness in standard pharmacological test procedures, for example the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis test in rats described by Mielens et al., Int. Arch. Allergy, 47, 633 649 1974 a modified procedure of bronchoconstriction activity test in dogs described by Minatoya, J. Pharm. Exp. Therap., 206, 515 527 1978 the anaphylactic bronchoconstriction activity test in guinea pigs, a modified procedure ofMiller et al., Brit. J.Pharmacol, 58, 442P 443P 1976 the relaxation of guinea pig tracheal contractions by carbachol and by barium tests described by Spilker andMinatoya, Arch. int. de Pharmacodynamie et de Therap., 217, 201 217 1975 and a modification of the human basophils test described by Magro, Immunochem., 12, 389 1975 and by Conroy et al., Monogr. Allergy, 14, 307 309 1979 . Bronchodilator activity was also determined using a test procedure based on bronchoconstriction induced by histamine, acetylcholine and immune complex in guinea pigs which procedure is described as follows guinea pigs of either sex, weighing 250 350 g. each, were fasted overnight, then anesthetized with 1.5 of urethane kg. i.p. and the jugular vein and trachea were cannulated.The guinea pigs thus prepared were artificially respired with a rodent pump, and the intratracheal pressure was recorded continuously using a Statham transducer on aGrass polygraph. At five minute intervals, 5 pg. kg. of histamine phosphate determined as base was injected intravenously in order to ascertain that the maximum achievable bronchoconstrictor responsiveness i.e. the increase in intratracheal pressure in mm. Hg had been obtained, and the average of the last two increases in the intratracheal pressure was recorded. Acetylcholine was then injected intravenously at 15 pg. kg. five minutes after the last injection of histamine, and the increase in intratracheal pressure was again recorded.Two minutes following the injection of acetylcholine, 0.1 mg. kg. of propranolol was injected intravenously, and immune complexes rabbit anti bovine serum albumin BSA antibody BSA complexes dissolved in excess BSA were injected intravenously at 0.5 mg. of precipitating antibody kg. three minutes following the injection of propranolol, and the increase in intratracheal pressure was again recorded. Inhibition of bronchoconstriction was scored for each of the bronchoconstriction inducers i.e. histamine, acetylcholine and immune complex with respect to the average bronchoconstriction in negative control guinea pigs minimum of four guinea pigs in four days according to the following criteria Inhibition Score 81 100 4 61 80 3 41 60 2 21 40 1 0 20 0Test compounds scoring 3 or 4 against the three bronchoconstriction inducers were considered active those scoring 2 were considered marginally active and those scoring 0 or 1 were considered inactive. Aminophylline, which was used as a reference drug, gave scores ranging from 3 3 2 to 4 4 3 for bronchoconstriction induced by histamine, acetylcholine and immune complex, respectively. Generally speaking, the various bronchoconstrictor activity tests described above, i.e. the histamine induced bronchoconstriction activity test in dogs Minatoya and the histamine acetylcholine immune complex induced bronchoconstriction test in guinea pigs are used to define bronchodilator activity, while the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis test and the human basophils test can be used to define anti allergic activity. Moreover, activity by test species against one of the types of bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs induced by histamine, acetylcholine or immune complex can indicate utility, respectively, as anti histamines, anti cholinergics or prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors. Species useful as anti asthmatics ideally show both bronchodilator and anti allergic parameters of activity, but species useful for such purpose can have either parameter alone without the other. The test procedures used to determine the analgesic activity of the compounds have been described in detail in the prior art and are as follows The acetylcholine induced abdominal constriction test, which is a primary analgesic screening test designed to measure the ability of a test agent to suppress acetylcholine induced abdominal constriction in mice, described by Collier et al., Brit. J. Pharmacol. Chemotherap. 32, 295 1968 a modification of the anti bradykinin test, which is also a primary analgesic screening procedure, described byBerkowitz et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 177, 500 508 1971 , Blane et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 19, 367 373 1967 , Botha et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 6, 312 321 1969 and Deffenu et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 18, 135 1966 the phenyl p quinone inducedwrithing test, also a primary analgesic screening test, designed to measure the ability of a test agent to prevent phenyl p quinone induced writhing in mice, described by Pearl and Harris, J.Pharmacol. Exptl. Therap. 154, 319 323 1966 the rat tail flick radiant thermal heat analgesic agonist test decribed by D Amour and Smith, J. Pharmacol. Exptl. Therap.72, 74 1941 as modified by Bass and VanderBrook, J. Am.Pharm. Assoc. Sci.. Ed. 41, 569 1956 and the phenazocine antagonist test, which is designed to measure the ability of a test agent to antagonize the effect of phenazocine in the above indicated rat tail flick response test, described by Harris and Pierson, J. Pharmacol. Exptl. Therap. 143, 141 1964 . The actual determination of the numerical pharmacological data for a particular compound of the invention is readily obtained according to the above described standard test procedures by technicians versed in pharmacological test procedures without the need for any extensive experimentation. In clinical practice, the compounds of FormulasI and VI are normally administered orally or parenterally in a wide variety of dosage forms. Pharmaceutical compositions comprise the compounds of Formula I and a pharmaceutical carrier. Solid compositions for oral administration include compressed tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid compositions, at least one of the active compounds is admixed with at least one inert diluent such as starch, calcium carbonate, sucrose or lactose. These compositions can also contain additional substances other than inert diluents, for example lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, talc and the like. Liquid compositions for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water and liquid paraffin. Besides inert diluents, such compositions can also contain adjuvants, such as wetting and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, perfuming and preserving agents.According to this invention, the compounds for oral administration also include capsules of absorbable material such as gelatin containing the active component either with or without the addition of diluents or excipients. Preparations according to the invention for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous, aqueousorganic and organic solutions, suspensions and emulsions.Examples of organic solvents or suspending media are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. The compositions can also contain adjuvants such as stabilizing, preserving, wetting, emulsifying and dispersing agents. They can be sterilized, for example by filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, by incorporation of sterilizing agents in the compositions, by irradiation or by heating. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile solid compositions, which can be dissolved in sterile water or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. The percentages of active component in such compositions may be varied so that a suitable dosage is obtained. The dosage administered to a particular patient is variable, depending upon the clinician s judgment using as criteria the route of administration, the duration of treatment, the size and physical condition of the patient, the potency of the active component and the patient s response thereto. An effective dosage amount of the active component can thus only be determined by the clinician after a consideration of all criteria. and utilizing his best judgment on the patient s behalf. The structures of the compounds of the invention were established by the mode of synthesis, by elementary analyses and by ultraviolet, infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. The course of reactions and the homogeneity of the products were ascertained by thin layer chromatography. The manner and process of making and using the invention, and the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out the invention, will now be described so as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains to make and use the same. The melting points are uncorrected. Preparation of the Intermediates Of Formulas II, III and IV Preparation 1 A mixture of 98.4 g. 0.60 mole of 2 chloromethylpyridine hydrochloride and 204.36 g. of piperidine in about 2 liters of benzene was refluxed with stirring for about sixteen hours, and the mixture was filtered after cooling to ambient temperature. The filter was washed with small portions of ether, and the combined filtrates were taken to dryness.
