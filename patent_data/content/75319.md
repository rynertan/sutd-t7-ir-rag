# Control apparatus for d.c. power transmission system.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an apparatus for controll ing a D.C. power transmission system having a sepa rately excited converter 3 which is connected between a first A.C. system 1 and D.C. power transmission lines 6 and which performs power conversion be tween A.C. power and D.C. power, and a self excited converter 4 which is connected between the D.C. power transmission lines 6 and a second A.C. system 2 and which performs power conversion between A.C. power and D.C. power. In order to control transmission power in the two terminal D.C. power transmission system wherein the two A.C. systems 1, 2 are associated by direct current, a control apparatus for a D.C. power transmission system according to this invention com prises a voltage detector 10 which detects a D.C. voltage of the D.C. power transmission lines 6 , first control means 16 for comparing the output of the voltage detector 10 with a voltage reference signal and controlling ignition of the self excited converter 4 in accordance with a deviation of the comparison, a de tector 18 which detects the conversion power of the separately excited converter 3 , and second control means 17 for comparing the output of this detector 18 with a power reference signal and controlling igni tion of the separately excited converter 3 in accordance with a deviation of the comparison.
