# A combined seat back angle adjusting and angular vibration isolating mechanism for a vehicle seat.

## Abstract
An angular vibration isolating mechanism 10 is pro vided for a vehicle seat comprising a seat frame 16 , a seat cushion 14 and a seat back 12 , and this mechanism may be combined with a mechanism for adjusting the angle of the seat back. Eccentrically mounted cylindrically shaped cams 38 located at each side of the seat back 12 can be adjustably rotated around a shaft 32 within a guide channel 28 carried by the seat back 12 . The cams 38 are positioned at a distance from a pivot axis 22 on the seat frame 16 around which the seat back 12 can tilt in order to adjust the angle of tilt. The flange 42 of each of the guide channels 28 is spaced from its respective cam 38 by a resilient means such as a thick pad 41 of elastomeric material which fills the space between the cam and the a flange. The elastomeric pads 41 are compressed as the seat back 12 is forced forwardly against the seat occupant s back due to vehicle vibration, thus permitting the seat back to be driven rearwardly while the occupant s position in space remains relatively fixed.
