## Description
AIR OXIDATION OF KETOACIDS IN ORGANIC DILUENT MELT WITH MANGANESE CATALYST David A. O Brien BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The long chain dicarboxylic acids, dodecanedioic, undecanediolc and decanedioic acids, and their derivatives have considerable utility. These diacids may be subsequently converted to diperoxyacids which are useful bleach compounds. In addition, some of the esters of these acids may be used as synthetic lubricants or as plasticizers. The acids produced by the present invention also provide valuable chemical intermediates for the manufacture of resins such as polyesters and the like. Autoxidation and enolization of acetophenone in an acetic acid diluent with a Mn catalyst is reported in a Dutch paper by H. J.Den Hertog, Jr., et al., published in the Journal of Catalysis, 6, pp. 357 361 1966 . Alkyl chain length selectivity is not a problem in the oxidation of acetophenone because it lacks an alkyl chain of more than one carbon adjacent to the ketone carbonyl.The rate of this oxidation is also enhanced by the presence of the benzene ring adjacent to the carbonyl group. Specific autoxidations of ketones using manganese stearate as a catalyst are reported in a Russian paper by I. I. Korsak et al., Ser. Khim. Navuk, 1979, 1 , pp. 37 40. Oxidation of ketoacids under conditions set out in this Russian paper resulted in selected yields of diacids of less than 50 . U.S. Pat. No. 2,847,432 to T. R. Steadman and J. O. H.Peterson, issued August 12, 1958, describes a process for oxidizing an alkyl ester of 12 ketostearic acid which comprises reacting said compound with a nitric acid solution in the presence of a mixed catalyst containing a copper bearing material and a compound of vanadium. The reaction mixture contains dodecanedioic and undecanedioic acids. Difficulties are associated with nitric acid oxidation processes. Nitric acid is corrosive, produces a toxic waste stream upon reaction, and, in net, is expensive to use. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A process for oxidizing ketoacids in an organic diluent melt solution with air bubbles molecular oxygen In the presence of a manganese salt catalyst. The process provides selected diacids.The preferred process provides high yields of dodecanedloic, undecanedioic and decanedioic diacids from a solution of 12 ketostearic acid 12 KSA and stearic acid diluent. OBJECTS A principal object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing dicarboxylic acids from ketoacids. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing dicarboxylic acids from esters of ricinoleic acid, such as castor oil. Another object of the invention is to provide a process for producing dicarboxylic acids from 12 ketostearic acid. Still another object of the invention is to provide a process for producing acid mixtures comprised essentially of dodecanedioic, undecanedioic, and decanedioic acids from 12 ketostearic acid. Other objects of the invention will in part be obvious and will in part appear hereinafter. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention accordingly comprises the process involving the several steps and the relation and the order of one or more of such steps with respect to each of the others which are exemplified in the following detailed disclosure, and the scope of the application of which will be indicated in the claims. For a fuller understanding of the nature and objects of the invention, reference should be had to the following detailed description . There are four essential ingredients in the practice of the present invention ketoacids, organic diluent, manganese catalyst, and molecular oxygen. The ketoacids are C8 to C22 alkyl ketoacids. The preferred ketoacids are C16 to C20 alkyl ketoacids which provide selectedC3 to C18 diacids. 12 ketostearic acid is the most preferred. It can be obtained from castor oil via a process set out in U.S. Pat.No. 2,847,432 to T. R. Steadman and J. O. H. Peterson, issuedAugust 12, 1958. The ketoacids are melted and mixed with the catalyst and the organic diluent. The manganese catalyst is a C12 to C22 alkyl fatty acid salt.It is used at a level of about 0.028 to about 1 by weight of soluble manganese ion in the reaction solution. A level of 0.05 to 0.28 is preferred. Manganese stearate is the preferred catalyst. The organic diluent is preferably selected from C8 to C22 fatty acids, and C1 2 to C30 hydrocarbons. More preferably the diluent is C12 to C22 fatty acids which are primarily saturated.Other less preferred organic diluents, such as acetic acid, can be used. The key is that it should be miscible with the ketoacid, not participate in or promote undesired side reactions, and should itself withstand the reaction conditions. The oxygen source is preferably air which is bubbled through the reaction solution at a flow rate selected for efficient oxidation. Pure oxygen or a gas containing it can be used, but air is cheaper and preferred. The reaction is carried out at 850C to 1400C, preferably 950C to 110 C. For the preferred 12 ketostearic acid 12 KSA oxidation is done by using air bubbles, manganese stearate, and stearic acid with the ratio of 12 KSA to stearic acid beiny from 1 9 to 4 1, preferably from 2.5 1 to 1 2.5. The preferred temperature is 100 C. A source of 12 ketostearic acid 12 KSA is castor oil.Castor oil, a plentiful and cheap commodity, is comprised essentially of ricinolein, i.e., the triglyceride of ricinoleic acid.Ricinoleic acid or esters thereof contain both a hydroxy group and an unsaturated group. By the present invention, it is possible to obtain from esters of ricinoleic acid the valuable dicarboxylic acids containing 10, 11 and 12 carbon atoms and the valuable monocarboxylic acids containing 5, 6 and 7 carbon atoms. Thus, castor oil or a ricinoleate is isomerized to produce a 12ketostearate which Is then hydrolyzed to produce 1 2 ketostearic acid which is subsequently oxidatively cleaved to a mixture of mono and dicarboxylic acids. The isomerization of a ricinoleate is preferably carried out in the presence of an inert support carrying a catalyst selected from the group consisting of palladium, platinum, rhodium and ruthenium and at a temperature between 2000C and 3000C. The reaction is also preferably carried out in a closed system. See U.S. Pat. No. 2,847,432, Steadman et al., issued August 12, 1958, for more details. The 1 2 ketostearic acid formed by the above isomerization and hydrolysis reactions is then subjected to an oxidative cleavage to produce a mixture comprised essentially of mono and dicarboxylic acids. This acid mixture comprises a dicarboxylic acid, dodecanedioic acid, which contains the same number of carbon atoms between the carboxyl groups as the number of carbon atoms between the keto group and the carboxyl group of the 12 ketostearic acid starting material, also a dicarboxylic acid, undecanedioic acid, which contains one less carbon atom than the first mentioned dicarboxylic acid, and lesser amounts of decanedioic acid which contains 2 less carbon atoms than the firstmentioned dicarboxylic acid. There are also present the corresponding lower monocarboxylic acids, caproic and enanthic acids, from the other portion of the molecule being oxidized. These volatile monobasic acids are very useful in the manufacture of plasticizers and synthetic lubricants. The production of the desired dicarboxylic acids is preferably achieved by cleaving 1 2 ketostearic acid with oxygen at a temperature between about 850C and 1400C in the presence of a soluble manganese catalyst in an organic diluent. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the 12 ketostearic acid obtained from the isomerization of castor oil and the dicarboxylic acids produced therefrom are dodecanedioic, undecanedioic and decanedioic acids. This preferred embodiment of the invention calls for the cleavage reaction to be carried out in the presence of manganese at a level of about 0.02 to about 1 of soluble manganese by weight of the charge, i.e., the reaction solution. EXAMPLES Specific detailed methods for practicing the present invention are set forth in the following nonlimiting examples. EXAMPLE I A bubble reactor was constructed from a glass cylinder of approximately 150 mm in length and 24 mm in diameter. The bottom of this cylinder was fitted with a 20 mm diameter glass sparge tube with 10 20 m size pores. Into this reactor were weighed 3.50 gms of 12 ketostearic acid and 3.50 gms of stearic acid diluent. The 12 ketostearic acid was obtained by the isomerization of castor oil with a palladium catalyst as taught by the cited Steadman et al. patent followed by the hydrolysis of the resulting triglyceride, and the isolation of the 1 2 ketostearic acid by recrystallization from methanol. The stearic acid diluent used was reagent grade, fully saturated, and contained 2 palmitic acid. The reactor containing the stearic and 12 ketostearic acids was placed in a 1000C oil bath. Air was bubbled through the reactor at a rate of 215 mlslminute as measured under ambient conditions going into the reactor. Next, 0.088 gm of manganese Il stearate catalyst was added to the reactor, and an exit gas line leading to traps for evolved water and carbon dioxide was attached to the top of the reactor. The manganese Il ion in the melt was about 0.11 . Aliquots of approximately 0.25 gm were taken from the reactor at the intervals listed below, silated, and analyzed by gas liquid chromatography. Lauric acid was used as an internal standard. It will be noted in Table 1 that at about 60 minutes the best selectivity was found. Of the C10 C12 diacids found in the 60 minute sample, 41 was C12 diacid, 4396 was C11 diacid, and 16 was C10 diacid. This distribution was about the same for the other samples in Table 1.

Consumed Diacids Diacids 30 26.1 12.0 71.5 60 38.4 23.4 93.9 120 66.8 33.5 78.0 180 80.2 40.1 77.9 240 87.9 42.6 75.4 300 92.8 43.5 74.2 1 Grams of C1 C12 diacids produced per gram of reactant 12 ketostearic acid orig inally charged to the reactor. The weights of the diluent and catalyst are excluded from the total sample weight upon which the percentage of diacids is calculated. Included in the total sample weight are the short mostly C5 C7 monoacids which are relatively volatile and partially stripped from the reactor by the air stream.This lost weight was calculated from the fact that 1 mole of monoacid is produced for each mole of diacid produced by oxidative cleavage of a ketoacid. 2 Selectivity is moles of C10 C12 diacids produced per mole of 12 ketostearic acid consumed. EXAMPLE II The same equipment, materials, and conditions described inExample I were employed, except that the temperature was set at 1200C and a charge of 7.0 gms of 12 ketostearic acid was substituted for the 50 50 mixture of stearic acid and 12 ketostearic acid. Also, the level of manganese stearate catalyst was slightly higher t0.14 ym . These conditions corresponded essentially to the preferred conditions taught by Korsak et al. for the oxidation of simple ketones. The acid functionality taught by Korsak et al.is supplied by the ketoacid itself. As in Example I aliquots were taken over time and analyzed by g.l.c.

Consumed Diacids Diacids 30 11.2 2.5 34.6 60 54.8 14.2 40.3 90 79.9 23.7 44.8 120 93.1 28.1 47.0 180 99.9 30.1 46.8 1 Grams of C10 Cl2 diacids produced per gram of reactant 12 ketostearic acid orig inally charged to the reactor. The weights of the diluent and catalyst are excluded from the total sample weight upon which the percentage of diacids is calculated. Included in the total sample weight are the short mostly C5 C7 monoacids which are relatively volatile and partially stripped from the reactor by the air stream. This lost weight was calculated from the fact that 1 mole of monoacid is produced for each mole of diacid produced by oxidative cleavage of a ketoacid. 2 Selectivity is moles of C10 C12 diacids produced per mole of 12 ketostearic acid consumed. As shown in Example II, the oxidation of 1 2 KSA under the Korsak et al. conditions yielded less than 50 selected C10 C12 diacids. This assumes that the ketoacid provides the acid moiety provided by the stearic acid catalyst taught by Korsak et al. It was surprising that 858 to 95 selectivity could be obtained under the conditions of this invention, as illustrated in Example I.
