# Digital scan converter with randomized decay function.

## Abstract
Analog video information with a wide range of radar characteristics is converted by a digital scan converter into a standard TV format. The analog video information is converted to digital PPI data and stored in a buffer 100 . The digital PPI data is consecutively integrated on a pulse to pulse basis to eliminate noise. The digital PPI data is then stored in an image memory 105 . The polar coordinates of each digital PPI data sample are converted to an address of equivalent X, Y coordinates wherein each point along a TV line is a Y coordinate. This address defines the location at which the data is stored in the image memory 105 . Each address of X, Y coordinates uniquely defines a cell in the image memory 105 , which is three bits deep, describing eight inten sity levels. Data is read from the image memory 105 in time sequence with a TV synchronization for display on a TV monitor 108 . During TV memory cycles, an N element word is read from the image memory 105 , to drive the video output circuits, processes through a programmable read only memory 106 programmed in accordance with a randomized decay function and writ ten back into the same memory address. During radar cycles, an N bit word is read from the image memory 105 and one bit in each word is updated in accordance with the new radar data.
