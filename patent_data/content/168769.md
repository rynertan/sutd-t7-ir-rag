# PROCESS FOR PREPARING CARBOXYALKYL DIPEPTIDES

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for preparing a carboxyalkyl di peptide compound which comprises a protecting a peptide with a protecting group which is an Î± fluorinated acyl group represented by the general for mula The protecting groups employed in this process permit them to be removed concurrently with obtaining the desired dipeptide compounds thereby avoiding the need for step wise removal of such groups in separate reactions before the de sired dipeptide compounds can be obtained.
