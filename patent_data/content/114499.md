# A SYSTEM TO DETERMINE ARTERIAL OCCLUSION AND OTHER MALADIES

## Abstract
A system for noninvasively sensing ocular pulses of a mammal, which pulses serve as a basis for indicating presence of a disease or malfunctioning body part such as, for example, a condition of arterial occlusion. The system employs piezoelectric transducers to sense the ocular pulses which are analyzed, also, in the case of arterial occlusion with simultaneously obtained ECG signals.
