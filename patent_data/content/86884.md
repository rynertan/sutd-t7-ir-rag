## Description
LOW TEEIPERATURE PREPARATION OF GWHITIZED CARBONS USING BORON AND SILICONThe present invention is directed to a method for enhancing the corrosion resistance of carbonaceous components of a fuel cell. In particular the present invention is directed to a method for enhancing the corrosion resistance of carbonaceous components in a fuel cell by doping the carbon with boron or silicon and graphitizing the carbon by heating.A typical fuel cell is an electrochemical cell comprising a matrix for holding electrolyte and an electrode disposed on each side of the matrix and in contact therewith. Reactant gases such as hydrogen as fuel and oxygen as oxidant may be fed to the nonelectrolyte facing side of each electrode. In a stack of fuel cells separator plates may be disposed between adjacent cells. Due to the low solubility of reactant gases, such as hydrogen and oxygen in electrolytes, the fuel cell reactions take place at the electrode electrolyte interface. The required surface area at the interface is typically obtained utilizing porous materials which fulfill the functions of providing contact between electrolyte and gas, catalyzing the reaction, maintaining the electrolyte in a very thin area on the surface of the electrode, and acting as leads for the transmission of electrons.In typical aqueous electrolyte fuel cells, several of the components may comprise carbonaceous material, such as the cathode, separator plates and current collectors. A particular problem in acid electrolyte fuel cells is that at operating temperatures, typically above 2000 C, the carbonaceous components are particularly susceptible to corrosion. The frequency of replacement of such corroded carbonaceous components may be a major disadvantage of fuel cells which may make them less commercially attractive than other sources of electrical energy.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for fabricating carbonaceous components for fuel cells which exhibit enhanced resistance to corrosion under fuel cell operating conditions.It is a further object of the present invention to provide fuel cells which exhibit enhanced resistance to corrosion at operating temperatures and conditions.In the accompanying drawings Figure 1 is a graph of do half the carbon cell unit c dimension of heat treated undoped and boron doped graphitized carbon versus heat treatment temperature.Figure 2 is a graph of do heat treated undoped and borondoped graphitized carbon versus BET surface area.Figure 3 is a graph of do of heat treated undoped and silicon doped graphitized carbon versus heat treatment temperature.Figure 4 is a graph of do of heat treated undoped and silicon doped graphitized carbon versus BET surface area.Figure 5 is a graph of Tafel slope versus do for heattreated undoped and silicon doped graphitized carbons. According to the present invention, carbonaceous components for fuel cells, in particular the cathodes, may be provided which exhibit enhanced resistance to corrosion by introducing boron or silicon into the carbonaceous material utilized in the fuel cell component. Subsequent heat treatment of the carbonaceous boron containing or siliconcontaining mixture produces graphitized carbon having enhanced corrosion resistance. Furthermore the degree of lattice ordering hereinafter referred to as graphitization which is achieved by the method according to the present invention is greater than the degree of graphitization which may be achieved by heat treating the carbonaceous material in absence of boron or silicon. The closeness of approach for the lattice ordering do to 3.35A defines the degree of graphitization.According to the present invention, boron may be introduced into carbonaceous material conventionally utilized in the production in components for fuel cells. Carbonaceous material such as carbon black may be intimately mixed with a boric acid solution by ultrasonic agitation, forming a slurry which is then evaporated to dryness. The concentration of the boric acid solution and the proportions of the solution mixed with carbon are not particularly critical, however, slurries formed utilizing from about 80 to about 98 carbon by weight with 20 to 2 by weight boric acid in a 0.3M solution are preferred. The slurry may then be dried and the resulting mixed solids heated for approximately one hour at temperatures ranging from 1000 2000 C in an inert atmosphere.After the heat treatment the boron doped carbon may be rinsed, for example, in boiling distilled water to remove residual boric acid. Heat treatment at a temperature sufficient to graphitize the carbons is necessary. Such a temperature may be as low as 10000 C. While at least 16000 C is preferred, heat treatment above 25000 C may provide improved graphitized carbon according to the present invention. However, temperatures less than about 25000 C are preferred.It has been found that boron doped carbon which has been heat treated as described above exhibits superior resistance to corrosion at fuel cell cathode operating conditions.Resistance to corrosion is particularly advantageous when the boron doped carbon is heat treated from 10000 16000 C.The boron content of the heat treated graphitized carbon may vary depending on the rate of cooling. However, the degree of graphitization which occurs is not due only to heat treatment. The presence of boron is believed to be critical to achieving the degree of graphitization attainable according to the present invention.Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a plot of do half the carbon unit cell c dimension versus the temperature of heat treatment for heat treated Vulcan Cabot s Vulcan XC 72R samples undoped or doped by boron. The value for do for natural graphite is 3.35A, therefore, it may be seen fromFigure 1 that a higher degree of graphitization may be obtained by boron doping and heat treatment at a lower temperature rather than by heat treatment alone. Figure 1 shows that in heat treatments above 14000 C the borondoped carbons have a do less than 3.47 .Referring to Figure 2, there is shown a plot of d0 for heat treated Vulcan XC 72R and heat treated boron dopedVulcan XC 72R versus BET Brunauer Emmett Teller method surface areas. It may be seen from Figure 2 that the least graphitic boron doped carbon which is that carbon treated at 16000 C having the do which deviates most from the value of 3.35 has a higher BET surface area and a higher degree of graphitization than the most graphitic undoped carbon which is the undoped carbon heat treated at approximately 30000 . As shown in Figure 2, all of the heat treated boron doped carbons have higher BET surface areas than the most graphitic undoped carbon.Thus, the achievement of substantially improved BET surface area is a further advantage of the present invention since it is advantageous to have the highest surface area possible in fuel cell components, particularly wherein the surface involves catalytic reactions.Carbonaceous components of fuel cells exhibiting enhanced resistance to corrosion may also be provided according to the present invention by doping carbon with silicon and heat treating. According to the present invention carbon black which may be used in the manufacture of components for fuel cells may be slurried with fumed silicon oxide Cabot s Cab O Sil . Alternatively, the carbon black may be impregnated with silicon by mixing with an agueous solution of sodium silicate. Preferably, the carbon black may be slurried with fumed silicon oxide, evaporated to dryness and heat treated for approximately one hour at approximately 8000 C in an inert atmosphere. If the impregnation method is used, the silicon impregnated carbon may be heated at 23000 C for approximately one hour in an inert atmosphere. In either method, subsequent to heat treatment the carbon may be boiled in aqueous sodium hydroxide to remove unreacted silicon oxide.Heat treatment at a temperature sufficient to graphitize the carbon is necessary. Such temperature may be as low as 14000 C. A temperature of at least 18000 C is preferred.Heat treatment as temperatures greater than 18000 C may provide improved graphitized carbon according to the present invention, however, temperatures less than about 25000 C are preferred. Referring to Figure 3, there is shown a plot of do versus heat treatment temperatures for samples of turbostratic carbon black Cabot s Vulcan XC 72R made by slurrying with fumed silicon oxide. As may be seen from Figure 3, the silicon doped samples exhibit a do value closer to 3.35 than the undoped samples, thereby indicating a higher degree of graphitization for the silicon doped samples.Referring to Figure 4, there is shown a plot of do versus for silicon doped and undoped carbon samples. As may be seen from Figure 4, the silicon doped samples not only are more highly graphitized, but also exhibit a higher BET surfa ce area than even the most graphitized undoped sample.Referring to Figure 5, there is shown a plot of Tafel slopes the slope of potential versus logarithm of current density at 1000 minutes versus do for heat treated undoped and silicon doped carbon. It may be seen from Figure 5, that the silicon doped carbon exhibits lower Tafel slopes than the undoped heat treated samples. A low value for theTafel slope means that corrosion currents are lower at potentials of interest in fuel cells 0.65 0.8 V than those for materials showing higher Tafel slopes.Shown below in Table 1 is a summary of properties shown inFigures 3, 4 and 5 of silicon doped versus undoped carbon.Additionally, in Table 1 there is shown a comparison of corrosion resistance, as evidenced by the corrosion current at 1000 minutes. The corrosion test procedure is described by EPRI Publication No. EM 1664, p. A l 1981 , published by the Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto,California 94303.

It may be seen from Table II that, although resistance to corrosion in the heat treated boron doped samples improves with higher temperature of heat treatment, treatments above 16000 C exhibit only small improvements.
