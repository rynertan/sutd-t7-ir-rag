## Description
BEVERAGE DISPENSING LID FOR A CUP Background of the Invention This invention relates generally to lids for enclosing cups containing a beverage such as coffee, hot chocolate, or the like. More specifically, this invention relates to a lid which permits a person to consume the beverage contained within the cup without removing the lid. It is known to use a lid to completely seal a cup to prevent the beverage contained therein from being accidently spilled. Other types of lids, such as commonly used to enclose a cup containing a soft drink, have a slit or a perforated area to permit the insertion of a straw therethrough. However, it is not desireable, or convenient at all times to drink certain beverages through a straw. But it is desireable to provide a means permitting the consumption of a beverage and at the same time controlling the flow of the beverage. Thus, lids with straw insertion openings do not permit. the direct consumption of beverages from a container while providing protection against spillage. It is an object of the present invention to solve this problem by providing a new and novel lid which permits the direct consumption of beverages therefrom while providing protection against spillage due to normal handling. Summary of the Invention A lid embodyinq this invention includes an upstanding wall and a bottom connected to the lower part of the wall to define the reservoir. A means is provided for sealing the lid to the edge of a cup to prevent the leakage of beverage therebetween. The bottom has at least one hole therein so that when the cup is tipped the beverage will flow through the hole into the reservoir permitting the consumer to drink the beverage from the reservoir. Brief Description of the Drawings The structure and function of embodiments of the present invention may be understood by reference to the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a lid embodying the present invention seated upon a cup Figure 2 is a partial cross sectional view taken about line 2 2 in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a perspective view of another lid embodying the present invention seated upon a cup and Figure 4 is a partial cross sectional view along line 4 4 of Figure 3. Detailed Description Figures 1 and 2 illustrate a lid 10 according to the present invention seated upon the upper edge or periphery 12 of a cup 14. The lid includes a bottom 16 and an annular invertedU shaped flange 17 having an annular upstanding wall 18 and spaced apart outside wall 20. The lid is preferably molded as a unitary structure from a resilient plastic material. The lid is dimensioned to be utilized with a specific size of cup 14 so that the walls 18 and 20 engage the upper edge of the cups to provide a water tight seal. Preferably, walls 18 and 20 immediately below edge 12 are dimensioned so that they are slightly spread apart when seated upon cup 14. The cup may be made of a reasonably soft styrene foam and dimensioned so that its wall is slightly compressed when the lid is seated thereon to obtain a good seal. It will be noted that the seal is enhanced if wall 18 is contiguous with the inside surface of the wall of cup 14. The bottom 16 includes a hole or opening 22 at its periphery so as to permit beverage 24 to flow into the reservoir 25 defined by the bottom and wall 18 when the cup is tipped or tilted toward the hole as shown in Figure 1. Preferably a second hole 26 is located opposite hole 22 near the periphery of the bottom and serves as an inlet permitting air to enter the cup as the beverage exits through hole 22 thereby preventing a vacuum from being formed which would inhibit the beverage flow. It is important that the wall 18 extend a sufficient distance above the bottom 16 so that the consumer can engage the walls 18, 20 between his lips so as to sip a hot beverage from the reservoir 25 without getting burned. A wall 18 should extend beyond the bottom 16 by at least 0.25 inches and preferably 0.5 inches.The diameter of hole 22 is preferably substantial, such as 0.25 inches, so that the beverage within the cup encounters only a limited resitance in flowing from the cup into the reservoir. It will be noted that the exterior surface 27 of the wall 20 immediately adjacent upper edge 12 of the cup is substantially parallel to wall 18 to present a comfortable structure for engagement with one s lips. Lid 10 is preferably dimensioned so that a plurality of lids can be nested one on top of another to form a stack of lids. The remote portion 28 of wall 20 is spaced apart from wall 18 so as to provide clearance for the upper edge 12 of another lid to enter between the remote portion 28 and wall 18. A reentrant indentation 30 intermediate of remote portion 28 and the juncture of walls 18 and 20 is spaced apart from wall 18 so as to apply a force against the external surface of the wall 20 of another lid as the latter is slid beyond indentation 30. Thus, each of the lids in a nested stack interlock with adjacent lids for stability and compact storage. The lid and cup combination illustrated in Figure 1 is suited for containing an individual serving of coffee which is to be consumed at a location other than the point of purchase. For example, commuters may purchase coffee in such a container for consumption during their travel by car or train to work. The lid 10 prevents the coffee from being spilled due to normal handling or typical ride variations while allowing the coffee to be directl consumed. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate lid 32 which comprises another embodiment of the present invention in combination with a plastic mug or cup 34. The lid 32 includes a reservoir 35 defined by a bottom 36, an upstanding annular wall 40 and an inwardly inclined wall 38 connecting the bottom 36, with the wall 40. The bottom includes a beverage dispensing hole 42 adjacent the periphery of the bottom and an air inlet hole 44 opposite hole 42. The bottom 36, which is perferably planar, is disposed at an angle with respect to a horizontal plane with hole 44 adjacent the uppermost portion of the botom and with hole 42 adjacent the lower most portion of the bottom.This construction permits a greater volume of beverage 46 to be held within the reservoir when tipped generally toward hole 42 than if the bottom were disposed horizontally at the level of hole 44. This construction provides an additional advantage in that most of the beverage contained within the reservoir will drain via hole 42 back into the mug when the mug is held in a vertically upright horizontal position as shown in Figure 4. This prevents any undesired accumulation of beverage in the reservoir. The dimensions permit the lid to be seated on the upper edge of a mug which may have an externally flared peripheral rim 48 so that the entirety of the bottom 36 is below the level of the rim. This permits the upstanding wall 40 to extend above the cup by a lesser distance than if the bottom were located at a higher level. The inwardly sloping wall 38 enables the reservoir of lid 32 to be easily cleaned since neither 90 nor acute angles are present. The lid 32 includes a means for tightly engaging the rim 48 of the mug such as by an angular downwardly turned flange 50. Preferably the lid 32 is integrally molded as a unitary structure from a somewhat resilient plastic material. The diameter of the flange 5 is dimensioned slightly smaller than the diameter of rim 48 so that the lid snap locks onto the mug.A horizontal tab 52 may be provided to extend from the remote end of flange 50 and provide a means for grasping lid 32 so that it can be easily removed, that is unseated, from mug 34 by applying a generally upward force to the tab. Mug 34 may include a handle 54 and is preferably formed from a plastic thermallyinsulating material in accordance with the which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The materials from which lids according to the invention may be made are numerous and include both styrene and propylene. The thickness of the bottoms and walls can be selected by the designer. For instance, a lid according to the invention may be designed to be relatively thick so as to provide thermal insulation if desired. Although embodiments of the present invention have been described above and illustrated in the drawings, the scope of the present invention is defined by the claims appended hereto.
