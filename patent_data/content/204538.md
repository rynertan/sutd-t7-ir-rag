# PHOTOTREATING METHOD AND APPARATUS THEREFOR

## Abstract
A phototreating method comprises the steps of introduc ing a photoreactive gas into a chamber 11 housing a work piece 12 , emitting first light substantially perpendicularly to a surface of the workpiece 12 , and emitting second light substantially perpendicularly to the surface of the workpiece 12 simultaneously with or after radiation of the first light. The surface of the workpiece 12 is treated utilizing a photo chemical reaction of the photoreactive gas caused by radia tion of the first light and or the second light.
