# Apparatus including a turbine, a condenser and a support arrangement therefor.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a support arrangement for steam turbine having an exhaust port for exhausting mo tive fluid therethrough and a condensing apparatus ar ranged below the turbine in fluid communication there with through the exhaust port. The condenser has an outer wall 26 disposed below and flexibly joined to the bottom 24 of the condenser 12 so as to define with the condenser bottom a vacuum balancing chamber. Means 30 are pro vided rigidly connecting the outer wall 26 to tne turbine 10 , for transmitting the atmospheric pressure forces from the outer wall to the turbine so as to limit the load on the turbine s support structure to the turbines weight. With this arrangement the turbine support structure needs to be designed only for the turbine weight.
