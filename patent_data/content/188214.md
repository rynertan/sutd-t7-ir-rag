## Description
NOVEL GROWTH HORMONE RELEASING PEPTIDES AND METHOD OF TREATING MAMMALS THEREWITH This application is a continuation in part of application Serial No. 692,082, filed January 7, 1985, which is a continuation in part of application Serial No.605,520, filed April 30, 1984, which is a continuation inpart of application Serial No 522,067, filed August 10, 1983. The present invention relates to novel growth hormone releasing peptides and method for increasing the release of growth hormone levels in mammals therewith.Further, methods for increasing milk production in dairy cows result when the novel growth hormone releasing peptides of the present invention are administered to those cows. Recently, growth hormone releasing factors GRF of human pancreatic islet tumor origin hpGRF were isolated, characterized, and shwon to possess growh hormone GH releasing activity in rat anterior pituitary in vitro and in vivo by 1 Guillemin, P. Brazeau, P Böhlen, F. Esch, N. Ling, and W. B. Wehrenberg Science, 218, 585 1982 and 2 J. Spiess, J. Rivier, M. Thorner, and W.Vale Biochemistry, 21, 6037 1082 . Further, a synthetic hp GRF 29 NH2, an amidated fragment of the natural hp GRF 1 29 NH2, an amidated fragment of the natural hpGRF, was reported to possess full intrinsic biological activity by Spiess et al. of reference 2 .

Surprisingly, this objective is achieved by replacing the natural amino acid residues in positions 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 12, 21 and 27, as well as derivatizing theN terminal amino acid residue in hpGRF 1 to 29, 1 to 40 and 1 to 44 as expressed below by the structural formulas I , II , and III respectively provided that at least one of two natural amine acid residues in the 2,9, 10, 12 or 21 positions of the hpGRF 1 to 29, 1 to 40 or 1 to 44 is replaced in the 2 position with N methylalanyl or N methylD alanyl in the 9 position with D seryl in the 10 position with D tyrosyl or in the 12 and 21 positions with arginyl. These achievements are unexpected especially in view of reports by N. Ling and P. Brazeau The EndocrineSociety Program and Abstracts, 65th Annual Meeting, No.295, June 8 to 10, 1983, at San Antonio, Texas which indicate that AC Tyrl and D Tyr1 hpGRF analogs have low potency with respect to the natural peptide, and by J. Rivier et al. abstract 8th American Peptide Symposium, May 2227, 1983, paper 10 B , who indicated for hpGRF 1 27 that some manipulation of the Tyr residue is compatible as long as a free amino terminus is conserved.

Preparative HPLC can be performed on a thick walled glass column 2.5 x 45 cm containing Whatman LRP 1 reverse phase packing C18 silica 13 22 pm pumped with Fluid Metering Company pump and pulse damper.Amino acid analyses can be run on a Beckman 119 CL analyzer and processed with a SystemAA computing integrator. Amino acid derivatives utilized in the prepar at ion of the compounds of the present invention are available from several chemical supply houses including Bachem, Inc., Torrance, California, and Chemical Dynamics Inc., Plainfield, New Jersey. The peptides having the Formulas I , II , and I II configurations can be conveniently prepared by standard solid phase techniques for example, theC terminal protected amino acid can be attached to a chloromethyl resin, a hydroxymethyl resin, a benzhydrylamine BHA resin or a p methylbenzylhydrylamine p Me BHA resin. One such chloromethyl resin is sold under the trade name Bio Beads SX 1 by Bio Rad Laboratories,Richmond, California. The preparation of the hydroxymethyl resin is described by Bodansky et al., Chem.Ind. London 38, 1597 1966 . The BHA resin has been described by Pietta and Marshall, Chem. Commun. 650 1970 and commercially available from Bachem, Inc.. Torrance, California. According to an embodiment of the invention the peptides of Formulas I , II , and III are prepared by means of solid phase peptide synthesis by standard procedures, although it may also be prepared by treatment of the peptide resin with ammonia to give the desired side chain protected amide or with an alkylamine to give a side chain protected alkylamide or dialkylamide. The a amino protecting group is Fmoc for the amino acid in position one, and the side chain protecting group is Boc instead of Z for the appropriate preceeding amino acid, when the chloromethyl or hydroxymethyl resin is used. Side chain protection can then be removed in the usual fashion by treatment with HF to give the free peptide amides, alkylamides, or dialkylamides. In preparing the esters of this invention, the resins used to prepare the acids of Formulas I , II , and III R2 OH can be employed, and the side chain protected peptide can be cleaved with a base and appropriate alcohol, i.e., methanol. Side chain protecting groups can then be removed in the usual fashion by treatment with HF to obtain the desired ester. The solid phase procedure discussed above is well known in the art and has been essentially described by Stewart and Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis,Freeman and Company, San Francisco, California 1969 .
