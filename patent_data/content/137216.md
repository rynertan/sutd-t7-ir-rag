# Fluorelastomer having improved compression set resistance.

## Abstract
A peroxide curable fluoroelastomer composition where in the composition comprises a tetrapolymer whose inter polymerized units consist essentially of units derived from 1 about 30 40 weight percent vinylidene fluoride, 2 about 30 40 weight percent of the fluorine containing monomers hexafluoropropylene or pentafluoropropylene, 3 about 25 35 weight percent tetrafluoroethylene and 4 up to 3 mole percent of units, based upon the tetrapolymer, derived from a bromine containing olefin, with the proviso that enough of such units are present to provide 0.05 weight percent bromine in the tetrapolymer, the units of the bromine containing olefin are derived from a compound having the formula CX₂ CX CY₂
