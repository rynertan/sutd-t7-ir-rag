# Method of solidifying radioactive solid waste.

## Abstract
A method of solidifying radioactive waste wherein radioactive solid waste 1 of a predetermined shape are embedded in a solidifying material 2 which has a modulus of elasticity that is equal to, or smaller than, the modulus of elasticity of said waste, to provide a solidified body. The modulus of elasticity of the solidifying material is adjusted to be equal to, or smaller than, that of the radioactive solid waste, in order to prevent stress concentra tions at the boundaries between the solidifying material and the radioactive solid waste, particularly on the solidifying material side thereof. The invention makes it possible to prepare a solidified body 3 with a desired durability and safety factor.
