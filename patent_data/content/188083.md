## Abstract
The tool 1 shown is a drill which has a generally cylindrical shank 2 for insertion in a tool receiver or holder of a rotary percussive or rotary machine such as a drilling machine not shown . The shank 2 has a curved surface portion 3 and a flat surface portion 4 of rectangular configuration, the flat surface portion 4 lying between the ends of the shank. When the shank 1 is inserted in a tool receiver of a rotary percussive machine not shown , driving elements thereof engage and act on the flat surface 4 to provide driving torque to the tool, which is thereby rotated.
