# Method of making a coated cemented carbide body and resulting body.

## Abstract
In coating cemented carbide or ceramics with thin, wear resistant layers of ceramic oxide, particularly aluminium oxide, by precipitaion from a gaseous phase an improved method is now available by which a considerable increase of the growth rate of the layer as well as optimal properties regarding evenness and thickness of the layer, have been obtained by a well adjusted addition of P, As, Sb and or Bi, making the product better suited for cutting operations.
