## Description
AN AUTOMATIC ANIMAL TRAPPING DEVICE The present invention relates to an automatic animal trapping device, mor particularly, to a kindiof animaltrapping device, used for trapping mice and other like wild animals, which may repeat its operating cycle all over again and catch lots of mice in continuity with special functions of its automatic control mechanisms. Heretofore, many types of mouse animal trapping device have been disclosed for practical use, notwithstanding neither type of them has been proposed with automatic control mechanism and special design. Therefore, after catching one mouse any one Of said conventional mouse animal trapping device will automatical ly bloc its mechanism and lose its mechanial function so that it can not catch lots of mice with a continuity of operation. It is therefore the primary abject of the present invention to overcome these drawbacks to provide an auto mti animal trapping device having novel construction wliicli certainly has an improved effect. Anottler object of the present invention is to provide at automatical animal trapping device which has many sets of automatic control mechanism. When the animal trapping device catches one ouuse, the device will automatically close its entrance and transport the trapped mouse into a confinement cell by means of transporting mechanism of an elevator. After that, the device will then automatically open its entrance and also restore control functions of all automatic control mechanisms. A further object of the present invention is to disclose an automatic animal trapping device which has the advantage of automatic control operation. The present invention will be further described by way of specific example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view of an automatic animaltrapping device of the present invention.

Fig. 8 is a plane view of the control mechanism for the elevator in accordance with the invention. Fig. 9 is a view showing an electric switch. Referring to the Figures, the automatic animal trapping device of the present invention is mainly composed of a hallway mechanism 10, an elevator 12, a lifting plate 14, an an automatic control mechanism i for the elevator, and an automatic control mechanism 18 for the lifting plate. As shown in Fig. 1 3, the hallway mechanism 10 is divided into two parts which are the upper compartment lOa, to be ti c third hallway 24, and the lower compartment 10b includ ing the first hallway 20 and the second hallway 22. The first hallway 20 is a casing 26 opened at its both opposing ends, in which the froiit entrance 2n opened at front efid is equipp ed with a lifting plate 14 able to be automatically cojitroll ed in its rise and the fall and the rear entrance opened at the other end is equipped with a turning plate 30 capable of opening and closing in the same one direction, in which the rear entrance is communicated with the first opening 32 of the second hallway 22. In the inner side of the casing 26, bait can be placed for luring mice, and a pedal switch 34a is set for controlling the fall of the lifting plate 14. The second opening 36 of the second hallway 22 is also equipped with a turning plate 38 capable of opening and closing in the same one direction, in which said second opening 36 may properly communicate with and correspond to the opening 40 of the elevator 12 able to lift up and lower down when the elevator 12 lowers down completely to the lower compartment lOb. Third hallway 24 is to be a housing 44 having an opening 42 the size of which may be also properly communicating with and corresponding to the opening 40 of the elevator 12. Also shown are two respective turning plates 48, 50, which are all capable of opening and closing in the same one direction, and a pedal switch 46 used for controlling the rise of the lifting plate 14 and the fall of the elera tor 12 within the inner side of the housing 44. The inner room 52 within the housing 44 has a port 56 comprising a turning plate 54 so that mice will fall into the confine ment cell 58 in the lower compartment lOb from the port 56 when they bump away the turning plate 54 through careless ness. Referring now specifically to Fig. 4, the automatic control mechanism 18 for the lifting plate 14 performs by means of a motor 60 to drive a first clutching pulley 64 and a second clutching pulley 66 rotating respectively along the arrow A and B direction through a transmission gear set 62. The driven pulley 66a of the second clutching pulley 66 is wound round by a steel wire 68 connected at its other end to the extending portion 74 of the control rod 72 belonging to the control mechanism 70. A coil compressed spring 76 is provided on said extending portion 74.Therefore, when the motor 60 is operating and power transmitted to drive the driving pulley 66b for the second clutching pulley 66 which will be involved to make the driven pulley 66a rotate in the arrow B direction, the steel wire 68 w111 be pulled to retract the control rod 72 along the arrow direction appearing in Fig. 5. However, the driving pulley 66b does nt engage with the driven pulley 66a in relationship, thus the driven pulley 66a will be running idle after being moved by the driving pulley 66b to run one pitch to retract the control rod 72, and then the control rod 72 will move back to its original position by means of the function of the restitutive force of the coil compressed spring 76. The driven pulley 66a of the first clutcbing pulley 6 I, is also wound round by a steel wire 78 connected to its other said, penetrating a fixed hole 80, to the upper side of the lifting plate 14.Therefore, when the motor 60 operates through the transmission gear set 62 to drive the driving pulley 64b of t1 e first clutching pulley 64 which will be involved to rotate the driven pulley 64a in the arrow A direction, the driven pulley 64a will then roll up the steel wire 78 and lift up the lifting plate 14. Furthermore, referring Fig. 6, the driven pulley 64a of the first clutching pulley 64 is equipped with a ring 82 having a connecting rod 84 connected to the front end of the crank 88 which is capable of pivoting tip and down in the space between C and D under the function of a linkage 86 to which the other end of the crank 88 is connected.As a result of this construction, the linkage 8G will shift downward under pressure of the elevator 12 when the elevator 12 lowers down to the lower compartment 10b so as to make the craiik 88 rotate in the arrow C direction atid force the driven plllle 64a shifting in E direction to retract the said driven pulley 64a from the engaging position with the driving pulley G4b. At this movement, when the motor 60 is switched on to operate, the driven pulley 64a will be turning idle and the second clutching pulley 66 will be run to retract the control rod 72 as aboe mentioned so t11at the lifting plate 14 laid oii ttie front end of said control rod 72 will automatically slip down, which will pull the steel wire 78 to make the driven pulley 64a turn idle freely in counterclockwise arsow A direction and then loosen the steel wire 78. However, the force on the linkage 86 disappears when the elevator 12 lifts up, the driven pulley 64a will be therefore back to its engaging position with the driving pulley 64b under the function of the tensive force of a tension spring 90. As shown in Fig. 8, the automatic control mechanis 16 for the elevator includes a transmission gear set 94, operated t X means of the motor 92, which is used for rotating the pulley 96 winded round by a steel wire 98. The other end of the steel wire 98 is fixed on the upper side of the elevator 12. Thus, when the motor 92 operates to rotate said pulley g6 in clock direction by controlling an electricty switch 100, the steel wire 98 will be rolled up to lift up the elevator 12. On the contrary, when the motor 92 operates to rotate said pulley 96 in counter clock direction by controlling the electricitv switch 100, the elevator 12 will automatically lower down to its original position. As indicated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 9, said electricity switch 100 may covert direction of electricity current and magnetic force of the coil of the motor 92 by means of shifting connectioii of the spring plate 104 provided on the lever 102 so that it ma control the motor 92 to run in clock o counter clock direction. The lever 102 is equipped at its front end with a connecting wire 106 connected to the top side of the lifting plate 14 and at its another end with a tension spring 108. When the lifting plate 14 lowers down, the front end of the lever 102 under the function of tensive force of the connecting wire 1o6 shifts downward to make the spring plate 1o4 capable of contact with the lower spring plate 110.Therefore, the motor 92 will operate and be transmitted to rotate the pulley 96 in clock direction to lift up the elevator 12. And when the lifting plate 14 lifts up, the tensive force on the front end of the Sever 102 disappears and then said front end will shift upward under te function of tensive force of the tensive 108 on the other end of the lever 102, which wçill make the spring plate 104 capable of contact with the upper spring plate 112. The motor 92 will then operate and be caused to rotate the pulley 96 in a counterclockwise direction to lower down the elevator 12. Tlie constructions and installaticns of this invention Ilave 1 een described above in every detailed. For a further understanding of the actual operation of this invention it should have the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. In accordance with the automatic animal trapping device of title present invention, a doo1 wring 113 able to be arbitrarily opened and closed is mount d on the other side of the casiiig 2 of the first hallway 20 so that the door wing may be opened to place bait in the first hallway 20 for luring mice entering into the first hallway 20 from the front entrance 28 in the front end of the casing 26.When one mouse steps on the pedal switch 34a, said pedal switch 34a will be switched on to start to running the motor 60 driving the driving pulley 66b of the second clutching pulley 66 which will involved to making the driven pulley 66a rotate in the arrow B direction, and then the steel wire 68 will be pulled to retract the control rod 72. At this moment, the lifting plate 14 laid on the front end of the control rod 72 will automatically slip down and close the front entrance 28 of the first hallway 20. After that, the mouse will naturally fall into a panic and flee in a hurry into the second hallway 22 by bumping away the turning plate 30. In the second hallway 22, the mouse will naturally, once again, bump away the turning plate 38 and flee into the eleator 12 to touch switch on the pedal switch 34b set within the elevator 12. The ,otor 92, belonging to the automatic control mechanism 16 for the elevator, will then operate to make the pulley 96 rotate in clockwise direction so as to roll up the steel wire 98 to lift up the elevator 12. When the opening 40 of the elevator and the opening 42 of the third hallway 24 are in contmwiication with each other, the contact plate ll4 provided on the lateral side of the elevator 12 will be in contact with the motor switch 116 to stop th S the motor 92 and the elevator 12 at once, and thus the frightened mouse in the elevator 12 will at once bump away the turfing plate and flee into the third hallway 24.By continu ing bumping away the turning plates 48, 50 as above described, the frightened mouse will flee into the inner room 52 and further fall into the confinement cell 58 in the lower compartment through the port 56 while bumping away the turning plate 5 set in said port 56. In the above last paragraphs description, before entering into the onner room 52, the mouse must inevitably touch the pedal switch 46 to switch 46 to switch on the motor 92, which belongs to the automatic control mechanisn 16 for the elevator 12, and the motor 60 which belongs to the automatic control mechanism 18 for the lifting plate 14.However, at this moment, due to the driven 64a engaging with the driving pulley 64b in the first cluiching pulley 64, the driven pulley 64a will therefore turn to roll up the steel wire 78 to lift up the lifting plate 14 by which the front entrance 28 of the first hallway will be opened.As soon as the contact plate 118 provided on tie lifting plate 14 is in contact with the motor switch 120 tie motor 60 and the lifting plate 14 will be immediabely stopped and said lifting plate 14 will then lay on the front side of the control rod 72. Meanwhile, because the tensive force on the froiit end of the lever 102 of the electricity switch 100, resulted from the connecting wire 106 of the liftiiig plate 11I, disappears, said front end of the lever 102 will shift upward to make the spring plate lO4 capable of contact with the upper spring plate 112. The motor 92 which belongs to the control mechanism for the elevator 12 will then operate and be caused to rotate the pulley 96 in a counterclockwise direction so as to lossen the steel wire 98 and lower the elevator 12. While lowering to its original position, the contact plate 114 provided on the lateral side of the elevator 12 will be in contact witli the motor switch 1.12 to stop the motor 92 and the elevator 12 immediately. Do such a performance., the animal trapping device of this invention will restore its function for an trapping animal once again. Therefore, this device may repeat its operating cycle all over again and catch lots of mice by automatic operating in continuity.
