# ROLLING MILL LAYING PIPE

## Abstract
A rolling mill laying pipe 12 has a rigid external tube 22 with an entry end 22a for receiving a longitudinaliy moving mill product and an exit end 22b through which the product 14 is discharged. An intermediate portion 22c of the tube be tween the entry and exit ends has a three dimensionally cur ved configuration. A helical spring 30 is axially received in and is radiaily confined by the tube. The spring is relatively tightly wound, with an inside diameter appropriately dimensioned to accommodate passage therethrough of the mill product. Re tainer elements 32, 34 are provided at the tube ends for axial ly confining the spring within the tube. At least one of the re tainer elements is detachable to permit removal and replace ment of the spring.
