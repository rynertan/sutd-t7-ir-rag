## Description
Title Method and Apparatus for the Narrow Gap Welding of thick tubes This invention relates to a method and apparatus for the welding of tubes and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for the narrow gap welding of thick, smallsized tubes or nozzles and thick, large sized tubes or shells. Pressure vessels obtained by welding nozzles to thick base tubes have conventionally been made, for example, by a system in which, as shown in Figure 1, a base tube 1 has a groove 3 formed in a circumferential edge of a junction port, and a nozzle 2 is set in the junction port and welded hereinafter referred to as a set in system .Another system which has been used is one as shown inFigure 2, in which the nozzle 2 is formed with the groove 3 and is butt welded in such a way as to be set on the junction port hereinafter referred to as a set on system .In welding in both systems, the junction face of the base tube 1 and nozzle 2 is taken as a weld line and they are welded approximately in a downhand position Figure 1 or in a horizontal position Figure 2 . The weld line formed in the set in or set on system assumes a so called saddle form, so that the height or vertical position of the weld line shown in the Figures continuously changes, with the angle of intersection which is established between the surface of the base tube 1 and the surface of the nozzle 2 also continuously changing as e, e w and the like. Accordingly, the V groove 3 shown in the Figures varies in sectional area along its circumference, lowering the stability of the welding operation. In Figure 3, there is shown an illustrative development in section, of Figure 1 showing the portions to be welded by the set in system. Angles w t 1of a portion C of the groove at the uppermost side of the saddle shaped weld line and a portion D at the undermost side thereof with respect to the vertical line, respectively, are designed and processed to be equal, with the section of the groove being made approximately equal. When designed in this manner, the width of the groove invariably becomes wider at the portion C of the groove indicated by e and narrower at the portion D of the grooveAccordingly, when a welding torch 5 is rotated concentrically with the nozzle 2, it is necessary to adjust the movement of the torch at every moment in the direction of X axis in order to cope with a variation of the width of the groove.The adjustment in the direction of theX axis as well as the adjustment in the direction of theY axis which must be invariably carried out produces a very serious problem in automating the welding. As a matter of fact, it may be possible to process the groove in such a way that the width of the groove is made uniform over the entire circumference thereof.However, this will involve not only a problem with respect to the accuracy of processing, but also a problem that even though the width of the groove along the entire circumference could be adjusted to make e the width of the portionD of the groove the angle of Vee w at the side D of the groove becomes greater than the angle of Vee at the side C of the groove see Figure 3 , so that the sectional area of the groove does not become constant along the circumference of the groove. Thus, the sectional area of groove is C D,so that the number of welding passes at the sides C and D must be changed. If the number of passes conforms to that required at the C side, an excess of weld metal becomes insufficient at the D side of the groove, leaving a defect at the junction.On the contrary, when the number of passes conforms to that of the D side, excess weld metal is formed in unnecessarily great amounts. In addition, the rise and fall tracing in the direction of Y axis has to be adjusted more finely.Thus, the set in system involves problems relating to the groove width and angle, making automatic welding difficult. Figure 4 is a sectional, illustrative development of Figure 2 showing portions to be welded by the set on system. When groove angles a and 1 at the upper sideE and lower side F of the saddle shaped weld line are made approximately equal, the groove widths h and hl are in such a relation that hChl and, consequently, the sectional area are such that ECF. Even though the torch 5 has been traced concentrically with the nozzle 2, the groove widths h and hl change greatly, so that the adjustment of the torch 5 in the direction of Y axis accompanied by the saddle shaped welding must be more finely conducted.Additionally, since the amount of molten metal varies over the entire circumference, control of the number of weld passes as described with reference to Figure 4 may be needed, which is very inconvenient. On the other hand, when the groove angle at the F side of the nozzle 2 is adjusted or reduced to so that the groove widths are h h , the sectional areas of the groove can be held almost constant. However, there is a risk that the groove angle at the F side may become so small that the weld penetration at the nozzle side will become insufficient for welding in the horizontal position. In contrast, when the angle at the F side is made great, it becomes fairly great, inviting a much greater lowering of the welding workability. In thick tubes of the type discussed herein, the depth of groove may reach about 100 mm and thus the groove section becomes large, so that the various problems described above are further emphasized, making automating the welding still more difficult.As for the type of automatic welding technique which should be applied to those portions discussed above, it is generally considered appropriate to make use of submerged arc welding or gas shielded arc welding. However, since the former technique requires keeping the sprayed flux on the weld line, it is applicable only to a case where the angle of inclination of the weld line is small, i.e. to a case where the ratio of the diameter of the nozzle to the diameter of the base tube is small. In the latter technique, there is a danger that in order to prevent the molten pool from flowing, multipass welding moulding using low electric current must be conducted, with the result that a lack of fusion will frequently occur. To avoid this, it is general to resort to manual or semi automatic welding made by skilled operators. Discussions of welding of the type described above are to be found in the material published by Asano et al of Babcock Hitachi Co. Ltd., on September 30, 1980 in the meeting of the Yosetsu Gakkai, the Collection ofPrearranged Manuscripts issued on March 8, 1980 , JWSNo. 26 spring, 1980 pp. 98 99, published by Kawahara etal of Babcock Hitachi Co., Ltd., in April 1980 in the meeting of the Yosetsu Gakkai, the report entitled Automatic Welding of Nozzles to Shells of MetalConstruction, September 1980, pp. 500 501, ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, pp. 82 83, and Japanese Laid OpenPublication No. 115647 1979. An object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for the narrow gap welding of, for example, nozzles to a pressure vessel in which automatic welding is accurately feasible along a weld line which changes in a complicated fashion in the form of a saddle. According to the present invention, there is provided a method for the narrow gap welding of thick tubes which comprises providing a thick, large sized tube laid approximately in a horiziontal direction, disposing a thick, small sized tube in such a manner as to be substantially intersected with said thick, large sized tube so that the small sized tube is jointed to said large sized tube and a gap established between the smallsized tube and said large sized tube has a narrow I form, welding the small sized and large sized tubes together approximately in a downhand position while moving a welding head, which is capable of being moved concentrically with said small sized tube, along the outer periphery of said small sized tube, and detecting an extension of a welding wire and controlling the vertical movement of the welding head so as to keep the extension substantially constant, whereby said thick, small sized tube can be automatically, reliably jointed to said thick, large sized tubes.

As described above the method of the present invention uses a set in technique to dispose a nozzle approximately in a vertical direction for joining with a thick base tube, the groove formed in the base tube is shaped to have a narrow I form, and a welding head which is capable of being rotated concentrically with and around the nozzle is moved along the outer periphery of the nozzle and is downhand welded, while detecting an extension of the welding wire and controlling the vertical movement of the welding head so as to keep the extension substantially constant. Referring now to Figures 5 and 6, there is shown an embodiment of the invention in which a nozzle is welded to a base tube according to the welding method of the invention. A base tube 1 laid approximately horizontally is jointed to a nozzle 2 which is dispoed in an intersecting direction with respect to the base tube 1, i.e.in a vertical direction. A groove 4a of narrow I form is formed around the junction port of the base tube 1 as shown. The groove 4a has a U shaped root 4b to prevent molten metal from burning through. If a backing material is used, the root may be removed to give a complete narrow I groove. The formation of the narrowI groove along the outer periphery of the nozzle 2 means that the circumference of the junction port of the base tube 1 is formed as the groove 4a which is parallel to the outer surface of the nozzle 2. This is very advantageous in that the edge preparation is simple with the working speed being improved, and in that the groove widths L at the upper side C and lower side D of the groove can be made equal.Accordingly, a torch which is concentrically moved along the nozzle 2 can be moved without being adjusted finely in the direction of theX axis as in the case of the V groove of Figure 1 while being adjusted only in the direction of the Y axis. The control of the torch which is traced vertically in the direction of the Y axis can be made by adjusting only the vertical movement of the weld line of the saddle form which can be mathematically dealt with and by adjusting the transfer portion of preceding beads which changes depending on the multi layer welding, thus being very suitable for automatic welding. When the narrow I groove is formed, as described above, by the set in system in the saddle shaped portion where the thick nozzle is jointed to the thick base tube, a tracing control substantially in the direction of theY axis alone is sufficient. Use of a welding apparatus having a detecting means capable of achieving such control permits automatic welding to be very easily carried out. The use of a detecting and controlling means and the use of a particular welding means does not, per se, limit the present invention but we have investigated and developed suitable means for automatic welding and illustrate the method and apparatus using such means. The automatic welding is suitably conducted when the welding current and wire feeding rate are detected at the time of arc generation and then the wire extension, i.e. the distance between the tip of the welding wire and the base metal or more precisely, wire extension distance between the tip and a base metal arc gap is controlled to hold it constant. The detection of the wire extension and the subsequent control of vertical movement of the welding wire are described below in detail. The wire feeding rate can be detected by taking out an amateur voltage of a wire feeding motor or a tacho generator voltage connected to the wire feeding motor.The welding current can be obtained by measuring the voltage of a shunt unit. It has been found that there is a relation between the wire feeding rate and welding current as shown in Figure 7. In Figure 7, the wire extensions L1, L2 and L3 provided that L1 L, L3 are taken as a parameter and a relation between the welding current and wire feeding rate is shown. When the wire feeding rate is taken as V and the welding current is taken as I, the following equation is given V klI k2 12 1 in which kl and k2 are proportional constants. The relation of these two variables is thus expressed by a secondary function and when an intersecting point between the secondary curve and the axis of welding current is taken as Io, the following equation is given V aI I Io 2 in which CL is a proportional constant depending on the wire extension. Accordingly, when the measured wire feeding rate V and welding current I are substituted into the equation 2 and both laterals or sides are compared with each other, it can be judged whether a set wire extension is longer L3 than, for example, L2 or shorter L1 . By controlling the vertical movement of the welding head so as to hold the wire extension constant based on these results of the above judgement, the tracing in the vertical directions of the saddle shaped weld line can be made very accurately. Then, when the amateur voltage or tachometer generator voltage is taken as VF and a voltage corresponding to the welding current from the shunt is taken as Vs, the relation between VF and Vs is shown in Figure 8 which is similar toFigure 7 in which the wire extension is also taken as a parameter. In this case, within appropriate ranges of the welding current and wire feeding rate which are determined according to the welding conditions such as sectional area of wire and welding position, both the variables can be approximated as a primary function which follows VF ss Vs Vo in which Vo is a maximum value of welding current at the time when the wire feeding rate is zero, and ss is a proportional constant determined by the wire extension. Figures 9 a and 9 b illustrate cases where the welding position varies in a downward or upward direction as the welding proceeds. Figure 9 a shows the welding position in the downward direction and Figure 9 b shows the position of the upward direction. Thus, when the torch 5 moves downwardly in the direction of arrow A, the wire extension becomes longer L4o L5 provided that the feeding rate of wire is constant, with the result that the resistance increases correspondingly to an increment in length of the wire and thus the shunt voltage Vs is lowered CVFZ ss Vs Vo .On the other hand, when the torch 5 moves in the direction of arrow B, i.e. in the upwardly inclined position, the wire extension becomes shorter L6 L7 , with the resistance value being reduced by an increment in length of the wire, the shunt voltageVs thus being lowered VF B Vs Vo . As will be appreciated from the above, the variation of the shunt voltage Vs is considered to result from the variation of the wire extension and thus it is sufficient to make an adjustment so as to return to a relationship of VF Vs Vo showing an optimum value of the wire extension, i.e. it is sufficient to keep the wire extension constant by descending the welding head for the former case and by ascending the welding head for the latter case.This control procedure is applicable to a method in which the wire feeding rate is controlled by feeding back either an arc voltage or welding current. By this control of the vertical movement, the vertical tracing is directed to the saddle shaped weld line itself and fine variations such as an overlying on preceding layers at the time of continuous, multi layer welding can be suitably traced. Figure 10 shows a welding apparatus suitable for carrying out the method of the invention. The welding apparatus generally indicated by W is mounted on the thick nozzle 2 and includes a swivel base 6, a swivelling shaft 10 and a welding head 9. The welding head 9 is disposed so that it can be rotated around the swivel shaft 10 having an axis of rotation which is coincident with the axis of the nozzle 2 and is moved along the outer periphery of the nozzle 2.The welding head 9 is connected to the swivel shaft 10 through a unit U having a bracket 18 fixed to the shaft 10, a screw shaft 19 supported by the bracket 18, a slider 12 mounted on the screw shaft 19 and capable of being moved in opposite horizontal directions along the screw shaft so as to regulate the radius of rotation of the welding head, and a slide arm 13 fixedly securing the welding head and capable of moving in a vertical direction so that the vertical position of the welding head can be controlled. Accordingly, when the screw shaft 19 is rotated by means of a drive motor 16, the slider 12 is moved horizontally in a direction depending on the direction of the rotation of the screw shaft, thereby adjusting the swivel radius of the welding head.A mounting. 11 of the slider 12 has fixed thereon a motor 17, by which the slide arm 13 which is vertically supported by the mounting 11 is vertically moved. The arm 13 has at its tip the welding head 9 having a welding wire 5 and a shielding gas nozzle 8. The head 9 is vertically moved according to the vertical movement of the arm 13, and the narrow I groove is subjected to successive multilayer welding using the welding wire 5. The drive motor 17 is driven on the basis of a signal from a control device 14 which serves to keep the wire extension constant. It will be noted that the swivel shaft 10 is rotated by means of a motor 7 through a pinion fixed to the output shaft of the motor 7 at one end and meshed with the gear of the swivel shaft 10 at the other end. It is also to be noted that the welding apparatus is not limited to that described above and any type of welding apparatus in which a welding head having a wire feeding mechanism and in which a vertically tracing device is swivelled concentrically with the central axis of the nozzle may be used and, for example, the head may be mounted to an elevating mechanism of the manipulator type. The welding wire used in the welding method according to the invention is preferably one which is formed by intertwisting a plurality of wires of the same diameter or simply two wires as shown in Figure 11. The arc from the intertwisted welding wire 15 as shown in the Figure is generated in a direction vertical to the cross section of the individual strand wires, i.e. it is generated while rotating in such a manner as to spread toward the outside from the central axis of the wire feeding direction.Accordingly, the molten metal beneath the arc is forced toward the groove sides. This ensures good fusion in the groove sides, coupled with another advantage that since the molten metal is supported by the groove sides by the rapid quenching effect and surface tension, defects rarely occur even in inclined welding positions.For instance, where the diameter of the nozzle 2 is half the diameter of the base tube 1, the maximum angle of inclination of the saddle shaped weld line is about 150. In such an inclined position, it is virtually impossible to weld without defect in a conventional process, but very excellent welding results can be obtained according to this invention. The gas shielding nozzle for the I shaped narrow grooved gas shielded arc welding could be either a box type or insertion type gas shielding nozzle according to the groove depth. A box type gas shielding nozzle is used where the groove depth is less than about 50 mm groove depth, is located on the surface of the members to be welded, and feeds shielding gas to the inside of the welding groove. Figure 14 is a schematic view of box type gas shielding nozzle. An insertion type gas shielding nozzle is used where the groove depth is more than 50 80 mm, is located in the welding groove and parallel to the welding torch, and feeds shielding gas to the melting welding metal. Figure 15 is a schematic view of an insertion type gas shielding nozzle. Another embodiment of the invention will now be described. Figure 12 a is a sectional view showing a case where the narrow groove of I form has a depth of at least 50 mm and a gas shielding nozzle of the insertion type is used in the method of the invention. Prior to commencement of the welding, a groove forming auxiliary jig 23 is placed at the side of the nozzle insertion of the I shaped narrow groove 3. The jig 23 is made, for example, of metallic plates with a height of about 50 mm. In the embodiment shown in the Figure a an exterior ring 23a is placed at the side of the large sized tube 1 and an interior ring 23b is placed at the side of the small sized tube 2. These rings 23a, 23b have such bottom faces along the face of the base tube and are so formed as to have the same height width over the entirity thereof or to have the same height width when the height in vertical direction of the groove and the height in the vertical direction of the jig are added. In addition, a backing member 20 is provided below the groove 3 as shown. Where the weld line is in saddle form as shown in the Figures, it is possible to bring the lower faces of the rings 23a and 23b into intimate contact with the surface of the members to be welded and make the top faces flat.The gap established between the inner surface of the exteriornng 23a and the outer surface of the interior ring 23b is made quail to or slightly wider than a gap between the outer and inner walls of the I shaped narrow groove thereby forming a temporary auxiliary groove 24.Figure 12 b is a side view of Figure 12 a but partially broken away to show more clearly the state of mounting of the auxiliary jig. It is recommended that the auxiliary jig 23 for the temporary auxiliary groove is made of a metallic plate 1 to 12 mm thick which is relatively easy to bend and has a suitable rigidity and is preferably made of a steel material of the same type as the materials to be welded.On mounting, the jig is temporarily welded so that the jig is brought to intimate contact with the surface of the members to be welded so that no gap is formed between the surfaces of the members and the lower face of the jig 23, or is sealed by a filler or an adhesive tape, thereby preventing air from flowing in upon gas gushing from the shielding nozzle of the insertion type set in the groove and also preventing the gas from releasing on welding of the upper surface of the groove. By this, the narrow groove 3 can be welded from the bottom to the upper face by using the insertion type shielding nozzle as it is. For instance, even when the insertion type shielding nozzle rises near the upper face of the groove 3, it is positioned within the temporary auxiliary groove 24, so that the shielding gas can be effectively used, making it unnecessary to go to the trouble of exchanging with a box type shielding nozzle. Figure 13 shows a case where the auxiliary jig 23 is disposed in the large sized tube 1. The auxiliary jig 23 is located at the side of the nozzle insertion of the I shaped narrow groove. Where the welding is conducted using the auxiliary jig 23 for forming a temporary groove, the welding is stopped when the welding beads are stacked near the upper face of the narrow groove on which the auxiliary jig is mounted. Subsequently, the auxiliary jig is removed, for example, by gas cutting, and the cut portion is finished by grinding or repair welding on the bead surface. In this embodiment, the gas shielding arc welding is effected using an auxiliary jig for the groove such as described above, so that it is possible to continuously weld the whole groove by the use of an insertion type shielding nozzle alone, thereby improving the welding efficiency greatly. The present invention, or at least embodiments thereof, has the following advantages i By forming the saddle shaped weld line, which changes in a complicated fashion, as a narrow I groove, automatic multi pass welding is possible by controlling only the tracing in vertical directions.ii Since the sectional area of the groove does not change, continuous welding in a constant welding state can be achieved.iii Where the vertical tracing control is conducted by detection of the extension of wire, there can be obtained a very reliable and excellent joint though the control is simple.iv A skilled welder is not required.
