# MOORING ARRANGEMENT.

## Abstract
A mooring arrangement comprises a mooring line 1 a bitt engaging unit 2 mounted at one end of the mooring line 1 a mooring winch 3 connected to the other end of the mooring line 1 a lifting line 4 for holding and lifting the bitt engaging unit 2 and a crane 5 connected to the lifting line 4 . At the time of mooring, the crane 5 is swiveled toward a bitt or bollard on a ship or quay to which the ship concerned is to be moored, and the lifting line 4 is rewound, whereby the bitt engaging unit 2 is retained by the bitt or bollard. Then, tension is applied to the mooring line 1 by the action of the mooring winch 3 , thereby completing the mooring operation. When the ship leaves the ship or quay to which it has been moored, the above described operation procedure is reversed. The above described mechanical operation of the apparatus makes it possible to automate as well as rationalize the mooring operation and to improve safety.
