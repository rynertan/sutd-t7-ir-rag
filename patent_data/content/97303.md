# Removal of hydrogen sulfide from fluid streams with minimum production of solids.

## Abstract
Fluid streams containing hydrogen sulfide from a steam turbine or from a sour gas stream are contacted with an aqueous solution of a polyvalent metal chelate and an oxidizing agent whereby the hydrogen sulfide is concerted to free sulfur and then to soluble sulfur compounds. The metal chelate is reduced to a lower oxidation state metal chelate and reduced metal chelate is subsequently oxidized with air back to the higher oxidation state and reused.
