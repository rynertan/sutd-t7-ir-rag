# Electrophotographic printer.

## Abstract
Compound copied image 41a and printed character image 41b on a printing medium 41 . A printer comprises copying exposure system 6, 7, 8 for the first electrostatic latent image 1 by the exposure of the medium to an image in a certain area of a copy text through an electrically controlled optical switch, and a printing exposure system 11, 31, 34, 35, 36, 37 for the second electrostatic latent image by the exposure of the printing medium to a scanning laser beam which is modulated by a laser beam generator 12 in accordance with literal information to be printed. In order that the first and second latent image do not interfere with each other, a main sequence controller 29 provides positional sync signals information on the positional rela tions between the exposure systems and the drum is produced therefrom a composing sequence controller 30 controls the optical switch 7, 8 and laser beam scanner 11 in accordance with a composition buffer 33 storing frame composing information.
