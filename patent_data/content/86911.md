# Molded resin product and process for producing same.

## Abstract
Novel, 1,2 epoxy resin products using unique polycyclic, aromatic, polycarboxylic acid products as cross linking agents display satisfactory electrical properties and good Barcol hardness values. The process for preparing these novel resin products involves admixing a 1,2 epoxy resin containing on the average more than one 1,2 epoxy groups per molecule and the acid product derived from the nitric acid oxidation of naturally occurring solid carbonaceous material along with a suitable accelerator. The mixture is then subjected to a precure step which involves heating at temperatures between 50 and 150 C for from about five minutes to about six hours. The mixture is thereafter subjected to suitable molding conditions.
