## Description
PROCESS FOR THE DOUBLE BOND ISOMERIZATION OF OLEFINS This invention relates to a process for the double bond isomerization of olefins utilizing a chromium sulphate supported catalyst. Isomerization of an olefin can comprise either a skeletal rearrangement and or a double bond shift. There are commercial processes wherein a double bond shift of, for example, an alphaolefine provides a very useful feedstock for other processes such as, for example, an alkylation process or a disproportionation process. U.S. patent specification 3,301,916 discloses the use of an anhydrous chromium sulphate supported catalyst for Isomerizing olefins containing for example 4 6 carbon atoms. The isomerization comprises both double bond shift and skeletal rearrangement. It has now been found that catalysts comprising a partially hydrated chromium sulphate supported on a porous inert siliceous support are highly selective towards double bond shift isomerization and cause onl .inima sieieeal rearrangement. According to the Invention there is provided a process for the doubie bond isomeration of olefins in which one or more olefins are contacted under isomerization conditions with a catalyst comprising chromium sulphate on a porous inert siliceous support, characterized in that the catalyst contains a partially hydrated chromium sulphate. Suitable porous inert siliceous supports are those typically utilized as catalyst supports in the industry. Preferred supports are for example silica and kieselguhr. The porous silicas which may be used to prepare the catalyst are readily available commercially and are known as silica gels which are essentially substantially dehydrated amorphous silica.These materials are available in various density grades, from low density with surface areas ranging from 100 200 m2 g, to regular density with surface areas up to 800 m2 g. These com mercially available materials are used as desiccants, selective adsorbents. catalysts and catalyst supports. The porous silica may contain minor proportions of other materials such as for example alumina and carbon. Kieselguhr and diatomaceous earths are readily available commercially and make excellent supports for the catalysts used according to the invention. Examples of commercially available silica gels and their properties are shown in the table below.Sunoort Surface Pore Densi Parti area, vol., ty cle m2 g ml g g ml sizeDavison 300 1.65 0.35 70 mesh avg.

To prepare the catalyst used in the process according to the invention, the porous support is impregnated with an aqueous solution of chromium sulphate, dried, for example, at temperatures up to 1200C, and subsequently heated to a temperature ranging from 1200C to 240 C preferably from 140 C to 1900C. The drying and heating step may be carried out in one single sequence through a programmed temperature drying process. This final heating step will leave a molar ratio of H2O Cr metal in the catalyst ranging from 0.7 to 1.1, preferably from 0.8 to 1.0.This final heating step is critical. Heating the material to higher temperatures say 350 C and higher substantially dehydrates the chromium sulphate. The impregnation may be a single step impregnation, preferably a so called dry impregnation wherein only that amount of aqueous solution is utilized which just fills the voids in the catalyst support. Alternatively, the catalyst may be impregnated several times to provide different levels of chromium sulphate. The final catalyst will contain 0.1 to 25, preferably 1 to 10 percent by weight of chromium measured as the metal. The isomerization process is carried out by contacting the catalyst with the appropriate olefin or mixture of olefins uner isomerization conditions. The exact conditions will depend upon the particular olefin or olefins being isomerized and these conditions can readily be determined by routine experimentation.In general, isomerization conditions would encompass temperatures in the range of 50 C to 500 C, preferably from 500C to 3500 C, and most preferably from 50 C to 2000 C, and pressures ranging from sub atmospheric to super atmospheric, for example ranging from 0.i atmosphere to l00 atmospheres, although other pressures can readily be ui1izec. The isoner zation can e performed as either a batch, continuous or a semi continuous process.A fixed, moving or fluidized catalyst bed may be employed and the contacting of the catalyst with the hydrocarbons may performed either in the presence of or the absence from a diluent that is substantially inert with respect to the catalyst under conditions employed. The feedstock to the process may be any olefin capable of isomerization, preferred olefins are, however, alpha olefins.These may be either lower molecular weight olefins ranging from for example, C4 to C6, or the higher range olefins ranging from for example C6 to C50. Preferably, the process is carried out with a hydrocarbon liquid hourly space velocity in the range of 0.1 to 10 when utilizing a fixed bed configuration. The process of the invention will be further described below the the following Examples.EXAMPLE 1Catalyst preparation A porous silica gel Davison Grade 57, surface area 300 m2 g, pore volume 1.0 ml g, density 0.4 g ml, and particle size 20 30 mesh 0.59 0.84 mm is pretrated in dry nitrogen at 600 C for 2 hours. To 12 grams of this dried material is added a solution of 4.12 grams of Cr2 S04 3. 12H20 dissolved in 15 millilitres of water. After impregnation the material is dried with a hot air gun and then further dried at 125 C for 1 hour in a muffled furnace. The catalyst subsequently activated at the appropriate temperature in situ in the olefin isomerization reactor. Isozerization process The procedure for catalyst testing consists of mixing 2.5 grams of the catalyst as prepared above with 2.5 grams of Davison 57 SiO2 and placing this in a glass reactor tube 15 mm diameter . The remaining space in the reactor tube above the catalyst bed is filled with Davison 57 SiO2 approximately 5 grams . The tube is placed in a furnace, and the catalyst is act sated by heating it under รก stream of nItrogen where i passes down through the bed. The olefin is pumped in a down flow mode through the bed at a predetermined temperature. With the use of higher molecular weight olefins, parts of the pumping system are heated to approximately 70 C in order to prevent plugging of the lines. During all operations a slow nitrogen or argon flow is maintained over the feed and throughout the flow system. Catalysts are also prepared using Kaiser KA201 alumina surface area 365 m2 g, pore volume 0.42 ml g comparative experiment , and Davison silica alumina grade 980 25, 75 si ia 54 alumina, surface area 325 m2 g, pore volume 0.45 ml g . The catalysts are prepared to have a final weight of chromium sulphate of 2.1 basis chromium metal. Silica supported catalysts are activated at either 1500C or 350 C. At 1500C the catalysts contain approximately 1.9 weight of water H20 Cr ratio of approximately 0.9 . The catalyst activated at 3500C contains substantially no water. The isomerization reactor is heated to the reaction temperature specified in Table 1 and hexene is pumped into the reactor at the weight hour space velocity given in Table 1. The products are analysed by gas chromatography and the results are shown in Table 1. As can be seen the catalyst that is activated at 1500C is far more active than the substantially anhydrous catalyst activated at 3500 C. The former catalyst even when operated at twice the weight hourly space velocity of hexene provides much more of the isonerized product than does the substantially anhydrous catalyst. The chromium sulphate supported on alumina provides substantially no isomerization under the conditions of this example.

The reaction is carried out at various temperatures indicated in Table 3 and the results of these experiments are also shown in Table 3.

To determine skeletal isomerization, samples of the above 13 isomerized olefins are analyzed by C NMR.THE BASIS 01 THIS analysis is to use the ratio of integrals from methyl group carbons IC CH3 and also those from the total carbon atoms Ic total and to relate these to the percentage of molecules with branches. An increase in this ratio with isomerization would indicate an increase in skeletal isomerization. The results are shown in Table 4. It can be seen from this table that no significant skeletal isomerization occurs.
