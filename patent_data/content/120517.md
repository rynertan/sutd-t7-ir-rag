# Burner and process for the partial combustion of solid fuel.

## Abstract
A burner of the reactor mix type for the partial combus tion of a finely divided solid fuel in a combustion zone, com prising a central channel 11 for finely divided solid fuel, an annular channel 12 for free oxygen containing gas, substan tially concentrically surrounding the central channel 11 , said annular channel 12 being provided with primary, inclined outlet means 14 for directing high velocity free oxygen con taining gas into the outflowing solid fuel during operation and secondary outlet means 13 around the primary outlet means for conveying shielding low velocity free oxygen containing gas to the combustion zone. The invention further relates to a process for the partial combustion of a finely divided solid fuel, wherein one or more burners of the above type are applied.
