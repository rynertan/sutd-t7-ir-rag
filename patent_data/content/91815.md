# Static type semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A static type semiconductor memory device includes a memory block comprising an array MCA of memory cells MC , holding current supply circuitry for supplying holding current to the memory cells, and auxiliary circuitry including memory cell read circuitry SA, etc. . Means HC are included for increasing the holding current and decreasing load current supplied to the auxiliary circuitry, which means operate in response to a predetermined signal indicating that the memory block is not presently selected for use. Such means can protect against loss of stored data without increasing unacceptably the total current supplied to the device.
