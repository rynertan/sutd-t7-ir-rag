# Stirrer, having substantially triangular, radial blades, rising towards the circumference.

## Abstract
Stirrer, comprising a spindle 1 provided with a drive, to which spindle a disc or plate 2 is affixed, cut into star shape and extending perpendicular to the axis. to which, on one or both sides of said disc or plate, a plurality of stirring blades 4 is affixed, lying substan tially in radially directed axial planes, and having the form of substantially right angled triangles having the longer base directed radially and the shorter perpendi cular, parallel to the axis, lying as the extreme edge at the greatest distance from the axis, where moreover the number of stirring blades on one disc side amounts to at least 8, the height h of the extreme blade edge is equal to 0.5 to 2 times the perpendicular distance a of the extreme end of one blade to the successive blade, and the length L of the blades, measured along their hypothenuse, amounts to at least twice the height h thereof. Preferably the number of blades on one disc side amounts to 12 or even 18. It is advantageous when the height h of the ex treme edge of the blades amounts to 0.8 to 1.25 times the said perpendicular distance a , and when the height h of the extreme edge of the blades is substantially equal to the said perpendicular distance a . The plane of the blades need not be exactly in a radial plane but may be bent or slightly inclined in radial direction, forwardly or rearwardly relative to the sense of rotation, or it may be slightly inclined in ver tical direction perpendicular to the disc, forwardly or rearwardly relative to the sense of rotation. The invention also envisages a centrifugal impeller of the type treminating into a narrow circumferential slit through which, during rotation, the fluid supplied leaves the impeller such impeller 14 is provided with stirring blades 17 of the above mentioned type.
