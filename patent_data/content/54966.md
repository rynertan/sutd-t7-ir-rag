# Refrigerant compressor.

## Abstract
A refrigerant compressor for use in refrigerators, air conditioners, heat pumps or the like apparatus. The refrigerant pump has a casing which encases a combi nation of a compressor and an electric motor. A spring guide has an attaching base portion fixed to a bearing supporting a crank shaft driven by the motor, and an oil pipe connected to the attaching base such that the inside of the oil pipe opens to one end of the crank shaft. The oil pipe is bent so that the free end thereof is immersed in the lubricating oil in the case. The oil pipe receives a coiled spring which is fixed at its one end to the end of the crank shaft while the other end is immersed in the lubricating oil. As the compressor operates, the coiled spring rotates in the oil pipe so that the lubricat ing oil is sucked by the lead of the coiled spring through the gap formed between the inner peripheral surface of the oil pipe and the coiled spring.
