# Alkali metal salts of cross linked polymeric microgels as nucleating agents for polyethylene terephthalate moulding compositions.

## Abstract
Nucleating agents for polyethylene terephthalate mould ing compositions comprise alkali metal salts of carboxylic acid containing polymeric microgel particles which are pre pared by polymerising in aqueous emulsion a monomer mixture containing about 5 to 50 percent by weight of polymerisable carboxylic acid monomers, up to 10 percent of a multifunctional cross linking monomer and one or more carboxyl free relatively water insoluble polymerisable vinyl monomers.
