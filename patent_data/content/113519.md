# Portable machine tool.

## Abstract
A portable machine tool, comprising a base structure 11 , a work surface 12 supported by the base structure 11 for supporting, in use, a workpiece, and a column 13 pivotally connected to the base structure 11 and being pivotal between an upstanding operative position in which the column 13 extends upwardly above the work surface and a lateral inoperative position. An operating unit 15 is attached to the column 13 and is supported thereby above the work surface 12 in the operative upstanding position for operating, in use, on the workpiece. A locking arrangement, 37,40 26,43 releasably secures the column 13 in the operative upstanding position. Preferably the column 13 is pivoted behind and to the rear of the base structure 11 , and a part 30a, b, c of the work surface 12 is removable to expose a space 56 inside the base structure 11 in which the operating unit 15 is at least partially housed when the column 13 is pivoted to the inoperative lateral position. In this way the machine tool, which is preferably a radial arm saw, is made more compact for transporting and or storage.
