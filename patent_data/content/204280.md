# Ski boot structure.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a ski boot 1, 2 provided with self powered electric and or electronic devices. The surface of the boot is covered by a plurality of solar cells 3,4 , which convert the solar radiation into electric energy which acts to integrate a series of storage batteries 10 contained in a box type body rigidly attached, in a preferably removable manner, with the footwear structure. The series of storage batteries 10 may be recharged by normal external sources of electric energy, while the solar cells 3, 4 have the function of integrating the charge allowing a longer opera tion of the devices. The electric devices are of the resistive controlled type 13 , for heating the footwear while those electronic consist of means for controlling 16 the correct closure of the boot and or means for control of the efforts to which the limb of the skier is subjected during use. Such control devices may conveniently cooperate with safety means provided in the ski to determine opening of the safety bindings in case of dangerous overloads.
