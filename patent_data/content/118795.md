# Method for producing a nondirectional pen.

## Abstract
A method for producing a nondirectional pen includes the steps of drawing a metal pipe 10 to form a pen blank having three or more radial blade sections 1 extending along the length of the pen blank and equally spaced angularly away from one another, each of the radial blade sections 1 including an internal gap 11 extending along the length of that blade section, cutting the pen blank into pen bodies having a predetermined length shaping the forward end of each of the pen bodies into a substantially conical configuration slotting the pen body from its tip to form longitudinal slots 14 each aligning with the internal gap of the corresponding radial blade section and providing a hard pen point 3 capable of writing.
