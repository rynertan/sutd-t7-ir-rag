# GAS MONITORING EQUIPMENT

## Abstract
Equipment for monitoring the concentration of com ponents in a gas flow has two probes 1,2 located at 63 in the gas flow. Sample gas is drawn through the probes and through pipes 3,4 by a pump 8 , and test samples are extra cted from the pipes by pumps 11,12 and fed to an analysis line 10 . The probes 1,2 work alternately, and, when one is not working, it may be cleaned by blowing air through from a source 9 , while the corresponding one of the pipes 3,4 is blocked from the line 10 by valves 13 16 .
