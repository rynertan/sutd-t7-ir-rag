# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR COATING DETECTION AND SURFACE EVALUATION

## Abstract
A primary beam of light is directed against the surface of a piece of material under conditions predetermined to generate a secondary beam by either transmission through the piece or reflection from the surface thereof. The second ary beam is directed against means for measuring the in tensity of the transmitted or reflected light and the light in tensity measured. The procedure is repeated on a different surface of the piece and the results compared. This gives an evaluation of the surface and a determination of the pre sence, absence, or condition of any coating which may be present on the surface. The apparatus of the invention com prises means for achieving the foregoing functions. The methode and apparatus are of particular appli cation in the determination of which is the coated side of an object, such as a photographic film, or a coated lens.
