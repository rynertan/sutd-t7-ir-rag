# Passive fiber optic multiplexer.

## Abstract
A passive, frequency selective, fiber optic multiplexer comprises a directional coupler 10 in which a pair of single mode optical fibers 12a, 12b are accurately positioned to provide evanescent field coupling, typically by polishing a portion of the cladding 17a, 17b from each of the fibers 12a, 12b to place the respective cores 15a, 15b of the fibers 12a, 12b within the evanescent field of light in the other fiber 12a, 12b . The coupling efficiency of a coupler 10 constructed in this manner is wavelength dependent, and provides over coupling, that is, the capability of transfer ring light, virtually entirely, back and forth between the fibers 12a, 12b within the coupler 10 . The wavelength dependent nature of the evanescent field coupling permits multiplexing, specifically between a pair of wavelengths, one of which is coupled in its entirety from a first fiber 12a to a second fiber 12b , and the other of which is essentially uncoupled. By increasing the number of total transfers of the light signals between the pair of fibers 12a, 12b , the frequency resolu tion of the multiplexer may be optimized for light signals of virtually any frequency separation.
