## Description
Wire deployinq apparatus. This invention relates in general to the wire handling art and in particular to wire deploying apparatus. Wo have described for example in our United States Patent Specification No. 3,891,013, wire deploying apparatus comprising a templet having a wire supporting working surface in which are formed a plurality of juxtaposed, elongate wire deploying recesses, and a wire pressi member arranged to be moved in a given direction across he wire supporting surface, longitudinally of the recesses and towards one end thereof, to press wires extendinc between the supporting surface and the pressing member info the recesses. It.s sometimes the case that the wires are not disposed is orderly mutual relationship on the templet, for example as a result of a cable, of which the wires initially formed part, having been bent. Also, the wires may no correctly align themselves with the recesses if the wires the of very small gauge or are very stiff.The invention is primarily directed to the problem of properly orienting the wires, in such case, to allow each wire to be pressed into its correct recess by the pressing member, so that the danger of the wires being severed between the presing member and the edges of the recesses is avoided. The invention proceeds from the realization that each wire can be ade to align itself with its corresponding recess by causing he wire to be tensioned slightly prior to its engagement , the wire pressing member. According to the invention therefore, wire deploying apparatus as defined in the second paragraph of this specification are characterised by a wire controller member movable across the supporting surface in the given direction in unison with, and in advance of, the pressing member irl juxtaposed but spaced relationship thereto, tlie controlle member presenting a wire deflecting surface positioned above the wire supporting surface, to deflect parts of the wires, which are adjacent to the pressing member, away from the supporting surface so as to align each such part with a recess. Apart from affording a solution to the problem outlined above, the invention has the further advantage that the wire controller member can be arranged to co operate, as described in detail below, with the wire pressing member to untwist portions of the wires where these are arranged, as is usual for example in the telephone industry, as twisted pairs of wires, the recesses being formed with branches each for receiving an untwisted wire portion. Apparatus according to the invention can conveniently be provided with means for inserting the deployed wires into wire receiving portions, usually in the form of slotted plates, of electrical terminals, the deployment of the wires being such as to separate them in conformity with the spacing between the terminals. The general state of the.art at this time is also exemplified by the following United States PatentSpecifications, 3,881,246, 3,939,933, 4,043,017, 3,739,818 and 3,779,290. For a better understanding of the invention two embodiments thereof will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of apparatus, according to a first embodiment of the invention, for deploying electrical wires and being provided with means for inserting the deployed wires into wire receiving portions of electrical terminals of an electrical connector, the parts of the apparatus being shown as positioned at the beginning of a cycle of operation the apparatus Figure 2 is a perspective view of an electrical connector for use with the apparatus Figure 3 is a plan view of a wire deploying templet of the apparatus Figure 4 is a sectional view taken along the linesIV IV of Figure 3 Figures 5 and 6 are views similar to Figure 4 but showing the positions of the parts during respective successive stages during the cycle of operation Figure 7 is an exploded, fragmentary, perspective view showing a portion of the templet and a wire controller member of the apparatus Figure 8 is a fragmentary vertical section with parts shown in phantom form, illustrating wire insertion tooling of the apparatus, and actuating means for such tooling Figure 9 is a perspective view of wire deploying apparatus, according to a second embodiment of the invention the parts of the apparatus being shown in their positions at the beginning of an operating cycle of the apparatus Figure 10 is a view similar to that of Figure 9 but showing the positions of the parts at a subsequent stage of the perating cycle iigure 11 is a diagrammatic side view showing the positions of the principle parts of the apparatus ofFigures 9 and 10 at the beginning of the operating cycle Figures 12 and 13 are views similar to that ofFigure 11 but showing the positions of the parts at respective successive. stages of the operating cycle and Figure 14 is a perspective view of an end portion of an electrical cable comprising four twisted pairs of wires for deployment by means of the apparatus of Figures 9 to 14. Apparatus according to the first embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to Figures 1 to 8. The apparatus is arranged to deploy, by Spreading apart, a plurality of wires and is provided with means for locating end portions of the wires in alignment with wire receiving portions of electrical terminals cE an electrical connector which is generally referenced 6, and which, is best seen in Figure 2. Since the connector 6 is described in detail in our United States PatentSpecification No. 3,760,335 it will be described .ere only to an extent necessary for an understanding of the apparatus.The wire receiving portions of the terminals not shown are in the form of slotted plates into the slots of which insulated wires 2 can be forced, to connect the electrically conductive cores of the wires to tle terminals. The terminals are disposed in a row in spaced compartments 4, in an insulating housing 3 st. the connector 6, the row extending transversely betweei the ends of the housing 3 and the compartments 4 being defined by barrier walls 7 spaced from a peripheral flange 9 which extends about the housing 3 between its forward face 11 and its rearward face 13, the face 11 havin a channel 5 to receive a plug portion of a mating elektrical connector not shown . The connector 6 has a further and similar row of compartments containing terminal. opposite to that described above, and which is not shown As shown in Figure 1, apparatus comprises a manually operated bench press having a press frame consisting of a vertical neck portion 10, a horizontal arm 12 and a base 14. A ram 16 slidably received in the arm 12 is movable towards and away from the base 14 by means of a handle 18 coupled to a shaft 20 extending transversely through the frame, and an end portion of which is shown in Figure 1.When the handle 18 is swung through a clockwise as seen in Figure 1 arc, the shaft 20 is rotated in a clockwise as seen in Figure 1 sense, so that a gear wheel not shown keyed to the shaft 20 and contained in the arm 12 meshes with a rack bar not should on the ram 16 to depress the ram 16 through a work .ng stroke. A bench press of this general type is described in detail in our United States PatentSpecification No. 4,013,017. A rectangular mounting plate 21 clamped to the base 14 by neans of clamping blocks 22 slidably carries a support block 24, which in turn carries a templet 26 in the form of a flat plate having a wire supporting working surface 27 facing the arm 12. The templet 26 has, as best seen is Figure 3, a plurality of wire receiving, elongate recess formed in the working surface 27 and having paralle. portions 28 extending from the outer end 30 of the , emplet 26 towards its inner end 32, and portions 34 whith diverge, intermediate the ends 30 and 32, towards the end 32. The portions 34 are spaced from one another at the end 32 by distances corresponding to the spacing between the compartments 4 of the connector housin 3 i.e. to the terminal spacing.As best seen in Figure 4, the inner end 32 of the templet 26 is spaced from the inner end face 39 of the templet support block 24, a w of spaced barriers 40 see Figure 1 extending from a hamfered surface 38 of the block 24 and having parts is projecting inwardly beyond the end face 39. Each barrier is has an undercut edge 41 facing the end 32 of the templet 26, to define, in co operation therewith, a notch 36. The spacing between adjacent barriers 40 is the same as th maximum spacing between tho portions 34 of the wire receiving resesses of the templet 26, at the end 32 thereof, so that parts of wires disposed in the portions 84 will also be received between adjacent barriers 40. The individual wires 2 are arranged to be pressed into the portions 28 and 34 of the recesses in the templet 26 b a wire pressing member in the form of a bar shaped roller 44 which in its position of Figure 4 is spaced above the portions 28. The roller 44 has reduced diameter ends 48 received in the arms 46 of a yoke 50 on the lower as seen in Figure 1 end of a lever 52 extending from the interior of the arm 12 of the press frame. The upper end of the lever 52 is coupled by means not shown to the lower end of the ram 16 in a manner described in United States Patent Specification No.4,043,017, the coupling being such that as the ram 16 is depressed from the position of Figure 1, the roller 44 descends until it abuts the templet 26 whereas upon further downward movement of the ram 16, the lever 52 swings through a clockwise arc as seen in Figure 1 so that the roller 44 seeps across the surface of the templet 26 as shown in Figures 5 and 6 in the longitudinal direction of the recesses 28, 34. These movements of the roller 44 during the.working stroke of the ram are achieved by means of a can type coupling not shown between the upper end of the lever 52 and the ram 16. A wire controller assembly 53, comprises as shown in Figure 7, a wire controller member in the form of a circular cross section cylindrical bar 54 of much smaller diameter than the roller 54. The bar 54 is arranged to sweep across the surface of the templet 26 in advance of the roller 44, that is to say, between the roller 44 and the inner end 32 of the templet 26, and in the longitudinal direction of the recesses 28, 34. The ends of the bar 54 are mounted preferably rotatably in a carrier in the fcrm of spaced carriage blocks 56 which are disposed against, the sides of the block 24 as best scen in Figure 1.The bar 54 presents a wire deflecting surface 54 which is positioned above the working surface 27. notches 58 in the upwardly facing surfaces of the blocks 56 are dimensioned to receive end portions of the roller 44 as shown in Figure 5 so that the assembly 53 is carried alone with the roller 44. Pivot pins 60 on the inner face 59 of the blocks 56 are received in guide channels 62 defined between overhanging lateral edge portions 61 of the templet 26, and ledges 63 on the sides of the bloti 24, as shown in Figure 7. The channels 62 have inner ends 64 spaced from the inner end face 39 of the bloc 24 to limit the leftward as seen in Figures 4 to 6 travel of the pins 60 and thus of the bar 54.As show. in Figure 5, when the end portions of the roller 44 are received in the notches 58, such end portions bear against the left hand edges of the notches 58 so that .e controller assembly 53 is moved by the roller 44 from the position of Figure 5 towards that of Figure 6. Whe the eins 60 reach the ends 64 of the channels 62, the conti. iing movement of the roller 44 imparts a moment to the controller assembly 53 so that the entire assembly 5. swings is an anticlockwise as seen in Figures 5 and 6 sense about the pivot pins 60, whereby the bar 54 drops into the not es 36 and the roller 44 continues its leftward movment, as shown in Figure 6. The operation of the parts described above will now be described in detail with particular reference toFigures 4 to 6. At the beginning of an operating cycle of the apparatus the parts thereof are positioned as shown in Figures and 4. The operator places the wires 2, as shown in Figure 4, so as to extend between the working surface 27 of the templet 26 and the roller 44, the wires projecting beyond the inner end 32 of the templet 26 and past a connector 6 positioned in connector locating means described below.The operator swings the handle 18 through its clockwise arc to cause the ram 16 to descend to lower the roller 44 to its vertical position of Figure 5 in abutment with the working surface 27 of the templet 26, whereby the wires 2 are pressed against such surface and the end portions of the roller 44 engage in the notches 58. Upon further downward movement of the press ram 16, the roller 44 is caused to advance from the position of Figure 5 to that of Figure 6, the roller 44 carrying with it for part of its advance movement, the assembly 53.The assembly 53 advances along the templet 26 and the support block 24 until the pins 60 abut the inner ends 64 of the channels 62 at which time, the bar 54 drops into the notches 36 as described above, and the roller 44 continues its advance until it is superposed with the upper edges of the barriers 40 as shown in Figure 6. During such movement of the rollers 44, the wires 2 are pressed into the recesses 28, 34 in accordance with the teaching of our United StatesPatent Specification No. 3,891,0J3. During the said part of the advance of the roller 44 from the position of Figure i towards that of Figure 6, the wires extend from beneati the roller 44 over the wire deflecting surface 54 of she bar 54, the parts 2 of.each wire 2 which lie between the bar 54 and the roller 44 being lifted by the surface 54 , as shown in Figure 5, above the working surface 27 t,f the templet 26. During the advance of the assembly .53, the bar 54 maintains the parts 2 of the wires 2 above the working surface 27 and approximately aligns each part 2 with the recess in the templet 26 into which it is so be pressed by the roller 44.Specifically, the bar 4, in lifting the wires 2, tends to flex parts 2 of the wires 2 so that the parts 2 are siresse samewhat, and have a tendency to return towards the working sun face 27. In other words the parts 2 are resiliently biased downwardly as seen inFigure 5. Also, the wires tend to locate themselves in jextappend relationship in the vicinity of the bar 54 and the roller 44 so that the wires are thereby dresed, so as to be in approximate alignement with the recesses of the templet 26, particularly while the roller 44 and the bar 54 are moving acrose the parallel portions 28 of these recesses, such effect continuing as the roller 44 and the bar 54 move across the divergent portions 34 of the recesses. Misplacing of the wives is thereby avoided. When the wires 2 are initialy in orderly mutual relationship, the roller 44 serves to ensure proper placing of the wires 2 in the recesses 28, 34. Under some circumstances for example where the cable has been bent or where the wires are very fine or very stifft , the wires 2 may be in disarray or they may extend laterally in front of the roller 44 and under such circumstances, the bar 54 provents mispacing of the wires in the recesses 28, 34.As the roller 44 sweeps acrc,ss working surface 27 of the templet 26, the mere fact that the parts 2 of the wires 2 are raised by the bar 54 will, in part, bring them into alignement with the recesses of the templet and the bar 54 additionally serves in effect to isolate the part 2 of each wire, which h lies betwenn the bar 54 and the roller 44, so that it will be subject to the desired influence of the roller 44. The positioning means, mentioned above, for the connector 6 comprises, as shown in Figures 4 to 6, to a positioning block 66 mounted on the inner end of the plate 20, and having a face 70 which is spaced from, and is directed towards, the end face 39 of the block 24, the spacing between the faces 70 and 39 being such that the connector 6 can be positioned therebetween as shown in Figures 4 to 6. The upper ends as seen in Figures 4 to 6 of the barrier walls 7 of the connector housing 3 are located against the downwardly as seen in Figures 4 to 6 facing surfaces of the projecting parts 42 of the barriers 40. The connector 6 is also located by means of a plate G8 secured to the upper as seen inFigures 4 to 6 surface of the block 66.The plate 68 extends rightwardly as seen in Figures 4 t o 6 over the frontal portion of the connector and has a depending flange 72 disposed between the rearwardly acting surface of the flange 9 of the connector 6 and he barrier walls 7 thereof. Slots 74 Figure 1 , in the plate 68 extend through the flange 72 thereof in alignment with the spaces between the barriers 40, the innertends of the slots 74 serving as fixed wire shearing edges for co operation with movable wire shearing edges 75 on a row of wire shearing and insertion punches 7S best seen inFigure 1 , described below.In general, the wire insertion means, the connector positionjng means, and the wire shearing means for trimming the wires 2 may be in accordance with the teachings of ous United StatesPatent Specification No. 3,760,335. After the wires 2 have been deployed by the roller 44 and the bar 54, as described above the free ends of the wires 2 extending as shown in Figure 6, over the upper surface of the plate 68, with each individual wire 2 in alignment with a terminal of the connector 6, the wires 2 are trimmed and inserted info the terminals by means of the punches 76. These pushes 76 extend from a block 78 secured to a tool holder 79 Figures 1 and 8 in turn secured to a cross head 80 solidably mounted on posts 81 extending from the block , 6. The cross head 80 is resiliently biased upwardly so the position ofFigures 1 and 8 by springs 83 acting between the block 66 and the cross head 80. The cross head 80 and the punches 76 are depressed through a working stroke during the final portion of the working stroke of the ram 16, by means of a lever 82 Figure 8 having an end portion which extends into a recess 84 in the cross head 80 and is receivable in an aligned recess 85 in the tool holder 79. The lever 82 is fixed by a pin 87 to a shaft 84 journaled in a bearingKnot shown fixed to the press frame. The shaft 84, e. tends from the neck portion 10 of the press frame as sh wn in Figure 1, one end of a link 88 being pinned to the shaft B4 Figure 1 . The other end of the link 88 is pivoted to one end of an adjustable length link 90 the other end of which is pivoted to an arm 92 extending from a bearing block 94 through which the shaft 20 extends.The shaft 20 is freely rotatable in the block 94 so that the mutter is not rotated or otherwise moved as the shaft 20 r ates. A disc 96 is keyed to the shaft 20 adjacent to the block 94, a pin 98 extending from the disc 96 for engagement with the arm 92. During the final stages of tI working stroke of the ram 16, the pin 98 engages the am 92 and swings it through a slight clockwise as seen Figure 1 arc. This clockwise movement of the arm 92.s translated into clockwise movement of the link 88 whit, in turn, causes the shaft 84 to rotate in a clockw.,e direction thereby swinging the arm 82 downwardly from t position of Figure 8. t will thus be apparent that after the wires 2 have been deppoyed on the templet 26 and aligned with the terminal of the connector 6, the insertion punches 76 will be moved through their working stroke during the final portion of the working stroke of the ram 16 so that the wires a are trimmed and inserted into the terminals of the conductor 6. The tun 16 can then be returned to its raised position by returning the lever 18 to the position of. Figure 1. After the connector 6 has been removed from the positions means, the wire controller assembly 53 can be returned to its starting position and the apparatus.prepared for a further cycle of the operation. The removal of the connector 6 with the wires 2 extending therefrom is accomplished hy sliding the block 24 away from the block 66 to provide clearance for the wires 2 which are now attaclled to the connector 6 , so that the connector 6 can be slid out laterally from its positioning means i.e. in a direction at right Angles to the plane of Figures 4 to 6 and 8 . The conrctor 6 can be inserted into i s positioning means by reversing this procedure. Although, as mentioned above, the connector 6 has two rows of terminals, only one such row is connected to wires by means of the apparatus. The terminals of the other row may be connected to wires by means oi other tooling, for example, a hand tool. The apparatus may be adapted for use, for example, with connectors of the type disclosed in our United StatesPatent Specification No. 4,043,017, which h,ai but a single row of terminals. The apparatus according to the second embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference toFigures 9 to 14. The apparatus serves to deploy our twisted pairs 102 of insulated electrical wires of in electrical cable 108 having an insulating jacket 110 n which the wires are disposed in coplanar juxtaposed relationship as best seen in Figure 14. As shown in Figures 9 and 10, the apparatus comprises a base plate 104 having legs 116 extending from its underside for supporting the plate 114 above the surface of a work benc. not shown . A generally rectangular frame blot 118 fixed to the upper as seen in Figures 9 and 10 surface 120 of the plate 114 has a pair of opposed ribs 122 extending from its lateral surfaces 124 for the full length thereof. The block 118 has a flat surface 126 facing away from the base plate 114.A calming bar 128 having a flct uppC .it surface 129 is mounted on the upwardly as seen in Figures 9 and 10 facing surface 132 of each rib 122 and extend from the left hand end as seen in Figure 9 of the block 118 to a position intermediate the ends thereof, at which position the rib 128 has an end ramp 130 which is inclined towards the adjacent surface 132 to provide a camming ramp for a purpose to. be explained below. A rectangular templet 134, in the form of a flat plate, fixedly mounted on the surface 126, has a forward end 136 which is adjacent to, and is positioned slightly beyond, the ramps 130. The rearward end 138 of the templet 134 is located near the rearward end of the frame block 118. A wire supporting working surface 140 of the templet 134, facing away from the surface 126, is formed with four shallow recesses 139 extending between the ends 136 and 138, each recess 139 being dimensioned to receive a twisted pair 102 of wires along the greater part of its length and to receive the two individual wires 104 and 106 of the pair 102 along a part of its length adjacent to the end 136 of the templet 134.As best seen in Figure 9, each recess 139 has a first rectilinear portion 142 which extends from the end 138 of the templet 134 to a position intermediate the ends 136 and 138 thereof, the portions 142 of the recesses 139 being arranged in parallel juxtaposed relationship, a second intermediate portion 144 which diverges from the portion 142 towards the end 136 of the templet 134, and a third, forward end, portion comprising a pair of individual spaced grooves 146 and 148 which extend from the portion 144 to the end 136 of the templet 134. The grooves 146 and 148 are each dimensioned to receive a single individual wire 104 or 106, rather than a twisted pair 102. The twisted pairs 102 of wires are pressed into the recesses 139 by means of a wire pressing member in the folk of a first roller 150 in accordance with the teaching of our United States Patent Specification No. 3,891,013.The roller 150 is rotatably mounted between the upper ends of arms 154 of a yoke having a cross member 156 provided with an operating handle 158, which member 156 spans the frame block 118 and the working surface 140 of the templet 134. The lower ends of the arms 154 are swingably mounted on pivot pins 160 which in turn are mounted in upstanding flanges 162 of actuating means in the form of a slide 163. The flanges 162 extend from side plates 164 of the slide 163 which plates are located on each side of the frame member 118 and extend below the base plate 114. A bottom plate 166 extends beneath the base plate 114 and is secured to the side plates 164 by fasteners 167. The plates 164 are guided for movement between the ends of the frame block 118 by rollers 168 which are received between the undersides of the ribs 122 and the surface 120 of the base plate 114.The rollers 168 are rotatably mounted on pins 170 which extend inwardly from the side plates 164. A wire controller member in the form of a second roller 152 having a wire deflecting surface 152 is providec to facilitate the placing of an individual twisted pairs 102 of wires in the portions 142 and 144 of the recesses 139 and to untwist the end portion of each twisted pair 102 as described below. The roller 152 comprises, in the present example, a cylindrical bar located in advance of the roller 150 and the ends of which are rotatably mounted in supports in the form of bell crank plates 172 disposed on each side of the frame block 118 and between the frame block 118 and the side plates 164 of the slide 163.Each plate 72 is mounted on a pivot pin 174 passing through the respective side plate 164 and is provided with a third, cam follower, roller 176 at its left hand as seen in Figures 9 and 10 or leading end portion, such roller 176 bearing against the upwardly as seen inFigure 10 facing surface 132 of the adjacent rib 122.The plates 172 are biased downwardly as seen in Figures 9 and 10 by springs 178 each of which is secured to a pin 180 in the associated side plate 164 at one end and to a pin 182 extending from the outer surface of the adjcent plate 172 at the other end. This arrangement permits the plates 172 to be raised through a slight clockwise as seen in Figures 9 and 10 arc during operation, as will be described below, against the action of the springs 178. The operation of the apparatus of the second embodiment will now be described in detail with particular reference to Figures 10 to 13. When it is desired to separate the four twisted pair 102 of the cable 108 and to untwist an end portion of each twisted pair 102, the cable jacket 110 is cut away to expose the twisted pairs 102 of wires as shown in Figure 14. The slide 163 of the apparatus is then moved to its rearward position Figure 9 up to the end 138 of the templet 134 and the yoke 154, 156 is swung by depressing the handle 158, to raise the roller 150 above the surface 140 Figure 11 . The four twisted pairs 102 of wires are then threaded through the space between the roller 140 and the upper surface of the roller 152 Figure 11 and the Iading edge 184 of the cable jacket 110 is located against the end 138 of the templet 134. The yoke 154, 156 i, then swung, by raising the handle 158, to move the rollt . . 150 onto the surface 140 of the templet 134 so as to pross portions of the individual twisted pairs 102 into the portions 142 of the recesses 139, adjacent to the end 138. Thc individual twisted pairs 102, then extend from beneath the roller 150 and over the surface 152 of the roller 152. The slide 163 is then advanced from the position of Figure 9 towards that of Figure 10 by means of t handle 158 which is used also to hold the roller 150 against the working surface 140 of the templet 134 during such movement of the slide 163.During this stage of the operating cycle of the apparatus seeFigure 12 the roller 152 is spaced from the roller 150 by a distance exceeding the transverse dimension of an individual twisted pair 102 the sum of the diameters of the two wires lo and 106 of a twisted pair 102 .Also during this movement of the slide 163, the rollers 176 run along the surfaces 132 of the ribs 122. The roller 152 serves the purpose, during its advance during this portion of the cycle of operation of the apparatus, of approximately aligning each twisted pair 102 with the portions 142 and 144 of one of the recesses 139 into which portions such twisted pair is to he placed. If the twisted pairs 102 should extend laterally e.g. by reason of curvature in the cable 108, the roller 152 will serve, by its, deflection of a part 102 of the twisted pair 102 away from the surface 140, to locate that part of each twisted pair 102, which part is adjacent to the roller 150, in alignment with the said portions 142 and 144 of the racesses 139 and will thus prevent misplacing of the individual twisted pairs 102. The action of the wire controller member 152 is the same as that of the wire controller member 54 discussed above. When the rollers 176 on the plates .72 of the slide 163 reach the ramps 130 and are raised thereby as the slide 163 is advanced, the plates 172 lre swung in a clockwise as seen in Figures 9 and 10 sense about their pivot pins 174 and against, the action of the springs 178, to move the rollers 152 relatively towards the roller 150, i.e. to retard the advance of the roller 152. Thus, when he rollers 176 move up the ramps 130, the spacin between the rollers 150 and 152 is reduced as shown inFigure 13.The spacing between the rollers 150 and 152 which remains after the rollers 176 have moved onto the surface, 129 of the camming bars 128 is substantially equal 0 the diameter of an individual wire 104 or 106 of a tristed pair 102, so that the twisted pairs cannot pass between the adjacent surfaces of the rollers 150 and 152 as these rollers move in unison towards the end 136 oI the templet 134.The end portions of the twisted pairs , 2 are therefore untwisted from each other and one of .hese end portions is positioned in each of the groove 146 and 148 by the rollers 150, the roller 152 finally dropping from the end 136 of the templet 134 down onto th surfaces 129 of the bars 128. Figure 10 illistres the positions of the parts of the apparatus immediat.y before the arriyal of the roller 152 at the end 136 E the templet 134 and accordingly shows the two wires 104 and 106 of each pair positioned in side byside space relationship. It will be apparent that the camming bas 128, the bell crank plates 172, and the rollers 17 function as a positioning means for changing and contro..ng the di stance between the rollers 150 and 152. When he wire end portions have been untwisted as described aber, the roller 150 is raised again and the slide 163 is returned to its starting position in preparation for e further cycle of operation of the apparatus. The principle, which is applied in the apparatus, of untwisting th pairs of wires can be illustrated by grasping a twated pair of wires adjacent to its end between the tubb and forefinger representing the rollers 150 and 152 and then pulling the pairs of wires axially. Such confining and pulling of the pair of wires causes the wires to untwist In order to permit their passage through the construction formed by the thumb and forefinger. It will also be apparent that the roller 152 serves a dual purpose, in that during the first part of the operating cycle and while the twisted pairs 102 of wires are being placed in the portions 142 and 144 of the recesses 139, the roller 152 approximately aligns each twisted pair 102 with the recess portion into which it is to be placed, whilst during the final portion of the operating cycle, the roller 152 co operates with the roller 150 to bring about the untwisting of the end portions of the wires 104 and 106 of each pair 102 so that the roller 150 can then roll the untwisted end portions of the wires into the grooves 146 and 148.This dual function of the roller 152 requires that its position relative to the roller 150 should change during the final portion of the operating cycle in that the roller 152 is then moved relatively closer to the roller 150 as illustrated in Figure 13. The apparatus of the second embodiment serves to deploy and locate the several twisted pairs of wires and to untwist the end portions of the wires of each pair, and can thus be used to prepare the wire ends for further operations which may be carried our subsequently to the deploying and untwisting operations. The apparatus can be incorporated, for example in a lead making machine not shown for installing electrical terminals on the ends of cables. In such case, the apparatus would be employed to deploy and untwist the wire pairs as described above, immediately prior to the formation by the machine of electrical connections bbetween the wires and the terminals, these being part of an electrical connector, for example. As described with reference to Figures 9 to 14, the cable 108 contains only four twisted pairs 102 of wires, these being disposed in juxtaposed coplanar relationship in the cable jacket 110 as mentioned above. The apparatus can, however, be used to deploy and untwist twisted pairs of wires in a cable not shown containing a greater number than four twisted pairs of wires with the pairs of wires bundled in the cable jacket so that the cable has a circular rather than a flat cross section. In such case the bundle of pairs of wires, will be flattened when the roller 150 is moved downwardly and against the wires Figures 11 and 12 and the individual pairs of wires will be located in the recesses in the templet, these being of the same number as the twisted pairs of the cable. The wire pressing member roller 150 and the wire controller member roller 152 need not essentially be in the form of rollers. These members are, however, advantageously rotatably mounted in order to reduce friction and to minimize the amount of force required to accomplish the deploying and untwisting operations.
