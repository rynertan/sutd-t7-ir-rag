# Ultrasonic measurement method, and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for ultrasonic measurement transmit ultrasonic pulses having a plurality of different frequencies into an object under investigation and derive a mean value of attenuation coefficients indicative of attentua tion within the object, as well as the frequency dependence of the attenuation coefficient. If the frequency dependence of the reflection intensity from the object under investigation is constant or proportional to frequency within a range of measured frequencies, it is possible to obtain the attenuation coefficient and the coefficient indicative of its frequency dependence within a small area of the object by measuring the echo intensity of emitted ultrasonic pulses having three different frequencies. Furthermore, extending the above mentioned processing over all amall areas of the entire object enables us to obtain a two dimensional distribution image indicative of the attenuation coefficient and its frequency dependence.
