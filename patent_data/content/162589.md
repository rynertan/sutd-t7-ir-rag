# Preparation of polymer polyols.

## Abstract
A novel family of modified polyols suitable for use in the preparation of fluid polymer polyols is provided. The modi fied polyols are the reaction product obtained by reacting a silicon atom containing compound with an unmodified po lyol, the silicon atom compound being one which has a at least olefinically unsaturated hydrocarbyl group and b at least one functional group which is reactable with the hy droxy groups on the polyol. Examples of such silicon atom containing compounds include vinyltriethoxysilane and vi nyltrimethoxysilane. Modified polyols of the type described are particularly useful in the preparation of polymer polyols containing high levels of polymer since they reduce the vis cosity of the final polymer polyol and decrease the tendency of the polymer polyol to produce polymer sediment.
