## Description
The objects of the present invention are a light alloy wheel having a profile with differentiated thick ness, provided with characteristics of particular light ness, and the process to obtain it. Light alloy wheels for vehicles, in particular made of aluminium alloy, manufactured either by permanent mould casting or by die casting, are already known and widely used. Such wheels show the drawback of having a not perfectly homogeneous structure, because of irregular solidifications, segregations of crystals and the like, and of requiring hence, in order to obtain the required mechanical characteristics, considerable thicknesses of the manufacture, with the use of considerable material amounts and consequent high weight and cost of the same wheel. Also wheels are known, which are obtained by assem bling, by means of bolting, welding, bonding and the like, two or more pieces of suitable shape, obtained by starting from metal sheets and or section bars extruded and shaped by the so called roll forming process, or by cold pressing.These wheels result generally more strong and light that those obtained by casting, but suffer from the drawback that each of said pieces is dimensioned, in thickness, and hence in weight, substantially along its whole profile, to the maximum thickness as determined in its point of highest stress, with consequent heavy waste of material, and considerable increase of the wheel weight. Purpose of the present invention is to provide a light alloy wheel for vehicles, in particular a wheel of aluminium alloy, able to overcome the drawbacks shown by the similar wheels used up to date, and to show in the overall a high strength and stiffness against strains and stresses, combined to high lightness characteristics. Another purpose of the invention is to provide a wheel constituted by components or elements of different shape, in particular made of aluminium alloy, all said elements being obtained by means of analogous forming processes, so as to considerably simplify the working cycle. A further purpose of the present invention is to provide a wheel with the minimum amount of material, with the mechanical characteristics remaining the same, with evident advantages as for the performance and the fuel consumption of the vehicle on which said wheel is instal led. These and still further purposes, which shall be more clearly evidenced by the following disclosure, are achieved by a light alloy wheel, in particular made of aluminium alloy, which wheel is constituted, according to the present invention, by components assembled with each other by welding, bolting, bonding and the like, each of them having a defined profile with thicknessdifferen tiated as a function of the stresses the said components undergo, said definition of the profile and said thick ness differentiation of the individual components being previously determined by mathematical modeling and compu tation analysis by interactive graphic system and being then practically embodied by shaping, according to the defined profile, by means of a lathe spinning process, elements of aluminium alloy obtained from rolled or press ed sheets and or from extruded tubular section profiles. More particularly, the wheel according to the pres ent invention is constituted by a first element obtained from a disc of metal sheet and shaped by lathe spinning so as to form as one sigle piece the wheel centre and the related inner half race , the thickness of said element being maximum in correspondence of the bores provided for the fastening of the wheel centre onto the hub, decreasing to 70 85 of said maximum thickness in the nearby of the brake cooling windows, on their side towards the wheel centre, and to 5575 in the nearby of said windows,on their side towards the inner half race, to assume then a value ranging from 40 to 60 in corres pondence of said inner half race, to said first element a second element being associated by welding, bondingand the like, said second element being obtained from a metal sheet disc or from a tubular section bar extruded and shaped, always by spinning, so as to form the outer half race , the thickness of said element being substan tially equal and corresponding to that of the inner half race shaped on the first element. It is known that a wheel under operating conditions, i.e., a wheel installed on a running vehicle, is mainly stressed by the following forces The components of these forces relating to the tire ground contact are converted into distributed ac tions, acting in correspondence of the tire tire rim. The whole of these contact actions and their distribution constitutes the system of forces directly stressing the wheel. Starting from this system of forces, and using, e.g., a suitable interactive graphic system which allows analysing, displaying it, the wheel behaviour under load, the minimum thicknesses necessary in the various points of the same wheel are defined, according to the present invention, as a function of the stresses under operating conditions. The working process by lathe spinning, in particular by using types of spinning lathes programmed and under numerical control, allows the desired thicknesses to be obtained with high precision, and without any limitations as for the minimum attainable thickness, also when start ing from high thickness metal sheets, easily reducing said thickness being possible, to an extent even higher than 50 of the initial thickness of the metal sheet and or of the extruded tubular section profile. Said wheel can be accomplished by advantageously using aluminium alloys of Al Mg type belonging to the series AA 5000, the so called work hardening alloys, or Al Si Mg alloys belonging to the series AA 6000, Al Zn alloys belonging to the series AA 7000,and Al Cu alloys belonging to the series AA 2000, the so called heat treatment alloys, and starting, as already said, from discs or rolled or pressed metal sheets and from extruded tubular profiles. The invention, as regards a preferred, but not ex clusive form of practical embodiment thereof, is dis closed in the following in greater detail, with reference to the attached drawing tables, given to purely indica tive and not limitative purposes, in which In Fig. 1 an example is shown of wheel according to the present invention, having a diameter of 13 inches 330.2 mm and a width of 4 inches 101.6 mm , designed to bear a load on the axle of 550 kg, and made from aluminium alloy AA 5154, containing about 3.5 of Mg. Referring to such figure, the first element or component of the wheel 1 constitutes the wheel centre 2 and the inner half race 3. On said first element the bore for the hub 4, the bores for the fastening bolts 5 and the win dows for the brake cooling 6 are provided. To said first element the second element 7, constituting the outer half race, is associated. As it can be seen from such a 1figure, the thickness of the wheel in the nearby of the holes 5 is of 6 mm, decreases to 5 mm and then to 4.5 mm in the nearby of the windows 6 towards the wheel centre, furthermore decreasing to 3.5 mm and then to 3 mm in correspondence of the inner half race. The thickness of the outer half race 7 is of 3 mm, i.e., correspondingly equal to the thickness of the inner half race. The overall weight of the wheel of Fig. 1, according to the present invention, results to be of 2.4 kg in total, i.e., lower by at least 30 than the weight of traditional light alloy wheels having the same character istics. In fig. 2 the same wheel of Fig. 1 is shown with the indication of the calculated values of the tensions, in N mm² Newtons per mm² on the inner and outer surfaces of the wheel, under limit conditions of travelling along a curve with vertical load F₁ of 5395 N 550 kg and transversal load F₂ of 3776 N 385kg , with the tire pressure being of 0.3 N mm² 3 kg cm² . In Figs. 3, 4 and 5 to exemplifying purposesthe sequential steps of the process for the accomplishment of the wheel in order to arrive to the end shape are shown, taking as reference the deformations occuring under ope rating conditions when travelling along a curve. Fig. 5 refers in particular to the wheel having the shape and thicknesses according to the invention, accord ing to what reported in Figs. 1 and 2 Figs. 3 and 4 relate to wheels manufactured from the same material under the same loading conditions, but with different distributions of the thicknesses. In Fig. 6 the disc of rolled sheet 8 is shaped by the action of the tool, schematically indicated with 9, against the die 10 fastened to the chuck of a spinning lathe, up to assume the shape of cone frustum 11. Said cone frustum is then machined on its inner side against a second die 12, up to assume the shape of the first element of the wheel 1. On said first element the bores for the hub, the windows and the bores for the fastening bolts are then provided, according to known processes, not shown. In Fig. 7 the process is schematically shown to obtain the second element of the wheel according to the invention, and namely the outer half race, starting from the metal sheet 13, spun by the tool 9 against the die 14, whilst in Fig. 8 the process to obtain the same second element starting on the contrary from an extruded tubular section profile 15 spun against the die 16 is shown. As it appears evident, in order to obtain the wheel according to the invention, only three dies, and namely two dies to produce the element 1 dies of types 10 and 12 , and one to produce the element 2 die of type 14 or, as an alternative, of type 16 , are necessary, with considerable simplifying of the process and with evident financial and practical advantages. The wheel of Fig. 1 can be further finished by submitting the disc to one or more pressing operation s to the purpose of providing, if necessary, ribs or projections, e.g., in correspond ence of the fastening zone. Moreover, the assembled wheel, or the two elements separately, can be submitted to surface treatments such as painting, anodizing, chemical or mechanical silking, to the purpose of impro ving the aesthetical appearance of the wheel and protect ing it, e.g., from the atmospheric agents or from the salts which are spread on the roads against ice during the winter season. Obviously, to the invention as hereinabove disclosed according to a preferred form of practical embodiment, structurally and functionally equivalent changes and variants can be provided, without going out of the pro tecting scope of the same invention.
