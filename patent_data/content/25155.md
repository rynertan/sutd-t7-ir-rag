# Nonvolatile semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
There is provided a nonvolatile semiconductor memory device which comprises memory cells MC 11 to MC MN arranged in the form of a matrix and formed of MOS FET s each having a floating gate, a plurality of word lines WI to WM each coupled to memory cells on the same row, and a plurality of data lines DI to DN each coupled to memory cells on the same column. In this semiconductor memory device, the sources of the MOS FET s forming the memory cells are coupled to a resistor RI .
