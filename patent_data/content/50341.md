# Gas circuit breaker of the resistance breaking type.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a gas circuit breaker of resistance breaking type, which comprises a main breaking unit 2 and a resistance contact mechanism 17, 18 electrically connected in parallel with the main breaking unit for resistively cutting off current. With the opening action of the main breaking unit, a spring 24 used for opening the resistance contact mechanism is energized and the energized force of the spring is released by a releasing mechanism 29, 31, 32 68, 69, 68a 52, 78, 79 after the current in the main breaking unit is cut off, thereby to act as a drive force to open the resistance contact means.
