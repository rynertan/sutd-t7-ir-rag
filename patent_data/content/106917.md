The nozzle in that burner is connected to the storage area or gas collection chamber via an appropriate line. The port in the nozzle has an opening of a controlled size and configuration, related to the size of the flame and the temperature and velocity of the burning gas mixture. Also, in my co pending patent application, Serial Number 367,051, for Electrical Particle Generator, filed April 4, 1982, there is disclosed an electrical generating system. The non magnetic pipe is filled with the discrete gas particles having a magnetic polarized field placed thereonThe magnetic charged gas particles, proceed through the pipe at a high velocity dependent on the pressure in the gas generator storage chamber. As the magnetic particles pass through the core of the winding there is induced a voltage current therein, that may be utilized in the same manner as any other electrical source.

SUMMARY OF INVENTION The present invention utilizes the basic principle of a particle accelerator and the principle of inducing a voltage current in a secondary winding by passing a magnetic element therethrough in combination with a hydrogen gas generator.The particle accelerator utilizes the principles of my co pending application, Serial Number, 367,051, and the hydrogen generator is particularly that of my co pending.atent application, 302,807. The structure comprises an electrical inductive winding, having a large number of turns and an output for utilizing the voltage current induced therein. The inductive winding is positioned around an endless closed loop, non magnetic pipe or tubing. The hydrogen gas generator encompasses an array of plates immersed in a pressure tight enclosure. Direct current voltage applied to the plates causes the hydrogen oxygen gasses to disassociated from the water molecule. The upper portion of the container is a hydrogen oxygen storage chamber for maintaining a predetermined gas pressure. A hydrogen oxygen gas mixture outlet means connects the non magnetic tubing to the storage chamber of the generator. Adjacent the outlet a magnetic polarizer establishes a magnetic field and imparts a magnetic potential to the hydrogen and the oxygen gas being pressure released from the outlet. The apparatus comprises a non magnetic pipe in a closed loop having a substantial amount of magnetized particles encapsulated therein. A magnetic accelerator assembly is positioned cn the pipe includes an inductive primary winding with a low voltage input. A secondary winding is positioned on the pipe opposite to the primary winding. Upon voltage being applied to the primary winding the magnetized particles accelerate through the magnetic accelerator assembly with increase velocity. The velocity accelerated particles induce an electrical voltages current potential as they pass through the secondary winding.In a closed loop system the process is continuous. The increased secondary voltage current is utilized in a direct current or alternate current amplifier arrangement. OBJECTS It is a principal object of the present invention to provide a hydrogen gas electrical generator capable of producing a voltage current much greater in magnitude hereintofore possible. Another object of the present invention is to provide such a hydrogen gas electrical generator utilizing magnetized elements and wherein the magnetized elements are charged gas particles from a hydrogen generator. Another object of the present invention is to provide such a hydrogen gas electrical generator in combination with a controlled output hydrogen generator. Another object of the present invention is to provide such an electrical generator that may be utilized with a hydro gen generator having another utility output for alternative generation. A further object of the present invention is to provide such an electrical generator that utilizes components readily available are adaptable to the simplified embodiment. Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description wren taken in conjunction with the drawings in which BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a simplified illustration of the principles of the invention, in crosssection showing the particles voltage current amplifier together with the hydrogen generator in a preferred embodiment, Figure 2 is a magnetic particle tubing, in an electrical schematic circuit arrangement, illustrating the induced direct and alternating current voltage.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS Referring now to Figure 1 there is illustrated the Inven tion of the preferred embodiment in a simplified schematic arrangement. The generator 10 comprises an airtight pressure enclosure housing 15. The housing 15 is filled with water 12 to a predetermined level. Immersed in the water 12 is an array of plates 14. In the preferred embodiment of the invention ofFigure 1, as disclosed in my co pending application serial number 302,807. The plates 14 are in pairs of similar ronoxidizing metal. A negative voltage current potential and a positive voltage current potential from source 16 is applied to alternate plates of the array 14. The generation of hyd sOen oxygen is a sub atomic process, i.e., not electrolysis. That is, the applied potential to the plates causes the hydrogen and oxygen atoms to disassociate themselves from the water ole cule. Accordingly, the process is operative with any water irrespective of its purity or ainount of contamination. It is understood, of course, that the hydrogen generator may be that of the electrolysis process although more costly and less efficient. In that event the plates 14 would an anode and cathode and the water would be distilled water with a chemical added. The released hydrogen gas depicted as particles 20a xxx n and oxygen gas particles 22a xxx n are collected and stored in the chamber 23 together with other released gasses such as nitrogen 21a xxx. The chamber 23 further includes switch means 57 to shut off the electrical source 16 to the generator system when the pressure in the chamber 23 sensed by pressure gauge, 55, achieves a predetermined level. In the operation of the hydrogen generator as a burner, as disclosed in the co pending patent application Serial Number 411,797, the outlet tube 25 is connected directly to the nozzle 40 to obtain the flame 45 upon ignition. The operation of the gas burner is not altered in the present invention. There is interposed in the line 25, a magnetic polarizer 30 having magnetic poles 32 and 34. The magnetic polarizer 30 may be a permanent magnet or an electrical magnet capab, 2 creating a magnetic field 36 across the non magnetic tiny 25.The magnetic field 36 in turn imparts a magnetic charge tot gasses released from the storage chamber 33. The hydrogen gns particles become positively magnetically charged and the c t.ygen particles become negatively magnetically charged producing a magnetized gas mixture. Also interposed in the outlet tubing 25 adjacent to the magnetic polarizer 30 is a series of loops of non magnetic tubing 50. The tubing in its loop configuration can be any one of the arrangements illustrated in my co pending patent application, serial number supra. The opposite end 51 of the loop 60 tubing is connected via a Y connection either te the burner assembly 40, via line 35, or a return line 42 to te storage chamber 23. As aforesaid, the storage chamber 23 is maintained at a predetermined pressure and once the pressure is attained the gas particles will be expelled into outlet line 25 with a substantial velocity.The pressure released particles become charged by the magnetic polarizer 30 and pass through the entire loop arrangement of tubing 50 The loop arrangement of tubing 50 has wound thereon a substantial number of turns 60a xxx n in a winding 60. The number and size of the turns is related to the tubing configuration and voltage current output. The magnetically charged gas particles traveling with a high pressure velocity pass through the tubing 55. As the magnetically charged gas particles pass through the core of the winding 60, there is induced a voltage current therein through its inductive field The output voltage current is utilized via terminals 70 72. Upon demand for the flame, such as for heat from demand circuit 65, the valve 37 is opened causing the gas mixture to so to the nozzle 40 and provide the flame 45 upon ignition. Upon satisfaction of the demand, the valve 37 will close and thereby cause the gas mixture to return to the collection chamber 23 via close loop line 42. In this arrangement the pump 45 will turn on and cause a continuous circulation of the gas through the closed loop. One way check valve 49 assures that no gas enters line 42 when the pump 45 is quIescent. If the gas in the collection chamber is of the preset pressure, as sensed at gauge 55, the voltage via terminal 16 will be cutoff discontinuing the generation of gas. With particular reference to Figure 2 there is illustrated, partly in schematic and partly pictorial, the preferred embodiment of the invention. Initially it is noted that the pump 45 of Figure 1 has been replaced by the particle accelerator 46. The accelerator 46 is a non mechanical no moving part element and therefore not subject to wear. It is to be recalled the hydrogen and oxygen gasses have placed there on a magnetic field potential. Hence,.as the magnetized gasses approach the accelerator 46 they are attracted and as they pass the center of the accelerator and they are propelled therethrough. Other propulsion means in lieu of the pump 45 of Figure 1 or the accelerator 46 of Figure 2 may be utilized. The volume of the hydrogen oxygen gas as dictated by the storage area 23 and the pressure of the hydrogen oxygen gas stored therein determines the magnetic field strength. The greater the pressure, the greater the velocity and, in turn the greater the voltage current output. As noted in the aforesaid co pending patent app7ic2t on the induced current voltage can be, at the output 70 72, either direct current, or alternating current, or both. With reference to Figure 2, the simplified schemetic illustrates a direct current voltage 4 parallel winding and an alternating current 75 in serial winding. The number of coils 74a xxx n of direct current windlngs of coil 74 will determine the ripple frequency of the direct current voltage and its amplitude. Similarly, the number of alternating current windings 75a xxx n will determine the alternati fre quency of the alternating current voltage and its plituee. More importantly, the aforesaid ripple frequency of the sirglet polarity voltage of coil 74 and alternating frequency of the alternating. voltage of coil 75 can be altered varied, and controlled. That is, the frequency is a function of the numreror discrete windings of the coils tines the velocity of tbe gas per second. The. velocity of the gas, in turn, is varied by varying its magnetic field and the magnetic field is varied by varying the pressure of the gasses in the chamber 23. Further, it has been found that the increase in pressure of the gasses in chamber 23 increases the velocity of the gas exponentially. Simply, an arithmetical increase in pressure of the gasses released results in a geometrical increase in frequency and amplitude of the output voltage from either the direct current winding 74 or the alternating current wftding 75. There will be instances where an increase in velocity pressure is needed to increase the output voltage of the electrical generator but the generation of more hydrogen gas may be undesirable. That is, for instance, the flame 45 is a controlled gas mixture flame. The addition of more hydrogen will increase the temperature of the combustibility of the fixture and will increase its velocity. The utility of the flame, if not quenched, will be affected proportionately. Accordingly, to increase the gas pressure in chamber 23 other non combustible gasses 21a xxx n, such as nitrogen are added via pressure inlet means to the mixture. Although certain and specific embodiments are shown and described, alternatives and modifications may be had without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
