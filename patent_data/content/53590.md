## Description
This invention relates to the technical field of the tubes which are cold deformable, iOe. tubes that are able to permanently but reversibly take a desired configuration when bent in a cold state. Methods for manufacturing such tubes are already known and the tubes are commercially available in different embodiments, all more or less showing the drawback of having a comparatively expensive manufacturing method. An object of this invention is to provide a method for manufacturing said permanently reversibly cold deformable tubes, which method allows to at least substantially overcome the prior art drawbacks, while maintaining some beneficial features thereof. According to the invention the method of manufacturing said tubes is characterized in that after the extrusion of a first core the inner one , a deformable aluminium core element is wound thereon, and then a second or outer core is extruded in such a manner to retain the central aluminium core, while allowing the outer core material to get sealed with the inner core material through interspaces or openings of the aluminium core. Preferably the material used for both the inner and outer core are identical and consist, for example, of a product known under the trade name RILSAN trade mark , so that it is possible to obtain a permanently deformable tube which can be fed even with high corrosire products, foodstuffs, petroleum products, etc., so to widen the application range of such tubes in the field of the pipe systems for the above products. According to one embodiment of the invention, said interspace is obtained by covering the surface of the inner core with wound coils between which a clearance is left to ensure a penetration of the extruded material to the inner core, thereby obtaining a sealing of the outer core with the inner one. No restriction exists as to the winding since, without prejudice to the idea of creating an interspace allowing for the sealing of the outer core with the inner one during the extrusion step which obviously does not necessarily imply the use of the same material for both the outer and inner cores the wound strips may be in the form of a strap, or in the form of a wire. In other words, as far as the winding is concerned, it has to be noted that the essential feature is the permanent defor ability of the aluminium core, and therefore the win ding can be made in the form of a strap or of a wire without departing from the scope of the invention. Instead of a winding, one could foresee a strip which is bent such as to form or not a longitudinal butt joint. In this case, however, in order to achieve fastening of the deformable aluminium core in an easy manner, the aluminium strip surface should have perforations or the like to ensure a penetration of the thermoplastic material from the outer core to the inner one during the outer core extrusion step, and then an autogenous seal of the two extruded cores of thermoplastic materials. The above and further features, as well as other objects and advantages of the invention, will appear from the following description of an embodiment thereof, as shown in the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is a logitudinal cross sectional view showing the inner core after the winding step of an aluminium strap therearound Figure 2 is a cross sectional view similar to that of figure 1, showing the finished tube Figure 3 is a view similar to that of figure 1, showing an alternative embont Figure 4 is a cross sectional view similar to that of fig.2 of the embodiment of figure 3, in which, instead of a spiral means, an aluminium strip is provided which can be fastened by butt joint, and has openings or through holes provided therein Figures 5 and 6 are cross sectional views showing two successive steps for tightly sealing two permanently deformable tubes Figure 7 is a diagrammatical view showing a permanently deformable tube according to the invention, when laid down. Equal or similar parts will be designated by the same references throughout the following description and drawings. With reference..in particular to figures 1 and 2 AI shows an inner core of a permanently deformable tube, said inner core consisting of a hollow cylindrical extruded body in a thermoplastic material, which is preferably resistant to corrosion. As a not restrictive example, the product known under the trade name P tSAN trade mark may be used. The outer surface of said inner core may be knurled, i,e, may be provided with longitudinal knurls not shown . According to this invention a method of manufacturing is provided for, wherein, after the extrusion step of said inner core AI, the same inner core is covered by means of a strip f0i. a strap ST1 of aluminium, the thickness and width of said strip being suitably chosen so to ensure the required permanent cold deformability. The adjacent turns SP1 SP2 are spaced apart by an interspace TR for purposes that will appear later on. After the winding operation, an outer core AE, is extruded according to well known methods, the material of The outer core being preferably the same product RILSAN as that used for the inner core, During said second core extrusion step, an autogenous sealing together of the two inner and outer cores is obtained due to the provision of the interspace TR as above described, As a result, the intermediate aluminium core ST1 is thoroughly fastened between the two cores AI AE.As previously stated, the thicknesses of the inner and outer cores, the thickness of the aluminium strip, the winding pitch and the width of the wound strip, as well as the width of the interspace are parameters which depend on the permanent deformability degree the tube is required to provide for without incurring the risk of undue collapsing thereof and, therefore, without undesirable head losses therein, As already mentioned hereinbefore, use of a wire instead of a strap could be made without departing from the sco.pe of the invention, Figure 4 shows the way in which the same result could be obtained, according to an alternative embodiment 2 of the invention, by using an aluminium strip ST which can be bent so as to form a butt joint CG, In this case, however, the aluminium strip should be provided with perforations PE to allow the extruded material to pass through said perforations and thus achieve said autogenous sealing of the two cores through the longitudinally bent aluminium strip ST2. With reference now to figure 5, there is shown the way in which tubes obtained by the method of the invention may be sealingly coupled together, The two ends RS12S2 of adjacent tubes are first engaged by a double truncated cone element TC made from the same material as the cores then a sleeve IEN previously slipped over one tube of the same core material is overled finally, said outer sleeve 1EN is caused to melt, thereby obtaining an autogenous sealing of the two adjacent tube ends0 Since the RILSAN product melts at about 2100 C, nothermofusion problems should arise. Prom the above, it clearly appears that the invention mainly relates in the coupling sealing of the outer core with the inner core during the extrusion of the outer core element and by exploiting passageways as provided for by the intermediate aluminium core. The objects and advantages of the invention can be ready appreciated from the above description.
