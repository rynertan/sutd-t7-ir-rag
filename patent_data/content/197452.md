## Description
The present invention relates, in general, to a method for producing high quality epitaxial layers of group III V, group II VI and group IV compositions by means of molecular beam epitaxy MBE . More particularly, the invention relates to a method of producing such epitaxial layers having smooth surface morphologies using MBE techniques under growth conditions which normally produce rough surfaced growth. The production of high quality epitaxial layers of group III V compositions, such as GaAs, AlGaAs, and InP, is extremely important to the realization of improved high speed, optical and other semiconductor devices. Other compositions, such as group II VI and group IV compounds, are similarly important. While liquid phase epitaxy LPE has been the dominant process used to produce such layers, MBE has recently become more widely used. It has been noted that when MBE is used to produce layers such as Al Alterations in the MBE growth conditions have been suggested to alleviate the rough surface phenomenon. These include raising the substrate temperature, drastically reducing the growth rate and or controlling the V III flux ratio. However, in some situations it is desirable to grow Al Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of producing smooth surfaced epitaxial layers by MBE under growth conditions which would normally produce rough surfaced layers. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a method of growing a substantially smooth surfaced epitaxial layer of monocrystalline material comprising the steps of This and other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art from the detailed description below taken together with the drawings. In the particular embodiment of the present invention described herein, a three chamber Varian GEN II MBE system was used to grow epitaxial layers of Al Reproducibly measuring temperatures in MBE systems is particularly difficult. In the particular embodiment of the present invention these difficulties were overcome as follows. Direct measurements were obtained by means of a thermocouple which was placed in contact with the backside of the mounting block. In addition, a dual wavelength infrared pyrometer was used to observe the temperature of the substrate surfaces on the front surface of the mounting block. Finally, Reflected High Energy Electron Diffraction RHEED patterns were observed and used in conjunction with the GaAs congruent sublimation temperature of 640 C to calibrate the other temperature readings. Referring now to FIGs. 1A 1D, the growth of Al The convention used in describing the orientation of a surface of a crystal substrate involves the relationship of a line perpendicular to the surface of the substrate to the axes of the substrate crystal. The axes of the crystal are defined with respect to the unit cell which specifies the atomic structure of the crystal. Sample A FIG. 1A serves as a control and is nominally a 100 substrate, as is commonly used. In fact, the orientation of this substrate was determined by X ray diffraction to be 0 7 away from 100 toward a 111 A, or 111 gallium, axis. The orientation of sample B is 2 33 away from the 100 toward a 111 B axis. The orientation of sample C is 2 45 away from the 100 toward a 111 A axis. The orientation of sample D is 3 6 away from the 100 axis toward a 111 B axis. These substrates were obtained by conventional crystal cutting techniques and the orientations were each verified by X ray diffraction. These four samples were grown simultaneously, so as to avoid any differences in growth conditions. They were mounted with indium on a single mounting block, which was rotated during growth. Substrate temperatures were maintained at 675 C, which is a condition which normally produces rough surfaced growth on nominally 100 substrates. The beam equivalent pressures BEP , as determined by a nude ion guage rotated into the growth position, were 6.7 x 10 ⁷ torr for Ga and 7.0 x 10 ⁸ torr for Al. The As₄ BEP was 11.4 x 10 ⁶ torr. No intentional doping was carried out. The resulting growth rate is approximately 1 micron hour. The layer produced is p type Al The growth conditions described normally produce rough surface morphology, as is evidenced in FIG. 1A. This surface morphology has been previously reported and has been cited as the cause of a number of performance degradations of devices constructed with such layers. Samples B and D FIG.s 1B and 1D, respectively also show surface roughness. It is apparent that a mis orientation toward the 111 B axis is not effective to produce smooth surfaced growth. The phase contrast micrograph of sample C, however, shows a surface substantially free of the rough morphology of the other samples. The only defect apparent in illustrated portion of sample C is an oval defect of the type which has been reported elsewhere and which is thought to be unrelated to rough surface morphology. As is apparent from FIG. 1C, it is possible to produce smooth surfaced layers of Al The peak in the spectrum of sample C which is labelled 1.698 eV is thought to result from the recombination of a bound exciton. This peak has a full width at half maximum of approximately 5 meV. This peak is thought to be indicative of relatively high quality material. A higher substrate temperature and or a lower V III flux ratio might have produced better results. The peak at 1.679 eV is thought to be related to a free to bound transition involving carbon acceptors. The peak at 1.664 eV is also thought to be acceptor related, with the acceptor possibly being silicon. A phonon replica of this peak is seen at 1.629 eV. The spectrum of sample D shows a substantially lower quantity of bound exciton recombination than that of sample C. Indeed, no peak corresponding to an excitonic transition is apparent. The peak at 1.659 eV and its shoulder on the high energy side are believed to be related to impurities. The peak at 1.646 eV is believed to be defect related. This spectrum is typical of those of all rough surfaced samples. A comparison of the PL spectra of FIG. 2 demonstrates that the defect related peak at 1.646 eV in sample D, which is typical of prior art layers, is greatly reduced in intensity in the critically mis oriented sample C. In fact, the spectrum of sample C shows no evidence of a defect related peak at the scale of FIG. 2. In addition, the bound exciton peak at 1.698 eV in the spectrum of sample C is thought to be evidence of improved material quality. This peak is apparently absent in the spectrum of sample D. The rough surface morphology of Al The mis orientation required to alleviate this problem is most likely to be specific to the particular growth conditions. To investigate this possibility, a number of A1 A number of samples of A1 Table I, below, summarizes the results of a number of sample runs carried out at a substrate temperature of 620 C. In each case, A1 Table II, below, summarizes the results of a number of samples grown at a substrate temperature of 650 C. Other than the temperature and the several BEP s which are shown, the conditions were identical to those of the 620 C samples. Finally, TABLE III, below, summarizes the results of a number of sample runs at a substrate temperature of 675 C. In these runs, the Al fraction was 0.15. The other conditions were unchanged. Photoluminescence spectra obtained for some of the samples described above confirm the conclusion that the smooth surface morphology generally indicates a higher quality layer. FIG.s 3A and 3B are photomicrographs in cross section illustrating the improvement in layer quality obtained by correctly mis orienting the substrate. FIG. 3A is a cross section at approximately 1000X of the layer grown on the nominally 100 substrate in sample run 178 see TABLE II . As is apparent, epitaxial layer 10 has a number of morphological defects visible at this magnification. FIG. 3B is a similar cross sectional view of epitaxial layer 12 which was grown on the substrate oriented 5 from the 100 toward a 111 A axis in sample run 178. As is apparent, the improved surface morphology apparent in FIG. 1C corresponds to an improved structure throughout the layer. This implies that mis orienting the substrate in the proper direction may improve the homogeneity of dopants introduced during layer growth. FIG.s 4A and 4B illustrate the improvement in surface morphology realized by the use of the present invention. Both are graphs representing the output of an instrument a Sloan DEKTAK II profilometer which scans the surface of a body and produces a representation of the surface profile thereof. In both FIG.s, the horizontal axis represents distance over the surface of the body in microns and the vertical axis represents the relative height of the surface in angstroms. FIG. 4A is the surface profile of a portion of the epitaxial layer grown on a nominally 100 substrate in sample run 153 see TABLE III . The surface varies in relative height by more than 500 angstroms over distances of less than 10 microns. FIG. 4B is the surface profile of the layer grown on a substrate oriented 2.75 away from the 100 toward a 111 A axis. The vertical axis of this graph is expanded by approximately a factor of two with respect to that of FIG. 4A. This surface varies by less than approximately 100 angstroms over a distance of more than 10 microns. Obviously, if one desires to produce an epitaxial layer 10 only a few hundred angstroms in total thickness, the layer of FIG. 4A is unacceptable. On the other hand, the layer grown on a critically mis oriented substrate has sufficient surface smoothness to be useful in such an application. A method of producing high quality epitaxial layers by MBE growth has been described. The method allows the production of smooth surfaced layers under growth conditions which normally produce rough surfaced growth. Various modifications and changes will be apparent to one skilled in the art.
