# AN ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT FOR SIMULATING SOUND FROM A ROTARY LOUDSPEAKER

## Abstract
A device for electronically simulating vibrato and tremu lant effects and the radiation effects produced by a rotary loud speaker with the aid of two loudspeakers, 34, 50 , in which a musical tone signal 20 is applied to a variable delay device 22 associated with one of the loudspeakers 34 . The fre quency modulated signal B produced by the variable delay device is also subjected to amplitude modulation in a modula tor 40 controlled in synchronism with the variable delay devi ce, and the resulting composite signal applied to the other loudspeaker 50 . Additionally, the high frequency compo nents of the frequency modulated signal from the variable de lay device may be summed in an amplifier 46 , in an out of pha se relationship, with the composite amplitude modulated sig nal C to simulate the effect of a rotating high frequency horn radiator. The sub audio modulating signal, which may be for example at 1Hz for a chorus effect, or 7Hz for a tremulant effect, is produced by an oscillator 26 , and the degree of am plitude and or frequency modulation may be dependant on this sub audio frequency.
