# Method of and apparatus for obtaining a radiation image by use of a stimulable phosphor.

## Abstract
A radiation image conversion panel 13 is made of a stimulable phosphor 22 which stores radiation energy when exposed to a radiation and emits light when stimulated by visible light or infrared rays. The panel 13 is subjected to excitation before it is exposed to a radiation for recording or storing a radiation image therein by exposing the panel 13 to light having a wavelength within the range of stimulating light wavelength of the stimulable phosphor 22 used in the panel 13 . By exciting the panel 13 before exposure to radiation, the energy of radiation stored therein which will cause a noise is removed therefrom.
