# IN VITRO BIOASSAY OF ERYTHROPOIETIN

## Abstract
An in vitro boiassay for erythropoietin comprising th steps of preparing a liquid assay mixture from a Manor Cell Preparation incubating the assay mixture in the presence labeled thymidine to produce a liquid incubation mixture. At the end of an incubation period the cell material is separated from the liquid incubation mixture and the separated cell material is subjected to a quantitative determination of the incorporated labeled thymidine which is proportional to the erythropoietin content of the sample. The Manor Cell Preparation is prepared by inducing anemia in a rabbit, administering actinomycin D to the anemic rabbit and thereafter collecting bone marrow from the rabbit.
