## Description
This invention relates to integrated semiconductor circuits and more particularly to arrays of one device memory sells having a high cell density. Integrated semiconductor circuits including arrays or memories having, e.g., single transistor cells have achieved high cell densities. In U.S. Patent 4,012,757, filed May 5, 1975, there is disclosed a one device per bit memory wherein the storage devices are grouped in pairs and share a common gate member and a common capacitive plate. U.S. Patent 4,125,854, filed December 2, 1976, teaches a static random access memory array of cross coupled memory cells wherein a common drain supply node is centrally disposed within a group of four mutually contiguous cells. U.S. Patent 4,287,571, filed on September 11, 1979, by S. N. Chakravarti and J. A. Hiltebeitel, discloses a dense read only memory ROM having one contact shared by four cells. Here the transistors themselves have different threshold voltages and act as storage elements. U.S. Patent 4,376,983, filed March 21, 1980, describes an array of one device dynamic memory cells which uses three levels of polysilicon with zigzag lines to achieve high density. IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 24, No. 7B, December 1981, pages 3815 3816, IBM Corp., New York, USA, describes an array of one device dynamic memory cells formed in a substrate and in which the storage capacitors are coupled to diffusion regions through switching devices. Three random access memory cells are coupled together through a common diffusion region to a bit line. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved low cost, high density array of one device dynamic memory cells having a higher transfer ratio between storage capacitor and bit line capacitance due to an improved cell layout and reduced bit line lengths. The invention is defined by claim 1. The objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following and more particular description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Referring to the drawings in more detail, there is shown in Fig. 1 a plan view of a one device dynamic memory cell array of the present invention and in Fig. 2 a sectional view of the array of Fig. 1 taken through line 2 2 of Fig. 1. As can be seen in Figs. 1 and 2, a plurality of groups of one device dynamic memory cells 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 are shown, at least in part, formed on a semiconductor substrate 26, preferably made of silicon. Disposed on the substrate 26 and between the memory cell groups 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 is a thick oxide or silicon dioxide layer 28 which may be formed in any known manner to provide appropriate isolation. Each of the groups of cells, such as group 10, includes a common N diffusion region D, storage capacitors C1, C2, C3 and C4 and transfer devices T1, T2, T3 and T4, preferably field effect transistors, arranged to couple the storage capacitors to the common diffusion region D. A thin insulating layer 30, Preferably made of silicon dioxide, is grown on the substrate 26 adjacent to the thick oxide layer 28, as seen more clearly in Fig. 2 of the drawings. Each of the storage capacitors includes an N diffusion region or N type inversion region 32 and a plate formed by a first layer 33 of polysilicon with the thin dielectric layer 30 of silicon dioxide interposed therebetween. Second and third layers of polysilicon are used to provide gate electrodes for the transfer devices. One of the two polysilicon layers 34 is used for the gate electrodes of devices T2 and T4 and the other of the two polysilicon layers, not shown in Figs. 1 and 2, is provided for forming gate electrodes for devices T1 and T3 of the group 10. A suitable insulating layer 36, such as silicon dioxide, is grown to isolate polysilicon layer 33 from polysilicon layer 34. The insulating layer 36 may also be used to form the gate dielectric of the transfer devices T2 and T4. Another suitable insulating layer 38, such as silicon dioxide, is also grown to isolate polysilicon layer 34 from the other of the two gate electrode polysilicon layers. Bit sense lines BL0, BL1 and BL2 preferably made of copper doped aluminum, are deposited over the polysilicon layers and insulated therefrom by the layer 38 of silicon dioxide. Bit sense lines BL0, BL1 and BL2 contact common diffusion region D through openings 40 in the silicon dioxide layer 38. In Fig. 3 there is shown a schematic diagram of the group 10 of one device memory cells illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 of the drawings. As can be seen, group 10 includes a first memory cell having storage capacitor C1, transfer device T1 and common diffusion region D, a second memory cell having storage capacitor C2, transfer device T2 and common diffusion region D, a third memory cell having storage capacitor C3, transfer device T3 and common diffusion region D and a fourth memory cell having storage capacitor C4, transfer device T4 and common diffusion region D. Transfer device T2, having a gate electrode made of polysilicon layer 34, is connected to a word line WL6 and transfer device T4, having a gate electrode also made of polysilicon layer 34, is connected to a word line WL8. The gate electrodes of transfer devices T1 and T3 are connected to word lines WL5 and WL7, respectively. In the operation of the array illustrated in Figs. 1, 2 and 3, it can be seen that, e.g., by selectively applying an appropriate word pulse to word lines WL5, WL6, WL7 or WL8 of group 10, data applied to bit sense line BL1 from an external data source may be stored in any one of the storage capacitors C1, C2, C3 or C4 of group 10. Also, by coupling an appropriate sense amplifier to bit sense line BL1 and turning on a desired one of the transfer devices T1, T2, T3 or T4, data stored in any one of the storage capacitors C1, C2, C3 and C4 can be readily detected. It should be noted that by arranging the bit sense lined as indicated more clearly in Fig. 1, the length of the bit sense lines is shorter than in known one device memory cell arrays to provide a higher transfer ratio between the storage capacitors and the bit sense line capacitance. To better understand the advantages of the present invention, the lithography limit may be designated as L and thus all shapes and spaces are set at a length L. For example, the area of each storage cell is L², as is each transfer device and also each N diffusion region D. Accordingly, a conventional one device memory cell, such as disclosed in the above identified U.S. Patent 4,376,983, requires six lithography squares or an area of 6L², i.e., one square for the storage capacitor, one for the transfer device, one half for the diffusion region, which is shared between two cells, and three and one half for the isolation region. However, it can be seen that in the layout of the array of the present invention, one cell occupies only five lithography squares with the diffusion region D being shared by four cells. Key to this layout is the placement of a plurality of transfer devices, preferably four devices, around each diffusion region D, or bit sense line contact area, in such a way that the array of cells is built up without wasting surface area on the substrate or chip, i.e. the cells shape must tile a plane, while coupling the storage capacitors to the diffusion region. With four transfer devices around each contact, all cells may be formed by using three levels or layers of polysilicon. It should be noted that the equal sided cross shape arrangement illustrated in Fig. 1 tiles the entire plane. This cell layout not only increases array density with a given capacitor size, but it also significantly reduces the bit sense line capacitance per cell, with reduced bit sense line diffusion contact regions, when compared with conventional cell layouts. The reduced bit sense line capacitance is due to the shorter length of the bit sense line between contact points. It can be seen that the contact spacing is equal to As indicated hereinabove, with four cells having a common diffusion region D, as shown in Fig. 1 of the drawings, four unique word lines are required around the bit sense line diffusion or contact region D for conventional one device random access memory operation. Two of these four word lines may be formed from the layer 34 of polysilicon, with the storage nodes under the first polysilicon layer 33, and the other two word lines may be formed from a third level or layer of polysilicon. To illustrate the arrangement of word lines around the N diffusion region D, reference may be had to Figs. 4, 5 and 6 of the drawings, which show portions of arrays of the present invention, each being similar to that of Fig. 1 and with similar elements being identified by the same reference characters. As shown in Fig. 4 of the drawings, word line WL2, made in a zigzag fashion from the layer of polysilicon 34 and connected to conventional word line drivers 42, forms gate electrodes for transfer devices T2 of groups 12 and 24 and word line WL4 forms gate electrodes for transfer devices T4 of groups 12 and 24. Likewise, word lines WL6 and WL8 form gate electrodes for transfer devices T2 and T4, respectively, of groups 10 and 22. As can be seen in Fig. 5 of the drawings, word line WL1, made in substantially a straight line from a polysilicon layer 44 and also connected to the word line drivers 42, forms, with the use of tabs or projecting segments, gate electrodes for transfer devices T1 of groups 12 and 24 and word line WL3 forms gate electrodes for transfer devices T3 of groups 12 and 24. Likewise, word lines WL5 and WL7 form gate electrodes for transfer devices T1 and T3, respectively, of groups 10 and 22. Of course, word lines WL1, WL3, WL5 and WL7 made from polysilicon layer 44 and word lines WL2, WL4, WL6 and WL8 made from polysilicon layer 34 are superimposed one upon the other over the semiconductor substrate 26, however, in the interest of clarity, word lines WL2, WL4, WL6 and WL8 have been omitted from Fig. 5 of the drawings. It should be noted in Figs. 4 and 5 that the bit sense line BL1 contacting groups 10 and 12 and the bit sense BL2 contacting groups 22 and 24 are connected to conventional bit line drivers and sense amplifiers 46 and are arranged generally perpendicular to the direction of the word lines. There are other possible array arrangements which may be preferred in any given groundrule set. For example, word lines WL1, WL3, WL5 and WL7 shown in Fig. 5 may be replaced by the arrangement of word lines WL1, WL3, WL5 and WL7 shown in Fig. 6 wherein the word lines traverse the array in a generally diagonal direction with vertical metal straps 48 and 50 used to interconnect appropriate segments of these word lines. It can be seen in Fig. 6 that word line WL1 serves not only transfer device T1 of group 12 but also, via metal strap 48, transfer device T3 of group 22. Likewise, word line WL3 in Fig. 6 serves transfer device T3 of group 12 and transfer device T1 of group 24, and, via strap 50, other transfer devices not shown. Word line WL5 serves transfer device T1 of group 10 and transfer device T3 of group 24 and word line WL7 serves transfer device T3 of group 10 and transfer device T1 of group 22. The bit sense lines BL1 and BL2 in Fig. 6 are arranged in a similar manner to that shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that a dense one device memory cell array is provided which may use very small storage capacitors and wherein substantially the entire array area is utilized for the cell structure except for the necessary thick isolation required between the cells. Although there is illustrated in the figures of the drawings only a few cells associated with each word line, it should be understood that, if desired, hundreds of cells may be associated with each word line and that the number of word lines may also be increased to at least several hundred. Furthermore, although the illustrated embodiments have been described as having a P type substrate, it should be noted that an N type substrate may be used, if desired, by interchanging the conductivities, such as the N and P regions in the substrate, as is known.
