# SUBSTRATE WITH OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS BETWEEN CHIPS MOUNTED THEREON

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a complex circuit composed of a circuit board Silicon Mother Board which is formed of crystal line elemental silicon in the form of a slice and circuit compo nent in the form of semiconductor integrated circuits Flip Chip thereon which are preferably formed of a Group III V com pound. Signals from each of the integrated circuits are trans mitted to other integrated circuits on the board or externally of the board either by conventional printed conductors on the board or, preferably, by means of a laser TX formed in each integrated circuit at each output terminal thereon which trans mits light signals along light conducting members Optical Link in the silicon board to photo responsive elements RX at the in put locations on other ones of the integrated circuits on the board for external to the board. The light signal is transferred from an integrated circuit output to an integrated circuit input or to a device external to the board by means of light conduct ing members. These light conducting members may be light conducting rods positioned either on the surface of the board or in grooves formed therein. Alternatively, the light conduct ing members can be silicon dioxide paths formed in the silicon circuit board by selective oxidation of the silicon board to form silicon dioxide light conducting paths therein. Each light con ducting path is coupled between a light emitting output from an integrated circuit and a light emitting input of another inte grated circuit or travel to the edge of the circuit board for trans mission external of the board.
