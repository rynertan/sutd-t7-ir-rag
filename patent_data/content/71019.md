# 2,3 Dialkoxypropyl glyceryl ether and its preparation process as well as cosmetic composition containing same.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein is a novel 2,3 dialkoxypropyl glyceryl ether and the preparation process for it. The above diglycerin dialkyl ether is readily prepared with high yield and purity by reacting its corresponding glycidyl ether with a protected glycerin to form a 1,3 dioxolan compound, followed by etherifying the thus formed 1,3 dioxolan compound into a dialkyl ether dioxolan compound, and then hydrolyzing the resultant dialkyl ether dioxolan compound. This diglycerin dialkyl ether is useful as an emulsifier, cleaner etc., and is preferably used as a component of cosmetic compositions. A cosmetic composition comprising the above 2,3 dialkoxypropyl glyceryl ether is also disclosed.
