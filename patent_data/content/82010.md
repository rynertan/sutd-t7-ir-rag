## Description
Support For a Closure Assembly This invention relates to a closure assembly, especially one suitable for use in the protection, splicing or insulation of supply lines such as electric cables, particularly for the telecommunications or power industries. Closure assemblies, especially ones having a shrinkable outer sleeve, are now widely used in many areas where insulation, sealing or encapsulation are required. Usually these sleeves recover, on heating or other treatment, towards an original shape from which they have previously been deformed, but we are also concerned with sleeves which adopt new configurations, even if they have not been previously deformed. Sleeves which shrink under the direct action of heat maybe made from a polymeric material exhibiting the property of elastic or plastic memory as described, for example, in US. Patents 2,027,962 3,086,242 and 3,957,372.In a variation of this idea, as described, for example, in British Patent 1,440,524, an elastomeric member such as an outer tubular member is held in a stretched state by a second member, such as an inner tubular hold out member, which, upon heating weakens and thus allows the elastomeric member to recover. In addition to tubular sleeves, wrap around sleeves with closures have also been developed e.g. as described in US Patents 3,379,218 and British Patents 1,155,470 1,211,988 and 1,346,479.Alternatively, the sheet may be held in the wrapped up configuration during recovery by means of an adhesive which may, in some cases, be applied on site. The disclosures of these patents and other patents and applications mentioned in this specification, are incorporated herein by reference. Q 1e o.trt area of application of articles of the type described above is in the insulation and protection of junctions between supply lines, especially electric zabi. In masking such junctions, for example, between telephone or power cables, many problems arise in meeting the necessary requirements of continuity of insulation and earthing, of sealing the joint against the ingress of contaminants such as moisture and insects and in providing the necessary strength of resistance to tension, compression, flexing and impact. British Patent 1,431,167 discloses one type of staling system, namely a heat shrinkable sleeve, which my be a wrap around sleeve, provided with a central reinforcement comprising longitudinally split tube.Typically such a tube is made from a pair of semicylindrical half shells, for example made from aluminium. An alternative idea, which is disclosed and claimed in our US Patent 4289553 is the use of an inner liner comprising a continuous thin metal foil provided with central reinforcing means comprising one or more longitudinally compressible coils. The assembly is re enterable since the heat shrinkable sleeve can be cutand removed and the coil s can be longitudinally compressed so as to allow access to the joint. Once repair or modification has been effected the coil s can return to ttieir former configuration. However, because of the coil arrangement the use of a knife to cut the heat ecoverable sleeve metal foil laminate is rather difficult since there is no continuous surface to support the tip of the knife. Also, this assembly tends to lack longitudinal strength. In Gebrauchsmuster 7805026 there is described an assembly having an insert formed from a roll of stiff moisture proof material having an internal aluminium foil liner, but this tends to suffer from capillary transfer along the outer surface of the liner and around the foil at its ends. Our co pending UK patent publication 2059873 discloses a liner which is a laminate of the following layers, starting from the outer surface Al foil, MYLAR polyester Reg. T.M , first pressboard, second pressboard, microporous MYLAR, and wax coating. Here the aluminium foil could be 10 bonded to the outer sleeve to prevent capillary transfer between them. Our UK Patent Publication 2069773 discloses a similar system, but based on a thermoplastics material rather than a cardboard. Recoverability is an advantage in such closure assemblies since it affords a quick and reliable way of sealing the ends of the assembly to the substrates. It is desirable therefore that end portions of the sleeve be recoverable, and in many cases the whole of the sleeve is recoverable. The reason for this may be due to preferred manufacturing techniques or, where the sleeve is wrap around, due to the way sealing is achieved between the abutting or overlapping longitudinal edges of the sleeve. It is necessary that a flap be provided in sealing engagement with the longitudinal edges, and recovery of the sleeve can ensure the requisite tightness. It is important to ensure that this flap is properly sealed against the inside of the abutting or overlapping portion of the sleeve. This is even more important in a form of wraparound sleeve where, instead of being formed integrally therewith, the flap is provided as a discrete sealing member. As mentioned above, the flap is provided in order to malnta n a seal between the two edges, particularly where the splice case is pressurised. A channel can be provided to hold together upstanding rails which project frcm edge portions of the sleeve. This channel provides the necessary clamping force to hold the rails together whilst the sleeve is recovered and any sealant present caused to melt and flow. When installation is complete the sealant in conjunction with the flap provides a barrier to pressure within the splice case and increases the leak path. In order for the flap to do its job properly it must be in tight contact with the sleeve at the base of the two rails, and thereby bridge the two rails. Where the sleeve is recoverable throughout its length, this tight contact can be ensured by the tension in the outer sleeve that results from its shrinkage when the outer sleeve shrinks it causes the flap to be squeezed between the base of the rails and a rigid internal support member which will generally be provided around the wire splices themselves. Where the sleeve is recoverable only dt its ends a special flap assembly such as that disclosed in our co pending UK application 8130392 will be required. This can lead to a problem of ensuring proper positioning of the sleeve relative to the special flap assembly. Where the closure assembly is to be used around a splice in pressurised cables it will have to withstand the pressure used in the cables, and as a result will have some special design features. The outer sleeve may be formed by moulding as disclosed in our UK Application 8132449, and v seals may be incorporated at the regions where the sleeve meets the substrates to aid pressure retention, as disclosed in UK Publication 2040106. One advantage of a pressurised system is that the whole of the sleeve need not be bonded to the internal support. In pressurised systems the internal support may be a canister formed of a sheet metal or plastics material, preferably aluminium. Alternatively it may be formed of end rings joined together by longitudinal members, and have a cage like apperance. In unpressurised systems, or in less rugged pressurised systems, the support may be a roll of material comprising layers acting as support, moisture vapour barrier and heat barrier. A support based on cardboard and a support based on a thermoplastics material were referred to above. A further feature of telecommunications and power cables that should be mentioned is their shielding layer. A shielding layer, which may be an aluminium tape or a copper braid etc., is provided around the cable bundle, but inside the outer jacket. In a splice between two cables it is necessary to provide some means of continuity between the shield on the two cables. One way of doing this is to use a wire with a crocodile clip at each end which can be clipped on to each cable shield to provide a bridge. Although this gives ground continuity, the splice itself is not shielded. Furthermore, where the cables are carried above ground it may be desirable that a series of drain points are provided along the cable from the shielding layer down to earth. This can prevent damage that may otherwise occur during lightning strikes. A modification to a support has now been designed which is particularly useful in pressurised systems where location of an outer sleeve or where pressure access is required. The modification will also be useful in other circumstances, such as where shielding drainage is required. Thus, the present invention provides an assembly suitable for enclosing a substrate, which comprises an inner support provided with an outwardly extending ppendage an outer see having a hole therein for cooperation with the appendage and means for sealing the sleeve to the substrate the appendage providing communication from the support to the outside of the assembly. The outer sleeve is preferably of a plastics material and the support is preferably a metal canister, more preferably one comprising two half shells supported by end pieces. The end pieces may comprise rings which support the half shells and longitudinally extending fingers which can be bent inwards to provide a gentle transition in the support so that the assembly can be used to enclose a cable splice, which has a bulky central portion between relatively thin cables. Instead of half shells, the support may comprise rods or bars, thus having a cage like appearance. Other supports include the paper or plastics arrangements described above. The outer sleeve is preferably recoverable generally heat shrinkable at its ends to ensure good sealing to the cables or other substrates. This recoverability may constitute the sole means of sealing the sleve to the substrate, however a coating of adhesive or clips such as jubilee clips are preferred The central portion is preferably dimensionally stable, since splitting may otherwise occur in the region of the hole. Furthermore good sealing around the hole could be difficult if the hole were in a recoverable portion. As it is, the appendage can carry a screw thread allowing a washer and nut to fix the sleeve to the support at that point, achieving a perfect pressure and environmental seal. The communication between the support and the outside of the assembly is important, and examples have been alluded to in the discussion above concerning some of the requirements of this type of closure assembly.Thus, communication can be, for example, electrical, gaseous or mechanical, or a combination of any of these.Mechanical communiation can mean simply location of the components of the assembly, or mechanical access to the inside of the assembly. c It has been proposed, see UK publication 1585154, to provide a valve on an outer sleeve for pressure access. Fixing a valve in the sleeve, however, cannot easily provide for proper location of the sleeve, or for an electrical access to the cable shielding. Also it would be desirable that the valve be located over a hole in the inner support, and this imposes a further requirement for location. A further point is that the valve, or other appendage, can be secured far more ruggedly if it is attached to the support than if it is attached to the plastics outer sleeve. As a result it could be used as a fixing or attachment point for the splice case to a support. Four instances of communication from inside the assembly to outside will be briefly summarised. The first is access to the shielding of the cables, mentioned above as being useful where the cables to be spliced are carried above ground. In the present system the continuity in shielding can be achieved by the support itself. If the support is a metal canister it will make electrical connection with exposed shielding at each cable and will surround the cable splice. The apeae, which may be interal with or attached to the support will be of electrically conducting material, and ean be connected to a drain wire which runs to earth. If deed, each splice case could be earthed in this way.This arangement avoids the need for additional parts su as shield continuity wires and clips. In fact no extra wires are needed at all, as would be the case if the appendage were on the outer sleeve. Assembly is easy the support is placed around the splice after stripping the cable jackets to expose the shielding, and the outer sleeve is installed. Shield continuity and a access are thus automatically achieved. Secondly, pressure input or access for measurement can be provided for. In this case the appendage need not be electrically conductive, but metal may in any case be the most suitable material. The appendage will of course be hollow, but it need not incorporate a valve since a separate valve could be attached to it. However, for most purposes, the appendage will simply be a valve which is attached to a hole in the support. Pressurised systems do not require a hot melt adhesive or sealant on the internal surface of the outer sleeve, so re entry will be simple. A further requirement of pressurised systems will generally be v seals, which are described below in connection with the drawings. A third use of the appendage is for mechanical communication to achieve proper orientation between the various components of the assembly. This may in some cases be the only use of the appendage but it will often be a beneficial side effect of the provision of a valve or of the electrical connector. The appendage fits in the hole in the sleeve thus locating the sleeve with respect to the support. This may be useful merely for ease of assembly, but it will be especially useful where the outer sleeve is of wrap around form, and the longitudinal edges of the sleeve have to be positioned over a flap assembly for proper sealing between them.The flap assembly can conveniently be stuck to the canister by the manufacturer or alernatively by the worker on site and as a result proper alignment of the sleeve with the canister results in its proper alignment with the flap assembly. Another instance where alignment may be desired is where a small cable branches from a large cable here it is desirable that. the rails of a wrap around sleeve lie over the larger cable. The fourth example is again mechanical. It may be desirable to secure the closure assembly to a post or other structure, either to aid assembly or for convenient or safe positioning during use. Attachment simply to the outer plastics sleeve or to the cables may cause damage, whereas with the present system secure attachment could be provided by bolting or otherwise attaching the rugged internal support directly to the external structure. The invention is further illustrated, by way of example, by the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is an exploded view showing the components of a support canister Figure 2 is a view of an assembled support canister Figure 3 shows a splice case to be re entered and Figure 4 is a cross section of a re entered splice case. The support illustrated is a canister made from sheet material, such as aluminium or a plastics material, although.a cage like structure could be used. The main part of the support comprises two half shells 1 , which slot together to form a tubular support which can be played around a cable splice and over which an outer lee can be installed. The support could, of course, be of one piece cylindrical design but it is better spa so that it can be installed around a cable splice iout disconnecting all of the wires. The method of joining the two half shells together is not critical, although it is of course desirably rigid and reliable. The two half shells can be permanently hinged together along one pair of longitudinal edges, the other pair simply abutting, or interengaging by means of appropriately located tabs. Alternatively, the half shells can be completely separated, as illustrated, and both pairs of loaitudinl edges optionally interengaging by means of tabs which can function as temporary hinges. Since it is desirable that the closure assembly, of which the canister forms an internal support, conforms well to the size and shape of the cable splice or other substrate to be protected, end pieces 3,4 are provided to provide a gentler transition from the larger splice to the smaller cables. As with the half shells 1 , the end pieces 3,lot are preferably split or in two pieces so that they can be wrapped around the substrate. They may be conical in shape or, as shown, they may comprise rings which run circumferentially at the ends of the half shells, and fingers 8 which extend longitudinally fro the rings and which can be bent inwards to provide the smooth transition in general a transition will be required at each end of the half shells but in Figure 1 onls7 one is shown. In the embodiment illustrated the end pieces 3,4 act as support for the half shells, and therefore fit inside the ends of the half shells. As a result the end pieces are provided with locating tabs 7 to ensure rigidity. Alternatively, the end pieces could fit around the outside of the half shells, in which case the half shells would desirably be provided with locating tabs, as mentioned above. Location of the half shells 1 with respect to the end pieces 3,4 is achieved by tabs 5 on the half shells and slots 6 in the end pieces 3,4 If desired, the tabs could be provided on the end piece and the slots in the half shells, although such an arrangement may have the disadvantage of presenting a rough surface to an outer sleeve due to the protruding tabs. One or more of the fingers 8 may be provided with a tie wrap 9 to hold the fingers down against the cable or other substrate. It was mentioned above that the canister of this invention could be used as a support for a pressurised system, and that such a system may employ a wrap around outer sleeve which is recoverable only at its ends and which therefore requires some means of forcing a sealing flap against the internal surface of the sleeve to seal its abutting or overlapping edges. Furthermore, some outer sleeves do not possess an integral flap, due to the way they are made, and as a result the flap has to be provided independently. It is this flap and sealing means as a unitary flap assembly which is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 at 14 and which is described more fully in our co pending UK Patent Application 8130392.In the drawings, the flap assembly 14 includes end v seals 15 which aid pressure retention at the regions where the closure assembly meets the substrate. The flap assembly 14 is bonded to one of the half shells and since the assembly must be properly located with respect to the outer sleeve, the problem reduces to locating the outer sleeve with respect to the half shells. It is this which can be achieved by means of the appendage 2 . The outer sleeve will have a hole in a central, heat stable part, through which the appendage 2 will fit, thus properly locating the longitudinal edges or rails of the sleeve over the flap assembly. The appendage may serve as a pressure inlet or access point in which case it will b hollow and preferably incorporate a valve .or it may be conductive to serve as a drain point for the cable shielding the half shells themselves providing shield continity between the cables to be spliced. The last feature will often be useful where the system concerned is an overground cable connection which could be subjected to lightening strikes. The appendage may be positioned and constructed to fulfill any one or more of these functions, and in any case it may have an external screw thread over which can be put a washer and a nut for providing a seal. In Figure 2 the canister is shown assembled. The two half shells are held together by small pieces of tapes 12 , which can easily be removed to separate the half shells in order to position them around the cable splice. The tapes 12 can then be replaced. Further tapes 13 are shown securing the half shells to the end pieces, although the system of tabs 5 and slots 6 is sufficiently good that these tapes 13 are generally not required. It will be appreciated that where tapes 13 are used they will preferably be broken at the joints in the half shells to enable the half shells to be separated. The half shells are preferably of such a size or design that when assembled a gap 11 remains between them. The purpose of gap 11 is to enable a screwdriver to be used to separate the half shells on re entry. Figure 2 shows foam blocks 10 secured to some of the fingers 8 . Where the canister is to be used around a cable branch off, a branch off clip will desirably be used to ensure a proper seal between the outer sleeve and the diverging cables, and the purpose of the foam blocks 10 is to ensure intimate contact of the sleeve at the tip of the clip. Figure 3 shows in perspective view a cable splice case, and a way of re entering it. Cables 16 are joined and enclosed by an outer sleeve 18 which is of the wraparounnd type, opposed longitudinal edges bearing rails and being held together by a channel 17 . This method cf cir.ir.g is disclosed in our UK Patent 1155470. The end portions cf tne sleeve can be seen to taper from the larger dia nCter of the splice to the smaller diameter of the cables. As mentioned above, this larger central portion may be unexpanded and therefore remain heat stable only the end portions shrinking during assembly. The central portion has a hole through which protrudes the appendage 2 . Since the hole is in a heat stable part sealing is simple and may be effected by a washer and nut. Re entry may be carried out as follows.First, the washer and nut are removed, and rail and channel 17 are removed from the central portion by sawing. Then cuts are made in the sleeve, following the dotted lines 19 , allowing a central portion of the sleeve to be removed.In a pressurised system it is generally not necessary to provide an adhesive bond between the outer sleeve and the canister to prevent capillary transfer between the two, and as a result the sleeve can be removed cleanly from the canister. Where such a bond is required, re entry can be made easier by employing one of the methods disclosed in our co pending UK Patent Application 8102931. In the situation referred to the sleeve will be able to be removed from the canister cold, but if no sucgh provision has been made it may be necessary to heat the splice case to soften any adhesive present. After the sleeve has been removed, a screwdriver is used to spearate the half shells. After the splice has been attended to a new sleeve is installed around the old canister and the butts of the old splice case. In a pressurised system new v seals will probably be needed at the regions where the new outer sleeve will meet the butts of the old sleeve. In general a new flap assembly 14 will not be needed, although for ease of assembly the new v seals may form part of a flap v seal assembly. Figure 4 shows in cross section a re entered splice case which is being re built. A central portion of the sleeve has been removed leaving two butts 20 . The butts still carry a part of the rail and channel 17 , the remainder having been sawed off as a preliminary to removing the central portion of the sleeve. Inside the butt can be seen the original v seals 15 for pressure retention. The v seals work by presenting to the pressure within the splice case a concave surface so that the adhesive between the sleeve 20 and the cables 16 is not put in peel by the pressure. The canister 1 is shown partly in place around the splice bundle 21 , although the end pieces are omitted for clarity. The end pieces could remain embedded in the butts 20 of the old sleeve, the design of the canister allowing the half shells to be removed for inserting without disturbing the end pieces. When the splice case is to be re built, further v seals 15A are installed around the butts 20 of the old sleeve. These new v seals 15A have the usual function of putting the adhesive which will bond the new outer sleeve out of peel, but they are also useful in eliminating hoop stress in those regions of the butts 20 which no longer have a rail and channel 17 . This latter effect can be explained as follows. Pressure in the re built splice case will operate inside the old v seals 15 to cause the butts 20 to open out at their. cylindrical portions where there is no longer a rail and channel. This would put the adhesive in that region into creep. The presence of a new v seal 15A over the top of this portion, however, gives rise when the system is pressurised to a contractive force on the butts 20 which cancels the expansive force caused by pressure in the old v seals 15 . As a result there is no nett hoop stress on the butts 20 , and the system is therefore stable.
