## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION 2 SULFAMOYL lH INDOLE DERIVATIVES FOR THETREATMENT OF ELEVATED INTRAOCULAR PRESSURESUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel 2 sulfamoyllH indoles which are useful in the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure. More particularly this invention relates to compounds having the structural formula EMI1.1 wherein R, X and Y are as hereinafter defined, as well as the pharmaceutically and ophthalmologically acceptable salts thereof. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions for systemic and ophthalmic use employing a novel compound of this invention as active ingredient for the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure, especially when accompanied by pathological damage such as in the disease known as glaucoma.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Glaucoma is an ocular disorder associated with elevated intraocular pressures which are too high for normal function and may result in irreversible loss of visual function. If untreated, glaucoma may eventually lead to blindness. Ocular hypertension, i.e., the condition of elevated intraocular pressure without optic nerve head damage or characteristic glaucomatous visual field defects, is now believed by many ophthalmologists to represent the earliest phase of glaucoma. Many of the drugs formerly used to treat glaucoma proved not entirely satisfactory. Indeed, few advances were made in the treatment of glaucoma since pilocarpine and physostigmine were introduced.Only recently have clinicians noted that many ss adrenergic blocking agents are effective in reducing intraocular pressure. While many of these agents are effective in reducing intraocular pressure, they also have other characteristics, e.g membrane stabilizing activity, that are not acceptable for chronic ocular use. S l tert Butylamino 3 4 morpholino l,2,5 thiadiazol 3 yl oxy 2 propanol, a ss adrenergic blocking agent, was found to reduce intraocular pressure and to be devoid of many unwanted side effects associated with pilocarpine and, in addition, to possess advantages over many other ss adrenergic blocking agents, e.g. to be devoid of local anesthetic properties, to have a long duration of activity, and to display minimal tolerance. Although pilocarpine, physostigmine and the blocking agents mentioned above reduce intraocular pressure, none of these drugs manifests its action by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase and, thereby, impeding the contribution to aqueous humor formation made by the carbonic anhydrase pathway. Agents referred to as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, block or impede this inflow pathway by inhibiting the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase. While such carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are now used to treat intraocular pressure by oral, intravenous or other systemic routes, they thereby have the distinct disadvantage of inhibiting carbonic anhydrase throughout the entire body. Such a gross disruption of a basic enzyme system is justified only during an acute attack of alarmingly elevated intraocular pressure, or when no other agent is effective.Despite the desirability of directing the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor only to the desired ophthalmic target tissue, no topically effective carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are available for clinical use. However, typically effective carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are reported in European Patent applications 0,070,239 and 0,079,269 and U.S. application, Serial No. 364,953. The compounds reported therein are 5 and 6 hydroxy 2 benzothiazolesulfonamides and acyl esters thereof. To be an effective and acceptable topical agent, an ophthalmic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor must not only penetrate the ophthalmic tissues to reach the active sites within the eye, but it must also be devoid of those side effects including irritation, allergic reaction and the like which would militate against long term administration.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The novel compounds of this invention have the structuralEMI4.1 or an ophthalmologically or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein X is hydrogen, halo, such as chloro, bromo or fluoro,C1 3alkyl, hydroxy or C1 3alkoxy andY is hydrogen or C13 alkyl R is 1 hydroxy, 2 Ra wherein Ra is ar C1 18 alkyl either straight or branched chain and substituted with one or more of i C36 cycloalkyl, ii halo, such as chloro, bromo or fluoro, iii aryl, wherein the aryl group is carbocyclic such as phenyl or naphthyl, or heterocyclic such as pyridinyl, furanyl, pyrazinyl, morpholinyl, oxazolinyl, dioxolinonyl, imidazolyl, thienyl or the like and wherein the aryl group can be substituted with one or more of C1 10 alkyl, halo, C14 alkoxy or C25 alkanoyl, iv hydroxy, v C1 3 alkoxy, vi aryl C1 3 alkoxy, vii amino, viii C1 3 alkyl amino, ix di C1 3 alkyl amino,EMI5.1 wherein R2 is 1 HO , 2 M O , wherein M is a pharmaceutically acceptable cation such as that from an alkali metal, or an ammonium, 3 C1 10 alkoxy, 4 R R4N wherein R3 and R4 are independently hydrogen, C1 15 alkyl, or taken together form a 3 7 membered heterocycle with the nitrogen to which they are attached such as piperidino r pyrrolidino b C3 6 cycloylkyl, c C1 18 alkyl C3 6 cycloalkyl, d aryl as previously defined, e C26 alkenyl, f aryl C2 6 alkenyl, g C2 6 alkynyl, 3 RaÚ O ,EMI6.1 wherein RÚ is RaÚ or C1 18EMI6.2 wherein x is 0 2 y is 0 3 z is 0 or 1 and A is a heteroatom such as S, O, or N,EMI6.3 where R5 and R6 are independently a hydrogen, b C1 18 alkyl, either straight or branched chain, c C3 6 cycloalkyl, d C3 6 cycloalkyl C1 3 alkyl, e aryl C1 3 alkyl wherein the aryl group is either unsubstituted or substituted with one or more of chloro, bromo, fluoro, C1 3 alkyl or C1 3 alkoxy, EMI7.1 wherein R7is i C1 18 alkyl, either straight or branched chain, ii aryl, either unsubstituted or substituted with one or more of chloro, bromo, fluoro, C1 3 alkyl, or C13 alkoxy, iii aryl C1 3 alkyl wherein the aryl group is either unsubstituted or substituted with one or more of chloro, bromo, fluoro, C1 3 alkyl or C13 alkoxy, iv amino C1. 18 alkyl either straight or branched chain or g R5 and R if lower alkyl, are joined together directly or through a heteroatom selected from 0 or N to form a 5 or 6 membered heterocycle with the nitrogen to which they are attached such as pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, or piperazine.EMI7.2 whereinM is an ophthalmologically acceptable cation selected from sodium, potassium ammonium, tetra C1 qalkyl ammonium, pyridinium, imidazolium, pralidoxime, and thiamine EMI8.1 wherein M is as previously defined a 11 M O P O , wherein R8 is C13 alkyl or OR8 phenyl C13 alkyl orEMI8.2 wherein R8 is as previously defined, and the two may be the same or different andR and X joined together represent methylenedioxy.

The novel process for preparing the compounds wherein R is hydroxy comprises treatment of a methoxy 2 sulfamoyl lH indole with at least an equimolar amount of pyridine hydrochloride at a temperature from about the fusion point to about 2000C, and preferably from about 1600 1700C for from about 0.25 to 4 hours, preferably about 0.5 hour, until the reaction is substantially complete. The novel process to prepare those compounds wherein R isEMI14.1 is represented by the following reaction scheme EMI14.2 where R1 has the meanings hereinbefore designated, and X1 is chloro, bromo, iodo, EMI14.3 EMI14.4 Generally equimolar amounts of the hydroxy 2 sulfamoyl IH indoleEMI14.5 are employed, although use of an excess of the more readily available reactant is satisfactory. The reaction is conducted in a suitable, inert solvent such as acetone, dimethylformamide, pyridine, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran or benzene and the like with at least an equimolar amount of a hydrohalide acceptor when the acylating agent is an acyl halide or with a carboxylic acid acceptor when the acylating agent is an acid anhydride. Bases such as triethylamine, pyridine and the like may be employed for this purpose. The reaction may be conducted with or without a catalyst at temperatures of from OOC to the boiling point of the solvent used but preferably from about 150C to 500C. When a catalyst is employed, a 4,4 dialkylaminopyridine such as 4 dimethylaminopyridine or 4 pyrrolidinopyridine is preferred.The compounds wherein R isEMI15.1 this invention are most suitably prepared by reacting the compoundEMI15.2 with an appropriate haloformate, particularly a chloroformate of the formula EMI15.3 or a bis carbonate of the formula EMI15.4 The reaction is conducted in a suitable solvent such as dimethylformamide, pyridine, acetone, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran or benzene and the like with at least an equimolar amount of a hydrohalide acceptor. Bases such as triethylamine, pyridine and the like may be employed for this purpose. The reaction may be conducted with or without a catalyst at temperatures of from OOC to the boiling point of the solvent used but preferably from 150C to 500C. When a catalyst is employed, triethylamine or a 4,4 dialkylaminopyridine such as 4 dimethylaminopyridine or 4 pyrrolidinopyridine is preferred. In the novel process of this invention for preparing the ethers of hydroxy 2 sulfamoyl lHindole, the hydroxy compound is treated with an alkylating agent of formula R1 X2 wherein X2 is a halide such as chloride, bromide or iodide, or other good leaving group such as mesylate, tosylate or benzenesulfonate in a suitable solvent such as dimethyl formamide, hexamethyl phosphoramide, or the like in the presence of a base such as an alkali metal alkoxide, preferably sodium methoxide, at about OOC to 350C, usually about room temperature for about 10 to 30 hours. An alternate synthesis of ethers comprises protecting the sulfonamide group as an N,Ndisubstituted formamidine which is removed after formation of the desired ether. The formamidine derivative is prepared by adding, for example, N,N dimethylformamide dimethylacetal to a suspension of the hydroxy 2 sulfamoyl lH indole in an inert organic solvent such as acetonitrile at about 10 to 35 C, preferably room temperature for about 0.5 to about 3 hours. The ethers are then readily prepared by treating the hydroxy compound with the alkylating agent, R1 X2, in a solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide, preferably in the presence of an acid acceptor such as potassium carbonate or the like, pyridine or the like or basic ion exchange resin. The reaction is conducted at about 25 to 1000C, preferably about 600C, for about 10 to 36 hours, preferably about 18 hours. The protecting groupies then removed from the sulfonamide by treating the compound with dilute alkali such as 2 N sodium hydroxide at about 20 to 60 C, preferably about 400C for about 0.5 to 3 hours, preferably about 1 hour. Also, 6N HC1 at about 1000C for 2 5 hours can be used to effect the desired deprotection. The novel compounds of this invention with no substituent, i.e. R H and those carrying fairly stable substituents such as wherein R is R1 andR1 is alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkyl alkyl, alkylcycloalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, alkenyl R is R1 Owherein R1 is as defined above R is R5R6 Nwherein R5 and R6 are not hydrogen are conveniently prepared by formation of the sulfonamide group on the intact indole moiety in which the indole N is protected. This is accomplished by the procedure described earlier for preparation of methoxy 2sulfamoylindoles. The O sulfates of this invention are prepared by reacting an hydroxy 2 sulfamoyl lH indole with sulfamic acid in pyridine at elevated temperatures about 500 to the boiling point for about 18 to 48 hours to provide the ammonium salt followed, if desired, by titration with hydroxides of the formulaMOH to provide the other salts. Similarly the O phosphates of this invention are prepared by treatment of a hydroxy 2 sulfamoyllH indole with phosphorus oxychloride, an alkyl dichlorophosphate or a dialkyl chlorophosphate in pyridine or similar basic solvent at about 5 to 50C for about 0.25 to 1.0 hour.

For use in treatment of conditions relieved by the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, the active compound can be administered either systemically, or, in the treatment of the eye, topically. The dose administered can be from as little as 0.1 to 25 mg or more per day, singly, or preferably on a 2 to 4 dose per day regimen although a single dose per day is satisfactory. When administered for the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure or glaucoma, the active compound is most desirably administered topically to the eye, although systemic treatment is, as indicated, also possible. When given systemically, the drug can be given by any route, although the oral route is preferred. In oral administration the drug can be employed in any of the usual dosage forms such as tablets or capsules, either in a contemporaneous delivery or sustained release form. Any number of the usual excipients or tableting aids can likewise be included. When given by the topical route, the active drug or an ophthalmologically acceptable salt thereof such as the sodium or potassium salt is formulated into an ophthalmic preparation. In such formulations, from 0.1 to 15 by weight can be employed. The objective is to administer a dose of from 0.1 to 10 mg per eye per day to the patient, with treatment continuing so long as the condition persists. Thus, in an ophthalmic sol tion, insert, ointment or suspension for topical delivery, or a tablet, intramuscular, or intravenous composition for systemic delivery, the active medicament or an equivalent amount of a salt thereof is employed, the remainder being carrier, excipients, preservatives and the like as are customarily used in such compositions. The active drugs of this invention are most suitably administered in the form of ophthalmic pharmaceutical compositions adapted for topical administration to the eye such as a suspension, ointment, or as a solid insert. Formulations of these compounds may contain from 0.01 to 15 and especially 0.5 to 2 of medicament. Higher dosages as, for example, about 10 , or lower dosages can be employed provided the dose is effective in reducing or controlling elevated intraocular pressure. As a unit dosage from between 0.001 to 10.0 mg, preferably ,Od5 to 2.0 mg, and especially 0.1 to 1.0 mg of the compound is generally applied to the human eye, generally on a daily basis in single or divided doses so long as the condition being treated exists. These hereinbefore described dosage values are believed accurate for human patients and are based on the known and presently understood pharmacology of the compounds, and the action of other similar entities in the human eye. They reflect the best mode known. As with all medications, dosage requirements are variable and must be individualized on the basis of the disease and the response of the patient. The pharmaceutical preparation which contains the active compound may be conveniently admixed with a non toxic pha naceutical organic carrier, or with a non toxic pharmaceutical inorganic carrier. Typical of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are, for example, water, mixtures of water and water miscible solvents such as lower alkanols or aralkanols, vegetable oils, polyalkylene glycols, petroleum based jelly, ethyl cellulose, ethyl oleate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, isopropyl myristate and other conventionally employed acceptable carriers.The pharmaceutical preparation may also contain non toxic auxiliary substances such as emulsifying, preserving, wetting agents, bodying agents and the like, as for example, polyethylene glycols 200, 300, 400 and 600, carbowaxes 1,000, 1,500, 4,000, 6,000 and 10,000, antibacterial components such as quaternary ammonium compounds, phenylmercuric salts known to have cold sterilizing properties and which are non injurious in use, thimerosal, methyl and propyl paraben, benzyl alcohol, phenyl ethanol, buffering ingredients such as sodium chloride, sodium borate, sodium acetates, gluconate buffers, and other conventional ingredients such as sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine, oleate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitylate, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, monothioglycerol, thiosorbitol, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, and the like.Additionally, suitable ophthalmic vehicles can be used as carrier media for the present purpose including conventional phosphate buffer vehicle systems, isotonic boric acid vehicles, isotonic sodium chloride vehicles, isotonic sodium borate vehicles and the like. The pharmaceutical preparation may also be in the form of a solid insert such as one which after dispensing the drug remains essentially intact, or a bio erodible insert that either is soluble in lacrimal fluids, or otherwise disintegrates.
