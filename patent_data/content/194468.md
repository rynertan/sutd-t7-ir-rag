# ELECTRONIC SELECTOR SWITCH FOR THE SELECTION AND EVENTUAL DAMPING OF RADIO AND TELEVISION FREQUENCIES

## Abstract
An electronic selector 1 for the selection and eventual attenuation of radio and television frequencies, preferably operating on the 40 200 MHz band and utilizable for the reception of radio and television signals broadcasted either by ether or cable, containing two or more 23 chains, constituted by one or more 3 PIN diodes placed in series, which connect the RF 4 inputs to output 5. Every 4 input is connected to a source of RF signals and the 5 output to the input of a utilizer set. The 23 chains are fed in turn by equal or different voltages, both positive and negative, through one or more inputs 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 and 21 or through output 5, to each chain feed corresponds the commutation of the relative 4 input with the 5 output and the interdiction of all the other outputs. The commutation current of the various 4 inputs is weak and polarizes the other 23 chains with exclusion of the relative 4 entries.
