# 1,6 NAPHTHYRIDIN 2 1H ONES HAVING CARDIOTONIC ACTIVITY AND PREPARATION

## Abstract
5 1H 5 membered N aromatic heteryl 1 yl 7 R 1,6 naphthyridin 2 1H ones formula I or salts thereof are useful as cardiotonic agents. Also shown as intermediates are 5 X 7 R 1,6 naphthyridin 2 1H ones formula II or salts thereof, where X is bromo, chloro or hydrazino, 2 2 di lower alkylamino ethenyl 1,6 dihydro 6 oxo 3 pyridinecarbonitrile formula III , and 2 2 di lower alkylamino 1 propenyl 6 methoxy 3 pyridinecarbonitrile formula IIIa . Processes shown include the preparation of I from II, preparation of II from III or IIIa and the preparation of III from 1,6 dihydro 2 methyl 6 oxo 3 pyridinecarbonitrile, and the preparation of IIIa from 6 methoxy 2 methyl 3 pyridinecarbonitrile.
