# Fluid dispensing device.

## Abstract
A nozzle for fitment to hand actuated liquid pumps having a barrel portion 20 with a bore 22 therethrough for passage of a liquid is disclosed. The nozzle features an integrally formed nozzle cap 30 which is mounted to the barrel and which encloses an integrally formed sealing structure. The sealing structure 38 provides a peripheral seal to provide a liquid tight seal around the barrel between the nozzle cap and the barrel. The sealing structure also provides a check valve portion 46 which is movably positioned at the mouth of the bore. The check valve is biased to form a liquid tight bore seal. This bore seal is overcome by liquid pressure which builds in the bore upon actuation of the pump. Also pro vided is a spray means 62 which is fittable within the nozzle cap and wich is in abutment with the end wall of the nozzle cap. The spray means, along with the wall of the nozzle cap which it abuts, form a path for the liquid as it is dispensed, which path will cause the liquid to break up and form a spray pattern.
