# Darlington transistor pair units.

## Abstract
A Darlington transistor pair unit comprising a Darlington transistor pair enclosed in a solid resin enclosure 3 and having external connection terminals 11,12,13,14 mounted on a stepped surface 35,36,37,38 of the enclosure 3 said stepped surface 35,36,373,38 being shaped to provide two relatively raised surface portions 35,36 alternating with two relatively lower surface portions 37,38 first and second external connection terminals 11,12 for the collector and emitter of the second stage transistor being mounted re spectively on said relatively raised surface portions 35,36 a third external connection terminal 13 for the emitter of the first stage transistor being mounted on the relatively lower surface portion 37 between said raised surface portions 35,36 and a fourth external connection terminal 14 for the base of the first stage being mounted on the other lower surface portion 38 which is at an outer side of said stepped surface. Two such units can be interconnected in a simple manner by means of mutually parallel conductors extending along the aligned surface portions of the two units thereby avoiding any connection cross over problems and being readily mountable on a printed circuit board while being capable of providing adequate inter terminal insulation distances with no increase in external size over prior art units.
