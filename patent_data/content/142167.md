# LEVEL SHIFTING CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A level shifting circuit for level shifting an input signal so as to correspond with the operating level of a logic circuit of the next stage. The level shifting circuit comprises a first CMOS inverting amplifier circuit A₁ without provision of a feedback loop and a second CMOS inverting amplifier circuit A₂ whose output is coupled to the input through a low impe dance element L1 , either the input or the output of the sec ond amplifier circuit A₂ being connected to the input of the first amplifier circuit A₁ . The second amplifier circuit A₂ functions as an auto bias circuit with respect to the first amp lifier circuit A₁ . The level shifting circuit thus formed makes it possible to remarkably reduce power consumption and occu pation area when configured as an integrated circuit.
