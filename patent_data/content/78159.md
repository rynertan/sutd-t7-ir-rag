# Electric traction current collector.

## Abstract
An electric traction current collector, such as is de scribed in United Kingdom Patent Specification No. 1 374 972, has a carbon current collector block 1 housing a rupturable tubular container 7 for air under pressure applied through a pneumatic control system for a panto graph or other carrier so that loss of air pressure due to rupture of the container causes the current collector block to be retracted. The container 7 is so thin that, if it is not completely housed and supported, it bursts under the applied air pressure and consequently any defect in the carbon block which spoils complete support of the container causes retraction of the current collector.
