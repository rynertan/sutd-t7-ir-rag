# Electron image tube having a trapping space for loose particles.

## Abstract
For the trapping of any loose particles remaining in the envelope of an electron image tube after manufacture or subsequently formed therein, the envelope has a trapping space 49 or 50 which is readily accessible to the loose par ticles but wherefrom the loose particles can escape only with great difficulty, and which is such that particles trapped therein will not substantially adversely affect normal opera tion of the tube. The entrance of the trapping space suitably is a funnel like slit 46 or 48 directed towards the interior of the trapping space 49 or 50 . The trapping space 49, 50 is preferably in a region of the envelope free of strong fields in normal operation of the tube.
