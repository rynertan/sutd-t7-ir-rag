Detailed DescriPtion of the Invention The process of the present invention provides a convenient process for preparing rinantadine in high yields from l adanantanecarbonitrile according to the following reaction scheme EMI3.1 tb SEP CH3 SEP N tb SEP SEP CH3M SEP ether tb SEP NH2 tb SEP Bimantadine tb Reducin SEP SEP SEP HC1 SEP SEP Hydrochloride tb Agent SEP P tb The starting carbonitrile is available commercially or can be prepared according to any procedure known in the art. A key to the present process is the carbanion attack of the carbonitrile group using an organometallic reagent CH3M where M is lithium or MgX wherein X is Br or C1. The negatively charged methyl moiety attacks the electropositive carbon center of the carbonitrile group to generate an intermediate imino compound. The organometallics are commercially available or the Grignard reagents may be generated in situ from a methyl halide and magnesium. Methyllithium is the preferred organometallic for the high yield and short reaction time possible, however, due to the pyrophoric nature of methyllithium, methylmagnesium bromide is also preferred for its ease of handling. Any liquid ether can be used as a solvent in which to carry out the organometallic reaction. Mixed ether hydrocarbon solvent systems. such as tetrahydrofuran toluene, can also be used as solvent for the organometallic reaction. Diethyl ether is preferred due to the generally excellent yields obtained however, tetrahydrofuran is also preferred because of its higher boiling point. Other ethers that can be used include saturated aliphatic ethers such as methyl ether, methyl ethyl ether, ethyl propyl ether, i propyl ether and n propyl ether cyclic ethers such as ethylene oxide, and the propylene oxides diethers and triethers such as methyl, acetal, dioxan, and trioxymethylene and aromatic ethers such as anisole, phenetole, phenyl ether, benzyl ether, and naphthyl ether.The organometallic reaction is conducted at a temperature in the range of 20 C to the reflux temperature of the solvent. A temperature of O C to 250C is preferred. The intermediate imino compound is reduced to rimantadine free base by any of a number of well known reducing agents. Reduction with lithium aluminum hydride or with hydrogen in the presence of a platinum on carbon catalyst are preferred. Lithium aluminum Sydride is particularly preferred, especially when the reduction is carried out in the same ether solvent as the initial step of the process. When lithium aluminum hydride is employed as the reducing agent, it can be added directly to the cooled reaction mixture from the organonetallic reaction and the mixture is then heated to reflux. When catalytic hydrogenation is employed, the organometallic reaction is quenched by addition of a protic solvent, e.g. an alcohol such as ethanol, and concentrated.The concentrate is diluted with a protic solvent, preferably the same protic solvent used in the quench, and a catalyst such as 5 Pt C is added. The hydrogenation is conducted at a hydrogen pressure of 25 to 115 psia 170 790 kPa at room temperature. The preferred platinum on carbon catalyst used in the reduction step can be any of the many wellknown such catalysts. While the particular composition of the catalyst is not believed to be critical, a particularly useful catalyst has been found to be 5 by weight platinum metal on carbon black particles sold by Johnson Matthey Inc. under the name Type 18MA. In general, such catalysts may contain about 2 to 20S by weight platinum on carbon based on the total weight of catalyst. The invention can be further understood by reference to the following examples in which parts and percentages are by weight and temperature in degreesCentigrade. ExamPle 1 A small, round bottomed reaction flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a condenser with a packed drying tube, an addition funnel and a thermometer was flushed with nitrogen. Into the flask was placed 6.4 g of l adamantanecarbonitrile and 120 ml anhydrous ethyl ether. The solution was stirred and cooled to 0 109. An ethyl ether solution of methyl lithium 40 ml 1.55M was added dropwise with stirring and cooling to maintain the temperature under 100. After 30 minutes of stirring at this temperature, the cooling bath was removed and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature over one hour. Lithium aluminum hydride, 3.5 g, was added to the stirring mixture and the mixture was ref fluxed for approximately 2 1 2 hours, and allowed to cool to room temperature. To the stirred mixture was added 4 ml of water, 12 ml of 15 sodium hydroxide and 4 al of water consecutively. An exothermic reaction ensued and subsided after completion of the final water addition. The mixture was diluted with small amounts of ethyl ether and the layers were separated. The ether layer was first dried with potassium hydroxide pellets and then anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The drying agents were each removed by filtration and HC1 gas was bubbled into the clear ether solution of rimantadine free base. A white precipitate was collected and dried under vacuum to give 7.8 g of rimantadine hydrochloride in 90.7 yield.

Stirring was commenced and a clear solution resulted. The solution was cooled to O lOe and 10.4 ml 2.9 molar ratio of methyl magnesium bromide in THF was added dropwise at this temperature over 40 minutes. The cooling was removed and the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature over 3 hours. The mixture was again cooled to 5 100 and 1.75 g of lithium aluminum hydride was added. The mixture was then ref fluxed for two hours, and allowed to cool to room temperature. Water, 2 ml, followed by 6 ml 15 NaOH solution was added. After adding another 2 ml of water, the mixture was extracted with small portions of THF. The combined TIW solution was dried with potassium hydroxide pellets and then magnesium sulfate.

At 0 10 , 20 ml of 1.55 M methyl lithium was added dropwise over 45 minutes. The solution was allowed to warm to 15 over 20 minutes.Then, 50 ml of ethanol was added dropwise between 10 15v. An exothermic reaction took place with concommitant release of gas. The ethanol solution was concentrated under vacuum to give a crude viscous oil. The oil was dissolved in 200 ml of ethanol and transferred to aParr hydrogenation flask. Catalyst, 1.0 g 5 Pt C was added to the flask and the flask purged with hydrogen.The hydrogenation was conducted at 30 psi 344 KPa pressure and at room temperature overnight. The catalyst was removed by filtration and washed with a small portion of ethyl ether. The combined organic layer was concentrated under vacuum and the resultant liquid was dissolved in ethyl ether.Hydrogen chloride gas was bubbled into the ether solution of rimantadine free base and a white solid precipitated. The white solid was collected by filtration to give 2.4 g of rimantadine hydrochloride 56S yield . ExamPle 4 In a small, round bottomed reaction flask equipped with a stirrer, a condenser with a packed drying tube, an addition funnel and a thermometer was placed 3.2 g of l adamantanecarbonitrile.
