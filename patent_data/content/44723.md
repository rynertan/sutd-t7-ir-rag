# A PROCESS FOR THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF HYBRID PLANTS AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION OF HYBRID SEED

## Abstract
Hybrid plants and seeds are produced in increased yields. The process combines the techniques of sexual reproduction to develop new hybrids and seeds, and cloning of original parent plants to provide large scale replication of the original crosses. New hybrid seed varieties can be developed and readied for market in as little as three years, compared to the conventional eight to twelve years normally required for commercial production. Plant breeders are no longer limited to using homozygous parents in the produc tion of new plant hybrids. The process provides a special advantage in the production of increased yields of high purity Brassica seeds. In this instance cloning parents that are maximally self incompatible results in a parental line consisting of cloned plants that are essentially sib incompatible thus, the process eliminates the difficulties of conventional methods which require bud pollination to maintain sib incompatible parent lines through inbreeding.
