# A method of manufacturing a fabric having soil release properties, particularly forming fabrics used in papermaking machines and cellulose machines, and filter cloths used in the papermaking and cellulose industries and related industries.

## Abstract
A method of improving the soil repellant properties of fabrics such as forming fabrics used in papermaking and cellulose machines, and filter cloths used in papermaking and cellulose industries and related industries. The improvement in accord ance with the invention is obtained in that the synthetic material from which these fabrics are manufactured, is given improved hydrophilic properties, which in turn is achieved in that the synthetic starting material, prior to being extruded, is mixed with polymers which are made up of monomers having hydrolizable side groups. The fabric manufactured from the synthetic material is treated in a manner known per se with strong bases and or acids to hydrolize the side groups.
