# Acousto optical modulator.

## Abstract
An acousto optical modulator comprising an interaction medium 21 and a transducer 23, 24 on one face of the inter action medium. The transducer 23, 24 is optically isolated from the interaction medium 21 by an optical isolation layer 22 . Electrical signals are applied to create a periodic alternat ing strain field 30 within the transducer. This field is transmit ted into the interaction medium 21 to create a shallow strain diffraction grating at a modulating surface 22 . A light beam 26 is projected so as to undergo a total internal reflection at this modulating surface, a portion of the light 26 being selec tively diffracted out of the incident beam.
