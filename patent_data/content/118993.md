## Description
Process for printing onto polypropylene This invention relates to a process for printing onto polypropylene or any other plastics material with similar surface characteristics to polypropylene, which is normally considered unsuitable to accept printing inks satisfactorily, due to its grease like surface. The problem of printing onto polypropylene or similar material is that there is inadequate adhesion between the ink and the surface of polypropylene sheet resulting in poor definition and increasing repetitive inconsistency during and even after drying of the inks. To attempt to solve the problem of adhesion, a number of materials have been added to the ink, such additives also serving other purposes such as providing a nonrub finish or improving drying characteristics of the ink. Up to the present none of these have been found to be satisfactory and it is generally considered that it is not possible to print reliably onto polypropylene or other similar plastics material0 The object of this invention is therefore to provide a process for printing successfully onto polypropylene or other plastics material having similar surface characteristics to polypropylene0 According to the present invention there is provided a process for printing onto polypropylene or other plastics material having similar surface characteristics comprising printing, using normal inks, onto the polyprop ylene or other plastics surface and then coating the surface and the inked area with a transparent sealant material. According to a further aspect there is provided a sealant material for application to a surface of a polypropylene member or other plastics material having similar surface characteristics, characterised by a mixture of a non rub material and a hard dry material Conveniently, in one example the sealant material comprises 20 2596 weight of a non rub material and 20 25 by weight of a hard dry material and 5n 6096 by weight of a gloss varnish material. In another example the sealant material may com prise 60 8596 by weight of a non rub material and 15 4096 by weight of a hard dry material. Preferably the sealant material includes a nonrub paste comprising 30 to 35 by weight of a polythene type wax and 65 to 70 by weight of a quick setting varnish to make up the balance. Typically the optimum proportions of these materials comprise 354 of the polythene type wax and 66Âµ of the varnish0 An additive in the form of a hard dry material is preferably used. This may comprise 2 by weight of cobalt driers, 10 by weight of a wax compound and 88 by weight of china wood oil resin. Preferably the gloss varnish material where used and which serves as a carrier and results in a gloss finish, comprises a resin base with an oil solvent. Conveniently the ink is allowed to dry, at least partially before application of the sealant material. It is found desirable to apply the sealant material at a temperature between 500 and 600 Centigrade, to aid drying. The materials chosen include the characteristics, in the case of the non rub material of providing a non rub surface finish and in the case of the hard dry additive of a hard drying finish and in the case of the gloss varnish, where used, a good gloss surface. The invention will now be described by way of example. The process is particularly for printing onto polypropylene sheting but is also useful for printing onto similar materials which are normally considered impossible to print directly using conventional printing inks. Articles such as cassette packages or the cassettes themselves made from polypropylene material may also be printed by means of this process. The procedure involves printing by any conventional method using conventional inks onto the polypropylene surface. A colour or combination of colours can be applied in exactly the same way as these are applied normally to paper or other materials0 The printing inks are allowed to dry to a predetermined extent and then the whole surface including the printing area is coated with a sealant material0 This is transparent and the film of the sealant material laid down is very thin and therefore substantially indiscernible in the finished article. The sealant material may be applied using a roller or by spraying. Alternatively a rubber or other flexible blanket or other conventional means for applying a thin coating to the surface may be used. In one example the sealant material comprises a non rub paste with an additive in the form of a hard dry material, which serves as a reducing agent, and a gloss varnish0 The proportions of non rub, hard dry and gloss varnish are approximately 20 25 by weight of non rub material and 20 25 by weight of the hard dry additive and so 6o by weight of the gloss varnish material. The proportions are preferably 25 non rub and 25 hard dry and 50 of gloss varnish material. The non rub paste may comprise 30 to 35 by weight of a polythene type wax and 65 to 70 by weight of a quick setting varnish to make up the remainder. The pre ferred proportions are 33 of the polyurethene type wax and 6696 of the varnish. The hard dry additive may comprise 2 by weight of cobalt driers, 10 by weight of a wax compound and 88 by weight of china wood oil resin to make up the remainder. The gloss varnish material, which serves as a carrier as well as producing a gloss finish, comprises a resin base including a mixture of gum and synthetic resins.To this is added a hydrocarbon drying oil solvent. In the application of the sealant material it is desirable that the temperature should be between 50 and 600 Centigrade to aid rapid drying. It is preferable to premix the non rub, hard dry and gloss varnish materials to form the sealant in liquid form prior to application. A suitable non rub paste such as that ref erred. to above is made by Shackell, Edwards Company Limited and is identified by their Serial No. 2463. A hard dry additive is made by Fishburn Printing Ink Company Limited under theirSerial No. XC8228. The gloss varnish may be that made by J and C and is identified by their Serial No. 120 H 96659. In an alternative example, there is used a mixture of non rub material and hard dry material in the proportions 60 to 85 by weight of the non rub material and 15 to 40 by weight of the hard dry material, to make up the remainder.The preferred proportions in this example are 75 by weight of the non rub material and 25 by weight of the hard dry additive material. It is however to be understood that proportions other than those specified may be found to be sat isfactory.
