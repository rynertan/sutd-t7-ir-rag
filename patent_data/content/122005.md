# Preparation of salt solution useful for making nylon.

## Abstract
A highly concentrated aqueous solution containing 60 to 69 by weight of a solute comprising 73.5 to 77.5 by weight of adipic acid and 26.5 to 22.5 by weight of hexamethylene diamine can be maintained at 50 to 65 C without discoloration or the onset of polymerization. 66 Nylon can be prepared from this solution by evaporating water to a solute concentration of 89 to 96 by weight, adding hexamethylene diamine and heating to induce polymerization.
