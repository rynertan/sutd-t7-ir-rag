# Complementary MOSFET logic circuit.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a complementary MOSFET logic circuit having a complementary MOS inverter 23 with a pre given ratio of the channel widths of a P channel MOS FET 21 and a N channel MOSFET 22 and pregiven threshold voltages of the FETs 21, 22 so as to have an input voltage characteristic adapted for an output voltage characteristic, and a buffer circuit 24 with such an arrangement that a bipolar transistor 25 for receiving at the base a signal at the output terminal of said com plementary MOS inverter 23 and an N channel MOSFET 26 for receiving at the gate an input signal applied to the complementary MOS inverter 23 are connected in series between a high potential applying point and a low potential applying point, and a signal corresponding to a logic output signal of the complementary MOS inverter 23 is produced ot the output terminal thereof.
