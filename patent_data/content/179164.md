# Self baking electrode for electric arc furnaces and the like.

## Abstract
Self baking electrode for electric arc furnaces, particu larly suited to the production of metal silicon, ferro alloys and the like, including a containing metal casing 1 , an elec trodic carbonaceous mass 4,7 and a supporting structure 8 for said electrodic mass, said supporting structure being manufactured from carbon fibres and or composite materials based on carbon fibres, which permits to obtain products, in particular metal silicon, having a high titre and a low impurity content. Said electrode is also endowed with improved mechan ical characteristics.
