## Description
This invention relates to color photographic materials containing an ureido type cyan dye forming coupler and a fine grain silver halide emulsion. In general silver halide photographic materials, a color reproduction process by subtractive color process is employed, and in order to reproduce blue, red and yellow, this process utilizes coloring dye images of yellow, magenta and cyan which are the corresponding complementary colors, respectively. Among them, the cyan dye image is produced by a cyan dye which is formed by coupling an oxidized product of an aromatic primary amine developing agent contained in a developer with a cyan dye forming compound hereinafter called a cyan coupler . Hitherto, phenols or naphthols have been used as cyan couplers. The color images obtained from these cyan couplers, however, have several problems with respect to stability. For example, a color image obtained from 2 acylaminophenolic cyan coupler which is described in specifications of U.S. Patent 2,367,531 and 2,423,730 is generally inferior in fastness to heat, a color image obtained from 2,5 diacylaminol cyan coupler which is described in specifications of U.S. Patents 2,369,929 and 2,772,162 is generally inferior in fastness to light, and 1 hydroxy 2 naphthamide cyan coupler is generally insufficient in fastness to both light and heat. Couplers which have improved on these points include phenolic cyan couplers having an ureido group at the 2 position which are described in specifications of U.S. Patents 3,446,622, 3,996,253, 3,658,308, 3,864,366 and 3,880,661, JP A 65134 81 and EP A 28099. In comparison with other general cyan couplers mentioned above, these couplers are much improved with respect to their fastness to light and heat. However, for the reasons described below, the phenolic cyan couplers having ureido groups have serious defects in which the coupling with an oxidized product of a developing agent formed in a developer proceeds slowly. Accordingly, the sensitivity is lower than high speed reactive cyan couplers as described in JP A 1938 81, and disappearance of granularity becomes difficult to obtain, and so called aggravation of granularity occurring with coloring of all the coated couplers, is also caused. The reasons include i the dissociation equilibrium constant of the coupler is high, and in development, the concentration of the dissociated anion species which are active species of coupling reaction is low ii as a bulky ureido group is situated at the ortho position adjacent to the coupling position, the steric hindrance becomes large, preventing the approach of the oxidized product of a developing agent. Therefore, when attempting to use these couplers for photographing materials which require especially high sensitivity, they were insufficient in sensitivity. In order to fulfill the requirements relating to sensitivity, an increase in the amount of silver was required or silver halide grains having a large size were used which was accompanied by aggravation of granularity. FR A 2 352 324 discloses a color photographic material having an increased sensitivity and comprising an additional silver halide emulsion layer containing grains having a diameter less than 0.1 µm. According to the teaching of this patent it is required that the red and the green sensitive layers have specific structures consisting of a relatively less sensitive silver halide emulsion unit comprising a relatively less sensitive red sensitive silver halide layer and a relatively less sensitive green sensitive silver halide layer and a relatively more sensitive silver halide emulsion unit comprising a relatively more sensitive red sensitive silver halide layer and a relatively more sensitive green sensitive silver halide layer, the more sensitive silver halide emulsion unit being more remote from the support than the less sensitive silver halide emulsion unit. EP A 87931 which is only relevant with regard to the novelty of the present invention discloses in Example 1 a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material in which the third layer contains silver halide with a mean grain size of 0.3 µm. The fourth layer contains silver halide with a mean grain size of 1.2 µm and a 2 ureido 5 acylaminophenol cyan coupler. The inventors have shown that these problems can be solved by the addition of a fine grain silver halide emulsion to the layer adjacent to a red color sensitive emulsion layer containing a phenolic cyan coupler which is substituted by an ureido group. This improves the sensitive insufficiency caused by the above mentioned low reactivity and results in better granularity, thus making it possible to provide color photographic materials with high sensitivity and good granularity. These materials produce images which maintain excellent fastness to light and heat which is the outstanding characteristic of ureido type couplers. This invention is embodied as a silver halide color photographic material characterized by containing a cyan coupler which is substituted by an acylamino group at the 5 position and by an ureido group at the 2 position in at least one layer of silver halide emulsion layers coated on a support, and containing a fine grain silver halide emulsion in the layer adjacent to the cyan coupler containing emulsion layer. The fine grain silver halide emulsion may be contained in a light insensitive interlayer or photographic emulsion layer, either of which is adjacent to the emulsion layer containing the above cyan coupler. However, from the view point of efficiency, it is more preferably contained in light insensitive interlayer. The phenolic cyan coupler that is used in this invention is represented by the following general formula I wherein R is a chain or cyclic alkyl group, The above R and X in the general formula I are described in detail below. In the general formula I , R represents chain or cyclic alkyl group, preferably having 1 to 22 carbon atoms e.g., methyl, butyl, pentadecyl, and cyclohexyl groups, an aryl group e.g., phenyl, and naphthyl groups, preferably being a monocyclic aryl group, or a heterocyclic group e.g., 2 pyridyl, 4 pyridyl, 2 furanyl, 2 oxazolyl, and 2 imidazolyl groups, preferably being a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic group constructed from at least one hetero atom such as nitrogen or oxygen and carbon atoms, and these groups may be substituted by substituents selected from alkyl, aryl, heterocyclic, alkoxy e.g., methoxy, dodecyloxy, and 2 methoxyethoxy groups, aryloxy e.g., phenoxy, 2,4 di tert amylphenoxy, 3 tert butyl 4 hydroxyphenoxy, naphthyloxy groups, etc. , carboxyl, carbonyl e.g., acetyl, tetradecanoyl, and benzoyl groups, ester e.g., methoxycarbonyl, phenoxycarbonyl, acetoxy, benzoyloxy, butoxysulfonyl, and toluenesulfonyloxy groups, amido e.g., acetylamino, ehtylcarbamoyl, methanesulfonylamido, and butylsulfamoyl groups, imido e.g., succinimido, and hydantoinyl groups, sulfonyl e.g., methanesulfonyl , hydroxyl, cyano, nitro groups, and a halogen atom.

In the general formula I , R₁ preferably represents a halogen atom, a sulfonyl group, a sulfonamido group, a sulfamoyl group, a polyfluoroalkyl group, an acyl group, an alkoxycarbonyl group or an acylamino group, n is 1 or 2, and the preferable position of substituents is the m or p position with respect to the ureido group. More preferably, R₁ represents a sulfonyl, sulfonamido, or sulfamoyl groups, and n is 1. Specific examples of couplers which can be used according to the present invention are as follows. The typical synthetic examples of the couplers are shown below. The obtained crystals 14.6 was dissolved in acetonitrile 100 ml, and 2 2.4 di tert phenoxy butanoylchloride 16.9 g was added dropwise to the mixture under heat reflux. The mixture was refluxed for 2 hours. After cooling, the mixture was poured into water, extracted with ethyl acetate and washed with water, then the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The obtained oil was crystallized from acetonitrile to give 20.0 g of the titled coupler b.p. 129 131 C . The other couplers could be synthesized using a similar method to that of Sample coupler 1 . Boiling points of the typical couplers are as follows The fine grain silver halide emulsion used in this invention is preferred to be a silver iodobromide, silver bromide or silver chloride emulsion with the average grain size of size of 0.1 µm or less and iodine mol of 1 or less. Also, as this emulsion does not require to be sensitized by exposure and developed, chemically ripened emulsions may be used. However, low photosensitive emulsions which are not ripened chemically are somewhat preferable. The grains of these silver halide emulsions are prepared according to various preparation methods such as neutral method, semi ammonia method or ammonia method and also according to various production forms such as double jet mixing process or conversion process. These silver halides are generally coated in an amount in the range of 0.01 g m² to 1 g m², preferably in 0.05 to 0.5 g m². The photographic emulsions which can be used in this invention, including emulsions to give photosensitivity, can be prepared using the methods described in the following literature P. Glafkides, Chimie et Physique Photographique published by Paul Montel, 1967 G. F. Duffin, Photographic Emulsion Chemistry published by the Focal Press, 1966 V. L. Zelikman et al., Making and Coating Photographic Emulsion published by the Focal Press, 1964 . Namely, any of acidic method, neutral method and ammonia method may be employed, and as the form of reacting a solubilized silver salt with a solubilized halogen salt, any of single jet mixing process, double jet mixing process or the combination thereof may be used. A process for forming grains in the presence of excess silver ions so called reversal mixing process can be also used. Moreover, as one form of double jet mixing process, a process for keeping pAg in the liquid phase in which silver halide is produced constant, so called controlled double jet method, can be used. This process affords a silver halide emulsion emulsion with regular crystal form and nearly uniform grain size. A mixture of two or more kinds of silver halide emulsions separately prepared may be used. In the process of the formation of silver halide grains or of their physical ripening, there may be coexistence of cadmium salt, zinc salt, lead salt, thallium salt, iridium salt or its complex salt, rhodium salt or its complex salt, iron salt or its complex salt. Removal of a solubilized salt from the emulsion after formation of precipitates or their physical ripening may be carried out using the Nudel washing process by gelling gelatin, and also sedimentation process flocculation which utilizes inorganic salts, anionic surfactants, anionic polymers e.g., polystyrenesulfonic acid , or gelatin derivatives e.g., acylated gelatin or carbamoylated gelatin . Chemical sensitization of silver halide emulsions can be achieved by, for example, the method described in Die Grundlagen der Photographischen Prozess mit Silberhalogenden, edited by H. Frieser Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft, 1968, pp. 675 734. Namely, the following processes can be used alone or in their combined form sulfur sensitization process using a compound containing sulfur which can react with active gelatin and silver e.g., thiosulfates, thioureas, mercapto compounds and rhodanines reductive sensitization process using a reducing substance e.g., stannous salts, amines, hydrazine derivatives, formamidinesulfinic acid and silane compounds noble metal sensitization process using a noble metal compound e.g., complex salts of metals in Group VIII of the periodical table such as Pt, Ir or Pd as well as gold complex salt . The concrete examples of these processes are shown in each specification of U.S. Patents 1,574,944, 2,410,689, 2,278,947, 2,728,668, 3,656,955 for sulfur sensitization process, of U.S. Patents 2,983,609, 2,419,974, 4,054,458 for reductive sensitization process, and of U.S. Patents 2,399,083, 2,448,060, and British Patent 618,061 for noble metal sensitization process. The photographic emulsions used in this invention may contain various compounds in order to prevent fog during the production step, preservation, or photographic processing of the photographic materials or to stabilize photographic efficiency. That is, many compounds known as antifogging agent or stabilizer may be added, such as azoles, e.g., benzothiazolium salts, nitroindazoles, triazoles, benzotriazoles and benzimidazoles especially, nitro or halogen substituted derivatives heterocyclic mercapto compounds, e.g., mercaptothiazoles, mercaptobenzothiazoles, mercaptobenzimidazoles, mercaptothiadiazoles, mercaptotetrazoles especially, 1 phenyl 5 mercaptotetrazole and mercaptopyrimidines the heterocyclic mercapto compounds described above which have a water soluble group such as carboxyl and sulfone groups thioketo compounds, e.g., oxazolinethion azaindenes, e.g., tetraazaindenes especially, 4 hydroxy substituted 1,3,3a,7 tetraazaindenes benzenethiosulfonic acids benzenesulfinic acids. More detailed examples and uses are described in the specifications of U.S. Patents 3,954,474, 3,982,947, 4,021,248 and the specification of Japanese Patent Publication No. 28660 77. The photographic emulsion layers or other hydrophilic colloidal layers of the photographic material prepared using this invention may contain various surfactants for various objects such as coating auxiliary, prevention of electrification, improvement of sliding, emulsified dispersion, prevention of adhesion, and improvement of photographic characteristics e.g., acceleration of development, substractivity and sensitization . Examples of the surfactants include non ionic surfactants such as saponin steroid type , alkyleneoxide derivatives e.g., polyethyleneglycol, polyethyleneglycol polypropyleneglycol condensation products, polyethyleneglycol alkyl ethers, polyethyleneglycol alkylaryl ethers, polyethyleneglycol esters, polyethyleneglycol sorbitan esters, polyalkyleneglycol alkylamines or amides, and polyethyleneoxide adducts of silicone , glycidol derivatives e.g., polyglyceride alkenylsuccinate and alkylphenol polyglyceride , fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols, alkylesters of sugars anionic surfactants containing acidic groups such as carboxy, sulfo, phospho, sulfuric acid ester and phosphoric ester groups, e.g., alkylcarboxylic acid salts, alkylsulfonic acid salts, alkylbenzenesulfonates, alkylnaphtholenesulfonates, alkylsulfuric acid esters, alkylphosphoric acid esters, N acyl N alkyltaurines, sulfosuccinates, sulfoalkylpolyoxyethylenealkylphenyl ethers, polyoxyethylenealkylphosphorates amphoteric surfactants such as amino acids, amonoalkylsulfonic acids, aminoalkylsulfonates or phosphorates, alkylbetaines amineoxides cationic surfactants such as alkylamine salts, aliphatic or aromatic quarternary ammonium salts, heterocyclic quarternary ammonium salts, e.g., pyridinium and imidazolinium, and phosphonium or sulfonium salts containing aliphatics or heterocycles. The photographic emulsion layers of the photographic material prepared using this invention may contain, for example, polyalkyleneoxides or their derivatives such as ethers, esters, amines, thioether compounds, thiomorpholines, quarternary ammonium salt compounds, urethane derivatives, urea derivatives, imidazole derivatives or 3 pyrazolidones, in order to increase sensitivity and contrast or accelerate development. Examples of these compounds are described in, for example, U.S. Patents 2,400,532, 2,423,549, 2,716,062, 3,617,280, 3,772,021, 3,808,003, and British Patent 1,488,991. The photographic emulsion layers or other hydrophilic colloidal layers in the photographic material prepared using this invention may contain dispersion of synthetic polymers which are unsoluble or difficult to dissolve in water with the purpose of improvement of dimensional stability. Examples of the polymers include those containing, as monomer component, alkyl meta acrylate, alkoxyalkyl meta acrylate, glycyl meta acrylate, meta acrylamide, vinyl ester e.g., vinyl acetate , acrylonitrile, olefine, styrene alone or in their combined form, or the combination of the above compounds with acrylic acid, metacrylic acid, α,β unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, hydroxyalkyl meta acrylate, sulfoalkyl meta acrylate, and styrenesulfonic acid. These compounds are shown in, for example, U.S. Patents, 2,376,005, 2,739,137, 2,853,457, 3,062,674, 3,411,911, 3,488,708, 3,525,620, 3,607,290, 3,635,715, 3,645,740, and British Patents 1,186,699, 1,307,373. Photographic processing of the layers consisting of the photographic emulsion prepareed using this invention can be applied with any of the conventional methods and processing solutions as described in A fixing solution having the composition generally used can be employed. Examples of the fixing solution include organosulfur compounds which are known as effective fixer, in addition to thiosulfates and thiocyanates. The fixing solution may contain a water soluble aluminum salt as a hardening agent. The color image can be formed according to usual processes, for example, the negative positive process e.g., Journal of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers , Vol. 61 1953 , pp. 667 701 . A color developer generally consists of an alkaline aqueous solution containing a color developing agent. As the color developing agent, public known primary aromatic amine developers can be used, such as phenylenediamines e.g., 4 amino N,N diethylaniline, 3 methyl 4 amino N,N diethylaniline, 4 amino N ethyl N β hydroxyethylaniline, 3 methyl 4 amino N ethyl N β hydroxyethylaniline, 3 methyl 4 amino N ethyl N β methanesulfoamidoethylaniline, and 4 amino 3 methyl N ethyl N β methoxyethylaniline . In addition to the above, compounds described in the following references may be used Photographic Processing Chemistry by L.F.A. Mason Focal Press, 1966 , pp. 226 229, U.S. Patents 2,193,015, 2,592,364, JP A 64933 73. Moreover, the color developer can contain a pH buffer agent, a development restrainer and an anti fog agent. It may also, necessary, contain a hard water softening agent, a preservative, an organic solvent, a development accelerator, a pigmentation coupler, a competitive coupler, fogging agent, a developing sub agent, a thickener, a polycarboxylic acid type chelating agent and an antioxidant. Examples of these addditives are described in The photographic emulsion after coloring development is usually subjected to bleaching. Bleaching and fixing may be achieved simultaneously or separately. Examples of the bleaching agent include multivalent metal compounds such as iron III , cobalt III , chrome VI , and copper II peracids, quinones and nitroso compounds. More particularly, they include ferricyanates dichromates organic complex salts of iron III or cobalt III , e.g., complex salts of aminopolycarboxylic acids such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid and 1,3 diamino 2 propanoltetraacetic acid, and organic acids such as citric acid, tartaric acid and malic acid persulfates and permanganates nitrosophenol. Among them, potassium ferricyanate, sodium salt of iron III ethylenediaminetetraacetate, and ammonium salt of iron III ethylenediaminetetraacetate are particularly effective. The iron III complex salts of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid are useful in individual bleaching solution and also in monobath bleaching fixer. Various additives can be added to the bleaching solution or bleaching fixing solution, such as bleaching accelerators described in U.S. Patents 3,042,520, 3,241,966, and Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 8506 70, 8836 70, and thiol compounds described in JP A 65732 78. The photographic emulsions used in this invention may be spectrally sensitized by methyne dyes and others. Examples of effective sensitizing dyes are described in German Patent 929,080, U.S. Patents 2,493,748, 2,503,776, 2,519,001, 2,912,329, 3,656,959, 3,672,897, 4,025,349, British Patent 1,242,588, Japanese Patent Publication No. 14030 68. These sensitizing dyes may be used according to usual methods or in their combined form, and particularly, the combination of sensitizing dyes is often used for supersensitization. The typical examples are shown in U.S. Patents 2,688,545, 2,977,229, 3,397,060, 3,522,052, 3,527,641, 3,617,293, 3,628,964, 3,666,480, 3,672,898, 3,679,428, 3,814,609, 4,026,707, British Patent 1,344,281, Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 4936 68, 12375 78, and JP A 110618 77, and JP A 109925 77. In the photographic material of this invention, the photographic emulsion layers and other layers are coated on flexible supports such as plastic film, paper, and cloth which are usually used or on rigid supports such as glass, china and metal. Examples of useful flexible supports include films consisting of semi synthetic or synthetic polymers such as cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetatelactate, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, papers which are coated or laminated with baryta layer or α olefin polymer e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, and ethylene buten copolymer . The supports may be colored using dyes and pigments, and also be made black for interception of light. The surfaces of these supports are generally subjected to undercoating in order to make adhesion with photographic emulsion layers more effective. They may be also subjected to corona discharge, irradiation by ultraviolet rays, or flame treatment before or after undercoating. In the photographic material of this invention, the photographic emulsion layers and other hydrophilic colloidal layers can be coated on supports or other layers according to various conventional coating methods. The coating can be carried out by e.g. dip coating method, roller coating method, curtain coating method, extrusion coating method. The methods described in U.S. Patents 2,681,294, 2,761,791, 3,526,528 are effectively used. This invention comprises multilayer polychromic photographic materials having at least two different spectral sensitivities. Multilayer color photographic materials generally have on the supports at least one of red, blue and green color sensitive emulsion layers, respectively. The order of these layers can be freely decided depending on the need. Generally, the red, green and blue sensitive emulsion layers contain a cyan , magenta and yellow forming couplers, respectively, but these combinations can be changed as the case may be. The exposure to get a photographic image may be carried out according to usual methods. Namely, various conventional sources of light can be used, such as natural light sunlight , tungsten bulb, fluorescent lamp, mercury lamp, xenon arc lamp, carbon arc lamp, xenon flash lamp, or cathode ray tube flying spot. The exposure time may be shorter than 1 1000 s, for example, 10⁴ to 1 10⁶ s in case of using xenon flash lamp and cathode ray tube, and longer than 1 s, as well as 1 1000 s, to 1 s generally used in the case of camera. The spectral composition of light used for exposure may be controlled by color filters, necessary. Laser light can be used for exposure. Also, exposure may be achieved by light emitted from a fluorescent substance which is excited e.g. by electron beam, X rays, γ rays, and α rays. Besides the cyan coupler, other color forming couplers can be used for photographic emulsion layers of the photographic material of this invention. Namely, the compounds which can be colored by oxidative coupling with aromatic primary amine developer e.g., phenylenediamine derivatives and aminophenol derivatives , in color development processing may be used together with a polymer coupler latex, or used alone in a layer in which a polymer coupler latex is not used. Examples of magenta coupler include 5 pyrozolone coupler, pyrazolobenzimidazol coupler, cyanoacetylcumarone coupler, and open ring acylacetonitrile coupler, examples of yellow coupler include acylacetamide coupler e.g., benzoylacetanilides, and pivaloylacetanilides , and examples of cyan coupler include naphthol coupler and phenol coupler. These couplers are desirably non diffusible ones having a hydrophobic group called as ballast group in the molecule. The couplers may be used in the proportion of 4 or 2 equivalents per silver ion. Also, they may be colored couplers having an effect of color compensation or couplers releasing a development inhibiting reagent in the progress of development so called DIR coupler . They may contain, besides DIR coupler, a non color presenting DIR coupling compound which affords a colorless product by coupling reaction and releases a development inhibiting reagent. The total amount of cyan couplers used can be in the range of from 2 x 10 ³ mole to 5 x 10 ¹ mole per mole of silver. Specific examples of magenta coloring couplers are shown in U.S. Patents, 2,600,788, 2,983,608, 3,062,653, 3,127,269, 3,311,476, 3,419,391, 3,519,429, 3,558,319, 3,582,322, 3,615,506, 3,834,908, 3,891,445, German Patent 1,810,464, DE A 2,408,665, 2,417,945, 2,418,959, 2,424,467, Japanese Patent Publication No. 6031 65, JP A 20826 76, 58922 77, 129538 74, 74027 74, 159336 75, 42121 77, 74028 74, 60233 75, 26541 76 or 55122 78.

The photographic material may contain, besides DIR coupler, a compound releasing a development inhibiting reagent in the progress of development. For example, the compounds described in U.S. Patents 3,297,445, 3,379,529, DE A 2,417,914, JP A 15271 77, 9116 78 may be used.

The multilayer color photosensitive material consisting of the following layers was prepared on a cellulosetriacetate film support. Gelatin layer containing black colloidal silver Gelatin layer containing emulsified dispersion of 2,5 di n pentadecylhydroquinone Silver iodide bromide emulsion silver iodide 5 mol , average grain size 0.7 µm Silver iodide bromide emulsion silver iodide 5.5 mol average grain size 0.9 µm Silver iodide bromide silver iodide 8 mol , average grain size 1.2 µm The same as the 2nd layer Silver iodide bromide emulsion silver iodide 5 mol , average grain size 0.7 µm Silver iodide bromide silver iodide 5 mol , average grain size 0.9 µm Silver iodide bromide emulsion silver iodide 8 mol , average grain size 1.1 µm Gelatin layer containing emulsified dispersion of gelatin, yellow colloidal silver, and 2,5 di n pentadecylhydroquinone Silver iodide bromide silver iodide 5 mol , average grain size 0.7 µm Silver iodide bromide silver iodide 6 mol , average grain size 0.9 µm Silver iodide bromide silver iodide 8.5 mol , average grain size 1.4 µm Gelatin layer containing emulsified dispersion which contain ultraviolet ray absorbents UV 1 and UV 2 of the equal weight. The couplers in each layer were prepared for use by adding a predetermined amount of the coupler to a solution of tricrezylphosphate and ethyl acetate, dissolving sodium p dodecylbenzenesulfonate as emulsifier with heating, followed by mixing with a heated 10 gelatin solution, and emulsifying with colloidmill. In addition to the above composition, a gelatin hardener and a surfactant were added to each layer. The sample thus prepared was called Sample 101. Molecular weight about 40,000 It was prepared in a similar manner as Sample 101 except for adding Coupler 2, instead of Coupler C 1 in the 5th layer of Sample 101, in two times mol of Coupler C 1. Sample 103 was prepared by adding fine grain silver iodide bromide emulsion silver iodide 0.5 mol , average grain size 0.07 µm to the gelatin middle layer of the 6th layer in Sample 102 and coating so that the silver coating amount was 0.2 g.m². These samples were prepared by replacing Coupler 2 in the 5th layer of Sample 103 with the equal mol of couplers in Table 1 and changing the amount of the fine grain emulsion in the 6th layer to those shown in Table 1. Sample 107 was prepared by coating the gelatin internal layer containing the fine grain emulsion 0.5 g m² used in Sample 103 between the 4th layer and the 5th layer of Sample 102. Sample 112 was prepared by adding the fine grain emulsion 0.5 g m used in Sample 103 to the 4th layer of Sample 102. The obtained Samples 101 112 were wedged exposed with white light and subjected to the following development processing at 38 C. The compositions of processing solutions used in each step are as follows The sensitivity of cyan color images of Samples 101 to 112 is summarized in Table 1. Table 1 apparently indicates that, when the ureido type couplers are used according to the embodiments of this invention, the sensitivity in the leg part increases and becomes equal to that in the case of using a high speed reactive coupler. Next, color image stability of each sample after development was examined. The depression in density of cyan color images which were preserved at 100 C under dry atmosphere in dark place for 3 days is summarized in Table 1. The samples using ureido type couplers of this invention indicated quite excellent image stability and could afford photosensitive materials with high sensitivity and image stability.
