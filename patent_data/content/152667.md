# SYNTHESIS OF POLYURETHANE PRODUCTS

## Abstract
There are provided a wide range of polyurethane products, e.g., cellular, dense elastomer, and integral skin microcellular products, obtained by the reaction of a a polyisocyanate compound, b a polyol, c optionally a chain extender and or blowing agent with without other known additives, d in the presence of a nonhydroxyl flow modifier characterized by carbon and hydrogen atoms, at least one and, generally, a plurality of oxyalkylene groups, and at least one urethane, NHO , group. Several of the polyurethane products exhibit unique properties, e.g., foamed articles with capability to conduct static electricity, soft elastomers characterized by improved coefficient or friction, etc. Several classes of the flow modifiers are novel per se. The polyurethane products can be synthesized via the one shot or prepolymer process. Multipackage systems, in particular, two and three component systems are useful in molding operations, e.g., manufacture of shoe soles.
