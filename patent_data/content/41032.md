# Apparatus for continuous production of electrical brush contacts.

## Abstract
An apparatus 1 for forming brush contacts from spools 15 of wire W and holders h for angular ended wire seg ments s cut from said wires w , has a wire feeding means 15 for feeding spools thereof independently of each other, a cutting device 17 for cutting segments s from the wires w and feeding the segments to a common collection point where the segments s are loaded into the holders h provided, and a crimping device 19 for crimping the holder to retain the wi res s therein whithout causing flaring of the exposed ends. A checking station 23 is provided to determine whether each brush contact contains the requisite number of wire segments and ejection means 25 to eject defective contacts. The com pleted contacts are collected in such a manner as to prevent damage thereto.
