# Apparatus for contactless testing of electrical connections.

## Abstract
The system tests the continuity of electrical conductors extending through an insulating layer without contact. A flood gun 11 irradiates one side of the body 18 to charge the exposed conductors to a given potential. A steerable electron beam 14 scans the front side to generate secon dary electron emission from those conductors, which secon dary emission is measured by a detector 24 . The secondary emission is enhanced from conductors with conductivity between front side and back side as a result of the surface potential established by the rear flood beam 22 . The secondary emission varies depending on the state of con tinuity in the three dimensional network of conductors and produces signals at the detector 24 which allow clear discrimination between uninterrupted and interrupted con ductors. The system is applicable for unfired ceramics where contact destroys the specimen.
