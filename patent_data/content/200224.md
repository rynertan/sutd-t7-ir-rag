## Description
This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions and more particularly to controlled release pharmaceutical compositions containing hollow tube drug delivery systems. Controlled delivery or sustained release formulations have gained wide popularity in the pharmaceutical industry. The popularity of these formulations has grown due to the usefulness in extending the utility of particular drugs which require specific dosages and delivery of the dosage at a non toxicological rate. In the pharmaceutical industry, sustained release has been used extensively for oral medications over a number of years. Sustained release formulations include encapsulated pellets or beads, enteric coated formulations, use of slightly soluble salts, drug complexes, and porous tablets containing dispersed drugs. Controlled drug delivery on the other hand is aimed at achieving sustained release of a drug at a constant rate zero order for long periods of time. Zero order release can be provided at the present time only by mechanical pumps, such as automatic syringes and implantable pumps, osmotic pumps such as Alza s systems known as Alzet , Progestasert and Ocusert . chemically controlled biodegradable mechanisms, and diffusional systems based on polymeric membranes and matrices such as the currently marketed transdermal systems for the delivery of nitroglycerin for angina pectoris and scopolamine for motion sickness. Solid fibers have been used in sutures encapsulated with antibiotics and in intrauterine devices to release hormones. US A 4 017 030 describes devices for the controlled release of vapors for agricultural use, i.e., insecticides, pheromones. These devices are hollow tubes containing a liquid, vaporizable substance which is released to the air by evaporation from one end of the tube, the other end being sealed. The tubes used stand alone on some sort of support so that the open ends of the tubes are in contact with the air. EP A 061 192 contains essentially the same teaching as US A 4 017 030. US A A 237 885 describes the use of long hollow tubes per se to deliver drugs. The delivery module which contains the beneficial agent comprises a closed tubular member twined about itself, an internal reservoir for storing the agent, a rate controller, an energy source for transferring the agent from the reservoir to the environment and a portal for releasing the agent from the members to the environment. While much work has been done over many years relating to the sustained release and the controlled release of drugs, there still is a need for new systems that are capable of delivering a predetermined amount of a drug at a predetermined rate, over a selected time. The present invention provides such systems. According to the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically suitable carrier and at least one drug delivery system consisting essentially of 1 a plurality of polymeric tubes having thin outer membrane sheaths and hollow cores, the length of each tube independently being in the range of 0.5 mm to 15 cm. and 2 at least one solid, non volatile drug compound contained within the cores said system contained in the composition in an amount sufficient to deliver a therapeutic amount of the drug contained therein at a predetermined rate over a predetermined period of time. According to a preferred embodiment, a plurality of hollow, porous, segmented polyurethane urea tubes in the range of 0.5 mm to 15 cm in length containing at least one solid, non volatile drug in the core are contained in a pharmaceutical composition in the form of a tablet, capsule, suspension or suppository. The preparation of hollow tubes from polymers can be achieved by various routes. These are referred to as wet, dry or melt forming processes. Melt forming involves heating a polymer above its melting point and extruding it through an orifice usually referred to as a die which is designed to form a hollow tube. Once extruded, the melt is cooled via a quench which allows the polymer to solidify into a fine tube. In the dry forming process, a solution of the polymer is extruded through a desired orifice and is fed into a heated column which allows for evaporation of the solvent and subsequent formation of a tube. In a wet membrane forming process, a solution of the polymer is extruded though an orifice and quenched in a non solvent for the polymer resulting in coagulation of the polymer to a tube. Of the above mentioned forming processes, wet membrane forming allows one to easily produce hollow porous tubes. It will be appreciated that the particular forming process used will be dependent upon the polymer used and type of hollow tube desired. To make a membrane outer sheath in a hollow tube, one first dissolves or disperses a polymer to form a liquid solution. A porous membrane results when the latter process is reversed under controlled condition. The polymer coagulates into a continuous matrix as it separates from the solvent which forms a dispersion of droplets. As the polymer solidifies and the solvent is extracted, the dispersion of droplets becomes a network of open pores. This phase inversion or separation can be achieved by a number of techniques. In one, the temperature of the polymer solvent dictates the point at which the phase inversion occurs. In another, the polymer solvent is physically exchanged with a poor solvent for the polymer causing phase inversion. The size of the pores is affected by the solvent strength of a polymer. A rapid decrease in solvent strength often tends to entrap a dispersion of small droplets within the continuous polymer phase. A slow decrease in solvent strength allows for nucleation sites within the polymer matrix allowing for formation of larger pores. In this case, the reduction in solvent strength must be rapid enough to allow for the structure of the membrane to set. Another way to change porosity and volume of the porous network in the polymer is to change the concentration of the polymer solution. Lower concentrations have a tendency to promote larger pores and greater pore volume. However, there is a limit to how high usually no more than 45 w w the polymer concentration can be in a solvent, otherwise, the polymer will become the dispersed phase in a continuous solvent phase, thereby eliminating the porous network. Another method to achieve porous tubular membranes is to cause a rapid phase inversion of the polymer solution by cooling. Generally, as the polymer membrane of the hollow tube is quenched, the surface of the polymer tends to have a dense skin due to a rapid reduction of solvent strength at the surface. The interior, on the other hand, must have the solvent diffuse and migrate through the polymer matrix. This results in larger interior pores. In a thermally induced quench, the relative cooling rates can determine the relative degree of porosity. Conventional machinery used in the manufacture of tubes often has a tendency to orient the polymer by either the mechanical features of the device or by the influence of gravity. This often results in distortion of pore shape and orientation in tubular membrane production and also requires that the solution have inherent physical properties enabling it to be processed on the conventional equipment. Hot and cold drawing can also be used to vary the outside diameter of the tube and its core volume. For example, a large diameter tube can be extruded and then drawn down to a small diameter. In order to minimize the effects of orientation and maximize the benefits of uniform porosity and allow for production of membranes from fragile polymer systems, a preferred tube forming process called density gradient membrane formation is used. This process uses density gradients in the phase inversion bath. Careful selection of the coagulation solutions allows one to use gravity to gently draw and collect the thin tubular membrane in the phase inversion bath. The density gradient of the coagulation solution can be established by either multiple stacked layers of liquids with different densities, or by the use of a single coagulant subjected to a temperature gradient which in turn produces a density gradient. Proper selection of the coagulation solution is extremely important when processing delicate membranes. Depending on the density of the tube vs. the quench bath, it can be spun either upwards or downwards. For drug encapsulation, selection of the quench media is dependent on the drug solubility and miscibility of the solvent for the polymer. In order to encapsulate a drug compound in the core of the hollow tube, either a suspension, solution, or other extrudable form of the compound has to be prepared initially. This is achieved by selecting a solvent for the drug and dissolving it to a desired concentration or by melting the drug material to be encapsulated. Alternatively, a suspension of fine particles of drug in an appropriate liquid medium is prepared which can either be heated to form a liquid suspension that can be solidified in the core of the tube or can be made viscous enough for the drug to remain in suspension. Often a dilute solution of the polymer used to make the tubular membrane outer sheath serves as an adequate suspending medium for the drug. Once the appropriate drug solution or suspension is made, it is pumped into the annular die simultaneously with the solution of the polymer forming the outer sheath of the hollow tube. This is schematically illustrated in Figure 1. The resulting hollow tube containing the drug is quenched in an appropriate poor solvent for the polymer and the drug and is permitted to set in the quench bath. If necessary, the tube can be removed from the initial quench and placed in another solvent which can expedite removal of the remaining solvent in the tube, without removing the drug. For example, a volatile non solvent for the drug and tube can be used to exchange with any residual solvent remaining in the tube and subsequently be removed by vacuum extraction. After the drug encapsulated hollow tube is formed, the continuous tube is cut into lengths suitable for formulation into a pharmaceutical composition for administration to mammals, particularly in the form of a tablet, capsule, suppository or suspension. The length of the hollow tube can be as long as can conveniently be formulated into a dosage form commensurate with the delivery of a therapeutic amount of the encapsulated drug. Formulations can be prepared making use of carriers, vehicles, diluents excipients, and procedures well known to those skilled in the pharmacy art. For example, the hollow tubular delivery system can be one continuous length that can be balled up into a dosage form. The continuous tube may be more suitable for the slow release of a drug over a long period of time via an osmotic pump delivery system. In this delivery system, at least one of the tube ends is open and the membrane outer sheath is impermeable to water and the drug, i.e., the drug is delivered out the end of the tube. Release rates can be increased by making the membrane outer sheath permeable or semi permeable. Preferred pharmaceutical compositions contain a plurality of drug encapsulated hollow tubes. These tubes can be of uniform length or of different lengths with the ends either open or sealed. By varying the lengths of the tubes, openness of the ends, and permeability of the membrane outer sheath, the rate and time of delivery can be varied and be predetermined. Tube lengths of 0.5 mm to 15 cm are preferred however, shorter lengths are more preferred, e.g., the tubes are preferably less than 2 cm long, preferably in the range of 0.5 mm to 2 cm, and most preferably in the range of 0.5 mm to 6 mm. The tubes can have both ends open, both ends sealed, or one end open and one end sealed. The hollow tubes preferably have a small diameter for ease of formulation. While final diameters can be as high as 5 mm, it is preferred that they be 0.5 mm in outside diameter or less. Larger diameter tubes can be spun and then drawn down to a smaller diameter. Aspect ratios ratio of length to diameter of the tubes will generally be in the range of 1 to 30. The core diameters of the hollow tubes typically range from 25 90 of the outside diameter, preferably 40 to 85 . The drug concentration in the core of the tube depends upon many variables and will be loaded to provide the best delivery rate and time span for the particular drug involved. Drug concentration can vary over a wide range, i.e., 1 90 by weight of the total weight of the tube and compound however, it is preferred that the drug concentration be in the range of 5 to 75 by weight. The drug in the core can be mixed with a pharmaceutically suitable salt or sugar to increase the dissolution of the drug in the core. This is particularly appropriate where the tube acts as an osmotic pump since the salt or sugar assists in forcing water into the core. While magnesium sulfate is a preferred salt, other useful salts are any water soluble, divalent or monovalent salts. A hollow tube that has been found particularly suitable for pharmaceutical formulations is a segmented polyurethane urea tube free of additives having an outside diameter of less than 0.5 to 1.5 mm, a core volume of 60 90 , a length of 3 6 mm and a drug concentration in the range of 25 75 by weight. The membrane outer sheath of these tubes is porous, and had a porosity of 500 daltons or more, determined by dye penetration tests. The material of choice for production of the hollow tube depends on the characteristics one would like to have in the final product. They can be chosen for ease of membrane fabrication, hydrophilicity, elasticity, molecular weight, biocompatibility, degree of porosity, processing temperature, and compatibility with the drug being encapsulated. Polymers which can be used include polyolefins such as polypropylene, polyurethanes such as segmented polyurethane ureas, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers having a vinyl acetate content of at least 33 by weight, polyvinyl alcohols, and blends of water soluble polymers with some of the aforementioned polymers. Compositions can be used where the polymer is polypropylene having a melting index above 30 g 10 min and a solubility in hexadecylamine solvent above 20 w w. Polypropylene can be used for the production of fine hollow tubular membranes with wide variations in porosity. They are normally melt formed at temperatures above 200 C but they can also be dissolved in solvents at elevated temperatures and then quenched. Because of the high temperatures necessary for the fabrication of polypropylene hollow tubes, care must be used in selecting drugs which are not heat sensitive. Alternatively, the drug can be injected into the core of the hollow tube after it is formed however, such a procedure is not preferred. A composition is used wherein the polymer is a segmented polyurethane urea derived from polyether glycol soft segment containing no extra additives and soluble to greater than 30 w w in dimethylacetamide or n methylpyrrolidone. Polyurethanes, such as segmented polyurethane ureas sold under the name Lycra , can be dissolved at ambient temperature in dimethylacetamide DMAC or other appropriate solvent and fabricated into porous, hollow tubes at ambient temperature. They can also be blended easily with water soluble materials such as polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP , polyethylene glycol PEG , and salts which enhance porosity and wettability of the resulting tubular membranes. These tubes have high elasticity, are biocompatible, and offer great flexibility in the design of hollow tubular membranes, especially by the preferred density gradient membrane formation technique. Compositions are used wherein the polyurethane is a blend with 5 50 by weight of polyvinylpyrrolidone having a number average molecular weight of 15000 40000 or polyethylene glycol having a number average molecular weight of 400 20000. Compositions are used wherein the polymer is an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer having a melt index above 30 g 10 min and a solubility in a hydrocarbon solvent above 20 w w. Copolymers of ethylene vinyl acetate with at least 33 by weight of vinyl acetate can be dissolved at ambient temperature in tetrahydrofuran THF and fabricated into porous hollow tubes. They are easily blended with water soluble materials such as PVP, PEG, and salts. These tubular membrane systems are somewhat elastic, are biocompatible, and are easily formed into hollow tubes. Hytrel , a polyester elastomer, can also be formed into porous tubular membranes and blended with water soluble polymers. Compositions are used wherein the polymer is an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer blended with 5 to 30 by weight of a polyvinylpyrrolidone having a number average molecular weight of 15000 40000 or polyethylene glycol having a number average molecular weight of 400 20000. Polyvinyl alcohols can be dissolved easily in hot water at 60 C and can be fabricated into porous hollow tubes at ambient temperatures. Because of their solubility in water, they can be used as slowly erodible matrixes for delivery of active ingredients. Any therapeutically active drug compound can be used. In the examples which follow, the following compounds were chosen as models because of their broad range of chemical and pharmacological characteristics In the Examples which follow, hollow tubes were prepared by one of two procedures which can be varied depending upon the end results desired. Drugs were incorporated in the cores of the tubes via solutions or suspensions of the drugs. This procedure uses the arrangement shown in Figure 1. In this procedure, a solution of the polymer for the outer membrane sheath is pumped through the annular die simultaneously with a solution of the core material which results in a tubular membrane surrounding core solution. This is passed through an annular die O.D. 2.18 mm into a quench tube containing 1 liter of a coagulant for the polymer. The solvent is continuously removed from the polymer drug encapsulated system and it is collected in a rotating piddle pot. The loaded tube remains in the piddle pot as the solvent is being removed and is removed after solvent removal is nearly complete for further treatment, e.g., removal of trace amounts of solvent. The tube is formed at a rate of 0.1 to 2 cm³ min and the speed of the piddle pot is the same as the speed of the tube as it exits the quench tube. Temperature of spinning and coagulation are controlled by heating mantles surrounding the die and coagulation kettle. Table I gives Examples of drug loaded tubes which were formed by the above method. All runs were conducted at room temperature. This procedure involves membrane formation by utilization of density gradients. This procedure is desirable for most applications where membrane fabrication and drug encapsulation are involved. Due to excessive draw which is inherent in most extrusion techniques and also to the difficulty of fabricating slow forming membranes or tubes whose polymer structure has weak physical characteristics, this procedure allows for membrane formation of polymers having any or all of the characteristics mentioned. By correctly choosing coagulants with a density slightly different than that of the polymer drug encapsulated tube, one can use gravity to gently draw and collect a forming tube within the phase inversion bath coagulant . If the bath density is less than the tube, the tube will sink and collect at the bottom of the bath Figure 2 . If the bath density is greater, the spinning device is inverted and the tube will float upward and collect at the top of the phase inversion stage Figure 3 . This procedure can use several bath fluids of decreasing density stacked vertically in the tube allowing for flexibility in design to give the ability to use a sequence of quench coagulation treatments in the same phase inversion unit. For example, a layer of a heavy liquid can be placed adjacent to the die for thermal insulation. A lighter heat conductive liquid on top of this layer becomes the quenching agent. The encapsulation of drugs is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in a suitable liquid, or melting the drug, then taking this drug preparation and loading it into a stainless steel piston used for inserting the core material. A second piston for the outer sheath membrane contains the polymer solution. Temperature control, if necessary, of the pistons, die, and coagulant is accomplished by heating jackets. Die size is chosen depending on the diameter of the tube desired, and on the lumen desired. The rate at which the polymer and drug is pumped is controlled by settings on the pumps. The gap between the die and the top of the coagulation bath, where appropriate, is set according to the amount of draw down desired. In Tables I and II are given the conditions and characteristics of the tubes prepared using this procedure. All parts and percentages are by weight. The following abbreviations are used in the tables The second procedure, sometimes referred to as the rotating bottle method, uses sealed, cylindrical glass tubes immersed in water at 30 C or 37 C and filled with drug encapsulated tubes and an appropriate dissolution medium as described above. The glass tubes are tumbled at a specified rate 15 rpm throughout the test and the contents are sampled periodically to determine the amount of drug released. The length of the tests vary depending on the rate of release of the drug 2 100 hours . Time should be long enough to allow significant 50 release of drug. The The drug release patterns obtained with the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be further understood by reference to the following examples in which temperatures are in degrees centigrade.
