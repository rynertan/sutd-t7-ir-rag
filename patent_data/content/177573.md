## Description
This invention relates to a biodegradable matrix, and more particularly to a multifunctional collagen based matrix and or carrier system thereof. Delivery of drugs, growth factors, hormones, peptides and glycopeptides to external wounds has classically occurred by direct topical application and application to internal wounds by injection into the blood or by absorption into the blood through the digestive system. Controlled release of these agents has been achieved by encapsulation either in bulk or at a microscopic level using synthetic polymers, such as silicone, and natural polymers, such as gelatin and cellulose. The release rate can be controlled for periods of up to a year by proper choice of the polymeric system used to control the diffusion rate Langer, R.S. and Peppas, N.A., Biomaterials 2,201,1981 . Natural polymers, such as gelatin and cellulose slowly dissolve in a matter of minutes to hours while silicone remains intact for periods of months to years. Biodegradable polymers offer an advantage for controlled release to internal wounds since only a single surgical procedure is necessary. Collagen is a biodegradable polymer found in animals and in man. It has been used as a plasma expander, vehicle for drug delivery, vitreous body replacement, hemostatic agent, suture material, corneal replacement, hemodialysis membrane, wound dressing and artificial skin, hernia patch, vessel prosthesis, vaginal contraceptive, and injectable agent for tissue augmentation Chvapil et al., Int. Review of Connective Tissue Research 6, 1, 1973 Chvapil, in Biology of Collagen edited by A. Viidik and J. Vuust, Academic Press, chapter 22, 1980 . In most of these applications, the collagen is reconstituted and crosslinked into an insoluble form. There is described in Yannas et al, U.S. patent 4,060,081 , the use of collagen and mucopolysaccarides as synthetic skin. Such material is cross linked using glutaraldehyde, a bifunctional cross linking agent, which reacts with free amines. DE A 2734503 also describes the production of collagen matrices by chemical crosslinking using glutaraldehyde. One major drawback to using crosslinked collagen has been the adverse biological effects of free glutaraldehyde, a common agent used to crosslink and insolubulize collagen in many applications. Leaching of glutaraldehyde from crosslinked collagens has been shown to be cytotoxic to cells, specifically fibroblasts Speer et al., J. Biomedical Materials Research 14,753,1980 Cooke et al., British J. Exp. Path. 64,172,1983 . Recent evidence suggests that glutaraldehyde polymers and not monomeric glutaraldehyde form crosslinks between collagen molecules these crosslinks can then rearrange to release free glutaraldehyde and glutaraldehyde polymers Cheung, D.T. and Nimni, M.D., Connective Tissue Research 10, 187 217, 1982 . To overcome the toxicity associated with glutaraldehyde, the chemical crosslinking can be carried out using a carbodiimide as disclosed in US 3098693, where the shrink and crease resistance of a fabric selected from a fabric such as wool and silk is improved by immersing the fabric in an aqueous solution of water soluble, monocarbodiimide. However the use of a single chemical crosslinking step alone does not produce the necessary degree of resistance to biodegradation to render it suitable for impregnation with a carrier compound for controlled release of drugs. An object of the present invention is to provide a novel biodegradable matrix. Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel collagen based matrix. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a novel collagen based matrix in sponge or sheet form. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a novel biodegradable matrix impregnated with a carrier compound. A further object of the present invention is to provide a novel biodegradable collagen based matrix impregnated with a carrier compound. Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide a novel biodegradable collagen based matrix impregnated with a carrier compound in sponge or sheet form. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a novel biodegradable collagen based matrix impregnated with a carrier compound and is non toxic and capable of promoting cell growth. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a novel biodegradable collagen based matrix impregnated with a carrier compound for controlled release of drugs. Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide a novel biodegradable collagen based matrix impregnated with a carrier compound for topical application to external wounds. Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel biodegradable collagen based matrix impregnated with a carrier compound for application to internal wounds. These and other objects of the present invention are achieved in one embodiment by forming a sponge or sheet of a collagen based material including a collagen selected from the group consisting of types I, II and III collagens which sponge or sheet is contacted with a cross linking agent selected from the group consisting of a carbodiimide or a succinimidyl active ester to form an intermediate collagen based matrix which is subsequently subjected to a dehydrothermal cross linking treatment at an elevated temperature and at reduced pressure to form a collagen based matrix in sponge or sheet form. In another embodiment, the sponge or sheet of the collagen based material is first subjected to a dehydrothermal cross linking treatment at an elevated temperature and at reduced pressure followed by contacting the thus formed intermediate collagen based matrix with a carbodiimide crosslinking compound to form the collagen based matrix in sponge or sheet form. In still another embodiment of the invention the cross linking agent is admixed with the collagen based material prior to formation of the intermediate collagen based sponge or sheet followed by processing steps of dehydrothermal cross linking. In a particularly preferred form of the invention, a carrier compound is incorporated during processing to form a collagen based matrix in sponge or sheet form impregnated with a carrier compound wherein the carrier compound is selected from the group consisting of types IV and V collagen, fibronectin, laminin, hyaluronate, proteoglycan, epidermal growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, angiogenesis factor, antibiotic, antifungal agent, spermacidal agent, enzyme and enzyme inhibitor. The collagen based carrier systems of the present invention are based on the use as a starting material of a soluble or insoluble collagen selected from the group consisting of types I, II and III collagens and mixtures therof. Soluble collagens of the types I, II and III collagen are prepared by limited enzymatic digestion of tissue enriched in such collagen types and are formed into collagen based solution i.e. a soluble collagen dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as dilute hydrochloric acid, dilute acetic acid or the like . Insoluble collagens are derived from the following typical sources type I collagen bovine, chicken and fish skin, bovine and chicken tendons and bovine and chicken bones including fetal tissues type II collagen bovine articular cartilage, nasal septum, sternal cartilage and type III collagen bovine and human aorta and skin. In one embodiment of the present invention, a collagen based solution or an insoluble collagen dispersed and swollen in a suitable liquid media e.g. dilute hydrochloric acid, dilute acetic acid or the like is subjected to a temperature of between about 0 C. to 100 C. to thereby solidify the collagen based material. Thereafter, the solidified collagen based material is subjected to a vacuum of less than about 50 millitcrr 6.5 Pa at a temperature of from about 22 C. to 100 C. to form a collagen based sponge to be further processed, as hereinafter more clearly described. Generally, a weight ratio of soluble or insoluble collagen to solvent or dispersion agent, respectively, of from 1 to 10,000 or from 1 to 15 is used to form the collagen based solution or dispersion. In another embodiment of the present invention such a collagen based solution on a collagen based dispersion is dried into sheet form prior to further processing as more fully hereinafter described. Drying is effected at temperatures of from 4 C. to 40 C for a period of time of from 2 to 48 hours. In one embodiment of the present invention to form a collagen based matrix, a collagen based sponge or sheet is first contacted with a crosslinking agent selected from the group consisting of a carbodiimide or N hydroxysuccinimide derived active esters succinmidyl active ester followed by dehydrothermanl cross linking treatment at an elevated temperature and at a reduced pressure to form a collagen based matrix. Examples of the carbodiimides include cyanamide and 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride. Examples of bifunctional succinimidyl active esters including bifunctional N hydroxysuccinimide, 3,3¹ dithio sulfosuccinimidyl proprionate and bis sulfosuccinimidyl suberate. When using a carbodiimide crosslinking agent, the collagen based sponge or sheet is immersed in a carbodiimide solution at a concentration from about 0.1 to 10 W V maintained at a temperature of from about 2 to 40 C. and at a pH of between 2 to 11 for a period of time of from about 2 to 96 hours. When using a succinimidyl active ester crosslinking agent, the collagen based sponge or sheet i immersed in a solution thereof at a concentration of from about 0.1 to about 15.0 W V maintained at a temperature of from about 2 to 40 C. for a period of time of from about 2 to 96 hours. The collagen based sponge or sheet is placed in a solution containing 0.1 to about 15 W V of N hydroxysuccinimide and carbodiimide at a pH between 2 to 11 for a period of time between 2 to 96 hours at a temperature of from about 2 C. to 400 C. The thus treated intermediate collagen based matrix is exhaustively washed to remove excess crosslinking agent. Dehydrothermal cross linking treatment of the intermediate collagen based matrix involves conditions of temperature of from 50 C. to 200 C. at a vacuum of 50 millitorr 6.5 Pa or less for a period of time of from 2 to 96 hours to thereby form the collagen based matrix. Prior to dehydrothermal cross linking treatment, the intermediate collagen based matrix in sponge form is preferably solidified at a temperature of between about 0 C. to 100 C. and thereafter subjected to a vacuum of at least 50 millitorr 6.5 Pa at a temperature of between about 22 C. and 100 C. In another embodiment of the present invention to form the collagen based matrix when using a carbodiimide crosslinking agent, dehydrothermal cross linking treatment may be effected to form an intermediate collagen based matrix prior to contracting such an intermediate collagen based matrix with such a crosslinking agent. In another embodiment of the present invention to form the collagen based matrix, the cross linking agent is premixed with the collagen based material prior to drying or initiating of freeze drying processing steps. The collagen based matrix prepared in accordance with the present invention may be described as a coral like or scaffold structure having interstices of a pore size of from 3 to 100 µm., and of a molecular weight of from 1.0 X 10⁶ to in excess of 50 X 10⁶ with a molecular weight between crosslinks from 1,000 to 100,000 via the formation of covalent bonds. Another embodiment of the present invention is the incorporation of a carrier compound into the collagen based matrix. Such a carrier compound is selected from the group consisting of collagen types IV and V, fibronectin, laminin, hyaluronate, proteoglycans, epidermal growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, angiogenesis factor antibiotic, antifungal agent, spermacidal agent, hormone, enzyme and enzyme inhibitors. Generally, the carrier compound may be introduced at any time during processing of the collagen based material to the collagen based matrix in sponge or sheet form. Preferably, a carrier compound is incorporated prior to solidifying of the soluble or insoluble collagen in forming the intermediate collagen based matrix, or prior to solidifying of the intermediate collagen based matrix prior to dehydrothermal cross linking treatment. The carrier materials are added in an amount of from 1 to 30 w w based on the weight of soluble or insoluble collagen. Generally, connective tissue factors, such as fibronectin, types IV and V collagens laminin, glycosaminoglycans and hyaluronate are incorporated during initial processing steps in forming the collagen based sponge, or after crosslinking of the intermediate collagen based matrix. It is preferable to incorporate fibronectin and hyaluronate during forming of the intermediate collagen based matrix. There are many sources for the diverse carrier compounds for incorporaton into the collagen based matrix constituting one embodiment of the present invention. Type IV and V collagens are found associated with basement membranes and smooth muscle cells in tissues, respectively. Typical sources of Type IV include the EHS mouse sarcoma tumor, bovine and human placenta, lens capsule and kidney sources of Type V collagen include placental membranes, ocular tissues and fetal skin see for example, Trelstad, In Immunochemistry of the Extracellular Matrix, Vol. 1 edited by H. Furthmayr, CRC Press, chapter 2, 1982 . Typical sources of proteoglycans include bovine and human cartilage and synovial fluid, nasal septum and sternal cartilage, and skin. Typical sources for glycoproteins include EHS tumor, bovine and human kidneys, cartilage, bone and placenta as well as bovine and human blood. Typical sources of hyaluronate include rooster comb and bovine vitreous. Preferred carrier compounds for the collagen based matrix include fibronectin, laminin, type IV collagen and complexes of hyaluronate and proteogylcans. A value of the swelling ratio of between 2.5 to 5 is required for a collagen based matrix which comes into contact with open wounds, while a swelling ratio of between 2.5 to 10 are useful for a collagen based matrix including carrier compounds for subcutaneous implantation. The swelling ratio is defined as the volume of water absorbed per unit volume of collagen based matrix. In the case of internal wounds and short term drug release, collagen based matrix including a carrier compound in the form of a sheet or a tube is placed in direct contact with tissue. The biodegradation rate and the release rate can be controlled by variation of the crosslink density. For applications where long term release is desired, a nonporous diffusion layer of a biodegradable polymer, such as poly 3 hydroxybutyrate is applied to each side of the collagen based matrix. For materials to be used on full thickness wounds, a diffusion control layer, such as described in the aforementioned U.S. Letters Patent to Yannas, is applied to prevent diffusion of water or other small volatile molecules from the collagen based matrix the diffusion control layer must adhere tightly to the collagen based matrix layer. The combination of collagen based matrix layer and diffusion control layer must be strong enough to be sutured and have a tensible strength of at least 100 psi 689 KN.m ² and be able to deform at least 10 before failing. Silicone polymers are preferred materials to control the rate of diffusion of small molecules. Curing of the adhesive in the diffusion control layer can occur without wetting the carrier compound in the collagen based matrix by dessication at room temperature. A film 0.5 to 1.5 mm in thickness is applied to the matrix layer and is allowed to cure at room temperature for at least 2 hours using a vacuum of 14 in. of Hg 47.41 kPa . The thickness of the collagen based matrix can be varied from 1 to several hundred mm. For full thickness wounds, a thickness of 2 to 3 mm. is desired and enables close contract between the carrier compound in the collagen based matrix and the wound bed. When implanted subcutaneously or directly on full thickness dermal wounds, any collagen based matrix of the present invention does not stimulate the inflammatory process. In addition, chronic implantation results in fibroblast and endothelial cell migration into the collagen based matrix. The degradation and resorption rate of collagen based matrices are as assayed in vitro by determination of the time that 1 mg. of the material resists solubilization by 100 units of bacterial collagenase. One unit of collagenase liberates amino acids in collagen equivalent to 1.0 micro mole of L leucine in 5 hours it 37 C. A combination of succinimidyl active ester formation and dehydrothermal cross linking treatment or carbodiimide treatment and dehydrothermal cross linking treatment increases the collegenase resistance time significantly over that observed by any of the procedures heretofore used. These studies indicate that the crosslinking methods of the present invention result in resistance to collagenase degradation and show no stimulation of inflammation. The following examples are illustrative of conditions for the process of the present invention and it is to be understood that the scope of the invention is not to be limited thereby. The collagen used is prepared from calf hides after the grain layer is separated from the corium or dermis. The corium is cut into pieces, washed, swollen, freeze dried and stored at 20 C. Soluble collagen is obtained by placing 250 gr. of the freeze dried insoluble collagen in 1.5 liters of HCl at a pH of 2.5 containing 1.5 gr. of crystalline pepsin Sigma Chemical Company . The mixture is stirred overnight at 4 C. and then filtered through cheese cloth, Whatman filter paper 4 followed by Whatman 42, Gelman 5 µm and 1.2 µm filters and finally through Millipore 0.65 µm and 0.45 µm filters. The soluble fraction obtained after sequential filtration contains types I, III and V collagens. The soluble collagen fraction is dialyzed against a 1.0 M NaCl solution containing 50 mM Tris adjusted to pH 7.5 and enough solid NaCl is added to raise the molarity of the solution to 1.7. The precipitate at 1.7 M NaCl is type III collagen and is collected by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 60 minutes and then dialyzed versus 0.005 M acetic acid, freeze dried and stored at 20 C. To the supernatant is added additional NaCl to raise the molarity to 2.5 M and the precipitate type I collagen is pelleted by centrifugation, dialyzed versus 0.005 M acetic acid, freeze dried and stored at 20 C. The remaining supernatant contains type V collagen and is dialyzed against 0.005 M acetic acid, freeze dried and stored at 20 C. Insoluble collagen solutions are obtained by dispersing freeze dried corium ground using a Wiley Mill in HCl at pH of 2.5. The swollen collagen is then dialyzed against 0.005 M acetic acid and freeze dried. If mature bovine hide is the source of the corium, the insoluble collagen produced is typically type I. Soluble type IV collagen is extracted from the mouse EHS sarcoma tumor after washing the tumor in cold distilled water 3 times by spin filtration at 10,000 x g for 30 minutes. The pellet 0.500 gr is homogenized in 0.5 liters of 0.5 M acetic acid adjusted to pH 2.5 with HCl and 0.5 gr of pepsin is added. The homogenate is allowed to mix at 4 C. for 24 to 48 hours, filtered through cheese cloth, spun at 10,000 x g for 30 minutes. The pellet is re suspended in 0.5 M NaCl containing 50 mM Tris, NaCl is added until a final concentration of 4.5 M is obtained, centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 30 minutes and the pellet is dialyzed against 0.1 N acetic acid 3 times and freeze dried. Freshly drawn bovine blood 80 ml is collected in a polypropylene tube containing 20 ml. of 5 trisodium citrate and 0.1 mM phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride. The blood is centrifuged at 300 x g for 10 minutes and the plasma is then separated from the cell layer and further centrifuged at 30,000 x g at a temperature of 15 C. for 30 minutes. To the plasma is then added an additional 1 mM of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then it is poured through a gelatinsepharose column. The column is washed with a phosphate buffer solution 0.182 M phosphate and 0.145 M NaCl , 2 column volumes 1M NaCl in a phosphate buffer, 2 column volumes of phosphate buffer solution, 2 column volumes of 4 M urea in a phosphate buffer. The optical density of column fractions is monitored at a wavelength of 280 nm with the bulk of the fibronectin normally present in the fractions containing 4 M urea. Fibronectin containing fractions having optical densities greater than 0.1 are dialyzed against 0.180 M phosphate buffer containing 0.145 M Nacl pH 7.2 . The sample is then dialyzed against 0.05 M Tris HCl containing 4.5 M urea pH 7.2 and applied to a DEAE diethylaminoethyl cellulose ion exchange column at room temperature. The column is eluted with a 0 to 0.3 M NaCl linear gradient in a 0.05 M Tris HCl buffer solution pH 7.2 containing 4.5 M urea. The eluted fibronectin is dialyzed against 0.180 M phosphate containing 0.145 M NaCl and 1.0 M urea and frozen at 20 C. Laminin is prepared for lathrytic EHS tumors grown in C57 6J mice. The tumors are dissected and homogenized in 3.4 M NaCl containing 50 mM Tris HCl adjusted to pH 7.4 and protease inhibitors. The homogenate is centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 60 minutes the pellet is collected and resuspended in 3.4 M NaCl. Following centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 60 minutes a second time, the homogenate is resuspended in 0.5 M NaCl containing 50 m M Tris HCl pH 7.4 and protease inhibitors stirred for 18 24 hours at 4 C. followed by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 60 min. The supernatant is brought to 3.5 M by addition of solid NaCl, stirred overnight at 4 C. and the precipitate is collected by centrifugation. Laminin is further purified by redissolving in 0.5 M NaCl containing 50 mM Tris Hcl pH 7.4 followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 60 minutes the supernatant is dialyzed against 2 M urea containing 2.5 NaCl and 50 m M Tris HCl pH 8.6 and chromatographed over a 2.5 x 2.5 cm. column containing DEAE cellulose equilibrated with the same buffer at 4 C. The unbound fraction is dialyzed against 2 M urea containing 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.6 and rechromatographed on the DEAE column equilibrated with the same buffer. The unbound fraction is concentrated by vacuum dialysis and chromatographed on Sephacryl S 300 equilibrated with 1.0 M CaCl₂, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 at 22 C. the void volume is collected and dialyzed against 0.4 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris Hcl pH 7.4 and stored at 4 C. Laminin is resolubilized in 0.1 M ammonium hydroxide pH 11.0 and then the pH is adjusted to 7.2. Soluble or insoluble collagen 1.2 gr. is added to 120 ml. of a dilute HCl solution of pH 3.0 and the mixture is ground in a Waring Blender at low speed for 1 minute and thereafter at high speed for 1 minute. The solution or dispersion is then poured into a vacuum flask end deaerated at a vacuum of 100 millitorr 13 Pa minutes. Collagen dispersions and solutions to be converted into sponges are cooled to 0 C and frozen at 100 C. before freeze drying at 65 C. under a vacuum of less than 10 millitorr 1.3 Pa . Collagen dispersion or solutions to be processed into sheets were placed in a sterile hood and allowed to air dry for 24 to 48 hours at 22 C. Nine grams of succinic anhydride are dissolved in 80 ml. of distilled water and mixed for 30 minutes at 37 C. After the succinic anhydride is in solution, the pH is adjusted to 7.2 and the volume brought to 100 ml. This solution is placed in a Waring Blender and 1.0 gr. of collagen is added, ground for 2 minutes, allowed to stand at 22 C. for 1 hour, placed on Whatman 4 filter paper to remove unreacted succinic anhydride and then washed with 100 ml. of distilled water. The residue is placed in a solution of 20 ml. of phosphate buffer 0.182 M phosphate and 0.145 M NaCl and 2 gr. of N hydroxysuccinimide and 2 gr. of cyanamide are added. The solution pH is then adjusted to 7.2. The residue is allowed to react for 3 hours at room temperature and then washed with distilled water in a Buchner funnel under a vacuum of 14 in. of Hg 47.41 kPa . Sheets and sponges of succinylated, succinimidyl ester crosslinked intermediate collagen based matrices are produced in accordance with the processes described in Example 4. To 1.2 gr. soluble or insoluble collagen in 120 ml. of HCl pH 3.0 is added to 0.12 gr. of fibronectin in 2.5 mg. fibronectin ml 0.1 M urea containing 0.182 M phosphate and 0.145 M NaCl and the mixture is dispersed in a Waring Blender for 2 minutes. Sheets and sponges are prepared in accordance with the processes described in Example 4. Collagen sheets and sponges formed according to Examples 4 and 6 are swollen in a 0.1 ammonium acetate pH 7.2 containing 1 to 5 laminin, fibronectin or type IV collagen. The swollen sponge or sheet is then frozen and freeze dried at 65 C. and in a vacuum less then 50 millitorr 6.5 Pa . To 1.2 gr. of soluble and insoluble collagen in HCl ph 3.0 as added to 0.12gr. of a complex of hyaluronate and proteoglycans Sigma Chemical Company Grade III P in a HCl pH 2.0 to a final volume of 120 ml. The mixture is dispersed in a Waring Blender and either freeze dried or air dried in accordance with the processes of Example 4. To 1.2 gr. of soluble or insoluble collagen type I in HCl pH 2.0 is added to 0.012 gr. of type IV collagen in a 0.1 M ammonium acetate pH 7.2 to a final volume of 120 ml. The mixture is dispersed in a Waring Blender for 2 minutes and formed into sheets or sponges in accordance with the processes of Example 4. The product of Examples 4 and 6 to 9 are crosslinked by immersion in an aqueous solution containing 1 by weight of cyanamide at pH 5.5 for a period of 24 hours at 22 C. After removal, the sponges and sheets are exhaustively washed in several changes of water over 24 hours, frozen and freeze dried at 65 C. in a vacuum of less than 50 millitorrs 6.5 Pa . The products of Examples 4 and 6 to 10 are placed in a vacuum oven at room temperature and exposed to a vacuum of less than 50 millitorr 6.5 Pa . After one hour the samples are heated to 110 C. and remain at this temperature for 72 hours at which time the temperature is lowered to 40 C. The samples are then removed from the vacuum oven and stored 20 C. Two grams of succinimidyl active ester crosslinked collagen prepared according to Example 5 is placed in a Waring Blender containing 400 ml. of HCl pH 2.0 and dispersed for two minutes. This mixture is deaerated by placing in a vacuum of 300 millitorr 39 Pa and is then placed at room temperature in a 100 relative humidity environment for 24 hours. The materials is then cooled to 0 C., frozen and freeze dried at 65 C. using a vacuum of less than 50 millitorr 6.5 Pa or air dried to make sponges or sheets, respectively. Sponges and sheets prepared according to Examples 4 to 9 are placed in 20 ml. of HCl at pH 2.0 containing 25 cysteine or 0.1 W V α 2 macroglobulin. The mixture is frozen and freeze dried at 65 C. at a vacuum of less than 50 millitorr 6.5 Pa or air dried at room temperature. One cm.³ of each of the products of the above Examples is placed in 2.0 ml of 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4 containing 25 mM calcium chloride and ICO units of type IV collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum Sigma Chemical Co. is added per mg of sample. The samples are placed In a 37 C. environment and the intactness of each sample is visually checked every 10 minutes. The time is recorded when each sample has visibly degraded into pieces smaller than about 0.5 µm. The results are presented in Table I. The swelling ratio of denatured collagen is inversely related to the degree of crosslinking. The products of the above Examples were boiled for 2 minutes in distilled water and then blotted between two napkins. A 1 kg. weight was placed on top of the napkins containing the materials for 20 seconds. The wet sample weight was recorded and the sample was then dried at 110 C. for 3 hours. After drying the weight was again recorded and the swelling ratio r was calculated from the following relationship and where Sponges and sheets prepared in accordance with the above Examples were cut into rectangular 4.0 cm x 1.0 cm strips and immersed in phosphate buffer solution pH 7.5 for 20 minutes prior to mechanical testing. The strips were tested in uniaxial tension at 22 C. at a strain rate of 10 minute using an Instron Model 1122 testing device. The ends of the strips were placed in pneumatic grips that were closed under a pressure of 40 psig. 376.93 KN.m ² with a gage length of 20 mm. Stress strain curves were obtained from which the Young s moduli at high HSM and low strains were calculated. The strain at which the low modulus region ended was designated e Sponges and sheets prepared in accordance with to the above Examples were tested for biocompatibility subcutaneously after sterilization by exposure 2.5 M rads of gamma radiation. Implantation was carried out under sterile conditions using 350 gr. white female guinea pigs as test animals. A 1 cm. cutaneous incision was made on one side of the back and the skin was separated from the fascial layer and a 1 cm. x 1 cm. piece of the implant was placed in this space. The edges of the skin were fastened together over the implant using wound clips. Animals were sacrified on the 6th, 9th and 12th post implantation day and the tissue containing the carrier was placed in Carson s fixative and processed for histological studies. The results are presented in the following Table II. Using sponges and sheets prepared in accordance with to Examples 4 to 10, a 1 mm. layer of Silastic Medical Grade adhesive was applied to the surface of the matrix layer using a spatula. The diffusion control layer is cured by application of a vacuum of 100 millitorr 13 Pa for a period of 2 hours at 22 C. The resultant complex of the diffusion control and matrix layers was placed in contact with full thickness dermal wounds. Sponges and sheets prepared according to Example 18 were tested after radiation sterilization as dressings on open dermal wounds on female Hartley Albino 350 gr. white guinea pigs. Each animal was separately fed and weighed for 4 days prior to testing. One day before testing, the animal was shaved using an electric clipper followed by depilatory treatment with Nair and washed. The animal was then anesthetized by exposure to ether and its back washed with providone iodine and alcohol solutions. A 2 cm. x 2 cm. piece of material composed of matrix and diffusion control layers soaked in a phosphate buffer solution 0.182 M phosphate and 0.154 M NaCl , was placed on a full thickness dermal wound on the same area with the matrix layer against the panniculus carncsus. The matrix and the diffusion control layers were sutured to the wound bed at the edges of the dressing using chrome tanned gut sutures. The animal was bandaged by placing sterile cotton dressing sponge over the wound dressing and then wrapped with an Elasticon elastic tape Johnson and Johnson Products, Inc. secured around the neck. Animals were housed three to a cage during the experiment. The animals were monitored daily and their bandages examined for tears. Animals were sacrified at 6, 9 and 12 day post implantation and the implant and wound beds were excised, fixed and processed for histological examination. The results are presented in Table III. Numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings and, therefore, within the scope of the appended claims, the inventions may be practised otherwise than as particularly described.
