# METHOD OF INCREASING THE YIELD OF A PRODUCT BY ALTERING A MICROORGANISM

## Abstract
A method is described for increasing the yield of a product from a microorganism containing a regulatory gene, by altering the microorganism. The method involves intro ducing into the microorganism at least one structural gene for the product by lysogenizing the microorganism with a recombinant bacteriophage containing the structural gene.
