# Method of manufacturing a low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp and low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp manufactured by means of this method.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a low pressure mercury va pour discharge lamp with a discharge vessel comprising two or more substantially parallel co extending glass dis charge tube portions 4 and 5 interconnected through a coupling 11 , extending transversely to the wall of said tube portions 4, 5 , in which first the inner wall of an elongate tube is provided with a luminescent material 2 , which, whilst heating at least a small zone of the wall, is then di vided into two portions, end walls 6, 7 being formed on which the luminescent layer extends however, no particles of the luminescent material are enclosed in the glass of the end wall during said dividing process and fracture is avoided at least after cooling. At least at the area of the transition from the end wall to the tube wall, the ratio AB CD is 0.4 to 0.8.
