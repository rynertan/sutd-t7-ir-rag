# An NMR method for measuring and imaging fluid flow.

## Abstract
A method for measuring direction and magnitude and imaging fluid flow in an NMR sample 100 . Nuclei in an imaging slice, transaxial, for example, to a direction of fluid flow, are first tagged saturated or inverted and then excited to pro duce a first NMR signal. This signal originates from tagged nu clei in the imaging slice 104 and untagged nuclei which have partially or wholly replaced nuclei flowing out of the slice 104 . Thereafter, nuclei are tagged in a second thicker sample re gion 106 which includes the imaging slice 104 and extends therefrom in a direction opposite to the fluid flow. The nuclei are again excited in the imaging slice 104 . The NMR signal detected is again from the entire imaging slice 104 but is due entirely to tagged nuclei if the second slice is selected to have the appropriate thickness and, therefor, has a smaller magni tude than the first signal. These signals are useful in measuring the fluid flow velocity. The method is also useful, for example, with multiple angle projection reconstruction and two dimen sional Fourier transform 2DFT techniques to reconstruct NMR images exhibiting flowing nuclei only.
