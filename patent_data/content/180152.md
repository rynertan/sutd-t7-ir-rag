# Bar code reading method and apparatus.

## Abstract
In a bar code reading apparatus, comparison reference values are calculated on the basis of zone values that correspond to the width of bar and space zones making up a bar code pattern, and prestored constants, the width of the said zones being determined thereby. This eliminates the need to scan the bar code pattern at a constant rate, and provides accurate readings even when there are printing variations in the width and sharpness of the pattern elements.
