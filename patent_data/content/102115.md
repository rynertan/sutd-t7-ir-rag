# Polyester ester urethane.

## Abstract
The invention relates to novel high molecular weight polyester ester urethanes containing blocks of ester units of a high melting polyester and of blocks of ester units of a low melting polyester which are linked together through ester groups and or urethane groups. The melting point of the polyester ester urethanes is at least 150 C and when the blocks of ester units of the low melting polyester form part of less than 50 by weight of the total number of ester units the upper limit of the glass transition range Tg When the number of end groups of the high melting polyester and the low melting polyester together amount to more than 700 meq per kg, the transesterification catalyst present in one or in both polyesters or polyester amides is entirely or partly deactivated before and or during the preparation of the polyester ester.
