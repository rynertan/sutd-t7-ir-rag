# Method for preparing silica supported hydrotreating catalysts and catalysts thus prepared.

## Abstract
Silica supported hydrotreating catalysts are prepared by impregnating a dry silica support with a hydrogenation metal containing solution obtained by reacting a molybde num halide and or a nickel and or cobalt halide in the presence of a nitrile and heating the mixture formed to between 25 to 80 C until most of the metal compounds have reacted and or dissolved followed by removal of undissolved solids from the solution, and drying the impre gnated silica support at elevated temperature.
