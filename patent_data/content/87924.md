## Description
PROCESS FOR THE CATALYTIC OXIDATION OF A PARAFFINIC HYDROCARBON TO AN ALCOHOL AND EITHER AN ALDEHYDE OR A KETONE The present invention relates to a process for the production of an alcohol and either an aldehyde or a ketone by oxidising a paraffinic hydrocarbon in the presence of a soluble iron catalyst, a reducing agent and molecular oxygen. Since the world s known oil reserves are being depleted at a faster rate than exploration is 1nrring new reqarv√ß the e is 2 growing search for alternative long term sources of chemicals feedstock. Both coal, of which there are large reserves, and natural gases, eg methane and ethane, which are relatively abundant and are in many cases currently flared off as unwanted by products of oil production, are receiving increasing attention as potential chemicals feedstock. One approach is to convert them to a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen synthesis gas using well known technology and thereafter to convert catalytically the synthesis gas into oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as alcohols, acids and esters.Another approach, is to oxidise paraffinic hydrocarbons directly to alcohols under mild conditions. It is with the latter approach that the present invention is concerned. Although no chemical systems are known which are selective hydroxylation catalysts under ambient conditions, certain enzymes have been observed to give highly specific hydroxylation reactions yielding terminal alcohols. Such reactions occur in the liver under the influence of the porphyrin enzyme cytochrome P450. The path of this reaction is believed to involve a hydrogen donor DoH2 so that one oxygen atom from the oxygen molecule is incorporated into the alkane and the other into a molecule of water according to the overall equation EMI2.1 The first reagent system to mimic this vital biological process was that of Udenfriend, Clark, Axelrod and Brodie reported in J. Biol.Chem, 1954, 208, 731. In this a mixture of ferrous ion with ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid EDTA and ascorbic acid in a phosphate buffer was used to hydroxylate simple aromatic compounds like acetanilide. The addition of hydrogen peroxide increased the rate of the reaction. Later workers have modified the conditions drastically, omitting the EDTA and the ascorbic acid and using hydrogen peroxide instead of oxygen. It is thus possible to oxygenate cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and to convert benzene into phenol. The Udenfriend system has also been further modified by leaving out the EDTA and the ascorbic acid, but keeping oxygen as the oxidant. For example Kimura et al Chem. Pharm. Bull., 1972, 20, 1883 were able to convert deoxycholic acid into 15 alpha hydroxydeoxycholic acid using ferrous sulphate in a disodium hydrogen phosphate buffer.Mimoun and Roch Tetrahedron 1975, 31, 777 used ferrous chloride and hydrazobenzene with 302 as oxidant for the cyclohexane to cyclohexanol conversion.Ullrich Z. Naturforsch, 1969, 24B, 699 used a system composed of ferrous ion and thiosalicyclic acid for hydroxylation of cyclohexane and aromatic compounds giving a slightly higher selectivity than earlier systems. Seto et al Tet. Letters, 1980, 2565 , in model experiments designed to demonstrate the importance of SH or Se binding to the iron atom in the centre of the porphyrin molecule of cytochrome P450, previously identified by spectroscopic techniques, recently oxygenated adamantane selectively at the secondary hydrogen atoms in a very low yield using Fe Salen 2O with beta hydroxy ethyl mercaptan and oxygen. A common feature of many of the prior art systems is the use of a soluble iron catalyst, a reducing agent in the form of a carboxylic acid which functions also as a source of protons, and molecular oxygen. It has now been found that hydroxylation products, ie alcohols and either aldehydes or ketones, can be obtained in greater yields by using as the reducing agent a zerovalent metal in combination with an acid. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the production of an alcohol and either an aldehyde or a ketone by oxidising in a liquid medium a paraffinic hydrocarbon in the presence of a soluble iron catalyst, a reducing agent and molecular oxygen characterised in that as the reducing agent there is used a zerovalent metal and in combination therewith there is used an acid. The paraffinic hydrocarbon may suitably be a linear, branched or cyclic paraffin containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Preferably the paraffin is a linear or branched paraffin containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms or a mixture thereof. Suitable paraffins include methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, nonane and decane. Mixtures of paraffins such as those commonly occurring in natural gas reserves may be used if so desired. The molecular oxygen may be substantial y ,g U diluted with other gases, such as nitrogen. Preferably oxygen is used in the form of air. Alternatively the oxygen may be generated t in situ if so desired. As the reducing agent there is used a zerovalent metal. Suitable metals include zinc, iron, cobalt and nickel, of which iron is preferred. The zerovalent metal may suitably be added in a high surface area form, such as the particulate form or the multifilament form, preferably in powder form. In combination with the metal there is used an acid. The acid may be either an inorganic acid or an organic acid, preferably an organic acid. Suitably the inorganic acid may be a mineral acid, such as sulphuric acid or hydrochloric acid. The organic acid may suitably be a carboxylic acid which may be a mono , di , tri , etc, carboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid may suitably be substituted with for example halo groups. Suitable carboxylic acids include formic acid, acetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, lactic acid, picolinic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, diglycolic acid, mucic acid, citric acid and tartaric acid. Preferred carboxylic acids are acetic acid, malonic acid and tartaric acid. As catalyst there may be used any soluble source of iron. Thus there may be used a compound of iron 11 or iron 111 , such as for example ferrous sulphate or ferrous chloride. Alternatively, in a preferred embodiment the iron catalyst is generated in situ by reaction of the acid on zerovalent iron added as reducing agent. The liquid reaction medium may suitably comprise a single solvent selected from oxygenated hydrocarbons, nitrogenous bases and carboxylic acids or may comprise a compatible mixture of two or more solvents selected from the aforesaid solvents and water. Water may be particularly beneficial in certain circumstances. A suitable oxygenated hydrocarbon is acetone. A suitable carboxylic acid is acetic acid. Suitable nitrogenous bases include pyridine, imidazole and tertiary alkylamines, eg triethylamine. Preferred solvents include pyridine, pyridine water, pyridine imidazole and acetone imidazole. The molecular oxygen may be substantially pure oxygen or may be diluted with other gases, such as nitrogen. Preferably oxygen is used in the form of air. Alternatively the oxygen may be generated in situ if so desired. Since the reaction involves both a liquid and a solid phase, a phase transfer agent may be employed. Suitable phase transfer agents are quaternary ammonium salts such as tetraalkylammonium halides. A particularly useful phase transfer agent is tetrabutylanmonium bromide. The nunber of equivalents of acid employed may be at least equal to and is preferably greater than the number of equivalents of zerovalent metal employed in order to ensure that for each electron there must be a corresponding proton. The amount of liquid medium present is not a critical feature of the invention. The process may be operated over a moderately wide temperature range. Generally, temperatures in the range from 40 to 100 C will be found suitable, though higher temperatures may be employed if desired. The process may be operated below 40 C, if so desired, by employing an initiator. Suitable initiators include hydrogen sulphide, sulphur and selenium. Preferably the initiator is hydrogen sulphide which may be added as such or generated in situ by the reaction of acid on a suitable sulphide, eg lithium sulphide, sodium sulphide, calcium sulphide and iron sulphide. The pressure may suitably be atmospheric but subatmospheric and superatmospheric pressures may be employed. Superatmospheric pressure is preferred when using gaseous alkanes.In batch reactions, the reaction period may suitably be less than 25 hours and is preferably less than 20 hours. The reaction may be carried out batchwise or continuously, preferably continuously. In addition to an alcohol or alcohols, an aldehyde or a ketone is generally formed in the reaction. These too are useful products.Depending upon the nature of the paraffinic hydrocarbon reactant, primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols may be formed. The relative proportions of the various components in the product will depend upon a number of factors, including the reaction conditions, the r.atu v, the solvent and the nature and quantity of the acid employed.
