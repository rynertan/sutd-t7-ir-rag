# Microwave thermographic apparatus.

## Abstract
Microwave thermography apparatus comprising a signal receiving aerial 2 which is sensitive to microwave radiation emanating from a body having a mean body temperature. A ref erence load 1 capable of being maintained at a chosen tem perature T₀ and of emitting a thermal noise signal at micro wave frequency corresponding to temperature T₀, is con nected to a receiver 3 the input impedance of which is matched to the impedance of reference load 1 by way of a 3 port non reciprocal circulator 5 . Aerial 2 is connected via a single throw on off microwave switch 6 to the input of re ceiver 3 through the other port of circulator 5 . The connec tions to circulator 5 , taken in circulation order, are reference load 1 , aerial 2 , receiver 3 . Aerial 2 is preferentially de signed to incorporate a tubular metallic waveguide 10 of cir cular cross section dimensioned to support TE₁₁ wave mode and the lower order mode, the signal output from the aerial 2 being taken by a coaxial line and the aerial 2 incorporating a broad band waveguide coaxial line mode transformer 11, 12 which is arranged to select only the TE₁₁ mode for delivery to the coaxial line. The waveguide 10 is filled with a low loss dielectric material 13 in order to provide the aerial 2 with an impedance close to the mean body tissue impedance about 80 ohms .
