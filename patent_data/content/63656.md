## Description
TITLE AN AIR OIL SEPARATORS AND OIL RESERVOIR ASSEMBLY . This invention pertains to air oil separators and to oil reservoirs, for oil flooded gas compressors, and in particular to a unitized assembly which comprises both such a separator and such a reservoir. Oil separation equipment for oil flooded, gas compressors, generally comprises a tank separate from the compressor and joined thereto by external piping.Such oil separation tanks are bulky, expensive and unattractive. Also, oil pumps are generally required to circulate and meter the oil flow to the compression chamber. It is an object of this invention to set forth an improved air oil separator and oil reservoir assembly for an oil flooded compressor system which, by way of example, uses a scroll type compressor, which obviates any need for an external, pipe connected tank, or for an oil pump. It is also an object of this invention to disclose an air oil separator, which also functions as an oil reservoir, and is separably demountable from the compressor housing. This renders the novel assembly easily accessible for maintenance, changing of filters, cleaning, etc. It also enables the assembly to be made of a simple die casting, which greatly reduces the cost of oil separation systems. It is particularly an object of this invention to set forth an air oil separator and oil reservoir assembly for an oil flooded gas compressor, comprising a die cast housing said housing being of substantially dished shape, having a first, substantially uniplanar wall, and a second,perimetrical wall joined to said first wall, about the terminal edges of, and substantially normal to, said first wall said second wall having mounting surfacing formed thereon for replaceably fixing said housing to an end wall of a gas compressor a chordal partition formed in said housing, said partition extending substantially normal from an innermost surface of said first wall, subdividing said housing into a first gas admittance area and a second, air oil separator and oil reservoir area said first wall having a relieved or recessed portion said recessed portion having a gas admittance port formed therein and opening therethrough onto said first area and a gas discharge port in said first wall and opening therethrough and onto said second area. Features of the invention are characterized in this, that the assembly, comprising an oil separator also acts as an oil reservoir and contains an oil filter, air inlet filter and a coalescing type oil separation element. It can also be arranged to contain the suction unloader valve for the gas compressor. Further, no pump is required since the oil reservoir is at discharge pressure and all oil passages to and from the heat exchanger are internal to the machine . Further objects and features of this invention will become more apparent by reference to the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures, in which Figure 1 is an isometric projection of an oilflooded, rotary, gas compressor which, to the foreground end thereof, has an embodiment of the novel air oil separator and oil reservoir assembly replaceably attached and Figure 2 is a vertical, cross sectional view of the novel assembly affixed to a substantially line drawn outline of the gas compressor. As shown in the figures, an embodiment of an air oil separator and oil reservoir assembly 10, which has been die cast, is removably bolted to the inlet discharge end of a rotary, oil flooded compressor 12.The assembly 10 has an external, circular bolting flange 14 formed thereon, and subsisting in a given plane A for attachment purposes. The assembly 10 is defined of a body or housing 16 which is substantially of dished shape, having a first, substantially uniplanar wall 18 to which is joined a second, peripheral wall 20 which terminates in the flange 14. An arcuate partition 22, extending normally from the innermost surface of wall 18, subdivides the inside of the housing 16 into a gas admittance area 24 and an air oil separator and oil reservoir area 26. The outermost surface of wall 18 subsists in a plane B , and a relieved or recessed portion 28 thereof has a planar surface which lies in an intermediate plane C . Through this latter surface there is formed a gas admittance port 30 for communication of the atmosphere with the compressor inlet port 32 via admittance area 24. A gas filter 34 is fixed over port 30, the same being replaceably bolted to portion 28. The relief or recess of portion 28 insures that the filter 34 is unobtrusively confined within the dimension of the novel assembly 10 which obtains between planes A and B . The compressed gas product exits from the compressor 12 via a pipe 36 which discharges into area 26. The oil and air mixture is then throwh out against the walls of area 26 where the large droplets of oil separate and run back into the oil reservoir 38.The air then flows thru a coalescing type oil separator demister 39 which is in the housing 16 and is discharged thru an opening 40. Oil in the reservoir 38 flows, due to the discharge pressure in the area 26, thru an oil filter 42.The oil then travels thru internal passages not shown to the compressor 12. The opening 40 is provided in a shoulder 44 which joins the recessed portion 28 with the outermost portion of wall 18 whereby, again, no obtrusive neck or coupling adapter therefor projects beyond the plane B . Patently, the assembly 10 is readily removable from the compressor 12 for servicing, cleaning, replacement, etc., without requiring disassembly or disabling of the compressor. All compressor toassembly fluid communication can be accommodated with internal conduits, obviating any need for external inter piping. The air filter 34 lends itself to facile servicing, and the oil filter 42 as well. The latter is fixed behind an access plate 46 which covers an access aperture 48 formed in wall 18. While we have described our invention in connection with a specific embodiment thereof, it is to be clearly understood that this is done only by example and not as a limitation of the scope of the invention as set forth in the objects thereof and in the appended claims.
