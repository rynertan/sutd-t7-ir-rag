## Description
DENTAL RESTORATIVE COMPOSITIONS HAVING IMPROVED MECHANICALPROPERTIES AND HYDROLYTIC STABILITYThe invention relates to a dental restorative composition having improved mechanical properties and hydrolytic stability.Background of the InventionDental restorative compositions comprising a polymerizable resinous composition plus a filler are finding wide acceptance in the practice of dentistry. An illustration of such compositions is the dental filling material described by Lee et al. in U.S. Patent No. 3,539,533. However, such resin based dental filling materials have found limited use for the filling of cavities on the grinding surfaces of molars The reason for this is that such compositions have been found to have inadequate wearing properties to withstand the stresses which are normal in such areas.Among the factors that contribute to the inadequate wear properties of the prior art resinous dental restorative dental compositions are microfractures of the overall composite and debonding that occurs at the filler polner matrix interface. Both of these are most likely to occur during the cyclic loads encountered while chewing in an aqueous environment, with modest temperature fluctuations. Inadequate hydrolytic stability appears to contribute to both the microfractures and debonding. The present invention is directed to a dental restorative composition that substantially improves hydrolytic stability, resistance to debonding at the filler polymer interface, and resistance to the formation and propagation of microfractures in the composite.Brief Summary of the InventionThe invention provides a dental restorative dental composition that consists essentially of the following three components a a polymerizable composition containing at least one compound having at least two olefinically unsaturated groups, wherein, when said polymerizable composition is polyme zed in the unfilled state, the resulting cured material has a water absorption as determined by ADASpecification No. 27 at 370C. for one week, of less than 1 milligram per square centimeter b a polymerization initiator for said polymerizable composition and c a particular.hydrophobic inorganic filler having at least 30 per cent of the particles and preferably at least 70 to 100 per cent of the particles less than 5 microns, with a corresponding volume average particle size not more than 15 microns and preferably not more than 5 microns, said filler being present in an amount within the range of from about 35 to about 78 volume per cent, based on volume of said polymerizable composition plus said filler.In a preferred aspect, the composition of the invention contains from about 5 to about 30 weight per cent of colloidal silica, the percentage being based upon the weight of the entire dental restorative composition. The Prior ArtDental restorative compositions that include a polymerizable resinous compound free of active hydrogen have been disclosed. For instance, see Orlowski et al., U.S. PatentNo. 4,220,582, who disclose the use of the dimethacrylate of ethoxylated bisphenol A and polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate in dental restorative compositions.The use in dental restorative compositions of hydrophobic fillers such as quartz has been disclosed. For instance, see Schmitt et al. in U.S. Patent No. 3,923,740.Ibsen et 1., in U.S. Patent No. 4,297,266, disclose dental rstorative composit ions containing hydrophobic colloidal silica and 2 to 30 micron glass particles as fillers. Among the resins disclosed are ethyoxylated bisphenol A dimethacrylate and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate.Dixon, in U.S. Patent No. 4,222,835, teaches polymerizable compositions for coatings or fiber glass reinforced materials containing a wide variety of acrylic esters.Lee et al., in U.S. Patent No. 4,032,504, disclose dental restorative compositions including a filler having a particle size of from 0.5 to about 50 microns, with an average particle size of from about 2 to about 15 microns. Ibsen et al., in U.S. Patent No. 4,297,266, disclosed dental restorative compositions containing glass particles and a hydrophobic silica filler. Rossi, in U.S. Patent No. 3,792,531, contains a similar disclosure. Dental restorative compositions containing sub micron size fillers have also been disclosed. For instance, see Australian Patent No. 484,167.Detailed Description of the InventionIn its broadest aspect, the invention provides a means to obtain a combination of a number of desirable features.First, the polymerizable compositions employed in the invention are relatively hydrophobic when cured, which enhances the hydrolytic stability of the restorative compositions. Second, relatively hydrophobic and chemical urable fillers are employed in order to provide additional resistance to hydrolytic attack at the filler polymer matrix interface. And third, the use of small filler particles at relatively high filler loadings decreases the interparticle spacing in the cured composite which results in an increased number of obstacles to the propagation of small cracks initiated by defects in the system such as voids.In preferred aspects of the invention, the number of voids in the cured composite are reduced by employing relatively low viscosity resinous compounds, and or by mixing the paste system under vacuum and preserving the resultant low void content by the use of a single component photocured system.The various components of the invention, which are described more fully below, are employed for the purpose of achieving the above described features of the invention.The polymerizable composition that is employed as the polymer matrix in the invention is a compound that has at least two olefinically unsaturated groups and which is relatively hydrophobic when cured, as is evidenced by low water absorption. One way to obtain the desired hydrophobic properties is to employ polymerizable compounds that are free of active hydrogen. By active hydrogen is meant the hydrogen contained in groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, primary or secondary amino, amido, sulfhydryl, and the like. A convenient test for such active hydrogen groups is that they react with isocyanate in the presence of tertiary amine catalyst. A wide variety of such compounds can be employed. They include alkoxylated bisphenol A acrylates or methacrylates, alkane diol acrylates or methacrylates, polyalkylene glycol acrylates or methacrylates, and the like.The preferred compounds are the C4 C2 alkane diol acrylates or methacrylates such as 1,10 decamethylene diol dimethacrylate and 1,6hexamethylene diol dimethacrylate, and ethoxylated bisphenol A dimethacrylate. The nature and preparation of such compounds are known in the art.The dental restorative composition of the invention includes a polymerization initiator. Such initiators are known in the art and can be used in their customary proportions. For instance, the composition can be divided, one package containing a peroxide such as benzoyl peroxide, and the other containing an activator for the perox ide such as N,N di 2 hydroxyethyl p toluidene. Other initiator systems known in the art can also being used. In order to minimize the formation of voids, in a preferred aspect of the invention, the initiator is a photosensitive initator system so that the mixing step necessary for the two component, self curing composite systems can be avoided. In this aspect, a one package system is used. Resin, filler, and the photosensitive initiator system are mixed under a vacuum to reduce void formation. The composition then needs no further mixing by the dentist or dental technician. Such photosensitive initiator systems include benzoin, benzoin ethers and esters, 2,2 diethoxy acetophenone, and the diketone compounds plus a reducing agent that are disclosed by Dart et al., in U.S. Patent No. 4,071,424.Specific examples of preferred photoinitiator systems include benzil and or camphoroquinone plus N,N dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate or ethyl 4 N,N dimethylamino benzoate. The filler employed in the invention has a volume average particle size below 15 microns, and preferably, below 5 microns. Thirty per cent of the filler particles, and preferably 70 to 100 per cent, have a size below 5 microns. The filler is employed in an amount within the range of from about 35 to about 78 volume per cent, based on the volume of the filler plus the polymerizable composition. Thus, the filler is employed in relatively high proportions. A volume per cent of 35.to 78 corresponds approximately to 50 to 95 weight per cent of the dental restorative composition of the invention, depending on the specific gravity of the filler.The hydrophobic, chemically durable fillers that are used are quartz and or a particular heat treated barium or strontium glass. The hydrophobic fillers will absorb less than 0.1 weight per cent water prior to addition of silane coupling agent when exposed to normal ambient conditions. Water content of the filler is determined by a differential scanning calorimeter DSC . The first departure from baseline in a DSC scan is caused by the presence of water. To determine the amount present, the area under the peak is determined and normalized relative to the weight of the sample. The barium or strontium glass that may be employed as the filler is selected for chemical durability, as is evidenced by resistance to leaching in an aqueous environment. Such glasses are substantially free of alkali metal oxides, and are single phase glasses. If the mole per cent of barium or strontium oxide exceeds a certain point, the glass becomes two phased. This proportion can vary, depending upon the presence and proportion of other metal oxides in the glass. For one preferred type of glass that is composed of oxides of barium, silicon, boron, and aluminum, the upper limit for a single phase glass is about 20 mole per cent barium oxide.One preferred glass for use in the invention has the following composition SiO2 67 mole per centBaO 16.4 mole per cent B2 o3 10 mole per cent A1203 6.6 mole per centThe essential ingredients in the glass are the oxides of barium and or strontium and silicon. Oxides of other metals such as aluminum and boron may also be present so long as such oxides do not detract from the chemical durability of the glass. Thus, significant quantities of alkali metal oxides should be avoided because, as is well known, alkali metal ions are quite soluble in aqueous media, and therefore will reduce the chemical durability of the glass. The minimum barium and or strontium content of the glass is preferably that which is sufficient to impart x ray opacity to the glass. The barium and or strontium glass powder used in the invention is acid washed and then subjected to a heat treatment to enhance its resistance to attack by water.The procedures are the following The acid washing treatment to which the glass powder is subjected is carried out by known procedures. For instance, a mixture of 1 part by weight of glass powder, 1 part of 37 per cent aqueous hydrochloric acid, and l part of deionized water is.stirred at room temperature for 45 minutes, filtered, and rinsed with de ionized water until the pH of the filtrate is the same as the rinse water. The powder is then dried at about 50 C, overnight in a forced air oven. The acid wash is used to remove metal impurities from the glass, and to reduce the amount of leachable barium or strontium from the surface of the glass.The acia washed glass powder is subjected to a heat treatment to reduce the affinity of the glass powder for water. This heat treatment is carried out at an elevated temperature below the sintering temperature of the glass powder the sintering temperature can be determined by known procedures, as by thermo mechanical analysis TMAn , but high enough to cause a significant reduction in the specific surface area of the glass powder, as measured by known procedures such as by a nQuantasorb B.E.T. surface area analyzer The reduction in specific surface area will usually be at least 50 per cent i.e., the surface area of.the heat treated glass powder will be less than about one half that of the untreated powder , up to 80 to 90 per cent, or even more in some cases.The heat treatment time is not at all critical in that it need be carried out only for the minimum time needed to heat all the powder to the desired temperature. Apparently the effect of the heat on the glass powder is quite rapid, and all that is required is to bring all of the mass of powder up to the desired temperature. However, since the glass powder is an excellent heat insulator, this can take several hours for masses of powder wherein the heat must travel through a significant thickness of powder to heat all of the glass to the desired temperature.The following is an illustration of a preferred heat treatment carried out on the barium glass used below in the Examples, and referred to as Filler A or Filler B The barium glass had the following composition Si02 67 mole per centBaO 16.4 mole per cent Bz03 10 mole per cent Al2 03 6.6 mole per centThe raw glass powder, prior to acid wash, has a specific surface area of about 0.8 0.1 m gm. After acid washing as described above, the specific surface area is about 10 2 mZ gm. Five kilograms of the acid washed powder are placed in a saggar crucible. The crucible is cylindrical, about 12 inches in diameter and 10 inches high. Five kilograms of the powder nearly fill the crucible. The crucible containing the powder is placed in an oven, which is set at 6500C. It takes about 16 hours for the entire mass of powder to heat up to 650 C. After 16 hours, the furnace is turned off and the powder is slowly cooled to room temperature. The specific surface area of the heat treated glass is about 3.5 1 m2 gm. As is known in the art, a silane coupling agent can be employed to enhance the bond between the filler and the resin. Such coupling agents include gamma methacryloxy propyltrimethoxysilane.It is desirable to include a small percentage of colloidal silica in the composition in order to adjust tha viscosity and the handling characteristics of the composite paste.For instance, from about 2 to about 25 weight per cent of colloidal silica, based on weight of the entire composite, is beneficial.The colloidal silica is preferably treated with a silane coupling agent such at samma methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilicone A 174 . After such treatment1 the silica should be protected from ambient moisture because it may absorb up to about 1 weight per cent of water from the atmosphere, as measured by DSC.In the examples, the following materials were used Bisphenol A dimethacrylate BADM Ethoxylated bisphenol A dimethacrylate EBDM Methacrylic acid MAA 1,6 hexamethylene glycol dimethacrylate HMGDM 2,2 propane bis 3 4 phenoxy 2 hydroxypropyl l methacrylate Bis GMA Tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate BEGUM 2 N,N dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate DMAEMA.

The quartz fillers were treated with 3.2 weight per cent A 174 silane Union Carbide , and the barium glass fillers were treated with 1 weight per cent A 174 silane gamma methacryloxypropyl trimethoxy silane Examples 1 2 and Controls 1 3A series of filled resin systems, formulated to be useful as dental composites, were prepared. The composite formulations were prepared by mixing fillers into the resins using a mini Hobart drill mixer until a smooth paste resulted. The pastes were then placed in a vacuum oven and de gassed at about 4 mm. mercury pressure until they were void free, as determined by microscopic examination.Flexural test samples were made by placing the uncured filled resins in Teflon molds between glass slides, and exposing each side to 60 seconds exposure fron a 75 watt l2 volt quartz projector lamp. All samples were aged for 24 hours at 370C. in deionized water. Ten samples of each composite were tested for initial flexural strength, and ten additional samples were placed in pressure bottles with 300 ml. of deionized water, and were held at about 5 atmospheres and 145 C. for 7 days. After this time, they were removed from the bottles and tested for flexural strength, using an Instron HP ll stressstrain testing apparatus.Table I displays the formulations and Table II displays the results of the flexural testing.

The mixture is then charged to a double planetary mixer, which is kept at an absolute pressure of 65 millimeters of mercury. The agitators in this mixer are run for about 20 seconds every 15 minutes the mixture is kept in the mixer for 1 1 4 hours.Samples were cured by exposure to light, as described inExample 1.

The flexural modulus of natural tooth enamel is of the order of 50,000 to 80,000 N mm2. Where there is a large difference between the flexural moduli of natural enamel and the restoration, significant stresses can be encountered at the enamel restoration interface. One of the reasons that polymer based dental conposites may not function well in Class 2 restorations i.e., on biting surfaces of molars is the large disparity between their flexural moduli which can be as low as 7000 N mmz and that of natural tooth enamel. While the inventor herein has observed isolated batches of conventional composite material whose flexural moduli have approached that of this Example 6, preferred embodiments of the restorative compositions of this invention are the first composite formulations that the inventor has seen whose properties, including flexural modulus, are consistently such that they are legitimate canditates for clinical evaluation as Class 2 restorative materials.
