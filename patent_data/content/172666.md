# A robot gripper system.

## Abstract
A resilient gripper pad 3 stores deformation energy just before a gripped object 8 starts to slip, then rapidly accelerates as it suddenly releases the energy as it springs back to its rest position. Accelerometers 1, 2 in the resilient pad 3 and a non resilient pad 4 , respectively, provide information which is used by a control system 5, 6 to effect the manipulation of the object 8 by controlled slipping. Prior to the slide, there is an instant when the gripped object starts to slip on a slip pad on one digit of the gripper, but remains frictionally gripped by a resilient pad on the opposing digit. During this instant, the resilient pad deforms downwards because of gravity on the gripped oblect. Next, when the gripping force relaxes just a little more, the object slides free and the resilient pad springs back to its rest position. A computer 6 manipulates signals related to motion experience of the gripper grip or release and detection or absence of springback acceleration, deter mines gripping, slipping or sliding status, and determines the appropriate gripper action.
