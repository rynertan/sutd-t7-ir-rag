## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to water based lubricant compositions and a method of using such compositions. More particularly, the invention discloses aqueous compositions containing a long chain phosphate ester which are useful for the lubrication of continuously moving conveyor systems, particularly conveyor systems used in the packaging of materials intended for human consumption. Continuously moving conveyor systems employed in food and beverage packaging operations require both cleansing and lubrication to insure that the systems function properly in moving items between packaging stations. For example, in those conveyor systems employed in bottling and capping operations, a clean and properly lubricated conveyor surface permits stoppage of the bottles during the filling and capping operations while the conveyor track continues to move underneath.If the track is not clean or does not have the proper lubricity, the containers may be knocked over or fail to stop moving, resulting both in bottle breakage and in disruption of the bottling line. These cleansing and lubricating functions are customarily accomplished by circulating an aqueous dispersion or solution of a water based material across the track surface. Various surface active agents have been employed as lubricants in food packaging processes, including long chain fatty acid soaps, sulfonated oils, and alkanolamides. Of particular interest to the present inven tion is the water soluble agent of U.S. Patent 3,574,100 which claims a track lubricant composition comprising a mixture of an imidazoline derivative and an alkali metal salt of the phosphate esters of oleyl alcohol ethoxylate. The specific phosphate ester salt disclosed in the 3,574,100 patent is a material manufactured byGeneral Aniline and Film Corporation under the trade name, Gafac GB520, Gafac GB520 is the partial sodium salt of a mixture of mono and di alkyl phosphate esters derived from an oleyl alcohol polyethoxylate having eight to nine ethoxy groups, together with 35 percent of unreacted oleyl alcohol ethoxylate, i.e., H3C CH2 7 CH CH CH2 7 CH O CH2CH2 89H. The mole ratio of phosphate diester to phosphate monoester in the Gafac GB520 material is greater than 3 to 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The novel lubricants of the present invention are aqueous compositions, at least partially neutralized with a base, preferably comprising two active components.The first of these active ingredients is a mono alkyl phosphate ester of the formula EMI3.1 The second of the active ingredients is a synergist taken from the group A an alcohol of the formula R doCH2CH2tm OH B an amine oxide of the formulaEMI3.2 C urea. The lubricant compositions also contain minor amounts of di alkyl phosphate ester and phosphoric acid.In the above formulae R and R are liner saturated primary alkyl groups, C14 through C18, or linear partially unsaturated primary alkylene groups, C16 throughC20. R and R can also comprise a mixture of saturated or unsaturated alkyl groups C12 through C20, having an average chain length in the range C13 through C18. R is a mixture of saturated and unsaturated alkyl groupsC8 through C18 having an average chain length C12 throughC18 i.e., products derived from fatty acids such as coco oil and tallow . The value of m and n can be zero through three. We have discovered that while lubricating compositions employing phosphate monoesters as the sole active ingredient exhibit good lubricity, the use of an alcohol, an amine oxide, or a urea synergist with the phosphate ester greatly improves the performance of the lubricant composition, particularly in the area of durability. Although the addition of other materials, such as surfactants, can improve the lubricant formulations, excellent compositions can be prepared wherein the sole active components comprise a neutralized aqueous dispersion of a two component system containing a monophosphate ester and one of the synergist compositions described above. These lubricant compositions exhibit excellent lubricity at concentrations as low as .01 percent.The use of higher concentrations, i.e., .05 to .1 percent is generally preferred, however, because it results in greater durability for the applied material. The phosphate esters of the present invention can be prepared in a conventional manner. For example, a C14 triethoxyphosphate was synthesized by reacting a C14 C15 linear primary alcohol mixture NeodolR45 with three moles of ethylene oxide and then phosphorylating the resultant ethoxylate with polyphosphoric acid at a temperatue of approximately 65 80 C. The product comprised monophosphate ester, unreacted ethoxylated alcohol, phosphoric acid, and diester. Other methods of obtaining phosphate esters are illustrated in the prior art, i.e., U.S. Patents 1,970,578, 2,174,271, 2,167,326 and 3,033,889. It is generally desirable to limit the formation of diester product in the reaction mixture. The diesters are approximately twice the molecular weight of the monoesters and do not add to the system s lubricating properties. Thus, based on cost considerations, the diester content should be kept to a minimum, preferably less than 15 percent of the active mono ester ingredient. This can be accomplished by employing an excess of phosphoric acid in the reaction. If desired, additional amounts of long chain alcohol or alcohol ethoxylate can be added to the product after cooling. In view of the fact that the compositions of the present invention typically contain free phosphoric acid as well as the acidic monophosphate ester, the lubricant compositions would have an undesirably low acid pH were they not partially neutralized. Moreover, it has been found that neutralization results in better dispersibility of the compositions in water.Neutralization can be accomplished by the addition of any suitable base, but the use of NH3, NH4OH, or a basic aminofunctional material is generally preferred. Although the lubricity of the ester compositions remains relatively constant over a range of pH values, the durability of the composition peaks at a pH t 5 6, the pK range for neutralization of the first hydroxyl group in mono alkyl phosphate esters. If the neutralization is continued to a pH 9 the pK range for the second hydroxyl neutralization , there is a fall off in product durability. Thus optimum properties in terms of durability are obtained with partial neutralization, whereby the resultant composition has a pH in the range 5.0 to 7.0, ideally pH 6.0. However, good lubricity can be obtained with compositions of higher pH values in the range 6.5 to 10, preferably 7.0 10.0. sse applications may warrant a partial sacrifice of product durability in order to obtain the benefit of a mildly basic lubricant. For example, formulations having a basic pH can resist acidic beverage spills e.g., beer without any major deterioration in lubricity. Moreover, basic pH 8.0 to 10.0 compositions are generally desirable where it is necessary to incorporate a sequestering agent in the lubricant to overcome problems resulting from water hardness. As previously indicated, the long chain saturated alkyl or partially unsaturated alkylene substituent groups of the phosphate esters may contain up to three ethoxy groups in the chain. The presence of these groups increases the dispersibility of the ester in water but at some sacrifice in lubricity.Therefore, while the lubricant performance of a typical monophosphate ester increases with the length of the alkyl chain, saturated alkyl groups longer than C15 tend to be too insoluble to be easily formulated, absent some degree of ethoxylation. Increasing the ethylene oxide content increases solubility but reduces lubricating ability. A preferred ester representing a compromise between lubricating per formance and solubility for saturated R groups is the phosphate ester,EMI6.1 where R is a 50 50 mixture of C14H29 and C15H31 alkyl groups. The performance of the lubricant compositions is improved by the presence of a free long chain alcohol, a long chain alcohol ethoxylate, a fatty acidderived amine oxide, or urea. Although these additives provide no lubricity by themselves, their presence in the lubricating formulation serves as a synergist, improving both the lubricity and, in particular, the durability of the compositions. While even a minor amount of these additives serves to improve the properties of the lubricants, optimum results are obtained when the long chain monoester synergist ratio is in the range of 1 1.5 on a molar basis. If an alcohol is used as the synergist, the alcohol can be the reactant precursor of the phosphate ester, and thus R and R will be the same. However, this identity is not necessary and desirable lubricant compositions can be formulated utilizing various combinations of alcohol and phosphate ester which differ either in the length or in the nature saturated unsaturated, ethoxylated non ethoxylated of the linear longchain substituant group. The amine oxide synergist employed in certain species of the invention is an ethoxylated polyoxyethylene fatty amine, characteristically derived from a natural product such as coco oil, tallow, soybean oil, and the like. Particularly useful compounds include bis 2 hydroxyethyl cocoamine oxide and bis 2 hydroxyethyl tallow amine oxide. The inclusion of a sequesterant such as ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid EDTA in the lubricant composition renders the phosphate ester formulations resistant to the formation of insoluble precipitates when used in hard water formulations. The phosphate ester containing lubricants are generally applied at very low levels of concentration, i.e., between about 1.0 X 10 3 and 3.0 X 10 3 M, based on the monophosphate ester. It is therefore desirable to supply the lubricants in the form of liquid concentrates which can be further diluted with water prior to use. Concentrates containing about 10 percent by weight of monophosphate ester can be formulated by blending the phosphate ester, synergist and other desired ingredients at elevated temperatures 30 500C in an isopropanol water mixture and neutralizing to a pH of 5.0 6.5 with a base. Lower molecular weight phosphate esters so formulated will remain stable at room temperature.Higher molecular weight concentrates may solidify when cooled to ambient temperature, but can be re liquified by heating to 30 400C. The concentrates are diluted prior to use, typically in the ratio one part concentrate to 100 to 200 parts water. The compositions are applied to the surface of moving conveyor systems so that the surface of the conveyor does not become dry. This may be accomplished by passing the conveyor through a dip or trough containing a dilute solution of the lubricant, by brushing or roller coating the lubricant composition on the surface of the conveyor, or by other conventional means. The preferred method of application, however, utilizes spray nozzles spaced along the conveyor track to ensure the proper degree of lubricity. No matter how the material is applied, it is important that the conveyor system remain consistently wet. As noted above, the lubricant compositions may be improved by u se of surfactants and or sequesterants. Preferred surfactants are long chain anionic materials such as the sodium salt of sulfonated oleic acid. Should the lubricant concentrate be d iluted with hard water, a highly dispersed suspension may form, giving the product a cloudy appearance. The fine suspension may in time agglomerate and accumulate in the spray nozzles, causing them to block. The use of a sequestering agent is desirable to control the hardness. In view of the fact that sequestering agents such as EDTA perform most efficiently at pH of 8.0 or more, it may be desirable to supply the lubricant concentration at a sufficiently high pH 8.0 10 to enable the sequestering agent to operate at maximum efficiency. As has been previously mentioned, however, this increase in pH may result in some loss in the product s durability. The lubricity and durability of the lubricant compositions reported in the following examples was measured on a pilot test track, approximately 19 cm wide by 305 cm long. The track, a slat conveyor manufactured of 304 stainless steel, was operated at a speed of 40 cm sec. Friction measurements were measured with a 0 5 pound precision load cell manufactured by Transducers, Inc. Model C462 . The output from the load cell was connected to a Sigma variable speed strip chart recorder, permitting measurements of coefficient of friction p vs. time. A constant load, consisting of eight filled bottles connected to the load cell by a loop of fine wire, was utilized in the experiments. Lubricant c9m positions were applied in spurts to the test track with a feed pump, via a fan spray nozzle. The pump and nozzle could be adjusted to vary both the frequency of the spurts and the volume of material delivered. In each of the following examples a spurt rate of 36 minute and a solution volume of 32 mL minute was employed. The test was initiated by activating the feed pump and starting the test track and recorder in motion. The measured coefficient of friction was observed to drop over a period of time to a constant equilibrium value it , the value depending on the lubricity of the applied material. Because lubricity has an inverse relationship to friction, the lower the value of , the better the lubricant. The pilot test track was also used to measure the durability of the lubricant compositions. This was accomplished by replacing the intermittant stream of lubricant applied to the track with a constant stream of water. At the same time, a weighted fiberglass cloth 5000 gms, width ll cm was placed on the track to increase the wear rate. The time required for the coefficient of friction to increase from the lubricated equilibrium value to the original friction value represents the durability of the test lubricant. The greater the time, the better the durability. The reported data for coefficients of friction represent measurements taken five minutes after the initial activation of the feed pump and test track to ensure that a constant equilibrium had been obtained.Immediately after making this measurement, the flow of lubricant was replaced with a water stream and the durability test was commenced. In interpreting the following data, the optimum products are those which exhibit both low equilibrium coefficients of friction and high durability times. Except as otherwise indicated, all formulations were diluted in distilled water to 2.2 X 10 3 M based on the weight of the ester. All ratios are expressed in terms of weight, unless otherwise indicated. Finally, although the following examples illustrate the present invention, they should not be construed as limiting the invention to their details.

Upon cooling the product was analyzed and found to contain 38.2 percent monoester, 11.5 percent H3PO4, 50.3 percent unreacted alcohol, and no measurable diester. The phosphate ester was separated from the unreacted alcohol by dissolving approximately 25 g of the above product in 50 mL of warm isopropyl alcohol and stirring the mixture with heating until a clear solution was obtained. The pH of the solution was adjusted to approximately 6.5 by the addition of concentrated NH40H dilute solutions should be avoided due to the ester s solubility in H20 . This resulted in the formation of a white precipitate which was digested at 400C for 45 minutes. The solution was cooled to 200C, filtered through a buchner funnel, washed with cold IPA, and the precipitate dried.The residue the ammonium salts of the phosphate ester and polyphosphoric acid was dissolved in water to form a 2.2 X 10 3 M lubricant composition based on the phosphate ester, and applied to the test track in the manner previously described. The durability and lubricity of the composition was measured and recorded. The results are set forth at Ex 1A in Table I. A second sample of the phosphate ester unreacted alcohol product of the first reaction was formulated into a lubricant without removal of the unreacted alcohol.This was accomplished by adding 25 g of material 38 parts ester 50 parts alcohol to 250 ml of a 10 90 IPA H20 solution, and heating the mixture to 350C, with stirring. The pH of the dispersion was adjusted to 6.5 by the addition of diethanol amine DEA , and then dilluted with distilled water to form a 2.2 X 10 3 M lubricant composition based on the phosphate ester.The composition was applied to the test track and its durability and lubricity measured and recorded. The results are set forth at Ex 1B in Table I. Example II C12C15 triethoxylated monoester A commercially available phosphated ester composition Alkaphos 3, Alkaril Chemicals Ltd. , was formulated into a track lubricant composition.

Twenty five 25 grams of the product was dispersed in 250 ml of a 10 90 IPA H20 solution, neutralized to pH 6.5 with DEA, and diluted to 2.2 X 10 M with distilled water in the same manner as the ester alcohol material of Example 1. The results of the composition as a track lubricant are set forth atEx 2 of Table 1. Example III C14Cl5 non ethoxylated monoester A phosphated monoester was prepared from aC14C15 linear primary alcohol mixture by following the procedure of Example 1. Analysis revealed the product to contain 41.8 percent monoester, 10.7 percent H3PO4, 47.5 percent unreacted alcohol, and no measurable diester. A portion of the product was dissolved in 30 70IPA H20, neutralized to pH 6.5 with DEA, diluted to 2.2 X 10 3 M in distilled water and tested on the pilot track. The results appear at Ex 3A of Table I. Another portion of the above product was treated so as to isolate the phosphate ester from the nonreacted alcohol in accordance with the separation step of Example 1. The isolated, partially neutralized ester acid mixture was tested on the pilot track by itself Ex 3B , and in combination with a number of long chain alcohols and alcohol ethoxylates Exs 3C 3H . In all cases, the C14 C15 phosphate ester containing lubricant was diluted to 2.2 X 10 3 M, based on the ester content, prior to testing. Example IV Oleyl diethoxy monoester An oleyl alcohol diethoxylate was prepared by reacting oleyl alcohol CH3 CH2 7CH CH CH2 7CHOHi with ethylene oxide in a 1 to 2 molar ratio. The reaction was carried out by charging the oleyl alcohol and a sodium hydroxide catalyst into an autoclave, heating the autoclave to 1400 C, and gradually adding ethylene oxide gas. The pressure was maintained at 25 to 30 p.s.i. during the reaction. The resultant oleyl alcohol diethoxylate was reacted with polyphosphoric acid by following the procedure of Example 1. Analysis revealed the product to be 42 percent phosphate monoester, 8 percent H3PO4, and 50 percent alcohol ethoxylate diester. A portion of the product was dissolved in 30 70 IPA H20, neutral ized to pH 6.5 with DEA, diluted to 2.2 X 10 M in distilled water and tested on the pilot track.

The analysis showed the product to be partially neutralized with NaOH. The degree of ethoxylation of the oleyl alcohol alkylene substituent was determined to be between 8 and 9, and the ratio of phosphate diester to phosphate monoester to be in excess of 4 to 1. Unreacted ethoxylated alcohol was found to constitute approximately 35 percent by weight of the solids ingredients. The GB520 was formulated into a 2.2 X 10 M track lubricant composition, based on the weight of the total ester. The results of the pilot track test utilizing this material are reported at Ex 5 of Table 1. As evident from these results, the composition exhibited poor durability and lubricity.

A second lubricant composition was prepared, as above, but employing a higher level of urea 20 grams .The results are recorded at Ex 8B of Table I. Example IX Long chain alkylene phosphate esters were formulated into track lubricant compositions in accordance with the procedures of Example 1 through VIII. The results of the test of these compositions on a pilot test track are summarized in Table I, Exs 9 and 10. Example X Effect of pH In order to test the effect of pH on lubricant properties, a track lubricant concentrate was formulated as follows EMI24.1 Nonionic Alcohol 1.0Isopropanol 12.0Urea 15.0Water soft 60.4Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetic Acid Disodium.2H20 1.0Methanolamine MEA or KOH 2.6 The amount and nature of the base was altered to obtain different pH s. With 2.6 MEA, pH 8.0. Track lubricant compositions were prepared from concentrates having a range of pH from 8.0 through 11.0, and applied to the test track in the manner previously described. The lubricity and durability of these compositions are set forth in Table II. TABLE II pH pH 1 250 Concentrate Soft WaterExample Formula Dilution Durability p A 8.0 7.6 6.50 0.145 B 9.0 8.3 6.50 0.147 C 10.0 9.2 5.50 0.155 D 10.0 KOH 9.2 4.01 0.147 E 11.0 KOH 9.3 3.21 0.142 It can be noted that the coefficient of friction p stays relatively constant with increase in pH, and that durability decreases with further increase in pH. In certain applications, i.e., where the lubricant is applied substantially constantly to the conveyor track, a relatively low level of durability may be satisfactory. Example XI Resistance to beverage spills The resistance of the lubricant compositions to acidic beverage spills such as those generally found in beer bottling halls was tested utilizing the formulation of Example X, partially neutralized with MEA and thereafter diluted with soft water 250 1 to a pH of 7.8. Forty beer bottles were placed on the clean pilot test track and the test track apparatus adjusted as previously outlined. In an effort to simulate a heavily used track surface as found in a commerical bottling facility, the track was operated at a speed of 40 cm sec. for a period of two hours with lubricant supplied throughout at a rate of 41 mL minute. At the end of the two hour equilibration period, with the track and the lubricant feed still running, the effect of eight test bottles interconnected with a precision load cell was measured for 4Y2 minutes. The equilibrium coefficient of friction was found to be p 0.154. After the above equilibrium measurement was completed, the flow of lubricant to the track was supplemented with a spray of water to determine the effect of dilution on the lubricant composition. Water was sprayed onto the track through a nozzle, upstream of the eightbottle load, at a rate of 103 mt minute using a peristaltic pump. Measurements were taken over a 4 minute period and the water dilution coefficient of friction was found to be p 0.159. Flow of water was stopped and the coefficient of friction was again measured over a period of 4 minutes p 0.159. The effect of a beer spill was determined by applying a supplemental spray of beer pH 4.1 to the track in the same manner as the water spray in the preceeding water dilution step, but at a rate of 55 mL minute. The pH of the combined beer and lubricant spray on the track was determined to be pH 4.5. The coefficient of friction, measured over a 7 minute period, was observed initially to rise 0.167 and then to fall 0.159 . Thereafter, the spray of beer to the test track was stopped and the lubricant alone applied. The lubricity was found to increase somewhat 0.152 .
