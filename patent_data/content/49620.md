# Plural imaging component microcellular elements and processes for their preparation.

## Abstract
A process for forming microcellular imaging elements comprising a support having first and second major sur faces, a planar array of microcells 1 to 200 microns in width opening toward the first major surface, which comprises selectively introducing a first imaging composition into a first set of microcells, and a second, differing imaging composition into a second set of microcells forming an interlaid pattern with said first set of mtcrocells, characte rized in that the portion of the support 100 having the microcells 102 is photoconductive, and in that an electros tatic charge pattern is established on said support differen tiating said first and second sets of microcells, and a first electrographic imaging composition is introduced selectively into the first set of microcells. The support optionally has an electrically conductive layer 116 .
