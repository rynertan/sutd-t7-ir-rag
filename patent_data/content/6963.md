# Method of producing glass mats using novel glass fiber dispersion composition.

## Abstract
This invention describes an aqueous, glass fiber disper sion composition for making uniform, high strength glass mats which comprises a plurality of glass fibers dispersed in an aqueous system comprising an effective amount of an amine oxide and a derivatized guar gum. A wet laid process for making such mats using said dis persion composition also is described.
