# High solids curable resin coating composition.

## Abstract
A high solids curable polymer resin coating composition comprising mixed ether aminoplasts containing C₈ to C₁₂ al koxymethyl and methoxymethyl groups and a hydroxy con taining resin. The coating composition provides improved intercoat adhesion and cross link density. Examples of the hydroxy containing resin are acrylic, alkyd and polyester res ins.
