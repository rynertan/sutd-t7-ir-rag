# Process for producing sintered silicon nitride base body.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a process for producing a sintered silicon nitride base body, which comprises mixing powder A of heat treated or not heat treated silicon nitride powder and powder B of powder obtained by heat treating a powdery mixture of silicon nitride powder and a sintering additive in non oxidizing atmosphere and then grinding the resulting heat treated products into powder and forming the resultant powdery mixture into a desired shape, which is then sintered in a non oxidizing atmosphere. The process is characterized by heating powder B , or powder A and powder B , before sintering, thereby producing sintered silicon nitride body of highly improved properties.
