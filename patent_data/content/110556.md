# TWO HIGH HOT ROLLING MILL PROCESS AND NARROW STRIP PRODUCT

## Abstract
A rolling mill capable of forming a hot, continuously cast metallic strand into a strip with a large bite and with one pass per mill stand uses only two small diameter rolls per stand, each mounted for rotation in a pair of chock blocks and each having a comparatively narrow, enlarged diameter working portion. The outer surface of the working portion is profiled to maintain the product centered on the rolls and to accommodate for thermal expansion. An hy draulic motor that produces a large torque at a low rotation al speed with good control rotates each roll. The motors are coupled to their associated rolls directly. A pair of hydraulic cylinders mounted on upper frame beams are each con nected to one of the chock blocks of the upper roll. The up per frame and the cylinders pivot together to provide a di rect overhead access to the rolls and their chock blocks for a rapid replacement of the rolls. The mill includes rotary brushes that are adjustably loaded against the working por tions of the rolls to remove adhered strand material and to prevent a release agent from accumulating on the rolls. An entrance guide assembly provides a partial atmosphere control and edge rolls that to some extent steer the strand to the center of the rolls. A narrow strip with a recrystallised grain pattern and accurately controlled dimensions is pro duced by three such two high mills operating in tandem. The first mill produces the high reduction and sets the width of the strip. The second mill reduces the thickness further. The third mill is a finishing mill that produces a final thickness reduction.
