# An aromatic polyamide fiber based composite prepreg.

## Abstract
The resin impregnated composite prepreg based on a fab ric material of an aromatic polyamide fiber is prepared by ex posing the fabric material to low temperature plasma generat ed in an atmosphere of an inorganic gas, which is preferably oxygen or an oxygen containing gaseous mixture, under a pressure of 0.5 to 5 Torr to such an extent that ruggedness of 0.01 to 0.5 Âµm is formed on the surface and then impregnating the fabric material with an organic resinous binder. The adhe sive bonding strength between the binder and the fiber surface can further be increased when the plasma treated fabric ma terial is brought into contact with an unsaturated compound polymerizable by free radical polymerization without contact ing with air so as to form a graft polymerized layer on the fiber surface.
