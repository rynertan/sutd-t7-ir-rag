# Radio wave transmission system of keyless entry system for automotive vehicle devices.

## Abstract
A keyless entry system allows operation of door locks, a trunk lid lock, glove box lid lock, a steering lock device or so forth without mechanical keys. The keyless entry system includes electrically disconnected transmitter 100 and a controller 200 . The controller 200 is connected to operate the devices 220 . The transmitter 100 is adapted to send a present code indicative radio signal to the con troller 200 , which then compares the code contained in the radio signal from the transmitter with a preset code. The controller 200 is provided with a dual antenna system which ensures clear data transmission between the trans mitter 100 and the controller 200 . The dual antenna sys tem includes at least a pair of antennas 214, 215 oriented essentially perpendicular to each other.
