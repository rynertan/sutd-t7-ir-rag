# Diaphragm for an electro acoustic transducer.

## Abstract
A diaphragm for an electro acoustic transducer compris es a sheet obtained by the melt processing of a mixture of a polymer and mica comprising a 30 to 95 by weight of a polymer whose major component is at least one olefin, polyester or polyamide or a mixture of such polymers, and b 5 to 70 by weight of mica having a weight average flake diameter of 500 microns at maximum and a weight average aspect ratio of at least 10. Addition of the specified mica improves the dynamic modulus of the sheet without sub stantially changing its loss tangent, so that the sheet provides an excellent diaphragm.
