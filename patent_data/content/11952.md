# Method and apparatus for testing enclosed electromagnetic relays.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for testing enclosed electromagne tic relays 14 includes a probe 17 displaceable into the relay enclosure to engage the movable contract 14b thereof. The probe is associated with a force transducer 16 and a displace ment transducer 20 which provide inputs to a circuit including microprocessor unit, which operates to detect the probe force required to break contact between the movable contact 14b and the normally closed contact, and to detect the position of the probe when such break occurs and when the normally open contact is made and to calculate the contact travel from the position signals it receives. Contact over travel is also measured by applying current to the relay winding and measuring probe displacement required to re engage the contact.
