Attitude control apparatus 18, 20 for an automotive ve hicle 10 in which motive fluid is supplied to attitude control nozzles 22, 24 . The nozzles 22, 24 are arranged in two pairs, each pair consisting of two oppositely directed nozzles through one or other of which the fluid is selectively expelled, whereby substantially simultaneous operation of one nozzle from each pair in opposite directions effects an attitude change about the roll axis 26 while substantially simultaneous opera tion of one nozzle from each pair in the same direction effects an attitude change about one of the yaw axis and the pitch axis.
