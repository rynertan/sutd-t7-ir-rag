# COUPLING AGENT SYSTEM OF ALUMINIUM

## Abstract
The present invention relates to aluminate coupling agents, their synthesis and appliations. metallic aluminum is reacted with lower alcohols, then reacted with selected longer chain alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acids etc., satisfied the coordination number of aluminum to give aluminate coupling agents having good hydrolytic stability and lower associativity.

## Description
The present invention relates to aluminate coupling agents, their syntheses and applications. Coupling agent is also called adhesive promoter or surface primer. Typical coupling agent is a kind of chemical materials or products which contains at least two chemical radicals in tis molecule and can react with two different phases of materials in certain mixed or adherent systems to combine the two phases tightly together physically or physico chemically. Over the last thirty years, coupling agents were used widely for plastics, rubber, coating, adhesives, toughened glassfibre reinforced plastics, laminates, printing ink, shoe polish, electric products, textile fabric and surface modification for various materials and so on. In these respects, coupling agents and their application have played a role in the improvement of quality, developement of products, improvement of process properties, reduction of energy consume and cost, and provided a new route for their applications. Therefore, coupling agents become all the more a kind of important products and auxiliaries in fine chemical industry. In the fifties of this century, chromium systems coupling agent represent by Volan series have been created U.S.P. 352740 . Afterwards, volan has not been significantly developed due to the toxicity of cromium ion and enviroment pollution caused by it almost at the same time, created silicon system coupling agent represented by aminosilane J.G. Masdenet et. al., Adherends and Bonding technology Section C, p.462 652 . In the seventies of this century, kenrich Petrochemical of U.S.A. had synthesized successfully titanium coupling agent represented by TTS S. J. Monte et. al. 32nd Annual Technical Conference. Section 4 E, 1977, p.1 29 . In 1983, Cavedon Chemical of U.S.A. recommended zircoaluminate system coupling agent represented by seven of zircoaluminate L.B. Cohen, Plastics Engineering, 1983.39 11 , 29 32 . Other organic compounds and organo metallic compounds containing other metallic atoms are also used as coupling agent, but their properties and importance can not be compared favorably with four coupling agent systems above mentioned. Furthermore, in recent years, chelate compounds of organic cluminium have been put forth for using as drier of coatings B.P.1462610 , surface treating agent of glassfibre of reinforced epoxy resin J.P.83.79023 , adhesive promoter of coating layer to glass C.A.99.214185g , fibreglass surface threating agent in copolymer of acryl ester methacrylic ester C.A.97.56624b and to improve the addhesive property of intergrated circuit to polyacetylimide instead of aminosilane coupling agent J. Electrochemical Soc.1982. 2278 2282 . Aluminates were not yet considered to be used as coupling agent till 1983 because they are unstable and easy to hydrolyze L.B. Cohen, plastic Engineering, 1983,11,29 . In a word, investigation production and application are still concentrated on silica and titanium, the most important systems in coupling agent. But up to now these two systems of coupling agent are made by using their corersponding anhydrous chlorides as starting materials Thus, the preparation of these coupling agent bring about more expensive production cost, more serious corrosion and more complicated process, resulting in high price products and limited applications. The object of the present invention is to provide a new coupling agent system, which is of easy to synthesize, low production cost and good quality. In the present invention, we selected aluminium, which is rich in resource and cheap in price, as the central atom of coupling agent, and took advantage of its active and amphotric characteristics to react directly with lower alcohols to form the intermediate of trialkoxyl aluminium which can be treated with the substances defined chain length, proper steric hindrance and acidic radicals such as hydroxyl, phenolic group, carboxyl, phosphyl, sulfonyl, etc. and other functional group, and esters thereof ethers as well as anhydrides. The final products aluminate or derivatives thereof prepared in such manner have proper stability against hydrolysis. At the same time, we use proper method of satisfying coordination number of aluminium 1 3 in order and to overcome or decrease the associativity of aluminate and derivatives thereof. The aluminate or derivative thereof thus obtained possess neccessary chemical and physical properties for coupling agent.
