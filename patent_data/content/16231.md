# METHOD OF MAKING THICK FILM FINE PATTERNS.

## Abstract
A method of making thick film fine patterns comprising the steps of applying paste for forming circuits on an insu lated substrate 1 , drying the paste, depositing photoresist material 3 on the surface of the paste film 2 , the paste being oily whereas the photoresist is aqueous or vice versa, thereby enabling to form circuit patterns by means of photo etching technique.
