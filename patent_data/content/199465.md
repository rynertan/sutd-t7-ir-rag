## Description
The present invention relates to cyano derivatives and in particular to cyanoalkanimidamido compounds. This invention further relates to processes for their preparation, intermediates in their preparation, their use as therapeutic agents and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The compounds of this invention are phosphodiesterase type III inhibitors and are of use in combatting such conditions wherein such inhibition is thought to be beneficial. The compounds of this invention are positive inotropic agents and vasodilators with an extended duration of action and are therefore of value in combatting cardiovascular disease, in particular congestive heart failure. In addition the compounds of this invention inhibit platelet aggregation and therefore have an antithrombotic effect. Furthermore the compounds of this invention are bronchodilators and are therefore of use in combatting chronic obstructive lung diseases such as asthma and bronchitis. The major utility of the compounds of this invention is in the treatment of congestive heart failure, for such treatment the compounds have a very desirable profile of activity. Congestive heart failure is traditionally treated with cardiac glycosides, for example digoxin and digitoxin, and sympathomimetic agents. The glycosides have pronounced toxic effects with a low therapeutic index. The sympathomimetic agents generally do not have the desired profile of activity and are not orally effective. Amrinone is a marketed compound of interest that is reported to be an inotropic agent. This has an undesirable profile of side effects when administered orally and development is being restricted to other modes of administration. clearly there is a continuing need for orally active inotropic agents that have a good therapeutic profile.
