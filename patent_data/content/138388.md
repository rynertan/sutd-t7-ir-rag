# APPARATUS FOR SAMPLING FLUID FLOW

## Abstract
Apparatus for sampling fluid flow in a plurality of pas sages 12 comprises a conduit 13 connected to the pas sages. A device 9 is movable along the conduit 13 to con nect a selected passage 12 to the conduit 13 and allow flow from the passage through the device 9 and conduit to test equipment which may be external to a vessel 10 con taining the passages. In one arrangement normally closed valves 14 are associated respectively with the passages 12 and the movable device 9 opens the valve of the se lected passage. In an alternative arrangement which ob viates the need for valves, a flexible pipe in the conduit may be used to pull the device, the flow being along the pipe.
