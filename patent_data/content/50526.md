# Fluidizable bed combustion chamber.

## Abstract
A fluidizable bed combustion chamber 1 comprises an intermediate partition 2 which divides the chamber 1 into an upper combustion space 1a and a lower plenum chamber 1b and which is provided with means 4a for injecting fuel into the upper combustion space 1a in which, during use of the combustion chamber, a bed 6 of fluidized material is created. The intermediate partition 2 is composed of a plurality of nested modules 7 , each of polygonal shape and having a substantially centrally positioned fuel supply member 8 . Each corner 9 of each module 7 is upwardly inclined in the direction away from the center of the module, and these corners 9 are provided with openings 10 enabling air to be injected into the upper combustion space 1a from the plenum chamber 1b . Pre ferably, the modules 7 are of regular polygonal shape, for example triangular, quadratic or hexagonal.
