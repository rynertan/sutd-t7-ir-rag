# LOGIC CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A logic circuit operable at a high speed and with a low power consumption is disclosed. The logic circuit comprises a plurality of logic stages in which the logic stage other than the final stage includes a pair of logic sections which perform logic operations complementary each other in a push pull manner thereby to generate a pair of true and complement signals.
