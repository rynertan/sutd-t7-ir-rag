# Method for the manufacture of photoconductive insulating elements with a broad dynamic exposure range.

## Abstract
An improved method for the manufacture of a photocon ductive insulating element comprising an electrically conductive support, a barrier layer overlying the support, and a layer of doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon overlying the barrier layer, wherein the doped layer is formed by a process of plasma induced dissociation of a gaseous mixture of a silane and a doping agent, and the dissociation is a temperature controlled process in which deposition of a final portion of the doped layer is carried out at a temperature which is less than the temperature used in forming the initial portion of the doped layer. Control of the temperature of the deposition process in this manner provides a substantial increase in the dynamic exposure range of the element.
