## Description
BIAS CIRCUIT WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF OUTPUT DEVICE VOLTAGE CHARACTERISTICS FOR BIASING AN AMPLIFIER IN CLASS AB OPERATION Background of the Invention The present invention relates to Class AB amplifier circuits and, more particularly, to bias circuitry for biasing the output push pull transistor stage into partial conduction wherein the quiescent current flowing therethrough is made independent of the output transistor s base to emitter voltage. There are many applications for monolithic integrated amplifiers to provide large currents to direct coupled loads. In order to reduce power consumption in order to prevent undesired heating of the die, the amplifier should be operated in a Class AB mode of operation. Class AB operation is desired over Class B operation because of the more faithful reproduction of the applied input signal at the output of the amplifier. In Class AB operation the amplifier will source and sink current with respect to the load coupled directly thereto. Distortion at the cross over point is a particular problem associated with Class AB operated amplifiers, i.e., cross over is that point where the amplifier switches from sinking current to sourcing current and vice versa.Typically, cross over distortion is severely limited by biasing the complementary transistor output stage of the amplifier into partial conduction by a small quiescent biasing current that is produced from a bias circuit which is matched to the output devices of the amplifier. It is important that the bias circuit be matched to the output transistor to maintain low cross over distortion. However, there may be different applications in which the characteristics of one or the other output transistor cannot be determined so that the bias circuitry cannot be matched thereto. For example, one such application arises with the use of Subscriber LoopInterface Circuits SLICs which provide balanced two wire to four wire telephone signal conversion. Most prior art SLICs comprise an integrated circuit having an output power stage which is realized by an external transistor to the SLIC that supplies drive current to the subscriber loop and which is operated in Class AB mode as is known. The external power device utilized in such SLICs may be a single NPN PNP power transistor or a Darlington amplifier. For instance, the MC3419 SLIC manufactured by Motorola, Inc. includes external transistors coupled between the SLIC and the subscriber loop which are operated in a Class AB mode. As the base to emitter voltage VBE of these external devices is either unknown or may vary from one device to another, there exists a need for producing a quiescent bias current on chip of the SLIC to bias the external devices partially on, which bias current is made independent of the device characteristics. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved Class AB amplifier circuit. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a Class AB amplifier circuit for providing an amplified signal across a load coupled to an output thereof in response to receiving an alternating input signal comprising output drive means including an output transistor connected to the output of the amplifier circuit for producing current through the load when rendered conductive, differential amplifier means for producing a predetermined offset voltage across first and second terminals thereof, current bias means coupled between said first and second terminals of said differential amplifier means to said output transistor for establishing a quiescent bias current therethrough independent to the direct current characteristics of said output transistor, and circuit means for interconnecting said output drive means, said differential amplifier means and said current bias means for causing said offset voltage developed across said current bias means to remain substantially constant independent to said direct current output transistor characteristics. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating aClass AB amplifier of one embodiment of the present invention FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating a Class AB amplifier of another embodiment of the present invention and FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating still another embodiment of the invention. Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments Referring to FIG. 1 there is shown Class AB biased amplifier 10 of one embodiment of the present invention.Amplifier 10 is adapted to receive an input signal at terminal 12 which is typically an alternating signal. In response to respective periodic halves of the alternating signal, amplifier 10 can either source or sink current at output terminal 14 amplifier 10 being operated in a ClassAB mode of operation to reduce or severely limit cross over distortion. Amplifier 10 is generally suited to be manufactured in integrated circuit form. However, as indicated by being drawn within the circle, output transistor 16 may be an external device forming a portion of the output driver section of amplifier 10. Transistor 16 may be a single discrete power device or may be realized in any other circuit form such as a Darlington connected power stage.By utilizing an external power device, load currents may be sourced to terminal 14 which may exceed the power capabilities of the integrated circuit comprising the remainder of the amplifier circuit. Transistor 16 is coupled in a push pull configuration with transistor 18 through resistor 20 between the two power supply conductors 22 and 24. The remainder of the output drive section includes transistor 26 which is connected in a Darlington configuration with transistor 16.It is noted that some components are not referenced as they provide only conventional biasing as is well understood. A constant current source 28 is coupled between power supply conductor 22 and the base of transistor 26 to the collector of transistor 30 and provides a constant current of magnitude I. The collector emitter path of transistor 30 is coupled in series with resistor 32 and constant current source 34. Constant current source 34 sinks a current of magnitude 21. The base of transistor 30 is coupled to node 36. A diode 38 is connected between the lower end of resistor 32 and node 40. As illustrated, Class AB amplifier 10 operates predominately in a current sourcing mode. However, current is both sourced and sinked at output 14. As is understood, in response to a positive alternating portion of the input signal transistor 16 is rendered more conductive to source current to the output. Conversely, during the negative alternating half cycle of the applied input signal, transistor 16 is rendered less and less conductive while transistor 18 is rendered more conductive to sink current from the output. In order to minimize the cross over distortion that arises due to Class AB operation, it is desirable to provide a small quiescent bias current to maintain transistors 16 and 18 into partial conduction. To ensure minimum cross over distortion it is important that the biasing circuit utilized to produce the quiescent bias current be matched to the output transistor. However, in the present invention, because transistor 16 is an external power device, its direct current characteristics, for example, the base to emitter voltage Vbe may not be known. Therefore, it is the intent of the present invention to provide means for biasing transistor 16 into partial conduction, using a stable circuit loop, that is independent of the transistor s Vbe. The biasing scheme operates in the following manner.Transistor 30 and diode 38 form a differential amplifier having a voltage offset that appears across first and second terminals at nodes 36 and 40. The small voltage offset is made constant and is substantially equal to the value of current I from current source 28 times the value of resistor 32 IR32 . A current of magnitude I is forced through diode 38 such that the current source 34 sinks the current 21. Hence, a current of 2I is forced through current biasing resistor 20 which is determined by the voltage offset appearing thereacross, the ratio of the resistors and the area ratio of transistor 30 and diode 38 as understood. Transistors 16, 26, 30 and diode 38 are connected to form a stable circuit loop to force the voltage offset across resistor 32 to be applied across resistor 20.Therefore, the quiescent current, 2I, flowing through current biasing resistor 20 is made independent of theVbe drop of transistor 16. Thus, external transistor 16 will be biased into class AB operation by a quiescent current of magnitude to I flowing therethrough. In turn, complementary transistor 18 is biased by a current of magnitude I. Turning now to FIG. 2 there is shown Class AB biased amplifier 50 which includes a PNP transistor 52 that may be external to the amplifier circuit. The biasing means for biasing transistor 52 into partial conduction is essentially the same as discussed above. An input signal to be amplified is applied to terminal 54 which causes current to be sourced from Darlington connected transistors 56 and 58 to the output terminal 60 during a positive alternating half cycle and causes transistor 52 to sink current during a negative half cycle portion. As indicated by external transistor 52 being a PNP device, amplifier 50 predominantly sources current from output 60. In a similar manner as described for amplifier 10, diode 62 and transistor 64 form a differential amplifier for producing a voltage offset across first and second terminals at node 66 and 68. The voltage offset which is of known magnitude is developed across resistor 70 and is substantially equal to the value of the difference between the magnitude of the current sourced through constant current source 72 and the current sourced from constant current source 74 through transistor 64 times the value of resistor 70. Transistor 52 is connected in a Darlington configuration with transistor 76. The base of transistor 76 is connected at node 78 to constant current source 80 and through a voltage level shift circuit comprising diodes 82, 84 and transistor 86 to the collector of transistor 64. A circuit loop is formed by transistors 56, 58, 64, 86 and diode 62, 82 and 84 and forces the voltage offset across current biasing resistor 88 to be equal to the voltage developed across resistor 70 resistor 88 being coupled between node 66 and 68. Hence, the quiescent biasing current flowing through resistor 88 is made independent of the Vbe of transistor 52. Referring to FIG. 3 there is shown a Class AB amplifier 100 including a NPN external transistor.Amplifier 10 functions in the same manner as described above with regards to amplifier 10 of FIG. 1 and is shown with components corresponding to like components thereof having the same reference numerals. A current mirror 102 replaces current source 28 and is utilized to force equal currents through transistors 30 and 104 to supply the current sourced by constant current source 34. Transistors 30 and 104 form the differential amplifier previously mentioned wherein a voltage offset is developed across diode 106. This offset voltage is developed across current biasing diode 110 to set the quiesent current flowing through transistor 16 independent of its Vbe characteristics. The voltage across diode 110 is forced to be equal to the offset voltage developed across diode 106 by the loop comprising transistors 26, 16, 30, 104 and current mirror 102. Thus, what has been described above, is a novel biasing scheme for biasing output amplifier stages in aClass AB mode of operation independent to the power output devices base to emitter voltage characteristics.
