# Electric hand plane.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an electric hand plane with a preferably belt driven cutter 16 provided with planing tools 17 about its outside surface. The cutter 16 is conical and arranged with the cutter spindle 9 at an angle to the working plane 2 , said angle being half of the cone angle 2a . At the end of the cutter 16 which has the larger diameter, the bearing 11, 13 of the cutter spindle 9 as well as the other parts of the hand plane are disposed on the same side as the cutter of a lateral plane 18 perpendicular to the working plane 2 and touching the short side of the planing tools 17 when they are in the working plane 2 . The hand plane can thus work right up to a wall or edge upright from the workpiece. The larger end of the cutter can be provided with lateral planing tools for planing such a wall or edge. The hand plane also has an adjustable side support in the form of an angularly adjustable plate for contact with a side wall.

## Description
Electric hand plane The present invention relates to an electric hand plane comprising a frame, a rotatably mounted cutter with at least one planing tool and with a driving member at one end of the cutter, and an electric motor carried by the frame and which, via a drive arrangement, drives the driving member and thereby the cutter, the hand plane having a main support surface which defines a main working plane tangent to the planing tool in its working position, the cutter being conical with the cutter spindle forming an angle with the working plane corresponding to half the angle of the cone. Plane of this type is known through West GermanUtility Model publication G 78 33 580. This publication shows a plane having a conical cutter supported at its smaller end. Rabbeting may be carried out with the larger cutter end. The disadvantage of supporting the cutter at one end onl is that the bearing arrangement necessarily becomes expensive and space consuming if the free end of the cutter is to be prevented from resiliently moving up when the plane is pressed against the workpiece during work. In spite of this, vibrations may arise and the width of the plane is substantial. If, in order to lessen these drawbacks, the conical cutter were provided in a conventional manner with bearings at both ends, the maximum depth of cut is decreased to less than half the diameter of the larger cutter end. The purpose of the present invention is to avoid the above disadvantages and provide a hand plane whose conical cutter is sturdily supported while still allowing unlimited depth of cut. According to the invention, this is achieved with a hand plane in which the cutter is supported in the frame at both its ends in such a way that at the larger cutter end all parts of the hand plane, i.e. the cutter as well as the bearing and those parts of the frame which support the cutter spindle at the larger cutter end, are located to one and the same side of ire lateral plane perpendicular to the main working plane and touching the larger cutter end at the point thereof lying closest to the main working plane. Since all parts of the electric plane are located to one side of the lateral plane, planing is possible right up to a lateral surface of any height. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, a lateral support is pivotally jointed to the plane frame about a pivot axis extending next to the main working plane at the larger end of the cutter and perpendicular to the cutter spindle, the angle of said lateral support relative to the lateral plane being adjustable with setting means for setting the angle between the main working plane and a secondary working plane formed by the lateral support. With this embodiment it will be possible to put the hand plane with its secondary working plane against a workpiece and to move the hand plane during work with the cutter spindle substantially perpendicular to the workpiece.The angle of the support surface, and thereby of the secondary working plane, with the main working plane can thus be selected to be greater or less than 90 . In order for the angle to be able to be selected less than 900, it is necessary that all of the parts of the hand plane frame be spaced from said lateral plane. The cone angle and the height of the hand plane can be kept relatively small if the driving member of the cutter is placed at the end of the cutter opposite to the lateral plane. Then the cone angle only needs to be large enough to create sufficient axial space at the cutter end of larger diameter for bearing, but not driving, the cutter.The cutter is preferably belt driven even if other drive means are conceivable, for example via chains or gears. According to a further development of the inventive idea, the larger cutter end is provided with lateral planing tools, which are preferably adjustably mounted on the cutter so that their cutting angle can be set at an angle to a plane normal to the cutter spindle. This permits easy planing of dove tail grooves, for example. One example of the invention will be described below in further detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which Figs. 1 and 2 show an electric motor driven hand plane as viewed from the side and from above, respectively, Figs. 3 and 4 show sections along the lines III III and IV IV respectively in Fig. 1, and Fig. 5 shows the cutter alone as seen from the rear from the left in Fig. 1 . The hand plane has a frame 1 the flat bottom surface 2 of which forms its main working plane. The rear portion of the hand plane as seen to the left in Figs. 1 and 2 has a handle 3 upright from the frame 1, with a switch 4. This switch operates an electric motor 5 fixed to the frame 1, and which has a belt pulley 6, not shown in more detail here, on the left hand side of the hand plane. Via a drive belt 7, the electric motor 5 drives a belt pulley 8 which is non rotatably mounted on one end of a spindle 9. The spindle 9 is mounted in the frame 1 with a ball bearing 10 next to the belt pulley 8. At its other end, the spindle 9 is mounted by means of a ball bearing 11 in a bracket 12 screwed securely to the frame 1 and which is made with a bearing seat 13 for the bearing 11.The seat 13 is sealed against dust by means of a cover 14 which is held in place by a lock ring 15 in the outer portion of the seat. The cover 14 also holds the outer ring of the bearing 11 in contact with the bottom of the seat 13. The spindle 9 carries a cutter 16 non rotatably joined thereto. The cutter 16 is conical with a cone angle 2a with its narrower end at the left hand bearing 10. The right hand end of the cutter 16 has a larger diameter and has a central axial recess 16a, which encloses the bearing seat 13 and part of the bracket 12. The parts of the bracket 12 located outside the end of the cutter 16 have small axial dimensions. The cutter 16 is provided with two diametrically disposed planing tools 17 removably mounted in the cone surface. The spindle 9 is arranged at an angle a to the bottom surface 2 of the frame. This angle a corresponds to half the cone angle 2a, so that the planing tools 17 in their bottom positions will make contact along their entire length with the working plane defined by the bottom surface 2. As a result of the incline of the spindle 9, the ends of the planing tools 17 at the wider end of the cutter will lie laterally outside the bearing 11 and the bearing seat 13 when in the lower position, i.e. in the working plane. The entire cutter and its bearings, as well as all the other parts of the hand plane, thus lie on the same side of a lateral plane 18 which is perpendicular both to the working plane 2 and to the orthogonal projection of the cutter spindle 9 onto the working plane, and which is tangent to the wider end of the cutter 16 at the working plane 2. The hand plane is provided with an adjustable lateral support in the form of a flat plate 19 which is pivotally hinged 20 to the frame 1, Fig. 4. The axis of the hinge 20 runs parallel to the working plane 2 and perpendicular to the cutter spindle 9. The axis is located as close to the intersection of the planes 2 and 18 as possible. The plate 19 is swingably jointed 21 at its top with one end of a threaded pin 22, the opposite end of which can be screwed into a threaded hole in an ear 23 projecting upright from the frame 1. By means of a wheel 24 non rotatably fixed to the pin, the pin 22 can be screwed in or out of the ear 23, thereby swinging the plate 19 about the hinge 20. Fig. 4 shows the plate 19 in the maximum swung in position, in which the support surface formed by the plate forms an acute angle with the main working plane 2. When the plate 19 forms a right angle with the main working plane 2, its supporting surface lies in the lateral plane 18. The plate 19 can also be set at an obtuse angle with the main working plane 2. As can be seen from Figs. 1 and 5, the cutter 16 is provided at its wider end with two lateral planing tools 25 arranged in cavities 26 in the end of the cutter. Each tool 25 has the shape of a circular sector of less than 900, the edge 27 being formed by a radial limitation and lying next to the end of the cutter. Next to the periphery section, the tool 25 has an arcuate slot 28 through which a lock screw 29 projects with a loose fit. At its point, the tool 25 has a slot which is essentially parallel with the edge 27, through which the head of an excentric screw 31 projetcs. The arcuate periphery of the tool 25 and the facing, arcuate wall 32 of the cavity 26 are provided with notches 33 and 34 respectively, which make it possible to set the tools 25 as according to the following. If the lock screw 29 is loosened, the tool 25 can be swung about its excentric screw head 31, so that the angle of the edge 27 to the cutter spindle 9 can be changed. The setting can be done with a screwdriver which is inserted into a suitable pair of notches 33 34 and turned. The outer tip of the tool 25 can be set with the aid of the excentric screw 31 so that it is in the end plane of the cutter 16 or at a desired distance therefrom, for example if the main tool 17 extends outside the end plane. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the inside of the bracket 12 is made with sufficient space next to the end of the cutter for the projecting tools 25 if they are set at an obtuse angle to the main working plane 2 the tools 17 . In front of the cutter 16, the plane frame 1 is provided with a chip discharge duct 35. For setting the cutting depth, the hand plane has a vertically adjustable support plate 36 in front of the cutter 16. The vertical position of the support plate 36 is adjustable with a knob 37 which is arranged on the top of the forward portion of the frame 1, serving at the same time as a forward handle. The planing is done by gripping the handles 3 and 37 and pressing in the switch 4, and moving the plane forward by hand with the flat underside of the support plate 36 in contact with the workpiece. The cutter 16 shaves off the outer layer of the work piece down to the level of the bottom surface 2. At the right side of the hand plane, planing can be done right up to a wall or the like standing upright from the workpiece. With the knob 24, the plate 19 can be set at the desired angle for contact with the wall.This feature also enables the hand plane to be used for rabbeting with unlimited depth of groove. Furthermore, it is possible to place the hand plane with the plate 19 resting against the surface to be planed if it has locally projecting portions, for example. The plane can then be slid with the plate 19 against the workpiece, and the righthand edges of the planing tools 17 will work the surface like a milling cutter. In this type of work, and in rabbeting, it is an advantage that the ends of the planing tools only be in contact with the work surface during a very short portion of their arcuate movement close to the bottom plane 2.This prevents scratches and roughing of the workpiece as a result of inadvertent contact between the planing tools and the workpiece at other portions of their path of movement With the lateral tools 25 in the end of the cutter, lateral walls can also be planed. Various forms of surfaces or grooves can be achieved by a suitable combination of angle and projection of the lateral tools 25, angle of the lateral support plate 19 and height of the support plate 36. Fig. 4 shows a setting with the edges of the lateral tools 25 parallel with the end of the cutter and the lateral support plate 19 at the smallest angle to the working plane 2. With this setting, the hand plane can be used to plane dove tail grooves.When the lateral support 19 is set at an angle of less than 900, as shown in Fig. 4, the lateral walls can be only so high that the lateral wall extends up to the side 38 lying outside the lateral support 19. This side 38 lies at a distance b inside the side plane 18 see also Fig. 3 . The planing tools 17 and 25 can be changed from below or from the side respectively, without removing the cutter 16 from the frame. If the cutter 16 should need to be removed, this is done simply by loosening the fastening screws for the bracket 12, and pulling the bracket 12 with the spindle 9 and the cutter 16 out of the frame 1, by virtue of the fact that the ball bearing 10 can be pulled out of its seat in the frame 1. The drive belt 7 must then first be removed from the belt pulley 8, which is of smaller diameter than the ball bearing 10 and thus can pass through the frame 1. Alternatively, the belt pulley 8 can first be removed. The axial position of the cutter 16 is defined in relation to the bracket 12 and thus in relation to the lateral plane 18. This is achieved by the cutter 16 being axially fixed on the spindle 9 which is in turn held axially fixed by the bearing 11 with the aid of an intermediate ring 39 and a lock ring 40 on opposite sides of the inner ring of the ball bearing 11. Said bearing 11 is in turn held fixed in the bracket 12 by the cover 14. For safety, the hand plane must also be equipped with hand protectors. For the sake of clarity, these have not been shown in the drawings. In the embodiment of the hand plane described above and shown in the drawings, the drive means of the cutter is placed at the thin end of the cutter. Alternatively, however, the cutter can be driven at its wider end. In this case, the cone angle should be larger to provide a sufficiently large lateral space for the belt pulley without having to increase the cutter diameter too much.
