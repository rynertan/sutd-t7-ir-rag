# Improved hydroponic growing system and method.

## Abstract
A hydroponic growing system 20 comprises an elon gated preferably rectangular hollow trough 22 having substantially closed sidewalls and bottom and an open top defining a central space. The trough defines a pair of spaced tracks extending the length thereof in the space and an elongated flexible strip 46 is slideably disposed in the tracks. The strip contains a plurality of spaced apertures extending vertically therethrough along the length thereof and in each aperture is disposed a plant growing cup 50 having a hollow body defining a central space, an open top, a porous bottom and substantially closed or perforated side walls The sidewalls bear outwardly extending peripheral supports so that the body of the cup extends down into the trough space and the cup is releasably held in position by the support bearing on the upper face of the strip. The trough may include an internal conduit with spaced openings 78 to supply hydroponic makeup fluid 68 to the trough space. The trough includes spaced hydroponic fluid exits 80 for removal of hydroponic fluid. The system is used by growing plants from seeds to seedlings in the cups, then inserting the cups through the strips into the trough and continuing hydroponic growing therein with periodic har vesting of the grown plants 72 at the downstream end of the trough together with periodic addition of seedling plans in cups to the upstream end of the trough.
