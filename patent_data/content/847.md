# Vinyl chloride monomer production.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for producing vinyl chloride monomer by pyrolysing a mixture of 1,2 dichloroethane and the isomer 1,1 dichloroethane. It has been found that mixtures containing between 0.1 and 10 by weight of the 1,1 isomer improves the yield of the monomer otherwise obtainable by using the 1,2 isomer alone.
