# Method of fabricating polycrystalline silicon wafer and fabrication tray used therefor.

## Abstract
A method of fabricating a polycrystalline silicon wafer 3 having the step of flowing in a predetermined atmosphere molten liquid of silicon base material on a rotating fabrication tray 1 toward a radial direction by means of a centrifugal force produced by the rotation of the tray, thereby forming a thin molten material layer of desired diameter with the molten liquid and solidifying the molten material including employing a cover 2 , at which a through hole 2c is perforated at the ceiling wall 2a thereof, detachably covered on the tray, a wafer molding space formed to be surrounded by the cover and the tray, the molten material being filled in the wafer molding space via the through hole to form a thin molten material layer. A fabrication tray is used to execute the method. Thus, the wafers can be si multaneously formed without production of small projections on the surface of the wafers.
