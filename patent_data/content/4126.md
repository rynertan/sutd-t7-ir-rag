# SOLAR ENERGY COLLECTORS

## Abstract
A solar heat collector panel is made up of an array of parallel extruded aluminium absorber elements 1 with internal longitudinal flow ducts 4 each element being extruded with integral lateral fins 5 of tapering thickness exposed on one face to solar radiation 12 and backed on the opposite face by thermally insulating material 9 . The internal flow ducts may be interconnected by manifolds at opposite ends and heat exchange by fluid flowing through each duct is enhanced by internal longitudinal ribs 6 in the duct. In a reversible version of the absorber element the entire element is rotatable about the longitudinal axis of the duct from a heat absorbing position in which a blackened face 16 is exposed to solar radiation through a transparent cover 17 to a re radiating position in which the face re radiates heat, for example into a horticultural enclosure. The cover is hinged and moves away from the exposed face as the element is rotated into its re radiating position.
