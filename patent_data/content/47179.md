# Radiation detector.

## Abstract
A radiation detector for collecting radiation reflected from an information bearing surface. In one embodiment. used in a flying spot scanning system, a generally cylindrical rod is placed adjacent the information bearing surface, the rod having photodetectors placed at the ends thereof. The rod is of glass with a longitudinally extending portion thereof fabricated as a variable period diffraction grating. This grating is located proximate to the scanned surface so that incident radiation reflected from the surface strikes the grating and is coupled into the rod via diffraction. The grating periods are selected in conjunction with the inci dence angles as to optimize the amount of radiation collected by the photodetectors.
