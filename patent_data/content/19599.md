# Goods conveyor track.

## Abstract
Goods 6 are placed on a supporting surface 4 connected with a conveyor member 7 forming part of the goods conveyor track 2 . The conveyor member 7 is made up of a number of units placed in a tubular shaped guide 2 . The unit is movable in the guide by means of a driving member 8 . The supporting surface 4 is connected with one of said units or is connected with a special member placed between two units. A displacement of the units 7 in the guide also brings about a displacement of the supporting surface 4 . The guide 2 acts as a handrail in a staircase 1 and the longitudinal slit 2c faces downwards. The supporting surface 4 is rotatably fixed to one end 3a of the holder 3 , the other end of which has a spherically shaped part. The supporting surface 4 can assume a vertical position and a horizontal position intended for the conveying of goods. The end 3a of the holder has also a sliding surface, usually a wheel, to cooperate with a sliding track 5 oriented along the staircase 1 .
