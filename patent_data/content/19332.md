# An apparatus for electrically stunning animals to be slaughtered.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an apparatus for electrically stunning animals to be slaughtered said apparatus comprising electrodes 9,10 which can swing about horizontal axis 11,12 and in the initial position extend downwardly into the V shaped passage way formed between two parallel endless conveyors said electrodes 9,10 with their axis 11,12 being mounted within a frame 8 movable by means of runners 7 between rails 5,6 in the direction of movement of the conveyors said frame 8 being connected to a drive mechanism 16,17,18 adapted to move the frame 8 with substantially the same speed as the speed of the conveyors and starting its movement upon closure of the circuit between the electrodes 9,10 by an animal to be stunned.
