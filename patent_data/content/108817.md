The present invention also relates to a process for preparation of the SX I composition. The composition of the present invention is suitable for pharmaceutical uses. It is known that SAM occurs widely in living organisms and acts as a methyl donor in many transmethylations in vivo.Pharmaceutical effects of SX1 have been reported in various disorders such as adipohepatica, hynerlipemia, arteriosclerosis, depression, arthritis deformans, pains in some neurological . manifestations, and sleeplessness. Since SAM, as it is, is too unstable for pharmaceutical uses, many salts and compositions of SAM have been proposed, for exampleSAM. p toluenesulfonate German patent first publication No. 2336401, Japanese patent publication No. 35726 1977 a double salt of SAM with p toluenesulfonic acid and sulfuric acid German patent first publication No.2430999, Japanese Patent publication No.3S727 1977 , SAM. methanesulfonate, SAM ethanesulfonate, SPP4 dodecanesulfonate, SAM.1 octadecanesulfonate, SPM 2 chloroethane sulfonate, SAM.2 bromoethanesulfonate, SAM.2 oxyethanesulfonate, SAM.3 oxypronanesulfonate, SAM d,1 10 camphorsulfonate, SAM.d,1 d,l 3 bromocamphorsulfonate, SAv cystenate, SAM benzenesulfonate, SAM.p chlorobenzenesulfonate, SAM.2 mesitylbenzensulfonate, SAM 4 biphenylsul fonate, SS0I 1 naphthalenesulfonate, S2 . 2 naphthalene sulfonate, SAM SAM.5 sulfosalicylate, SAM p acetylbenzenesulfonate, SAM.1,2 ethanedisulfonate, SAM o benzenedisulfonate, SAMchondroi tinsulfate, and a double salt of SAM with sulfuric acid and said sulfonic acids or chondroitinsulfate German patent first publication No.2530898, Japanese patent first puhlication No.125717 1976 SAM.1,5 naphthalenesulfonate and SAM l amino 8 naphthol 2, disulfonate, Japanese patent first publication No.38614 1978 SAM citrate, SAM tartrate, SAM.maleate, and SAM.ascorbate French patent No.2275220 a composition comprising SAM, sulfuric acid, and ribonucleotide 5 monosulfate Japanese patent first publication No. 109998 1979 a composition comprising SARI, sulfuric acid, and nucleotidesulfate Japanese patent first publication No. 154774 1979 a composition comprising SAM, sulfuric acid, and a sulfate of monosaccharide or oligosaccharide Japanese patent first publication No.105700 1980 a composition comprising SAM sulfuric acid, and cytidine 5 monosulfate Japanese patent first publication No.28808 1979 a composition comprising SAM, sulfuric acid, and uridine 2 31 ,5 disulfate Japanese patent first publication No.55598 1979 and a composition comprisingSAM or its salt and a lithium salt Japanese patent first publication No.125194 1977 . Known SAM preparations, however, are not sufficiently stable but are irritant and or toxic as pharmaceuticals. Moreover, many of known SAM preparations require complicated and costly puocedures for their preparation. Thus a sufficiently stable composition of SAM which can be prepared economically and is suitable for pharmaceutical uses has not been known therefore, such a preparation of SAM has been looked forward to. The present inventors have undertaken various investigations in search of a stable composition of SAM which can be prepared economically and is suitable for pharmaceutical uses and, as a result, have now completed the present invention. The composition of SAM of the present invention comprises a salt of SS8I and lactose and or maltose. The salt of S2h in the composition of the present invention is a salt of SAM with an inorganic or organic acid. It also includes a double salt of SAM with inorganic or organic acids.Examples of the salt of SAM are those with hydrobromic acid, hydrochloric acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, and p toluenesulfonic acid or double salts of SAM with the foregoing acids. The lactose and maltose in the composition of the present invention are preferably anhydrous. One of the processes for preparation of the composition of the present invention comprises dissolving the salt of SAM describes above and lactose and or maltose in an aqueous solvent to prepare an aqueous solution of said two components and then lyophilizing the aqueous solution. Another method for preparation of the compoition of the present invention comprises mixing a salt ofSAM with lactose and or maltose in powdery form. According to the present invention , a composition of SAM which is stable for a long period of time even at a room temperature and which can be prepared readily at low cost is provided for pharmaceutical uses. The composition of SAM of the present invention can be blendet with suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and additives to provide pharmaceutical preparations, in particular, stable oral preparations of SAM, such as tablets, pills, and capsules of SXt, and a stable inJection of SAM DETAILED DESCRIPTION The salt of SAM in the composition of the present invention can be obtained, for example, by the following known methods A. Preparation of SAM 1. SAM is produced in cells of microorganisms when the microorganisms are cultivated in a medium containing methionine F. Schlenk et al., J. Biol. Chem., 229, 1051 1957 F Schlenk et al., Enzymologia, 29, 283 1965 . The microorganisms include, for example, those belonging to the genus Saccharomyces, Candida, Hansenula, Pichia, Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula, Trichosporon, Kloeckera, Torulopsis,Hanseniaspora, Sporobolomyces, Lipomyces, Tolula, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Mucor, and Rhizopus. Cells of a microorganism separated from the culture broth are extracted with an acid such as perchloric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, formic acid, and acetic II acid, or an alkylformate to obtain an extract containing SAM The extract is applied to purification procedures herein after provided. 2. SAM is also synthesized enzymatically from adenosine triphosphate and methionine to obtain a solution containing SAM S. Hervey Mudd et al., J. Biol. Chem., 231, 481 1958 Japanese Patent publication No. 35727 19773. The solution containing SAM is applied to the following purification procedures.B. Purification of SAM Isolation of SAM from the solutions containing SARI described above and purification thereof are carried out as follows For example, any one of the following procedures or its proper combination can be employed. These procedures include, cation exchange chromatography fractional precipitation with Reinecke1s salt, picric acid, phosphotungstic acid,picrolonic acid, or methyl orange activated charcoal ado potion chromato graphy chelate resin chromatography and fractional precipitation with polar organic solvents.C. The composition of SAM of the present invention and the process for preparation thereof jl As described previouslv, the composition of SAM of the present invention comprises a salt of SAM and lactose and or maltose. Examples of the salt of SAM are described hereinbefore.Usually, however, various salts of SAM in which the molar ratio of the acid component to SAM is varied are obtained according to the kind of the methods for preparation or conditions therefore The salt of Spud4 in the composition of the present invention consists of S4 and preferably 0.5 4 moles, more preferably 2 3 moles, of the acid component based on 1 mole of the SAM component. In the composition, the molar ratio of lactose and or maltose to SA14 is preferably 10 or less, more preferably 0.5 5. The present inventors have found that some disaccharises which have glucose in the structure as their reduced terminal stabilize SAM against its chemical degradation. Examples of the disaccharide are cellobiose, gentiobiose, lactose, maltose, and melibiose. Of these disaccharides, lactose and maltose are more effective in stabilizing SAM than others. Either or both of lactose and maltose can be chosen for incorporation in the composition of the present invention to serve the purpose pf the composition in use. Lactose and maltose in the composition of the present invention are preferably anhydrous and the moisture content of the composition of the present invention must be 3 or less, preferably 1t or less. The composition of the present invention is stable especially in formulas prescribed above. For preparation of the composition of the present invention an aqueous solution containing said two components of the composition, that is, a salt of SAM and lactose and ormaltose, is prepared first. In this case, if the molar ratio of acid to SAM in the salt of SAM is less than the value prescribed above, the dificiency of acid is supplied by adding the acid to the aqueous solution of SAM on the other hand, if said molar ratio is more than the value prescribed above, the excess of the acid in the aqueous solution is removed by an OH type anion exchange resin such as Amberlite IR 45 a trademark of Rhom Haas Co., U.S.A. and Dowex l a trademark of The Dow Chemical Co., U.S.A. . The aqueous solution containing a salt of SAM and lactose and or maltose thus prepared is then lyophilized.Lyophilization is suitable to obtain the composition of the present invention without the degradation of SAM in the composition. As occasion demands, the composition thus obtained may be dried in vacuo over a desiccant such as phosphorus pentoxide and silica gel. In another method for preparing the composition of the present invention a salt of SAM and lactose and or maltose are mixed in powdery form. It is desirable that lactose and maltose in the composition of the present invention are anhydrous. Since commercially available lactose or maltose usually contains one mole water as bound water, its anhydrous type is, prepared by dissolving lactose or maltose in an aqueous solvent to prepare its aqueous solution followed by removing the aqueous solvent from the aqueous solution, for example, by lyophilization, drum drying, or spray drying. If, however. anhydride of lactose or maltose is commercially available, it is mixed with a salt of SAM in a powdery state to prepare the composition of the present, invention. The composition of SAM obtained above is dried until it contains 3 or less, preferably 1 or less, of moisture. The composition of SAN of the present invention is stable for a long period of time even at a room temperature,. The stability of the composition of SAM of the present invention shown in examples hereinafter provided was compared with that of four knon SSEr preparations, that is SAM.chloride the molar ratio of hydrochloric acid to SAM is 2 , SAM.sulfate the molar ratio of sulfuric acid to SAM is 2 , SAM.sulfate the molar ratio of sulfuric acid to SAN is 2.5 , and SAM.sulfate.g toluenensulfonate the molar ratios of sulfuric acid and p toluenesulfonic acid to SAM are 2 and 1, respectively the results are shown in Table 1.

As will be clear from Table 1, the composition of SAM of the present invention is stable when.stored even at 400C and 75 relative humidity for 6 months, whereas the four known SAM preparations are not stable enough when stored under these conditions. Thus, whereas the known SAM preparations must be stored at a cool place, the composition of SAM of the present invention can be stored at a room temperature. To further illustrate the present invention, but not by way of limitation, the following examples are given. EXAMPLE 1 A SAMsulfate consisting of 2 moles of sulfuric acid andI mole of SAM was prepared by a known precedure tF. Schlenk et al.,Enzymologia, 29, 283 1965 Japanese patent publication No. 13680 1971 . In 100 ml of distilled water were dissolved 10 g of the SAM.sulfate and 11.9 g of lactose, and to the resulting solution was added 2.8 ml of 6 N sulfuric acid. The resulting aqueous solution was lyophilized at 400C ar less for 36 hours to prepare 21 g of the composition of the present invention. The molar ratio of SAM sulfuric acid lactose of the composition was 1 2.5 2. EXNA2LE 2 The composition comprising SAM.sulfate and maltose 21 g was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 with the exception that maltose was used in place of lactose. EXAMPLE 3 A SAM chloride consisting of 1.8 moles of hydrochloric acid and 1 mole of SAM was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 with the exception that hydrochloric acid was used in place of sulfuric acid. In 100 ml of distilled water were dissolved 10 g of the SAM.chloride and 38.1 g of maltose, and to the resulting solution was added 0.78 ml of 6N hydrochloric acid. The resulting aqueous solution was lyophilized at 400C or less for 36 hours to prepare 46 g of the composition of the present invention. The molar ratio of SAM hydrochloric acid maltose of the composition was 1 2 5. EXAMPLE 4 In 100 ml of distilled water were dissolved 10 g of SAM. sulfate which had been prepared in the same manner as in Example 1, 3.1 g 6f p toluenesulfonic adid, and 17.5 g of lactose. In. the same manner as in Example 1, 30 g of the composition of the present invention was prepared. The molar ratio of SAM sulfuric acid p toluenesulfonic acid lactose was 1 2 1 3. EXAE3PLE 5 In 1 ,of distilled water was dissolved 100 g of maltose, and the resulting aqueous solution was lyophilized at 500C or less for 24 hours to prepare 95 g of anhydrous maltose. The anhydrous maltose 90 g that had been sieved through a 100 mesh screen was mixed with 90 g of SAN sulfate that had been prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 by a V type blender. The resulting mixed powder was dried at 30CC for 3 hours over phosphorus pentoxide under reduced pressure to afford 180 g of the composition of the present invention. The molar ratio of SAN sulfuric acid maltos of the composition was 1 0.86.
