# Solvent dewaxing waxy hydrocarbon oil distillates using a combination poly di alkyl fumarate vinyl acetate copolymer having pendent carbon side chain length of predominantly C 22 and polyalkyl meth acrylate polymer dewaxing aid.

## Abstract
This invention relates to processes for solvent dewaxing waxy hydrocarbon oil distillates employing a dewaxing aid which dewaxing aid is a mixture of a poly meth acrylate polymers and b polydialkylfumarate vinyl acetate copolym ers. The dewaxing aid mixture is selected from the group of mixtures consisting of a mixture of a poly meth acrylate polymer which is an ester of a C₁₀ to C₂₂ aliphatic alcohol with acrylic or methacrylic acid and has a number average molecular weight greater than about 5,000 and b polydial kylfumarate vinyl acetate copolymer wherein the pendent alkyl side chain group contains from 16 30 carbon atoms but is primarily i.e. 50 C₂₂ preferably behenyl , and the component B has a number average molecular weight of about 1,000 to 100,000, preferably about 5,000 to 50,000. The combination a plus b may be employed in a weight ratio within the range of from about 100 1 to 1 100, preferably about 8 1 to 1 4, more preferably about 8 1 to 1 1 most preferably about 3 1 a b, and at an aid dose level ranging from about 0.01 to 1 wt. , preferably between about 0.02 to 0.2 wt. active ingredient. The solvent dewaxing of bright stocks can also be benefitted by using as a dewaxing aid a combination consisting of component B recited above and a component A which is a polymethacrylate copolymer having an average pendent carbon side chain length of predominantly i.e. 50 C₁₆ and higher.
