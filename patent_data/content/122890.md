# Docking system for space modules.

## Abstract
A docking system for space modules includes a docking device having respective male and female coupling members 6, 7 carried by the two space modules 1, 2 . The coupling members 6, 7 are arranged to allow, after they have been brought into their coupled condition, relative rotation of the two modules 1, 2 about the axis X X of the docking device. The system further includes a plurality of connecting devices 8 arranged to lock the two space modules 1, 2 in a precise relative position after the male and female members 6, 7 of the docking device have been brought into their coupled con dition. Each of the said connecting devices 8 comprises a coupling seat 9 located in one of the two modules 1, 2 and a coupling shank 11 carried by the other module and axially movable between a withdrawn inoperative position and an extended coupling position. This coupling shank 11 has a head 12 which is expandible within the said coupling seat 9 to effect the connection between the two modules 1, 2 . The mutual approach of the two coupling members 6, 7 into a centered condition is achieved with the aid of an infra red indicator system.
