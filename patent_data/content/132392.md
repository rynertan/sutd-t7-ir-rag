## Description
This invention relates to a process for the asymmetric synthesis of α substituted α cyanomethyl alcohols and the use of such alcohols as intermediates in the preparation of chiral esters and chiral ethanolamines and in particular chiral pyrethroids and chiral arylethanolamines. It is known in the art that in pyrethroids of general formula for a given pyrethrin acid or pyrethroid acid moiety JCO and a given pyrethroid alcohol moiety R¹ CH CN O , there is a wide variation in pesticidal activity between the two pyrethroid isomers prepared from the two alcohol enantioners indicates a chiral centre . Therefore, there is considerable interest in the art in the development of methods for preparing the individual pyrethroid alcohol enantiomers and their use in the preparation of the more pesticidally active pyrethroid isomer. A preferred method for preparing the individual pyrethroid alcohol enantiomers would be a synthesis which gave an enantiomer in substantially pure form. However, hitherto there has been no publication of an asymmetric synthesis of individual pyrethroid alcohol enantiomers. All methods for the preparation of individual pyrethroid alcohol enantiomers which have been described hitherto have involved the resolution of the racemic mixture of alcohols or derivatives thereof. For example, in United Kingdom Patent Application No 2 013 670A there is disclosed a process for the preparation of the pyrethroid alcohol S α cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol. The preparation involves a resolution process in which the racemic alcohol is reacted with an optically active lactone to give a mixture of the two diastereomeric ethers of the alcohol enantiomers, the diastereomeric ethers are separated by chromatography over silica gel and the ether of the S alcohol is hydrolysed under acid conditions to give S α cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol which is purified by chromatography over silica gel. Clearly this is a long and costly process which, although suitable for small scale laboratory preparations, would prove difficult to adapt for large scale commercial manufacture. It is known in the art that the naturally occurring physiologically active arylethanolamine norepinephrine noradrenaline is in the laevorotatory optically active form which has the absolute configuration R at the chiral centre. Many synthetic arylethanolamines have been prepared which are physiologically active by virtue of binding at norepinephrine receptor sites but to date all of their syntheses have involved the preparation of the racemic arylethanolamines. In view of the difficulty in resolving the racemic mixtures of the sympathomimetic arylethanolamines, the commercially available pharmaceutical preparations containing these compounds have to date generally contained the racemic arylethanolamine. However, it has been found that S isomer or dextro rotatory optical isomer of these compounds may have some undesired effects. Therefore, clearly it would be advantageous to be able to synthesise the R isomer of these arylethanolamines to give products more like the naturally occurring norepinephrine and hence products having a more selective action, a greater therapeutic ratio and more cost effectiveness. In a recent paper Ohu, Ito and Inoue Makromol. Chem. It has now been found that α substituted α cyanomethyl alcohol enantiomers can be prepared in a highly stereospecific reaction by the asymmetric addition of hydrogen cyanide to aldehydes in the presence of a cyclic dipeptide catalyst without rapid separation of the product from the catalyst and that the product α substituted α cyanomethyl alcohols comprise either substantially one enantiomer or a high proportion typically 75 to 100 ie 50 to 100 enantiomeric excess of one enantiomer which may be used in the preparation of pyrethroid enantiomers and arylethanolamine enantiomers. It is to be understood that in the context of this specification the term enantiomer is used to refer to a product comprising substantially one enantiomer or a product comprising a high proportion, typically 75 or more and preferably more than 90 , of one enantiomer. Accordingly the invention provides a process for the preparation of an α substituted α cyanomethyl alcohol enantiomer of formula I which comprises reacting an aldehyde of formula II wherein Preferred values for R¹ include groups of formulae III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X and XI wherein When R¹ is a group of formula VIIb and one or more of R¹³, R¹⁴, R¹⁵, R¹⁶ and R¹⁷ are selected from acyl, suitable acyl groups include C₂ to C₆ alkanoyl, benzoyl and substituted benzoyl.

However, compounds of formula I containing such substituents may be readily prepared according to the process of the present invention by masking or protecting such interferring substituents utilizing masking or protecting groups of the type well known in the art. The process of the present invention may be effected on the compound of formula II having masking or protecting groups and the protecting groups removed from the product to afford the desired compound of formula I. Suitable masking or protecting groups It is to be understood that the process of the present invention includes within its scope the preparation of compounds of formula I having masked or protected substituents by reaction of corresponding compounds of formula II having masked or protected substituents and release of the desired compound of formula I if desired by removal of the masking or protecting group. Suitable cyclic dipeptide enantiomers which may be used as catalysts in the process of the present invention include diketopiperazines of the formula which may be prepared by coupling two α amino acids of formula XIII and XIV wherein R²⁸ and R²⁹ are hydrogen or by coupling two α amino acid derivatives of formula XIII and XIV wherein R²⁸ and R²⁹ are substituents other than hydrogen.

Preferred cyclic dipeptide enantiomers for use in the process of the present invention include R 3 benzyl R 6 4 imidazolylmethyl 2,5 piperazinedione C. R Phe R His and S 3 benzyl S 6 4 imidazolylmethyl 2,5 piperazinedione C. S Phe S His . Certain of the cyclic dipeptides which may be used as catalysts in the process of the present invention are novel compounds. For example, certain cyclic dipeptides in which R histidine is one of the amino acid residues and which have been found to be particularly suitable for the preparation of the S isomers of α substituted α cyanomethyl alcohols according to the process of the present invention are novel compounds. Accordingly in a further embodiment the invention provides a cyclic dipeptide enantiomer comprising R histidine or a derivative thereof as one of the amino acid residues. The cyclic dipeptide enantiomers of this embodiment of the present invention are diketopiperazines which may be depicted by the following formula XXXVI and which may be prepared by the coupling of the amino acid R histidine, or a derivative thereof, of formula XXXVII and an amino acid, or a derivative thereof, of formula XXXVIII Suitable R histidines of formula XXXVII include R histidine and the N alkyl, N alkenyl and N acyl derivatives thereof. That is, for example, compounds of formula XXXVII wherein R²⁸ and R⁵⁵ are independently selected from hydrogen, C₁ to C₆ alkyl, C₂ to C₆ alkenyl, C₂ to C₆ alkanoyl and benzoyl. Preferably the amino acid of formula XXXVII is R histidine. Suitable amino acids of formula XXXVIII include alanine, cysteine, histidine, homoserine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, norleucine, norvaline, ornithine, phenylalanine, serine, thyronine, tryptophan, tyrosine, valine and the N alkyl, N alkenyl and N acyl derivatives thereof. Preferably the amino acid of formula XXXVIII is one which has a large or bulky α substituent. Such amino acids include, for example, histidine, phenylalanine, thyronine, tyrosine, tryptophan and derivatives thereof. Phenylalanine is a preferred amino acid of formula XXXVIII. It is preferred that the amino acids comprising the cyclic dipeptide enantiomer of this embodiment of the present invention have the same stereochemistry. Therefore, the preferred cyclic dipeptide enantiomers comprise R histidine and another R amino acid. A more preferred cyclic dipeptide enantiomer comprises R histidine and R phenylalanine, that is, the compound of formula XXXVI in which R²⁷ is benzyl, R²⁸, R²⁹ and R⁵⁵ are each hydrogen and the asymmetric centre alpha to R²⁷ has the R configuration. The cyclic dipeptide enantiomers of formulae XII and XXXVI may be prepared by standard methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, the cyclic dipeptide enantiomers of the invention may be made by classical solution synthesis by the coupling of suitably protected R histidine with another suitably protected amino acid. The cyclic dipeptide enantiomer R 3 benzyl R 6 4 imidazolylmethyl 2,5 piperazinedione may be prepared, for example, by coupling N benzyloxycarbonyl R phenylalanine and R histidine methyl ester in the presence of dicyclhexylcarbodiimide and benzotriazole to give N benzyloxycarbonyl R phenylalanyl R histidine methyl ester, removal of the N benzyloxycarbonyl protecting group by hydrogenation and cyclization. The cyclic dipeptide enantiomers of formulae XII and XXXVI are, in general, crystalline solids and if they are crystallized from a solvent comprising water and or an alcohol they may be in the form of hydrates or alcoholates and or they may contain water or alcohol of crystallization. In the process of the present invention the reaction between the aldehyde of formula II and hydrogen cyanide, in the presence of a cyclic dipeptide enantiomer catalyst, is preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent. The nature of the solvent is not narrowly critical but preferably it is a solvent in which the aldehyde of formula II and hydrogen cyanide are soluble. The cyclic dipeptide enantiomer catalyst may be soluble in the solvent, homogeneous catalysis, insoluble in the solvent, heterogeneous catalysis, or adsorb the solvent swelling up to form a gel. Preferred solvents include inert hydrocarbons, halocarbons and halohydrocarbons which are solvents for the aldehyde of formula II and hydrogen cyanide and which are adsorbed by the catalyst to give a gel. Preferred solvents include the aromatic hydrocarbons such as, for example benzene, toluene and the xylenes. One of the distinct advantages of the process of the present invention is that the cyclic dipeptide enantiomers of formulae XII and XXXVI may be recovered from the reaction mixture and reused. The cyclic dipeptide enantiomers may be recovered by treating the reaction mixture, or the residue after removal of the solvent from the reaction mixture, with a solvent, for example diethyl ether, in which the reaction product is soluble but in which the cyclic dipeptide enantiomer catalyst is insoluble. The catalyst may then be recovered by filtration, recrystallised from water or an aqueous solvent, and dried. The amount of the cyclic dipeptide enantiomer used as a catalyst in the process of the present invention is not narrowly critical but preferably falls within the range of from 10 ¹ to 10 ⁶ moles per mole of the aldehyde of formula II. Surprisingly, it has been found that the degree of hydration in the cyclic dipeptide enantiomers of formulae XII and XXXVI is important to the effectiveness of the catalyst in the process of the present invention. Preferably the catalyst has a degree of hydration which enables it to swell in the solvent being used as reaction medium to form a gel. Catalysts which have too little or too much water of hydration apparently fail to swell in the reaction medium and do not efficiently catalyse the asymmetric addition of hydrogen cyanide to the aldehydes of formula II. In practice, it has been found preferable if the catalyst contains between 0.5 and 1.5 moles, and more preferably 1 mole, of water of hydration or crystallization per mole of cyclic dipeptide enantiomer. Also surprisingly, it has been found that the cyclic dipeptide enantiomers of formulae XII and XXXVI improve in stereospecificity of addition of hydrogen cyanide to aldehydes of formula II after their first use. Therefore preferably, the cyclic dipeptide enantiomers of formula XII and XXXVI have first been used, recovered, recrystallized and dried to the preferred hydration level before use in the process of the present invention to prepare α substituted α cyanomethyl alcohol enantiomers of formula I. In the process of the present invention the reaction between the aldehyde of formula II and hydrogen cyanide in the presence of a cyclic dipeptide enantiomer catalyst is carried out at a temperature below ambient temperature in order to obtain the desired stereospecificity of addition. Preferably the temperature is within the range from 20 to 10 C, more preferably at or below 0 C, and most preferably at or below 5 C. The reaction time required for the process of the present invention depends to a large extent on the specific aldehyde of formula II, the specific catalyst and the solvent used. However, in general a reaction time of between 1 and 100 hours is suitable and a reaction time of between 10 and 30 hours is preferred. In the process of the present invention it has been found that cyclic dipeptide enantiomers made from R amino acids catalyse the formation of S α substituted α cyanomethyl alcohol derivatives when the cyano group has a higher priority according to the Cahn Ingold Prelog Rules c.f. R S Cahn, C K Ingold and V Prelog Angew Chem Int Ed 1966 Certain of the compounds of formula I prepared according to the process of the present invention are novel compounds. Therefore, in yet a further embodiment the invention provides a compound of formula I wherein R¹ is a group of formula VIIb wherein R¹³, R¹⁴, R¹⁵, R¹⁶ and R¹⁷ are as hereinbefore defined with the proviso that at least one of R¹³, R¹⁴, R¹⁵, R¹⁶ and R¹⁷ is a substituent other than hydrogen. Certain of the compounds of formula I are useful intermediates for the preparation of a range of pyrethroid pesticides of formula XV wherein is a pyrethrin acid moiety or a pyrethroid acid moiety. Suitable J include groups of the formulae wherein wherein wherein U is selected from the group CH₂ , and p is an integer selected from 2 to 5 and Q is selected from C₁ to C₆ alkyl, C₂ to C₆ alkenyl, C₂ to C₆ alkynyl and the group wherein Examples of specific groups of formula J include those groups illustrated in Table 3 below Pyrethroids of formula XV may be prepared from the compounds of formula I by esterification. wherein J is as hereinbefore defined, or a derivative thereof. Preferably the α substituted α cyanomethyl alcohol enantiomer of formula I prepared as hereinbefore described is selected from the group consisting of the enantiomers of The esterification may involve the reaction of a pyrethrin acid, pyrethroid acid or derivative thereof, such as the corresponding acid halide, with an α substituted α cyanomethyl alcohol enantiomer, with retention of configuration of the pyrethroid alcohol enantiomer, for example as shown below Alternatively, the esterification may involve the reaction of a pyrethrin acid, pyrethroid acid or derivative thereof, such as the corresponding alkali metal salt, with an α substituted α cyanomethyl alcohol derivative, for example a tosyl, mesyl or benzenesulfonyl derivative, with inversion of configuration of the pyrethroid alcohol enantiomer, for example as shown below Specific examples of pyrethroids of formula XV which may be prepared from α substituted α cyanomethyl alcohols of formula I prepared according to the process of the present invention include those compounds illustrated in Table 4 below. Certain of the compounds of formula I are useful intermediates for the preparation of arylethanolamine enantiomers of formula XXXIX wherein Among the preferred arylethanolamine enantiomers of formula XXXIX are those prepared from the novel compounds of formula I in which R¹ is a group of formula VIIb wherein R¹³, R¹⁴, R¹⁵, R¹⁶ and R¹⁷ are as hereinbefore defined with the proviso that at least one of R¹³, R¹⁴, R¹⁵, R¹⁶ and R¹⁷ is a substituent other than hydrogen. Examples of suitable values for R⁵⁶ and R⁵⁷ include hydrogen C₁ to C₆ alkyl, and in particular, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and tertiary butyl and C₁ to C₆ substituted with phenyl and phenyl substituted with methyl, methoxy or hydroxy, with benzo 1,3 dioxanyl, or with octahydrodimethyldioxopurinyl, and in particular, 1 4 hydroxyphenyl prop 2 yl, 2 2 methoxyphenoxy ethyl, 1 benzo 1,3 dioxan 5 yl prop 2 yl, 1 benzo 1,3 dioxan 5 yl but 3 yl and 3 3 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9 octahydro 7,9 dimethyl 2,8 dioxopurinyl propyl or R⁵⁶ and R⁵⁷ together form a C₄ to C₆ alkylene linking group, and in particular, pentamethylene. Arylethanolamine enantiomers of formula XXXIX may be prepared from the compounds of formula I by reduction and, optionally, N alkylation. Accordingly in a still further embodiment the invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula XXXIX which process comprises the reduction of the nitrile group of an α substituted α cyanomethyl alcohol enantiomer of formula I and, optionally, N alkylation. In the above process, the nitrile or cyano group may be reduced directly to an amino group and the amino group directly alkylated or reacted with an aldehyde or a ketone to form an imine and the imine either reduced or alkylated as required to give a compound of formula XXXIX in which R⁵⁷ is hydrogen, as shown below wherein R⁵⁶L is an alkylating agent and R⁵⁸R⁵⁹C O is an alkyl aldehyde or a dialkyl ketone. The reduction of the nitrile group to an amino group shown in Step 1 reaction a above and the reduction of the imine group to an amino group shown in Step 2 ii reaction d above may be carried out using any of the procedures known in the art for the reduction of nitrile groups to amino groups and which will not racemize the chiral centre. Suitable reducing agents may be selected from sodium borohydrate optionally complexed with cobalt chloride, borane tetrahydrofuran complex, lithium aluminium hydride, borane dimethyl sulfide complex, sulfurated sodium borohydride, aluminium hydride in tetrahydrofuran, noble metal catalyst such as platinum or palladium optionally supported on carbon and Raney nickel. The alkylation of the amino group shown in Step 2 i reaction b may be carried out using any of the procedures known in the art for the N alkylation of amines and which will not racemize the chiral centre. Suitable alkylating agents may be selected from compounds of formula R⁵⁶L in which L is a leaving group such as, for example, chloro, bromo or iodo. The formation of the imine shown in Step 2 ii reaction c may be carried out using any of the procedures known in the art for the condensation of aldehydes or ketones with primary amines to form imines and which will not racemize the chiral centre. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that the imine formation shown in Step 2 ii reaction c and reduction shown in Step 2 ii reaction d may be combined in a one step reductive alkylation process. The alkylation of the imine shown in Step 2 iii reaction e may be carried out using any of the procedures known in the art for the alkylation of imines and which will not racemize the chiral centre. Suitable alkylating agents may be chosen from alkyl Grignard reagents, alkyl cuprates and metal alkyls such as lithium alkyls, sodium alkyls and potassium alkyls. In an alternative to reactions described above, the above process may be effected by reacting the nitrile or cyano group with an alcohol under Ritter reaction conditions known in the art to give an N alkyl amide. The N alkyl amide may then be reduced directly or converted to a thioamide and the thioamide to give a compound of formula XXXIX in which R⁵⁷ is hydrogen, as shown below.
