# FUEL CELL MATRIX FOR CARRYING AN ELECTROLYTE

## Abstract
A fuel cell matrix comprising a first layer of material having opposing first and second surfaces and second and third layers of material each adjacent one of said opposing surfaces, the first and second layers having different dimen sional expansion with electrolyte addition, whereby said layers tend to curl, and the third layer having dimensional expansion with electrolyte addition such as to counteract the curling of said first and second layers.
