# DESTRUCTION OF HALOGEN CONTAINING MATERIALS

## Abstract
An organic waste containing halogen is destroyed by treatment in a molten salt pool comprising a mixture of basic alkaline earth metal compound with an alkaline earth metal halide. An oxygen containing gas is introduced into the pool containing the waste to produce a gaseous combustion product and to cause the halogen present in the waste to react with the basic alkaline earth metal compound to produce additional alkaline earth metal halide.
