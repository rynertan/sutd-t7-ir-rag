# Fluid jet assisted electrographic marking apparatus.

## Abstract
A fluid jet assisted electrographic marking apparatus for ion projection printing wherein ions are generated in a chamber 32 , entrained in a rapidly moving fluid stream passing into, through and out of the chamber 32 , mod ulated in an electroded exit zone 36 by being selectively emitted or inhibited therein, and finally deposited in an imagewise pattern on a relatively movable charge receptor 48 .
