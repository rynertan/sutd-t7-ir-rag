# Ethylenically unsaturated polyesters.

## Abstract
Ethylenically unsaturated polyesters are provided. These ethylenically unsaturated polyesters are the reaction product of a a polyhydroxy polyester material that is the reaction product of at least one organic dicarboxylic acid, at least one diepoxide, and, optionally, monocarboxylic acid and or monoepoxide with b a polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated compound having a functional group reactive with the hydroxyl groups of the polyhydroxy polyester. This product is particularly useful as a protective coating material.
