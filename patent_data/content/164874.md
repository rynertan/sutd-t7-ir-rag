# Process for producing a heat resistant copolymer of alpha methylstyrene and acrylonitrile, and thermoplastic resin composition containing the same.

## Abstract
A heat resistant copolymer obtained by copolymerizing A 72 82 parts by weight of a methylstyrene and B 26 18 parts by weight of acrylonitrile, characterized in that the copolymer contains a 0 15 by weight of monomer chain A A A , b 50 by weight or more of monomer chain A A B , and c 50 by weight or less of monomer chain B A B , the total of a , b and c being 100 by weight. This copolymer has excellent heat stability and mouldability when moulded at high tempera tures, and the blending of this copolymer with other thermoplastic resins gives thermoplastic resins with excel lent heat resistance.
