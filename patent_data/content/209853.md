# Track jump servo system disc players.

## Abstract
A record disc producing apparatus, which can be used for searching a desired track location rapidly, includes a pick up device 11 for reading data from the disc and movable in a radial direction with respect to the disc and a driver 16 for driving the pick up device 11 radially with respect to the disc. The moving velocity of the pick up device 11 is detected and used to produce a velocity signal corresponding to the mov ing velocity. A kick signal is generated to energize the driver 16 . The kick signal is controlled so that the velocity signal approaches a predetermined value.
