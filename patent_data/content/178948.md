## Description
This invention relates to a bipolar transistor type random access memory RAM having a redundancy configuration and, more particularly, to a defective address memory portion thereof. In a RAM device, a large number of memory cells are arranged along rows and columns. The density of defects generated in such a semiconductor memory device during the manufacture thereof is relatively independent of the integration density of the device. Rather, it derives from the semiconductor manufacturing technology. In general, the higher the integration density of the device, the greater the ratio of normal memory cells to defective memory cells. This is one of the advantages of increasing the integration density of a semiconductor memory device. Even if a device includes only one defective memory cell, however, the device cannot be operated normally and, therefore, must be scrapped. As a result, despite the lower ratio of defective memory cells, greater integration density means reduced manufacturing yield. In a metal insulator semiconductor MIS RAM, in order to overcome the problem of defective memory cells, use is made of redundancy memory cells. When a defective memory cell is detected, a redundancy memory cell row or column is selected instead of the memory cell row or column including the defective memory cell. In general, one or two redundancy memory cell rows or columns are usually provided. In such a redundancy configuration, in order to store address information of such a defective row or column and to disable regular decoders for selecting normal memory cells so as to select the redundancy row or column in response to an address of the defective row or column, a defective address memory circuit is required. In the prior art, however, since there has been no preferably defective address memory circuit for a bipolar transistor type RAM, there has been no bipolar transistor type RAM having a redundancy configuration. EP A 0087610 describes a random access memory having a word group redundancy scheme using redundant and non redundant memory portions each with word group decoders a compare circuit and addressing means. It is an object of the invention to provide an information memory circuit suitable for a defective address memory circuit of the bipolar transistor type RAM having a redundancy configuration. According to the present invention there is provided a semiconductor memory device of a bipolar transistor type comprising a memory cell array a redundancy memory cell array means for receiving an address signal means for selecting a normal memory cell from said memory cell array in accordance with said address signal from said address receiving means and means for comparing the address of said address signal from said address receiving means with said defective address of a defective memory cell of said memory cell array so as to disable said normal memory cell selecting means and select said redundancy memory cell array when the address of said address signal is different from said defective address characterised by means for storing said defective address and comprising a plurality of 1 bit memory circuits of a diode type, each circuit corresponding to each bit of said defective address. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided an information memory circuit including at least three diode stages along a forward bias direction between a first power supply and a node a diode stage linked along a backward bias direction between a write power supply and the first power supply a shorted junction type programmable read only memory PROM cell linked between the write power supply and the node and a switching element linked between the node and a second power supply for receiving a one bit address signal, thereby generating a high or low potential from the node in accordance with the short circuited or non short circuited state of the PROM cell. In the above mentioned information memory circuit, two diode stages can be provided instead of the three or more diode stages, and in this case, the diode along the backward bias direction is changed by one resistor, or one diode stage along a forward bias direction is provided on the side of the first power supply. According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided an information memory circuit including at least three diode stages along a forward bias direction between a first power supply and a first node a resistor linked between the first node and a second power supply a diode stage linked between the first and second nodes and having the same conduction direction as the three or more diode stages a resistor linked between the second node and the second power supply a diode stage linked along a forward bias direction between the first power supply and a write power supply a short circuited junction type PROM cell linked between the write power supply and the second node and a switching element, linked between the second node and the second power supply for receiving a one bit address signal and an output circuit, connected to the first and second nodes, for detecting the difference in potential in accordance with the short circuited or non short circuited state of the PROM cell. In the above mentioned information memory circuit, in order to separate the circuits for determining the potential at each of the first and second nodes, three diode stages are added to the second node. Also, the diode between the first power supply and the write power supply can be replaced by a resistor, and one stage of the three diode stages can be omitted. Also, the diode stage between the first power supply and the write power supply can be detected. However, instead of this, a diode stage is provided on the first power supply. In the above mentioned configuration, if the short circuited junction type PROM cell is not destroyed, the potential at the first node is low. On the other hand, if the short circuited junction type PROM cell is destroyed, the potential at the first node is high. The data of the PROM cell can be read out by detecting the potential at the first node. Note that the difference in potential at the first node between the non destroyed state and the destroyed state of the PROM cell corresponds to the forward direction potential of one diode stage. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein In Fig. 1, which illustrates an embodiment of the present invention, a memory device comprises a 64K bit static memory cell array 1, and a redundancy array 2. Note that the redundancy array can comprise more than two rows or columns, but, in this case, a one row array is described in order to simplify the explanation. One row of the memory cell array 1 is selected by row address buffers 3, word decoders 4, and word drivers 5. That is, external row address signals A₀, A₁ ..., A₇ are received by emitter followers Q₁₁ and are converted by the row address buffers 3 into internal row address signals A₀, A₁, ..., and A₇, and their inverted signals The device further comprises a defective address memory circuit 6, an address comparing circuit 7 for comparing an input address defined by the external address signals A₀, A₁, ..., and A₇ with the defective address defined by signals A If all of the memory cells are normal, no problem occurs and, accordingly, the circuit of Fig. 1 operates in the same way as the conventional devices. However, if a defective cell is detected in the memory cell array 1 of Fig. 1, the row address of a row including this defective cell hereinafter referred to as a defective row address is written into the defective address memory circuit 6. The row address signals A₀, A₁, ..., and A₇ are always compared with the defective address signals A In Fig. 2, which is a detailed block circuit diagram of the defective address memory circuit 6 of Fig. 1, the circuit 6 comprises 1 bit memory circuits 6 0, 6 1, ..., and 6 7 corresponding to each of the row address signals A₀ , A₁ , ..., and A₇. That is, the row address signals A₀ , A₁ , ..., and A₇ are applied thereto, a high voltage such as 5 V is applied as a write voltage to the write terminal V Hereinafter, the 1 bit memory circuits will be explained in more detail. In Fig. 3, which illustrates a first example of the 1 bit memory circuit of Fig. 2, power supply V Provided between the power supply V Note that a transistor Q₁ is used for a write operation of the PROM cell PC. Next, the write operation of the circuit of Fig. 3 will be explained. In order to carry out a write operation, the write power supply V In Fig. 4, which illustrates a second example of the 1 bit memory circuit of Fig. 2, the diode stages D₀ and D₃ of Fig. 3 are deleted, and a resistor R₀ is provided between the power supplies V In Fig. 5, which illustrates a third example of the 1 bit memory circuit of Fig. 2, the resistor R₀ of Fig. 4 is deleted, and a diode D₀ is provided on the side of the power supply V In Figs. 3, 4, and 5, a resistor can be provided instead of the current source I In Fig. 6, which ilustrates a fourth example of the 1 bit memory circuit of Fig. 2, provided between the power supplies V In Fig. 7, which illustrates a fifth example of the 1 bit memory circuit of Fig. 2, in order to separate the circuit for determining the potential at node N₁ from the circuit for determining the potential at node N₂ during a non broken mode, three diode stages D₁ , D₂ , and D₃ are provided. However, the operation of the circuit of Fig. 7 is the same as that of Fig. 6. Thus, in the circuits of Figs. 6 and 7, the potential at node N₂ is increased or decreased by the potential corresponding to one diode stage as compared with the reference voltage at node N₁ , in accordance with the presence or absence of a write operation breakdown of the PROM cell PC. Also, the logic amplitude corresponding to one diode stage is read out by the following transistors Q₂ , Q₃ , and Q₄. In Fig. 8, which illustrates a sixth example of the 1 bit memory circuit of Fig. 2, the diode D₃ of Fig. 6 is deleted, and a resistor R₀ is provided between the power supplies V In Fig. 9, which illustrates a seventh example of the 1 bit memory circuit of Fig. 2, the resistor R₀ of Fig. 8 is deleted, and a diode D₀ is provided on the side of the power supply V In Fig. 10, which illustrates an eighth example of the 1 bit memory circuit of Fig. 2, in order to separate the circuit for determining the potential at node N₁ from the circuit for determining the potential at node N₂ , two diode stages D₁ and D₂ are added. However, the operation of circuit of Fig. 10 is the same as that of Fig. 8. Thus, in the circuits of Figs. 8, 9, and 10, the potential at node N₂ is increased or decreased by the potential corresponding to one diode stage as compared with the reference voltage at node N₁ , in accordance with the presence or absence of a write operation breakdown of the PROM cell PC. Also, the logic amplitude corresponding to one diode stage is read out by the following transistors Q₂ , Q₃ , and Q₄. The output A In Fig. 11, note that V Note that the number of diode stages D₁ , D₂ , and D₃ of Figs. 3 through 10 can be increased. However, in Fig. 7 or 10 , when the number of diode stages D₁ to D₃ or D₁ and D₂ is increased, the number of diode stages D₁ to D₃ or D₁ and D₂ must be also increased. In the 1 bit memory circuits as illustrated in Figs. 3 through 10, the logic amplitude is defined by the number of diode stages, and accordingly, such circuits are helpful in the configuration of the defective address memory circuit for storing a defective address in a bipolar transistor type RAM having a redundancy configuration. However, in the case of a write operation in the circuits of Figs. 3 through 10, a very large write current I In Figs. 12A and 12B, which illustrates another embodiment of the present invention, each of the row address signals A₀ , A₁ , ..., and A₇ are supplied via emitter followers Q₁₁ and Q₁₂ , diodes D₁₁ , D₁₂ , and D₁₃ , and resistors R₁₁ and R₁₂ to the defective address memory circuit 6. For example, if the high and low levels of an address signal are 0.8 V and 1.8 V, respectively, the address amplitude is 1.0 V 1.8 0.8 , and therefore, the high and low levels at the inputs of the row address buffers 3 are 1.6 V 0.8 0.8 and 2.6 1.8 0.8 , respectively, and the address amplitude is also 1.0 V. On the other hand, at each node N₄ on the input side of the defective address memory circuit 6, the high level 0.8 V of the address signals A₀ , A₁ , ..., and A₇ becomes Thus, during a non write mode, since the address amplitude input to the defective address memory circuit 6 is reduced as compared with the address amplitude input to the row address buffers 3, application of a large load of the write transistors Q₁ can be substantially avoided to the address buffers 3. That is, even when the gate capacity C During a write mode, since the voltage V Note that, in Fig. 12, two stages of emitter followers, three stages of diodes, and the like are used as the level shift down means. However, the number of such stages can be modified as occasion demands or in accordance with the power supply voltage. For example, all the five stages may consist of diodes. Also, if the write voltage is high, the number of such stages can be more than 6. Further, if the lowest power supply voltage is higher than 5 V, the number of such stages can be less than 4. Thus, in Figs. 12A and 12B, during a no write mode, since the address amplitude applied to the write transistors Q₁ can be reduced, the large load of these write transistors is not applied to the address signals, and as a result, the address access time can be reduced.
