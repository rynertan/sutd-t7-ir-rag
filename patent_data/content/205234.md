# Safety slide clamp.

## Abstract
A safety slide clamp to prevent free flow when tubing is disconnected from an I.V. administration device comprises a blade 12 formed with a tear drop 16 shaped aperture through which the tubing is positioned. The aperture includes an enlarged portion 18 and a narrow portion 20 which is tapered to form a slot that is engageable with the tubing to prevent flow therethrough. A base 24 formed with a well 26 is attached to the pump and is adapted to slidably receive the blade of the slide clamp. Retaining means 28 formed on the base are spaced to support the blade and retain the tubing in a recess between the fingers 30 and the base. Placement of the tubing into the recess and subsequent insertion of the blade into the well permits operational fluid flow through the tube. Subsequent retraction of the blade urges the tubing into the slot to prevent free flow from the tube upon its removal from the device.
