# Stave cooler.

## Abstract
A cast steel stave cooler comprising a carbon steel cooling pipe 1 having a roughened surface 2 and having a coating 3 thereon, and a cast steel 4 embedding the cooling pipe therein. The cast steel contains 10 to 25 Cr and has a very reduced liquid solid zone so as to prevent fusion of the cooling pipe during the casting. The cooling pipe may be provided with fins 6 which are integratedly welded to the cast steel.
