# Method and apparatus for wrapping cylindrical articles.

## Abstract
In wrapping cylindrical goods or articles the article 1 is rotated about its axis, a stretch film 14 being wrapped round the article 1 substantially in a plane containing the axis of the article. A web like wrapping material 24 is pressed against the cylindrical surface of the article 1 for rolling out on the article by rotation thereof. The stretch film 14 is wound over the material web 24 . The stretch film can be one with a smooth and a sticky side, and which is pulled out from a supply 4 . Winding the stretch film can be interrupted when the supply 4 is opposite one end surface of the article while the article rotation is continued a half turn, whereby the stretch film is laterally reversed in relation to the article. The film 14 can be initially wound with its smooth side in contact with the article 1 and later easily laterally reversed so that its smooth side is turned outwards to form the exterior of the article wrapping.
