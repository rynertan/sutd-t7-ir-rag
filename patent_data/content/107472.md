## Description
TUBULAR MEMBER The invention relates to a tubular member formed by a plurality of components, each of which components can be formed by casting or moulding. Components of relatively complicated shape can be formed by die casting metal or moulding plastics material, but if the mould includes sliding cores which project into the die or mould cavity and which must be slid outwardly prior to opening of the die or mould to enable the die or mould to be opened, the number of items which can be cast or moulded in each operation is severely limited. Thus, a die casting die including sliding cores may be able to cast only six items per operation whereas a simple split, two part die without side coring may be able to cast up to two hundred items in each operation. It is well known to manufacture expansion bolts comprising a sleeve formed by a plurality of die cast segments and to co operate with a bolt which extends through the sleeve and engages a tapered nut such that tightening of the bolt pulls the nut into the sleeve to expand one end of the sleeve by spreading the segments apart, the segments being retained in the form of a sleeve by a crimped ferrule at one end and frequently also a circular spring ring adjacent the other end. While such expansion bolts have been generally satisfactory in operation, the assembly of the segments to form the sleeve and the securing thereof by means of the ferrule and spring ring are relatively expensive manufacturing operations. According to the invention, a tubular member comprises at least two components of substantially similar form characterised in that each component comprises a first portion forming a part of a sleeve and, spaced axially from said first portion, a further portion integral with said first portion and forming a further part of the sleeve, with said first portion and said further portion offset with respect to one another around the longitudinal axis of the sleeve, that the components are so formed that by relative movementthereof, in a plane in which said longitudinal axis lies or in a plane substantially parallel thereto, the components can be juxtaposed ss eSher in interengaging relation so that the sleeve which they form is substantially complete, and that the components are securable against separation by a member engaged in the sleeve or by co operating profiles of the components. Each of the components is preferably so shaped that it can be cast or moulded in a simple two part die or mould, that is to say a die or mould which does not include sliding cores. Preferably, the sleeve is formed by only two components and said first portion and said further portion of each component are off set about said longitudinal axis by substantially 1800. Thus, each of said first portion and said further portion may be substantially trough shaped, that is to say semi annular in form, and be joined together at their adjacent ends so as to be integral by a relatively narrow web of material. Securing of the components by providing co operating profiles thereon may, for example, be effected by providing reverse tapers on abutting joint faces so that the components snap into the assembled position when moved relatively to one another in said plane. Such components can, if desired, be completely identical. When the components are to form tubular members which are to be the sleeves of expansion bolts, the components may be modified to suit their particular purpose. Thus, the junction between said first portion and said further portion of each component may be closer to one end of the component than to the other end circumferentially extending joint faces between the pair of components may extend at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the sleeve the faces of the components which form the bore of the sleeve may be configured, particularly to co operate with angled faces of a nut grooves, ribs or other variations in section may be incorporated to vary and control the particular locations at which bending or other distortion will occur when the components are stressed in use and to affect the grip which the sleeve will effect on the wall of a bore in which it is located in use and e ge portions of the components, adjacent that end of the at which the nut is to be provided, may be cutaway so as to pravidr recesses to receive projections from the nut to prevent the nut from rot itirq with respect to the sleeve. A pair of components can be formed secured together by intf rnl temporary fixing webs and incorporst inil the part of a nit and or a jolt such that all the components of the expansion bolt are moulded integrally, the temporary fixing webs securing the components together and to the parts of the nut and or the bolt being broken and the components thereafter assembled in their operative positions either by the manufacturer or by the user. The junction between the first portion and the further portion of each component may be abrupt and not extend for any significant axial length of the sleeve or may be gradual such that there is an intermediate portion which does extend for a significant part of the axial length of the sleeve. The application of tubular members according to the invention is by no means limited to expansion bolts. There may be many other applications which it is desired to form a tubular member, or even a solid member, out of simply moulded or cast components which can be engaged together by relative lateral movement and then secured against separating movement by inserting a member in the bore of the sleeve, by profiling the abutting joint faces or by other means. The invention is diagrammatically illustrated by way of example in the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is an exploded view of an expansion bolt incorporating a tubular member according to the invention Figures 2, 3 and 4 are respectively a perspective view, a sectional view and an exploded perspective view of a second embodiment of a tubular member according to the invention formed as a sleeve for an expansion bolt Figure 5 is a perspective view of a tubular member according to a third embodiment of the invention formed as a sleeve for an expansion bolt and incorporating a nut in two parts Figures 6 and 7 are diagrammatic views showing formation of an expansion bolt from the article of Figure 5 Figures 8 and 9 are respectively an elevation and an end view of the expansion bolt of Figures 5 to 7 and Figure 10 is a perspective view of a tubular member according to a fourth embodiment of the invention, similar to Figure 5 but incorporating a bolt. Referring to the drawings and firstly to Figure 1, an expansion bolt comprises a sleeve 1, a nut 2 and a bolt 3. The sleeve 1 is formed by two identical components 4 and 5. Each component 4, 5 comprises a first portion 4a, 5a and a second portion 4b, 5b. Each portion 4a, 5a, 4b, 5b is formed as a semi annular shell and the portion 4a is integral with the portion 4b and the portion 5a with the portion Sb by means of a narrow connecting web, only one of which, 5c, can be seen in Figure 1.Each component 4, 5 can be moulded or cast in a simple opening and closing mould since there are no re entrant portions and the components 4, 5 can be engaged together by sliding them relatively laterally in a plane in which lies the longitudinal axis of the sleeve 1 and in which lie longitudinally extending edges of one of the components 4, 5 which will, in the assembled condition, abut longitudinal edges of the other component.Due to the width of the connecting webs between the portions of the components, that is to say the web 5c, the plane in which longitudinally extending abutting edges of the portions 4b, 5b lie will be off set about the axis of the sleeve from the plane in which the abutting longitudinal edges of the portions 4a, 5a lie but by allowing small clearances, the two components 4, 5 can readily be moved into engagement with one another to achieve the assembled condition. Recesses 4d, 5d can be provided in the abutting longitudinal edges of the portions 4b, 5b to form an aperture 6 on each side of the sleeve 1, in which aperture 6 a respective lug 7 on the nut 2 can be received to prevent the nut 2 from falling out of the end of the sleeve 1. The bolt 3 passes through the sleeve 1 and once it has been engaged therein or once the nut 2 has been engaged in the bore of the sleeve 1, the components 4, 5 will be prevented from moving apart from the assembled condition.By screwing the bolt 3 into the nut 2, the free ends of the portions 4b, 5b can be spread apart by the action of a conical face 8 of the nut 2 whereby the end of the sleeve 1, which is innermost in a bore, for example in a concrete wall into which the expansion bolt is inserted, will be spread apart to grip the wall of the bore and prevent the sleeve 1 moving out of the bore. Preferably, the components 4 and 5 are identical with one another.Their shape can permit relatively easy mechanical conveyance in a defined orientation, for example supported on an upstanding thin wall member which engages the inner end face of the portion 4a, 5a and is vibrated so that the components can be transferred in a defined orientation to an assembly means for mechanically effecting interengagement of the components and insertion of the nut 2 and, if desired, the bolt 3 also. Thus, an expansion bolt, as shown in Figure 1, can have its sleeve 1 formed of components which can be cast or moulded in relatively simple moulds with subsequent transfer to assembly means and assembly there, all without requiring any manual handling of the components. In the embodiment shown in Figures 2 to 4, the reference numerals allocated to parts correspond to those in Figure 1 but increased by 10. Thus, a sleeve 11 is formed by components 14 and 15 made up of portions 14a and 14b and 15a and 15b. The widths of the webs 14c, 15c joining the portions 14a, 14b and 15a, 15b respectively are extended partly due to an angled face 19, the longitudinal edges of the portions 14a, 15a are parallel but off set so that relative movement of the components 14, 15 in the plane of the joint lines between the portions 14b, 15b is possible. The bore formed by the outer ends of the portions 14b, 15b is configured, as shown at 20 in Figure 3, to enable a part of the nut 12 to be received therein before a spreading effect is caused by the nut 12 acting on the portions 14b, 15b.Only one recess 14d, 15d is provided in each of the portions 14b, 15b to form a recess 16 for lugs not shown of the nut 12. Referring to Figures 5 to 9, a sleeve 31 is to be formed by components 34, 35 which substantially correspond in shape to the components 14, 15 of Figures 2 to 4. However, the components 34, 35 are cast or moulded integral with one another with temporary connecting webs 40 joining them together. Also cast or moulded integral with the composite component 34, 35 are a pair of half nuts 32a, 32b joined to the components 34, 35 by temporary webs 32c and to one another by a temporary web 32d whereby the components of a sleeve for an expansion bolt together with a nut thereof can be moulded as an integral unit.The arrows in Figures 6 and 7 show the relative movements of the components of the sleeve 31 and nut 32 necessary to move the components from the condition of Figures 6 and 7 in which they are cast or moulded to the condition of Figures 8 and 9 in which they are assembled, ready for use. The temporary webs 32c 32d and 40 can be removed by snapping them off if the sleeve 31 is formed of relatively brittle die casting metal or pared off with a knife if the sleeve is formed of a thermoplastics material by moulding. Referring to Figure 10, a sleeve 41 is shown which, in many respects, is similar to the sleeve 31 of Figure 5 but further includes a bolt 43 moulded integral with the sleeve 41 and the nut halves 42a and 42b and coupled to the portion 45a of the component 45 by temporary webs 43a. After movement of the components 44, 45 to the assembled position and movement of the nut 42, formed by the two halves 42a, 42b, into the bore of the sleeve 41, the bolt 43 can be driven in to break the temporary fixing webs 43a and then rotated to engage the thread of the bolt 43 in the thread of the nut 42. If desired, the expansion bolt of Figure 10 could be sold in the condition in which it is shown in Figure 10 with the movement to the assembled condition being effected by the user. While the tubular member of the invention has been illustrated by way of example as the sleeve of an expansion bolt, it is by no means limited thereto. It is envisaged that the tubular member of the invention could form the barrel portions of hinges or could be formed of transparent material so that it could, for example, form the shield of a thermometer engaged in the bore thereof whereby the thermometer could be viewed but would be protected. Since the bore of the tubular member can be configured without difficulty, the tubular member, formed by the two components, could be used as a receptacle into which a pin could be pushed, the bore of the tubular member, for example, being serrated so that the pin could be pushed into the bore but could not subsequently be pulled out. The tubular member can have, in relation to its outside diameter and its length, considerably thicker walls than a correspondingly sized tubular member formed by rolling sheet material. While the tubular member of the invention has been shown with two portions for each component, it is clear that a greater number than two portions for each component could be provided if desired.
