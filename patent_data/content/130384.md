# A two phase voltage signal generating circuit.

## Abstract
A two phase voltage signal generating circuit for generating a pair of trapezoidal wave signals of phases opposite to each other is disclosed which includes an input terminal S1 supplied with an input pulse signal, a capacitor 32 , a pair of voltage limiting circuits 39 connected to both ends of the capacitor 32 respectively and for limiting the voltage at each end of the capacitor 32 within a predeter mined voltage range, a current control circuit 33 controlled by the input pulse signal and for supplying a charge or discharge current to the capacitor 32 to generate the pair of trapezoidal wave voltage signals V₁, V₂ at the both ends of the capacitor 32 , a detecting circuit R1, R2, 57, 58 for detecting the change of the intermediate voltage of the trapezoidal wave voltage signals V₁, V₂ and a symmetry control circuit 45, 52 controlled by an output P₁₁ of the detecting circuit R1, R2, 57, 58 and for controlling the charge or discharge current such that the pair of trapezoidal wave voltage signals becomes substantially symmetrical to each other.
