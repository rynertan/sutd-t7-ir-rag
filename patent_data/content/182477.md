# FILTER APPARATUS FOR USE WITH AN X RAY SOURCE

## Abstract
Filter apparatus for use in x ray equipment including a repetitively pulsed x ray source, a window for transmitting x rays generated by the source to an object to be irradiated, and a vacuum chamber containing the x ray source and the filter apparatus. The filter apparatus includes a baffle for diffusing hot gases and directing them away from the window. The filter apparatus further includes an ultraviolet light absorber which overlies the window with respect to the x ray source whereby undesirable components generated with the x rays by the x ray source are substantially eliminated prior to reaching the window. Also disclosed is a method of eliminating undesirable by products of x ray generation.
