# Improvements in or relating to forming a rod of smokable material.

## Abstract
In a machine for making cigarette rods containing two types of tobacco there is provided a dual hopper 1200 for containing the two types of tobacco separately and a conveyor 1206 to transport the tobaccos side by side to a chute 1203 and thence to a carding area 1214 . The levels of the tobaccos in the carding area are monitored and if one is too high then an appropriate flap 306, 308 in the chute is opened and that type of tobacco is diverted and recycled to the hopper 1200 until the level of that tobacco in the carding area has returned to an acceptable level, whereupon said flap is closed and that type of tobacco is able to re enter the carding area.
