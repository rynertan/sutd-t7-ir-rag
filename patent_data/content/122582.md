# Yarn feeding apparatus and method for controlling it.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a yarn feeding apparatus for the selective positive feeding of several yarns to a knitting machine, comprising sensor means 27 30 for generating sensor signals, the sensor signals representing the respective feeding condition or non feeding condition of the yarns, and an error detection unit 31, 44 45 connected to the sensor means 27 30 for turning offthe knitting machine in response to predetermined sensor signal combinations representing a yarn breakage and or a yarn over feed and or a yarn change fault. It has been proposed in a prior, non published applica tion of the applicant to turn off the knitting machine if the duration of such a sensor signal combination exceeded a predetermined period of time. For shortening the response time of the error detection unit 31, 44 45 and for enhancing the reliability thereof, the present invention teaches that the error detection unit com prises a working position sensing unit 38, 39, 47 for generat ing position data representing the working position of the knitting machine, a logic circuit 31 for deriving a yarn chang ing signal from the sensor signals, a memory means for stor ing yarn changing position data, wherein the error detection unit determines whether the actual position data falls within a data range defined by the stored position data, and wherein the error detection unit disenables the turning off of the knit ting machine if the actual position data falls within the data range.
