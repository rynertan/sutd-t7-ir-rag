## Description
This invention relates to a new type of gastric antacid which exhibits a rapid and long lasting buffering action of controlling the pH of gastric juice to an ideal pH range without any likelihood of causing undesirable side effects such as osteomalacia, or phosphoric deficient syndrome including hypophosphoremia, hypophosphaturia, hypercalcinuria, anepithymia, ete. More spcifically, this invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an amount, effective as an antacid, of a phosphate ion containing hydrotalcite of the following formulaEMI1.1 wherein A1n1 represents at least one anion having a valence of nl selected from the group consisiting of H2PO4, HPOê4 and PO 4, A2 represents at least one anion having a valence of n2 other than the A1n1, and x, z1, z2, and m are positive numbers satisfying the following expressions x 40, z Z1 2, o z2 2, o m 40, o z1 z2 2, and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. The present invention also pertains to a method for controlling the pH of gastric juice which comprises orally administering the phosphate ion containing hydrotalcite of formula 1 , and to the phosphate ioncontaining hydrotalcite of formula 1 for use in treating gastic juice. Gastric antacids are used in the treatment of gastric juice including prevention and treatment of gastricisms such as gastritis, gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer by neutrallizing and buffering the pH of gastric juice. The present invention relates to an antacid which is useful in such applications and has an excellent activity. Antacids are required to rapidly neutralize and buffer the pH of gastric juice to a pli value at which pepsin is inactivated with a long lasting effect, and should also desirably be stable compounds whose properties do not change over a long period of time and which have a low content of sodium that may cause hypertension. Aluminum containing compounds have been used heretofore as antacids. Most typical of these are aluminum hydroxide gel and hydrotalcite Ng6Al2 OH 16C03.4H20 . The former is oldest, and is still used most frequently throughout the world. The latter attracted attention as a better antacid than the former, and its use has recently increased. The increasing acceptance of the latter is due to the fact that it has better stability and has a better action of neutralizing and buffering gastric acid. Aluminum hydroxide gel is an unstable amorphous compound. Immediately after production, its antacid activity is excellent.But since it gradually crystallizes to aluminum hydroxide, its original antacid activity is lost with time. The former also has the defect that because it can control the R of gastric acid only to a range of about 3 to 4, its activity to inhibit the action of pepsin in gastric juice is not sufficient. In contrast, because hydrotalcite is a stable crystalline compound which is stable to heat, light, water, etc., it has the advantage that even after the lapse of a long period of time from preparation, its antacid activity is not reduced. Furthermore, hydrotalcite can control the pH of gastric acid to an ideal range of about 4 to 6, and therefore, its activity of inactivating pepsin in gastric juice is sufficient, thus bringing about the advantage that the undesirable activity of pepsin on the stomachal wall tissue can be fully inhibited. It has recently been found however that longterm continued administration of an aluminum containing antacid causes side effects resulting in osteomalacia and phosphoric deficient syndrome including hypophosphoremia, hypophosphaturia, hypercalcinuria, anepithymia, etc.These side effects occur presumably because an aluminum ion derived from the aluminum containing antacid and dissolved in gastric juice captures a phosphate ion to be absorbed as calcium phosphate as a main ingredient of the skeleton to form insoluble aluminum phosphate which inhibits absorption of the phosphate ion into the body. The present inventors made investigations in order to develop a new type of antacid which is free from the aforesaid disadvantages and troubles of the conventional aluminum containing antacids. These investigations have led to the discovery that hydrotalcite like compounds containing two kinds of anions A1nl and A2n2 to be sometimes referred to in the present application as phosphate ion containing hydrotalcites conveniently free from the undesirable side effects of causing the aforesaid phosphoric deficient syndrome and osteomalacia, and have a rapid and long lasting activity of neutralizing and buffering the pH of gastric juice to an ideal range of about 4 to about 6 and therefore that they are very useful for prevention, and treatment of a broad ranges of gastricisms such as gastritis, gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer while inhibiting the undesirable action of pepsin on the stomachal wall tissue. The phosphate ion containing hydrotalcites of formula 1 is accordance with this invention have the advantage that they are very stable to light, heat, water, etc. and for example, have stability to heat of up to about 3000C and on long term storage, do not decrease in antacid activity owing to aging. Furthermore, these hydrotalcites do not at all cause a side effect of constipation which is seen in administration of aluminum hydroxide gel nor a lapactic action which is seen in administration of magnesium hydroxide or magnesium oxide presumably because these actions conveniently negate each other in these hydrotalcites.Moreover, since the sodium content of these phosphate ion containing hydrotalcites is only a trace which can substantially be neglected, they are not likely to cause a side effect owing to sodium even when administered to persons with hypertension, cardiovascular troubles, renal troubles, etc. It is an object of this invention therefore to provide a new type of antacid having the above advantages. The above and other objects of the invention are apparent from the following description. The phosphate ion containing hydroaltalcites in accordance with this invention are represented by the following formulaEMI4.1 wherein A1 1 represents at least one anion having a valence of n1 selected from the group consisting of H2Po4, HPOê 4 and PO , A2n2 represents at least one anion having a valence of n2 other than the anion AinI, and x, z1, z2 and m are positive numbers which satisfy the following expressions 2 x z 40, O z1 2, z 2 0 m 40, 0 z1 z2 2. Examples of the anion A2n2 are inorganic cid ions other thn A1n1, preferably carbonate ions, C2 C10 organic carboxylic acid or amino acid ions. Examples of preferred anions A2 are co2 tartrate ion CHOHCOO ê 3, salicylate ion C6H5 OH COO , citrate ion C3H4OH COO 3, glycine ion NH2CH2COO , glutamate ion C H N02 cystine ion C3H6N02S , lactate ion CH3CHOHCOO , and malate ion CHOHCH2 COO ê2 Hydrotalcite like compounds having these two kinds of anions and a process for production thereof are known, and are described, for example in Japanese PatentPublication No.32198 1972 U. S. Patent No. 3,875,525,British Patent NoO 1,336,865 , Japanese Patent PublicationsNos. 29477 1973 and 29478 1973, Miyata, Clays and ClayMinerals, Vol. 23, pages 369 375 1975 , and Miyata, Clays and Clay Minerals, Vol. 25, pages 14 18 1977 . Briefly stated, the phosphate ion containing hydrotalcite of formula 1 can be produced, for example, by reacting an aluminum compound, preferably a watersoluble aluminum or magnesium compound, with phosphoric acid or its alkali metal or ammonium salt in a liquid medium, preferably in an aqueous medium, under such conditions that the pH of the reaction system is at least about 8. If required, after the reaction, the product may be subjected to various steps such as solvent removal, washing with water, drying, pulverization, and classification. In another embodiment, a phosphate ion free hydrotalcite of the following formulaEMI5.1 wherein x, n3, z3, A3n3 and m are as defined with regard to formula 1 , 2 x 4O, O z3 2,0 m 40 is treated with an aqueous solution of an alkali metal or ammonium salt of a phosphate ion H2PO4, HPOê3, orPO 4 or with an aquenus slution of the A2 n2 ion shown in formula 1 and the aforesaid phosphate ion to exchange a part or the whole of 3n3 with the phosphate ion A2n2 may be the same as A3n3 . Examples of the aluminum compound used in the first mentioned embodiment include aluminum halides such as aluminum chloride, aluminum bromide, aluminum iodide and aluminum fluoride aluminum sulfate aluminum nitrate alkali metal aluminates such as sodium aluminate and potassium aluminate alcohol salts such as aluminum isopropoxide and aluminum ethylate and basic aluminum salts such as basic aluminum sulfate, basic aluminum chloride and basic aluminum carbonate. Examples of the magnesium compounds are magnesium halides such as magnesium fluoride, magnesium chloride, magnesium bromide and magnesium iodide magnesium sulfate magnesium nitrate magnesium perchlorate magnesium salts of organic acids such as magnesium oxalate, magnesium acetate, magnesium citrate and magnesium tartrate magnesium oxide and magnesium carbonate. Examples of phosphoric acid or its alkali metal or ammonium salts include orthophosphoric acid H3P04 monoalkali metal hydrogen phosphates such as monosodium hydrogen phosphate NaH2PO4 and monopotassium hydrogen phosphate dialkali metal hydrogen phosphates such as disodium hydrogen phosphate Na P 4, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate K2HPO4 trialkali metal phosphates such as trisodium phosphate Na3P04 and tripotassium phosphate E3P04 and mono , di and tri ammonium salts of phosphoric acid such as NH4H2P04, NH4 2HPO4, and NN4 3104. In the first mentioned embodiment, an alkali is used to adjust the pH of the system to at least 8.Examples of the alkali are alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, alkali metal carbonates such as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, calcium hydroxide ammonia gas, and aqueous ammonia. If x in formula 1 is smaller than 2, the antacid activity of the resulting hydrotalcite is insufficient, and if it exceeds 40, the pH buffered by the antacid exceeds about 6. Thus, x is suitably 2 x40, preferably about 3 x 10, more preferably 4 x 8. In formula 1 , each of A1n1 and A2n2 is not restricted to one kind, but may be a mixture of two or more kinds. As A1n 1, HPOê 4 is preferred. In order to have the hydrotalcite of formula 1 exhibit an anatacid effect advantageously, zl is preferably larger than z2. In other words, A1nl is preferably in a major proportion, and A2n2, in a minor proportion. The antacid of this invention may contain various known solid or liquid carriers or diluents and other additives acceptable for use in antacids, and can be formulated into desired dosage forms with or without various adjuvants known in the field of pharmaceuticals. Examples of dosage forms are dusts, granules, particles, tablets, coated tablets, suspensions, capsules and other orally administrable forms. The pharmaceutical composition in such a dosage form may contain about 5 to about q50 o by weight of the compound of formula 1 based on the total weight of the composition. If required, the antacid of the invention may further contain another antacid, a viatamin preparation, an anti inflammatory agent, a cardiac, an anti hypertensive agent, an analgesic, an antihistaminic agent, an antipyretic analgesic, a digestive, an antitussive, cold pills, etc. Or it may be used in combination with these agents or other drugs. The present invention also provides a method of controlling the pH of gastric juice, which comprises orally administering the phosphate ion containing hydrotalcite of formula 1 either as such or in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. The dose of the antacid of the invention can be properly selected depending upon the purpose of administration, the condition of the patient, etc., but may be within the effective range of conventional antacids.For example, the dose is about 10 to about 100 mg day kg of body weight as the active component 1 in oral administration. The antacid of the invention is a useful and uniqued antacid for prevention and treatment of gastritis, chlorhydria, gastric ulcer, and other similar gastric troubles, and exhibits a better action than conventional antacids without involving the side effects of the conventional antacids.
