# VEHICLE FOR TRANSPORTING AND POSITIONING A LOAD RELATIVE TO A DOCKING STRUCTURE

## Abstract
The vehicle 1 is intended for positioning a patient within a nuclear magnetic resonance machine 2. A base 59 on wheels 9 supports a carriage 7 which can be raised by a hydraulic cylinder. The patent lies on a cradle 8 which slides longitudinally on the carriage 7. A housing 5 on the machine 2 encloses a hydraulic motor which is coupled to drive a hydraulic pump on the vehicle 1 when the latter is wheeled into position. Portion 5a of the housing 5 is tapered to guide the vehicle into the correct position and incorporates a latching mechanism. The hydraulic system on the vehicle has interlocks to ensure that the carriage can be lowered and the vehicle un docked only when the cradle has been retracted onto the carriage. Also the cradle is locked unless the carriage is at the correct height.
