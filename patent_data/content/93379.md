# A two wheeled vehicle head parts assembly.

## Abstract
A head parts assembly for use in a two wheeled vehicle such as a bicycle and a motorbike includes a head pipe, a front fork pipe which extends through the head pipe and a pair of ball bearings to support the head pipe and the front fork pipe to be relatively rotatable from each other. The present head parts assembly also includes a self adjusting mechanism which allows to maintain the head pipe and the front fork pipe in alignment at all times.
