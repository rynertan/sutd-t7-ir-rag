## Description
This invention relates to a filter cloth assembly for use on a filter press plate, more particularly a centre feed filter press plate, which operates with a filter cloth on each side of the plate, a method for assembling the two part filter cloth on to the plate, and a method for manufacturing the two part filter cloth. Filter presses are a well known type of pressure filter made especially for liquid solid separations. Such presses include a series of filter plates which are compressed together between two heads. Covering each plate is a filter cloth which covers all the area where filtration occurs. Each plate typically includes an opening located within the filtration surface area, usually near the centre of the plate, and the plate has channels in its surface for passage of liquids. A solid liquid mixture enters through the opening, passes into the spaces between the plates, then the liquid portion passes through the filter cloths into the channels and leaves through an exit port for each plate. As the filtrate passes through the filter cloths, a cake of solids is built up in the spaces between the plates on the filter cloths. When the filter press is filled with solid filter cake material, the filtration is stopped, and the cake is either washed from the press or, alternatively, the press is opened, the plates separated, and the solid filter cake is removed. The filter cloth can then also be removed for washing or replacement. In the centre hole type press, a conventional filter cloth passes through the centre hole of the plate and covers both sides of the plate. Most of such filter cloths available for use are comprised of a single unit having two sides with an interconnected tubular centre hole section, the two sides of filter cloth usually being of unitary construction, and typically sewn together. This construction, while typical, is barely manageable if the filter cloth is stiff in nature or large in size, because one side of the cloth must be folded together and squeezed through the centre hole of the filter plate, then unfolded on the other side to cover the other side of the filter plate. This process is often very difficult and time consuming, particularly if the filter cloth must be changed frequently. An object of the invention is to provide a filter cloth assembly which can readily be assembled on the filter plate or disassembled from it and provides a good liquid tight seal with the plate. According to one aspect of the invention there if provided a filter cloth assembly for use on a centre feed filter plate of a filter press comprising first and second sections each including a filter cloth for disposal on opposite sides of said plate, said cloths having concentric holes adapted to align with a corresponding hole in said plate said first section including a tubular stem having a flanged base, said base being secured to a first said cloth and extending from said cloth in concentric alignment with said hole in said cloth and suitable for extending through said hole in said plate and mating with said second section disposed on the opposite side of said plate said second section including a flanged coupling member having a flanged base secured to the second cloth in concentric alignment with said hole in said second cloth, the coupling member of said second cloth adapted to fit closely and concentrically over the tubular stem of the first section extending from the hole in the plate when the cloths are assembled in place on opposite sides of the filter plate and means for effecting a liquid tight seal between the stem and the coupling member of said first and second sections when assembled together on the filter plate. The present invention also provides a method for bonding an otherwise adhesively incompatible thermosetting elastomer to other materials comprising The present invention further provides a method for bonding an otherwise bond incompatible thermosetting elastomer to other materials comprising The invention will now be particularly described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which In Fig. 1 there is shown a schematic cross sectional diagram of a filter press 10 containing conventional filter plates 12. The flow direction of slurry to be filtered and the outflow of filtrate are indicated by the arrows. The filter plates 12, when the assembly is completed, retain the filter cloths 14 in place, and the slurry flows to the cloths which collect the solids and allow the filtrate to pass through and leave the filter through outlet ports 15. The flange based stems 28 in the centre holes of each filter plate 12 are discussed in detail below. Referring to Fig. 2, there is shown a detailed schematic view of a filter cloth assembly for use on a centre hole type filter plate for use in a pressure filter press of the standard type, wherein a series of filter plates having filter cloths in place on each side are pressed together face to face such that a seal is formed at the edges of the plates between the stack of plates. The liquid solid mixture to be filtered is pumped through the centre hole of the press, the solids are retained on the filter cloths of the plates as the liquid flows through the filter cloths, and the filtrate flows from the press from outlet ports in the channels provided therefor within the area covered by the filter cloths. Filter cloth 14 is preferably a polypropylene or polyester textile felt or woven fabric to which is bonded to a polypropylene stem 28 having flange 30 as shown. The flange 30 and the attached stem 28 are moulded from a thermoplastic such as polypropylene, or other suitable thermoplastic materials, or from polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE material. Flange 30 is fuse bonded or bonded by means of a polypropylene hot melt or, in the case of a PTFE stem 28, a fluorinated ethylene propylene FEP or poly fluoro alkylene PFA polymer hot melt, to the cloth 14, thereby providing a liquid tight seal which prevents the liquid solid mixture from bypassing the filter cloth 14. Referring to Fig. 3, the bond between flange 30 and filter cloth 14 is indicated at 32. Other plastics may be used for the stem 28 and cloth 14 which will have equivalent properties. Stem 28 is bonded to cloth 14 on the right hand side of the plate 12 as seen in Fig. 3, and on the left hand side of plate 12 in Fig. 3 the extended portion of the stem 28, which extends through the hole of filter plate 12, mates with and is attached to the second filter cloth 14. Where stem 28 with moulded flange 30 is formed from PTFE, and the cloth is a PTFE felt or fabric filter cloth, stem 28 is preferably preformed or premoulded and then heat bonded, melt fused, or fuse bonded with heat and pressure to cloth 14 by a layer 32 of FEP or PFA heat fusible fluorocarbon polymer. Referring to both Figs. 2 and 3, filter cloth 14 preferably is a composition of a textile cloth 16 and a membrane 18 of expanded porous PTFE. Coupling 26 having flange 20 is preferably silicone rubber or Viton Registered Trade Mark fluoro elastomer, and is moulded in place on the filter cloth from liquid rubber or Viton fluoro elastomer and cured by a catalyst over a specified time and or is heat cured. Where stem 28 is formed from PTFE, coupling 26 is formed by moulding it in place on the filter cloth from Viton fluoro elastomer or fluoro silicone rubber. To assemble the filter cloths on the filter plate, the plate 12 is laid over one cloth 14 as shown such that stem 28 protrudes through the hole therein. The second cloth 14 is placed cloth down on plate 12 over stem 28 which closely fits through coupling 26 to close tolerance. In this configuration, the porous PTFE membrane 18 is always upstream of the textile layer 16. Tension strap or band clamp 24 is then placed in the groove 21 about coupling 26 and tightened to the degree necessary to ensure a liquid tight seal under the operating pressure being used with the filter press. The band 24 may be a standard metal band clamp or a plastic strap and lock. Fig. 3 shows the assembled filter cloths 14 on the filter plate 12. Flange 30 of stem 28 provides a positive clamping effect on filter cloth 14 as does the flange 20 of coupling 26 when coupling 26 is pressed onto the filter plate 12 and strap 24 is appropriately tightened and locked. Bond 32 is formed between filter cloth 14 and flange 20. A preferred method of manufacture of flanged coupling 26 is to preform or premould flanged coupling 26 from silicone rubber or Viton fluoro elastomer or other suitable thermosetting elastomeric materials which have equivalent properties. A method for bonding otherwise adhesively incompatible materials, for example, a fully cured silicone rubber coupling to a polypropylene textile felt filter cloth is depicted in Figs. 5 and 6. Therein is shown, in Fig. 5, a premoulded elastomeric coupling 36 of silicone rubber, into which a thermoplastic cloth, woven or felt or other similar material, has been pressed prior to full curing of the elastomer 36. The pressing is done so that the elastomer penetrates into the cloth but does not penetrate all the way through the cloth 38. Upon full cure of the elastomer, the cloth 38 is mechanically tightly bound to the elastomer 36 and presents an adhesivly compatible under surface of the composite coupling cloth which can be adhesively bonded to the various filter cloths 16 by adhesive 32 as shown in Fig. 6. The cloth 38 can be polyester or polypropylene or other similar plastic material. When using this method and the coupling 26, after the coupling of silicone rubber is fully cured, a silicone adhesive 32 such as silicone L is coated on the surface of flange 20 to be bonded and around the hole area on filter cloth 14, as depicted in Fig. 7, and heat and pressure are applied so that the silicone adhesive penetrates both the polypropylene felt 38 bonded to coupling 26 and the surface of cloth layer 16. As shown in Fig. 7, the expanded PTFE layer 18 has been removed from the bond region so as to provide the adhesively compatible surface of cloth layer 16 for bonding. When cure is complete, a strong, tenacious and leak proof bond 32 is formed. Alternatively, bond 32 may be formed without using an adhesive when the cloth 38 and the cloth layer 16 are both thermoplastics such as polypropylene or polyester. The bond is formed by applying heat and pressure to melt and fuse the cloths together. Additionally, the flanged coupling 26 of silicone rubber or fluoro elastomer could be moulded in place onto the filter mat felt around the hole and cured to solid form, with, again, penetration of the liquid rubber only partially into the interstices of the textile filter felt. By this method, silicone rubbers or fluoro elastomers can be made to form strongly bonded structures with a textile felt where the interstices of the felt are partially filled by the polymer, and the fibres of the felt link the two otherwise adhesively incompatible polymers together. Textile felts or woven fabrics of polymers other than polypropylene and polyester may be used where they provide equivalent properties. Fig. 4 is a cross section of the flanged coupling 26 which has been moulded with two beads 22 around the interior circumference, spaced so as to aid in forming a liquid tight seal around stem 28 where stem 28 may be uneven or out of round and also spaced such that pressure from strap or ring clamp 24 will centre between the two beads when clamp 24 is tightened. The most preferred filter cloth material 14 for use in the filter cloth assembly is a layered composite sheet of filter cloth containing an upstream layer 18 of porous expanded PTFE bonded to a woven or felt textile filter 18 cloth of polypropylene, polyester, or the equivalent of these in properties. The porous, expanded PTFE is prepared in accordance with one or more of U S patents 4,187,390 4,110,392 4,096,227 3,962,153 3,953,566 and 4,025,679. The PTFE surface minimizes adherence of filtered solids to the filter cloth and aids in rapid and easy cleaning of the cloth. When a filter cloth having a layer of porous expanded PTFE is used in the assembly of the filter, as mentioned above, the PTFE in the area of the cloth around the hole to be bonded to the flanges of stem 28 and coupling 26 must be removed so that the underlying polypropylene or polyester layer can be bonded to the flange. This can be done by a mechanical abrasion method, such as by using a wire brush or grit disc. Where the flanged stem 28 is made from PTFE, the PTFE layer of the composite filter cloth is usually not removed and the flange and cloth in this instance are joined by bonding the two parts together with a layer of FEP or PFA hot melted or fuse bonded by heat and pressure between them.
