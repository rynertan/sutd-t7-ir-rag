## Description
The present invention is concerned with a process for making flexible dipped rubber articles and, in particular, thin walled rubber gloves of the kind used by surgeons. Surgeon s gloves are difficult to don and to facilitate donning a powdered lubricant, such as particulate epichlorhydrin treated maize starch, is conventionally applied to the inner surface of the gloves. There is a risk of such powdered lubricant escaping from the interior of the glove to contaminate the surgical field, the lubricant escaping either during donning or, as sometimes happens, if the glove is punctured during an operation. Proposals have been made for polymeric lubricant coatings which are bonded to the inner surface of such gloves and which, because they are bonded, cannot escape from the glove. Examples of such proposals are in U.S. Patents 4070713 and 4143109, which disclose gloves which have an inner layer of elastomeric material with particulate lubricant embedded therein, and U.S. Patents 3813695, 3856561 and 4302852, which disclose surgeon s gloves with various polymeric slip coatings bonded to the inner surface thereof. French Patent 1434453 is a similar disclosure relating to dipped rubber articles in general. U.S. Patent 3813695 the Podell patent describes a surgeon s glove in which the glove material is formed of a laminate consisting of an outer layer of flexible material, for example rubber, and an inner layer of hydrophilic plastic material such as a hydrogel polymer , the inner and outer layers being bonded together. There are many known hydrogel polymers, examples of which are polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyhydroxyethyl acrylate or methacrylate, polyhydroxypropyl acrylate or methacrylate, and copolymers of these with each other or with acrylic or methacrylic acid, acrylic or methacrylic esters or vinyl pyridine. There are many disclosures of the coating of rubber articles, such as catheters and bathing caps, with such hydrogel polymers by dipping in a solution of a hydrophilic, hydrogel forming polymer and curing the resulting polymer layer. Examples of such disclosures include U.S. Patents 3326742, 3585103, 3607473, 3745042, 3901755, 3925138, 3930076, 3940533, 3966530, 4024317, 4110495, and 4125477, and British Patents 1028446 and 859297. It is conventional to make such flexible rubber articles by dipping a suitably shaped former in a rubber latex the rubber article is vulcanised on the former before being stripped from the latter. We have now found that in the production of hydrogel coated flexible rubber articles, a substantial advantage is obtained if the hydrogel layer is applied to the rubber before the latter is vulcanised, the hydrogel polymer being cured and the rubber vulcanised simultaneously in a single heat treatment. The surprising advantage obtained by this procedure is that the skin contacting hydrogel surface has a much cooler feel this may be because there is greater vapour transmission through the final coated article. According to the present invention, therefore, there is provided a process for making a flexible dipped rubber article having a lubricating layer formed from a hydrogel polymer bonded thereto so as to provide a skin contacting surface of said article, characterised in that the lubricating layer is formed by applying a coating of a solution of a hydrophilic hydrogel forming polymer to the dipped rubber article prior to the complete vulcanisation thereof, and heating the coated rubber article to cure the polymer and to complete vulcanisation of the rubber. The polymer solution is preferably applied by dipping. Any suitable hydrogel polymer may be used in the present invention, including the hydrogel polymers described in the prior documents mentioned above. It is preferred to use the hydrogel polymers which are copolymers of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate HEMA with methacrylic acid MAA and or with 2 ethylhexyl acrylate EHA which are described in our Application 105613 83305099.0 . The curing or cross linking of the hydrogel polymer generally reduces the water absorption of the polymer. After cross linking, the layer may be surface treated with a physiologically acceptable surfactant or long chain fatty amine this can enhance the lubricity of the layer with respect to damp skin. Such surfactants and fatty amines improve the lubricity with respect to damp skin for a wide range of hydrogel polymers as well as the specific 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate copolymers referred to above. The use of such surfactants and fatty amines is fully described in our Application 105613 83305099.0 already referred to. An article made according to the invention is preferably treated with a silicone liquid so as to reduce the surface tack on any surfaces not coated with a layer formed from the hydrogel polymer this treatment is preferably carried out at the same time as treatment with a surfactant as mentioned above. It is preferred that treatment with a silicone such as medical grade polydimethyl siloxane is carried out with a bath containing at least 0.05 by weight of silicone for example, 0.05 to 0.4 by weight . The rubber used in the article according to the present invention may be a natural or synthetic rubber natural rubber is preferred. The process according to the invention preferably comprises the steps of This process may optionally comprise the additional steps of Our tests have shown that, following step i , the damp skin slip properties and the dry skin slip properties of the coating formed from the hydrogel polymer are advantageously not impaired by subsequent washing that is, surfactant material is not leached out to any substantial extent on washing of the coated article . The application of the solution of surfactant material provides a substantially tack free outer surface that is, the surface not coated with hydrogel polymer , in addition to the inner surface, which is, of course, advantageous. The rubber surface to which the hydrogel polymer is bonded may also be primed by dipping in, for example, a solution of an aluminium salt after priming with dilute acid. It is a feature of the present invention that the production of the dipped rubber article, leaching, priming, application of hydrogel polymer layer, and vulcanisation of the rubber and curing of the polymer can all be carried out in a continuous operation. The present invention has been described primarily, with reference to surgeons gloves it is, however, applicable to other skin or tissue contacting flexible rubber articles, such as condoms, gloves used by doctors and veterinary surgeons for examination purposes such gloves being often donned with dry hands , catheters, urethers, sheets and sheath type incontinence devices. When the present invention is used for articles such as urethers and catheters, the layer formed from hydrogel polymer is provided on the outer surface this being the skin contacting surface for condoms the layer formed from hydrogel polymer may be provided on the inner surface and or on the outer surface. In order that the present invention may be more fully understood, the following Examples and Comparative Examples are given by way of illustration only. A thin dipped surgeons glove of natural rubber latex was leached with sulphuric acid, rinsed, primed by dipping in aluminium sulphate solution, dried out completely and then dipped into a 4 alcoholic solution of a copolymer of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate HEMA and methacrylic acid MAA in a 1 1 molar ratio, followed by drying. The solution contained, in addition to the copolymer, 5 parts per hundred of partially methylated melamine formaldehyde resin as cross linking agent and 0.5 parts per hundred of paratoluene sulphonic acid as catalyst . The rubber was then vulcanised, after which the lubricity with respect to dry skin was subjectively evaluated on a scale of 1 to 5, in which Example 1 was repeated, except that the copolymer was replaced by the polymers indicated in the following Table 1 In the above Table, the abbreviations have the following meanings In each of the Examples according to the invention, the coating adhered satisfactorily with at most very slight flaking. This also applied to the Comparative Examples, except Comparative Example 14 where the coating was washed off on wet stripping . The dry frictional force and the coefficient of friction for the glove of Example 6, the glove of Example 10 and for a conventional powdered glove are given in the following Table 2. The damp skin lubricity number was 2 for Examples 1 to 11 and Comparative Examples 2 to 10, 12, 13, and 15 to 20, and 1 for Comparative Examples 1, 11 and 14. Samples prepared as in Example 10 were post treated by dipping in solutions of various materials, as identified in the following Table 3. In each case, the dry slip was substantially unimpaired. Example 12 was repeated, using solutions containing various proportions of N CPC and also 0.3 medical grade polydimethyl siloxane, as indicated in the following Table 4. Similar results to those of Example 22 were obtained when the percentage of polydimethyl siloxane was 0.05 . A series of hand shaped formers were dipped into a natural rubber latex to produce a thin rubber layer on each former. The rubber layer was leached in hot water and then primed by dipping in dilute sulphuric acid, rinsed, dipped into a caustic soda bath or pH 10.5 containing hydrogen peroxide in an amount sufficient to react with hydrogen sulphide formed in the priming stage. The rubber, still on the formers, was then dipped into a 4 ethanolic solution of a HEMA MAA EHA terpolymer with a monomer molar ratio of 5 1 1.2, the solution also containing 5 to 15 parts per hundred based on the weight of polymer of partially methylated melamine formaldehyde resin available commercially as Cymel 373 as cross linking agent and 0.5 to 1.5 parts per hundred on the same basis of para toluene sulphonic acid as catalyst . The rubber was then vulcanised and the polymer simultaneously cured the temperature being raised from 80 to 150 C over 25 minutes during vulcanisation , the resulting gloves being stripped from the formers. The stripped gloves were washed with water and then tumbled in an aqueous solution containing 0.75 by weight of N cetylpyridinium chloride, the solution also containing 0.05 by weight of emulsified silicone. The gloves were finally tumbled dry at 65 C for 75 minutes. The resulting gloves had a dry skin lubricity number of 5 and a wet skin lubricity number of 4 on their polymer coated surfaces used as the insides of the gloves . No allergenic or irritant reaction to the gloves was reported, even when the gloves were worn by surgeons with hypersensitive skin. Example 1 was repeated except that the copolymer was replaced by a copolymer having the following molar percentage 80 HEMA, 10 MAA, 10 EHA. A dry skin lubricity number of 5 was obtained. A rubber coated porcelain mandrel was dipped for several minutes in water at above 70 C, rinsed in running water, and dipped in 2 sulphuric acid at 40 C. The coated mandrel was then dipped for neutralisation in dilute caustic pH 9 10 and then dipped in water wash tanks at 40 C. The coated mandrel was then coated with a 10 solution in ethanol of a terpolymer as used in Example 10, the solution containing 10 by weight of Cymel 370 cross linking agent and 1 by weight of p toluenesulphonic acid. The coated mandrel was heated in an oven for 30 minutes with temperatures rising to 105 C. The glove was stripped from the mandrel and immersed for 15 minutes in an aqueous dispersion of 0.05. of 35 Silicone medical grade emulsion DC365 Dow Corning brand containing 0.5 Cetylpyridinium chloride. After draining, the glove was heated and dried in an oven for 30 minutes at 70 C. The outer surface of the glove was tack free the inner coated surface was hydrophilic, had a high degree of slip and was readily donned on a dry hand a dry skin lubricity number of 5 . The moisture transmission properties at 25 C 100 RH of the resulting glove and an otherwise similar, but uncoated control , glove are set out in the following Table 5. Example 1 was repeated, except that the copolymer was replaced by the polymers indicated in the following Table 6. In each case, a dry skin lubricity number of 5 was obtained. Example 12 was repeated, using solutions of various surfactants instead of N CPC. The results are summarised in the following Table 7. Example 1 was repeated, except that the copolymer was replaced by a copolymer having the following molar percentage 70 HEMA, 10 MAA, 10 EHA. A dry skin lubricity number of 5 was obtained.
