# One step anticoagulant coating.

## Abstract
This invention relates to single step coating methods for coating substrates such as plastics or glass to impart properties to the substrate which are anticoagulant and hydrophobic, and to substrates so coated. The method is particularly useful in coating the internal surfaces of blood test vessels, such as microcontainers or VACUTAINERS for receiving blood samples for subsequent testing. The method herein imparts the desired properties to the vessel in a single step by combining silicone containing material in a water vehicle to which has been added a quantity of an anticoagu lant, such as heparin or ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid EDTA , followed by air drying.
