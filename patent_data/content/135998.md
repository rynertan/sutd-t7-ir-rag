# FLEXIBLE COATING COMPOSITION AND METHOD OF APPLYING SAME

## Abstract
A method of protecting surfaces of structural items from exposure to the elements, which includes forming first and second protective films upon the surface to be protected. The primary coating is an adherent coherent film having a formulation including 1 Methylmethacrylate copolymerfilm formers 2 A solvent system of toluene and 2 methoxyethanol 3 Fillers, such as SiO₂ 4 Miscellaneous solvents which is applied as a working film forming solution and per mitted to air dry. Thereafter, a secondary or top coating of an adherent coherent film is applied over the surface of the primary coating, with the top coat or secondary coating hav ing a formulation including 1 Thermoplastic Rubber 2 Fillers, such as SiO₂ and CaCO₃ 3 Tackifier 4 Heat and Light Stabilizers 5 Miscellaneous Solvents and applied in a working solution and permitted to air dry. The resulting layers provide a synergistic effect when se quentially applied, and result in an air tight film preventing the occurrence of either corrosion or rust, particularly when applied over metal surfaces.
