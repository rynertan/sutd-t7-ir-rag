## Description
PHARMACEUTICAL AND LITERARY COMPOSITION This invention relates to compositions for the treatment of various diseases and disorders primarily, but not exclusively, in the field of human redicine. Considerable interest has been shown in recent years in the use of prostaglandin PG precursors ifl medicine. For various reasons it is not practical to administer naturallyoccuring prestaglandins such as PGE 1 and PGE 2 to patients.Consequently, considerable attention has focussed on the use of prostaglandin presursors including linoleic acid 9,12 octadecadienoic acid , gamma linoleic acid 6,9,12 octadecatrienoic acid and dihomo gamma linoleic acid 5,8,11 eicosatrienoic acid , conversion in the body being believed to be as follows EMI1.1 tb SEP IS SEP oleic SEP acid tb SEP y Linolenic SEP acid tb SEP sterified tb Dihono y linolenic SEP acid tb SEP reserves SEP 1 SEP Prostaglandins tb SEP A SEP PrcstaglGndins tb Esterified SEP SEP S SEP Arachidor SEP ic SEP acid SEP of SEP the SEP 1 SEP series tb SEP reserves SEP 5, ,,lr SEP eicosatetraencic tb SEP aCis, tb SEP cstaglandins tb SEP o SEP the SEP 2 SEP series tb Prior art within this general area includes the following patents and papers. i U.S. Patents Nos. 3 993 775 issued November 23rd, 1976 and 4 058 594 issued November 15th, 1977 of.John Williams, which describe a method of providing an immuno suppressive effect in a patient undergoing organ or tissue transplant or suffering from multiple sclerosis comprising administration of a daily dosage of from S mg to 3 g of y linolenic acid or dihomo y linolenic acid or a functional derivative thereof. ii British Patent Specification No. 1 082 624, publishedSeptember 6th, 1967, Calmic Limited , which discloses effectiveness of y linoleniC acid in the treatment of vascular diseases. iii McCormack, Nei and Sim The Lancet, page 308, September 3rd, 1977 , who describe preliminary work on the use of an oil containing a mixture of linoleic acid and y linolenic acid as triglycerides in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. iv Sim and Mccraw nm ombosis Research Volume 10, pages 385 397, 1977 , who describe activity of the methyl esters of y linolenic acid and dihomo y linolenic acid in vitro and in rivo on blood platelet function in non human primates and in man. The present inventor has discovered a nurber of new applications of y linolenic acid and dihomo y linolenic acid in therapy, in conjunction with zinc and or ss lactam an,ibiotics, These are now described in turn.SCHIZOPHRENIA In the Lancet, page 936, April 30, 1977 the present inventor has suggested that schizophrenia is a prostaglandin deficiency disease. Schizophrenia is not a disorder which would suggest the use of immuno suppressive drugs. The specific suggestion was made that arachidonic acid, known to be a precursor of prostaglandins of the 2 series should alleviate schizophrenia. As a result of further research, the present inventor now believes that schizophrenia is due not to a deficiency of 2 seriesPG s but rather to a deficiency of PGE 1 and other PG s of the I series, of which arachidonic acid is not a precursor, or an imbalance in the normal ratio of 1 series and 2 series PG s. This has led to tile realisation that the materials which should be used to stimulate the natural production of 1 seriesPG s in the treatment of schizophrenia should include y linolenic acid and or dihcno y linolenic acid, either or both of which nay be used in associaticn with linoleic acid and if desire other fat acids. Although these substances are 2 series PG precursors via arachidonic acid as well as 1 series PG precursors, this is not deleterious to their use, although one may require to use relatively higher amounts of precursors than would be the case if only 1 series PG s were being biosynthesized.SKIN DISORDERS A further area where the administration or i series PG precursors is indicated is in the treatement of psoriasis and hunan. skin disorders such as acne, dandruff, eczema used hair icss other than that due to inherited male pattern baldness . The physiological basis for these treatements is in cetail but it is believed by the present nventor that conditions such as psoriasis, dandruff, eczema and hair loss are related to each other b common, or at least related, dects in 1 series Pc precursors metabolism, expressing themselves in various ways in different individuals. Experimental evidence of a relation is discussed belo in the section on veterinary application of the invention. Acne stands more on its own as a condition in particular of young ruales, but is certainly related to the metabolism of fatty materials in the skin.OBESITY A current technique for te treatment of obesity involves the administration of linoleic acid, generally in the form of vegetable oils such as sunflower oil and cr corn oil. In oroer to be effective, these current dietary approaches to the treatment of obesity require the intake of other fats in the diet to be substantially reduced. In the bony, linoleic acid is converted as described earlier and the present inventor believes that the beneficial effect of administration of linoleic acid is due to enhancement of 1 series PG production and in particular of PGE 1, this substance causing a metabolic shift increasing appetite and reducing weight.However, the presence of other fats in the diet interferes with the conversion of linoleic acid to y linolenic acid and thus reduces the effectiveness of the treatment. What is now proposed is administration of materials including y linolenic acid and or dihomo y linolenic acid or derivatives, as effective in the treatment of obesity, even when other fats are present in the diet.MENSTRUAL DISORDERS Menstrual disorders are not uncommon and while they do not usually require clinical treatment they are often a cause of distress or discomfort. Such disorders include extended periods of blood loss, sometimes for as long as 9 days cr more, especially when using intra uterine contraceptive devices exsGssive blood loss during menstrus, which is again often associated with the use of intra uterine contraceptive devices so called period paints premenstrual swelling associated with excessive fluid retention and irregular menstrual cycle lengths. The present inventor has now surprisingly found that the administration of materials including y linolenic acid and or dihomo y linolenic acid or derivatives causes a significant reduction in some or til of the above mentioned menstrual disorders. In tests which have been effected by the present inventor, it has been found that women previously exhibiting excessive periods of blood loss during menstrus experienced a reduction in this period to 3 to 5 days on treatment according to the invention In addition these tests have shown that a reduction in amount of blood loss, period pains and premenstrual swelling and a stabilisation of menstrual cycle lengths, may be achieved. The physiological explanation for the efficacy of the treatment is not fully understood. However, whilst not wishing to be bound by theoretical considerations, the inventor has noted that these types of menstrual disorders are often associated with obesity, which appears in at least some subjects to be due to a deficiency in essential fatty acids. USE OF ZINC As has been mentioned above, y linolenic acid and dihomo linolenic acid function as precursors for both 1 and 2 series PG s. The present inventor specifically believes it advantageous if the biosynthesis of 1 series nG s can be effected preferentially to that of 2 series PG s in cpnditions, not merely schizophrenia and the other applications discussed in some detail herein, but also the conditions treated according to the prior art discussed in which 1 series PG imbalances or lack need to be corrected. Without restriction to the theory, the present Inventor believes that ino tends to stimulate the bicsynthesis of 1 oils PG s and specifically that it potentiates mobilisation of esterified reserves of dihomo gamma linoleic acid. This enables one to use zinc conjointly with y linolenic acid and or dihomo gamma linoleic acid. ne presence of arachidonic acid or any other material tendir to oppose the PG 1 enhancing effect is to be avoided.USE OF ss LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS The use of y linolenic or other acids and derivatives w4th S lactea antibiotics is also valuable The present inventor believes that the reason for the effectiveness c the antibiotics is that, as he believer with zinc, they enhance utilisation of ester reserves of diho.o y linolenic acid. Whether or not this so, and no restriction to the theory is intended, zinc and anti biotics do appear to have parallel effects in treating all the conditions when used with the y linolenic or other acids and derivatives. It is also possible and has been found valuable to use both zinc and B lactem antibiotic conjointly with the y linolenic acid, dihcmo y linolenic acid or derivatives. FORMAL STATEMENT OF INVENTION The invention thus specifically provides a pharmaceutical or dietary composition comprising a y linolenic acid or physiologically functional derivative thereof and or dihomo gamma linolenic acid or physiologically functional derivative thereof and a conjoint amount of b physiologically assimilable zinc and or c a ss lactam antibiotic, alone or in an acceptable pharmaceutical or dietary vehicle. Alternatively, if it is not desired to have compositions comprising both the antibiotic and or zinc and the y linolenic or other acid or derivative, packs may be prepared comprising the active materials presented for separate administration, or two together and one separately, in the appropriate relative amounts, and such packs are within the purview of the invention.AMOUNTS OF y LINOLENIC AND OTHER ACIDS A preferred daily dosage for an adult weight ca 75 kg is from O.G5 or 0.1 up to 1, 2, 5 or even 10 g as required of ylinolenic acid or equivalent weight calculated as y linolenic acid of physiologically functional derivative thereof. Amounts may in particular be 0.1 to 1.0 g daily. In place of, or in addition to, y linolenic acid, one may use dihomo y linolenic acid or a physiologically functional derivative thereof, in amounts equivalent in molar terms to y linolenic acid and calculated as suchThis dosage can for example be taken as a single dose or divided into 2, 3, or 4 subdivisions thereof as convenient. PORTS AND SOURCES OF y LINOLENIC PND OTHER DIDS Convenient physiologically functional derivatives of ylinolenic acid and dihomo y linolenic acid for use for all the purposes described include the C1 C4 alkyl e.g. methyl and ethyl esters and the glycerides of the acids. If desired, pharmaceutical compositions may be produced for use in the invention by associating natural or synthetic ylinolenic acid or a physiologically functional derivative thereof and or dihomo y linolenic acid or a physiologically functional derivative thereof as such, with an acceptable pharmaceutical vehicle. It will however generally be convenient to incorporate the y linolenic acid into compositions in the form of an available oil having a high y linolenic acid content. At the present time known natural sources of oils having a high y linolenic acid content are few there are no known natural sources of significant amounts of dihomo y linolenic acid . One source of oils currently available is the seed of EveningPrimrose species such as Oenothera biennis L. and Oenothera lamarckiana, the oil extract therefrom containing y linolenic acid and linoleic acid in the form of their glycerides together with other glycerides. other source of y linolenic acid is the seed of Borage species such as Borago officinalis which, though its current yield per acre is low, provides a richer source of y linolenic acid than Oenothera oil. Recent studies on fungi which can be cultivated by fermentation promise a fungal oil source. The seed oil extracts referred to above can be used as such or can if desired be fractionated to yield an oily composition containing the triglycerides of y linolenic acid and linolelc cid as the only fatty acid components, the y linolenic acid cott being a major proportion. Seed oil extracts appear to have a stabilising effect upon any dihomo gamma linoleic acid or physiologically functional derivative thereof incorporated therein.AMOUNTS A4D FORMS OF ZINC Based on present evidence, a suitable daily dosage of zinc for an adult weight ca 75 kg is 2.5 800 mg preferably 10 200 mz and advantageously 10 80 mg zinc daily, with gamma linoleic acid cr other acid or eauivalent in the amounts previously discussed.The 10 80 mg zinc is approximately 0.125 1.0 mg kg adult body weight. In view of the conjoint effect of the zinc preferred amount of y linolenic or other acid or equivalent are less than when zinc is not present, advantageously 0.1 to 1.0 g daily. As before the dosage can be taken as a single dcse or divided into 2, 3 or 4 subdivisions thereof. The zinc should be administered in a form in which it is readily taken up in vivo. Ordinarily this will indicate the use of a zinc salt of a rineral or organic acid, said salt being physiologically acceptable at the given dosage. Some zinc salts which would be contra indicated at higher dosages may be satisfactory for present purposes at the dosages indicated above. Useful salts include zinc sulphate and zinc gluconate and in particular zinc oleate, y linolenate and dihomo y linolenate, and zinc oxide may also be employed. It is also possible to administer the zinc in chelated form.In any event, the preferred amounts of zinc are as stated above the quantities given being calculated as zinc metal KINDS AND AMOUNTS OF ANTIBIOTIC S lactam antibiotics which may be used according to the present invention, are conveniently any of the known penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics including semi synthetic antibiotics such as, for example, penicillin G, penicillin N, penicillin V, cephalexin, cephalothin, ampicillin, amoxycillin, cloxacillin and cephalogylcin. Any of these may be used in the form of their physiologically functional non toxic derivatives, for example alkali metal salts e.g. sodium and potassium salts, and salts with organic bases, and reference to an antibiotic herein including the claims includes reference to such derivatives. The antibiotic is preferably administered in daily dosages of for example 0.5 to 3.0 g per day in patients of average weight.Such daily dosages may conveniently be divided into for example, two, three or four equal doses to be administered two, three of four times daily respectively.SPECIFIC TNDIC2 TTONS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA In severely disturbed patients it may be desirable to additionally administer conventional trancuillizers in addition to regular treatment with the compositions of the invention, but this is only requied when such patients experience extreme agitation, insomnia or hallucinations. The use of penicillins in the long term treatment of schizophrenia is especially desirable in view of the known relative absence of side effects of these drugs. Thus, penicillin has been administered for many years to patients having rheumatic heart disease in order to prevent streptococcal infections, and there is virtually no evidence of long term toxicity. Care should of course be taken to ensure that the patient is not allergic to the drug of choice. With respect to the known ability of penicillins to produce reactions in some patients due to penicillin hypersensitivity, there is evidence to suggest that schizophrenics have a reduced incidence of allergic reactions anmore particularly of penicillin hypersensitivity.Thus, the problem, usually associated with penicillin antibiotic therapy, of hypersensitization in a small number of patients, is not quite so important in the treatement of schizophrenia using penicillin A valuable benefit of the present invention is that the hitherto extensively used chemotherapeutic agents for schizophrenia have been associated with a tranquillizing activity, qith the resul that the use of these drugs in therapy is combined with an often undesired heavy sedation of the patient. Also such dgs nay DO responsible for the production of irreversible damages in up to 70 of patients to those parts of the brain which control movesAvoidance or substantial avoidance of the use of these drugs is thus of great value.DIETARY COMPOSITIONS The invention is chiefly described in teis of pharm. c compositions, but it will be understood that the linoleic end other acids, being in the nature of dietary supplements, could if available at an economic price be incorporated in a dietary or other foodstuff such foodstuffs, referred to herein as compositions, are within the purview of the invention.VETERINARY APPLICATIONS It will be understood that where a disorder of re kind call for treatment in animals arises, the invention while described primary in terms of human medicine and treatement is equally applicable in the veterinary field. Thus for example domestic cats have an unusual dietary requirement in essential fatty acids, being apparently unable to convert linoleic acid to y linolenic acid and dihomo gamma linoleic acid to aracnidonic acid. They are liable to a group of related skin conditions with hair loss, dandruff, scaling, pruritis, easy breakdown of the skin with rubbing or scratching, and defective heaiing, all of which can also be produced experimetally by anEFA essential fatty acid deficient diet, evidencing their related nature.Similar conditions can be produced experimentally in other animals, with skin lesions similar to eczema and psoriasis.Feeding of y or dihomo y linolenic acid is effective in reversing the conditions, including, perhaps surprisingly, those in cats.This indicates, in view of the arachidonic acid block, that the conditions are indeed, as the present inventor believes also for the human skin conditions discussed above, related to 1 series PG deficiencies. The spontaneous conditions observed in cats are for example relived by giving 0.5 g of Oenothera oil and zinc 20 ing as sulphate, per day, five days a week.PHARMACEUTICAL PRESENTATION The compositions according to the invention are conveniently in a form suitable for oral, rectal, parenteral or topical administration in a suitable pharmaceutical vehicle, as discussed in detail for example in U.K. Patent Specification No. 1 082 624 and in any case known generally according to the type of preparation. Tnus for example tablets, capsules, ingestible liquid or powder preparations, creams and lotions for topical application, or suppositories, can be prepared as require. Advantageously a preservative such as tocopr.erol is incorporated into the preparations. c TocoSherol in a concentration of about 0.1 by weight has been found suitable for the purpose. It will be understood that the absolute quantity of active ingredients present in any dosage unit should not exceed that appropriate to the rate and manner of administration to be employed but on the other hand should also desirably be ace3cate to allow the desired rate of administration to be acrteved by a small number of doses. The rate of administration will moreover depend on the precise pharmacological action desired. The following Examples serve to illustrate pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention EXAMPLES Pharmaceutical compositions containing a unit dose of an oil extract from the seeds of Oenothera biennis L.optionally with methyl dihomo y linolenate and with zinc in suitable form and or penicillin V are prepared by encapsulation of the natural oil in soft gelatin capsules manufactured by known methods. The oil is extracted from the seeds by one of the conventional methods of extraction such as cold pressure, screw pressure after partially cooking the seed, or solvent extraction. Fractionation of a typical sample of this oil shows a yield of 97.0 oil in the form of methyl esters, with the relative proportions Palmitate 615 Stearate 1.6 Oleate 10.15 Linoleate 72.6 gamma Linoleante 8.9As preservative, a tocorherol is added to the oil in a concentration of 0.1 . Gelatin capsules containing oil extracts prepared as described above, each having the following contents ol active ingredients 0.5 g oil extract ca 0.045 g y linolenic acid , are prepared in conventional fashion. The zinc may ccnvenently be incorporated as zinc oleate made by the method disclosed in Monatschrift 42 287 1921 , and similar methods may be applied to make or example zinc y linolenate if desired. EXAMPLE 1 Oil extract 0.5 g Zinc sulphate 10 mg Two capsules may be administered thrice daily in the treatment of schizophrenia or menstrual disorders, giving a daily dose of y linolenic acid of ca 0.27 g. Similar capsules with 20 mg zinc sulphate may be administered in the treatment of acne, psoriasis, eczema, dandruff and loss of hair, or of obesity. EXA iE 2 Oil extract 0.5 g Methyl dihomo y linolenate 10 mg Zinc sulphate 10 mgTwo capsules may be administered thrice daily in the treatment of schizophrenia. EXAMPLE 3 Oil extract 0.5 g Penicillin V 0.25 gTwo capsules may be administered thrice daily in the treatment of schizophrenia. EXAMPLE 4 Oil extract 0.5 g Penicillin V 0.25 g Zinc sulphate 10 mgTwo capsules may be administered thrice daily in the treatment of schizophrenia. EXAMPLE 5 Oil extract 0.5 g Methyl dihomo gamma linoleate 10 mg Penicillin V 0.25 g Zinc sulphate 10 mgTwo capsules may be administered thrice daily in the treatment of schizophrenia. EXAMPLE 6 Oil extract 0.5 g Methyl dihomo y linolen te 10 mgTwo capsules may be administered thrice daily in the treatment of menstrual disorcers. EVIDENCE OF EFF DACY The conditions are considered in turn.SCHIZOPERENIA Use of Oenothera Oil and Penicillin A female patient aged 24 who had suffered for 20 years from severe schizophrenia and was aggressive, paranoid and hypochondriacal in spite of conventional drug treatment with haloperidol 10 mg tds plus flupenthixol decanoate 40 mg month , was given Oenothera oil 2 x 0.6 ml capsules qds and penicillin V 250 mg qds . There was some initial nausea and headache but after two weeks hypochondiriacal delusions ceased and after six weeks paranoid delusions, aggressiveness and incongruity of affect had also disappeared. Further, 6 kg in weight were lost in the course of 16 weeks in spite of a regular diet. A further, male patient of 31 had suffered from severe schizophrenic illness for 12 years and had been an in patient for 7 years, aggressive, hearing voices, of wild string appearance and nct speaking spontaneously to others. He had been receiving fluphenazine decanoate 75 mg every two weeks, benzhexol 5 mg three times a day and supplementary chlorpromazine as required. Be was taken off these drugs and given Oenothera oil and penicillin as above for one month and an increase to 3 capsules qds in the oil thereafter. Over a period of six months he became co operative, not easily upset by fellow patients, without aggressions,speaking spontaneously and appropriately to others, and with almost normal affect.His ERPS score dropped from 44 to 21 over the period. Four other severe cnronic schizopherenics controlled by phenothiazines were withdrawn from them and given the Cenothera oil and penicillin. The condition of each was maintained without the side effects of the other drugs.Use of Oenothera oil, Pencillin and Zinc Preliminary trials with a small group of similar patients to thsse in the previous trials have been promising on the following Oenothera oil 6 or 8 x 0.6 ml capsules day Penicillin 250 mg gds Zinc, as sulphate 20 to 40 mg daySKIN DISORDERS Acne and psoriasis are two common and intractable conditions that have shown favourable results with treatment according to the invention. A group of sufferers from severe acne, of 7 young men, received Oenothera oil 0.6 ml zinc sulphate 20 mg, 6 capsules daily. All showed improvement in terms of reduction both in the number of inflamed facial pustules and in sebum production rate, over a period of 4 to 6 weeks. After three months all the subjects showed a very substantial improvement, most being essentially clear of pustules. A group of 4 subjects with psoriasis was given similar treatment. In all, scaliness and itching were reduced. In no case was there a full cure, but psoriasis is a particularly intractable condition in which even a modest improvement is clinically significant. No clinical trials have been done on hair loss, but in a group of 30 laboratory rats maintained on a zinc deficient diet, hair loss was reversed by feeding of Oenothera oil with zinc, the effect being greater than when zinc was given alone. Preliminary results with eczema using Oenothera oil and zinc together have given favourable indications, as found with psoriasis. Dandruff also responded favourably in two individuals otherwise wholly healthy.OBESITY Thirty eight healthy subjects initially took Oenothera oil in 0.6 ml capsules for 6 8 weeks, thirty four of them at 6 capsules a day and four at eight capsules a day, while continuing to eat their normal diets. Twenty two of the subjects, all taking 6 capsules a day, were initially within 105 of their ideal body weight according to the standard life tables. None gained or lost more than 2 kg. The other sixteen subjects were all more th n 10 above their ideal body weight. Of this group, two women and three men showed no change in weight. They were taking 6 capsules a day. Six women and five men lost weight, as follows Initial mean weight kg 74.55 7.94 S.D. Final mean weight kg 70.42 6.52 p 0.5, paired t test Of the subjects who lost weight, four who were taking 8 capsules a day lost 8.2, 10.0, 10.9 and 12.7 kg respectively. All the other subjects who lost weight were taking 6 capsules a day. These results indicate that overweight individuals, but not those of normal weight, have a good chance of losing weight by simple inclusion of Oenothera oil in the diet, and that the weight loss is dose related. No adverse effects were observed. The intake of 6 capsules a day, 3.6 ml of the oil, is equivalent to ca 0.27 g of y linolenic acid of 8 capsules a day, 4.8 ml of the oil, ca.36 g of y linolenic acid. Preliminary results indicate improvement in terms of weight loss and proportion of subjects responding, when capsules containing 20 mg zinc sulphate in addition to the oil are used.MENSTRUAL DISORDERS A group of 15 women of reproductive age was treated, four of whom were using an intrauterine contraceptive device and all of whom were suffering from prolonged menstrus of 8 to 12 days with excess blood loss. of these cent 5 also suffered from the premenstrual syndrome of depression, pain and fluid retention. ritual administration of Oenothera oil 6 x 0.6 ml capsules daily over a period of several months consistently reduced the duration of blood loss to 3 to 5 days with concomitant reduction in the amount. The sympotome of the premenstrual syndrome in those women showing it became mild, or in one instance disappeared entirely and stayed gcne for 3 full cycles, up to the end of the trial. Preliminary results indicate a further improved effect of oil capsules administered with 20 ng zinc sulphate.USE OF ZINC Substantial clinical results are not at present available on all the conditions for which the use of zinc is proposed, but the present inventor believes, whithout wishing to be limited to the theory, that at the root of all the conditions lies a fault in prostaglandin metabolism whereby PG s of the 1 series are lacking or their balance with 2 series PG s is upset. From evidence such as that listed below the inventor believes that zinc increases formation of 1 series PG s selectively, apparently by mediating the mobilisation from ester resource of dihemo y linolenic acid. Thus zinc is indicated in all the conditions described herein, as favouring 1 series PC synthesis specifically from administered y linolenic acid and related materials. In one group of experiments the test preparation was the isolated superior mesenteric vascular bed, taken from male rats as for example described in the Canadian J. Physiol Pharmacol 54 357, 1976. The perfusion flow rate was at a constant value between3 to 4 ml min., pressure 25 to 30 mm Hg, using Krebs bicarbonate buffer containing in nM 150 Na, 4.3 K, 1.0 Mg, 2.5 Ca, 1.7 phosphate, 25 bicarbonate and 11.1 glucose. Prior to testing the basic vasoconstrictive effect of norepinephrine, as the bitartratem in successive 10 ng amounts was established, as the amplitude of a transient rise of about 1 min in the perfusion pressure. Zinc, as the phate, was then added to the perfusion bffr at successive concentrations and the norepinephrine response measured after 15 minute at each. The follcwing results were obtained Zinc concentration Response as g ml of basic level 0.1 112 0.2 118 0.4 130 0.8 138 In the presence of 50 vg ml of indomethacin, 2 known blocking agent for PG synthesis, used with 10 ng ml PG 2 to give apparently normal vascular reactivity, the zinc had no effect on the norepinesphrine response. Similar tests with dihomo gamma linoleic acid and PG 1 gave respective rises up to a maximum of 130t of the basic response at 50 ng ml of the acid and a maximum of 150 of the basic response at 2.8 x 10 11M PG. The results show that zinc gives response like those of dihcmo y linolenic acid and of PGE 1, responses moreover which are not given when PC synthesis is blocked and PGS 2 supplied, and thus that conditions treated with y linolenic acid and thus effectively with dihomo y linolenic acid may be enhanced in the direction of 1 series PG synthesis by the addition of zinc. USE OF ANTIBIOTICS On tests carried out as above, both penicillin V and penicillinG have given responses similar in kind and degree to those given for zinc, supporting further the inventor s believe that ss lactam antibiotics are of value in all other conditions treated according to the invention, in similar wav to the action of zinc, and as evidenced in the results on schizophrenia.
