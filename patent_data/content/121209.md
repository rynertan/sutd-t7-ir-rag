# Diffusion bonding of aluminum alloys.

## Abstract
Diffusion bonding of aluminium alloys is performed using a thin alloy interlayer placed between mating surfaces of the alloy members to be bonded, the interlayer having a specific composition which is dependent upon the composition of the alloy members, the diffusion bonding temperature, the inter diffusion rates of the alloy members compared with the inter layer, and the solid state diffusion rate of the interlayer into the alloy members. The process is preferably further charac terized by isothermal solidification of the interlayer after the diffusion bonding temperature has been reached.
