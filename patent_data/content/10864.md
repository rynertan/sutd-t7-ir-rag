# Gas driven dental handpiece having vibration isolating means.

## Abstract
A gas driven dental handpiece having vibration isolat ing means has a handle in two parts 25, 27 . A joint is provided by a shaft 36 from the end of one part which fits in a chamber 42 in the end of the other shaft, leaving a small annular gap 43 between them which is occupied by resilient O rings 40, 41 or the like, under compression. A small axial gap 35 is also provided between the parts 25, 27 so that they are not in direct contact, and the O rings 40, 41 provide a rigid joint while reducing the trans mission of vibration. A pin 49 may be provided, normally out of contact with one or other of the parts, to prevent relative axial or rotational displacement of the parts. The joint may be provided elsewhere in the handpiece for example between the head and the handle.
