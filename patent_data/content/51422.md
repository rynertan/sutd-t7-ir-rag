# High speed digital processor.

## Abstract
A digital signal processor comprising interface means for data input output with an external device a first data bus 21 which has a predetermined number of bits and which is connected to the interface means data memories 5, 6 connected to the data bus a second data bus 22 onto which a data from the data memories is read out a floating point multiplier 14 connected with the first and second data buses and for adding exponent parts and multiplying mantissa parts of a pair of data applied, to deliver an operated result having a number of bits larger than that of the first data bus a floating adder subtracter 15 including an input selection portion selecting a pair of data appointed by a program instruction from amongst a plurality of data containing the output of the multiplier, and for adding subtracting said pair of data an accumulator 16 for holding a data delivered from the adder subtracter and having a number of bits larger than that of the first data bus a third data bus 27 which has a number of bits larger than that of the first data bus and which supplies an output of said accumulator to said input selection portion of said adder subtracter a switching circuit 17 connected between said accumulator and the first data bus and for reducing the number of bits of the output data of the accumulator and then supplying the resultant data to the first data bus and a control circuit 4 for controlling the operations of the respective means in accordance with program instructions.
