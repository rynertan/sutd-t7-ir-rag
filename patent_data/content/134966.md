# A battery powered key entry device including a processor and a power conservation system.

## Abstract
In a self contained battery powered key entry device, the keyboard 2 is driven from a microprocessor 1 and its output sensed by the microprocessor to generate drive signals for an infra red transmitter 24 . The sense lines DB0 DB7 are monitored so that, on a key depression, the microprocessor is switched to an operating mode from its low power standby mode. When all sensed signals have been processed and outputted, the microprocessor is re turned to the low power standby mode. A delay may be incorporated.
