# ELUTRIATOR

## Abstract
An elutriator 1 for separating different grades of leaf vegetable material comprises an elutriation zone 17 disposed above distribution means, and gaseous supply means 13 for supplying a gaseous medium to the elutriation zone 17 through the distribution means. The distribution means is adapted to provide a substantially uniform flow of gaseous me dium to the elutriation zone 17 , and the velocity of air deliv ered to the zone is greater than the terminal velocity of at least one grade of the material to be separated.
