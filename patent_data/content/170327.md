# Driving system for a cross country vehicle.

## Abstract
Two sided drive for a cross country vehicle provided with an engine and a variable main drive with reversal device coupled to two similar planetary gear units of which a. the planet bearers of the units are coupled to the out going shafts of the propulsion mechanism chainwheel with tracks b. the sun gears or ring gears are coupled via a shaft and a gear transmission, which shaft intermediate shaft can be rotated clock wise or anti clock wise by a variable steering drive which is driven by the engine c. the ring gears or the sun gears are coupled to the main drive, wherein, i the coupling shaft 5 of both sun gears 51, 5r also carry a pulley 2 of a continuously variable drive belt transmission 2 ii The second pulley 2 of this continuously variable drive belt transmission 2 is connected to the engine 1 via a clutch 12 or a break 13 with reversal device 14 iii a second variable drive belt transmission 3 is provided which is coupled at one side with the engine 1 and at the other side with the intermediate shaft 4 via the steering differential 11 which shaft can rotate the ring gears of both collecting differentials 61, 6r in opposite directions but with the same velocities.
