# Imbalance compensating vehicle wheel attachment.

## Abstract
An imbalance compensating vehicle wheel attachment has a rim structure 12 for mounting to a vehicle wheel, and further has a plurality of spokes or sectors 18 coupled to the rim structure 12 and extending radially inwardly to a hub structure 16 . Amounting arrangement 20,22 is provided to couple the inward extremities of the sectors 18 to the hub structure 16 to enable radial slidable movement of the sec tors 18 relative to the hub structure 16 whereby the masses of the hub structure 16 and sectors 18 are dynamically movable to establish a radius of gyration tending to compen sate for any wheel imbalance.
