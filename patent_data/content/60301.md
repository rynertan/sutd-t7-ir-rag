## Description
SPECIFICATION METHOD FOR PREPARATION OF CEPHALOSPORIN COMPOUNDSTECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a method for the preparation of cephalosporin compounds. More particularly, it relates to a method for the safe and efficient preparation of a compound represented by the general formula III EMI1.1 wherein R represents hydrogen or methyl group or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof which has an acid resistance and a strong bactericidal activity against a wide range of microorganisms includingGram positive and Gram negative pathogens and has already been marketed as an excellent antibiotic.BACKGROUND ART Heretofore, the compound represented by the general formula III have been prepared in two steps from 7 aminocephalosporanic acid as the starting material. Among the methods for obtaining the compound III , there are, for example, a method in which at first 7 lH tetrazol l ylacetamido cephalosporanic acid is obtained from 7 aminocephalosporanic acid and 1H tetrazole l acetic acid Japanese Patent Publication 5,150 71 and then it is reacted with a 1,3,4 thiadiazole 5 thiol Japanese Patent Publication 14,736 71 to obtain the intended compound of the general formula III and a method in which 7 amino 3 1,3,4 thia diazol 5 yl thiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid is synthesized by the reaction of 7 aminocephalosporanic acid with a 1,3,4 thiadiazole 5 thiol Japanese PatentPublication 17,936 64 and then it is reacted with lH tetrazole l acetic acid to obtain the compound of the general formula III Japanese Patent Publication 35,751 71 . These methods each comprises a combination of two entirely independent reactions, the one being the acylation of the amino group at the position 3 of 7 aminocephalosporanic acid and the other the replacement of the acetoxy group in the acetoxymethyl group at the position 3 with a thiazolethio group.These two reactions proceed under different conditions and even if the two reactions are carried out consecutively, it is impossible to avoid an interruption of the reaction which is associated with the alteration of reaction conditions. Further, the cephalosporin compound becomes exposed to the conditions severe for its stability, i.e. a pH of 6.5 and a temperature of 600 C, for 3 to 6 hours in the former step of the abovenoted two step reaction and for 4 to 8 hours in the latter step. Thus, the decrease in yield of reaction product has posed a major problem from the economical viewpoint.It is also plausible that in purifying the intended product formed by consecutive reactions, the influence of unreacted starting materials and the impurities such as the compounds formed by decomposition is not negligible and, as a consequence, leaves a problem on the purity of the final product. As for the work conditions and safety, conventional methods have a serious defect in the moisture instability and the human skin irritating effect of the acylating agents which are commonly used in acylating the position 7 by the method of acyl chloride, mixed acid anhydride or DCC condensation. In the replacement of acetoxy group at the position 3, on the other hand, although alkaline conditions are favorable for the enhancement of elimination reaction, yet the rapid skeletal decompositoin of cephalo type compounds under such conditions compels the reaction to be carried out under nearly neutral conditoins where the reactivity is at a low level and the reaction requires a long time at 600C for its completion, meaning a serious drawback from the economical viewpoint. Because of the aforementioned defects, conventional methods are entirely unsatisfactory on an industrial scale. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present inventors conducted extensive investigations on a process which overcomes the defects of conventional methods and permits the safe and efficient preparation of a compound of the general formula III or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and, as a result, found that a benzimidazolethio group bound to the methyl group at the position 3 of 7 amino 3 benzimidazol 2 yl thiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acidEMI4.1 or a salt thereof is a leaving group having a high reactivity under the acidic conditions favorable for the stability of the cephalo skeleton and that a compound represented by the general formula II EMI4.2 wherein R represents hydrogen or methyl group is a highly reactive group capable of efficiently introducing both the two substituent groups of the intended compound represented by the general formula III under identical conditions without interrupting the progress of reaction. It was further found that by using a combination of above noted two compounds as starting material it is possible to achieve the object of said investigations, leading to the accomplishment of this invention. Thus, the present invention provides a method for the preparation of a cephalosporin compound represented by the general formula III EMI5.1 wherein R is as defined above or a salt thereof, which comprises reacting 7 amino 3 benzimidazol 2 yl thiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid or a salt thereof with a compound represented by the general formula II EMI5.2 wherein R is as defined above BEST MODE FOR CARRING OUT THE INVENTION The compound I used as a starting material in this invention is characterized in that the benzimidazolethio group bound to the methyl group at the position 3 is a leaving group which shows a high reactivity in the presence of proton.Proton is believed to catalyze the elimination reaction and the proton of the thiols present in the reaction system can be utilized to advantage so that in this case there is no need to add anew an acid catalyst. Analogous substituent groups to be bound to the methyl group at the position 3 include a benzthiazolethio group and a benzoxazolethio group.Although, in fact, the reaction proceeds with these substituent groups, a most distinguished effect is exhibited particularly by the benzimidazolethio group.Since this substituent group undergoes the replacement reaction very rapidly in the acidic region where the cephalo compounds are stable, its efficacy in terms of material yield is twice or more as much as that of the acetoxy group used in conventional methods. The compound I can be obtained by the method already known by itself. It is obtained, for example, by the known reaction between the commercial 7 aminocephalosporanic acid and the 2 mercaptobenzimidazole already used as an antioxidant for polymers and is sold on the marpet at a low price. It is also obtained by reacting 7 glutaramido cephalosporanic acid with 2 mercaptobenzimidazole and then cleaving the amide linkage in the side chain attached at the position 7 by the action of 7 4 carboxybutanamido cephalosporanic acid acylase disclosed in Japanese Patent ApplicationLaid open No. 101,584 75. The compound represented by the general formula II which is used as the other starting material is not a mere acylating agent. It is a single compound having both reactive groups, the one being capable of acylating at the position 7 of cephalosporanic acid and the other being capable of substituting at the position 3. It is highly active and has a great advantage of efficiently advancing the reaction, resulting in a high yield of the intended compound III . More particularly, the reactivity of the compound II is comparable to that of an acyl chloride or a mixed acid anhydride which has been said to be of highest activity. It has been known as one of the disadvantages of conventional acylating methods that unless the reaction temperature is strictly controlled, side reactions tend to occur, thereby decreasing the efficiency, whereas in the case of the compound II side reactions including polymerization and decomposition will not take place at a temperature in a usually practicable temperature range of, for example, from room temperature up to 800C. One of the other known acylating techniques is the method of active thioesters such as, for example, phenyl thioester of a carboxylic acid.This method is not applicable to the cephalo compounds because of severe reaction conditions involving the presence of a strong alkali, a high temperature and a long reaction time extending to several hours, while if this method is used under mild conditions, the acylation will not proceed see Comparative Example 1 .It is indeed an unexpected and surprising fact that although being a type of thioesters, the compound II is a reagent of high reactivity under mild conditions. The compound II is yellow columnar crystals which are nonhygroscopic, non irritating and noncorrosive, contributing greatly to the ease in handling, to the safety of working environment and workers, and to the maintainance of equipments. Therefore, in practice it is really an excellent starting material without parallel. Further, it is to be noted about the compound II that although being a single compound, it is able to participate simultaineously in two reactions, is highly active and when combined with the high susceptibility of the compound I to elimination reaction, it can increase the efficiency of the reaction and reduce the reaction time, contributing greatly also to the economy of the present preparative process. The advantage of the present invention in transforming the compound III at the positions 7 and 3 may be expressed in terms of numerical value in the following way in conventional methods, the overall yield of the isolated compound III is 10.4 when the procedures of Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 5,150 71 and 14,736 71 are combined and 34.5 when the procedures of Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 17,936 64 and 35,751 71 are combined, whereas the yield jumps up to 95 according to this invention. The compound II may be prepared in a high yield by reacting a l,3,4 thiadiazole 5 thiol represented by the general formula IV EMI9.1 wherein R represents hydrogen or methyl group or a derivative thereof with lH tetrazole l acetic acid or a derivative thereof in a solvent at 50 to 1000C Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 20,711 80 . The intended compound represented by the general formula III or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be easily and efficiently derived from the reaction in a solvent between the compound represented by the general formula I obtained above or a salt thereof and the compound represented by the general formula II . The amount of compound II should be equimolar or more to the amount of compound I , preferably 1.0 to 2.0 moles from the economical viewpoint. Preferred solvents are amldes such as N,N dimethylformamide,N,N diethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, and N,N diethylacetamide or those containing water. Other solvents are, for example, ethers such as MethylCellosolve, aliphatic ketones such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane and chloroform, nitriles such as acetonitrile and propionitrile, and sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide and diethyl sulfoxide. The reaction can proceed by using these solvents each alone or in mixtures or in mixtures with water.Of these solvents, amides such as N,N dimethylformamide and N,N dimethylacetamide or mixtures of amides with water are especially preferred in view of solubility, conversion and economy. Since one of the features of the present method is the presence of thiol compounds in the reaction system, which are formed from the compound II and by the replacement reaction, the additional acid catalyst is not necessary. However, it is preferable for the reduction in reaction time and the improvement in the yield of reaction product to add acld catalysts including mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid and organic acid including sulfonic acids such as p toluenesulfonic acid and methanesulfonic acid, fatty acids such as propionic acid, and thiols such as 2mercaptothiadiazole. With respect to yield and reduction in reaction time, mineral acids and thiols are preferred. A sufficient amount of additional acid catalyst is substantially 0.05 mole or more per mole of compound I The reaction temperature depends upon the presence or absence of the catalyst and the type of solvent. Although a suitable temperature range is from 100 to 1000 C, the particularly preferred temperature range is from 300 to 800C in view of the conversion and the stability of cephalosporin skeleton. Although depending upon the presence or absence of the catalyst and the type of solvent, a sufficient reaction time is generally in the range of from 30 minutes to 10 hours. For instance, a reaction time of 30 minutes to 4 hours is sufficient for the reaction conducted in the presence of an acid catalyst in aqueous N,N dimethylformaldehyde at 600C, whereas a reaction time of 8 to 18 hours is necessary in the conventional methods when the acylation at the position 7 and the replacement reaction at the position 3 are conducted consecutively. The method of this invention is very simple and economically superior when the side reactions between the reactants and the decomposition of the reaction products are taken into account. The intended compound in this invention may be isolated in crystalline form by extraction of the reaction mixture in a customary manner or if an anhydrous solvent was used, by converting into sodium or potassium salt in a customary manner. If necessary, the cephalosporin compound represented by the general formula III obtained according to this invention can be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The conversion into an alkali metal salt, ammonium salt, or an alkaline earth metal salt can be effected in a customary manner.These salts show excellent properties, such as, for example, solubility in water, which are useful in formulating a drug preparation According to this invention, it is possible to prepare safely and in a high yield cephalosporin compounds represented by the general formula III and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which are excellent antibiotics having high antimicrobial activites.
