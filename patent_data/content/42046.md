## Description
METHOD OF, AND APPARATUS FOR, MANUFACTURING LAMINATED DYN MOELECTRIC MACHINE STRUCTURES Description Background of the Invention Field of the InventionThis invention relates to laminated assemblies for electric motors. More particularly, this invention pertains to a method of forming such assemblies from stock material in a progressive die in an improved manner. Description of the Prior ArtIn the art of making laminated assemblies for electric motors, it is known to provide correspondingly dimensioned apertures and projections in individual laminae so that an interlocking stack of laminae may be formed. U. S. patent 4,110,895 discloses such a laminated manufacture. U. S. patent 2,975,312 likewise discloses securing laminae together without separate fastening means. In addition, U. S. patent 4,110,895 patent teaches indexing each lamina prior to placing it in the stack of laminae. Such a practice is advantageous in minimizing the effects of any nonuniformity in the sheet metal stock from which the laminae are punched. U.S. patent 3,202,851 discloses a progressive die for forming and stacking interlockable laminae and includes a reference to art teaching rotation of rotor portions to achieve skew in the stack of laminations. Summary of the InventionAccording to the invention, each lamina is punched to provide, in addition to other features, nipples and correspondingly sized openings. A lamina punched from sheet stock at a blanking station is brought back into the stock. The stock is advanced to a working station having an alignment arbor and a clinching punch. The lamina is dislodged from the stock, forced onto the alignment arbor and compressed against laminae already on the arbor. The arbor is rotated for each lamina forced thereon to align the nipples and openings of adjacent laminae. A laminae support at the bottom of the arbor is lowered for each lamina forced onto the arbor.In this way a uniform, laminated stator structure is provided.Uniformity is present because the metalurgical irregularities in the sheet stock are uniformly dispersed in the stator structure as a result of the rotation. Any mechanical irregularities in planarity are likewise uniformly distributed throughout the stator structure. This results in better electromagnetic qualities in the stator structure and, therefore, better quality in the stepper motor using a stator assembled in accordance with this invention.A further advantage of this invention resides in the technique for interlocking laminae by a simple press fit. The stack is adequately held together for transport to any subsequent operations. The simple press fit of nipples into holes is thus more cost efficient than some methods in the prior art which required sufficient pressure to cause actual metal flow.As is recognized in the prior art, any technique which eliminates a need for rivets or separate clamping means is an improvement so that my simple press fit holds the stator structure in uniform alignment and no other clamping means are needed during subsequent operations such as wire wrapping or the like.Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein Brief Description of the DrawingsFig. 1 is a partial view of apparatus embodying the instant invention. Fig. 2 shows a laminated stator constructed in accordance with the present invention.Fig. 3 is an enlarged vertical section of a portion of the stator of Fig. 2 showing means for interlocking laminae in a stack. Description of a Preferred EmbodimentIn an exemplary embodiment of my invention as illustrated inFig. 1, a laminated dynamoelectric structure generally designated 10, may be formed to comprise the stator of a high speed stepper motor or the like. Each component lamina 14 of structure 10 is formed from a strip 16 of sheet metal stock in an improved apparatus 12 which includes a plurality of forming stations not shown and may be referred to as a progressive die.Structure 10 can be seen more clearly in Fig. 2. Each lamina 14 includes six pole piece portions 18 arranged about 600 apart. At the base of each pole piece 18 there is either an opening or hole 20 or correspondingly sized nipple or protrusion 22. Parts of these design characteristics are blanked into each lamina 14 as it progresses through various stations in progressive die apparatus 12 in a conventional manner.The penultimate station in apparatus 12 is a punch through station. A lamina 14, with its entire design blanked, is punched through from stock strip 16 by punch 24 against pressure pad 26 which is upwardly biased by spring 28 in die block 30. Spring loaded pressure pad 26 is provided for the purpose of returning a completed lamina 14 to stock strip 16 where lamina 14 is retained in a friction fit. In this manner stock strip 16 becomes a carrier for transporting a lamina 14 to the final station in progressive die apparatus 12.It is at this operating station that laminated stack structure 10 is constructed. Knock out clinch punch 32 is urged by spring 34 toward keyed arbor 36. Punch 32 is provided to punch a given lamina 14 through stock strip 16 and position it on stack structure 10. Stack 10 is supported about keyed arbor 36 by screw 38 which is movably mounted on keyed arbor 36 for rotation therewith.Means for rotating arbor 36 includes gear 40 which is driven by gear 42. Gear 42 is fixedly mounted on output shaft 44 of stepper motor 46. The gear ratio is such that each intermittent output of stepper motor 46 results in a 600 rotation of arbor 36 and therefore stack structure 10.The amount of rotation desired obviously is a function of the opening 20 and nipple 22 Fig. 2 spacing chosen In my exemplary embodiment, there are altogether six holes and nipples evenly spaced around a lamina 14. Thus 600 is chosen for rotation of arbor 36 between receipt of individual lamina 14. Accompanying this rotation is a lowering of support screw 38 by a distance equal in thickness to that of an individual lamina 14. Keyed arbor 36 is also operatively engaged with air cylinder 48 for facilitating operator removal of a completed stack structure 10. Sensor 50 is provided to detect the downstroke of punch 32. A signal indicative of detecting this position is fed to logic and control circuitry 52. Circuitry 52 is conventional and forms no part of this invention and may be implemented by those skilled in the art to perform the function I have indicated. Developed in circuitry 52 is a signal on line 54 to actuate stepper motor 46 for driving gear 42.Sensor 60 is provided to develop a signal indicative of a predetermined height being reached by laminated stack structure 10. In response to the signal developed by sensor 60 downward motion of punch 32 is stopped and air cylinder 48 is activated to completely lower arbor 36 enabling stack 10 to be removed from apparatus 12 by means not shown. Fig. 3 shows in cross section holes 20 and protrusions 22 formed in laminae 14 interlocked by a simple press fit accomplished by appropriately shaped clinch punch 32. The joints so formed are sufficiently resistant to separation to allow structure 10 to be handled and transferred to subsequent operating stations without danger of destruction. There is thus obtained a savings in cost in man and machine terms due to the elimination of separate intermediate clamping means.The improved apparatus operates as an addition to a progressive die with a plurality of operating stations at which any chosen design features are formed in sheet metal stack from which it is desired to make lamina to be assembled into dynamoelectric structures. In the preferred embodiment the invention is embodied in apparatus for manufacturing stators. Obviously the same features and advantages heretofore set out apply equally to the manufacture of rotor structures. Operation of the InventionReferring once again to Fig. 1, a brief description of the operation of my invention will be given. Sheet stock 16 has formed therein at various unshown, but conventional, stations in apparatus 12 design features chosen for a particular application. In this instance pole pieces, teeth, and interlockable holes 20 and projections 22 Fig. 2 are blanked for laminae 14. The sheet stock 16 is advanced to a position beneath punch 24 so that an individual lamina 14 is aligned properly therebeneath. An individual lamina is punched from, but returned to, sheet stock 16 by the combined action of punch 24 and spring biased pressure pad 26. Thus sheet stock 16 becomes a carrier for transporting the totally formed lamina 14 to the final station in apparatus 12. There, as earlier described, a lamina 14 is punched out from sheet stock 16 for the second time.Alignment arbor 36 receives lamina 14, and rotates a predetermined distance so that holes 20 and protrusions 22 of the first deposited lamina 14 will be in interlocking positions relative to the next received lamina. Rotation of arbor 36 also lowers arbor 36 by an amount substantially equal to lamina thickness. The punch, return, punch, stack, sequence is repeated until a predetermined height is attained by the laminae 14 as indicated by signals developed by appropriate sensors 50 and 60.At that point air cylinder 48 lowers a completely formed and interlocked stack of lamina a sufficient amount to allow removal thereof from the apparatus 12 by hand or other means.What has been shown and described is an efficient and less costly technique for manufacturing uniform laminated structure.The invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will, of course, be understood by those skilled in the dynamoelectric laminated structure art that various changes in form and detail may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.What is claimed is
