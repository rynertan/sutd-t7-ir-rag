## Description
MOSAIC DISPLAY PANEL The present invention pertains generally to mosaic display panels such as used, for example, as control panels in power processing and engineering industries. Control panel systems consist of horizontal and vertical mounting supports and of spring clamps from which is built a grid like supporting frame. From the front of this frame, is mounted a mosaic of tiles and control instruments, such as switches, pilot lamps, indicators or like instruments. At present, the vertical supports are spaced from one another a distance corresponding to the width of a tile or of a control instrument. Hence, each tile and each control instrument are mounted successively to two vertical supports. This is a time consuming operation especially in cases where a great number of blank tiles i.e. tiles which do not carry any information on the front face thereof is required for an important area of the display panel. Also, the mounting procedure is a costly operation since there are as many vertical supports as there are vertical lines of tiles in the grid. It is an object of the present invention to provide a mosaic display panel where the number of vertical supports is greatly reduced and also the assembly of a major part of the panel can be effected prior to be installed on the vertical supports. This is achieved by providing an intermediary mounting element between the vertical support and the tile or control instrument. Hence, a cluster of mounting elements can be interfittingly connected to form a tile or instrument supporting section of the panel which can then be mounted to two adjacent vertical supports. The present invention therefore relates to a mounting element adapted to a mosaic display panel which is formed of vertical and horizontal supports and of mosaic tiles and control instruments each mounting element is formed of side walls each including front, rear and side edges the rear edge has means engage able with the vertical supports while the front edge has means engageable with tiles and control instruments each side wall has an outer face displaying thereon a longitudinal projecting tab distanced from one of the side edges and a longitudinal guideway distanced from the other side edge the tab and the guideway are substantially complementary in shape so that the tab and guideway of said side wall may be respectively inter connected with the guideway and the tab of the side wall of an adjacently disposed mounting element whereby a cluster of mounting elements may be formed and mounted to two adjacent vertical supports. In an another form of the invention, the side walls further include means to prevent relative movement between the mounting elements once assembled. The invention is also concerned with a component which allows mounting a control instrument to a mounting element. Other objects, purposes and characteristic features of the present invention will be in part obvious from the accompanying drawings and in part pointed out as the description of the invention progresses. In describing the invention in detail, reference will be made to the accompanying drawings in which like reference characters designate corresponding parts throughout the several views. It should be understood, however, that this detailed description, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention is given by way of illustration only since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art.IN THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a perspective view showing part of a control panel made in accordance with the present invention Figure 2 is an exploded view showing the mounting element of the present invention together with the component adapted to mount a control instrument to the mounting element Figure 3 is a perspective exploded view showing a mounting element and a tile Figure 4 is a cross sectional elevational view of the component shown in Fig. 2 and Figure 5 shows another embodiment of a mounting element made in accordance with the present invention.DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown the components making up part of a control panel such as used for instance in a power processing company. Such panel consists of a front face 10 formed of a series of tiles of various sizes 12 and 13 which when assembled together hide and are supported by a grid like structure formed of a series of vertical supports 14 and horizontal supports 16. These tiles are made of a rigid plastic material and may be blank or displaying information data, such as lines, signs or other symbols. The supports 14 and 16 are usually mounted within a frame not shown or cubicle which may be fixedly attached to other frames or cubicles to form a large display area, such as found in power plant control rooms. Although not shown in the drawings, a control instrument may be mounted to the panel in place of a tile as described hereinbelow. An important feature of the present invention is that it is not necessary to have as many vertical supports as there are vertical rows of tiles. Indeed, as seen in Fig. 1, the vertical supports are longitudinally spaced from one another a distance corresponding to substantially four times the width of a tile 12.This feature is achieved in the present invention by providing between the vertical supports and the tiles or control instruments a mounting element 18, four of which are shown in Fig. 1 between two successive vertical supports 14. The horizontal supports 16 serve to maintain the vertical supports in place they include a plurality of square shape openings longitudinally spaced along the front edge thereof at a small distance therefrom. The vertical supports 14 have along the rear edge thereof a plurality of vertically spaced Tshaped slots 22 which are so dimensioned as to be engaged openings 20 of the horizontal supports. The front edge of each vertical support displays a series of vertically shape recesses 24, the function of which will be described hereinbelow. Each mounting element 18 consists of a rectangular hollow block having four identically shaped side walls 26. The outer face of each side wall displays a longitudinal projecting tab 28, dove tail shaped with a flat edge 30 and an inclined edge 32, the tab extending from the front edge 31 of the side wall to the rear edge 33 thereof at a small distance from the contiguous side wall. Each side wall also displays a rectangular guideway 34 which is defined by a flat edge 36 and an inclined edge 38, the opening extending also from the front edge 31 of the side wall to the rear edge 33 thereof at a small distance from the other contiguous side wall.The rear edge 33 of the side wall displays a small tab 42 having a shape corresponding to the shape of the recess 24 in the front edge of the vertical support so that the tab may tightly engage the vertical support, with the remaining portion of the rear edge abutting the front edge of the vertical support. The outer face of the side wall also includes, between tab 28 and guideway 34, a boss 44 of semi circular shape and a recess 46 also semi circular shaped and corresponding in length to that of the boss. The front edge 31 includes a recess 50 having a shape corresponding to the shape of the rear tab 42. The mounting element 18 is made of an injection molded plastic material, all four side walls being integrally mounted to another as a result of the rear inner peripheral portion 52 joining all side walls. Referring to Fig. 1, the mounting elements 18 may be interfittingly connected by having the dove tail tab 28 and guideway 34 of the side wall of one element slidably inserted into the similarly shaped tab and guideway of the side wall of an adjacent mounting element. To prevent any lateral movement between connected elements 18, the boss 44 of one mounted element is engagedly received in the recess 46 of the adjacent connected element 18. Once inter connected, elements 18 can receive a tile or a control instrument. In the case of a tile, the rear edge of each side wall includes a tab 54 which has a shape corresponding to the shape of recess 50 on the front edge 31 of the mounting element so that the tile may be tightly engaged to the connecting element.In the case where a control instrument is to be mounted to the control panel, an instrument component 56 seeFigs. 2 and 4 is used. Component 56 consists of a rectangular hollow body with a front peripheral frame portion 58, the rear edge of each side wall of which comprises a tab 60 of similar construction to that of tab 54 of tile 12 and to that of recess 50 on the front edge 31 of each side wall. The component 56 also includes a rearwardly extending body portion 62 of rectangular shape, which is to dimensioned as to be tightly engaged within the hollow body of the mounting element 18.One characteristic of this component 56 is that the upper and lower walls 64, 66 include a series of small slits 68 which define a plurality of resilient tongues 70, each having an inwardly projecting portion 72 which serves to apply pressure against the body of a control instrument when inserted into this component.The projecting portions 72 pivot outwardly as the instrument is inserted however, the resiliency in the material used preferably plastic for this component allows such pressure on the top and lower side of the instrument. Referring to Fig. 5, there is shown a variant of a mounting element 80 of. larger size than the above described mounting element 18 and which is shown connected to such mounting element 18 and to a similarly shaped connecting element 80 . Element 80 has a width twice that of element 18 and may be used for instance where an instrument of largo size than that referred to above is to be mounted to the panel. The two shortest walls have a construction similar to that of the side walls of mounting element 18.described above and will therefore not be repeated here. The other two side walls of larger width include two tabs 82 and two guideways 84 and, between these tabs and guideways, bosses and recesses, such as shown as 86 and 88 on the left hand side of the mounting element of Figure 5, are provided with an identical arrangement to those provided on mounting element 18 above. Of course, the instrument component adapted to be used with this mounting element 80 will have a shape to be fittingly engaged within said element. Although not described, it is evident that mounting elements of a size which is a multiple of the mounting element 18 may also be made for even larger instruments which may be mounted to a panel.
