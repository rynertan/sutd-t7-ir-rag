In general, a daily dosage consists of from about 5 to about 600 mg of active ingredient per kg. of body weight of the subject in one or more treatments per day. A preferred daily dosage for adult humans lies in the range of from about 10 to 240 mg. of active ingredient per kg. of body weight.Another factor influencing the precise dosage regimen, apart from the nature of the infection and peculiar identity of the individual being treated, is the molecular weight of the chosen species of this invention I .

The composition will generally contain from about 15 mg. to about 1500 mg. of the active ingredient however, in general, it is preferable to employ a dosage amount in the range of from about 250 mg to 1000 mg. In parenteral administration, the unit dosage is usually the pure compound I in sterile water solution or in the form of a soluble powder intended for solution. For zwitterionic species described under Structure I, the pH of such solutions typically will correspond to the zwitterionic point however, consideration of individual properties of solubility and stability may require such aqueous solutions to have a pH other than that of the zwitterionic point, for example in the range of 5.5 to 8.2. In the foregoing word description of the above schematic reaction diagram for the total synthesis of the defined carbapenem antibiotics, it is to be understood that there is considerable latitude in selection of precise reaction parameters.

In the following Table, the resulting compounds are taken from starting materials which are made available by the foregoing text and examples particularylTable II of Example 15. The column labelled Remarks and Reagents annotates the established procedure where necessary to obtain the indicated compound.In most instances the compounds are deblocked according to the procedure described in Example 12. However, when the SR8 side chain does not contain a basic function, the final product I is more conveniently isolated as the sodium salt M Na which result is facilitated by conducting the deblocking in a slight excess of NaHCO3. In any event, when either R6 or R7 bears a basic group, the final product I is most conveniently isolated as the free acid M H , rather than the sodium salt. It should be noted that compounds designated as free acids in reality are isolated as inner salts as a consequence of their zwitterionic nature. EMI88.1 Compound R6 R7 R8 Remarks, Reagents 1.
