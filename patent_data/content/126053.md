# A method for producing lead from sulphidic lead raw material.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for producing lead from sulphidic lead raw materials by direct smelting processes of the kind in which the lead raw materials are smelted autogenously in a shaft with the aid of oxygen gas, or air enriched in oxygen, optionally by adding fluxes, there being formed an oxide containing molten product which is caused to pass into a coke bed arranged in the lower part of the shaft, to form a lead phase and a slag depleted in lead. The invention is characterized by heating the coke bed continuously, by partially combusting carbon therein and or by supplying electrical energy thereto. The electrical heating is preferably effected by supplying electrical energy through induction or through electrodes. When heating the coke bed by the partial combustion of coke in the bed, oxygen gas or air enriched in oxygen is preferably introduced directly into the coke bed, through tuyeres or lances.
