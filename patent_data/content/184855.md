## Description
Technical Field This is a continuation in part of U.S. Patent Qpplication, Serial No. 681,516, filed December 14, 1985. The present invention relates to novel organic compounds which inhibit renin, processes for making such compounds, synthetic intermediates employed in these processes and methods of treating hypertension with such compounds. 8ackqround Srt Renin is a proteolytic enzyme synthesized and stored principally in a specific part of the kidney called the Juxtaglomerular apparatus. Nny of three different physiologic circumstances may cause the release of renin into the circulation a a decrease in the blood pressure entering or within the kidney itself b a decrease in the blood volume in the body or c a fall in the concentration of sodium in the distal tubules of the kidney. When renin is released into the blood from the kidney, the renin angiotensin system is activated, leading to vasoconstriction and conservation of sodium, both of which result in increased blood pressure. The renin acts on a circulating protein, angiotensinogen, to cleave out a fragment called angiotensin I AI . RI itself has only slight pharmacologic activity but, after additional cleavage by a second enzyme, angiotensin converting enzyme CE , forms the potent molecule angiotensin II AII .The major pharmacological effects of NII are vasoconstriction and stimulation of the adrenal cortex to release aldosterone, a hormone which causes sodium retention. flil is cleaved by an aminopeptidase to form angiotensin III AIII , which, compared to RII, is a less potent vasoconstrictor but a more potent inducer of aldosterone release. Inhibitors of renin have been sought as agents for control of hypertension and as diagnostic agents for identification of cases of hypertension due to renin excess. With these objectives in mind, the renin angiotension system has been modulated or manipulated, in the past, with flCE inhibitors. However,ACE acts on several substrates other than angiotensin I fly , most notably the kinins which cause such undesirable side effects as pain, leaky capillaries, prostaglandin release and a variety of behauioral and neurologic effects. Further, ACE inhibition leads to the accumulation of fit. Although RI has much less uasoconstrictor activity than fill, its presence may negate some of the hypotensive effects of the blockade of AII synthesis. Inhibition of other targets in the renin angiotensin system such as fill with compounds such as saralasin can block fill activity, but would leaue unimpaired and perhaps enhance the hypertensive effects of QIII. On the other hand, there are no known side effects which result when renin is inhibited from acting on its substrate. Considerable research efforts have thus been carried out to develop useful inhibitors of renin. Past research efforts have been directed to renin antibodies, pepstatin, phospholipids and substrate analogs such as tetrapeptides and octapeptides to tridecapeptides, These inhibitors either demonstrate poor activity in inhibiting renin production or poor specificity for inhibiting renin only. However, Boger et al. have reported that statine containing peptides possess potent and specific renin inhibiting activity Nature, Vol. 303, p. 81, 1983 .In addition, Szelke and co workers have described polypeptide analogs containing a non peptide link Nature, Vol. 299, p. 555, 1982 which also cause potent renin inhibition and show a high specificity for this enzyme. Euen with the discovery of such potent renin inhibitors, it has been observed that the more potent renin inhibitors have larger peptide chains but then poorer oral absorption. Conversely, the smaller peptide chain renin inhibiting compounds have shown good oral absorption, but are less potent. Accordingly, to date no renin inhibiting compounds have been found which are both orally active and potent.Disclosure of the Invention In accordance with the present invention, renin inhibiting compounds, which have been found to be both orally active and potent, have the formulaEMI3.1 wherein n is an N protecting group R1, R3 and R5 and R7 are loweralkyl or lipophilic or aromatic amino acid side chains and may be the same or different R2,R4, R6 are hydrogen or loweralkyl and may be the same or different X is hydrogen, loweralkyl or CH2OR8 wherein R8 is hydrogen, loweralkyl, or alkaryl and R9 is loweralkyl, hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, alkoxy, allyl, alkaryloxy or thioalkyl.

The novel compounds of the present invention possess an excellent degree of activity and specificity in treating renin associated hypertension in a host.The ability of the compounds of the invention to inhibit human renal renin can be demonstrated in vitro by reacting a selected compound at varied concentrations with human renal renin, free from acid proteolytic activity, and with human renin substrate angiotensinogen at 370C and pH 6.0. fit the end of the incubation, the amount of angiotensin I formed is measured by radioimmunoassay and the molar concentration required to cause 50 inhibition, expressed as the It50, is calculated. When tested in accordance with the foregoing procedure, the compounds of the invention demonstrated IC50 s in the range of 10 5 to 10 M as seen in Table I. Total daily dose administered to a host in single or divided doses may be in amounts, for example, from 0.001 to 10 mg kg body weight daily and more usually 0.01 to 1 mg. Dosage unit compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will uary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. The compounds of the present invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, rectally or topically in dosage unit formulations containing conventional nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles as desired.The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. Injectable preparation, for example1 sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3 butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and soluents that may be employed are water,Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a soluent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectibles. Suppositories fqr rectal administration of the drug can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable nonirritating excipient such as cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols which are solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefor melt in the rectum and release the drug. Solid dosage forms for oral administration may include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules.In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration may include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water.Such compositions may also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents.
