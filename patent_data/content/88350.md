Blend the smaller quantity of corn starch with the water and add the resulting corn starch paste, then mix until a uniform wet mass is formed. Add the remaining corn starch to the remaining wet mass and mix until uniform granules are obtained. Screen the granules through a suitable milling machine, using a 3 4 inch stainless steel screen. Dry the milled granules in a suitable drying oven until the desired moisture content is obtained. Mill the dried granules through a suitable milling machine using a 16 mesh stainless steel screen.Blend in the magnesium stearate and compress the resulting mixture into tablets of desired shape, thickness, hardness and disintegration.
