# ELECTRONIC FUEL INJECTION DEVICE FOR AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
The device comprises a control system 100 comman ded by sensing means consisting of at least one optic fibre transmitting a radiation to at least one radiation detector, said sensing means co operating with a rotating element driven by the engine, which consecutively intercepts the receipt of the radiation. The control system 100 determines the beginning and duration of injection at the injectors 11 incorporated in the fuel transfer circuit 10 , which circuit comprises two pipes, namely a fuel inlet pipe 19 and a fuel outlet pipe 20 which are interconnected and in heat exchange relation and are located at the back of each injector in order to obtain a closed transfer circuit and to ensure continuous circulation of fuel at the back of each injector, thus avoiding in line vaporization of said fuel.
