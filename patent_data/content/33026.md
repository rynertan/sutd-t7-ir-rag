# SLANT AXIS ROTARY PISTON MACHINE

## Abstract
A slant axis rotary piston machine includes a shaft 42 having an angularly offset eccentric 44 and a housing 10 defining a generally spherical chamber 22 journalling the shaft and containing the eccentric. A peripheral, generally sinuous partition 20 is fixed in the housing and extends radially into the chamber towards the eccentric. A rotor 62 is journalled on the eccentric and is of generally spherical exterior configuration 64 and has a peripheral groove 66, 68, 70 extending about and opening to its periphery. Each of the sides 66 and 68 of the groove face a corresponding side 24, 26 of the partition and define therewith at least two working volumes of variable volume. Gears 108, 110 sync hronize relative movement between the shaft, the rotor and the housing, and ports 90, 92, 94, 96 provide for ingress and egress of working fluid to the working volumes.
