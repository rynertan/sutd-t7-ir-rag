## Description
GAMMA PHASE MANGANESE ACTIVATED ZINC MAGNESIUM ORTHOPHOSPHATE CATHODE RAY PHOSPHOR AND MONITOR CATHODE RAY TUBE SCREEN EMPLOYING SAMEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a monitor cathode ray tube phosphor and screen, and more particularly relates to such a screen containing a long persistence, reddishorange emitting zinc magnesium orthophosphate phosphor. Monitor cathode ray tubes, used for example, in the static or dynamic display of computer input or output data, are typically operated at a frequency less than the 60 Hertz U.S. or 50 Hertz European of conventional cathode ray tube video displays. Such monitor displays are typically operated at 30 Hertz, enabling the handing of up to twice as much data for a given computer memory capacity as would be possible with conventional video displays. Such lower operating frequencies require the use of cathode ray phosphors having longer persistence in order to avoid flicker of the display, i.e., the appearance of a cyclic change in brightness corresponding to the frequency of operation. Such long persistence phosphors should also have good burn resistance i.e., capable of withstanding prolonged cathode ray excitation without degradation and chemical stability capable of withstanding wetting and drying during post fire phosphor processing and during cathode ray tube screen processing Manganese, arsenic activated zinc orthosilicate is a long persistence, green emitting CRT phosphor which has been widely used for monitor screens. There has been a lack of satisfactory long persistence CRT phosphors emitting in colors other than green. Furthermore, phosphors having even longer persistence than that of zinc orthosilicate could enable further reductions in the frequency of operation of the screens, and consequent further increases in efficiency of utilization of associated memory capacity. Zinc orthophosphate acivated by divalent manganese 2 has been known as a cathode ray phosphorZn3 PO4 2 Mn for some time. Substitutions of tin, barium and strontium were made to alter the excitation and emission characteristics. See U.S. patents 2,723,958 and 2,776,261, issued to F.N. Shaffer et al. in 1955 and 1957, respectively. The effect of magnesium substitution on crystal structure has also been studied. In Phase Equilibria In Zn3 P04 2 Mg3 Po4 2 , J. Electrochem. Soc., Vol. 106, No.ll, Nov., 1959, pp. 960 963, J. F. Sarver et al. showed that in the solid solution series betweenZn3 P04 2 and Mg3 P04 2, the Mg3 PO4 2 crystal structure gamma phase appeared at the substitution of about two mole percent of Mg for Zn, and was the only phase observed as Mg substitution increased from 5 to 100 mole percent p. 963 . Relative brightness of phosphors activated by 2 was highest at 5 to 10 mole percent Mg. In The Crystal Structure of and Luminescence of gamma Zinc Ortho Phosphate , J. hys. Chem. Solids, Vol.24, pp. 141 149, PergamonP ress, 1963, C. Calvo reported the existence of the gamma phase in Zn, Mg 3 PO4 2 for all compositions above thirty three mole percent Mg p.149 . In Cathodoluminescence of Zn Mg 3 P04 2 J. Electrochem. Soc., Vol. 127, No. 2, Feb., 1980, pp.503 505, W. Lehmann noted that the Mn activated zinc, magnesium orthophosphate cathode ray phosphor having equal mole percents of Zn and Mg and the gamma structure, exhibited long decay times.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention, a chemically stable bright, reddish orange emitting, long persistence cathode ray phosphor exhibiting the gamma phase magnesium orthophosphate crystal structure, has the molar formula Zn Mg Mny 3 z PO4 2 where x O to 0.20 y 0.01 to 0.04, and z 0.05 to 0.2. According to one aspect of the invention, the slight excess of total cations over the theoretical stoichiometric amount the excess represented by z , enables increased brightness of this mainly gamma phase cathode ray composition over stoichiometric compositions. According to a preferred embodiment, z 0.10 to 0.15, wherein cathode ray brightness of the phosphor is further optimized. According to another preferred embodiment, x is at least 0.03, the presence of Mg in such amounts stabilizing the gamma structure, thus enabling less critical control of firing temperature to form the phosphor. According to still another preferred embodiment, x is from 0.05 to 0.15 to insure that the composition is substantially completely gamma phase, regardless of firing temperature. Also in accordance with the invention, a monitor cathode ray tube screen comprises a faceplate and an array of elemental areas supported by the faceplate, the elemental areas comprising a photosensitive matrix material supporting cathode ray phosphor particles dispersed therein, at least some of which phosphor particles dre a composition of the invention.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING Figure 1 is a section view of a cathode ray tube faceplate 10 supporting a plurality of elemental areas 11, each area comprising a plurality of cathode ray tube phosphor particles including particles of the phosphor of this invention supported in a photosensitive matrix and Figure 2 is a graph of relative intensity of cathodoluminsecent emission versus time after excitation microseconds for several phosphor compositions including the phosphor of this invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring now to Figure 1, there is shown an article of manufacture, a monitor cathode ray tube screen including an array of elemental areas eg., dots, strips or stripes of a photosensitive matrix material, such as dichromated polyvinyl alcohol photoresist, supporting phosphor particles, the array supported by a screen substrate such as a cathode ray tube faceplate.Such elemental areas are preferably formed by exposing an integral photoresist layer selectively with a pattern of light corresponding to the pattern desired to be formed on the faceplate. Subsequently, a developer removes the unexposed portions of the photoresist including the phosphor particles supported therein, and leaves the areas which had been insolubilized to the developer by the light exposure. The screen may be monochrome, in which all areas in the array contain particles of the same phosphor or phosphor mixture, or may be polychrome, in which adjacent areas contain different phosphors or phosphor mixtures. An example of such a polychrome screen is a tri dot screen, analogous to the well known tri dot color screen for color television, in which the array comprises a repetitive pattern of adjacent red, blue and green dots. At least some of the phosphor particles utilized in such a monitor screen must exhibit long persistence, in addition to acceptable color and brightness of emission. Persistence must be sufficiently long to prevent undesirable flicker between cycles. Such a long persistence phosphor is the manganeseactivated zinc magnesium orthophosphate phosphor of this invention having the gamma phase crystal structure. As is known, depending upon the temperature of formation, the mainly zinc containing phosphors preferentially assume one of three crystal structures alpha phase low temperature, green emitting , gamma phase intermediate temperature, reddish orange emitting , and beta phase high temperature, red emitting . As magnesium is substituted for zinc, the gamma structure becomes preferred. Thus, at values of x O the starting material mixtures should be fired at a temperature within the range of about 890 C to 9100C in order to obtain mainly gamma phase, while at x values of at least 0.02, firing may range from about 970 C to 990 C. Compositions formulated at about stoichiometric total Zn plus Mn cations, or Zn plus Mg plus Mn cations, Where z equals 0.0 , to form on a fired basis the orthophosphate are not chemically stable in that they hydrolize to a weakly acid pH in water suspension to form, when wetted and then dried, the nonluminescent hydrated orthophosphate form. Similar compositions, except formulated at a slight excess over the theoretical stoichiometric cations required to form on fired basis the orthophosphate, z 0.05 hydrolize to a weakly basic pH in water and retain, when wetted and then dried during post fire phosphor processing and during cathode ray tube screen processing, the anhydrous orthophosphate form with close to the as fired catbodoluminescence brightness level.EXAMPLE I In one embodiment of the invention a longpersistence, reddish orange emitting, cathodoluminescent phosphor zinc orthophosphate with mainly gamma phase crystal structure was prepared having the following composition Zinc 3.05 gram atoms Manganese 0.05 gram atoms Phosphate P04 2.00 gram moles In making the phosphor the starting ingredients are combined and blended together in the following proportions Zinc Ammonium Phosphate 535.0 grams Zinc Oxide 128.2 grams Manganeous Carbonate 45.17 Mn 9.1 grams The above mixture is hammermilled and then blended to a homogeneous, finely divided powder form. It is then converted to the phosphor state by firing in an open quartz tray 10 inches long by 6 inches wide by 2 inches deep for 5 hours at 900 C in the ambient atmosphere of an electric glo bar furnace.When cool, the phosphor product may be post fire treated, if desired.EXAMPLE II In another embodiment of the invention, a magnesiummodified, long persistence, reddish orange emitting, cathodoluminescent zinc orthophosphate phosphor with gamma phase crystal structure is prepared having the following composition Zinc 2.80 gram atoms Magnesium 0.30 gram atoms Manganese 0.05 gram atoms Phosphate P04 2.00 gram moles In making the phosphor, the starting ingredients are combined and blended together in the following proportions Zinc Ammonium Phosphate 536.00 grams Zinc Oxide 97.65 grams Magnesium Oxide 18.15 grams Manganeous Carbonate 45.17 Mn 9.10 grams The above mixture is processed by the procedure ofExample I, except that firing was carried out at 9800C.
