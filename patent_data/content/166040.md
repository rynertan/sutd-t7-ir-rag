# Method of inoculating mushroom basidiospores, seed basidiospore bed for inoculation and boring apparatus for host wood for inoculation.

## Abstract
A method of inoculating basidospores of mushrooms particularly Lentinus edodes involves making a saw cut in the host wood to form a recess 1 and inserting therein a flat, half moon shaped seed basidospore bed 2 in a man ner so as to fill the recess. A seed basidospore bed for inoculation is made by incubation of the seed basidospore on a flat, half moon shaped piece of wood designed to conform to the shape of the host wood. A culture container A comprises a capped two part bottle like body suitable for incubation of seed basidospores and designed for compact storage. A boring apparatus for the host wood to be inoculated is designed to make many transverse cuts in the host wood efficiently by the use of plural circular saws 22 applied from various directions.
