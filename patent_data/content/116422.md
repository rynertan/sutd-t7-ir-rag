## Description
Liquid cleansing compositions This invention relates to multilayer liquid cleansing compositions in which one liquid phase is dispersible in another liquid phase upon shaking the composition and which on standing separate out into distinct layers. More particularly the invention relates to shampoo compositions for use on the body and hair. Multilayer cleansing compositions have been proposed in which one layer is miscible in all proportions with water whilst another layer being of an oily nature is immiscible with water. The oily layer may comprise paraffin oil, certain esters or silicone oils. Typically the lower layer comprises a water miscible layer including water as solvent and containing dissolved detergent whilst a water immiscible oil which phase floats on the aqueous phase. Examples of such compositions include bath shampoos which are added to bath water to afford body cleansing and which provide a film of oil which is retained on the skin upon emerging from the ba th to condition and or perfume the skin and hair shampoos where the oily layer serves to condition and or groom the hair.An Example of such a hair shampoo occurs in UnitedStates of America Specification No. 3810478 in which the upper layer relies for its integrity upon a major amount of a mineral toil. A7 d is adva nta ge of such oily materials in formulations is,,that they can leave an unsightly ring on the bath after use and in hair shampoos for use on naturally greasy heads are not necessarily a desirable component. United States Patent No. 4348292 described multilayer compositions for heavy duty cleaning in the form of a single dose concentrate for addition to water to provide a cleansing solution or dispersion. The concentrate has two aqueous layers, one layer containing at least one surfactant and the other layer containing at least one detergent builder. Preferred compositions were those in which the surfactant layer contains 50 90 by weight of surfactant and the detergent builder layer contains 30 80 by weight of detergent builder. These compositions are claimed to have enhanced cleansing efficacy as compared with homogeneous compositions, however, there is no guidance given on other than single dose presentations.In stepping from a single dose unit to a multidose unit problems can arise in ensuring a uniform fill of each phase into the container and more importantly, in the case of a shampoo composition in ensuring that the proper dose of each phase is dispensed from the container when in use. The specification of West German Patent ApplicationNo. 1617327 discloses a hair treatment composition containing 0.05 to 2.0 of certain metal polyphosphates of formula Mn 2PnO3n 1 wherein n is unspecified and M represents an alkali metal ion. Such compositions are intended to be applied to hair newly washed with soapless detergent, rinsed with water and squeeze dried and impart conditioning effects. The specification is emphatic that the treatment is conducted as a separate step and no further rinsing is to be carried out before drying, setting etc. Furthermore, the specificationvadvises that only ineffective amounts of the generically disclosed polyphosphates may be included into a hair shampoo formulation. A disadvantage of this disclosure is the necessity for a separate conditioner rinse step. During our investigations into shampoo compositions suitable for use by those persons desirous of frequent washing of their hair, compositions were developed which were two phase and which contained a variety of detergent b u i 1 d e r s. Most u n e x p e c t e dl y i t was found t h a t c om pos i t i o n s containing sodium hexa metaphosphate as the detergent builder exhibit conditioning effects on hair.Moreover such compositions may be used in a conventional manner, that is, simply applied to the wetted hair then worked up to a lather and rinsed out with a copious supply of clear water. Thus the feel and the manageability of hair so washed is improved. Accordi ngly the present invention provides a liquid shampoo composition having an upper aqueous layer and a lower aqueous layer, which are temporarily dispersible one in the other upon agitation and wherein each layer is miscible with water in substantially all proportions, said upper layer having dissolved therein at least one detergent and said lower layer containing sodium hexametaphosphate dissolved therein. Preferably, the dispersion resulting from the agitation of the layers is stable for sufficient time to allow uniform filling of the compositions into containers so that on standing the relative ratios of the phases within the co ntainers are constant. This avoids the problem of having to fill each container separately with predetermined amounts of two different concentrates. Desirably each of the upper and lower layers is substantially transparent. As will be discussed in detail later the relative ratios of the phases is dependent upon the nature and amounts of various components present. Sodium hexametaphosphate is the term applied to a mixture of condensed phosphates of the formula EMI4.1 in which the average value of n is about 12, that is a selection from the generic disclosure of West German specification No. 1617327 of the case that n 12. In the compositions the amount of sodium hexametaphosphate will normally be at least 6 by weight of the composition. Amounts of other detergent builder salts such as ammonium, sodium or potassium chlorides, sulphates, metaphosphates and or ortho phosphates may be included in the compositions. The total weight of the sodium hexametaphosphate plus other detergent builder salt s if present will normally comprise from 8 to 25 by weight of the composition and preferably 14 20g. The detergent may be an anionic, cationic, amphoteric or nonionic detergent or mixtures thereof. Preferably the compositions will include at least one anionic detergent. The concentration of detergent in the compositions of the present invention is generally similar to those in conventional shampoo compositions. Typical of the detergents that may be used are ammonium, substituted ammonium or sodium lauryl sulphates, or ethoxylated derivatives thereof containing up to 6 ethoxyl groups per mole substituted ammonium such as the tri and or diethanolamide salts of sulphated ethoxylated coconut monoethanolamide containing up to 6 ethoxyl groups per mole a olefin sulphates and alkyl aryl sulphonates of which the high foaming members are preferred imidazoline betaine or cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide. The concentration of these components is conveniently in the range 8 to 25 by weight based on the total composition, and preferably in the range 10 to 18 . In addition to the essential components mentioned above the compositions will normally include a foam boosting agent such as coconut diethanolamide and optionally a superfatting agent such as ethoxylated coconut monoethanolamide. The quantities of these two components can have an effect on the relative phase volumes and the viscosity of the compositions. The choice of detergent s in part controls the phase volume ratio of the final product. Thus, the chemical nature and the relative concentrations of the detergents employed influence the phase volume ratio. The phase volumes are also dependent upon the amount of the sodium hexametaphosphate and the amount and or nature of any additional detergent builder salt. For example when the detergent is an alkyl sulphate salt and is employed in a fixed concentration of active principle in a given detergent system, a certain phase volume ratio is attained. If the anion moiety of the surfactant is ethoxylated thereby to increase the solubility thereof with the same cation, the phase volume ratio is increased that is to say that relative volume of the lower layer increases. In the case, however, if for a particular unethoxylated anionic surfactant the nature of the cation is altered so to increase the water solubility of the surfactant then the phase volume ratio decreases that is to say the relative volume of the lower layer decreases and in the limit it tends to disappear resulting in a homogeneous mixture. This has been found for example in the series sodium alkyl sulphate ammonium alkyl sulphate diethanolamine alkyl sulphate triethanolamine alkyl sulphate in which series water solubility increases from start to finish. This is a basis for finely adjusting the phase volume ratio to a predetermined value. In order to effect an improved aesthetic appearance to the compositions one or more colouring materials may be included so that the different layers assume different colours or shades of colour to give the compositions a pleasing appearance. The compositions may also include medicaments such as coal tar or additional conditioning agents such as solubilised lanolin or hydrolysed proteins. The compositions may include special treatment materials which may be solids, semisolids or liquids to achieve special effects. For example an oily material or ester such as isopropyl myristate and the like may be included as a separate phase to form a multilayer product, or combined with one of the upper or lower layer phases if it is desired to produce a two layer product. A further feature of shampoo compositions in general is that the public has grown accustomed to a degree of thickness consequently compositions need to have controllable viscosity of an order that may be varied to taste. A preferred range is represented by the viscosity range 1000 3000 centipoise as measured with Brookfiel d viscometer RVT using No. 3 spindle at speed 20 at 200C.Clearly there may be considerable variations on both sides of this range to suit individual product requirements. The compositions may include a proportion of an alcohol such as iso proponal or ethanol in relatively low concentrations, of the order 2 w w of the total composition or less, for example to solubilise a treatment compound such as coal tar, or to solubilise a perfume. To safeguard against decomposition of components in the presence of heavy metal ions, a strong sequestering agent therefor may be incorporated without seriously disturbing the phase volume ratio. Suitable sequestering aids include ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid the aminomethylene phosphonates such as those manufactured byAlbright and Wilson under their trade mark BRIQUEST, for example acetoethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonic acid, and acetodiphosphonic acid trinitriloacetic acid and the like. The free acid may be added as such or it may be added in the form of an alkali metal salt. The amount of sequestering aid employed is of the order up to 1.00 w w of the total composition expressed as free acid, preferably about 0.5X w w. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples in which percentages are weight weight.
