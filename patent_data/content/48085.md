# Connector latching mechanism.

## Abstract
A latching mechanism is disclosed for use in combina tion with almost any known electrical connector. The subject latching mechanism is operable by one hand and needs access from only one end of the connector. Thus, the subject latching mechanism is suitable for use in high density arrays of connectors where there is access to only one end portion of the connector and yet latching on both ends is required. The latching mechanism includes a pair of first abutment studs 20, 22 on one connector member 12 , a pair of second abutment studs 24, 26 on the other connector member 10 , an actuating assembly 16 mounted on one end of one connector member 12 and a sliding latching member 18 mounted on one set of studs to engage the other set of studs.
