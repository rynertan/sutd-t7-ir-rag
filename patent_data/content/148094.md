# Anti tumor agent comprising an O benzylidene L ascorbic acid or a salt thereof, and the production of the latter compound.

## Abstract
A known compound, 5,6 O benzylidene L ascorbic acid and a new alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt thereof have now been found to exhibit anti tumor activity and be effective as anti tumor agent. 5,6 O benzylidene L ascorbic acid may efficiently be produced by a new process comprising reacting L ascorbic acid with alpha , alpha dimethoxytoluene in the presence of an acid catalyst such as p toluene sulfonic acid.
