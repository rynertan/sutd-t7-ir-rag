# Improvements in anti skid hydraulic braking systems for vehicles.

## Abstract
An anti skid hydraulic braking system incorporates a modulator assembly 3 for modulating the supply of fluid from a master cylinder 2 to a brake 1 in accordance with skid signals. The modulator assembly 3 comprises a de boost piston 9 located in a bore 8 in a housing 7 , an expander chamber 48 connected to the brake 1 , a first valve 14 between the master cylinder 2 and the chamber 48 , and a second valve 28 for controlling the application to the de boost piston 9 of a fluid sustained support force. The modulator assembly 3 incorporates a safety piston 42 which prevents the first valve 14 from closing unless means, suitably an hydraulic accumulator 4 or pump 5 , and which provides the fluid sustained support force are operative.
