## Description
APPARATUS FOR PHOTOSYNTHESISBackground of the Invention The present invention relates to an apparatus for effectively photosynthesizing photosynthetic substances such as algae typified by chlorella or spirolina, photosynthetic bacteria or artificial photosynthetic substances such as callus. Photosynthetic apparatuses heretofore proposed include an apparatus for culturing chlorella unicellular microorganism containing chlorophyl .Difficulty experienced in culturing chlorella is that illumination with intensities higher than a certain level destructs the chlorophyl and produces a toxin phaecphorbite while illumination with intensities lower than a certain level fails to cause photosynthesis altogether. It is therefore a primary requisite for effective photosynthesis that all the cells containing photosynthetic substances be supplied with constant light of an even distribution. Generally, organisms in a swarm increase not only their multiplying ability per unit volume but their resistance to other funge. The culturing efficiency, therefore, grows poor unless a predetermined light radiating area per one liter of culture medium is ensured. With this in view, it has been customary to promote the transmission of light by reducing the number of photosynthetic substances individuals .This involves an inconsistency, however, because an increase in the number of individuals lowersthe transmissibility to light and, therefore, requires collection of the individuals, but the resulting decrease in the number of individuals weakens the resistance to the funge.Another drawback hitherto encountered is that the light intensity is excessively high for the individuals near a light source but is insufficient for those remote from the light source and, additionally, the light is absorbed by water to have its wavelength component varied An ideal situation is, therefore, that photosynthetic substances be passed through a very narrow clearance while a predetermined intensity of light is directed perpendicular to the clearance.Then, sufficient light will be evenly applied to all the cells containing photosynthetic substances with a minimum of attenuation and without any change in its wavelength component A photosynthetic apparatus presently in use includes a number of fluorescent lamps arranged in a reaction bath e.g. chlorella culturing bath and causes photosynthetic substances to flow through the gaps between the lamps. However, the use of fluorescent lamps renders the apparatus bulky, increases power consumption and requires an awkward measure against heat generation by the lamps. Moreover, fluorescent lamps generally have peaks at specific wavelengths and those having a peak in their green component, which is harmful for chlorophyl, are unsuitable for photosynthesis. Apparently, sunlight or like natural light is most adequate for culturing chlorella and the like. In culturing chlorella, for example, one liter of culture medium extends over an area of 1 m2 when spread to a thickness of 1 mm. Meanwhile, when the culture medium is laid on a 1 m2 plane light source to a thickness of 1 mm, the intensity of the light source being assumed to be 1000 Qx, the intensity after the light has passed through the 1 mm thick culture medium is reduced to about 30 Qx in the case of a high density chlorella culture medium for enhancing the multiplying ability. Thus, hardly any light is allowed to reach chlorella located opposite to the plane light source.Although such problem may be solved if plane light sources are located at both sides of the 1 mm thick culture medium, such results in generation of a significant amount of heat when the light sources comprise fluorescent lamps, as has been the case with conventional apparatuses.Summary of the Invention An apparatus for photosynthesis embodying the present invention comprises a photosynthetic reaction bath. A plurality of photoradiators are arranged in the reaction bath to radiate light and each of these photoradiators has a narrow tubular configuration and is spaced from the adjacent photoradiators by a distance which is not more than about 2 mm. In accordance with the present invention, an apparatus for photosynthesis has a reaction bath in which a plurality of narrow tubular photoradiators are arranged to radiate light and spaced from each other by a distance which is not more than about 2 mm.Each photoradiator has a cross section which is cylindrical, equilateral triangular, tetragonal or hexagonal. It is an object of the present invention to provide a new apparatus for photosynthesis which effectively promotes photosynthesis. It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for photosynthesis which eliminates the need for a measure against heat generation by a light source. It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for photosynthesis which can be readily scaled up as desired. It is another object of the present invention to provide a generally improved apparatus for photosynthesis. Other objects, together with the foregoing, are attained in the embodiments described in the following description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings.Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 is a fragmentary enlarged cross section of a photosynthetic apparatus embodying the present invention Fig. 2 is a view of a photoradiator applicable to the apparatus shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a fragmentary enlarged cross section of another embodiment of the present invention Fig 4 is a view of a photoradiator applicable to the apparatus shown in Fig. 3 Fig. 5 is a section along line V V of Fig. 4 Fig. 6 is a fragmentary enlarged cross section of another embodiment of the present invention Fig. 7 is a view of a photoradiator applicable to the apparatus shown in Fig. 6 Fig. 8 is a section along line VIII VIII of Fig.7 Fig. 9 is a fragmentary enlarged cross section of still another embodiment of the present invention Fig. 10 is a view of a photoradiator applicable to the apparatus shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 11 is a section along line XI XI of Fig. 10.Description of the Preferred Embodiments While the apparatus for photosynthesis of the present invention is susceptible of numerous physical embodiments, depending upon the environment and requirements of use, substantial numbers of the herein shown and described embodiments have been made, tested and used, and all have performed in an eminently satisfactory manner. Referring to Fig. 1 of the drawings, a photosynthetic reaction bath in accordance with the present invention is shown and generally designated by the reference numeral 10. A number of photoradiators 12 are disposed in the reaction bath 10 at regular spacings d1. Each photoradiator 12 has a radius of r1 cm. Suppose that arbitrarily selected adjacent three of the photoradiators 12 have centers A, B and C as illustrated. Then, the triangle P1 ABC has an area which is expressed as 2x1 d1 ê cos30 x1 2 Eq. 1 The sectors Aaa Bbb Ccc have an area S2 which is given by r1êx1 6 x3 r1êx1 2 Eq. 2 The area S3 defined by ab bc ca is obtained as S1 S2 1 2 2r1 d1 cos30 r1ê Eq. 3 Further, the arcs aa bb cc have a total length g which is 3 g r1 x 6 Eq. 4 Assuming that each photoradiator 12 has a lengthH1 see Fig. 2 , then the volume of culture medium W1 allowed to flow through the area S3 is expressed as H1 W1 H1 x S3 2 2r1 d1 ê cos r1ê Eq. 5 The above mentioned amount of culture medium W1 contacts the photoradiators 12 over an area S which is S H1 x g H1sr1 Eq. 6 Hence, the contact area per unit culture medium, S W1, is given by EMI6.1 With respect to various values of the radius r1 of the photoradiators 12 and distance d1 between the adjacent photoradiators 12, the factors S, W1 and S W1 were obtained as indicated in Table 1 shown below. Table 1 cm cm cm cmê cm mê l d1 r1 H1 S W1 S W1 0 0.5 30 47.12 1.209 3.896 1.0 30 94.25 4.838 1.948 2.0 30 188.50 19.351 0.974 0.05 0.5 30 47.12 2.541 1.855 1.0 30 94.25 7.468 1.262 2.0 30 188.50 24.58 0.767 0.1 0.5 30 47.12 3.937 num 1.1969 1.0 30 94.25 10.16 0.9273 2.0 30 188.50 29.87 0.6310 0.2 0.5 30 47.12 6.925 0.6805 1.0 30 94.25 15.75 0.5984 2.0 30 188.50 40.65 0.464 0.3 0.5 30 47.12 10.17 0.4633 1.0 30 94.25 21.60 0.4364 2.0 30 188.50 51.70 0.3646 It will be seen from Table 1 that the condition m L 2 1 previously discussed is satisfied by five different ratios S1W1 as indicated by marks and to num . However, the spacing d1 which is zero is impractical because it allows no culture medium to be recirculated, while 0.5 mm of spacing d1 is difficult to be accurately defined during manufacture. Thus, a ratio siw1 which can be put to practical use is the one marked num inTable 1 provided by the spacing d1 of 1 mm and the diameter of 10 mm. Concerning the spacing d1, it will be noted that about 1.2 mm at the maximum is allowable in view of the fact that bubbling is usually caused by carbon dioxide in the culture medium. To promote continuous operation, the reaction bath 10 may be provided with a hermetically sealed structure which avoids contamination to the culture medium, evaporation of water, etc.The number of photoradiators 12 can readily be increased while satisfying the condition m2 IL 1, promoting the ease of scale up of the apparatus. For the triangular photoradiators 12, the reaction bath may have a triangular, square, hexagonal or circular crosssection. Referring to Fig. 2, a preferred example of the photoradiators 12 applicable to the apparatus shown inFig. 1 is illustrated. The photoradiator 12 includes a light transmitting cable generally designated by the reference numeral 14. The cable 14 comprises a clad layer 14a, a core 14b, and a number of light diffusing members 16 each adhered to the core 14b. The assembly is hermetically edcapsulated in a transparent casing 18.The solar rays are collected by an apparatus, not shown, and conducted through the cable 14. The light rays reached the interior of the casing 18 are diffused by the diffusers 16 to the outside into the reaction bath 10 via the transparent casing 18. In the illustrated embodiment, such photoradiators 12 are arranged regularly in the reaction bath 10 so as to achieve the operation and effect previously discussed. Referring to Fig. 3, another embodiment of the photosynthetic apparatus of the present invention is shown. The apparatus comprises a photosynthetic reaction bath 30 in which a number of photoradiators 32 are arranged in neat order at a common spacing d2.Each photoradiator 32 has an equilateral triangular cross section and a radius of r2 cm one side being dimensioned r2 x cos 300 . As in the first embodiment, arbitrarily selected adjacent six of the photoradiators 32 are assumed to have centers 0 which define a hexagon P2. Then, the total area hatched in Fig. 3 S4 of the spacings or gaps within the hexagon P2 is expressed as Sq 6 cos 300 3d 2 cos 300 S4 6d 2 3 d2 cos 30 2r2 d2 Eq. 8 Supposing that the length H2 of each photoradiator 32 is 30 cm, the volume W2 of the culture medium allowed into the total gap is given by W2 H2 X S4 30 x 3 d2 cos 300 2r2 d2 90 x d2 cos 300 2r2 d2 Eq. 9 Meanwhile, the photoradiators 32 contact the culture medium over an area S which is S H2 x 12 x r2cos 300 360 r2cos 300 Eq. 10 The various values indicated in Table 2 were obtained with respect to parameters which were the radius r2 of each photoradiator 32 and the distance d2 between the adjacent photoradiators 32.

Again, the culture medium is usually caused to bubble by carbon dioxide and this permits the distance d2 to become somewhat longer than the upper limit mentioned, i.e. up to about 2 mm in practice. Thus, in this embodiment, photosynthesis can effectively occur without being effected by the size of the photoradiators 32 only if the gap d2 between the photoradiators 32 is maintained not more than about 2 mm. It is possible, therefore, to use photoradiators of various sizes in combination. For example, some of the photoradiators 32 may comprise fluorescent lamps to emit artificial light while the rest may comprise photoradiators of a relatively small diameter to emit natural light from optical fibers. With this combination, photosynthesis will occur during daytime taking advantage of the sunlight and, during nighttime or the like, aided by the fluorescent lamps. Furthermore, because the photoradiators using optical fibers are capable of guiding sunlight natural light or artificial light emitted from a fluorescent lamp or xenon lamp as desired, various combinations of sunlight and artificial light are available such as introducing sunlight during daytime and artificial light during niChttime or introducing sunlight into some of the photoradiators and artificial light into the rest. Due to the triangular cross section, the photoradiators 32 can be arranged effectively in the reaction bath 30 if the reaction bath is provided with a triangular, square or hexagonal contour.Again, the reaction bath 30 can operate continuously without contamination to the culture medium or evaporation of water if provided with a hermetically sealed structure.The number of the photoradiators 32 can be readily increased under the condition concerned, i.e., mê l 1, facilitating the scale up of the apparatus. Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate an example of the photoradiators 32 which is suitable for emitting natural light for photosynthesis. In these drawings, the same elements as those shown in Fig. 2 are designated by like reference numerals. Referring to Fig. 6, another embodiment of the present invention is shown which comprises a photosynthetic reaction bath 60. A number of photoradiators 62 are arranged in the reaction bath 60 at regular spacings of d3. Each photoradiator 62 has a square cross section with a radius of r3 cm one side being dimensioned r3 x cos 450 . Let it be supposed that arbitrarily selected four adjacent photoradiators 62 have centers 0 which define a square P3. Then, the total area hatched inFig. 6 S5 of the gaps between the photoradiators 62 within the square P3 is expressed as S5 r3 cos 450 x d3 x 4 d32 d3 d3 4r3 cos 450 Eq. 11 Where the length H3 of the photoradiators 62 is 30 cm for example, the volume W3 of the culture medium which the gaps can accommodate is given by W3 H2 xS5 d3 d3 4r3 cos 450 Eq. 12 Meanwhile, the area S over which the light emitting surfaces of the photoradiators 62 contact the culture medium is obtained as S 2r3 cos 450 x 4 x H3 8r3 cos 450 x H3 Eq. 13 The factors S , W3 and S W3 obtained with respect to various values of the radius r3 of the photoradiators 62 and their gaps d3 are indicated inTable 3.

It will be seen from Table 2 that the ratio S IW3 substantially depends upon the distance d3 and is hardly effected by the diameter r3 of the photoradiators 62. Again, the culture medium is usually caused to bubble by carbon dioxide and this permits the distance d2 to become somewhat larger than the upper limit mentioned, i.e. up to about 2 mm in practice. For the square photoradiators 62, the reaction bath may have a square or circular crosssection. Figs. 7 and 8 illustrate an example of the photoradiators 62 which is suitable for guiding and emitting natural light in connection with the embodiment shown in Fig. 6. In these drawings, the same elements as those shown in Fig. 2 are designated by the same reference numerals. Referring to Fig. 9, still another embodiment of the present invention is shown which comprises a photosynthetic reaction bath 90. Arranged regularly inside the reaction bath 90 are a number of photoradiators 92.Each of these photoradiators 92 has a hexagonal crosssection one side radius of which is r3 cm long and is spaced d3 from the adjacent photoradiators 92. As in the foregoing embodiments, arbitrarily selected three of the photoradiators 92 have centersD, E and F, respectively. Lines DE, EF and FA interconnecting the centers D, E and F are assumed to intersect the light radiating surfaces of the photoradiators 92 at points d, e , e, fw, f and d . Further, the segments bisecting the interior angles of the triangle P4 DEF are assumed to intersect the light emitting surfaces of the photoradiators 92 at points d , e and f .Then, the area S6 of the triangle d f e is expressed as 2 S6 S4cos30 3r2 Eq. 14 The area S7 of the tetragons dd e e ee f f ff d d is given by S7 1 2r4d4x3 Eq. 15 The area S8 of the gaps between the photoradiators 92 within the triangle P4 is obtained as S6 S7 1 2 d4êcos30 3r4d4 Eq. 16 Supposing that each photoradiator 92 is H4 long, the volume W4 of the culture medium filling the gaps between the photoradiators 92 is expressed as b4 S8H4 1 2 d4êcos30 3r4d4 H4 Eq. 17 The area S over which the light emitting surfaces of the photoradiators 92 contact the culture medium is provided as S 3 r4H4 Eq. 18 The values S , W4 and S W4 obtained with respect to various values of the distance d4 between the photoradiators 92 and length of one side r4 radius of each photoradiator are shown in Table 4.

For the hexagonal photoradiators 92, the reaction bath may have a hexagonal or circular cross section. Figs. 11 and 12 illustrate an example of the photoradiators 92 suitable for emitting natural light in connection with the embodiment shown in Fig. 9. In these drawings, the same elements as those shown in Fig. 2 are designated by like reference numerals. In summary, it will be seen that the present invention provides a photosynthetic apparatus which can be effectively operated and readily scaled up due to the effective arrangement of photoradiators.Furthermore, the apparatus of the invention does not use any light source which contains a heat source such as a fluorescent lamp, thereby precluding the need for a measure against heat generation. Various modifications will become possible for those skilled in the art after receiving the teachings of the present disclosure without departing from the scope thereof.
