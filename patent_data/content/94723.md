# Method for washing of textiles in hard water and phosphate free detergent compositions for use therein.

## Abstract
A method is provided for washing of textiles in hard water under substantial exclusion of phosphates by com bined use of an inorganic salt derived from carbondioxide, an acidic compound not causing precipitation with the calcium and magnesium ions in the washing liquor at usual dosage, and a surface active agent not causing precipitation either under these conditions, maintaining the pH within the range of 5 to 8, and the temperature at at most 70 C. Also a detergent composition comprising the above mentioned components in such a ratio that the pH of a 0.5 by weight solution in a washing liquor is within the range of 5 to 8.
