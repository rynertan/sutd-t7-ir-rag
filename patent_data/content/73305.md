# An expander for magnetic bubble devices.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a side feed expander for mag netic bubble devices. The side feed expander includes a plurality of rows 29, 30 of expander elements 28 , and an input propagation element 22 associated with one of the sides of expander element 28 in the row 29 of expander elements. In a preferred embodiment, the input element is associated with the apex portion 26 on one side of the expander element 28 . In another embodiment one input propagation element is associated with the side of an ex pander element on one end of the row of the expander and a second input propagation element is associated with the side of an expander element positioned on the other end of the row. A side expander permits a dummy sensor 16 to be positioned in several positions, including the opposite end of the expander from where an active sensor 14 is located.
