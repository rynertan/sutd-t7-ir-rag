## Description
A POWER SOURCE FOR A WIRE CUT ELECTRIC DISCHARGE MACHINE, AND SUCH A MACHINE INCLUDING THE POWER SOURCE. The present invention relates to a power source for a wire cut electric discharge machine, and such a machine including the power source. In general , voltage fluctuation between a wire electrode and a workpiece in a wire cut electric discharge machine causes variation in machining characteristics. To retain a desired machining characteristic, it is necessary to stabilize the power source for machining, but in this case, if the power source cannot respond sufficiently well to load variations in the discharging part of the wire cut electric discharge machine, an accident such as the breakage of the wire or the like can occur.When the workpiece is short circuited with the wire, it has been general practice to immediately cut off a current flowing across the wire and the workpiece, in order to repair the short circuit, and then to apply a current across them for re starting machining operation, but in such a case, if the response of the power source is not sufficient, the power source voltage may rise temporarily due to the cutting off of the current and the machining operation can be resumed under such a high voltage condition, resulting in the wire electrode being readily broken. According to the present invention there is provided a power source, for a wire cut electric discharge machine in which a voltage is applied across a wire electrode and a workpiece to machine the latter by an electric discharge, characterised by a comparator for comparing power source voltage with a reference voltage, for detecting when the power source voltage rises higher than a predetermined voltage value, and a switching element connected via a resistance across the power source and arranged so as to become conductive when the comparator detects that the power source voltage is higher than the predetermined voltage value. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a power source suitable for use with a wirecut electric discharge machine. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a power source for a wire cut electric discharge machine which has improved responsivity, to avoid breakage of a wire electrode when re starting machining between a wire electrode and a workpiece. The power source is adapted to prevent breakage of a wire electrode which might otherwise be caused when re starting machining of a workpiece in a state in which the power source voltage is higher than a predetermined voltage. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a power source for a wire cut electric discharge machine which permits smooth electric discharge machining. Briefly, a power source embodying the present invention, for use with a wire cut electric discharge machine, includes a comparator for comparing power source voltage with a reference voltage to detect an increase in the power source voltage in excess of a predetermined value, and one or more transistors, or like switching elements, each connected in parallel with the power source via resistor. The switching element or elements operate on the detected output from the comparator to connect the resistors in parallel to the power source, whereby the power source voltage, if raised to a high level, drops immediately or rapidly, thus preventing breakage of the wire when the machining operation is resumed. Reference is made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is an electric circuit diagram illustrating principal parts of an embodiment of the present invention Fig. 2 is a circuit diagram of an example of a control circuit for controlling the ON OFF operation of a switching element Q1 of Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 comprises waveform diagrams illustrating load current I and power source voltage V5 during the operation of the circuit depicted in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1 WIR is a wire electrode, WK is a workpiece, T1 is a power source terminal to which is connected a DC power source for providing a voltage V5, Q1 is a transistor or like switching element for discharge control use, T2 is an input terminal to which control pulses P are applied, C1 and C2 are capacitors,R1 to R7 are resistors, T3 is an input terminal to which a reference voltage V is applied, COMP1 is a comparator, and Q2 is a switching element such as a transistor or the like.A power source not shown and the discharge control switching element Q1 are connected in series with the wire electrode WIR and the workpiece IYK, and the switching element Q1 is repeatedly turned ON and OFF by the control pulsesP, charging the capacitor C2 via the resistor R1 from charges stored in the capacitor C1 with a polarity , as indicated in Fig. 1. Charging voltage is applied across the wire electrode WIR and the workpiece WK and discharge current from the capacitor C2 flows as a discharge into the air gap defined between the wire electrode WIR and the workpiece WK, thus performing electric discharge machining. The power source circuit is arranged so that a load current supplied across the wire electrode WIR and the workpiece WK is temporarily cut off by a control circuit not shown during short circuiting of the wire electrode WIR and the workpiece WK. Such an arrangement is well known in the art and an example of the arrangement is shown in Figure 2, in which the switching element Q1, the capacitor C1, the workpieceWK and the wire electrode WIR are the same as those shown in Figure 1. In Figure 2, R8 to R11 are resistors, COMP2 is a comparator, G is an AND circuit,OSC is a control pulse oscillator, and T4 is a terminal to which a reference voltage Vg is applied. The switching element Q1 is normally turned ON and OFF repeatedly by control pulses applied via theAND circuit G from the control pulse oscillator OSC.When the wire electrode WIR and the workpiece WK are short circuited, a voltage across the machining gap between them rapidly drops, and the short circuiting is detected by the comparator COMP2 for comparing the voltage across the machining gap with the reference voltage V0 and the detection output of the comparator is provided to the AND circuit G to close it. As a consequence, the supply of the control pulses P is interrupted and the switching element Q1 is held in the OFF state, cutting off the load current I supplied across the wire WIR and the workpiece WK. In Figure 1, the voltage V5 supplied from the power source is divided by the resistors R2 and R3 connected across the power source terminal T1, and the voltÅage divided output is applied via the resistor R6 to one input terminal of the comparator COMP1, which is supplied at its other input terminal with the reference voltage V. In the comparatorCOMP1, the voltage divided value of the voltage V5 and the reference voltage V are compared, and when the former is larger than the latter, the switching element Q2 is turned ON by the detection output from the comparator COMP1.Since the switching element Q2 is connected across the power source terminal T1 via the resistor R4, when the switching element Q2 conducts, the voltage Vs is rapidly reduced by the resistor R4. For example, in the case where the load currentI supplied across the wire electrode WIR and the workpieceWK is cut off at a moment tl see Figure 3 because of short circuiting, the voltage Vs rises sharply in the prior art, as indicated by the broken line A inFigure 3. In this state, if the load current I is applied at a moment t2 to re start machining, the wire electrode WIR may be broken, as mentioned previously.In the present embodiment of this invention, however, the rise of the voltage V5 is detected by the comparator COMP1 and the switching element Q2 is turned ON, so that the voltage V5 rapidly drops, as indicated by the solid line B in Figure 2, and is stable at a predetermined voltage level when machining is re started This ensures prevention of wire electrode breakage at the re starting of machining. As has been described in the foregoing, according to the present invention, when an increase in the power source voltage is detected, a switching element connected in parallel with the power source via a resistor is made conductive thereby to rapidly reduce the increased voltage, by which it is possible to prevent problems such as breakage of a wire electrode when re starting machining, thus ensuring smooth electric discharge machining. It will be apparent that many modifications and variations may be effected without departing from the scope of the novel concepts of the present invention.
