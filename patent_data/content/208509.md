## Description
The present invention relates to baked products having shelf stable texture, to dough preforms for making such products, and to methods of making such products. US Patents 4,455,333 and 4,503,080 disclose baked products and, in particular, cookies which purport to be crumb continuous following the baking thereof. Both US Patents state that the standard of excellence in cookies is fresh, home baked cookies and that the dominant characteristic of most of these fresh, home baked cookies is their texture, specifically, a crisp friable outside surface and a ductile, chewy interior. However, both US Patents observe that such duality of textures in fresh home baked cookies is lost as time progresses and, during the first 1 6 days after baking, the moisture equilibriates throughout the cookie, such that the once fresh home baked cookies attain a relatively uniform harder texture throughout. Both US Patents suggest that ready to serve cookies may be formulated so as to manipulate sugar crystallization to emulate the multiple textural characteristics of the fresh home baked cookies and that the multiple textures in these sugar crystallization manipulated cookies are shelf stable for periods of time which substantially exceed that 1 6 days of home baked cookies. US Patent 4,455,333 suggests that the manipulation of sugar crystallization may be accomplished through the utilization of two different doughs in the cookie. One dough, i.e. the dough which is to remain more ductile and soft, contains high percentages of crystallization resistant sugars, e.g. fructose and dextrose. The other dough which is to remain relatively crisp and friable depends upon the presence of high percentages of a readily crystallizable sugar, i.e. sucrose, to produce the crisp texture desired. US A 4503080 suggests that readily crystallizable sugars, i.e. sucrose, may be employed in both of the doughs. Again, the crisp dough portion is stated to depend upon the crystallization of that sucrose. The dough portion which is intended to remain relatively chewy and ductile utilizes a crystallization inhibitor to retard or prevent the crystallization of the sucrose in that dough to achieve this soft and ductile texture. This patent discloses that a variety of such crystallization inhibitors may be employed, including starch hydrolysates, to produce the shelf stable, ductile chewy texture of that portion upon baking. US A 4250202 discloses the replacement of sucrose in cakes by a blend of high fructose corn syrup and corn syrup having a dextrose equivalent D.E. of 42. GB A 1517158 discloses a baked goods premix of water, fat and 5 to 25 , based upon the fat and flour, of a 1 to 40 D.E. polysaccharide which is said to improve the handling properties of a dough made from the premix. According to the present invention there is provided a baked food product containing dough ingredients and a starch hydrolysate having a D.E. of 42 or less, characterised in that it is baked to a water activity level in the range 0.25 to 0.8 and the amount of starch hydrolysate it contains is in the range of 2 to 30 by weight of the unbaked dough and is effective to impart to the baked product a crisp, shelf stable texture which is substantially harder than that of an equivalent product containing no starch hydrolysate. The present invention also provides a baked food product containing dough ingredients and a starch hydrolysate having a D.E. of 42 or less, characterised in that it is baked to a water activity in the range 0.25 to 0.8 and comprises at least two crumb continuous regions which differ in texture from each other, one of the regions comprising a baked dough having a soft and chewy texture and the other region comprising a baked dough which includes the starch hydrolysate in an amount which is in the range of 2 to 30 by weight of the unbaked dough and is effective to impart a crisp, substantially harder texture to the other region than the soft and chewy texture of the one region, the soft and chewy and harder textures being shelf stable. Further, the invention provides a dough preform comprising dough ingredients and a starch hydrolysate having a D.E. of 42 or less, characterised in that it is laminated and comprises In another aspect, the invention provides a method of preparing a baked dough product preform comprising dough ingredients and a starch hydrolysate having a D.E. of 42 or less, characterised by The starch hydrolysates preferably have a D.E. of about 20 or less and preferably comprise at least 8 percent by weight of the dough, before baking. Preferably, the starch hydrolysates comprise about 14 20 percent by weight of the dough before baking and preferably have a D.E. of about 10 20. The dough which contains the starch hydrolysates may also include sucrose or a reducing sugar in addition to any sugars which may be present in the starch hydrolysates, but sucrose may be absent from the dough containing the starch hydrolysate. Where the products of the invention are to exhibit multiple textures following baking, the layers or regions which exhibit the soft and chewy texture may include a reducing sugar in an amount such that, when baked, these layers or regions have a shelf stable, soft and chewy texture. Also when the products are to be exhibit multiple textures following baking, those textures are preferably present when the product is baked to an intermediate water activity level. The present invention contrasts with the suggestions of US A 4503080 in that certain starch hydrolysates in certain effective amounts, and whether in the absence or presence of sugars, have the capability themselves of imparting exactly the opposite characteristics to doughs when baked. More specifically, in the present invention, certain starch hydrolysates impart a wide range of desirable qualities of hardness, rather than softness, to the baked product depending upon the kinds and amounts of starch hydrolysates used. The starch hydrolysates of the present invention may be employed either alone or in combination with other sugars or mixtures thereof, for example either readily crystallizable sucrose or non readily crystallizable reducing sugars, such as fructose or dextrose, to adjust and control the enhanced textural hardening effects desired. The utilization of the starch hydrolysates in the present invention to adjust and control the hardness textural qualities in baked products provides a number of substantial advantages over the sugar crystallization manipulation mechanisms discussed in US A 4455333 and US A 4503080. One substantial advantage is that the kinds and amounts of starch hydrolysates of the present invention may be selected so as to accurately tailor the textural characteristics of the baked product generally independently of sugar crystallization. Thus, by utilizing starch hydrolysates for the adjustment and control of the textural characteristics of the baked product, the degree of sweetness may also be readily controlled within wide limits and substantially independently of textural considerations. Indeed, sugars may be actually essentially eliminated from the starch hydrolysate texture controlled dough of the present invention and the texture of that dough may be adjusted and controlled solely by the starch hydrolysates. Thus, caloric intake may be reduced, as well as sweetness. On the contrary, sweetness control is difficult in the mechanisms employing sugar crystallization manipulation because, by definition, the latter necessitates the use of substantial quantities of sugars in the doughs to achieve the desired textural results, thereby resulting in high sweetness and caloric levels. However, if additional sweetness is desired in the starch hydrolysate texture controlled doughs of the present invention, either readily crystallizable sugars, non readily crystallizable reducing sugars or mixtures thereof which may be otherwise typically employed in sweetened baked products may be added because the starch hydrolysates of the invention are compatible with all of those sugars. Still another advantage of the present invention is that the starch hydrolysates which may be employed are readily available and inexpensive, and have been widely accepted for food usage. Still another significant advantage of the present invention is that the textural characteristics of cookies using starch hydrolysates in accordance with the present invention to adjust and control texture are capable of even more precise adjustment and control of the texture than are cookies which rely merely upon the adjustment of texture by sugar crystallization manipulation. Thus, cookies made in accordance with the present invention are capable of even closer emulation of the fresh, home baked cookies of the kind which the above mentioned U.S. Patents state are the standard of excellence in the cookie world. Still another advantage of utilizing starch hydrolysates for the adjustment and control of the texture of the baked products in accordance with the present invention is that the baked products attain textural equilibrium within a matter of hours after baking, e.g. 24 hours, as opposed to weeks in the baked products which rely upon the manipulation of sugar crystallization to control texture as in the above mentioned U.S. Patents. Thus, holding the products for substantial periods of time to enable them to attain textural equilibrium is unnecessary with the products of the present invention. Not only do these products attain rapid textural equilibrium, but these textures remain shelf stable for months, if not indefinitely, provided that the products are maintained under sealed packaging conditions. The above mentioned U.S. Patent 4,455,333 also contains a disclosure of a quantitative method for measuring the textural dichotomy characteristics of the multiple texture cookies which are made by the sugar crystallization manipulation suggested by that Patent and also disclose certain minimum quantitive standards which that Patent states should be met when that quantitative method is employed to measure the textural dichotomy of those cookies. Cookies made in accordance with the present invention utilizing starch hydrolysates in one of the doughs to adjust and control the texture of that dough when baked are readily capable not only of meeting the afore mentioned quantitative textural dichotomy standards as set forth in that Patent, but also exhibit distinct sensory organoleptic textural dichotomies. In the embodiments of the present invention described below, starch hydrolysates of certain Dextrose Equivalent D.E. values and in effective amounts are incorporated into doughs which otherwise contain typical dough ingredients. The starch hydrolysates impart a texture to these doughs, upon baking to intermediate water activity levels, which is substantially harder than the texture that would otherwise result in such intermediate water activity baked products in the absence of the starch hydrolysates. The above mentioned typical dough ingredients include flour and water. In addition the typical dough ingredients may also include various shortenings, sugars and other additive ingedients as flavoring, leavening, coloring agents, etc. Intermediate water activity levels as employed herein are baked products which have an a The preferred starch hydrolysates contemplated by the present invention are those which have a D.E. Dextrose Equivalent of about 42 or less. Starch hydrolysates of such D.E. values include compositions which are generally referred to as maltodextrins and syrup solids. One such syrup solid which is readily available on the market is corn syrup solids. However, it will be understood that the source of the starches from which the starch hydrolysates of the present invention may be derived is not limited. Those sources, whether the starch hydrolysate is a maltodextrin or a syrup solid, may include for example rice or corn, as well as grains, potato or tapioca. Starch hydrolysates, whether they be maltodextrins or syrup solids, are typically of non or low sweetness, food approved, nutritive saccharide polymers that are prepared by the partial hydrolysis of starches with safe and suitable acids and or enzymes. In the production of such starch hydrolysates, the starch linkages are broken to produce varying sized sugar molecules, ranging from small amounts of the simplest single unit sugar molecule of dextrose or glucose to the more complex oligosaccharide molecules of up to Malto decaoses or greater. This conversion process is carried out until the desired D.E. Dextrose Equivalent is reached. The starches, prior to conversion, have a D.E. value of zero, whereas the starches when their linkages are totally cleaved into their individual molecular units have a D.E. of 100. Starches which have been partially converted so as to have D.E. values of less than 20 are generally termed maltodextrins. Where the conversion process has been carried out further to D.E. values of 20 or more, the product is generally referred to as syrup solids or syrups. Thus, it will be seen that at least to some measure, the D.E. value is a measure of the molecular weight of the starch hydrolysate. In the present invention, starch hydrolysates of D.E. value 42 or less are preferred to achieve the degree of hardness upon baking that is contemplated by the present invention. Starch hydrolysates having such D.E. values are generally capable of being dried to solid form, whereas those having higher D.E. s are syrupy or liquid in nature and are not generally dried. Although starch hydrolysates which are typically dried are preferred for use in the present invention, it will be understood that the starch hydrolysates which may be employed in the present invention need not necessarily be dried as they are incorporated in the doughs of the present invention. It may be desirable to incorporate undried starch hydrolysates into the doughs and, if this is done, all that is necessary is to compensate for the amount of water which is also added to the dough by the amount of liquid which may be present in the starch hydrolysate in order to achieve the desired dough workability. The amounts of starch hydrolysates which have been found to be effective to impart the desired substantially harder texture to the dough are on the order of about 8 weight percent or more of the total weight of the dough, before baking. Even more preferably, an amount of starch hydrolysates comprising about 14 20 percent by weight of the total weight of the premixed dough is preferred of starch hydrolysates having a D.E. between about 10 20. Cookies incorporating the starch hydrolysates in the latter amounts and D.E. values have been found to very closely emulate the crisper, the friable outside surface of fresh, home baked cookies, such as Toll House cookies. The substantially harder texture as contemplated herein is in contrast to soft and chewy textures. The term is intended to be inclusive of a range of textures other than soft and chewy textures of from very hard at one extreme to crumbly at the other extreme with crisp or brittle textures falling somewhere in between. In any event, when a baked dough having the substantially hard texture, as the term is contemplated in the present invention, is combined with a baked dough having a soft and chewy texture, the texture of the harder textured dough will be sufficiently distinct from the texture of the soft and chewy dough to be readily perceived upon sensible organoleptic examination, as well as quantitative textural dichotomy measurements. As previously stated, the starch hydrolysates of the present invention are readily compatible with sugars of either the readily crystallizable variety, i.e. sucrose, the crystallization resistant sugars, i.e. reducing sugars such as fructose and dextrose, or mixtures thereof. Thus, the levels of sugars in the doughs may be readily varied together with the starch hydrolysates to achieve sweetness and realize texture adjustment and control. By way of example, sucrose may be added to the dough if a high sweetness in the baked product, for example cookies, is desired. In this event the quantity of starch hydrolysates would typically be reduced somewhat to compensate for the hardening effect of the sucrose. Conversely, greater amounts of starch hydrolysates may be included in the dough to achieve similar textural qualities where the amounts of sucrose are reduced when lower degrees of sweetness are desired. Indeed, the starch hydrolysates of the present invention are capable of achieving a wide range of textured hardnesses in the baked dough in the complete absence of sucrose. Moreover, reducing sugars, such as fructose and dextrose, which would otherwise tend to result in a soft chewy dough upon baking may be combined with the starch hydrolysates in the doughs of the present invention and still result in the hardness textural qualities desired. The inclusion of such reducing sugars may be advantageous for any one of several reasons, e.g. sweetness, dough handling or spread. What is important in the present invention is the utilization of the starch hydrolysates to adjust and control the texture of the baked dough product to result in a harder texture than would otherwise occur in their absence, whether these starch hydrolysates are used alone or whether the dough also includes sugars. Where baked products are desired which exhibit a dichotomy of textures, e.g. crisp and soft, chewy, two doughs may be laminated together and baked. One of the doughs may contain a crystallization resistant sugar to achieve the soft, chewy texture. The other dough would contain the starch hydrolysates of the present invention so as to achieve the harder texture. In order to produce a baked product in which these two laminated doughs result in an organoleptic perception of textural dichotomy, the thickness of the respective laminations may be on the order of about 1 4 mm. The ratio of the softer to harder dough may vary. By way of example a ratio of 2 1 has been found to be acceptable. Although it is believed that the present invention will be fully appreciated after considering the foregoing description, examples of specific embodiments of the invention follow.

These cookie shapes were then baked in an electric chamber oven with no forced convection or water injection at 180 The baked cookies were then cooled and sealed as in Example 1. The following evaluations were then performed at the following times Cookies were prepared from two doughs as follows All ingredients with the exception of the water were at ambient temperature. The top dough mixing procedure was as follows The water was added to this mixture and mixing was continued for 3 minutes on No. 1 speed. The flour, sodium bicarbonate and salt were then added and mixing was continued for 3 minutes on No. 2 speed. The bottom dough mixing procedure was as follows The water was added to this mixture and mixing was continued for 1.5 minutes on speed No. 2. The flour, sodium bicarbonate and salt were then added and mixing was continued for 3 minutes on No. 2 speed. About 5 g. of the bottom dough was pressed into a circle of about 1 9 16 inches diameter and placed on a cookie sheet. About 11 g of the top dough was pressed into a circle of about 1 13 16 inches diameter and placed on top of the bottom dough circle. These superimposed doughs were then baked in a preheated electric chamber oven with no forced convection for 8 minutes at 191 It was observed that somewhat excessive spread of the bottom dough relative to the size of the top dough had occurred. After 24 hours, however, the sensory perception of the top and bottom of the cookies was crisp and the center of the cookies was chewy. Cookies were prepared from two doughs as follows All ingredients with the exception of the water were at ambient temperature. The outer dough mixing procedure was as set forth in Example 10. The bottom dough mixing procedure was as follows The high fructose corn syrup and vanilla were added and mixing was continued for 1 minute on speed No. 1. The water was added to this mixture and mixing was continued for 1 minute on speed No. 1. The flour, starch, sodium bicarbonate and salt were then added and mixing was continued for 2 minutes on No. 3 speed. 320 g of chocolate chips were then added to 800 g of this bottom dough mixture. This dough was then mixed for 1 2 minute at No. 1 speed. About 11.2 g of the bottom dough was pressed into a circle of about 1.2 inches diameter and placed on a cookie sheet. About 5.8 g of the top dough was pressed into a circle of about 2 inches diameter and placed on top of the bottom dough circle. These superimposed doughs were then baked in a preheated electric chamber oven with no forced convection for 9 minutes at 191 It was observed that the top dough flowed around the edge of the bottom dough to form a seal. After 24 hours the sensory perception of the baked product was a crunchy outer shell and a soft, spongy center. Cookies were prepared from two doughs as follows The outer dough mixing procedure was as follows The water was added to this mixture and mixing was continued 3 minutes on No. 1 speed. The flour, sodium bicarbonate and salt were then added and mixing was continued for 3 minutes on No. 2 speed. The inner dough mixing procedure was as follows The refrigerated dry ingedients were added and mixing was continued for about 1 minute on No. 1 speed until the mixture was uniformly granular. The refrigerated liquids were then added and mixing was continued until the mixture was uniform. 225g of chocolate chips were then stirred into 800 g of this inner dough mixture. The inner dough was refrigerated overnight and the outer dough was fresh. About 1.75 g of the outer dough was pressed into a circle of about 1.6 inches diameter and placed on a cookie sheet. A ball of about 10.5 g of the inner dough was placed on top of the bottom dough circle. About 1.75 g of outer dough was pressed into a circle of about 2 inches in diameter and placed over the inner dough ball. This dough form was then pressed on top to flatten and the edges of the outer dough were pressed to seal the form. These superimposed doughs were then baked in a preheated electric chamber oven with no forced convection for 7 1 2 minutes at 191 After 24 hours, the sensory perception of the cookies was a crisp outside and a chewy inside. It will thus be seen that the starch hydrolysates as contemplated by the present invention are capable of imparting desired hardness textures to baked products of intermediate water activity levels, including baked laminated doughs having textural dichotomies. This ability is not only surprising in view of the contrary suggestions of the prior art, but also results in the several aforementioned advantages. By employing the starch hydrolysates of the present invention, accurate adjustment and control of the hardness texture of the baked product may be readily and inexpensively achieved. At the same time the sweetness of the product may be accurately adjusted and controlled over substantially wider ranges than heretofore possible where the sugars were manipulated to control the texture of the baked product. Due to the ability to accurately adjust and control the texture of the baked product, it is possible to more closely approach the textural characteristics of fresh, home baked products e.g. Toll House cookies. Moreover, the textures which are achieved by the present invention are attained rapidly after baking and remain shelf stable for substantial period of time thereafter. It will be understood that the invention may be practiced either by the use of a single starchhydrolysate or a blend of starch hydrolysates having differing D.E. values. It will also be understood that the embodiments of the invention that have been described are merely a few of those possible.
