# METHOD FOR THE MAGNETIZATION OF WELL CASING

## Abstract
A magnetic field is induced in a well casing. The location of this field may then be sensed while drilling another well and the direction of drilling modified in response to the sensed location of the first well. This allows one to either avoid or intersect the first well with the second well.
