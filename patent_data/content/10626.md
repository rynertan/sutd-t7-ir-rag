# A magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
A thin film magnetic recording medium for deposition on a record carrier includes a ferromagnetic alloy containing iron, cobalt and chromium. The ferromagnetic alloy consists of from 0 55 cobalt, from 8 22 of chromium with the remainder iron. The composition range of the magnetic thin film layer is shown in the cross hatched portion of the ternary diagram of figure 2. The preferred range of chromium is from 10 18 with the ratio of iron to cobalt being 1 1. The magnetic recording layer is vacuum deposited over an extended portion of a record carrier for storing information which is represented by the spatial distribution of magnetic transitions in the magnetic layer.
