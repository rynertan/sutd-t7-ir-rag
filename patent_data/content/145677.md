## Description
Improved Teletext receiver The present invention refers to a receiver for an information transmission system, the information being represented by a plurality of text pages, each one selectable by the user, among all the receivable pages, sending to the receiver a sequence of data which indicate the selected page, the receiver comprising control means including a plurality of keys, which may be pressed by the user to produce control signals, processing means, coupled to said control means, to generate, in dependence of said control signals, said sequence of data, and a decoder circuit, coupled to said processing means, able to receive, select, process and reproduce the text pages, as a consequence of the receiving of the sequence of data.It is known that in many European countries there are already operating or in an experimental phase transmission systems the so called Teletext or Televideo systems , which allow to transmit additional information, inserted in the standard video signal in the form of a digital coded signal, in a few normally free lines during the vertical retrace phase.The said digital coded signal, at the user control, is decoded by a suitable decoding circuit, which is known in se, and may be inserted as an additional board in a normal television receiver, so allowing to display information pages, with text or graphics. The number of the pages available to the user is of a few hundreds, grouped by matter e.g. last news pag. 110 125, sports pag. 150 162, politics pag. 210 222, games pag. 315 345, etc in the first page normally there is a directory, by matter, with the corresponding page numbers.Using the known decoders, the user is compelled, each time he or she want to see a selected page, to press consecutively three numeric keys so to build the three figures number of the desired page moreover, each time he or she wants to see the next page because the wanted information occupies a few consecutive pages he or she is compelled to build a new three figures number, if not even to recall the directory page, having in the mean time forgotten the desired page number.Therefore many remote control keypresses are necessary, so reducing also the life of the remote control batteries moreover all these manoevres are uneasy, and also it may so happen that the remote control receiver does not receive correctly a command e.g. if the transmitter was inadvertently misaligned and in this case, if the user does not notice the error, the received number sequence being incorrect, it must be repeated completely from the beginning.The object of the present invention is therefore to indicate a receiver including a teletext signal decoder not having the described disadvantages.The present invention refers therefore to a receiver for an information transmission system, the information being represented by a plurality of text pages, each one selectable by the user, among all the receivable pages, sending to the receiver a sequence of data which indicate the selected page, the receiver comprising control means including a plurality of keys, which may be pressed by the user to produce control signals, processing means, coupled to said control means, to generate, in dependence of said control signals, said sequence of data, and a decoder circuit, coupled to said processing means, able to receive, select, process and reproduce the text pages, as a consequence of the receiving of the sequence of data, characterized in that the processing means do include means which, as a consequence of a single pressing of a single key of the control means, generate and send to the decoder circuit a data sequence so to allow the selection and the display of one page, selected by the user among all receivable pages.The invention is described in the following, in order to clarify it, in particular with reference to the attached drawings, which are given only as an informative and not limiting example.Figure 1 represents a part of the block diagram of a television receiver comprising a teletext decoder of known type.Figure 2 represents the block diagram of the same part of a television receiver comprising an improved teletext decoder according to the present invention.Figure 3 represents the block diagram of the basic functions performed by the circuits included in the decoder according to the invention.In the figure 1 the number 1 indicates an infrared remote control transmitter, comprising a keyboard and known coding and transmitting circuits e.g. the integrated circuit SAB 3021 of the firm Philips the number 2 indicates an infrared receiving circuit comprising an amplifier and a decoder e.g. integrated circuit SAB 3042 of the firmPhilips the outputs D data output and C clock output are coupled to a known control unit 3, which controls the tuning and the analogic controls of the television receiver e.g. comprising the integrated circuits SAB 1018, SAB 3034 and the microprocessor 8048 of the firm Philips , and to a teletext signals decoder circuit 4, of known type including for instance the integrated circuits SAB 5020,SAB 5030, SAB 5040 and SAB 5050 of the firm Philips .The remote control transmitter comprises a first group of 10 keys with the number from 0 to 9 a second group of 9 keys with the letters from A to I two keys with the labels TEXT and TV other additional keys, normally present in remote control transmitters and not shown in the drawing.The tuning control unit 3 is coupled to a random access memory circuit 5 to memorize and recall the tuning data for the preferred broadcasting stations to be selected a circuit 6 to amplify and filter the tuning voltage for the tuning unit itself which is not represented in the figure a circuit 7 to amplify and filter the control voltages for the circuits which controls the analogic commands brightness, volume, contrast etc. also not represented in the figure.The teletext signals decoder circuit 4 receives also an input signal V from the video detector of the set, not shown in the figure, and supplies at three output terminals the color signals R,G,B to be applied to the final video amplifiers of the set.As regards the above cited integrated circuits and the relevant associated circuits reference is made, for a more detailed description, to the catalogs and the application notes of the manufacturer.The operation of the circuit represented in figure 1 is as follows When the TV key is depressed, the decoder 2 transmits to the microprocessor operated control unit 3 an enabling command which enables the normal TV receiving operation pressing consecutively the numbered keys or any one of the additional keys not shown in the figure , the control unit performs the tuning operation on a different station, provided that station has been already memorized in the memory 5 by means of the circuit 6, or the regulation of the desired analog command by means of circuit 7.Depressing the TEXT key the receiver 2 sends to the decoder 4 an enabling command which enables the operation as a teletext receiver pressing consecutively three numbered keys, corresponding to the three figures number of the desired teletext page, the teletext decoder selects the choosed page among all the transmitted pages, memorize all the lines of the said page and sends to the R,G,B outputs the suitable signals to display on the picture tube of the set the desired page.On the contrary, pressing one of the letter keys, the user may select some known options relating to the way how to visualize the pages A small, i.e. normal size of characters, B large, i.e. double character height, C clear, i.e. clear the teletext page, E mixed, teletext page superimposed to the normal video picture, etc. . Eventually, pressing the TV key the normal television reception is reestablished.In figure 2 the numbers 2,4,6 and 7 indicate blocks which correspond both as construction and as operation to the blocks indicated in figure 1 by the same numbers they therefore are not described again for sake of conciseness.The numbers 11,13 and 15 indicate in order a remote control transmitter, a microprocessor operated control unit and a memory circuit which are the like of the circuits indicated in figure 1 by the numbers 1,3 and 5, modified according to the present invention.The remote control transmitter comprises, besides the keys already described referring to fig. 1, another group of 5 keys which are labeled respectively , , MAG , , M . The circuit which is the infrared remote control receiver, indicated by the number 2, is only connected to the control unit 13, which supplies two data and clock outputs D and C to the teletext decoder.The control unit 13 is so constructed to perform, besides the functions of the tuning control unit 3, also other functions relating to the teletext operation, according to the present invention.The memory circuit 15 , like the circuit 5, is connected to the control unit 13, but is different having a greater number of cells.The operation of the circuit represented in fig. 2 is the following Depressing the key after the TEXT key has been depressed, a operation condition is selected which may be called of direct request and the control unit 13 is enabled to perform the same functions as per the circuit of fig. 1 when the TEXT key is depressed.In fact, depressing consecutively the numbered keys or the keys labeled by the letters from A to I , unit 13 supplies to the teletext decoder the same data and clock signals D and C as received by the remote control unit 2, so that the teletext decoder can respectively select a page indicated by three figures or perform the display operations in the mean time control unit 13 memorizes in a internal register the number of the selected page.If, on the contrary, after the direct request condition has been selected, the key or the key is depressed, control unit 13 reads in the internal register the number of the last selected page, increments or decrements respectively said page number in the register by one unit and sends to the teletext decoder the new page number.In this way it is very fast and easy for the user to display consecutively a few information pages, starting from one of them.If, on the contrary, after the direct request condition has been selected, the M key is depressed, control unit 13 is made ready to store in the memory 15 the three figures of the pesently selected page contained in the said internal register.After that, when one of the ten numbered keys is depressed, control unit 13 stores the said three figures in a selected group of three memory cells, corresponding to said key number.In this way it is possible to memorize ten preferred pages each one related to one of the ten numbered keys.If the MAG key is depressed the direct request condition is leaved and the control unit is enabled to a selection condition which may be called of indirect request, that is a selection made recalling the page number from the memory, and not directly inputting it by the keyboard.In this operating condition, to recall any one of the ten previously memorized pages, it is sufficient to press only one key, that is the corresponding one among the ten numbered keys the control unit then reads from the memory, in the cells corresponding to the inputted address, the relevant memorized page number, and sends the three figures to the teletext decoder.In this way , considering that normally the page numbers, corresponding to the different types of information, remain unchanged as long as possible in order to aid the selection by the user, it is possible to store the page numbers corresponding to the most interesting information and recall them very easily depressing only one key.Moreover in the indirect request condition, according to a first preferred embodiment, depressing the or key, the control unit recalls from memory 15 the figures which correspond to the preceding or successive cells and send them to the teletext decoder. In this way it is possible in an easy way to request sequentially all the preferred pages previously memorized.In a second preferred embodiment, depressing the or key, in the indirect request condition too, the control unit 13 reads in the internal register the number of the last selected page, increments or decrements respectively said page number in the register by one unit and sends to the teletext decoder the new page number.In this way the user can in the indirect request condition depressing one key select the initial page of the group of pages pertaining to the preferred matter and then by means of the key sequentially scan the following pages of said group.The operation of the microprocessor controlled control unit 13 may be better understood examining the elemental function block diagram represented in figure 3, referring particularly to the the sequential and indirect request of pages.In figure 3 the signal LOOP activates a block 20, which verifies if any key of the remote control unit has been depressed The NO output generates the LOOP activation signal, the SI output activates a block 21 which verifies if the function TEXT has previously been selected.The NO output of the block 21 supplies a TEST signal to enable the circuits, not described as completely known, which control the operation of the television receiver the SI output supplies an enabling signal to the block 22, which verifies if the 8f function has previously been selected the SI output teletext operation in direct request condition activates a block 23 which verifies if the M function has been previously selected the NO output direct request of a teletext page activates a block 24 which verifies if the depressed key corresponds to a figure from 0 to 9 the SI output activates a block 25 which sends said figure to the teletext decoder and which supplies the LOOP activation signal the NO output activates a block 26 and then a block 27 which verify if the depressed key corresponds to one of the symbols or the SI outputs of blocks 26 and 27 activate respectively the blocks 28 and 29 which send to the teletext decoder three figures which correspond respectively to the last page number incremented or decremented by one unit and which then supply the LOOP activation signal the NO outputs of blocks 26 and 27 supply a FUNZ signal which activates the execution, in a known way, of the functions relating to the way how to display the pages.The SI output of block 23 teletext memorizing function activates a block 30 which verifies if the depressed key corresponds to a figure from 0 to 9 the NO output supplies the LOOP activation signal the SI output activates a block 31 which performs the memorization of the three figures corresponding to the presently selected teletext page in suitable memory cells corresponding to the number of the depressed key.The block 31 supplies then the LOOP activation signal. The NO output of block 22 activation of the indirect or magazines selection activates a block 32 which verifies if the depressed key corresponds to a number n from 0 to 9 the NO output activates the block 35 and then the block 37 which together verify if the depressed key corresponds to the symbol or to the symbol the no outputs produce the LOOP activation signal the SI outputs activate respectively the blocks 36 and 38 which increment or decrement by one unit the number n which corresponds to the last selected group of memory cells the SI output of block 32 and the blocks 36 and 38 activate then a block 33 which, according to the value of the number n , selects a certain group of memory cells and a block 34 which reads in said cells the page number of three figures which they contain and sends the three figures to the teletext decoding unit.From the description of figure 3 it is clear the way how to implement, according to the present invention, the functions of up or down sequential request of teletext pages blocks 24 29 memorization of a preferred page number blocks 23,30,31 indirect request of a previously memorized page blocks 32 34 sequential request of previously memorized pages blocks 35 38 .From the description the present invention s advantages are clear.In fact the reading of the information contained in a sequence of teletext page is made very easy due to the possibility of up or down sequential request of the pages, which allows a fast and error free selection.An additional advantage consists in the possibility to memorize the numbers of the most interesting pages which in this way may be recalled directly depressing only one key and without being compelled to recall and examine the general directory.Many modifications of course are possible without departing from the scope of the present invention.For instance it is possible to adopt integrated circuits other than the cited ones, which perform the same functions, to code, transmit and decode the teletext signals, to build the control unit, which may be also based on different microprocessors.In the described example ten groups of memory cells have been used to memorize the numbers of ten preferred pages it may be advisable, of course, to use a greater number of cells to memorize for instance 20 or 30 page numbers it may also be appropriate to add to the remote control unit special keys to memorize the page numbers, labeled for instance last news , sports , politics , economics and so on. Moreover instead of the remote control unit a cheaper keyboard may be used, directly connected to the control unit. A further modification may consists in the addition of an automatic research circuit to sequentially scan the pages, starting from the present selected page, controlled by one or more dedicated keys for instance one for the up search, one for the down search and one for the stop so that an automatic display of many consecutive pages may be obtained.At least all that has been described may be easily and advantageously applied to receive on a home terminal the information transmitted on the telephonic network according to PRESTEL or VIDEOTEL or similar systems.
