# Straight chain paraffin producing material.

## Abstract
A straight chain paraffin producing material obtained by i treating a thermal cracked oil distillate boiling in the range of 120 to 290 C and containing aliphatic olefins, at a temperature of 0 to 330 C in liquid phase in the presence of an acid catalyst, said thermal cracked oil distillate being ob tained from a thermal cracking process of thermally cracking a petrolic heavy residual oil at a temperature not lower than 400 C and not exceeding 700 C and then ii separating and removing from the reaction mixture heavy components boiling higher than said distillate.
