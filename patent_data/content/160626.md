# WARRANTY SEAL CAP, PARTICULARLY FOR BOTTLES TO BE USED IN PHARMACEUTICS

## Abstract
The warranty seal cap, particularly for bottles to be used in pharmaceutics, in which a rubber diaphragm located on the mouth of the neck of the bottle is intended to be pierced by the needle which serves for the extraction of the liquid from the bottle, is characterized in that a button, breakable by means of a pressure acting downwards on the cap and bounded by an area that helps the opening, is provided in the top wall. The area that helps the opening may be comprised of one or more weakening or score lines or one or more cuts. In the case in which one or more cuts are provided for, if it is desired to assure anyway the keeping of a sterile environment between the top wall and the rubber di aphragm, hermetic sealing means are provided between the button and the top wall, preferably an annular sealing located at the cut area.
