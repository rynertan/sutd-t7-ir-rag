# CIRCUIT BOARD FOR USE IN CAPACITIVE KEYBOARD

## Abstract
A capacitive keyboard circuit board 10 in which the capacitive plates 121, 131 are formed from separate conductive plates which are mounted onto the component side of the board. The plates are manufactured from thin metal and have mounting pins 133, 135 located perpendicu lar thereto. The mounting pins project through mounting holes 132, 134 in the circuit board and are soldered to traces 322, 324 on the conductor side of the circuit board. A completed keyboard assembly includes keyswitch actuators 61 mounted on the component side of the board in overlying relation to corresponding capacitive plates.
