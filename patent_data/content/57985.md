# METHOD OF PERMANENTLY SIZING POLYESTER YARNS AND FABRICS WOVEN THEREWITH

## Abstract
In a method for permanently sizing a polyester or polyester blend yarn wherein an aqueous sizing composition is applied to the yarn and subsequently cured, the sizing composition comprises an aqueous polymer latex of an emulsion polymer combrising 45 to 65 by weight of one or more polymerised C₄ C₈ alkyl acrylates, 28 to 52 by weight of one or more vinyl polymerised aromatic compounds or a mixture thereof with up to an equal weight of polymerised methyl methacrylate, and 3 to 14 by weight of one or more of polymerised acrylic, methacrylic or itaconic acid and containing 2 to 40 by weight of a melamine aminoplast resin, based on the weight of the polymer. By incorporating a pigment in the sizing composition colour fast pigmented sized yarns and fabrics can be produced.
