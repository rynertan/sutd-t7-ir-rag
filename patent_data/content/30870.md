## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING AZIRIDINE 2 CARBOXYLIC ACID SALT This invention relates to a novel process for producing an aziridine 2 carboxylic acid salt which is very useful as an intermediate for an alpha amino acid, an agricultural chemical, a pharmaceutical, etc. Some methods for the production of an aziridine 2carboxylic acid salt have been know. For example, for the production of sodium aziridine 2 carboxylate, there are known 1 a method which comprises neutralizing alpha chloro beta alanine hydrochloride in water with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, and while heating the neutralization product under reflux, adding a IN aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide dropwise so that the pH of the aqueous solution is maintained at 7 7.5 tR. D. Gundermann,Chem.Ber., 93, 1640 1960 , and 2 a method which comprises hydrolyzing isopropyl aziridine 2 carboxylate obtained by reaction between isopropyl alpha,beta dibromopropionate and liquid ammonia, with sodium ethoxide in a mixed solvent consisting of ether, ethanol and water E. Kyburz, Helv. Chim. Acta, 49, 368 1966 1. Lithium aziridine 2carboxylate is known to be produced by 3 a method which comprises treating alpha chloro beta alanine ethyl ester hydrochloride with triethanolamine in ethanol to form ethyl aziridine 2 carboxylate, and hydrolyzing the product with lithium hydroxide in a mixed solvent consisting of ethanol and water K. D. Gundermann, Chem. Ber., 93, 1639 1960 .The method 1 , however, has the defect that it has to be operated while the concentration of the starting alphachloro beta alanine hydrochloride in the reaction system is maintained at as low as about 1 by weight. The methods 2 and 3 , on the other hand, have the defect that synthesis of the aziridine 2 carboxylic acid ester is complex and the yield of the final product is low. Accordingly, none of these prior methods are entirely satisfactory in cbmmercial practice. It is an object of this invention therefore to provide a commercially advantageous process for producing an aziridine 2 carboxylic acid salt. The present invention provides a process for producing an alkali metal salt, an alkaline earth metal salt or an ammonium salt of aziridine 2 carboxylic acid, which comprises treating an alpha halogeno beta aminopropionic acid, its ester or a mineral acid salt of said acid or ester with an alkali metal hydroxide, an alkaline earth metal hydroxide or aqueous ammonia in water or a water containing organic solvent. The reaction conditions are mild, and the yield can be high. An aziridine 2 carboxylic acid salt is a very important intermediate for synthesis of amino acids and other compounds, as is demonstrated, for example, by the fact that treatment of lithium aziridine 2 carboxylate, in 15 sulfuric acid yields serine, a kind of alpha amino acid. The process for producing aziridine 2 carboxylic acid salts in accordance with this invention has many advantages over the prior art in that it does not require pH control or heating and the reaction operation is simple, that an aziridine 2 carboxylic acid salt can be produced by using the reactant in a higher concentration than in the prior art in the reaction solution, and that the desired product can be obtained selectively without substantially forming by products. Accordingly, the process of this invention is of very high utilitarian value in commercial practice. In the process of this invention, the starting alpha halogeno beta aminopropionic acid or its mineral acid salt may, for example, include alpha chloro beta aminopropionic acid, alpha bromo beta aminopropionic acid, alphachloro beta aminopropionic acid hydrochloride or sulfate, and alpha bromo beta aminopropionic acid hydrochloride or sulfate. Examples of the alpha halogeno beta aminopropionic acid ester or its mineral acid salt are alpha chloro betaaminopropionic acid esters, alpha bromo beta aminopropionic acid esters, alpha chloro beta aminopropionic acid ester hydrochlorides and sulfates, and alph√° bromo beta aminopro pionic acid ester hydrochlorides and sulfates. The ester used is an alkyl ester having 1 to 4 carbon atom in the alkyl moiety, and methyl esters, ethyl esters, isopropyl esters, tertiary butyl esters, etc. are used frequently. The mineral acid salt of an alpha halogeno betaaminopropionic acid used as a starting material in the process of this invention is obtained by reacting an alpha, beta dinalogenopropionitrile or an alpha halogenoacrylonitrile with ammonia in water or in an organic solvent, and causing hydrogen chloride or sulfuric acid to act on the reaction mixture. The alpha halogeno beta aminopropionic acid can be isolated by dissolving its mineral acid salt in the smallest amount of water, adding anhydrous ethanol, and neutralizing it K. D. Gundermann, Chem.Ber., 91, 160 1958 3. The mineral acid salt of an alpha halogeno betaaminopropionic acid ester, for example, methyl alpha chlorobeta aminopropionate hydrochloride, can be obtained by esterifying alpha chloro beta aminopropionic acid hydrochloride in anhydrous methanol saturated with hydrochloric acid K. D. Gundermann, Chem. Ber., 91, 160 1958 3. In the process of this invention, an alkali metal hydroxide, an alkaline earth metal hydroxide, or aqueous ammonia is used to perform the cyclization reaction of an alpha halogeno beta aminopropinonic acid and the cyclization reaction and hydrolysis reaction of an alpha halogenobeta aminopropionic acid ester. Specific examples of the alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide are lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, beryllium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide and barium hydroxide.The alkali is used in an amount of at least 2 equivalents based on the starting material when the starting material is a free alpha halogeno beta aminopropionic acid or an alpha halogeno beta aminopropionic acid ester, and in an amount of at least 3 equivalents based on the starting material when the starting material is a mineral acid salt of the alpha halogeno beta aminopropionic acid or the alpha halogeno beta aminopropionic acid ester. The upper limit to the amount of the alkali is not specially limited. But it is not necessary to use it in large excess, and usually amounts of up to 5 equivalents are sufficient. The process of this invention is performed in water or in a water containing organic solvent. In other words, the reaction can be performed in an aqueous solution or in a solvent consisting of water and a water miscible organic solvent. Examples of the water miscible organic solvent include alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, tert. butanol, Cellosolve and methylCellosolve, acetone, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, N,N dimethyl formamide, N, diethyl formamide and dimethyl sulfoxide. These organic solvents may be used as a mixture of two or more. When water and the organic solvent are used together, the ratio between them can be chosen as desired. The amount of water or the water containing organic solvent is 3 to 200 times, preferably 5 to 100 timers, the amount of the starting alpha halogeno beta aminopropionic acid, its ester or a mineral acid salt of said acid or ester. In performing the process of this invention there is no particular restriction on the method and order of adding the starting material, the alkali and the reaction solvent. Usually, aqueous ammonia or the alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide as an aqueous solution or a solid is added with stirring to a solution of the alpha halogenobeta aminopropionic acid, its ester or a mineral acid salt of the acid or ester in water and or a water miscible organic solvent in a desired concentration, Alternatively, the alpha halogeno beta aminopropionic acid, its ester or a mineral acid salt of the acid or ester may be added to aqueous ammonia or an aqueous solution or suspension of the alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide. The reaction temperature is in the range of 0 to 100 C, preferably 20 to 80pC. The reaction is carried out usually under atmospheric pressure, but if desired, it may be carried out under reduced or elevated pressure. The reaction time varies depending upon the reaction conditions.Usually, it comes to an end in 0.5 to 50 hours, particularly in 2.0 to 30 hours. The end point of the reaction can be rapidly and easily determined by thin layer chromatography. In the process of this invention, the aziridine2 carboxylic acid is obtained in the form of an alkali metal salt, an alkaline earth matal salt or an ammonium salt corresponding to the alkali metal hydroxide, alkaline earth metal hydroxide or aqueous ammonia used in the reaction. If desired, the organic solvent may be removed from the reaction product under reduced pressure to obtain the salt in the form of an aqueous solution.
