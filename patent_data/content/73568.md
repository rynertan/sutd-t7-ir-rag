# Bright chromium plating baths.

## Abstract
The invention provides a hexavalent chromium plating bath containing chromic acid, an iodine releasing com pound and or a bromine releasing compound such as io date, periodate, bromate or perbromate, and a carboxylate which is stable in the bath. Exemplary stable carboxylates include acetic acid, propionic acid, chloroacetic acid, tri chloroacetic acid, succinic acid, sulfoacetic acid, benzoic acid, picolinic acid, and nicotinic acid. Bright chromium deposits can be produced with these baths at high current efficiencies employing high temperatures with substantially no low current density etch.
