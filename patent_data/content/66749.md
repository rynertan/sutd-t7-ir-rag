# Ignition system for internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
An ignition system for an internal combustion engine is disclosed which includes a separate ignition transformer for each spark plug in the engine. Each of the ignition transformers is enabled by means of signals produced by a crankshaft position sensor. Pulsating DC currents are then caused to flow in the primary windings of the ignition transformer thereby inducing a high voltage into a secondary winding of the transformer. A combination ignition transformer and spark plug cover is also disclosed.
