# Polyborate esters and their use in lubricants.

## Abstract
Polyborate ester compositions are prepared by reacting ortho boric acid with at least one alcohol or phenol in a substantially inert organic liquid, which is immiscible with water and has a boiling point in the range from about 80 to about 300 C at standard pressure, and by continuously removing the water which is produced by the reaction.
