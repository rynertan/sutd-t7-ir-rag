# Coating compositions.

## Abstract
A composition for anti fouling coatings includes 20 to 80 of heavy metal particles such as copper or a copper alloy powder. To prevent instability on storage the resin matrix has a low acid value, preferably not greater than 5 mg KOH g. The resin is one of a type cured by a free radical initiated cross linking mechanism such as an unsaturated polyester, vi nyl ester or urethane acrylate. The composition will usually be used as a gelcoat in GRP lamination in building boats or other marine structures.
