# System for heat energy conversion.

## Abstract
A method and system of converting low temperature energy into high temperature energy comprises steps of con centrating a high boiling liquid 3 diluted with a low boiling liquid through evaporation of the low boiling liquid condens ing the vapor 2 of the low boiling liquid through its absorp tion into an intermediate heat medium liquid 5 , while cool ing, evaporating the diluted intermediate heat medium 4 , and absorbing the vapor 2 generated in the last step into the concentrated high boiling liquid 1 , thereby generating dilu tion heat and phase change heat. The intermediate heat medium 5 has the property that the difference between the saturation temperature thereof and the saturation tempera ture of the high boiling liquid 1 becomes small under a low pressure and the difference between the saturation tempera tures of both liquids becomes large under a high pressure.
