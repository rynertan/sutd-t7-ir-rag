# Organometallic copolymers, process for their preparation, and shaped articles of an inorganic carbide obtained therefrom.

## Abstract
Organometallic copolymers comprising A a polycarbosilane portion and B a polymetallosiloxane portion in which the main chain contains metalloxane units M O , where M is Ti or Zr, and siloxane units Si O . The organometallic copolymers are crosslinked with at least some of the Si atoms of the polycarbosilane portion A being bonded through oxygen to at least some of the M or Si atoms of the polymetallosiloxane portion B . The organometallic copolymers can be produced by a process which comprises reacting 1 a polycarbosilane with 2 a polymetallosiloxane in an organic solvent in an inert atmosphere thereby to bond at least some of the silicon atoms of the polycarbosilane 1 to at least some of the metal atoms M and or silicon atoms of the polymetallosiloxane 2 through oxygen atoms. When the organometallic copolymers are molded and fired shaped articles of an inorganic carbide can be obtained that have improved physical properties.
