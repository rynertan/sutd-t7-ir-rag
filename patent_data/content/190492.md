# Carbon ignition temperature depressing agent and method of regenerating an automotive particulate trap utilizing said agent.

## Abstract
A carbon ignition temperature depressing agent is disclosed along with a method of regenerating an automo tive particulate trap using the ignition temperature depress ing agent. The agent is effective to promote oxidation of on board collected carbonaceous particles extracted from the automobile exhaust. The agent comprises a an orga nometallic compound that upon heating the combustion process of the engine forms a readily reducible metal oxide which when finely divided promotes a carbonaceous ignition temperature in the range of as low as 450 F and up to as low as 675 F, and b an aerosol promoting liquid carrier effective to form a fine mist with the organometallic compound when sprayed, the carrier having a boiling point in the range of 176 302 F 80 150 C . The organometallic compound is one or more metal octoates having the metal selected from the group consisting of copper, nickel and cerium. The orga nometallic compounds are readily soluble and stable in the fuel supply used with an internal combustion engine such as an automotive diesel engine. The mixture is used in a volume amount of 10 50 milliliters per gallon of fuel or the organometallic compound is present in an amount of at least .15 .5 gm gal of fuel. The organometallic compound is proportioned to the carrier in a ratio of 1 2 to 1 10. The aerosol promoting liquid carrier is selected from the group consisting of hexane, pentane and toluene and is effective to promote a droplet size for said mixture when sprayed of substantially less, on average, of one micron.
