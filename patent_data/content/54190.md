# Apparatus and process for the production of titanium dioxide by the vapour phase oxidation of titanium tetrachloride.

## Abstract
In a process for the production of titanium dioxide by the vapour phase oxidation of titanium tetrachloride in which process entrained inert particulate material is passed through equipment used to reduce or prevent the deposition of solids thereon, the quantity of inert particulate material entrained may be affected by the varying back pressure normally obtaining in the equipment. The control of this quantity maybe improved by reducing pressure differences by means of conduit 39 between the inlet 40 and outlet 36 of a mechanical feeding device 29, 30 for the solids. This entails the transmission of the pressure from the conduit 26 into the solids delivery system 25 17 and this may be alleviated, optionally, by maintaining a head of solids in the system and or by using a system of pressurised hoppers. The invention enables the quantity of inert particu late material used to be reduced.
