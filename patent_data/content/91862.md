# Double dump single solenoid unit injector.

## Abstract
A cam driven fuel injector 10 comprising a body defining a bore 82 a driven or pumping piston 80 reciprocatively situated with the bore 82 a metering piston 84 reciprocatively positioned within the bore 82 remote from the pumping piston 80 and a metering chamber 98 defined in the bore 82 below the metering piston 84 . A spring 150 is situated within a cavity or spring cage 152 remote from the bore 82 and a nozzle 14 extends into the spring cage 152 in biasing engagement with the spring 150 to urge it to a closed position during non injecting periods. The injector 10 further including means 102, 108, 136, 160, 162, 170, 172, 174 for dumping the fuel within the metering chamber 98 to the supply 105, 106 through the spring cage 156 in correspondence with the motion of the metering piston 84 and for stabilizing the pressure force exerted on the nozzle 14 , during the dumping portion of operation, by the fuel within the spring cage 156 with the pressure force exerted on the nozzle 14 .
