# Flow rate measurement.

## Abstract
The invention comprises a method for the determination of the volumetric flow rate of multi phase fluid flows, for example, of the flow rate of an oil water mixture in a conduit. A known amount of radioisotopic tracer is injected into at least one of the phases and the concentration of the tracer in the flow is determined at a downstream sampling station, thereby enabling the flow rate of the multi phase flow to be determined. The tracer s used should be soluble in only one phase of the fluid flow with the provision that where a plurality of tracers is used, no two or more tracers are soluble in the same phase.

## Description
Flow Rate Measurement The present invention relates to the determinaton of the volumetric flow rates of multi phase fluid mixtures. Methods for the measurement of flow rates of single phase fluids, for example liquids, are well established and well known.Such methods may involve the use of, for example, current meters or various kinds of floats. Radioisotope dilution techniques are also used to measure the flow rates of single phase flows. In one such method, a solution of a suitable radioisotope tracer is injected into the flow and samples are taken at regular intervals at one or more downstream sampling stations which are sufficiently distant from the injection point to allow full mixing of the injected tracer with the flowing stream. Dilution techniques are of particular value in locations where conventional flow measuring devices are impracticable, for example sewers. The measurement of multi phase flow rates has proved to be rather difficult and, as far as the Applicants are aware, dilution techniques have not so far been successful in such measurements. Some of the problems which have arisen have been related to the stability of the tracer in the multi phase system. A tracer may be stable in one phase but prove to be reactive with the other phase or one of the other phases or the tracer may distribute itself between the phases. We have now surprisingly found that it is possible to use a radioisotope dilution technique in the determination of a multi phase liquid flow rate. Accordingly the present invention provides a method for the determination of the flow rate of a multi phase fluid flow which comprises injecting at least one, and preferably a plurality of different, radioisotope tracers into the flow, the or each of said tracers being soluble in one phase only of the flow and substantially insoluble in the other phase or phases, with the proviso that the tracers are selected such that no two or more tracers are soluble in the same phase, removing a sample of the multi phase flow from the flow at a point downstream from the point of injection of the tracer s and determining from the concentration of the tracer in at least any one phase of said sample the flow rate of that phase of the multi phase flow. One application of the method of this invention is in the determination of the flow rate of oil water mixtures along conduits and pipelines. Crude oil extracted from some oil fields contains varying amounts of water depending on the location of the field.It has hitherto proved difficult to measure the flow rate of the twophases of the liquid independently with any great accuracy. For example, conventional flowmeters, if they work at all, will measure the total flow only and it has not proved possible to adapt them. We have now found that the flow rate of an oil water twophase liquid mixture can be determined accurately by a radioisotope dilution technique according to the method of this invention. In this embodiment of the present invention the tracers used are an aqueoussoluble tracer, for example tritiated water, and organic soluble tracer, for example an organic complex of the tracer Fe59, for example ferrocene. Principles and techniques used in methods such as the total count method and the constant rate injection method for determinations of the flow rates of single phase flows may be used or adapted for use, where suitable, in the method according to this invention for the determination of multi phase fluid flow rates. The tracers may be injected separately or together into the multi phase system flow. The sampling point is selected sufficiently far downstream to allow thorough mixing of the injected tracer solutions with the multi phase flow and at this point the sample is collected in conventional manner. The sample is separated into its component phases and the concentration of the appropriate tracer in each phase measured.For example, in the constant rate injection embodiment of the method of this invention, the flow rate for each phase is calculated from the equation EMI2.1 where F2 CF1 and where F1 flow rate of phase at sample point C1 concentration of tracer in phase at sample point F2 flow rate of injected tracer material C2 concentration of tracer in injected material A wide range of radioisotope tracers may be used in the method of this invention and the actual tracer s used will depend on such factors as the nature of the phases under investigation.Suitable tracers for injection into an aqueous phase, for example, include 137Cs , 134C8 60cm2 S14CN , 51cur3 . Suitable tracers for injection into an organic phase include for example 3H and 14C in the form of a labelled hydrocarbon or other organic compound. For the gas phase, suitable tracers include 3H methane and 14C methane. In some embodiments of the method of this invention it may not be necessary to inject more than one tracer. For example, the total flow rate of a two phase liquid flow, for example oil water, may be known from separate conventional metering of the flow. In such a case, determination of the flow rate of one of the phases by the method of this invention will enable the flow rate of the other phase to be determined by simple subtraction. The method of this invention lends itself to continuous or occasional measurement of flow rates, as desired. It can also be applied in automatic fashion, with the minimum of operator involvement required. Thus, the tracer or tracers may be injected at pre set intervals or continuously through an in line mixing device and the multi phase flow automatically sampled a short distance downstream in, for example, a second in line mixer. The phases can be automatically separated and individual appropriate radiation detectors used to determine the concentration of the tracer in each phase.The determined concentration can then be compared with the injected tracer concentration and the flow rate determined.
