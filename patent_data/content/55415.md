# A rotor assembly and methods of securing a rotor blade therewithin and removing a rotor blade therefrom.

## Abstract
The rotor assembly 10 comprises a rotor disc 12 and a plurality of rotor blades 32 . The rotor disc 12 defines a plurality of blade grooves 20 and includes a plurality of tenons 22 disposed between the blade grooves 20 and defining a plurality of pin sockets 24 . Each rotor blade 32 includes a root 26 disposed within a blade groove 20 and a blade platform 30 overlaying a tenon 22 and defining a pin aperture 34 . The rotor assembly 10 further comprises a plurality of locking pins 14 extending through the pin apertures 34 and into the pin sockets 24 to secure the rotor blades 32 against axial movement, each pin 14 including a head 36 and a base 40 to limit radial movement of the pin 14 .
