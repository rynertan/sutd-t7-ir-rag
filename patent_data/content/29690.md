# Method and apparatus for linearization of a gas analyzer and valve manifold assembly for gas dosing.

## Abstract
A combustion analyzer, for example for the analysis of the carbon and sulphur content in steel. includes a gas flow system whereby a carrier gas flows through a combustion chamber 36 and gaseous products of combustion flow through one or more infrared cells 54, 60 for analysis. A method is described for the correction of the inherent non linearity of the measurement of concentration by the infrared cell or cells, and apparatus for performing the method is also described. Discrete levels of concentration of known gases are dosed into the system through flow resistors 83, 85 at varying pressures set by a pressure regulator 70 and the detected concentration measured by the infrared cells. Scal ing factors are determined by an iterative process employing a microprocessor which scaling factors are then employed to correct for the nonlinearity in sample measurements. The flow resistors and operating valves are mounted on a man ifold having short passages to maximise sensitivity.
