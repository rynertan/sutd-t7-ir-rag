## Description
HYDRAULIC SYSTEM AND HYDRAULIC FLUID COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING SILOXANE OXYALKYLENE COPOLYMERS Background of the Invention This invention concerns silicone copolymer fluids which are useful as hydraulic fluids, and particularly as automotive hydraulic fluids. More precisely, this invention concerns a hydraulic fluid which has a high boiling point and which contains, as a principal agent, a siloxane oxyalkylene copolymer which is compatible with water and with glycols. One of the conventional hydraulic fluids is a composition containing glycol ether as a base fluid which is used in the brake and clutch systems in automobiles.One of the drawbacks of the hydraulic fluid containing glycol ether as a base fluid is that the glycol ether absorbs moisture from the atmosphere due to its moisture absorbing character, causing reduction in the boiling point of the hydraulic fluid and of the vapor lock temperature. Needless to say, it is a serious drawback for the hydraulic fluid to lose one of its important characteristics. On the other hand, high speed operation of automobiles, brought about by improvements in the performance of automobiles and the expansion and maintenance of road networks, has made it imperative to improve automobile hydraulic fluids. Moreover, the enyironment around the brake fluid has increased in temperature due to the installation of exhaust control systems in automobiles. Thus brake fluid with a high boi ling point is in great demand. This property prevents the vapor lock phenomenon which occurs during high speed driving and during frequent brake use on long downhill roads.The recent establishment of DOT 5 specification that the boiling point of a brake fluid be 2600C or greater and the wet boiling point be l800C or greater Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and Regulations was aimed at production of brake fluid with a high boiling point. For this demand, the hydraulic fluid which contains glycol ether as a base is not satisfactory thus, various studies have been conducted and various hydraulic fluids have been disclosed. Although some of these satisfy the requirement of being high boiling point oils, they are not quite satisfactory when they are evaluated as hydraulic fluids. For example, there is a high boiling point hydraulic fluid using a special polyglycol ether as a starting oil. In this case, there is the drawback that the boiling point decreases easily when it absorbs moisture content from the atmosphere. In addition, a hydraulic fluid with low moisture absorbing character which contains a glycol ester as a base was also developed.However, this is more expensive than the hydraulic fluid which contains glycol ether as a base and is inferior, in terms of viscosity, to the hydraulic fluid which contains glycol ether as a base fluid. Consequently, many silicone type hydraulic fluids have recently been proposed. For example, the use of orthosilicate esters was disclosed in Kokai JapanesePatent No. Sho 49 1974 95925. Since orthosilicates do not exhibit satisfactory stability to hydrolysis, they cannot be used as hydraulic fluids for automobiles.Moreover, the use of amino silicones was proposed in U.S.Patent No. 3,725,287. However, these materials are relatively expensive and show relatively low wet boiling points, and thus the vapor lock phenomenon tends to occur in high moisture environments. In addition, silicone fluids which are useful as hydraulic fluids and which contain hydrocarbonoxy radicals have been disclosed inU.S. Patent Nos. 2,834,748 3,821,114 and 3,833,505.Silicone fluids containing ester functional radicals have been disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,830,744 3,859,321 and 4,088,591. As with the orthosilicate esters noted above silicone fluids containing hydrocarbonoxy radicals or ester functional radicals are also susceptible to hydrolysis to various degrees. Dimethyl silicone oil and phenylmethylsilicone oil are known as fluids with high boiling points and low moisture absorbing character.However, since these hydrocarbon silicone oils cause shrinkage of rubber parts of the hydraulic system which are in contact with the hydraulic fluid, the silicone oil may leak out. In addition, there is the drawback that the poor lubricating character of these silicone oils results in abrasion of the metal parts moving in the hydraulic system. For this reason, a silicone oil hydraulic fluid which is prepared by adding a rubber expanding agent and a lubrication improving agent to the silicone oils, was proposed in Japanese Patent No. Sho 53 1978 10102. The hydrocarbon silicone oil type hydraulic fluids have high boiling points, do not abosrb moisture from the atmosphere, exhibit less chemical modification at high temperatures, and minimal viscosity changes with temperature. Thus, they are very promising hydraulic fluids. However, these hydraulic fluids of silicone oil have the following two problems. One of these problems is that when water enters the hydraulic system for some reason, such as when the hydraulic system is washed with water or the hydraulic system is exposed to rainfall, the boiling point is decreased a great deal since the silicone oil is not at all compatible with water, and there is high risk of occurrence of vapor lock phenomena. The other problem is that the hydraulic fluid is not compatible with glycols.That is, if a glycol hydraulic fluid is replaced with a hydrocarbon silicon oil hydraulic fluid in the hydraulic system, the hydraulic system may contain two types of fluids, i.e. glycol hydraulic fluid and silicone oil hydraulic fluid, which are incompatible, thereby requiring that the glycol hydraulic fluid be completely removed. Otherwise, the excellent characteristics of the silicone oil hydraulic fluid are dissipated and the characteristics obtained are the same as those of the glycol hydraulic fluid. Brief Summary of the Invention It is an object of this invention to provide improved hydraulic fluid compositions. It is another object of this invention to provide hydraulic fluid compositions having the high boiling point performance of silicone hydraulic fluids. It is a further object of this invention to provide silicone hydraulic fluid compositions which are compatible with water and with glycol ether based hydraulic fluids. It is also an object of this invention to provide improved hydraulic systems comprising the hydraulic fluids of this invention. These objects, and others which will become obvious to one upon consideration of the following specification and appended claims, are obtained by incorporating certain siloxane oxyalkylene copolymers in a hydraulic fluid composition. Detailed Description of the Invention The present invention relates to a hydraulic fluid composition comprising from 1 to 100 percent by weight, based on the weight of the hydraulic fluid composition, of at least one siloxane oxyalkylene copolymer selected from the group consisting of I RÚRêR Si OSiRÚRêx OSiRÚRêR II GRÚRêSi OSiRÚRê x OSiRÚRêG, III RÚRêR Si OSiRÚRê x OSiRÚG zOSiRÚRêG,EMI5.1 IV OSiRÚRê x OSiRÚG y, V RaÚSi OSiRÚRê x OSiRÚG yOSiRÚRêR 4 a and VI RaÚSi OSiRÚRê x OSiRÚRêG 4 a wherein each RÚ and Rê denotes, independently, an alkyl radical, a halogen substituted alkyl radical or a phenyl radical each R denotes, independently, an alkyl radical, a halogen substituted alkyl radical, a phenyl radical, a hydroxyl radical or an alkoxy radical each G denotes, independently, a radical having the formula D OCnH2n mR4 wherein D denotes a divalent hydrocarbon radical and R denotes a hydroxyl radical or a monovalent organic radical and each subscript denotes a number such that a o or 1, n 2 to 10 inclusive, m 1 to 500 inclusive, x o to 500 inclusive, Y 1 to 500 inclusive and z 0 to 500 inclusive. The hydraulic fluid compositions of this invention are characterized by containing from 1 to 100 by weight, based on the weight of the composition, of the siloxane oxyalkylene copolymers delineated herein, and from 0 to 99 by weight of a fluid used in the art as a base fluid for hydraulic fluid compositions. The siloxane oxyalkylene copolymer component of the compositions of this invention, characterized by formulae I to VI, contains at least one silicon bonded oxyalkylene radical and from 2 to 1000, preferably 2 to 500 silicon atoms, per molecule. and R2 radicals of the siloxane oxyalkylene copolymer can be identical or different, as desired, and are selected from the group consisting of alkyl radicals having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, octyl and decyl halogenated alkyl radicals, such as 3,3,3 trifluoropropyl and phenyl. R and R2 are preferably methyl. R3 radicals can be any R1 or R2 radical denoted above or a hydroxyl radical or an alkoxy radical, such as OCH3, OCH2CH3, OCH CH3 2 or OC4H9. 3For maximum hydrolylic stability R is preferably selected from R1 and R2 radicals. The oxyalkylene radicals, denoted as G, have the formula D OCnH2n mR . The subscript n can have a value of from 2 to 10, inclusive, thereby providing for oxyalkylene segments having the formulae OCH2CH2 , OCH2CH2CH2 , OCH2CH CH3 , OCH2CH2CH2CH2 , OCH2CH2CH CH3 , OCH2CH CH3 CH2 , etc. The subscript m can have a value of from 1 to 500. When m has a value greater than 1, the multiple oxyalkylene segments may be the same or different, as desired. Preferred oxyalkylene segments are the well known oxyethylene segments and oxypropylene segments. The oxyalkylene radicals, G, are terminated by an R4 radical which can be a hydroxyl radical or an organic radical, such as alkoxy radicals having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, such as OCH3, OCH2CH3, OCH2CH2CH3 andOCH2CH2CH2CH3 acyloxy radicals, such as acetoxy or propionoxy aryloxy radicals, such as OC6H5 and other radicals, such as OCH2CH2CN. The selection of the R4 radical is not critical for the purposes of this invention. Each oxyalkylene radical, G, is bonded to a silicon atom of the siloxane oxyalkylene copolymer by a divalent hydrocarbon radical, D. Examples of D radicals include alkylene radicals having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, such as CH2CH2CH2CH2 , EMI7.1 A highly preferred G radical has the formula CH 134 D OCH2CH2 b OCH2CH CR wherein b has a value of from 0 to 100, c has a value of from 0 to 100 and the sum of b c has a value of from 1 to 200. As noted above, the type ofR4 radical is not critical but it is typically hydroxy, methoxy, butoxy or acetoxy in these highly preferred G radicals. Highly preferred siloxane oxyalkylene copolymers for use in the hydraulic fluid compositions of this invention are exemplified by the examples, hereinafter disclosed, and have the following formulae, wherein Me denotes the methyl radical Me3Si OSiMe2 x OSiMèG ySiMe3, GMe2Si OSiMe2 xOSiMe2G and MeSi OSiMe2 OSiMe2G 3 wherein G denotesEMI7.2 In these highly preferred copolymers D is preferably an alkylene radical. The siloxane oxyalkylene copolymers used in this invention include those having a viscosity sufficiently low to allow their use as the sole component of the hydraulic fluid compositions of this invention. Siloxane oxyalkylene copolymers delineated above which have higher viscosities may also be used in the hydraulic fluid compositions of this invention when they are mixed with lower viscosity materials such as polydimethylsiloxane oils, polyphenylmethylsiloxane oils and glycols. Of course, the lower viscosity siloxane oxyal kylene copolymers may also be mixed with said lower viscosity materials, if desired. This invention further includes the use of a mixture of other hydraulic fluids with 1 wtZ or greater of the siloxane oxyalkylene copolymer, rather than the sole use of siloxane oxyalkylene copolymers directly as a hydraulic fluid. Other suitable hydraulic fluids include the well known oxyalkylene polymer oils which are compatible with siloxane oxyalkylene copolymers, such as polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyethylenepropylene glycol and their various partially or fully capped analogs, such as methyl ether capped analogs, ethyl ether capped analogs and butyl ether capped analogs. Thus, it is within the scope of this invention to prepare a hydraulic fluid composition comprising from 1 to 99 by weight of the above delineated siloxane oxyalkylene copolymer and from 1 to 99 by weight of said oxyalkylene polymer oil which is compatible with said siloxane oxyalkylene copolymer. Moreover, if desirable, conventional hydraulic fluids or a variety of additives which are ordinarily added to the hydraulic fluids can be added to the hydraulic fluid of this invention which contain siloxane oxyalkylene copolymers as a principal component.Examples of these additives are as follows antioxidants such as 2,6 di tert butyl p cresol, p tert butylcresol and ss naphthylamine rust proofing agents such as benzotriazole agents to improve the oil character such as tricresyl phosphate, glycols, oils and fats and silicone oils of dimethyl series or phenylmethyl series. These additives can be added in arbitrary amounts as long as the purpose of this invention is not impaired. The present invention further relates to an improved hydraulic system comprising hydraulic activating means, hydraulic activated means, hydraulic line means connecting said activating means and said activated means and a hydraulically effective amount of a hydraulic fluid, the improvement comprising using, as said hydraulic fluid, a hydraulic fluid composition comprising from 1 to 100 percent by weight, based on the weight of the hydraulic fluid composition, of at lease one siloxane oxyalkylene copolymer selected from the group consisting of y I R1R2R3Si OSiR1R2 OSiR1G OSiR1R2R3 II GR1R2Si OSiR1R2 x OSiR1G zOSiR1R2G, EMI9.1 V R1 aSi OSiR1R2 R OSiR1G YOSiR1R2G 4 4 a and VI R1aSi OSiR1R2 x OSiR1G z OSiR1R2G 4 a wherein each R1 and R2 denotes, indpendently, an alkyl radical, a halogen substituted alkyl radical or a phenyl radical each R3 denotes, independently, an alkyl radical, a halogen substituted alkyl radical, a phenyl radical, a hydroxyl radical or an alkoxy radical each G denotes, independently, a radical having the formula D OCnH2n MR4 wherein D denotes a divalent hydrocarbon radical and R4 denotes a hydroxyl radical or a monovalent organic radical and each subscript denotes a number such that a o or 1, n 2 to 10 inclusive, m 1 to 500 inclusive, x 0 to 500 inclusive, Z 1 to 500 inclusive and z 0 to 500 inclusive. The improved hydraulic system of this invention has as its novel feature a hydraulically effective amount of the hydraulic fluid compositions of this invention.These hydraulic fluid compositions have been fully delineated above. In all other features the improved hydraulic systems of this invention are conventional and further comprise conventional hydraulic activating means, conventional hydraulic activated means and conventional hydraulic line means which connect said activating and said activated means to permit fluid contact between said activating and said activated means. Being thus conventional in all features, except the hydraulic fluid contained therein, the improved hydraulic systems of this invention need no further delineation beyond the above disclosed full delineation of said hydraulic fluid. In a preferred embodiment of this invention the improved hydraulic system comprising the novel hydraulic fluid of this invention is an automotive hydraulic brake system comprising, as the activating means, the necessary piston containing cylinder s and necessary connecting means to permit an operator of the brake system to apply a braking force to the system as the activated means, the necessary piston containing cylinder s and necessary connecting means to transfer the braking force to brake shoe s and brake drum s and or brake disc s and brake rotor s , and as hydraulic line means, the necessary rigid and or flexible tubes to permit fluid communication between said activating means and said activated means.The automotive brake system can further comprise conventional components such as a fluid reservoir, valves, and engine operated pressure generating means.
