When the lead pins or outer leads 6 of the electronic parts 5 are dipped by solder, or cleaned and dried after the solder dipping, a plurality of electronic parts 5 should be clamped for transporting or handling. or clamping the electronic parts 5, the inventor perceived to the outer periphery, especially both ends 7 of the electronic parts 5 where no lead pins 6 are provided, as the objective position of the clamping by the clamping apparatus, and perfected the present invention. Namely, clamping of a plurality of dual pin type electronic parts 5 is performed by holding the both ends 7 of the electronic parts 5 by a pair of chuck members or chuck nail plates 8 of the clamping apparatus. As the result, it is possible to clamp the electronic part 5 without giving damages to the lead pins 6 which are important portions of the electronic part 5. The clamping apparatus of the present invention which claps, for example, above mentioned dual pin type electronic parts 5 includes, as described above, two parallel arms supported by bearings and correlated to opening and closing means, and at least one pair of chuck members 8 attached to the underside of the arms directly or via a mounting member, the chuck member 8 can clamp both ends of the dual pin type electronic part and preferably made of resilient or flexible materials. This clamping apparatus is mounted on the position for handling the dual pin type electronic parts 5, for example, on the rotary table of an automatic solder dipping system. In the clamping apparatus, by operating the above described opening and closing means, for example, a tension spring and arm rotating means which rotate two parallel arms outwardly or inwardly by a predetermined angle at the same time, the chuck members 8 mounted to the underside of the arms are opened or closed. When the chuck arms 8 are closed, the both ends 7 of the dual pin type electronic parts 5 are clamped between the lower ends of the chuck members 8. The clamping apparatus can clamp and handle automatically a plurality of dual pin type electronic part at a time in order to transport them to the upward and downward directions or right and left directions in accordance with the object to which the clamping apparatus is mounted. Figs. 4 6 show one embodiment of the clamping apparatus according to the present invention. In this clamping apparatus shown in these figures, the front and the base ends of two parallel clamp shafts 9 are respectively journaled by bearings 10 and 10a, and a mounting portion 11 is fixed to the front projecting portion and other suitable positions. A pair of chuck mounting rods 12 are provided to the lower end of the mounting portion 11 in parallel relation to the clamp shafts 9. The both ends of the mounting rods 12 are pulled each other by means of each tension spring 13, namely, both of the clamp shafts 9 are energized to rotate inwardly. A pair of gears 14 are mounted on the clamp shafts 9 at the positions projected from the bearing 10a situated at the base ends of the clamp shafts 9, and these gears 14 mesh with each other so that both of the clamp shafts 9 can rotate synchronously.Further, a rotating lever 15 projects towards side direction from one of the clamp shafts 9, and there is provided a lifting device for pushing the lever 15 from the lower position to the upper position, for example, an elevating rod 16 which moves upwardly by a cylinder. To the underside of the chuck mounting rod 12 having the above driving mechanism, a plurality of chuck members or chuck nail plates 8 which are made of resilient materials such as spring plates or rubber plates etc. are provided in parallel relation. In this arrangement, when the lever 15 of one of the clamp shafts 9 is pushed upwardly by actuating the lifting device 16, each of the two clamp shafts 9 is rotated in the direction shown by arrows a in Fig. 6 to open the chuck members 8 against the tension of the springs 13, and when the actuation of the lifting device 16 is stopped, the chuck members 8 are closed by the tension of the springs 13. Therefore, if the dual pin type electronic parts were positioned between the chuck members in the opened condition, it is possible to clamp and handle a plurality of the electronic parts at one time. The reference numeral 17 in the drawing shows an object to which one of the bearings, for example,the bearing 10a is mounted. The present clamping apparatus is operated in accordance with the motion of the object 17 so as to handle the dual pin type electronic parts at respective processing stations.

Onto the upper side of the carriers 19, the dual pin type electronic parts can be mounted. It is possible to handle a plurality of dual pin type electronic parts feeded in line by clamping the end faces of the electronic parts by means of the chuck members 8 of the above described clamping apparatus. Then, an example in which the clamping apparatus of the present invention is applied to the solder dipping treatment is described hereinafter. Fig. 8 shows a diagrammatic view of one example of an automatic solder dipping system for dipping solder to the lead pins of dual pin type electronic parts. In this system, a plurality of dual pin type electronic parts fed from a feeding tray 30 are arranged in line at the transporting step etc. and are fed to the feeding station 31. The electronic parts fed successively are transported to the automatic solder dipping system, in which etching tanks 32, 33, a cleaning tank 34, a flux dipping tank 35, a solder dipping tank 36, and a reserve tank not shown are arranged in a concentric circle. At the center of tanks, there is provided a rotary shaft R which is correlated to a drive mechanism such as a motor etc. To the rotary shaft R, the clamping apparatusC of the present invention is connected via a table in correspondence with the arrangement of the above tanks, for example, in the embodiment shown in Fig. 4, the bearing positioned at the base end is connected. The clamping apparatus C is rotated by a predetermined angle by means of the rotation of the rotary shaft R in order to feed the dual pin type electronic parts successively, and the electronic parts are treated by the solder dipping tank 36 etc. correlated to the lifting device at each processing station and elevated by a predetermined height. After the solder dipping is completed, the electronic parts are fed to a discharge device 37, from which transported and cleaned via cleaner tanks 38, 39, 40 and dried by means of dryer tanks 41, 42, and collected in a tray 43. As the feeding of the dual pin type electronic parts described above is performed in accordance with the operation of the clamping apparatus of the present invention, when the clamping apparatus is used in the automatic assembling process etc., it is possible to feed the dual pin type electronic parts so that they can be mounted in line. As described above, the clamping apparatus of the present invention includes the chuck members which can clamp a plurality of dual pin type electronic parts in relation with the opening and closing means to hold and handle them in line for feeding, the clamping apparatus can be used as beneficial automatic feeding and handling means when various treatments such as automatic solder dipping are performed on the dual pin type electronic parts.
