It is preferred for n1 to be 2, and for each Y to be selected from fluoro, chloro and methyl. For example Y 1 may advantageously be 3,4 dichloro, 3 chloro 4 fluoro or 2,6 dimethyl. Mary of the compounds of formula III are known as herbicides, e.g. ethyl N benzoyl N 3, dichlorophenyl 2 aminopropionate benzoylprop ethyl and isopropyl N benzoyl N 3 chloro O fluorophenyl 2 aminopropionate flamprop isopropyl , and may be prepared as described in rJK Patent Specification No. 1,164,160 or W. German O.S. No. 2650434, or are known as fungicides, e.g. methyl N methoxyacetyl N 2,6 dimethylphenyl 2 aminopropionate, and may be prepared as described in UK Patent Specification No.1,500,581, or the compounds of formula III may be prepared by analogous methods to those described in UK Patent SpecificationsNos. 1,164,160 and 1,500,5O1 and W. German O.S. No. 265034. The amino acid compounds of formula III have a surprising synergistic effect on the pesticidal activity of the pyrethroid insecticides of formula I, particularly with respect to dipterous insects, e.g. houseflies and sheep blowfly. Such mixtures are thus of considerable potential utility in the domestic, agrochemical and animal health fields. The weight ratio of pyrethroid insecticide of formula I to VC amino acid of formula III will normally be in the range 5 1 to 1 50. The pesticidal composition according to the invention preferably also comprises a carrier, especially at least two carriers, at least one of which is a surface active agent. A carrier may be a solid or liquid material, which may be inorganic or organic and of synthetic or natural origin. Typical solid carriers include natural and synthetic clays and silicates, for example, natural silicas, for example diatomaceous earths, and aluminium silicates, for example kaolinites, montmorillonites and micas. Typical liquid carriers are ketones, for example methylcyclohexanone, aromatic hydrocarbons, for example methylnaphthalenes, petroleum fractions, for example petroleum xylenes and light mineral oils, and chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example carbon tetrachloride. Mixtures of liquids are often suitable. One or more surface active agents and or stickers can be included in the composition. A surface active agent may be an emulsifying agent or a dispersing agent or a wetting agent it may be non ionic or ionic. Any of the surface active agents usually applied in formulating insecticides may be used. Examples of suitable surface active agents are the sodium and calcium salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sulphonic acids the condensation products of fatty acids of aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitol, sucrose or pentaerythritol, condensates of these with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide condensation products of fatty alcohols or alkyl phenols, for example poctylphenol or p octylcresol, with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide sulphates or sulphonates of these condensation products alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, preferably sodium salts, of sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters containing at least 10 carbon atoms in the molecule, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium secondary alkyl sulphates, sodium salts of sulphonated castor oil, and sodium alkylaryl sulphonates, such as sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate and polymers of ethylene oxide and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The composition of the invention may for example be formulated as a wettable powder, microcapsules, a dust, granules, a solution, an emulsifiable concentrate, an emulsion, a suspension concentrate or an aerosol. The composition may have controlled release properties, or may be suitable for use as a bait. Wettable powders usually contain 25, 50 or 75 w of active ingredient and may contain, in addition to inert solid material, 3 10 w of a dispersing agent and, where necessary, 0 10 w of a stabiliser, a penetrant and or a stickler. A dust is usually formulated as a dust concentrate having a composition similar to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and is diluted in the field with further solid carrier to give a composition usually containing 2 10 w of active ingredient. Granules usually have a size in the range of from 10 to 100 BS mesh 1.676 0.152 mm and may be manufactured by agglomeration or impregnation techniques. Generally, granules will contain 2 25, e1 w active ingredient and 0 10 w of additives, for example a stabiliser, slow release modifier and or a binding agent. Emulsifiable concentrates usually contain, in addition to a solvent, and, when necessary, co solvent, 10 50 w active ingredient, 2 20 w v emulsifier and 0 20 w v of other additives, for example a stabiliser, a penetrant and or a corrosion inhibitor.A suspension concentrate is a stable, non sedimenting, flowable product and usually contains 10 75 w active ingredient, 0.5 15 w of dispersing agent, 0.1 10 w of suspending agent, for example protective colloid and or a thixotropic agent, and 0 10 w of other additives including, for example, a defoamer, a corrosion inhibitor, a stabiliser, a penetrant and or a sticker, and as dispersant, water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is substantially insoluble certain organic additives and or inorganic salts may be dissolved in the dispersant to assist in preventing sedimentation or as anti freeze for water. The aqueous dispersions and emulsions formed by diluting a wettable powder or an emulsifiable concentrate of the invention with water, also lie within the scope of the present invention.Such dispersions and emulsions may be of the water in oil or of the oil in water type, and may have a thick mayonnaise like consistency. A composition of the invention may also contain other ingredients, for example, one or more other compounds possessing pesticidal, herbicidal or fungicidal properties, or attractants, for example pheromones or food ingredients, for use in baits and trap formulations. The invention also includes a method of combating pests at a locus characterised in that a pesticidal composition according to the invention is applied to the locus. The invention will be further understood from the following examples which illustrate the usefulness of the invention. The compounds of formula II employed in the tests had negligible insecticidal activity but acted as synergists in enhancing the performance of the various compounds of formula I. Activity tests against housefly Mus a domestica were effected by the following procedure. The LD s the lethal 50 dose of compound of formula I to kill 50ras of the insects were calculated by employing a series of acetone solutions of the compounds of formula I alone and with compounds of formula II at varying concentrations. Two to three day old adult female houseflies Musca domestica were anaesthetised with carbon dioxide, and I jil of the test solution was applied by means of a micrometer syringe to the ventral side of the abdomen of each fly, 20 flies being tested. The treated flies were heid in glass jars covered with paper tissue held by an elastic band. Cotton wool pads soaked in dilute sugar solution were placed on top of the tissue as food. After 24 hours the percentage of dead and moribund flies were recorded for each test. From these results the LD50 S in micrograms of active material and hence synergist ratios were calculated.
