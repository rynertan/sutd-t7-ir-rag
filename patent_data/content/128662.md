# SAFETY BELT

## Abstract
A safety belt S has a continuous webbing W composed of a shoulder side outer webbing piece W1 extending from an upper strengthening member 5 at the side of an automotive body for restricting the breast of an occupant sitting on a seat and a lap side outer webbing piece W2 exending from a lower strengthening member A at the side of the body for restricting the waist of the occupant. The continuous webbing has at least one annularly folded portion 1 10 which is formed in the continuous webbing W and has a plurality of U shaped sewing patterns 4 separately sewn adjacent to each other in the folded portion. This construction enables the stretching characteristics of the shoulder and lap side outer webbing pieces of the continuous webbing to be formed different from one another to provide buffer and energy absorbing functions of the continuous webbing W , thereby further improving the performance of a conventional safety belt.
