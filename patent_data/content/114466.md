# Improvements in or relating to DC to DC converters.

## Abstract
A DC to DC converter is operated at high frequency in the radio frequency spectrum to utilize adjunct reactive impedances 243, 271 of the active semiconductor devices 240, 270 as part of an impedance transformation circuit 231,232,234,235 . Power is transferred through the conver ter at substantially a single frequency. Energy storage of the adjunct reactances is positively utilized to limit power dissipation within the converter.
