# Dipstick.

## Abstract
A dipstick is formed of a single length of wire and com prises a generally straight main body 32 and a loop shaped handle portion 34 . The wire is circular in cross section, rela tively small in diameter and possesses a relatively high resi lience such that the main body 32 can resiliently flex in all directions to follow a complexly curved dipstick guiding conduit 36 . The main body 32 has a pair of axially spaced and radially projected stopper portions 32a,, 32b . The handle portion 34 extends from the main body 32 and terminates in an end 34a which is wound round the main body 32 between the stopper portions 32a,, 32b such that the end 34a of the handle portion 34 is prevented from relative movement in the axial direction of the main body 32 .
