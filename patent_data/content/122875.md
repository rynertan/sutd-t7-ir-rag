# Electrode of an electric arc furnace.

## Abstract
An electrode for electric arc furnaces, comrpising a water cooled metallic electrode holder 1 and a consumable section 3 connected to the electrode holder by means of a threaded nipple 2 the electrode holder having a protective jacket made up of rings 4, 5, 10, 20 . Between the consumable section 3 and the electrode holder 1 there is a disk 11, 19 which, in the event of a fracture of the consumable section 3 , remains attached to the electrode holder 1 , thus protecting it against the electric arc. The disk 11, 19 may be attached to the electrode holder 1 in various ways. E.g., the lowest ring 10, 20 of the protective jacket may have the form of a sleeve nut, its bottom being represented by the disk 11, 19 which lies between the electrode holder 1 and the consumable section 3 , or the electrode holder 1 may have thorns 23 which enter the disk 11 when the consumable section is screwed on, thus retaining said disk 11 . The sleeve nut shaped protective member may constitute one solid piece or consist of two separate parts.
