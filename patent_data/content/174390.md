## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING CURED EPOXY RESIN SPHERICAL PARTICLES This invention relates to a process for producing cured epoxy resin spherical particles. More particularly, it relates to a process for producing spherical particles of cured epoxy resin having an average particle size not larger than 50 pm, which comprises adding an amine curing agent to a previously prepared emulsion of an uncured epoxy compound. Japanese Patent Publication No. 42360 1978 teaches a method of producing fine particles of epoxy resin, in which a mixture of an epoxy compound having at least two epoxide groups in the molecule and a curing agent for epoxy resin is treated, in the presence or absence of a solvent or diluent for epoxy resin, in a dispersion medium in which said epoxy compound is insoluble or sparingly soluble, such as water and n hexane, to form spherical particles of cured product. More precisely, a compound having at least two epoxide groups in the molecule is precured by the action of a curing agent in the presence or absence of a solvent or diluent for epoxy resin, and the precured product thus obtained is dispersed with stirring in water or n hexane containing a surface active agent or a water soluble polymer that serves as a protective colloid, followed by heating of the resulting dispersion to ensure complete cure. However, the size of particles obtained by this technique is generally large, and it is difficult to achieve a particle size less than 50 vm. A primary object of this invention is to offer a process for producing spherical particles of cured epoxy resin having a particle size not larger than 50 Vm. A second object of this invention is to offer a process for producing spherical particles of cured epoxy resin, which comprises adding a water soluble amine to a previously prepared aqueous emulsion of an uncured epoxy compound. A third object of this invention is to offer a process for producing fine par ticles of epoxy resin in which an ultraviolet absorber or other compound bearing a functional group capable of reacting with epoxide group is chemically combined. A fourth object of this invention is to offer a process for producing fine particles of epoxy resin with an ultraviolet absorber, or inorganic or organic particles, mixed therein.A fifth object of this invention is to provide a process for producing fine particles of epoxy resin colored with a dye or subjected to electroless plating. A sixth object of this invention is to provide a process for producing fine particles of epoxy resin that can be used as an ingredient for cosmetic products, surface coatings and plastics, as a toner for electrostatic copiers, or for other purposes. These objects can be achieved by emulsifying an uncured epoxy compound in water in the presence of a surface active agent, followed by addition of a watersoluble amine to the resulting emulsion, thereby forming cured epoxy resin spherical particles having an average particle size not larger than 50 pm. The uncured epoxy compound used for the process of this invention should preferably be the one composed mainly of a compound having at least two epoxide groups in the molecule. Uncured epoxy compounds commonly used as adhesives satisfy this requirement.Typical examples include the following. As compounds having two epoxide groups in the molecule may be mentioned, among others, bisphenol A type diglycidyl ether, polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ethers, polypropylene glycol diglycidyl ethers, neopentyl glycol diglycidyl ether, 1,6 hexanediol diglycidyl ether, bisphenol H type diglycidyl ether, and diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol alkylene oxide adducts. As compounds having three or more epoxide groups in the molecule may be mentioned, among others, glycerol triglycidyl ether, trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether, polyglycidyl ethers of phenol novolak type compounds, trisepoxypropyl isocyanurate, N,N,N ,N tetraglycidyl m xylylenediamine, and 1,3 bis N,N diglycidylaminomethyl cyclohexane. Of these, bisphenol A type glycidyl ether, bisphenol H type glycidyl ether and polyglycidyl ethers or phenol novolak type compounds are likely to give spherical particles and are therefore more advantageous for the purpose of this invention. The uncured epoxy compound used in this invention should preferably be the one which contains compound having at least two epoxide groups in the molecule as described above in an amount of 50 to 100 by weight, alone or in combination. The uncured epoxide compound of this invention may contain a compound having one epoxide group in the molecule in an amount not larger than 50 by weight.As examples of such compounds may be mentioned, among others, monoglycidyl ethers of aliphatic alcohols, such as 2 ethylhexyl glycidyl ether and 2 methyloctyl glycidyl ether, and monoglycidyl ethers of phenols, such as phenyl glycidyl ether. The compounds having one epoxide group in the molecule may also contain an ethylenic double bond. If the amount of the compound having one epoxide group in the molecule exceeds 50 by weight, sufficient polymerization or cross linking may not be achieved in the curing step, resulting in the formation of particles with low mechanical strength or of tacky particles. The compound having at least two epoxide groups used in this invention may also be a chemically modified product thereof, in which another compound having a functional group capable of reacting with the epoxide group has been chemically combined. Such compounds that can chemically modify epoxy compounds include those containing alcoholic hydroxyl, mercapto, phenolic hydroxyl, carboxyl, and primary or secondary amino groups, sodium bisulfite, hydrogen halides, nitric acid and water, which may be properly selected depending on the intended purpose of modification imparting the final particles with ultraviolet absorptive power, etc. . Reaction with the epoxide group can be effected under conditions commonly employed. When an alcoholic hydroxyl, phenolic hydroxyl, carboxyl or amino group is used for modification, the reaction is carried out preferably at 1000 C or higher temperatures. Addition of a catalyst, such as a tertiary amine, is favorable in some cases, for example, in the reaction of alcoholic hydroxyl group. Presence of sulfuric acid or other suitable capalyst is preferable when water is used for modification. Typical examples of the compounds that can be used for modification of the epoxy compounds used for the process of this invention include dyes containing phenolic hydroxyl or amino group for the preparation of colored particles which are fast to water and other solvens 4 aminofluorescein suitable for producing fluorescent particles aminosilanes used to render the particles oleophilic and p aminobenzoic acid and its derivatives, and benzophenone compounds having phenolic hydroxyl group, ewhich are used for the preparation of powdery ultraviolet absorbers. As a result of chemical modification described above, the epoxide.groups in the molecule will be partly or wholly lost. If all the epoxide groups are modified, the resultant molecule lacks in ability of reacting with the curing agent in the subsequent step, remaining in the form of a low molecular weight substance. Presence of such low molecular.substances in the final particles is unfavorable because of possible elution and other troubles. To minimize such disadvantages it is preferable, when all the epoxide groups in the molecule are to be modified, to use a compound having at least two epoxide groups, and to employ, as a modifier, a compound having a plurality of group capable of reacting with epoxide group or a plurality of active hydrogens, thereby increasing the molecular weight of the resulting reaction product.It is needless to say that such considerations are unnecessary when only part of the epoxide groups in the molecule is chemically modified. When preparing the aqueous emulsion of uncured epoxy compound in the process of this invention, the modified epoxy compound as described above may be contained in an amount not larger than about 40 based on the weight of the compound having at least two epoxide groups in the molecule. If the amount exceeds this level, it is often difficult to obtain cured particles in spherical form or the formed particles will be tacky in some cases. The modified epoxy compound can be added in an amount as defined above by.several ways for example, by direct reaction of a predetermined amount of modifier with the compound having at least two epoxide groups, or by adding a necessary amount of modified epoxy compound previously prepared. This invention also involves a method in which other inorganic or organic particles which will serve various purposes are incorporated in the particles of uncured epoxy resin emulsion, thereby producing cured epoxy compound spherical particles containing such particles. This method will be detailed below. The inorganic or organic particles to be incorporated are uniformly dispersed in the epoxy compound before emulsification. Typical examples of inorganic particles include inorganic pigment, such as titanium dioxide, calcium carbonate, ferrite, chromium hydroxide, talc, clay, silica and zinc oxide, water insoluble metal oxides, metal sulfides, salts insoluble in water, and carbon black. The organic particles include organic pigment of phthalocyanine and azo types, and oil soluble dyes which are insoluble in water. The surface of these particles should preferably be oleophilic rather than hydrophlic, because higher affinity with the epoxy compound ensures easier dispersion. It is preferred that the size of these inorganic or organic particles is less than the average size of the fine particles of cured epoxy resin of this invention. The size should preferably be less than half of the size of intended epoxy resin particles, and more preferably less than 0.5 m. Although there is no limitation on the amount of these inorganic or organic particles, it is preferable to use in an amount not larger than 300 based on the weight of epoxy compound. If the amount exceeds this level, much of the added particles will get out of the emulsion particles in the emulsification and curing steps. The fine particles of cured epoxy resin of this invention may contain other additives in an amount not to defeat the intended purpose of the invention. One example is ultraviolet absorbers, of which p aminobenzoic acid, n butyl p aminobenzoate, 2,4dihydroxybenzophenone and 2 2 hydroxy 5 methylphenyl 2H benzotriazole are preferably used. p Aminobenzoic acid, which is solid at normal temperature, is preferably applied to the epoxy compound in the form of solution in ethanol or acetone, followed by removal of the solvent by vacuum evaporation or other method. n Butyl p aminobenzoate, 2,4 dihydroxybenzophenone and 2 2 hydroxy 5 methylphenyl 2H benzotriazole, which melt at relatively low temperatures, can be dissolved in the epoxide compound by intimate mixing and subsequent heating. The preferable amount of these ultraviolet absorbers is less than 40 based on the weight of the compound having at least two epoxide groups in the molecule. Other additives that may be used include antistatic agents, electroconductive agents and blowing agents, which are normally added to the epoxide compound before or during emulsification. In the process of this invention the uncured epoxy resin must be emulsified in water in the presence of a surface active agent. Any types of surface active agents may be used for this purpose, but use of an emulsifier having an RLB value not lower than 12 is preferable. Typical examples include ether type nonionic surface active agents, such as polyoxyethylene phenol ethers and polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block polyethers, ester type nonionic surface active agents, such as polyethylene glycol higher fatty acid esters, and fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols, and alkoxylated rosins. Polyamideamines which are of the self emulsifiable type and can serve as a curing agent for epoxy compounds, such as reaction products between dimer acids and polyetherdiamines or aliphatic polyamines, may also be used advantageously. These surface active agents are preferably added in an amount more than 5t, more preferably morethan 10 , based on the weight of epoxy compound. If the amount of emulsifier added is smaller, the stability of the uncured epoxy resin emulsion will be lower, failing to give satisfactory cured resin particles in some cases.There is no upper limit for the amount of surface active agent used, but it is generally preferable that the amount does not exceed 30 based on the weight of epoxy compound to obtain cured resin particles with satisfactory mechanical properties. The ease with which a liquid is emulsified is generally dependent upon its viscosity it is difficult to emulsify a highly viscous epoxy compound or a solid type epoxy compound by mechanical force alone. In such cases, use of a solvent for epoxy compound together with a surface active agent is advisable. Typical solvents which may be used for this purpose include ketones, alcohols, Cellosolve solvents, 1,4 dioxane, aromatic hydrocarbons, and esters such as ethyl acetate. In the process of this invention, the epoxy compound is emulsified in usual ways by the aid of a surface active agent as mentioned above in the presence of a solvent as required. A typical method of emulsification will be described below. An epoxy compound containing a surface active agent is agitated at a high speed while being maintained at a temperature in the range from normal temperature to 950 C, and water heated to the same temperature as above is slowly added. It is generally preferable to add the water intermittently, rather than continuously.A w o type emulsion is first formed by this method, which is then converted to an o w type emulsion through phase conversion. High speed agitation is recommended during and after phase conversion to obtain a stable and uniform emulsion with small particle size. The particle size and stability of epoxy resin emulsion is closely correlated to emulsion concentration.Too low a concentration tends to poor stability, resulting in coagulation. A general notion is that concentration should be in the range of 10 to 80 by weight to obtain a satisfactory emulsion. However, the process of this invention specifies no such limitation. The epoxy compound emulsion prepared by the method described above is stabilized by the action of the surface active agent added, but it is effective in further enhancing emulsion stability to add, in advance, in the water used for emulsification a substance which behaves as a protective colloid, such as hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, gum arabic and polyvinyl alcohol. Any water soluble amines may be used as the curing agent in the process of this invention. However, it is preferable to employ such an amine as to give a cured product having a Shore A hardness not lower than 70 when it is mixed with the epoxy compound being used in equivalent quantities and the mixture is allowed to stand at normal temperature about 200 C for eight hours.Such water soluble amines include, among others, piperazine derivatives, hydrazine derivatives, polyalkylenepolyamines such as ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine and triethylenetetramine, alcoholamines such as ethanolamine, N 2 aminoethyl piperazine, and m xylylenediamine. Particularly preferred amines are the piperazine derivatives represented by the following general formula I and hydrazine derivatives represented by the following general formula II EMI13.1 wherein R and R are each hydrogen or an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms EMI13.2 wherein R is hydrogen, an alkyl of 1 to 5 carbon atoms, phenyl, or 2 hydroxyethyl group . The suitable amount of the water soluble amine may vary depending on its type, but more than 0.15 equivalent, relative to the epoxide group, is generally preferable. For piperazine, it is preferably more than 0.15 equivalent, more preferably 0.2 equivalent or more for hydrazine, it is preferably 0.2 equivalent or larger, more preferably 0.25 equivalent or larger and for other water soluble amines, it is preferably 0.5 equivalent or larger, more preferably 0.6 equivalent or larger. The upper limit for the amount of curing agent is not specified in this invention. However, an amount not larger than 4 equivalent is generally preferable because emulsion stability tends to lower with increasing amount of curing agent. Generally, the amine curing agent is directly added to the emulsion of uncured epoxy compound in the process of this invention. But it may also be added in the form of solution in water, alcohol or other watersoluble solvent. The concentration of emulsion to be submitted to the curing step is not specified in this invention, but is preferably higher than 5 by weight to ensure its stability. Too high a concentration, however, tends to cause coagulation during curing due to increased chances of collision among particles. Hence it is preferable that the emulsion concentration does not exceed 80 by weight. The reaction between an epoxy compound and its curing agent is generally exothermic, which is favorable in that the heat evolved helps increase the reaction rate. However, since elevated temperature tends.to adversely affect the stability of emulsion under curing, it is preferable that the temperature is held below 70 C by external cooling for some time after addition of the curing agent. It is also advisable in some cases to add the curing agent in small portions continuously or intermittently. The temperature may be raised to 700 C or higher in the later stage of reaction to ensure complete cure. While curing is in progress, the emulsion should preferably be allowed to stand undisturbed or held with mild stirring to obtain satisfactory cured particles. Although depending on the extent of cure, the cured particles thus obtained may sometimes be unsatisfactory in resistance to heat and solvents. This is probably due to the fact that, in the process of this invention, curing progresses heterogeneously from the surface of each particle, which makes it difficult to put curing reaction to completion in some cases. When an amine having two active hydrogen atoms is combined with a bifunctional epoxy compound, a cured product of linear structure is likely to be formed, which may not be absolutely satisfactory for some end uses in which high resistance to heat or solvents is required. The cured epoxy resin spherical particles of this invention may be after treated as described below to meet special requirements for certain of their end uses. The cured particles can be heated at temperatures of 400 C or higher, more preferably at temperatures of 500 C or higher, to improve their resistance to heat and solvents. Although there is no upper limit for the heating temperature, it is generally preferable to heat them at temperatures below 2000 C. Any known heating methods may be used for this purpose. Listed below are typical processes, in which cured particles mean the particles which have been cured to such an extent that sticking of one particle to another does not occur at normal temperature. 1 Heating the emulsion containing both cured particles and unreacted curing agent. 2 Separating cured particles from the emulsion, redispersing them in water or an inert solvent, and heating the resulting dispersion. 3 Separating cured particles from the emulsion, and heating them in the subsequent drying step or after drying. When the redispersed particles are heattreated, redispersion should be complete to prevent particle coalescence. When the heat treatment is performed at temperatures higher than 500 C, it is often preferable to raise the temperature in steps in order to avoid particle coalescence. There is no limitation on the heat treatment time normally, heating should be continued until intended resistance to heat and solvents is achieved. The treating time can generally be reduced by adopting higher treating temperature. The curing reaction in the process of this invention presumably proceeds from the surface of each particle in the emulsion. Since the molecules of curing agent dissolved in the liquid phase gradually permeate inside each particle through its surface, long time is required until all the molecules of epoxy compounds are completely cured. The rate of permeation and reaction of curing agent can be increased by raising the temperature of the system in the middle or final stage of reaction, but nevertheless unreacted epoxide groups are likely to remain at the center of each particle. These epoxide groups left unreacted even in the final stage of curing can be destroyed by treating the spherical particles with an aqueous solution of acidic substance before or after drying. Typical examples of the acidic substances used for this purpose include inorganic acids such as sulfuric, hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric and perchloric acids, acidic salts such as aluminum sulfate and chloride, and carboxylic acids such as formic and acetic acids. The required amount of these acidic substances may be very small because they serve as a catalyst for the reaction of water with epoxide groups, but the reaction can be put to completion in shorter time when a larger amount is added. The aqueous solution used for this acid treatment may also contain a water miscible solvent, such as 1,4 dioxane, ethanol, methanol, MethylCellosolve, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and tetrahydrofuran. The amount of water does not matter so long as it is larger than the stoichiometric quantity. The above mentioned treatment is preferably carried out by mixing the slurry of particles, or dried particles, with an acidic solution and thoroughly agitating the mixture. The suitable amount of the acidic substance to be used in this treatment may vary depending on the amount of residual epoxide groups and the end use of spherical epoxy resin particles, but is normally in the range of 0.001 to 1 mole per gram of the particles. The fine particles of cured epoxy resin of this invention can be used as an ingredient of cosmetic and other compositions and coloring their surfaces is often demanded in such applications. The particles of this invention are readily dyeable. Methods of dyeing are described below. The particles to be dyed may be those which have been subjected to heat treatment for improving thermal resistance or to acid treatment for destroying residual epoxide groups, or those not subjected to such treatments. When the particles are dry, they are dispersed in a liquid capable of dissolving or finely dispersing the dye to be applied, such as water and alcohols. Use of a small amount of surface active agent is effective in ensuring satisfactory dispersion in many cases.Intended dispersion can be achieved in shorter time if a dispersing device, such as a homogenizer, is useS.Dyeing of the particles can be effected by nearly the same method as dyeing of textiles under nearly the same conditions. Any dyes reacting with amino or hydroxyl groups as active sites may be used for this purpose, including oil soluble dyes. Of these, acid dyes and reactive dyes are particularly preferable, which give colored products difficult to decolorize by water and organic solvents. Unlike textile dyeing, collection of colored products from the dye liquor is not so easy, but this can be effected by filtration or centrifugal separation. All the particles must be discrete from one another during dyeing operation. If coalescence occurs in a certain degree, the internal part of the aggregates will be difficult to dye. In general, wet particles which have not been dried are easier to disperse, and high degree of redispersion can be achieved by simple methods. When an acid dye is used, the pH of dye liquor must be kept below 7. A slightly larger amount of an acid such as sulfuric or acetic acid should be used in the case of the particles of this invention because of the amino groups contained. Use of an acid dye, though depending on dyeing conditions, has an additional advantage that the unreacted epoxlde groups left inside the particles may be destroyed by the catalytic action of hydrogen ion. Dyed particles are separated from dye liquor by filtration or other suitable method, and washed.When an acid dye is used, the dyed particles contain sulfuric, acetic or other acid, which should be neutralized by adding ammonia or other alkali to the dye liquor before filtration or to the redispersing liquor after filtration. The ammonia or other alkali must be added slowly not to cause unusual rise of pH at any moment. A pH value higher than 7 can release the fixed acid dye from the particles. Means of improving color fastness commonly used in textile dyeing, such as tannic acid treatment in acid dyeing, can be applied to the dyeing of the particles of this invention. The colored epoxy resin particles thus obtained have high color fastness when used as an ingredient of cosmetics, for example, there is no danger of the released dye staining the skin. The spherical particles of epoxy resin, which have been cured and subjected to heat treatment, acid treatment or dyeing, can be recovered in the form of powder after separation from water by filtration or cNentrifugation. Slight particle coalescence may occur during curing in some cases. If this happens, treatment of the slurry with a homogenizer or mixer equipped with high speed rotary blades will readily restore good dispersion. The cake of fine particles thus obtained is dried in air or by heating, giving dry particles. When the particle size is very small or the wet cake has a high moisture content, coagulation is likely to occur, some times requiring slight milling after drying. Fine particles of cured epoxy resin can be produced by the process of this invention in a spherical or nearly spherical form having an average particle size not larger than 50 pm. The lower limit of size, though not specified, is normally 0.1 pm or larger. The inorganic or organic particles, when formulated, are contained in the surface or inner layer of each particle. Most commonly, most of these particles are present in the surface layer. In such cases, slight unevenness is often observed on the surface, but these particles are fixed to the cured epoxy resin inside. The cured epoxy resin particles of this invention can be used as a component of pressuresensitive, conductive rubber and conductive adhesives, and the surface of each particle must be given electroconductivity for such applications. The surface of the particle of this invention can be subjected to electroless plating. This treatment is normally carried out using a slurry of dry resin particles redispersed in water or a slurry of wet resin particles redispersed in water after filtration and washing. The latter type of slurry, in which all the particles remain discrete from one another, is more preferable, which is likely to give spherical particles after plating, with less tendency of plating as aggregate form. Methods of electroless plating commonly used for plastics may be advantageously employed, with no need for the degreasing and etching steps. The plated particles thus obtained are lighter in weight than conventional products incorporating metal powder, and can be used for applications in which the same degree of electroconductivity as conventional products is required. As may be apparent from the foregoing, fine spherical particles of cured epoxy resin having an average size not larger than 50 Um can be easily produced by the process of this invention. The spherical particles thus produced can be used as such, or after being subjected to heat treatment, acid treatment, dyeing and plating, for the following applications as ingredient of coatings and cosmetics, toners particularly color toners for electrostatic copiers, spacer for liquidcrystal, component of adhesives and pressure sensitive conductive rubber, and medical reagents.Example 1 Ten grams of commercial bisphenol A diglycdyl ether type epoxy resin Epikote 828 Yuka Shell EpoxyKabushiki Kaisha epoxy equivalent approximately 190 was placed in a 100 ml polyethylene cup, commercial polyoxyethylene phenol ether type surface active agent Noigen EA 137 Dai ichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co., Ltd.
