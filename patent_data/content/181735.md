## Description
Crosslinkable Elastomeric Materials The present invention relates to crosslinkable thermoplastic elastomeric materials and to a process for producing such materials. Thermoplastic elastomeric materials are well known in the prior art as elastomeric materials which are capable of being thermoformed into useful articles. It is also known that articles made from such materials can be crosslinked to form articles having improved properties e.g. improved high temperature dimensional stability by the action of vulcanising agents such as sulphur or organic peroxides. Curable i.e. crosslinkable compositions of this type are described for example in GB A 2028837. In the field of conventional thermoplastic polymers i.e. nooelastomeric polymers it is known that certain of these polymers, for example, polyolefins polyvinyl chloride and ethylenelunsaturated ester copolymers can be rendered crosslinkable by incorporating hydrolysable silane groups into the molecular structure of the polymer e.g. by copolymerisation, grafting or transesterification techniques . Crosslinking of the produced silane modified material is achieved by exposing the final thermoformed article to a hydrolysing agent, e.g. water, preferably in the presence of a silanol condensation catalyst.Crosslinkable materials of this type are described, for example, in GB A 2028831, GB A 2039513, GB A 1415194, GB A 1357549, GEA 123S034 and GB k 1286460. It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for opanufacturing crosslinkable silane modified thermoplastic elastomeric material having improved properties. Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the production of a crosslinkable thermoplastic elastomeric material comprising blending together under conditions which promote graft copolymerisation components comprising A a nitrile rubber component and B a thermoplastic organic polymer component characterised in that 1 the thermoplastic organic polymer component B has pendant silane groups bearing hydroylsable functions or 2 simultaneously with, or subsequent to, the blending graft copolymerisation, an unsaturated silane compound bearing hydrolysable functions is grafted into the blend or 3 in the case that thermoplastic organic component B can be a copolymer containing polymerised units of meth acrylic acid or alkyl meth acrylate, simultaneously with or subsequent to the blendingigraft copolymerisation a silane compound having the general formula X CH2 a Si Y 3 is reacted therewith to introduce pendant silane substitutents into the thermoplastic organic component B, or 4 in the case that the thermoplastic organic component B can be a copolymer containing polymerised units of vinyl alcohol or vinyl carboxylate, simultaneously with or subsequent to the blending graft copolymerisation a silane compound having the general formula Z CH2 a Si Y 3 is reacted therewith to introduce pendant silane substituents into the thermoplastic organic component B , wherein X is OH, SH, NH2, or R COO R is 1 18C alkyl or CH2 C R1 R1 is H or 1 18C alkyl a 1 18 and each Y is independently H, 1 18C hydrocarbyl, 1 18C alkoxy or 1 18C alkoxyalkoxy provided that at least one of the Y groups is the alkoxy or alkoxyalkoxy group, and wherein Z is R200C , R2 being H or 1 18C alkyl. The present invention further provides a crosslinkable elastomeric thermoplastic material comprising a graft copolymer of A a nitrile rubber end 3 a thermoplartic organic polymer characterised in that the units of A and or B in the graft copolymer have pendant silane groups bearing hydrolysable functions. Nitrile rubbers are well known in the art and are copolymers of a diene and an unsaturated nitrile for example, isoprene acrylonitrile copolymer and butatlene acrylonltrile copolymer. In the present invention a preferred nitrile rubber is butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer. Preferably the nitrile rubber, e.g. butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer, has an acrylonitrile content of from 20 to 45X by weight. The thermoplastic organic polymer component employed in the process of the present invention can be a thermoplastic organic polymer modified by the presence of pendant silane groups or can be an unmodified thermoplastic organic polymer. Examples of unmodified thermoplastic organic polymers suitable for use in the process of the present invention are thermoplastic polymers or copolymers of one or more of olefins, vinyl chloride, vinyl ethers or unsaturated esters. Examples of suitable unmodified thermoplastic organic polymers are polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene hydrocarbon copolymers e.g. LLDPE , ethylene alkyl acrylate or methacrylate copolymers, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers, hydrolysed or partially hydrolysed ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers and ethylene vinyl ether copolymers, or blends of two or more of these organic polymers.Copolymers of ethylene with an alkyl meth acrylate are preferred.Particularly preferred are copolymers of ethylene with an alkyl acrylate or methacrylate wherein the alkyl group contains from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Preferably such ethylene alkyl meth acrylate copolymers contain from 75 to 95Z by weight based on copolymer of ethylene. Thermoplastic organic polymers modified by the presence of pendant silane groups bearing hydrolysable functions are well known in the art and they can be prepared, for example, by copolymerisation, silane grafting or transesterification techniques carried out prior to the blending and grafting of A with B . For example, a thermoplastic organic polymer component having pendant silane groups can be prepared by copolymerising an unsaturated monomer, for example ethylene, with an unsaturated silane compound having hydrolysable functions in the presence of a free radical initiator or a Ziegler catalyst. Such copolymerisation techniques are described for example in GB A 2028831, GB A 2039513 andGB A 1415194.Methods for making thermoplastic organic polymer components by the silane grafting technique are disclosed, for example, in GB A 1357549, GB A 1234034 and GB A 1286460. The silane graft polymerisation method forms the basis of the well known SIOPLAS RTM commercial method for making crosslinkable thermoplastic polymers. A method for making thermoplastic organic polymer components by transesterification is described in EP A 4752. The ratio of nitrile rubber component to the thermoplastic organic polymer component employed in the process of the present invention or present as units thereof in the thermoplastic elastomeric material is preferably from is preferably 1 20 to 10 1, most preferably 1 4 to 4 1 parts by weight based on the total weight of nitrile rubber A and thermoplastic organic polymer B . The blending of the nitrile rubber component with the thermoplastic organic polymer component is suitably carried out in the presence of a free radical initiator to promote grafting using, for example an azbcompound or an organic peroxide capable of generating free radicals under the graft copolymerisation conditions. Examples of suitable free radical initiators are azo bisisobutyronitrile, dicumyl peroxide, 1,l di tertiarybutylperoxy 3,3,5 trimethyl cyclohexane, ditertiarybutyl peroxide, 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 bis tertiary butyl peroxy hexane, tertiarybutyl cumyl peroxide, bis tertiarybutyl peroxy isopropyl benzene, tertiary butyl peroxybenzoate and 4,4 ditertiarybutyl peroxy n butyl valerate. The free radical initiator can be supported on an inert carrier if desired, for example, precipitated calcium carbonate or silica. The quantity of initiator employed is suitably 0.05 to 4.0 wit , preferably 0.1 to 3.Owt based on the weight of A plus B. The graft copolymerisation of the nitrile rubber component A and the thermoplastic copolymer component B is suitably carried out at a temperature above the melting temperature of A and B.Generally temperatures in the range 110 to 210 OC are found satisfactory. The unsaturated eilane compound employed either in the preparation of the silane modified thermoplastic organic polymer or in the alternative embodiment 2 in the process of the present invention is preferably a compound having the general formula RlSiR2my3 m wherein R1 represents an ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbyloxy group R2 represents an aliphatic saturated hydrocarbyl group Y represents the hydrolysable organic group for example Y can be halogen or alkoxyl and m represents zero, 1 or 2. Examples of preferred unsaturated silane compounds are vinyl trimethoxy silane, vinyl tris methoxyethoxy silane, vinyltriethoxy silane and vinyltriacetoxy silane. One or more such silanes can be employed if desired. The quantity of unsaturated silane compound employed in the preparation of the silane modified thermoplastic organic polymer or in the alternative embodiment 2 of the present invention is suitably sufficient to provide a concentration of 0.05 to 10 weight X, preferably 0.5 to 5 weight Z of calculated as weight of silane monomer employed per 100 parts by weight of A plus B. In embodiment 2 of the process of the present invention the unsaturated silane compound having hydrolysable groups can be grafted subsequent to the blending graft copolymerisation of the nitrile rubber with the thermoplastic organic polymer or can be grafted in situ simultaneously during the blending graft copolymerisation process. In the case that the grafting of the unsaturated silane is carried out in situ , the free radical initiator s employed in the graft copolymerisation are generally found suitable for the silane grafting also. When the silane grafting is carried out as a subsequent step, the same chemically or different initiators can be employed. It is preferred to carry out the graft copolymerisation of A and B, and the grafting of the unsaturated silane compound simultaneously i.e. in situ . The graft copolymerisation of the nitrile rubber A with the thermoplastic organic polymer and the simultaneous or subsequent grafting of the unsaturated silane compound can be carried out using conventional melt blending or extrusion apparatus if desired. For example the components can be mixed in a rubber mill or mixer or a screw extruder until the desired grafting has been achieved. For example, the grafting conditions e.g. quantity of peroxides, temperature and time are preferably such that the final crosslinkable thermoplastic elastomeric material has a high load melt index BS 1SO 1133 1981 E Condition 7 in the range 0.5 to 50 grammes per 10 minutes 21.6kg load 1900C .
