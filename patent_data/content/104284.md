## Description
COMBINED DENTAL DRILL AND ANCHOR PIN The present invention relates to a novel dental appliance.More particularly the invention pertains to a conbined dental drill and anchor pin for use in teeth restoration and orthodontic procedures. In conventional dentistry procedures it is customary to install one or more pins into broken down teeth or into teeth to which orthodontic appliances are being applied.The treatment of broken down teeth is of course more prevalent, and the present invention will be discussed primarily in conjunction with restorative techniques for treating teeth where the nerve is still alive. It will be understood, however, that the invention is also applicable to orthodontic techniques or to non vital teeth. As is well known, the conventional procedure is to initially drill one or more relatively deep holes in the dentin portion of the tooth undergoing repair. The drilling can be carried out, for example, by utilizing a typical dental twist drill. The dentist then screws in a small, screw threaded anchor into each of the holes, leaving a portion of the screw threaded pin sticking out of the hole.The remainder of the screw threaded pin is retained in the dentin as the anchor. Illustrative U.S. patents pertaining to anchor retention pins include the following Baker 3,364,575 Tieche 4,142,293 Chan 4,187,611 Smith 4,189,834 Weissman 4,202,101 Carse 4,219,620A commercially available screw pin is sold by PulpdentCorporation of America as Stabilok screw pins underU.S. Patent No. 4,189,834. A number of commercially available dental drills have been employed for making the holes or channels in the dentin which are required for the anchor pins. In accordance with present day practices, therefore, two instruments are needed a drill, e.g. a twist drill and a diameter coordinated screw pin. After the twist drill digs its deep hole or channel, the path of insertion must again be found in order to screw in the screw threaded anchor pin. Since the drilled hole is very tiny, in general being of the order of 0.53 itrn, t plus or minus a few 100 orl0nm units, in diameter. If the screw threaded pin is not inserted with its long axis exactly parallel and in line with the orifice and the long axis of the hole, it is difficult, if not impossible, to successfully screw the pin into the hole. Moreover, sometimes the drilled hole or opening is in a difficult location for good accessibility or visibility.At times, the drilled hole or channel is obfuscated by debris or saliva. According to the invention, a drill and an anchor pin are combined in one structure. In general, the overall instrument or device of this invention has at its end a short drill, e.g. a twist drill, immediately followed by an anchor pin section, a major portion of which will generally protrude above the surface of the dentin and which will serve as the retaining or reinforcing device for enhancing the attachment of an amalgam filling or other restorative material to the tooth. In order to limit the drilling depth, a stop means is positioned on the shank carrying the drill bit and the anchor pin. Furthermore, the device is provided with a weakened point, i.e. a frangible reduced portion or shearing joint positioned on the shank immediately following the desired protruding length of anchor pin. The invention will be more fully understood by reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a partly cut away side view showing a combined drill and anchor pin device according to the present invention. Fig. 2 is a partly cut away side view showing several variations on the combined drill and anchor pin device according to the present invention. Fig. 3 is an end view of the single fluted drill illustrated in Fig. 2. Referring now to the drawings and more specifically to Fig. 1, the present invention comprises a combined drill and anchor pin structure 10, which may be a latch type or straight hand piece bur shank made of stainless steel, plated cast iron or any material harder than dentin and suitable for making a drill therefrom has a trailing shank portion 15, an anchor pin 20, a screw threaded portion 21, a groove 19 for debris removal and a drill 30.A stop 35, which may be a part of anchor pin 20, is positioned so that it separates the drill 30 and a portion of the screwthreaded pin from the protruding portion of the anchor pin 20. After drill 30 has pierced the dentin section 50 of the tooth to the desired depth, the stop 35 will come to rest on the top surface 51 of dentin 50 and further drilling will cease. The drill 30 used in the instrument of this invention may be any kind of deep drilling end such as a single flute, or twist drill, suitable for drilling deep pin holes.For many purposes the drill 30 can be a conventional twist drill type. Fig. 1 shows a twist drill while a single flute drill is illustrated in Fig. 2. Portion 21 of the anchor pin secures the anchor pin to the tooth and portion 21 must have a screw thread for the present purposes. The protruding section or portion of anchor pin 20 can be screw threaded as shown in Fig. 1 or can be a straight shank that has been scored or provided with grooves 42 to enhance its functioning as a retention or reinforcing pin. In general, the anchor pin section of the present instrument is screw threaded, and it will have an overall length of from about 3 to 6 mm. For most restorative dental work, the segment of the anchor pin extending above or protruding from dentin surface 51 will range from about 1.5 to 4 rnm. The outside diameter or lands or anchor screw portion 21 must be slightly larger than the diameter of drill 30, while the grooves of the anchor screw pin 21 must be slightly smaller than the diameter of drill 30.Useful diameters of the anchor pin and the drill will range from about 0.43 to 0.71 urn. It will be understood, however, that for some purposes the diameter of that portion of the anchor pin protruding from the dentinal surface may be less or greater than the diameter of the drill 30. As also shown in Fig. 1, the trailing shank 15 has a reduced diameter or shearing joint 40 positioned on the upper end of the anchor pin 20 so as to provide a fracture or shear point. When rotation continues following abutment of the stop 35 against the upper dentin surface 51, shearing joint 40 severs under continuing torsional forces leaving the drill 30 and anchor pin portion 21 securely affixed in dentin 50, and that portion of the anchor pin 20 below shearing joint 40 protruding from dentin surface 51. In Fig. 3,the centerpoint 25 and the cutting edge 26 of the drill are shown. The drill may have single or multiple blades, as desired. Although the use of an instrument having a shearing joint 40 is preferred under the invention it will be understood that other arrangements are also possible.Thus, the trailing shank may be cooperatively attached to an elongated circular cylindrical shank not shown which in turn is attached to a latching type dental hand piece not shown . In such a structure, the trailing shank, which can also function as a part of the protruding anchor pin, is detached from the dental handpiece not shown when stop 35 is in abutment with the upper dentinal surface 51. It will also be understood that the free end of the trailing shank may have a variety of shapes to cooperate with some locking means on a dental handpiece so that the essential structure of the present invention is locked to a powered dental handpiece. As will be comprehended by those skilled in the art, the combined drill and pin instrument of this invention may be used in a variety of orientations at various inclinations and inverted from the position shown in the drawings, so that certain positional terms in the foregoing description are used to describe the relative portions of the combined structure without limitation to their orientation with respect to a horizontal plane.
