## Description
This invention relates to novel quinone derivatives which possess therapeutic and prophylacetic actions against bronchial asthma, immediate type allergy, various types of inflammations, arteriosclerosis, endotoxin shock associated with bacterial infection, etc., to a process for producing the same and to pharmaceutical compositions containing the same, and can be utilized in the field of medicine. Heretofore, it has been regarded as difficult to perform effectively the treatment or prevention of bronchial asthma. In recent years, SRS A slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis which has long been known as one of the important chemical mediators for immediate type hypersensitivity and asthma was shown to be composed of the 5 lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid, namely leukotrienes, which have been attracting attention. The leukotrienes are a potent chemical mediator for the allergic or inflammatory reaction, and is considered to cause mainly constriction of peripheral airways in the lung, being related with respiration distress accompanied by bronchial asthma. Also, the leukotrienes possess the capabilities to enhance the capillary permeability and to strongly produce chemotactic activity of leukocytes, and are intimately associated with edema and cellular infiltration, which are typical symptons of inflammation. They furthermore, with their potent vasoconstriction action, are considered to contribute eventually to the incidence of coronary insufficiency and angina pectoris. Accordingly as the pathophysiologic significance of the lukotrienes has becone clarified as is described above, the importance of the 5 lipogenase, a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of the leukotrienes, has come to be recognized.
