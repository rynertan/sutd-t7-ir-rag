# Polyarylate polyester grafted elastomer blends.

## Abstract
The invention deals with impact modified polyarylate polyester blends. Molding compositions having improved notched izod impact values after molding, comprise a blend of a polyarylate, a polyester, and an impact modifier which is a graft copolymer of a vinyl aromatic, an acrylate, an unsaturated nitrile, or mixture thereof, grafted onto an unsaturated elastomeric backbone and having a tensile modulus of less than about 7 x 10‚Å∏Pa. Also, decabromodiphenyl oxide may be included in said composition.
