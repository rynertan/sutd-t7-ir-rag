# A method for producing improved high yield pulps.

## Abstract
Improved chemimechanical, particularly chemither momechanical pulp, CTMP is produced by defibrating or refining chips, screening and dividing the screened pulp into fractions of mutually different fiber composition. The defi brated or refined pulp is divided in a first screening means by taking out at least 30 by weight of the incoming fiber suspension as a first long fiber fraction and a first fine fiber fraction, this latter being divided in a second screening means into a second long fiber fraction which is combined with the first long fiber fraction to form a long fiber fraction of improved properties, which is removed from the process, and a second fine fiber fraction of improved properties, which is also removed from the process.
