# Control system for sewing machine.

## Abstract
A semiautomatic sewing system 10 comprises a sew ing machine 12 , a drive unit 42 including a variable speed motor and encoder for counting stitches sewn, material edge sensors 40 mounted in spaced relationship in front of the needle 22 of the sewing machine, and a microprocessor controller 51 coupled to the sewing machine controls. Accurate control of seam lengths and end points is achieved by initiating countdown of a variable preprogrammed num ber of final stitches responsive to material edges detected by the sensors 40 only when the stitch count falls within a predetermined window of values so that inaccuracies from stitch counting are limited to a small portion of the overall seam length. If the sensors 40 do not detect a material edge within the window of stitch values, the sewing system 10 reverts to pure stitch counting to determine seam length.
