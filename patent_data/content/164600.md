# Medical needle device and medical equipment having the same.

## Abstract
A heat sterilized medical needle device having a needle cannula 3 with a pointed distal end 2 , a hub 5 supporting a proximal end portion of the needle cannula 3 at one end thereof and allowing connection of a tube at the other end thereof to allow communication between the tube and the needle cannula 3 therethrough, and a protector 7 com prising a hollow body with a closed distal end and an open proximal end and sealing a portion of the needle cannula 3 which is exposed from the hub within the hollow portion thereof. The hub 15 has a thin portion 9 to be twisted and broken to disconnect the hub 5 from the protector 7 , and the hub 5 is coupled to the protector 7 to form a liquid tight joint by blocking at a portion of the hub 5 which is closer to the pointed end 2 of the needle cannula 3 than the thin portion 9 .
