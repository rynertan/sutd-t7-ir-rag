# Improvements in or relating to transimpedance amplifiers.

## Abstract
A transimpedance amplifier allows an optical transmitter and receiver to be in close proximity to each other without fear of overloading the receiver. The improvement increases the dynamic range of the transimpedance amplifier and thereby the operating range of the receiver. A peak detector 22 at the output of an inverting amplifier 11 within the transimpedance amplifier turns on a field effect transistor FET circuit 23 when an AC component of an electrical signal becomes so large than the inverting amplifier would otherwise go into saturation whereby the FET circuit 23 acts as an AC shunt impedance at the input of the inverting amplifier and diverts the excess AC current to ground 30 . Also, the FET circuit 23 acts as a DC resistance in concert with sense and sink current mirrors 21 and 24 to effectively divert an excessive DC component of the electrical signal away from the input of the inverting amplifier 11 . Although the dynamic range of the transimpedance amplifier is increased, the optical sensitivity and the performance of the receiver remain unchanged.
