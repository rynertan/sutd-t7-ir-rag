# Electro magnetic alignment assemblies.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to electromagnetic alignment apparatus, which is particularly adapted, among other pos sible uses, for use in aligning the wafers in a microlitho graphy system, said apparatus comprising in combination a first magnetic circuit 12 having a plurality of elements including a first magnet 10 a second magnetic circuit 16 having a plurality of elements including a second magnet 14 the second magnetic 16 circuit being disposed in spaced relationship with respect to the first magnetic circuit 12 a movable structural component 18 adapted for mounting an object 20 thereon one element of each mag netic circuit being fixedly attached to the movable structural component first and second current carrying coil assem bies 34, 36 mounted in the first magnetic circuit 12 the second coil 36 assembly being disposed at an angle with respect to the first coil assembly 34 third and fourth cur rent carrying coil assemblies 38, 40 mounted in the second magnetic circuit 16 the fourth coil 40 assembly being disposed at an angle with respect to the third coil assembly 38 and control apparatus 82 for controlling the flow and direction of the current through the coil assemblies, respec tively.
