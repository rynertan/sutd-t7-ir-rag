## Description
The present invention relates to coating compositions capable of forming hardened films by bridge polymerization which are extremely superior in terms of coat working property, storage stability, and are superior in terms of abrasion resistance, water resistance, thermal resistance, solvent resistance, durability and adherence property to a base material, and synthetic resin moldings of abrasion resisting property using it. if synthetic moldings made of acrylic resin, polycarbonate resin, sterol resin, AS resin, polyvinyl chloride resin, acetate resin, ABS resin, polyester resin, etc. are insuffcient in the abrasion resistance of the surface, the surfaces are damaged due to actions such as contact and collision with other objects, scratches, etc. during the transportating and assembling operations of the moldings, thus resulting in deteriorated product appearance or spoiled beauty. For example, lenses, covers, cases mirrors etc. are considerably damaged on the surfaces, decreasing the commodity values. In particular, resin moldings for kitchen use in electrically driven splitting and crushing equipment with cutting edges provided therein are placed under severe circumstances during use and are subjected to hard impacts and abrasion due to the crushing. In addition, the resin moldings for kitchen use are rubbed with nylon brushes even during the washing operation after the use. They are subjected to friction and thermal impacts such as exposure to hot water. As a result, many flaws are produced in the container, thus causing stains, which not only spoil the beauty, but also allow food to be left in the flaws giving rise to a bad smell and insanitation. For example, a resin molding, made of AS resin, for a coffee mill and spice crusher is flawed in many locations at one time when cinnamon has been crushed and is stained. Also, when cloves have been crushed, the resin molding is encroached and stained. Thus, the problem is solved through replacement of the resin molding by a glass container. However, the glass container is heavier and is inconvenient to use. The size precision of the glass container during the formation is worse, the price is higher and impact resistance is worse. The methods of improving the disadvantages of such resin molding have been variously examined. For example the methods, of coating the surfaces of the resin molding with a silicone series coating material, a melamine series coating material to improve the disadvantages through the heating and hardening operations, are already known. However, since these materials are higher in hardening temperature and are longer in hardening time, the resin molding which is vulnerable to the heat is likely to be deformed and be varied in size. For better adherence property, primer treatment is required, thus resulting in higher treatment cost. Namely, the primer treatment can be performed on acrylic resin, but cannot be performed on the AS resin, etc., which is lower in thermal deformation temperature. Thus, the resin is required to be selected for the use. Chemical Abstracts, Volume 90, No. 4, 1979, page 84, abstract 24897 g discloses a coating composition comprising a monomer having 4 acryloyloxy groups pentaerythritol tetraacrylate being capable of forming hardened film by the application of activated energy rays. This monomer is used together with a bisphenol A type compound having bridge members OX₁ OX₂ OX₃ . This coating composition is good in flexibility and poor in terms of heat resistance, surface hardness and adherence to plastics. Also, this prior art aims at good flexibility, not at good hardness etc. FR A 2 339 657 discloses a coating composition containing as one ingredient a compound of the general formula of claim 1 of the present invention, but necessarily uses a component defined by formula which is not used according to the present invention. This citation necessarily needs a reactive solvent, as set out in claim 1, page 31, line 15. The epoxy acrylate of this citation can be hardened only to a hardness lower than 3H in pencil hardness, if subjected to hardening by rays. Accordingly, an essential object of the present invention is to provide coating compositions and resin molding using the same which can eliminate the disadvantages inherent to the prior art, and which is extremely superior in terms of coat working property, storage stability, abrasion resistance, water resistance, thermal resistance, solvent resistance, durability and adherence property. This and other objects of the present invention will clearly be understood by the explanation as mentioned hereinafter in conjunction with embodiments. The object of the present invention is met by a coating composition as defined in the independent claims. When the proportion of the multifunctional monomer in the mixture is 70 or less by weight, not only insufficient surface hardness, but also inferior abrasion resisting property is provided. Also, when the proportion of the multifunctional monomer exceeds 98 by weight, unfavourable phenomena such as cracked film, inferior adherence property or the like are caused although no problems occur in abrasion resisting property. In the multifunctional monomer of 3 or more functions, one type may be used singly or multifunctional monomers of two types or more may be mixed. Also, a bi functional oligomer which has many single element bonds is required to increase the solvent resistance of the bridge hardened film and to give flexibility. The proportion of the bi functional oligomer in the mixture is required to be within the range of 2 through 20 by weight. When the proportion in the composition of the bi functional oligomer exceeds 20 by weight, the viscosity of the composition increases to decrease the coating property so that the uneven coating is likely to be caused and the abrasion resisting property also reduces. Also, when the proportion of the bi functional oligomer is less than 2 by weight, the flexibility is removed in the film, thus causing cracks in the film. Also, to increase the flexibility, n is required to increase in number. When the n more than 5 , the surface hardness becomes lower and the coating property becomes worse. Also, when the n is less than, the flexibility becomes inferior. In addition, the mixture A can be mixed in the range of the two functional meth acrylate monomer 5 through 60 by weight in terms of viscosity adjustment, adherence property with respect to the base material, etc. hereinafter this mixture is represented as mixture B . When 60 or more by weight is included, the surface hardness becomes inferior and the solvent resistance, etc. becomes inferior. Also, in 5 or less by weight, the viscosity cannot be adjusted and the bridge density becomes smaller, thus resisting in inferior solvent resistance. Also, it is preferable to mix the monofunctional meth acrylate monomer, within the range of 2 through 50 by weight, respectively, with the mixture A and the mixture B hereinafter they are represented as mixture C and mixture D , whereby the adherence property with respect to the base material can be improved. However, in 50 or more by weight, not only the surface hardness and abrasion resisting property, but also the solvent resistance becomes inferior. Also, in less than 2 by weight, the adherence property with respect to the base material cannot be improved. Acrylate series abrasion resisting film materials have been proposed in Japanese Patent Laid Open Publications No. 102936 1978, No. 104638 1978, No. 126473 1977, No. 85265 1977, No. 76343 1977, No. 83477 1975, etc. in addition to the present invention. However, no proposals have been made from the prior publications, which cause the inventors to infer that the bisphenol A meth acrylate two functional oligomer of the formula of claim 1 is suitable to increase the surface hardness without any reduction in adherence property and to increase the solvent resistance. Also, FR A 2 339 657 discloses a coating composition capable of forming hardened films, which, however, necessarily needs a reactive solvent and which is not sufficient in hardness for many practical applications. In the particularly preferable embodiments of the multifunctional monomers for use in the present invention, there are enumerated dipentaerythritol hexa meth acrylate, dipentaerythritol penta meth acrylate, dipentaerythritol tetra meth acrylate, pentaglycerol tri meth acrylate, trimethyldpropane tri meth acrylate, pentaerythritol tri meth acrylate, pentaerythritol tetra meth acrylate, etc. as monomers of 3 functions or more. In addition, there are enumerated ethylene glycol meth acrylate, 1,3 propyleneglycol di meth acrylate, 1,4 butanediol di meth acrylate, 1,5 hexanediol di meth acrylate, diethyleneglycol di meth acrylate, neopentaglycidyldiacrylate, etc. as monomers of two functions or more. Also, as monofunctional monomers, there are enumerated 2 hydroxyethyl meth acrylate glycidyl meth acrylate, tetrahydro meth acrylate, etc. The present inventors have found out that after 5 to 70 by weight of an organic solvent has been mixed to adjust the viscosity of the coating composition thereby to fully examine the coating operational property a mixed solvent containing at least one alcohol in the range of 60 or more by weight to be selected from alcohols of 2 through 4 in number of carbons, from alcohols such as ethyl alcohol, normal propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, normal butyl alcohol, normal pentyl alcohol, etc., aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, etc., and ketones such as acetone methyl ethyl ketone, etc., and ethers such as dioxy acid, etc. and esters such as ethyl acetate, acetic acid n propyl, acetic acid n butyl, propionic acid ethyl, etc., is preferably used for a coating material for resin moldings. For example, in the case of residual distortion remaining in the resin molding, cracks occur in the portion when methyl alcohol or ethyl alcohol is used alone. Also, a mixed solvent having the solvent of the esters or ketones of 40 or more by weight contained therein not only attacks the base material of the resin molding, but also delays the scattering speed, and remains in the film as remaining solvent to cause a problem in terms of thermal resistance. However, to improve the adherence property with respect to the base material, the aromatic hydrocarbons, the ketones, the ethers, the esters may be blended with 40 or less by weight with respect to the total amount of the organic solvent. To apply coating composition on the surface of the resin molding to form bridge hardened film, there is a method of applying activation energy rays such as ultraviolet rays, electronic rays, radiant rays or the like according to the present invention. Among them, the method of applying the ultraviolet rays is the most preferable bridge hardening method in terms of the practical use. To bridge harden the coating composition with ultraviolet rays, it is required to have light sensitizer therein. Specifically, there can be enumerated the carbonyl compound of benzoin, benzoin ethyl ether, benzoin isopropyl ether, benzoin isobutyl ether, acetone, butyroin, toluoin, benzyl, benzophenone, p chlorobenzophenone, p methoxybenzophenone, etc. sulfur compound such as tetramethylthiuramdisulfide azo compound such as azobisisobutyronitrile, azobis 2,4 dimethylvaleronitrile, etc. peroxide compound such as benzoyl peroxide, dz tert butyl peroxide, etc. and so on. These light sensitizers may be singly used or the combination of two types or more may be used. To promote the acceleration effect, there are amines such as methyl diethanol amine, triethanol amine, N methylmorpholine, triethylamine, dibutylamine, N,N dimethylbenzylamine, N,M dimethylaniline, etc. The addition amount of these light sensitizers is preferable to be 0.01 through 10 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight in the total of mixtures A , B , C , D and the organic solvent. In the 10 parts or more by weight, bad influences wherein weather resistance of coloring the film decreases will be produced. Also, in the 0.01 parts or less by weight, the hardening is difficult to be performed. Inorganic materials such as charge preventing agent, interfacial activator, pigment, aerosil etc. can be properly added, when required, to the coating composition for use in the present invention. Also, the coating composition used in the present invention can be applied for the convenience of the operation by spray application, dipping application, rotation application, brush coating or the like. To improve the storage stability, the polymerization inhibitor of 10 through 2,000 ppm is required to be added. The polymerization inhibitor of 2,000 ppm or more delays the bridge hardening speed and the polymerization inhibitor of 10 ppm or less deteriorates the storage stability. p benzoquinone, hydroquinone, p methoxyphenol or the like can be used as the polymerization inhibitor. The coating composition used in the present invention is preferable to be 10 cps mPa s or more in viscosity at 25 C and is desired not to be influenced by the hardness of the base material when the bridge hardened film has been rubbed by the hard object. As a result, the bridge hardened film is required to be 5 µ or more, preferably 10 µ or more. The contents of the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to embodiments.
