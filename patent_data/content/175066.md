# Correction method of color separated signals.

## Abstract
Color separated signals, which are adapted to fabri cate color separated printing plates, are subjected to ICR processing by the hand re touching technique while watch ing them on a color monitor which is employed to simulate printing results , thereby avoiding occurrence of localized irregularity in color tone. The method of this invention fa cilitates the ICR processing in a hand re touching manner and at the same time, permits immediate observation of correction results while watching the progress of the processing on the color monitor.
