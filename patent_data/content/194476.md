# COEXTRUSION INSPECTION SYSTEM

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for ultrasonically inspecting coextruded plastic sheet as it is produced. The apparatus comprises means for supporting a sec tion of sheet in position to be inspected, and means for supporting transducer means in contact with the surface of said sheet. The transducer means comprises at least one housing supporting an ultrasonic transducer and defining a chamber between the face of the transducer and the surface of the sheet. The chamber is filled with an interfacing fluid so that ultrasonic pulses from the transducer will pass through the fluid into the sheet to be reflected from any interface therein. The transducer means and interfacing fluid are moved across the surface of the sheet to permit inspection of the entire sheet. Thus, it is unnecessary to submerge the sheet in a vat of interfacing liquid or to bend or otherwise deform, and possibly damage, the sheet as is done in current systems. The apparatus further includes means within said chamber for directing interfacing fluid substantially trans versely across the face of the transducer for washing away any air bubbles that may form in the interfacing fluid between the transducer and the surface, together with means for maintaining a substantially continuous flow of the fluid thereacross. The ultrasonic pulse echoes received from the sheet are analyzed to provide an indication of the presence and thickness of layers therein.
