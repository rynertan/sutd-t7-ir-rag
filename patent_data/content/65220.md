# Outserted shape and outserting shaping method.

## Abstract
The outserted shape includes a metal plate 8 formed with a plurality of through holes, a plurality of resin portions 15 connected to resin filled in the through holes and bulging on opposite sides of the metal plate 8 , the resin portions 15 having a planar cross section larger than that of the through holes, and a plurality of resin components 14 each formed inte gral with one of the resin portions 15 . The resin com ponents 14 are secured in place on the metal plate 8 separate from and independent of each other by virtue of residual thermal stress produced by the difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion between the resin portions and the metal plate, in such a manner that the radially oriented residual thermal stress in each resin portion is symmetrical with respect to the center axis of one of the resin components 14 .
