SOLUBLE COPPER SALT CONTAINING COMPOSITIONS USEFUL FOR FORMING TECNETIUM LAPLLED RADIODIAGNOSTIC AGENTS Afield of the Tnvention The present invention relates to compositions for making technetium labelled radiodiagnostic agents and, in particular, to soluble copper salt containing compositions for reducing technetium or accelerating the reduction of technetium for labelling such radiodiagnostic agents, kits for preparing such 99mTc labelled radiodiagnostic agents with technetium, and methods for labelling such radiodiagnostic agents with technetium. background of the Invention Various complexes of monodentate and bidentate ligands with technetium have been made and studied. These complexes have been made in many cases for use in studies to determine the various oxidation states of technetium and for other research regarding the structure of such complexes and metal coordination chemistry. Such studies have been reported in, for instance, Chemistry and Industry, pp. 347 8 March 26, 1960 J. Tnorq, NucL.Chem., Vol. 28, pp 2293 96 1966 Aust. J. Chem., 23, pp 453 61 1970 Inorganic Chem., Vol. 16, No. 5, pp. 1041 48 1977 J. Tnorg.Nuci. Chem., Vol. 39, pp. 1090 92 1977 and JCS. flaiton, pp. 125 30 1976 . In recent years many compounds or ligands have been labelled with technetium for use as radiodiagnostic agents. For instance, in a presentation to the AmericanPharmaceutical Association, E.A. Deutsch disclosed that certain complexes of DIARS, i.e.EMI2.1 and Tc 99m, and certain complexes of DMPE, i.e. CH3 2 PCE2CE2P CH3 2, and Tc 99m may be useful as radiodiagnostic agents for myocardial or hepatobiliary imaging. t99mTC DMPE 2C12 and t99mTc DIARS 2 Br2 1 were prepared byDeutsch by heating in an open flask a reaction mixture containing the appropriate hydrogen halide in aqueous alcohol solution, 99mTc sodium pertechnetate, and ortho phenylenebis dimethylarsine , i.e DIARS, or bis 1,2 dimethylphosphino ethane, i.e. DMPE. The reaction was reported to take about 30 minutes. The labelled complex was then purified by chromatographic methods involving ion exchange columns. U.S. Patent No. 4,452,774 describes coordination complexes of an isonitrile ligand with various radionuclides including technetium. Representative isonitrile complexes include those represented by the formula LA CN xR yBzB tin in which A is a radionuclide selected from radioactive isotopes of Tc, Ru, Co, Pt, Fe, Os, Ir, W, Re, Cr, Mo, Mn, Ni, Rh, Pd, Nb, and Ta, for example, 99mTc, 99Tc, 97Ru, 51cr, 57Co, 188Re and l91os CN xR is a monodentate or polydentate isonitrile ligand bonded to the radionuclide through the carbon atom of the CN group R is an organic radical B and B are independently selected from other ligands well known to those skilled in the art that result in isonitrile complexes, including solvents such as water, chloro and bromo groups, and ligands comprising one or more neutral donor atoms capable of forming bonds with said radionuclide x and y are each independently, integers from 1 to 8 z and z are each independently 0 or an integer from 1 to 7 with the proviso that xy z z is less than or equal to 8 and n indicates the charge of the complex and can be O neutral , or a positive or negative integer the value of which depends upon the vaience state of A, and the charges on R, B and B . Any desired counter ion can be present as required by the charge on the complex with the proviso that such counterion must be pharmaceutically acceptable if the complex is to be used in vivo. Particularly useful isonitrile ligands are the homoleptic six coordinate hexakis cationic complexes having the formula rA CNR 6J in which A is a monovalent radionuclide such as technetium, CNR is a monodentate isonitrile ligand, and R is an organic radical. A suitable counterion is also present. A bisamide bisthiol N2S2 chelate that forms a complex with reduced technetium, E99mTcO ema 1, was described as a potential renal agent by Davison et al . Nucl, Med. 20 60 , 641 lay79 . it was subsequently shown to be excreted into both the urine and bile in a chemically unchanged form, Jones et al 3. Null. Med. 23 9 , 801 1982 , thus fulfilling one of the requirements for a renal radiodiagnostic agent. Such ligands are typically labelled with technetium by combining the ligand in solution with pertechnetate and a reducing agent. Generally, tin or stannous ion is used as the reducing agent for the technetium. However, other reducing agents have been utilized for this purpose. U.S. 4r314,986 describes a method of reducing the pertechnetate in Tic04 comprises mixing together an aqueous solution of pertechnetate, e.g. the eluent from a technetium generator, metallic tin or an alloy thereof as a reducing agent for the pertechnetate, and a soluble salt of a metal below tin in the electrochemical series, e.g. copper, as an activator for the tin reducing agent. A complexing agent for the reduced technetium or a colloid stabilizer may also be included. The pH is preferably 3 to 12. European Patent Application Publication No. 0 063 946 describes a complex of technetium 99m with an acid having the formula HOOC CH2 X CH2 COOH, where X is sulphur or selenium, having glomerular filtration and tubular secretSbd tbbt ieE which make it useful in the diagnostic technique of renography to give a dynamic representation of the functioning of the kidneys.The complex may be prepared a by reducing Tic04 with a Sn reducing agent in the presence of Cu and of the acid, or b by reducing Tic04 with a tin metal reducing agent in the presence of a cupric salt and of the acid. In both U.S. 3,314,986 and European Publication No. 0 063 946, the tin or stannous salt is the reducing agent and the cuprous or cupric ion is used as a catalyst for the tin or stannous salt. Some target seeking ligands are not labelled as easily or efficiently with technetium using conventional labelling techniques. For instance, to obtain high yields of technetium labelled DMPE, temperatures of about 1300C are required. Thus, new techniques for labelling ligands with technetium that facilitate or accelerate the labelling process are desirable.Summary of the rnvention The present invention provides a method and compositions for preparing technetium complexes for use as radiodiagnostic agents.

The term slower alkyl when used in this application designates aliphatic saturated branched or straight chain hydrocarbon monovalent substituents containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n propyl, n butyl, t butyl, etc. The term substituted lower alkyl when used herein includes alkyl groups substituted with halide, hydroxy, carboxylic acid, or carboxamide groups, etc. such as, for example, CB2OH, CH2CH2COOB, CH2CONH2, OCH2CH2OH, OCH2COOH, OCH2CH2CONH2, etc. Some examples of thiol protective groups are lower alkylaminocarbonyl such as ethylaminocarbonyl, lower al kanoylaminomethyl, a roylaminomethyl, t butyl, acetamidomethyl, arylmethyl such as triphenylmethyl trityl and diphenylmethyl, aroyl such as benzoyl, aryloxycarbonyl such as phenoxycarbonyl, arylloweralkoxylcarbonyl, preferably arylmethoxycarbonyl such as benzyloxycarbonyl, and lower alkoxycarbonyl such as t butoxycarbonyl.

Examples of such bisamido, bisthio compounds include N 2 mercaptoethyl 2 mercaptoacetylOglycinamide N 12 benzOylthio ethyl 2 benzoylthSoacetyl glycinamide N 12 tacetamidomethylthio ethyll 2 acetamidomethylthioacetyl glycinamide 2 mercaptoacetyl glycyl cysteine methyl ester 2 benzoylthioacetyl glycyl S benzoyl cysteine methyl ester E2 acetamidomethylthio acetyljglycyl S acetamidomethyl cysteine methyl ester 2 mercaptoacetyl glycyl cysteinet 2 benzoylthioacetyl glycyl S benzoyl cysteine 12 acetamidomethylthio acetyllglycyl tS acetamidomethyl cysteine 2 mercaptoacetyl glycyl cysteinyl glycine methyl ester 2 benzoylthioacetyl glycyl S benzoyl cysteinyl glycine methyl estert t2 tacetznidomethylthio acetyllglycyl S acetamidomethyl cysteinyl glycine methyl estert N t2 mercaptoethyl N l carbomethoxy 2 mercaptoethyl oxamide N t2 benzoylthio ethyll N carbomethyoxy 2 benzoylthio ethylloxamidesN 2 acetamidomethylthioNethyll N tl carbomethoxy 2 tacet amidomethylthio ethyli oxamide N,N bis 2 mercaptoethyl oxamide N,N bis 2 benzoylthio ethylioxamide N,N bisl2 acetamidomethylthio ethylloxamide l R,R N,N bis l carbomethoxy 2 mercaptoethyl oxamide tR,R N,N biE l carbomethoxy 2 benzoylthio ethylloxamide and R, N,N bistl carbomethoxy 2 acetamidomethylthio ethyll oxamide. The organic radicals i.e. R groups referred to in the structual formulas herein can be aliphatic or aromatic and may be substituted with a variety of groups which may or may not I be charged. Among the aromatic R groups which may be present are phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, naphthyl, diphenyl and substituted aromatic groups containing such substitutents as halo, e.g., chloro, bromo, iodo or fluorot hydroxy, nitro, alkyl, alkoxy, etc. among the aliphatic R groups which may be present are alkyl, preferably containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n pro l isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, n hexyl, 2 ethylhexyl, dodecyl, stearyl, etc.Substituent groups may also be present in the aliphatic groups, including among others the same substituent groups as those listed above for aromatic groups. In general, it is desirable to achieve the characteristics of the labelled complex without the need for substituent groups. Thus, it is preferred for the sake of simplicity to employ unsubstituted hydrocarbon groups as the R groups whenever possible. However, the lipophilic characteristics of the complex can be further varied by varying the R groups to adapt the complex for labelling selected materials, for membrane transport such as for the blood brain barrier, or for imaging selected organs and dynamic processes related to their function. Any donor element can be used in the target seeking ligand in accord with this invention provided that it is a neutral donor atom having a free electron pair available for accepting a proton to provide a charged ligand and further provided that it has the capability of complexing with technetium Tc 99 or Tc 99m . Suitable such elements include, for instance, phosphorous P , arsenic As , nitrogen N , oxygen 0 , sulfur S , antimony Sb , selenium Se , tellurium Te , and the like. Although technetium complexes prepared in accord with 1 invention can be neutral, or positively or negatively t ged, the class of lipophilic cationic complexes is presently w 3ferred. Preferably, the complexes prepared in accord with this invention are kinetically inert, and hence stable products.however, the complexes need only be sufficiently stable for the intended use. Any desired counter ion may also be present in the çomposition, such as , in the case of cationic complexes, chloride, fluoride, bromide, iodide, hydroxide, sulfate or bisulfate, dihydrogen phosphate, fluoroborate, hexafluorophosphate, etc. The copper can be supplied by any soluble copper salt having a pharmaceutically acceptable anion, but preferably is in the form of a cupric salt. The sulfate and chloride salts are preferred. The compositions of this invention are useful for preparing radiodiagnostic agents wherein the target seeking ligand is labelled with technetium. Labelling is accomplished by mixing a suitable quantity of 99mTc pertechnetate in solution with the cupric ion and target seeking ligand, and heating the admixture for a suitable length of time at a temperature attainable with a constant temperature water bath. Preferably, the heating step is performed at 100 C for thirty minutes or less. An aqueous physiological saline solution is typically the solution of choice for labelling the target seeking ligand because it is readily administered to the patiY, During labelling the pH of the solution is desirably less than 3. Preferably, the pH is less than 2.2. It has been found that the addition of stannous ion to the composition can increase the yield of technetium complex up to about 10 . In addition, the presence of ascorbic acid in the composition significantly increases the yield of the technetium complex at higher pH levels. The compositions of this invention are preferably contained in a kit, such as a presterilized vial. The presterilized vial, such as a glass vial, containing the compositions of this invention is ready for use for preparing cationic technetium complexes for radiodiagnostic use. More preferably, the compositions are lyophilized in such kits to increase storage stability of the compositions. In such lyophilized kits, the target seeking ligand is generally present as a water soluble acid salt of the ligand. The lyophilized kits are used by reconsituting with a suitable quantity of 99mTc pertechnetate in saline solution. T reconstituted compositions are then placed in a constant temperature water bath for a sufficient time to form labelled technetium complexes with the target seeking ligand. Preferably, the reaction time is about 30 minutes or less at a temperature of about lOO0C. In order to obtain high quality images the yield of radioactive labelled cationic technetium complex should m ably be greater than 70 after recorstltnting the y lized mixture and labelling. Lower yields will result in poser image quality and undesirable purification steps will be z uired to produce high quality images. This invention will be further illustrated by the examples that follow tDatation of I.l Bfs dimethvlDhosDhina ethane bis hisulfate. 2 . nEPEw22 2Rs0 4 or DMPR 292fiQ4 Dissolve 470 mg of DMPE in 10 ml of ethanol in a 50 ml round bottomed flask maintained under a nitrogen atmosphere.

To the flask was added the required amount of each solid, then an appropriate volume of degassed saline was added to dissolve the solids and bring the total volume to near the final volume, with stirring nitrogen gas bubbled through the solution at steady rate during the preparation of bulk formulations. The pH was then adjusted with either 3N B2S04 or 2N NaOB to the desired pH. Volume of the bulk solution was finally adjusted gravimetrically by addition of saline. Several 0.8 ml aliquots of the bulk solution were dispensed into 10 cc vials, crimp sealed and flushed with nitrogen. NOTE This volume was chosen for the kit so that addition of 0.2 ml of Tcggenerator eluate would result in a 1.0 ml final volume of solution. The bulk solution was made more concentrated to compensate for this dilution.i After reconstitution with 0.2 ml 99mTc04 eluate, each kit or vial was heated in a boiling water bath 1000C for 15 minutes unless indicated otherwise. .
