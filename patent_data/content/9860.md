## Abstract
A device containing a length of elongate material, especially a desoldering wick of braided wire having a coating of rosin thereon, comprises a unitary annular body molded of plastic material including a central hub 30 , first and second annular sides, with respective continuous rims, the hub, sides and rims defining an annular chamber receiving the coil therein, the rims defining a continuous annular slot therebetween communicating with the outer periphery of the annular chamber to permit the free end portion of the length of elongate material to extend therethrough in controllably engaged fashion. Each annular side has a plurality of annularly spaced portions 34 defining a plurality of axially extending openings 36 communicating with the annular chamber so as to provide for the free exterior communication of the exposed surfaces of the coil, with the annularly spaced portions of each side axially accessible through the openings of the other side. Thus a one piece molding is provided enabling ventilation to the coil for drying the rosin after the desoldering wick is wound on the coil.
