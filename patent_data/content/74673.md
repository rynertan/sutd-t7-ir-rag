# Apparatus and method for inverting and applying flanged lids to erected cartons.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for handling and applying formed flanged lids F to cartons K , wherein inverted lids drop on an upper conveyor belt 12 directly from a forming machine for travel in a first direction A , then drop and flip through an inverting station I to the desired upright position on a lower conveyor belt 20 for movement in a second direction A‚ÇÅ toward a lidding station L . To prevent over flipping, the trailing edge is guided by a vertical guide plate 26 . An idler belt 41 is positioned downstream of the second conveyor belt 20 and above the feed path, a lug 43 on the idler belt engaging the leading edge of the lid F being transferred from the second conveyor belt 20 , to hold the lid in proper alignment for driving forwardly by abutting engagement of the carton intersecting the leading edge of the lid. The idler belt 41 is carried by a pair of idler rollers 45, 46 with an adjustable brake 47 on one of the rollers controlling the drag on the belt to restrain the lid and assure positive lidding action on the carton. As the carton moves beneath the idler belt, the lid is progressively sealed onto the carton, a second or trailing lug 42 on the idler belt serving to press down the trailing edge, the next in line lug 44 being timed to be positioned at the lidding station to intercept the next lid for application to the next in line carton F . Rollers 50, 51 of larger diameter than the trailing roller 46 of the idler belt firmly press the lateral edges of the lid down on to the carton.
