## Description
DESCRIDTION ELECTROSTIMULATION OF MICROBIAL REACTIONS Microbe reactions, i.e., fermentation, are the biological conversion of a feedstock, ie., a substrate, to a metabolite, i.e., a product, by the actions of microbes. Microbe reactions are characterized by the growth of the microbe, and the subsequent formation of a metabolite product. That is, substrate is used initially for the growth and maintenance of the microbes, and subsequently for both the growth and maintenance of the microbes and for the formation of product. Product formation is related to the concentration of substrate, the concentration of microbes, and the yield coefficients of product and microbes with respect to the substrate.Moreover, the concentration of microbes is a function of the specific growth rate of the microbes, and the yield coefficient of the microbes with respect to the substrate. Fermentation reactions are typically slow reactions.That is, they require long residence time, i.e, high ratios of reaction medium volume per unit volume of production per unit time. They also. have a long initia tion time. That is, metabolite product cannot be formed in large quantities until high concentrations of microbe are present. Nutrient, i.e., substrate, is initially utilized primarily to grow and maintain microbes, and there after it is utilized to a greater extent to form metabolite product. Moreover, the reactions, involving microbial growth and division, ar e ccoplex. For example, when the microbes are bacteria, cell growth and division is by fission, I.e., an individual cell will double in mass and content of cell constituents, and then split into two identical daughter cells. Ry way of contrast, yeasts are a class of mic.loorganism that grow and divide by budding. That is, a bud will grow on an individual cell until it matches the size of the original cell, and then separate, leaving a bud scar. Fungi grow by chain enlongation and branching, i.e., with growth proceeding from the tip of the mycelium through the formation of septa between individual cells.Cell division may require anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour for bacterial growth, from 45 minutes to 2 hours for yeast growth, and from one to eight hours for fungi or mycelial growth. The specific path of product synthesis, i.e., the reaction path for the formation of the metabolite product from the substrate or nutrient is not clearly understood for every fermentation reaction. Rowever, it is believed to depend upon microbe growth and concentration, nutrient utilization, and metabolic controls. It has now been found that the reaction rate of fermentation reactions, that is, the yield per unit time, unit volume, unit nutrient or substrate concentration, and unit microbe concentration is enhanced by the application of an alternating or pulsed high frequency electric field to the reaction medium of microbes, substrate, and nutrients. As used herein, the terms nfermentation , fermentation reactions , and reactions utilizing fermentation techniques include aerobic and anaerobic metabolic activity of a microbe or microbes in which chemical changes are brought about in an organic or inorganic substrate, and any process mediated by or involving microbes or microorganisms in which a product accrues . As used herein, the terms microbes , microbe , micrcorganisms , and tmicro organism include prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Prokavyotes , as used herein, means unicellular microorganisms, including bacteria and unicellular blue green algae. Eukaryotes , as used herein, means multi cellular microorganisms, including fungi, yeasts and actinomycetes. As used herein, the terms microbes , microbe , microorganisms and microorganism include immobilized microbes and systems and structures of immobilized microbes as well as nonimmobilized microbes.As used herein, the terms microbes , microbe , microorganisms , and microorganism include both naturally occurring strains and artificial recombinant strains. Fermentation reactions, i.e., fungus, yeast, actinomycetes, and bacterial fermentation reactions are utilized industrially. Fermentation reactions are capable of wider industrial use based upon raw material availability and costs, by product usage, and increased reaction rats. According to the invention described herein, any or all of the reaction rate, the innoculum build up, or efficiency of conversion are increased by electrical stimulation. Electrical stimulation may be utilized to reduce the time required to carry out the reaction or to increase the productivity of a given unit of production, that is to increase the number of batches that can be fermented in a given reaction vessel. By electrical stimulation is meant the application of a pulsed or alternating high frequency electric signal field across the broth whereby to pass an electrical current through the broth, e.g., by inserting electrodes in the broth, under conditions which increase the rate of the microbial reaction, while substantially avoiding significant destruction of the micro organisms, e.g., fungi, bacteria, yeasts or actinomycetes, the reactants, e.g., the substrate, or the products. It has been found that a frequency of from about 1 kilohertz to about 1000 kilohertz is particularly satisfactory in carrying out the method of this invention. The elt ctric al stimulation electrical carrent may be an alternating current or pulsed direct current0 It should have a frequency of from about 1 kilohertz to about 1000 kilohertz, although frequencies below about 1O megahertz may be used as well as frequencies above about 0.1 kilohertz with some increases in yield. Howr rer care should be taken erg. by using a frequency above about 0.1 kilohertz, to avoid large amounts of electrolysis occurring within the reaction medium at low frequencies. The method of this invention may advantageously be carried out at various ranges of the electrolytic variables, i.e., electrode area, inter electrode spacing, inter electrode volume, current, current density, current per unit inter electrode volume, current per unit broth volume, voltage, voltage per unit interelectrode spacing, power per imit inter eiectrode volume, power per unit broth volume, and frequency. For example, the method of this invention has been carried out utilizing Saccharomyces cervisiae to ferment glucose at currents per unit interelectrote volume of from about 1 x 10 3 milliamperes per cubic centimeter to about 30 x 10 3 milliamperes per cubic centimeter of inter electrode volume, at currents per unit broth volume of from about 1 x 10 4 milliamperes per cubic centimeter to about 50 x 10 4 milliamperes per cubic centimeter of broth, current densities of about 2 x 10 2 milliamperes per square centimeter to 5 xl milliamperes per square centimeter of electrode area, voltage fluxes of 0.1 to 3 millivolts per centimeter of interelectrode space, interelectrode power dissipations of 0.2 x 10 7 7 watts per cubic centimeter to 6 x 10 7 watts per cubic centimeter of interelectrode volume and broth power dissipations of 0.2 x 10 8 watts per cubic centimeter of broth volume t o 8 x 10 8 watts per cubic centimeter of broth volume. Electrolytic variables, i.e.currents, voltages, and power dissipations, and products and quotients thereof, outside the above ranges may be utilized as long as care is taken, by avoiding simultaneous astomer of the ranges, to avoid destruction of the microbes. According to one exemplification of the method herein contemplated, a reaction medium of a hexose, e.g., glucose, other nutrients, and a yeast, oaccharomZces cerevisiae is provided. A pair of electrodes are spaced about 4 te about 7 centimeters from each other within the broth, and an electrical current at a current density of about 0,1 to about 0.3 milliamperes per square centimeter of electrode area is passed through the reaction medium at a frequency of about 100 kilohertz to about 1000 kilohertz. In this way, the yield of product per unit of substrate per unit time is increased by about 15 to about 20 percent compound with the result without electrical stimulation. According to an alternative exemplification of the method of this invention, a reaction broth of a bacterium such as Bacillus polymyta or Bacillus licheniformis, and glucose are prepared. The fermentation reaction is then carried out whIle an alternating current having a frequency of about 1 kilohertz to about 1000 kilohertz, an imposed voltage signal sufficient to provide a current of 1 x 10 3 milliamperes per cubic centimeters of interelectrode volume and 10 1 to 5 milliampers per liter of solution is imposed across the broth. The resulting production rate of butane diol is increased by about 20 percent compared with the result without electrical stimulation. The method of electrostimulated fermentation herein described is useful with single cell blue green algae, bacteria, yeasts, and actinomycetes.

The following examples are illustrative EXAMPLE I Electrostimulated and conventional fermentations were carried out in a batch react or. The reaction broth was prepared by placing 1500 milliliters of distilled water in a sterilized 3 liter beaker. Carbohydrates, water and nutrients were added to the beaker in the following quantities Glucose 220 grams NaCl 3 grams NH4 2SO4 6 gramms 2.4 2.4 grams KH2P04 0.4 grams Distilled Water to make 2 liters Thereafter, a 200 milliliter portion of the glucose solution was laced in a sterilized container and 14 grams of Fleischmann s Baker s Yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisae, was added thereto and stirred to form a slurry.The yeast glucose slurry was divided into two equal portions of 100 milliliters each and put into two 1 liter sterilized resin kettles. To each of the divided yeastglucose slurries were added 2.1 grams of corn meal, and 700 milliliters of the glucose solution. The outlets of both reactors were connected to wet test meters to measure the gas produced. One reactor was run without electrical stimulation.

Thereafter, 7.0 grams of Bleischmann s dried Baker sYeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, was poured on top of the reaction broth. The reactor was then closed, with gas venting through a water seal bubbler. The mixture was allowed to stand for 18 hours. Thereafter, at 24 hour intervals, the slurry was removed from the reactor by aspiration and filtered to recover the yeast cake. The yeast cake was added to 1.0 liter of fresh reaction broth and returned to the kettle, which was sealed with a gas vent to a burette of 1 percent sulfuric acid and stirred for 5 minutes.

Four gas volume readings were taken at half hour intervals beginning one hour after electrical stimulation, and used to calculate a test gas evolution rate, RT For the fermentation with electrostimulation, RT is the gas evolution rate. For the fermentation without electrostimulation, RT is the gas evolution rate measured simultaneously with and calculated in the same way as the gas evolution rate for electrostimulation. After three hours of electrical stimulation, the current was turned off for 19 hours, and then reaction slurry removed as described above. Each electrode was a nickel wire, 0.63 millimeters diameter, spiraled twice around a four inch 10 cm long, 3 millimeter diameter glass rod. The electrodes were spaced 6.5 to 7.0 centimeters apart.

EXAMPLE IV A series of tests were conducted to compare electrostimulated fermentation with conventional fermentation. For each test a simple nutrient solution was prepared. A portion of the nutrient solution was withdrawn to make a yeast solution. The remainder of the nutrient solution was divided into two equal portions and placed into two identical laboratory fermenters. Both fermenters had an electrode pair.Fleischmann e Baker s Yeast, Saccharomyces cervisiae, was slurried in the remainder of the single nutrient solution. The nutrient solution, containing the yeast, was divided in half. Each half was placed into one of the two identical laboratory fermenters. A voltage signal was applied across one solution only of the pair.Solution samplea were simultaneously taken from both solutions of the pair. Differences between the two ferment at ions of a pair were attribllted to electrostimulation, while differences between sets of pairs of fermentations were attributed to conditions of the nutrient and innoculum solutions prior to commencing the tests. For each fermentation a resin kettle fermenter was used. The resin kettle fermenter had an inside diameter of 10 centimeters, a depth of 15 centimeters, and was sealed on top. Each resin kettle fermenter had a sample probe, a pH probe, a mechanical stirrer, a sodium hydroxide inlet, a gas outlet, and an electrode pair. The electrodes were a pair of two inch 5 cm by two inch 5 cm stainless steel plate electrodes spaced two inches 5 cm apart. A gluccse solution was prepared by adding in order Glucose r 0 220 grams NE4C1 10 grams Na2HPO4.7H2O 22 grams KH2PO4 12 gram MgSO4 1 gram CaCL2 0.04 gram H20 to make 2 liters The glucose solution was boiled, and the pH was adjusted to pH 5 with H3P04. A yeast slurry was prepared by withdrawing 200 milliliters of the glucose solution, and stirring 3.6 grams of Fleischmann s Bakers Yeast Saccharomyces cervisiae into the nutrient. Each test was commenced by dividing the nutrient solution into two 800 milliliter portions and placing one portion of the nutrient solution into each resin kettle fermenter. Thereafter the slurry of yeast and nutrient was divided into two 100 milliliter portions.One portion of the yeast nutrient slurry was added to each of the resin kettles. The resin kettles were maintained at a temperature of 30 degrees Centigrade by immersion in a water bath.The pH was maintained between pH 4.7 and pH 5.2 by addition of aqueous NaOH. In each run a 300 kilohertz, 1.5 milliampere, 50 millivolt signal was applied across tbe electrode pair in one kettle. No signal was applied to tbe electrode pair in the other kettle.
