# Adaptive radar signal processor for the detection of the useful echo and the cancellation of clutter.

## Abstract
Adaptive radar signal processor apt to detect the useful echo in the presence of an additive disturbance made up of clutter and noise, through which the disturbance can be cancelled and the useful signal can be enhanced by means of the synthesis of a filter, adapted to the useful signal, which rejects the disturbance spectrum frequency components by adapting itself in real time to its variations.
