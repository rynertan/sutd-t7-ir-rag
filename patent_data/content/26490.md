## Description
BACKGROUliD OF THE INVENTION The use of a ethylene containing aqueous latexes is of significant importance. Generally these latexes are produced at elevated pressures thus necessitating the use of special pressure resistant equipment. Of particular interest are the vinyl chloride ethylene and viny acetate ethylene latexes in many instances in combination with other comonorners. Over the decades the technology has developed extensively from the early efforts exemplified, for example, in U.S. 2,497,291 to the more refined procedures employed in the production of such latexes in use today. Notwithstanding all of the improvements that have been achieved there is still need for further improvement that would enable one to carry out the process at lower pressures and in such manner that there was improved control of the free monomers content in the reactor as well as the monomers content of the polymer itself. SCMMARY OF THE l AnNNTION It has now been found that aqueous latexes can be produced wherein the polymer molecules have essentially the same composition as the composition of the monomers feed introduced to the reactor at preselected reactor pressure at a given temperature.This is accomplished by a method that comprises the steps of charging to the reactor an initial reactor charge, purging the reactor and sealing it, optionally adding an initial portion of the monomers mixture to the reactor, heating the contents of the reactor and then adding initiator and the balance of the monomers mixture at such rates that a preselected reactor pressure is maintained, and simultaneously maintaining a monomers starved condition in the aqueous phase of the polymerization reaction mixture. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention an aqueous emulsion polymerization process has been found for producing polymers containing from about 1 to about 30 weight percent of ethylene in which the major monomers charged, including the ethylene, are mixed and fed to the reactor such that the concentration of cach monomer in the aqueous phase of the reaction is below its saturation point, in other words, a monomers starved condition is maintained in the aqueous phase Under these conditions, the preselected reactor operating pressure that is chosen is maintained within narrow limits by control .of the monomers feed to the reactor this feed control in turn holds a low and essentially constant amount of free monomer in the reactor and maintains a monomers starved condition in the aqueous phase.As a result, the monomer feed automatically follows the rate of polymerization and the polymer produced has essentially the same monomers content as the feed. The result is excetonal process control, which translates to a reproducible product. Further, the low free monomer content in the reactor contributes to safety of operation and, the ability to set the pressure of operation substantially below the pressure heretofore used for the production of a similar polymer permits substantial investment economies in equipment and operation. The present process differs significantly from heretofore used processes, which have been operated under conditions that involved a mwnomer rich system, that is, a system in which the aqueous phase was saturated with one or more of the monomers.Under monomer rich conditions the addition of an incremental amount of monomers mixture with the same mole ratio as that of the undissolved monomers present in the reactor yields no significant increase in the system pressure because the vapor pressure in the reactor is at its maximum as dictated by the mole fractions of the various monomer components in the mixture at the given temperature. The process of this instant invention, requires a monomers starved system in which the aqueous phase is not saturated with the monomers.Thus as an incremental amount of the monomers mixture is added, it dissolves and equilibrates between the polymer phase suspended in the emulsion, the aqueous phase of the emulsion, and the vapor phase. Since the monomers mixture contains ethylene, the incremental addition of the mixture to the monomers starved system causes an increase in the reactor pressure as the monomers concentration in the aqueous phase moves toward the saturation level. Conversely, the lack of monomers feed during the polymerization causes a loss of monomers in the latex particle and subsequently a loss of monomer from the aqueous phase which in turn re equilibrates with the vapor phase to cause a drop in reactor pressure. Thus, by adjusting the feed of monomers mixture one controls the reactor pressure and maintains the monomers starved system. Several unexpected advantages were observed by the use of this instant process. Since the preselected reactar ,ressure controls the feed of the mixed monomers to the reactor, the rate of monomers feed effectively follows the rate of polymerization. when the pressure rises above the preselected reactor pressure at constant temperature the monomers feed is slowed or stopped until the pressure returns to the preselected value.If the pressure in the reactor falls below the preselected value, additional feed of monomers beyond the rate of use of the monomers by the polymerization reaction is sustained so as to return the pressure tothe desired level. Since the pressure is quite sensitive to the ethylene dissolved in the aqueous phase, a tight control of monomer feed to match the rate of polymerietion is easily attained. Further, unlike the known monomer rich emulsion polymerization, the pressure in our process can be arbitrarily set at any value below the point of saturation of the aqueous system.If a monomer rich system at 450C yields a pressure of 1000 psig to yield a polymer of a given composition, the sane composition of matter may be obtained by the process of this invention at that temperature by operating the starved system at either 900 psig, 800 psig or 700 psig. The polymer composition obtained by the instant starved process will be essentially the same regardless of the pressure because the monomers feed follows the rate of polymerization with a minimum of free monomers thus what is fed must be essentially the composition of that polymerized. E a polymerization to yield a specified polymer composition is monomerrich at 1000 psi and 450C but is operated starved at a lower pressure to yield the same composition, one would find that the monomers conconerations in both the aqueous phase and dissolved in the latex particle became lower as the operating pressure is detseased. This reduced monomer concentration can lead to a reduced rate of polymeri7aiton and a lower molecular weight, but the composition of matter will still be essentially the same, as exemplified in Examples 3 and 4. Further it was also found that given a fixed operating temperature and a required composition of matter, the ability to choose a reactor operating pressure using the instant monomers starved process significantly below that rqired by a similar monomer rich emulsion polymerizatron means that significant savings in capital investment may be attained.In brief, therefore, the instant monomers starved feed process in comparison to the generally used monomer rich processes yields improved safety because of a very low monomer concentration throughout the run, excellent process and compositional control, and the expectation of reduced investment. The initial reactor charge is either water or a mixture of water with one z more of the additives conventionally present in an emulsion polymerization reaction. Such additives are well known to those skilled in the art and include the protective colloids, surface active agents, buffers, reductants or oxidants, activators, or any of the other known additives, in the quantities conventionally employed. The initial reactor charge may also optionally contain one or more polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers at a concentration up to about 75 weight percent of the total weight of the initial reactor charge. Among the suitable protective colloids one can mention the synthetic polymers such as polyvinyl alcohols, partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate degree of hydrolysis approximately 88 to 98 , polymethacrylic acid and its salts, polyvinyl pyrrolidones, salts and derivatives of olefin maleic acid anhydride copolymers such as, for example, reaction products of alkali liquors, ammonia, smines or ethanolamine with copolymers of maleic acid anhydride and ethylene, isobutylene or styrene, polyacrylamides cellulose derivatives which dissolve in water to form 0.05 to 1.5 by weight solutions at temperatures of from 40 to 800c, such as methyl celluloses, methylethyl celluloses, carboxymethyl celluloses, hydroxyethyl celluloses, methylhydroxyethyl celluloses, hydroxypropylniethyl celluloses natural substances such as vegetable rubber for example gum arabic , alginates and the like. The protective colloids are used in quantities of from 0.05 to 1.5Z by weight and preferably in quantities of from 0.2 to 0.8 by weight, based on the quantity of polymer. The surface active agents which can be used are nonionic, anionic or a combination of both nonionic and anionic surface active agents. Suitable non ionic surface active agents include polyoxyethylene condensates some specific polyoiyethlene condensates which can be used include polyoxyethylene aliphatic ethers, polyoxyethylene hydroabietyl ether and the like polyoxethylene alkaryl ethers such as polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether, polyowyethylene octylphenyl ether and the like polyoxyethylene esters of higher fatty acids such as polyoxyethylene laurate, polyoxyethylene oleate and the like as well as condensates of ethylene oxide with resin acids and the tall oil acids polyoxyethylene amide and amine condensates such as N polyoxyethylene lauramide, andN lauryl N polyoxyethylene amine and the like and polyoxyethylene thioethers such as polyoxyethyleneN dodecyl thioethe r. A condensate of ethylene oxide with a hydrophobic base formed by condensing propylene oxide with propylene glycol is also suitable. Examples of suitable anionic surface active agents include the alkali or ammonium alkyl benzene sulfonates R C6H4 S03 salts having about 10 to 18 carbon atoms in the linear or branched alkyl radical, or mixtures thereof alkali or ammonium alkylsulfonates having 8 to 20, preferably 10 to 18, carbon atoms in the linear or branched alkyl radical, or mixtures thereof alkali or ammoniu n salts of sulfosuccinic acid esters ROOCCH2CH S03H COOR having 4 to 18 carbon atoms preferably 6 to 12 carbon atoms in the alcohol component, or mixtures thereof fatty alcohol sulfates of the formula R 0 SO3Me, where R represents a linear or branched alkyl radical with 10 to 18 atoms.Me is an alkali ion or ammonium ion NR4 where R alkyl with 1 to 6 carbon atoms or CH2CH2oH . However, it is also possible to use fatty alcohol eulfates or fatty alcohol sulfate mixtures with predominantly or exclusively secondary alkyl sulfates sulfates of substituted polyglycol ethers and alkali salts of fatty acids The surface active agents are used in quantities of from 0.1 to 57. by weight and preferably in quantities of from 0.2 to 3 by weight, based on the quantity of water added per unit of time. The function of the buffer substances used in the process of this invention is to maintain a pH value of from 3.5 to 8.5, a pH value of from 3.5 to 6.0 being preferred for the polymerization of monomer mixtures rich in vinyl acetate, while a pH value of from 3.5 to 8.5 is preferred for monomer mixtures rich in vinyl chloride. The quantity in which the buffer substances are used is governed by the type and quantity of peroxides, reducing substances and hydrophilic cm monomers used. In most cases, alkaline reaction additives should be used on account of the H30 ions formed,for example, during the decomposition of a persulfate. Additives of this kind include alkali hydroxides, alkali salts of carbonic acid, ammonium, borax only where hydroxyethyl cellulose is used , alkali phosphates and alkali acetates. A catalytic reagent is used in the process of this invention when this catalyst is a redox system the two components of the redox system are maintained in separate feeds or charges until they have been added to the reactor, as is well known.These catalytic reagents are well known and various free radical forming initiators can be used for carrying out the polymerization of the monomeric materials suitable for use in the process of this invention one can mention the water soluble inorganic peroxide compounds, for example persulfates such as ammonium, sodium or potassium persulfate and or hydrogen peroxide. However, it is also possible to use water soluble compounds of the azodinitrile, peroxy acids, peroxy ester, diacyl perioxides, peroxy mono and peroxy dicarboxylic and ester, of the dialkyl and diaryl peroxide and of the alkyl hydroperoxide types, which have adequate solubility in water through suitable substitution with hydrophilic groups. In addition to the aforementioned peroxide compounds, it is possible to use the known reducing substances to accelerate polymerization redox activation , especially at polymerization temperatures below 700C. Substances suitable for this purpose include sulphur compounds with a low oxidation state such as sulfites, hydrogen sulfites, metabisulfites, thiosulfates, formaldehyde sulfoxylates, sulfinic acids, reducing nitrogen cowpounds such as hydroxylamine and hydroxylammonium salts, hydrazine and hydroxylammonium salts1 polyamines and, finally, reducing saccharides such as sorbose, glucose, fructose or endiols, such as ascorbic acid. The quantity in which the initiators are used amounts to from 0.1 to 2.5 by weight and preferably to from 0.5 to 1.5 by weight, based on monomer. In addition, the catalyst system can be further sensitized with activators such as heavy metal compounds, sometimes in the form of metal chelate complexes, iron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum, nickel and cerium representing suitable heavy metals.Preferred complex formers include ethylene diamine, diethylene tetramine, triethylene tetramine or carboxymethyl hydroxyalkyl , carboxymethyl derivatives of ammonia, ethylene diamine, diethylene tetramine, for example nitrilotriacetic acid and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. As previously indicated, the initial reactor charge can additionally contain one or more polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers.These monomers can be the same as those present in the monomers feed subsequently fed to te initial reactor charge or they can be different monomers.Any of the monomers known to those skilled in the art as useful in the production of latexes can be used these are so well known that there is no need to list them here for one of ordinary skill in the art to comprehend which monomers are suitable the literature is replete with patents and other publications in which they are identified. To add latex stability, hydrophilic monomers may also be copolymerized. Typical examples are acids such as acrylic, methacrylic, itaconic, maleic, fumaric, and vinyl sulfonic. The salts of these acids may also be used and the half esters of maleic and fumaric. Compounds specifically designed to be polymerizable surfactants may also be utilized While the process of this invention has been exemplified with vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate as the major monomers, the emulsion polymerization of I to 30 percent of ethylene with other monomers as a significant component is also possible. Such systems as acrylates and methacrylates could be utilized. Regardless of the nature of the major monomer besides ethylene, all manner of other monomers may be added into the polymerization for the special benefits desired.The use of monomers designed to stabilize the latex has been discussed above. Other monomers which lead to other functionality such as hydroxyla, carboxyl and oxiranes for postpolymerization reactions may be added. Examples of these are hydroxyethyl acrylate, acrylic acid, and glycidyl methacrylate. Other specialized monomers for adhesion and molecular weight building may also be added. Examples of the former are shown in US. 4,104,220, and 3,404,114. Examples of molecular weight builders are N methylol acrylamide, N isobutoxymethyl acrylamide, trimethylol propane triacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, 1,6 hexanediol diacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate, allyl methacrylate, divinyl benzene, diallyl maleate, and diallyl phthalate.Further additional properties may be attained with the addition of other common monomers such as alkyl acrylate, alkyl methacrylates, vinyl ester, dialkyl maleates, dialkyl fumarates, acrylamides, vinyl halides, acrylonitrile, and olefins. Small amounts of water soluble solvents such as methanol may also be added, especially if very water insoluble monomers, such as vinyl stearate, are used. In terms of the process it has generally been advantageous to maintain a mean polymerization temperature of about 500C although a temperature of from about 300 to 800C is aceeptaSle. Temperatures of from 700 to 750C are suitable for an initiator based on peroxydisulfate. The reactor pressure required depends on the amount of ethylene desired in the product, the operating temperature, the major comonomer involved, and the degree to which the process is monomers starved. Pressures from 50 to 2000 psig may be utilized although pressures from 100 to 1500 psig are preferred. In carrying out the process of this invention the initial reactor charge is charged to the reactor and then the reactor is purged by usual procedures to remove atmospheric gases and sealed. One such procedure is to purge witch ethylene. After purging one can optionally add an initial portion of the monomers mixture to the reactor prior to heating. This addition is not a prerequisite in the process however, when such initial portion is added it can constitute up to about 30 percent of the total weight amount of monomers mixture to be added to the reactor during the course of the polymerization reaction, preferably this amount, when employed will be from 1 to 15 percent thereof. The monomers feed mixture contains, based on the total weight of the mixture, from about 1 to about 30 weight percent of ethylene, preferably from about 5 to 25 weight percent, from about 40 to about 99 weihtpercent of vinyl chloride or vinyl acetate or vinyl propionate or mixtures thereof, preferably from about 60 to 90 weight percent, and from about b to 20 weight percent of one or more other polymerizable monomer, preferably from about 0 to 5 weight percent, which polymerizable monomer contains the cthylenically unsaturated group. After addition of the initial portion of the monomers feed to the reactor1 if such initial portion is to be added, or when not added after the addition of the initial reactor charge tothe reactor1 the contents of the reactor are heated to from about 300 to about 800C. As a result, the pressure in the sealed reactor increases to 2000 psig at this time the reactor may be either in a monomersrich or monomers starved condition dependent upon the amount of the initial portion of the monomers mixture added to the reactor prior to heating. At this stage either condition is acceptable. The polymerization is then initiated by the addition of oxidant or reductant or both. At this point a feed of the mixed monomers mixture is begun to the reactor at a controlled rate which will soon hold the pressure essentially constant at a preselected and predetermined level. Significant agitation is maintained to disperse and dissolve this monomer in the aqueous phase. Control of the system is most advantageously attained if all or most of the monomers, including the ethylene1 are contained in the same storage feed vessel. This insures that the ratio of ethylene fed to the other monomers fed remains essentially constant. Therefore, since in the starved polymerization system the amount of free monomer is very low, the composition of matter polymerized will very closely approximate the composition of the monomers fed.The monomers mixture fed may be adjusted in composition as the polymerization proceeds, but care must be taken that such shifts in monomer mixture feed composition do not allow the reactor system to slip into a monomer rich condition. Normally a feed of initiator or inititor reductant is continued as the polymerization proceeds. Other minor components such as surfactant and specialty monomers may also be fed without necessarily being in proportion to the main monomer stream, if desired.The monomers mixture feed rate is initially controlled to obtain a preselected pressure value in the reactor1 whether this value be 100 psig or 1,000 psig, and its feed rate is then continued at a rate to control and maintain said preselected reactor pressure and to simultaneously maintain a monomers starved condition in the aqueous phase of the polymerization reaction mixture. The addition of monomers mixture and catalyst components is continued until the desired solids content is achieved, which can be as high as 75 percent or more. Since, at this point, the system still remains monomers starved, little residual monomer exists. The continued addition of free radical generators following the cessation of monomers mixture feed will assist in an even further reduction of residual unreacted monomer.At this point the system may be gradually depressurized in the reactor or blown to another vessel to allow rapid evolution of the unreacted ethylene. Continued efforts at reducing residual unreacted monomer may be taken here either by chemical or mechanical thermal methods. While the process described here most effectively mixes most of the monomers, including the e ylene, in one tank to insure that the feed ratio of ethylene to the other major monomers is essentially constant, this operating technique may be achieved by rationing separate streams to gain the same effect.For instance if one wished to operate in a monomers starved state and have the monomer feed follow the rate of polymerization via pressure control, a loss of pressure in the reactor would call for additional monomer which would then be added from a low pressure tank containing, for example a mixture of vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate or a mixture thereof, the amount fed would then, by the proper automation using readily available equipment, permit the desired amount of ethylene to be injected in a separate stream to retain the desired ratio of ethylene to the vinybmonomers. However, the preferred technique of operation is to mix the ethylene with the major monomers to form a liquid monomers mixture for the monomer feed since operationally the technique is more simple and less prone to error. The technique, however, has the disadvantage of requiring a monomer feed tank which must have the ability to withstand a substantial pressure, normally in the range of 50 to 400 psig at ambient temperature conditions. Such a mix, however, need not be a solution but may be an emulsion, a common procedure in some emulsion polymerizations. The following examples serve to further define the invention.Example 1 A jacketted, glass lined, pressureresistant polymerization reactor, equipped with an agitator, was charged with a solution of 12,258 parts of water, 242 parts of sodium lauryl sulfate, 760 parts of ethoxylated nonylphenol having an average of 9 ethyleneoxy units, 58.5 parts of hydroxyethyl cellulose as protective colloid, 61 parts sodium acetate, 101 parts of sodium bisulfite and 0.2 part of ferrous chloride activator.This initial reactor charge was purged with ethylene and the reactor sealed. A monomers mixturewas prepared containing 65 weight percent vinyl chloride, 16 weight percent vinyl acetate and 19 weight percent ethylene. Also prepared was an oxidant solution containing 293 parts t butyl hydroperoxide, 310 parts of acrylic acid , sufficient sodium hydroxide to raise the pH to 4.5 and 4,600 parts of water. In addition a reductant solution was prepared containing 359 parts of sodium bisulfite, 179 parts of sodium sulfite, 0.5 parts of ferrous chloride and 4,610 parts of water. A 1,839 parts portion of the monomers mixture and 3,647 parts of ethylene were added to the purged initial reactor charge and the contents were stirred and heated to 390C this resulted in a pressure rise to 590 psig. At the time the temperature reached 390C the feed of oxidant solution and reductant solution at a rate of 15 part per minute each was begun. The polymerization reaction started immediately, with its temperature rising to 470C and the pressure to 610 psig. Five minutes after the polymerization began, the monomers mixture feed was begun at a feed rate of 225 parts per minute in 15 minutes the pressure rose to 650 psig at which point the monomers mixture feed was adjusted to maintain a pressure of 650 psig at 450C and a monomers starved condition in the aqueous phase of the polymerization reaction mixture. During the last period of the feed, the pressure fluctuated from 580 to 650 psig.A total of 29,730 parts of monomers mixture was added in this manner over a feed time of 175 minutes 15 minutes later the feeds of oxidant solution and reductant solution were stopped and the reaction mixture was simultaneously cooled and vented to atmospheric pressure over a period of 80 minutes. The total amount of oxidant solution added was 2,600 parts and total reductant solution added was 2,530 parts. The latex produced had a total solids content of 56.4 weight percent. Based on the total solids, the interpolymer contained 63.1 weight percent of vinyl chloride, 16.0 weight percent of vinyl acetate and 16.4 weight percent of eithylene, the latter being calculated from material balance.The polymer had a Tg of 10C. The interpolymer composition compares closely to the composition of the monomers mixture fed to the reactor. Since the polymerization was carried out under starved conditions, there was a low level of free monomer in the reactor during the reaction. Consequently, the composition of the interpolymer produced was essentially the same throughout thereaction because the interpolymer produced was essentially the same as the composition of the monomers mixture fed to the reactor. The product produced in this Example 1 can be compared to that produced in Example I ofUnited States Patent No.3,830,761, which produced an interpolymer containing 61.6 weight percent of vinyl chloride, 15.4 weight percent of vinyl acetate and 17.1 weight percent of ethylene. It is to be noted that the procedure followed in U.S. 3,830,761 was carried out at much higher pressures, from essentially 900 to 1,025 psi. The pressure differential of about 400 psig between Example 1 and the example ofU.S. 3,830,761 is substantially caused because of the difference between starved and monomer rich operation. In the example of U.S. 3,830,it1, the higher pressure is largely caused because the initial monomer charge and subsequent feed exceed the solubility limit of one or more of the monomers in the aqueous phase and hence exerts the full vapor pressure of whatever that composition has become.Example 2 This example illustrates the control achieved over the interpolymer composition by operation under the controlled pressure and starved monomers conditions of the method of this invention.To a jacketted, glass lined, agstator quipped, pressure resistant vessel there was charged an initial reactor charge of 800 parts of water, 0.5 part of sodium dioctyl sulfo succinate, 4 parts of sodium acetate and 0.013 part of ferrous chloride.This initial reactor charge was purged with ethylene and the reactor was sealed. A monomers mixture was prepared containing 1,68Q parts of vinyl chloride, 420 parts of ethylene, 0.8 part of sodium bis tridecyl sulfosuccinate and 12 parts of sodium dioctyl succinate. An oxidant solution was prepareicontaining 12 parts of t butyl hydroperoxide in 300 parts of water. A reductant solution was prepared containing 27.5 parts of sodium bisulfite, 3 parts of sodium acetate, 0.008 part of ferrous chloride and 300 parts of water. A surfactant solution was prepared containing 20 parts of sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate, 40 parts of sodium dihexyl sulfosuccinate, 0.7 part of sodium bis tridecyl sulfosuccinate and 350 parts of water. To the purged reactor there were added 167 parts of monomers mixture, 175 parts of ethylene and 20 parts of reductant solution, and the contents were stirred and heated to 500C. At this point the pressure was 560 psig. The polymerization reaction was initiated by feeding the oxidant solution and reductant solution to the reactor at a rate of 0.92 part per minute for 10 minutes.The feed of monomers mixture at a rate of 10 parts per minute and the feed of surfactant solution at a rate of 1.25 parts per minute were initiated and continued at that rate for about 30 minutes until the reactor pressure reached 660 psig, the preselected pressure desired. At this stage the monomers mixture feed was controlled and adjusted at a rate of from 4 to 9 parts per minute tD maintain a pressure of from 650 to 665 psig and a temperature of from 500 to 540C. These feeds were continued for a total elapsed period of 334 minutes and then terminated.During this period oxidant solution was being fed in at an average rate of 0.92 parts per minute and reductant solution at as average rate of 0.95 parts per minute this was continued for five minutes after termination of the monomers mixture and sufactant solution. The reactor was slowly depressurized and the latex was removed.A total of 1,883 parts of monomers,310 parts of oxidant solution, 325 parts of reductant solution and 265 parts of surfactant solution were added. The latex produced had a total solids content of 55.3 weight percent and the interpolymer had a Tg of 8 C. During the reaction samples were taken from the reactor and the interpolymer analyzed.It was observed that the amount of copolymerized ethylene was initially low because of the lack of sufficient ethylene in the initial reactor charge, but as the addition of monomers mixture continued the system became monomers starved and the monomers mixture fed almost immediately polymerized to produce an interpolymer approaching the same composition as the monomers mixture rid the average composition of the polymer quickly approached the composition of the feed and continued to retain it. These results are tabulated below.The analysis appears to indicate a slightly lower level of vinyl chloride than expected however, this is caused to some extent by the analytical technique used, which is strictly a chloride determnation and does not take into account the additional components in the solids that are neither vinyl chloride or ethylene.After Initiation ofMonomers Mixture Feed Time Elapsed, Monomers Mixture Vinyl Chloride ContentMinutes Fed, Parts of Interpolymer, 30 300 88.5 55 500 85.2 97 750 80.2 157 1,045 81.3 210 1,260 79.6 270 1,518 78.2 303 1,750 78.9 334 1,883 77.1Example 3 The reactor described in Example 2 was charged with an initial reactor charge of 922 parts of water, 69 parts of hydroxyethyl cellulose as protective colloid, 3.5 parts of the ethylene oxide adduct of nonylphenol having an average of 10 ethyleneoxy groups as surfactant, 0.5 part of sodium bicarbonate and 1 part of sodium acetate. A monomers mixture was prepared containing 1,193 parts of vinyl acetate and 132 parts of ethylene. An initiator solution was prepared containing 300 parts of water, 36.4 parts if ammonium persulfate and 2.7 parts of ammonium hydroxide. After purging the reactor charge with ethylene, 140 parts of vinyl acetate were added to the initial reactor charge and the reactor was sealed and the contents heated to 700C. Over a period of 20 minutes 25 parts of the initiator solution were added to begin the polymerization.At this time the feed of monomers mixture was begun at a rate of 23 parts per minute until the pressure reached 125 psig this required about 22 minutes. At the time the pressure reached 125 psig the feed of monomers mixture was decreased and controlled and adjusted to an rate of from 63 to 107 parts per minute to hold the pressure at 125 psig while the temperature was held at from 770C to 820C. The feeds were continued for 175 minutes during which time 1,297 parts of monomers mixture and 220 parts of initiator solution had been fed. After termination of the feeds, the contents of the reactor were held at the same temperature for 45 minutes polymerization of unreacted monomers continued and the pressure dropped to 93 psig. The reaction was cooled to room temperature, vented and the latex recovered. The latex had a 56.9 weight percent total solids.The copolymer had an ethylene content of 10.3 weight percent and a Tg of 100C. The number average molecular weight was 23,300. Example 4 The procedure of Example 3 was repeated with several modifications the ammonium hydroxide was omitted from the initiator solution, and the pressure was held by monomer feed to 80 psig. Due to the lower pressure, a lower monomer toncentration was present in its reactor and, thus, the rate of reaction was much slower. The net result was that although all of the initiator solution was added over a period of 275 minutes, only 650 parts of the monomers solution was consumed. The recovered latex had a 38.9 percent solids content and the polymer had aTg of 110C an indication that it contained about the same amount of ethylene as was incorporated in the polymer of Example 3. The number average molecular weight was 8,480.
