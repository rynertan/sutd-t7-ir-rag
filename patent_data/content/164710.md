# Method for phase locked sampling during measurement of a periodic quantity and device for carrying out the method.

## Abstract
A method for phase locked sampling during measure ment of a periodic quantity u t . n 1 consecutive samples are designated g I ,...., g I n and may comprise one whole or one half period of the periodic quantity u t . The method comprises adapting the sampling frequency and the sample position in relation to the periodic quantity u t to be meas ured such that phase locking is obtained by controlling the time between the samples. Whether the sampling frequency shall be increased, remain unchanged, or be decreased, de pends on a number of decisions depending on the values of g I and g I g I n . The invention also relates to a device for carrying out the method.
