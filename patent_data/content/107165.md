On the basis of the test results, a dosage range of about 0.1 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day to about 50 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day in divided doses at about 4 hour intervals is recommended. For the preferred compounds of the invention tested, it is considered that the compounds are effectively non toxic at the doserates indicated for treatment of inflammatory conditions.Of course, the dosage to be administered depends upon the particular compound use, the age and general health of the patient and the severity of the inflammatory condition. Thus, the dose ultimately decided upon must be left to the judgement of a trained health care practitioner. RPAR Synovitis Technique A Lewis rat is dosed orally with drug or placebo one hour prior to intravenous administration of 2.28 mg of bovine serum albumin BSA in 0.2 cc of pyrogen free saline followed by the intraarticular injection of 0.54 mg of rabbit anti BSA antibody in 0.03 cc of pyrogen free saline into one knee joint. The contralateral knee is injected with 0.03 cc of pyrogen free saline. All injections are made with the animal under light ether anesthesia. Three hous later the rat is again dosed orally with drug or placebo. All drug doses are split. That is, one half of the dose is administered before lesion induction and one half is administered after lesion induction. The following morning about 17 hours after lesion induction the rat is killed and both knee joints are exposed. The subpatellar areolar tissue with attendant synovium is excised and weighed. Differences between the weight of antibody and saline injected knees are considered to represent the inflammatory response for each animal delta synovial weight . Differences in delta synovial weight between lesion controls and drugtreated rats are evaluated for statistical significance with an analysis of variance. Relative potencies are determined with a linear regression analysis.For a dosage of 50 mpk of tested compounds the percentage inhibition of inflammation I listed in the following table Table III has been observed Table III Compound I A 46 B 48A 9 benzyl 1 ,3 dimethyl 8 hydroxy 7 n propyl 9H 6 . oxo pyrimido 2 , 1 f purine 2, 4 dione sodium salt ,B 9 benzyl 1,3 dimethyl 8 hydroxy 7 n butyl 9H 6 oxo pyrimidot2,1 f purine 2,4 dione. Moreover, compound A has been tested and found not to be ulcerogenic at dosages as high as 100mpk oral administration .The compounds of this invention may be processed and dispensed in tablets, capsules or elixirs, for oral administration and solutions or suspensions for parenteral administration. In whatever form the com pounds are dispensed, they may be admixed with the pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, binders, dispersing agents and carriers generally used in the art.Exemplary of the pharmaceutical carriers, excipients, preservatives and binders are gelatin, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talc, vegetable oils, gums, polyalkylene glycols, etc. The pharmaceutical dosage forms are prepared by the methods conventionally used in the art. Further, the dosage units may also contain a compatible anti depressant and or analgesics to treat the depression and pain usually associated with chronic inflammatory conditions.In the following formulation examples the following compounds of the invention are used 9 benzyl 1,3 dimethyl 8 hydroxy 7 n propyl 9H 6 oXo pyrimido 2,1 f purine 2,4 dione, 9 4 fluorobenzyl 6 hydroxy 1,3 dimethyl 7 n propyl 9H 8 oxo pyrimidot2,1 f purine 2,4 dione, 9 benzyl 1 ,3 dimethyl 8 hydroxy 7 n butyl 9H 6 oxo pyrimidot2,1 f purine 2,4 dione, 9 4 fluorobenzyl 1, 3 dimethyl 6 hydroxy 7 n butyl 9H 8 oxopyrimido 2,1 f purine 2, 4 dione, 9 benzyl 1,3 dimethyl 6 hydroxy 7 3 methyl 2 butenyl pyrimido 2,1 f purine 2,4,8 1H,3H,9H trione or sodium salt of 1 ,3 dimethyl 9 4 fluorobenzyl 6 hydroxy 7 3 methyl 2 butenyl pyrimido 2,1 f purine 2,4,8 1H,3H,9H trione.
