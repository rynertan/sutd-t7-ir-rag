# Human leukocyte interferons, process for their microbial production, intermediates therefor and compositions containing them.

## Abstract
Mature human leukocyte interferon species K and L, useful in the treatment of viral and neoplastic diseases, and their preparation by recombinant DNA technology as well as the means used in this process, i.e. recombinant DNA molecules coding for the amino acid sequences of said interferons, vectors capable of expressing said interferons in microbial host organisms and host organisms transformed with these vectors.
