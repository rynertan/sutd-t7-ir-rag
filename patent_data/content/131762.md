# Agricultural chemical preparation in the form of aqueous suspension.

## Abstract
An agricultural chemical preparation in the form of aque ous suspension is proposed, which preparation comprises at least one active ingredient, at least one nonionic surfactant having an HLB value of 11 or less, a thickener and the balance of water, provided that the active ingredient is hardly soluble or insoluble in water and soluble or miscible in the nonionic surfactant at ordinary or elevated temperatures. The prepara tion is excellent is stability of the active ingredient, spreadabil ity and residual effect, and usable without any risk of inflam mation or toxicity to mammals, because of using no organic solvents.
