# Pulse radar apparatus.

## Abstract
In a pulse radar apparatus target returns are detected, sampled, digitised per range quant and frequency analysed. The apparatus comprises a cell classification unit 5 for deriving from the spectrum range of the target returns a cell classification signal, whose logical values indicate that the target returns within a radar cell are classified, in the first instance, as first trace and multiple trace signals. In a microprocessor 12 the cells, which collectively cover one single target, are combined to form a cluster, while a signal representative of the target covered by the cluster is determined. Furthermore in the microprocessor 12 a cluster classification signal is derived, whose logical values indicate that the target returns within the cluster are classified as first trace and multiple trace signals. The signal representative of the target covered by the cluster is read out if it is derived from target returns classified as first trace echoes.
