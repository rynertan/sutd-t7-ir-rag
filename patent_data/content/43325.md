# Hydrophilic material for sorbing heavy metals, method for making such material and its use.

## Abstract
The hydrophilic material can be used as a filter or ion exchanger to sorb heavy metal ions, such as silver, mercury, lead, copper and cadmium, from aqueous solutions, the material having incorporated in a cellulose ester a high surface area zinc sulfide of at least 15 m² g and preferably at least 25 m² g and a method of making a hydrophilic material for sorbing heavy metals by incorporating high surface area zinc sulfide or zinc oxide into a cellulose ester material by slurry process and converting the zinc oxide so incorporated into high surface area zinc sulfide.
