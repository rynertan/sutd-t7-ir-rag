## Description
PREPARATION OF IMMUNOGENS CONSISTING OF ANTIGENICDETERMINANTS BOUND TO GLYCOSIDE CONTAINING CARRIERS. The invention relates to the preparation of immunogens consisting of antigenic determinants bound to a carrier and vaccines which contain these immunogens. Immunisation is employed extensively as a way to protect man and animals against infections by pathogenic organisms such as viruses, bacteria, parasites and the like. Active immunisation, which provides long lasting protection, is preferred.Active immunisation is effected by introducing antigens of the pathogenic organism into the individual to be protected. Mostly this is done by inoculation with inactivated or attenuated strains of the pathogen. Inoculation with inactivated strains has the disadvantage that the immunizing power is often rather low due to the partial denaturation of the antigens which occurs during inactivation. Inoculation with attenuated strains of the pathogens entails the risk of a certain pathogenicity of these strains. Hence, a safer and more efficient method of active immunization is desired. One possibility is, for example, inoculation with preparations which exclusively contain antigens instead of the complete pathogenic organisms. In this case, the achievement of very high purity, and in particular the complete removal of, for example, viral genetic material, is often difficult to attain. As more information continues to become available on the primary and spatial structure of the antigens, ways have been sought of using antigen fragments which are as small as possible, the so called antigenic determinants, as immunogens for active immunization. An antigenic determinant is a part of the antigen which can act as a recognition site for a particular type of immunoglobulin directed against the antigen.When split dff from the complete antigen, such small fragments are often easier to purify than the antigen itself, and are even small enough to permit their synthetic preparation. However, it is found that inoculation with freely dissolved antigenic determinants results in much too low a level of immunization. Significantly better immunization has been achieved by inoculation with an immunogen wherein antigenic determinants are bound to a carrier.Specifically, known carriers for this purpose are immunogenic macromolecules such as tetanus toxoid, key hole limpet haemocyanin KLH , multi poly DL alanyl poly L lysine and copolymers ofD aminoacids. The antigenic determinants, thus rendered more strongly immunogenic, are however still somewhat less immunogenic than, for example, the antigens in their natural form, from which the antigenic determinants in question are derived.Moreover, the macromolecular carriers employed therein are less suitable for human administration and, for example, KLH is commercially of little interest because the material is so expensive. There have now been found novel immunogens with antigenic determinants which appear to possess substantially better immunizing power than the immunogens wherein the carriers hitherto known are present. The carriers employed in the immunogens according to the invention are moreover non pyrogenic and commercially more attractive than the known macromolecular carriers. The immunogen according to the invention is prepared by contacting an antigenic determinant bonded to a hydrophobic residual group with a solution of glycosides having both a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic part, and present in an amount of at least the critical micelle concentration, under conditions wherein complexes are formed between the glycoside micelles and the hydrophobic residual groups, whereafter the resulting immunogenic particles are optionally stabilized and or protected against digestive degradation. Any glycoside having a hydrophobic part and a hydrophilic part can be used as the glycoside.Preferably, saponins are used, such as those described by Tschesche and Wulf, Chemie undBiologie der Saponine in Fortschritte der Chemie organischer Naturstoffe, edited by W. Herz,H. Grisebach and G.W. Kirby, Vol. 30 1973 and in particular the highly polar saponins, and especially the polar triterpene saponins such as the polar acidic bis desmosides, for example saponin extract from Quillaja bark, araloside A, Chikusetsu saponin IV, Calendula glycoside C,Chikusetsu saponin V, Achyranthes saponin B,Calendula glycoside A, araloside B, araloside C,Putranjia saponin III, Bersama saponiside,Putranjia saponin IV, thrichoside A, trichosideB, saponaside A, trichoside C, gypsoside, nutanoside, dianthoside C, saponaside X, aescine from Aesculus hippocastonum or sapoalbin fromGypsophilla struthium, and in particular saponin extract from Quillaja saponaria Molina, preferably the DQ extract prepared by the method of K. Dalsgaard 1tsaponin Adjuvants, Bull.Off.int.Epiz 77 7 8 , 1289 1295 1972 and Quil A prepared by the method of K. Dalsgaard SaponinAdjuvants III , Archiv f√ºr die gesamte Virusforschung 44, 243 254 1974 . Mixtures of glycosides may also be used. Antigenic determinants suitable for preparing immunogens according to the invented process are for example small polypeptides, small oligosaccharides, oligonucleotides, glycoprotein fragments and haptens. With small polypeptides are meant here polypeptides comprising at least 4 up to about 40 amino acids. In general an antigenic determinant comprises not more than 4 8 amino acids. Sometimes, however, a somewhat larger number of amino acids is needed in order to ensure the specific spatial structure of the antigenic determinant where appropriate, these extra amino acids can belong to the hydrophobic residual group. The polypeptides can for example be prepared synthetically on the basis of a known amino acid sequence, or can be obtained by proteolytic or chemical cleavage of larger polypeptides or proteins such as membrane proteins of microorganisms or proteins of plant or animal origin or can be a polypeptide hormone or a fragment or analog thereof. With small oligosaccharides in general are meant linear or branched chains of sugar units comprising at least 4 and up to about 20 sugar units, and more favorably between 6 and 10 sugar units. These oligosaccharides can be prepared synthetically or by chemical or enzymatic degradation of naturally occuring polysaccharides or glycoproteins. With oligonucleotides are meant compounds consisting of at least 1 up to about 15 ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides which are obtained synthetically or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of polynucleotides such as RNA and DNA. Optionally these oligonucleotides may be doublestranded. Glycoprotein fragments are prepared synthetically or by chemical and enzymatic cleavage of glycoproteins. With haptens are meant molecules different from the polypeptides, oligosaccharides, oligonucleotides and glycoprotein fragments mentioned before and which are not suited for the induction of antibody formation unless bonded to a carrier.Examples of these are steroids and prostaglandines. As hydrophobic residual group can be used any chemical group with hydrophobic character.Examples of these are hydrophobic polypeptides, or aliphatic chains, or fatty acid derivatives, or phospholipid derivatives. The hydrophobic polypeptides can preferably comprise 4 50 amino acids and can in particularly consist of hydrophobic amino acid residues, such as valyl, phenylalanyl, tryptophyl, methionyl, leucyl and or isoleucyl residues. Inter alia in the interests of appropriate solubility, for example in the course of the synthesis, it may be necessary to include a number of additional non hydrophobic amino acids in the hydrophobic residual group. The hydrophobic polypeptides have the advantage that they are easy to couple synthetically to antigenic determinants, and specifically when using synthetically prepared polypeptide antigenic determinants it is an advantage that the synthesis of the hydrophobic residual group and the antigenic determinant can be carried out as one total operation. Suitable aliphatic chains as hydrophobic residual groups are branched or straight hydrocarbon chains such as stearyl or palmityl. Suitable also are groups derived from glycerol esters of branched or straight chain hydrocarbons, such as phosphatidyl derivatives. The invention also includes the preparation of immunogens which comprise various types of antigenic determinants. These can be different antigenic determinants which are characteristic of one and the same pathogen, if desired for different serotypes of one and the same pathogen, or different antigenic determinants which are characteristic of different pathogens. The preparation of immunogens according to the invention can be carried out in numerous possible ways. Stated in general terms a solution of antigenic determinants to which hydrophobic radicals are.coupled and to which, if desired for improvement of the solubility, a solubilizing agent, e.g.a detergent is added, is brought into contact with a glycoside solution which contains at least one glycoside which is composed of one hydrophobic and one hydrophilic part, in an amount at least equal to the critical micelle concentration, and at the same time or subsequently any solubilizing agent if present is removed. Such a preparation can be carried out by dialysing or subjecting to ultrafiltration a solution of the antigenic determinants coupled to the hydrophobic residual groups, together with a solubilizing agent, in the presence of the said glycoside solution. Specifically for the large scale preparation of the immunogen according to the invention, ultrafiltration is a very suitable method. However, it is also possible to prepare the immunogens by introducing a solution of the antigenic determinants, coupled to the hydrophobic residual groups, in the presence of solubilizing agent, onto a density gradient of, for example, sugar solutions or salt solutions, to which such an amount of glycoside containing a hydrophobic part and a hydrophilic part is added that the concentration is at least equal to the critical micelle concentration, and thereafter introducing the whole into a centrifugal force field, whereby the immunogen is separated out as a band. Alternatively the antigenic determinant, coupled to the hydrophobic residual groups, may be sonicated in a solution also containing glycosides having a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic part in an amount of at least the critical micelle concentration, whereafter the complexes formed arse isolated from the medium. The immunogens according to the invention can be stabilized, if desired. This can be done, for example, by linking to themselves, or to one another, the antigenic determinants and or the hydrophobic residual groups bonded thereto cross linking . The cross linking can be established by any reagent possessing reactive groups and which are able to bond to at least two groups on the antigenic determinant and or on the hydrophobic residual group. For the cross linking on polypeptides generally use is made of glutaraldehyde or formaldehyde. Suitable cross linking reagents are also homobifunctional reagents such as bisamidates, bisuccinimidyl esters or hetero bifunctional reagents such as compounds which contain an azidophenyl group and an amidate or a succinimidyl or an activated fluorobenzene or a haloketone group . The immunogen according to the invention is in particular suitable for vaccination. A vaccine containing the said immunogen can inter alia be used for immunization against a particular pathogen, for so called priming wherein the body is not immediately stimulated to form specific free antibodies but is effectively preconditioned so that, following infection or vaccination, for example with inactivated or attenuated pathogens, a strong immunization reaction is brought about see, inter alia, Emini et al. 1983 Nature 304, 699 703 , or for immunological sterilization or castration whereby antibodies against substances vital to reproductive processes, such as certain hormones, are produced . The invention therefore also includes vaccines which contain immunogens according to the invention. Such vaccines can be suitable for immunization or priming against a particular pathogen, with at least one type of antigenic determinant characteristic of the particular pathogen being present in the immunogen. A plurality of types of antigenic determinants of one and the same pathogen can also be present in the vaccine.At the same time it is possible for each immunogen to comprise a plurality of these antigenic determinants, or for each of the types of antigenic determinants to be present in separate immunogens.It is also possible, according to the invention, to compose vaccines for a plurality of pathogens, and in that case, once again, the respective antigenic determinants can be present in separate immunogens or conjointly in one immunogen. The immunogens according to the invention can accordingly also be used in diagnostic tests, for example as a solid phase in an agglutination test, or as a marker phase in an immunochemical test in the case of the last mentioned use, the marker is, or can be, included in the immunogen. To use the immunogen according to the invention for vaccination purposes, the immunogen must be brought into a suitable form for administration. For intramuscular qr subcutaneous administration, the immunogens can, for example, be mixed with physiological salt solution. For intranasal or intra ocular administration, for example in the form of a spray, an aqueous solution will also preferably be used. For local for example oral administration it will in many cases be necessary for use a form which temporarily protects the immunogens for example against saccharolytic enzymes in the oral cavity or against proteolytic enzymes in the stomach .Such protection may for example be effected by encapsulating the immunogens or by bringing them into a slow release form or by using one or more aminoacids in the D form on enzyme sensitive sites of the antigenic determinants and or hydrophobic residual groups. By encapsulation is meant any method by which the pharmaceutical is temporarily protected against attack by certain desintegrating influences. Encapsulation may be established by covering any individual complex according to the invention with a protecting agent micro capsules , or by encasing a multitude of complexes into a single protecting shield macro capsules . The encapsulating material may be semipermeable or may become semi permeable if brought within the animal or human body or upon attaining certain sites within the animal or human body. In this way both encapsulation and sustained release may be established by a single pharmaceutical preparation. For the encapsulation, therefore, generally a biodegradable material is used. For the micro encapsulation suitably the optionally cross linked complexes according to the invention are dispersed into a solution of a biodegradable polymer, to which, optionally, surfactants are added. Consequently the polymer is to build a capsule at the interface. The microcapsules are separated and may be suspended into a physiologically acceptable medium. Alternatively the micro capsules may be lyophylized. Macro encapsulation can be established by methods known in the art. Suitably the optionally cross linked, complexes according to the invention are converted into an appropriate formulation compatible with oral soft or hard capsules material, such as gelatine, starch, etc. To this end the complexes to which are added for example mannitol, sucrose, glycerol, etc., may be dried or freeze dried, whereafter the material can be granulated or suspended into for example a natural or synthetic gel and filled into capsules which have been enteric coated by, for example, formaldehyde, cellulose acetate phtalate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phtalate or polyacrylic compounds.Alternatively enteric coated capsules are covered internally with a soft hydrophobic layer such as polysiloxane or synthetic or vegetable oils or waxes, prior to filling with the complexes according to the invention in aqueous suspended form.
