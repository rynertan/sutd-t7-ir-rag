## Description
Improved Process for the Preparation of 2 Methyl 3 o tolyl 7 Chloro 1,2,3,4 Tetrahydro 4 oxo 6 Quinazolinesulfonamide Background of the Invention The present invention relates to the preparation of 2 methyl 3 o tolyl 7 chloro 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro 4oxo 6 quinazolinesulfonamide I and, more particularly, to an improved process for the final step of the multistage synthesis in which the corresponding benzamide 11 precursor, 2 amino 4 chloro 5 sulfamoyl N o tolyl benzamide it , is reacted with an aldehyde or acetal to obtain ring closure. United States Patent Nos. 3,360,518 3,567,746 3,761,480 and 3,862,949 disclose and claim compound I and other 3 aryl 7 halo 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro 4 oxo 6 quinazolinesulfonamide compounds which have been found to be useful as diuretics, and or methods by which such compounds can be prepared. The specification and claims of these patents are specifically incorporated herein by reference. According to U. S. Patent No. 3,862,949, compound 11 is prepared by reacting a 5 chloro 2 methyl aniline with a lower alkyl haloformate to produce an N carbalkoxy 5 chloro 2 methyl aniline, reacting said aniline with halosulfonic acid and ammonium hydroxide to produce a N carbalkoxy 5 chloro 2 methyl 4 sulfamoylaniline, reacting said aniline with potassium permanganate to produce N carbethoxy 5 chloro 4 sulfa moylanthranilic acid, reacting said anthranilic acid with a cyclizing and condensing agent such as thionyl chloride to produce 7 chloro 6 sulfamoylisatoic anhydride, reacting said isatoic anhydride with o toluidine to produce 2 amino 4 chloro 5 sulfamoyl N o tolyl benzamide 11 and reacting said benzamide with a suitable cyclizing agent such as an acetal, aldehyde or ketone to produce the desired compound. The foregoing synthesis route involves 6 basic reactions which are illustrated by equations 1 through 7 on the bottom half of page 4 columns 5 and 6 and the top half of page. 5 columns 7 and 8 of the printed specifications of U. S. Patent No. 3,862,949. It will of course be obvious to those skilled in the art that these equations illustrate only the 6 basic reactions of the synthesis route, and that each specific reaction may in fact involve more than a single step. For example, equation No. 6 of U. S. Patent 3,862,949 illustrates reaction of the benzamide 11 with dimethyl acetal to obtain ring closure, the reaction being carried out column 11, lines 16 seq ofU. S. Patent No. 3,862,949 in glacial acetic acid, at ambient temperature, for a period of three and a half hours, after which the crude product was recovered by filtration and washed. In a separate series of crystallization and concentration procedures, the crude product was recrystallized from 95 ethanol to finally obtain the desired product. Example 34 of U. S. Patent No. 3,761,480 describes preparation of the 2 ethyl 3 m tolyl homologue of compound I prepared in the process of the present invention, employing cold ethanol as the solvent. The experiment is reported to have produced only a 47 yield of product. In repeating the procedure of the preceding experiment in an attempt to synthesize the corresponding 2 methyl 3 o tolyl quinazolinone compound, which is prepared in this invention, there was no product after four hours, and only a trace yield of product after letting the reaction continue overnight. Summary of the Invention The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of compound I as illustrated by equation 6 of U. S. Patent No. 3,862,949 wherein the benzamide precursor II is reacted with acetaldehyde or an acetal of the formula CH3CH OR 2, wherein R is a hydrocarbon group, to form the desired end product I . In the improved process of the present invention, the reaction is carried out at an elevated temperature in the presence of ethanol or isopropanol and of an acid having a negative pKa. Acetaldehyde as used herein includes both acetaldehyde and paraldehyde. R is preferably a lower alkyl group such as methyl or ethyl. By elevated temperature is meant a temperature of from at least about 40 C to about 85 C. A stoichiometric excess normally about 3 50 , preferably about 10 20 of the aldehyde or acetal is usually employed. The ethanol normally employed is either absolute or an aqueous ethanol of at least 80 concentration, preferably 95 About 2.5 to 20 ml. of ethanol per gram of benzamide are normally used, preferably about 2.7 to 9 ml. g. Similar quantities of isopropanol can be employed, with the isopropanol used normally being absolute isopropanol, although 70 isopropanol is also useful. The process of the present invention eliminates the acetic acid heretofore employed and also renders optional use of the separate recrystallization step heretofore required. In addition, it has been found that by employing one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the volume of alcohol required as the reaction medium is substantially less than than which was heretofore required merely for recrystallization, and the yield of pure end product based on the starting benzamide is significantly higher. As indicated above, the process of the present invention is carried out at a temperature of from at least about 400C to the boiling point reflux temperature of the alcohol, but preferably at or near the boiling point of the alcohol, normally for a period of from about 0.25 to about five hours, in the presence of an acid having a negative pKa. The molar equivalent of acid to benzamide should be from about 1 10 to 10 1, preferably from 1 4 to 4 1. The product is recovered by conventional means, such as by cooling the solution and filtering the crystallized product, An additional increase in yield can often be obtained by first concentrating the solution, usually by evaporating a portion of the alcohol.Preferred Embodiment In one of the preferred processes of the present invention, the benzamide is suspended in either isopropanol or ethanol. Acid and the aldehyde or acetal are added to the suspension to form a reaction mixture which is then heated and maintained at reflux for a period from about 15 minutes to about four hours, after which the solution is filtered hot and the filtrate concentrated until the volume is from about 10 to about 50 of the original volume of the reaction mixture. Additional aldehyde or acetal is then added normally about 1 20 stoichiometric equivalent, preferably about 10 12 , and the reaction mixture is refluxed for a further period from about 15 minutes to about one hour, after which the reaction mixture is allowed to cool and the solid product is filtered and washed. In another preferred embodiment, the benzamide is suspended in either isopropanol or ethanol the aldehyde or acetal is added and the reaction mixture is heated to reflux and maintained at reflux, while the acid is added to the hot reaction mixture. In another preferred embodiment, the benzamide is suspended in isopropanol the aldehyde is added followed by the acid and the reaction mixture is heated to reflux for about 1 hr. and then the reaction mixture is allowed to cool and the solid product is filtered and washed. The following examples will serve by way of illustration and not by way of limitation to describe the process of the present invention and its advantages over the process heretofore employed. As used in the following examples, unless otherwise clearly apparent from the context, ethanol shall be understood to be 95 denatured ethanol and all yields are based on the total amount of 2 amino 4 chloro 5 sulfamoyl N o tolyl benzamide starting material.Prior Art MethodPreparation of 2 methyl 3 o tolyl 7 chloro 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro 4 oxo 6 guinazolinesulfonamide 2 amino 4 chloro 5 sulfamoyl N o tolyl benzamide 685 g. was slurried in 7000 ml. glacial acetic acid.To this slurry was added 240 g. 280 ml. dimethyl acetal and 4 ml. concentrated sulfuric acid. The reaction mixture was stirred for 3i hours, then filtered and washed thoroughly with ether. The yield of crude material was 664 g., and it melted at 252 253 C. This was combined with 622 g. of a crude from an identical run and recrystallized from 30 liters of 95 ethanol by dissolving hot, cooling, and concentratingto 12 liters under reduced pressure at 300C. Weight of the first crop 1033 g. This solid was recrystallized from 95 ethanol 25 liters to give a first crop of 685 g.Yield 46.4 m.p. 246 2500C. The filtrates from the two recrystallizations were concentrated down to half volume, and a further 251 g. product was obtained. Concentration of this filtrate to half volume gave another 196 g. product which was recrystallized again from 4500 ml. 95 ethanol, by concentration to half volume at 300C under vacuum, yielding 151 g. of product. This portion was combined with the 251 g. portion obtained above to give a combined wieght of 402 g. Yield 27.3 m. p. 247 2520C. The total weight of final product was 1087 g. Yield 73.7 Example 1 To a suspension of 203.4 g. 0.6M of 2 amino 4chloro 5 sulfamoyl N o tolyl benzamide 1632 ml. of 95 ethanol was added 29.1 g. 0.22M a 10 molar excess of paraldehyde and 60 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The reaction mixture was brought to reflux and solution occurred within 30 minutes. The hot solution was filtered in portions into a 1 liter round bottomed flask and concentrated to 540 ml. total volume. The condenser was placed upright, 3.04 g. of paraldehyde 0.023M a further 15 molar excess of aldehyde was added and the mixture was refluxed for one hour. The heat was then turned off and the pot temperature was allowed to drift down slowly to 220C.The solid was then filtered off actual volume of filtrate 380 ml. The solid was washed with 2 x 60 ml. portions of cold ethanol. The product, dried at room temperature, weighed 198 g. 90 , m. p. 256 2600c. Comparing the prior art method described above, with the preferred embodiment illustrated in Example 1, it will be seen that in the prior art method 14 ml. of acetic acid and 60 ml. of ethanol are used to produce 1 gm. of end product, while in the method of Example 1 no acetic acid and less than 10 ml. of ethanol are used per gram of end product. In addition there is 22 improvement in yield, or a 16 increase in yield based on the starting benzamide. An improvement is also seen in Example 7 below 80 yield v. 73.3 in the prior art method even though the concentration step which should increase yield was omitted. These differences are more clearly apparent from an examination of Table I which sets forth the reagents used per gram of end product for,the known prior art method described above and the process of Example 1. Table 1 Reagent g. of Product Reagent Prior Art Process Example 1 95 ethanol 33 ml. 8.8 ml.acetic acid 6.8 ml.chloroform 2.6 ml.methanol 0.8 ml.conc. hydrochloric acid 0.03 ml. 0.3 ml.paraldehyde 0.2 ml. 0.16 ml. Thus, the amount of alcohol in Example 1 is 27 of that used in the prior art process. The paraldehyde is reduced by 20 , and acetic acid, chloroform and methanol are all eliminated. Because concentrated hydrochloric acid is relatively inexpensive, the increased HC1 is of no consequence. The following examples were conducted in a manner similar to that set forth in Example 1.Example 2 To 80.0 g. 0.235 mole of 2 amino 4 chloro 5 sulfamoyl N o tolyl benzamide was added 640 ml. ethanol and 25 ml. water, followed by 11.2 g. of acetaldehyde instead of paraldehyde and 6 ml. conc.

The reaction mixture was refluxed for one and a half hours, filtered and the resulting solution was concentrated by distillation to a volume of 160 ml. 2.6 g. of acetaldehyde was added and the temperature was maintained with stirring for 15 minutes. The product was filtered and washed with 60 ml. hot ethanol instead of cold ethanol. Yield 70 g. 81 Example 3 To 80.0 g. 0.235 mole of 2 amino 4 chloro 5 sulfamoyl N o tolyl benzamide was added 640 ml. ethanol and 25 ml. water, followed by 11.2 g. of paraldehyde and 12 ml. conc.

Yield 67 g. 69 Example 5 To 20 g. 0.06 M of 2 amino 4 chloro 5 sulfamoyl N o tolyl benzamide was added 160 ml. of absolute ethanol and 6.25 ml. water, followed by 5.7 g. 1,1 dimethoxyethane and a solution of 1.5 ml. conc. sulfuric acid in 4 ml. of water. The reaction mixture was refluxed for one hour, and the near clear solution was filtered. The filtrate was concentrated by distillation to a volume of 50 ml., maintained at temperature for 15 minutes, then filtered and washed with 40 ml. hot 95 ehtanol.Yield 16.5 g. 77 Example 6 To 20 g. 0.06M of 2 amino 4 chloro 5 sulfamoyl N o tolyl benzamide was added 150 ml. of absolute ethanol followed by 5.7 g. of 1,1 dimethoxyethane and 4 ml. of conc. hydrochloric acid. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 30 minutes, filtered, then refluxing was continued during which time solid was formed. The solid which formed after one hour was filtered off, washed with 25 ml. hot 95 ethanol, then dried. Yield 6.5 g. 31 . Note the short reflux time.Example 7 To 20.3 g. 0.06M of 2 amino 4 chloro 5 sulfamoyl N o tolyl benzamide was added 100 ml. of absolute ethanol followed by 8.5 g. of 1,1 dimethoxyethane and 20 ml. conc. HC1. The mixture was refluxed, filtered when solution occurred, then refluxing was continued for one and a half hours. Additional solid formed during the course of heating. The reaction was cooled to 150C, treated with 40 ml. water to precipitate additional product, stirred one half hour, then the solid was filtered off. Yield 17.5 g. 80 . Sulfuric acid pKa 3 , hydrochloric acid pKa 6.11 , hydrobromic acid pKa 9 , p toluenesulfonic acid pKa 1.34 and methanesulfonic pKa 1.2 were all successfully employed in the process of the present invention, while phosphoric acid pKa 2.5 , succinic acid pKa 4.21 , and acetic acid pKa 4.76 did not provide a significant yield of product. Examples 8 and 9 illustrate another preferred embodiment of the present invention.Example 8 To 30.6 g. 0.09 mole of 2 amino 4 chloro 5sulfamoyl N o tolyl benzamide was added 80 ml. of 95 ethanol and 4.5 ml. 0.034 mole of paraldehyde. The mixture was blanketed with nitrogen and then brought to reflux with stirring. With the pot temperature of 70 C, 9 ml. of conc. hydrochloric acid was added all at once.Complete solution occurred after 2.5 minutes and was maintained for 3 minutes before the product started to crystallize. The mixture was refluxed for 45 minutes and then allowed to cool to room temperature approx.1.5 hours . After stirring 3 hours at room temperature, the product was filtered and washed with 25 ml. 95 ethanol. Yield 30.1 g. 91.4 . On recrystallization from ethanol a 92 yield was obtained thereby resulting in an overall yield of 83.7 .Example 9 The procedure of Example 8 was repeated but the mixture was only heated to a temperature of about 400C.A 92 recovery of impure product was obtained this comprised approximately 20 starting benzamide and 72 quinazolinone end product. In the embodiment illustrated by Example 8, recrystallization is generally preferred. Even in the embodiment illustrated by Examples 1 7, a recrystallization is often desirable to remove trace impurities or promote recovery of a greater portion of the product in a particular monocrystalline form. Example 10 To a suspension of 16.3 g. 0.048 m of 2 amino 4chloro 5 sulfamoyl N o tolyl benzamide in isopropyl alcohol 136 ml with 3.5 ml 0.026 m of paraldehyde was added at reflux 9 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid over a 2 minute period solution occurs during the addition. The reaction was maintained at reflux for 15 min, then the temperature was allowed to drift to 210C over a 4 hour period. The solid which formed was filtered off, washed with 100 ml. isopropanol, then vacuum dried for 12 hours. The white crystalline product 15.8 g. represents a 90 recovery of crude. A second crop 1.4 g. was recovered by concentrating the filtrate.Yield 17.2 g. 98.0 Example 11 To a suspension of 10.0 g. 0.029 m. of 2 amino 4chloro 5 sulfamoyl N o tolyl benzamide in 70 isopropanol 100 ml. with 2.0 g. 0.016 m of paraldehyde was added at reflux 5 ml. of conc.hydrochloric acid. The reaction was kept at reflux for 2 hours with complete solution occurring during the reflux period. The mantle was removed, and the reaction was allowed to drift to 220C. over 4 hours. The solid was filtered off, isopropanol washed, then air dried.The recovered product 8.7 g. represents 81 recovery of crude. A second crop 2.0 g. was recovered on concentrating and cooling the filtrate. Yield 10.7 g. 99.6 L . Example 12 This is the most preferred method according to this invention. 300 g. 0.88 m of 2 amino 4 chloro 5 sulfamoyl N o tolyl benzamide was added to 785 ml. of isopropanol. The mixture was blanketed with nitrogen, then 49 ml. of paraldehyde was added, followed by 88 ml.of conc. HC1. The reaction is taken to reflux with a solution resulting within 15 minutes. Reflux is carried on for a total of 45 minutes, then the heating mantle is removed and the mixture is allowed to drift to room temperature 2 hours . Stirring is continued for 5 hours after the removal of the mantle. The solid is then filtered off, washed with 245 ml. isopropanol, then air dried. The yield is 283 g. 88 m.p. 255 2580C. The next step was to dissolve 283 g. of crude product in 6257 ml. of hot 95 ethanol which has been denatured with 31 ml. of toluene 6226 ml. 95 ethanol plus 31 ml. toluene . The hot solution and concentrate were filtered keeping the solution hot. It was then added continuously to a 2 liter concentration flask, maintaining it 3 4 full during the concentration. Efficient agitation is maintained to prevent dense crystals from settling to the bottom. 5400 ml. of solvent was distilled followed by the removal of heat to allow the crystals to come to room temperature over a 3 hour period. The product was then filtered off, washed with 300 ml. of denatured 95 ethanol, and air dried.The product weighed 254.4 g. 90 m.p 255 2560C. It will, of course, be obvious to those skilled in the art that many changes and substitutions can be made in the specific materials, reactants and procedural steps set forth hereinbefore, without departing from the scope of the present invention, and it is my intention to be limited only by the appended claims.
