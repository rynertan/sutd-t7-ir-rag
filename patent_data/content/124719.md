# Current type GTO inverter.

## Abstract
In a current type GTO inverter, commutation surge vol tage is inevitably generated from an inductive load whenever each GTO is turned off. The commutation surge voltage thus generated is once stored in a capacitor C₁ through a diode surge voltage rectifier 5 and then restored or regenerated to the DC source terminals 3A, 3B of the GTO bridge connected inverter 3 through a pair of other GOTs G₇, G₈ turned on only when the capacitor voltage exceeds a predetermined value beyond the DC source voltage. After energy restoration, magnetic energy stored in a reactor Lr₁, Lr₂ is recharged in the same capacitor C₁ . The necessary elements are a capacitor C₁ , two GTOs G₇, G₈ , two diodes D₈, D₉ and a DC reactor 7 , thus simplifying the circuit configuration and reducing the cost. Additionally, since no vibration circuits to turn off thyristors for restoring the energy charged in the capacitor C₁ to the GTO bridge connected 3 inverter are required, the circuit operation is stable at higher frequency range, in particular.
