# GRIPPER MEANS FOR MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS

## Abstract
Gripper means on each of a pair of gripping parts 1 of a gripping tool, particularly a medical instrument, wherein the teeth 3 and the interstices 5 on one side of an imaginary longitudinal median line 2 form a surface relief pattern which is substantially duplicated by the teeth 4 and interstices 6 on the other side of the line 2 , but in the reverse sense, so that imaginary folding of the whole surface along the median line 2 will result in a substantial mating fit between teeth 3, 4 on one side of the line 2 and interstices 5, 6 on the other side of the line 2 . Preferably the teeth 3, 4 extend at the same angle on the two sides of the longitudinal median line 2 of the part, the teeth 3 on one side being staggered relative to those 4 on the other side. Desirably the gripping parts 1 are of substantially identical construction so that a substantial mating fit is provided between the teeth 3, 4 and interstices 5, 6 of one of the pair of gripping parts 1 with the corresponding teeth and interstices of the other gripping part when the two gripping parts are brought together in use.
