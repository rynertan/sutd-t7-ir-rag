# A dual linkage remote shifter apparatus.

## Abstract
A dual push pull cable controlled remote gearshift mechanism in which a control shaft 22 is rocked about one axis to swing one cable actuator member 32 and is rocked about a second axis transverse to the first to swing a second cable actuator member, with the coupling 42 and 44 between the first cable 16 and the first actuator member 32 being substantially aligned with the transverse axis and offset from the longitudinal axis, and with the operating connection 54 and 56 between the second actuator member and the second cable 20 being substantially aligned with the longitudinal axis of the control shaft 22 and offset from the transverse axis thereof. In the receiver unit 18, first and second coaxially interengaged shifter members 94 and 96 are coupled to the respective cables 16 and 20 through lever type actuated members 78 and 88, one through a form of coupling that shifts one such shifter member axially in relation to the other, and the other coupling being such as to rotate the shifter members conjointly through the first shifter member in any of its axially shifted positions.
