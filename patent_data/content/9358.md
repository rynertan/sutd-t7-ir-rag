# Control mechanisms for vehicle braking systems.

## Abstract
A control mechanism is provided for a vehicle braking system of the kind in which a pair of pressure modulating valves 18 have their performance modified during vehicle cornering only so that the brake on the inboard wheel receives less pressure than the brake on the outboard wheel. The control mechanism comprises a member 21 which has four points 22, 23, 24, 25 forming the corners of a trapezium. The first two points 22, 23 , which are at the ends of one of the parallel sides of the trapezium, are connected to the suspension, the third point 24 is con nected to the valves 18 , whilst the fourth point 25 is constrained from vertical movement. During normal travel the member 21 rotates freely about the third and fourth points 24, 25 so that there is no input to the valves 18 . However, in cornering the vehicle roll causes the first and second points 22, 23 to move differently so that the third point 24 also tends to move so altering the performance of the valves 18 .
