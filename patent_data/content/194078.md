# ELECTROSURGICAL GENERATOR WITH IMPROVED CIRCUITRY FOR GENERATING RF DRIVE PULSE TRAINS

## Abstract
An electrosurgical generator 10 comprises a patient circuit which includes an active electrode 12 and a return electrode 14. Means 16 of generator 10 generates a pulse train and in cludes an MXN storage device U1 having M memory locations where M 1 and each location having N storage positions where N 1. The storage device stores at least one K bit bi nary signal which is sequentially put out from the storage device. An electrosurgical signal generating means which in response to the K bit binary signal generates an electrosurgical signal which is applied to the patient circuit.
