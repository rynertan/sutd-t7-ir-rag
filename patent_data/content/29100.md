## Description
Coating Composition Is This invention relates to a composition comprising a hydrolysable ester and a silyl groups containing compound which hardens in the presence of moisture.Compounds of the condensation type, which possess a hydrolytic group such as a hydroxy, an acetoxy, an alkoxy or an oxime group have been widely used for various technical fields such as paints, coatings, adhesives for rubbers or sealants. These compounds harden at room temperature either in the absence or in the presence of a catalyst when the hydrolytic group is properly selected.However, when the reactivity between the hydrolytic group and moisture is increased, the shelf stability tends to decrease.Besides, it is difficult to keep these compounds completely free from moisture when storing them, whether they are pure or contained in a mixture or solution in short, they gradually react with a trace of moisture and show an increase in viscosity. On the other hand, the penetration of moisture from the air into the compounds is inevitable when they are used very often and exposed repeatedly to the air.Moreover, there is a strong likelihood that adsorption moisture from the surface of pigments or fillers penetrates into the compounds when compositions are prepared by blending several compounds this sometimes causes gelation during blending if the moisture content becomes too high. Although the moisture adhering to such additives can be. removed by previous heat treatment, or by forming azeotropes in xylene, the respective process is actually not easily practicable.In view of these circumstances, the present inventors have intensively studied improvements of the shelf stability of compositions containing compounds with silyl groups and finally found that the shelflife can be increased by adding to the composition an ester which hydrolyses in the presence of traces of moisture.That is to say, the present invention concerns a composition comprising a hydrolysable ester and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of polyesters, vinyl polymers, diallyl phthalate compounds, and diallyl phthalate copolymers, all of which contain in their molecule at least one silyl group having the following general formulaEMI2.1 wherein R1 and R2 each represent a hydrogen atom or a monova lent hydrocarbon group with 1 to 10 carbon atoms selected from the group consisting of alkyl, aryl, and aralkyl X represents any group selected from the group consisting of alkoxy, hydroxy, acyloxy, aminoxy, phenoxy, thioalkoxy, and amino and a represents an integer from o to 2.When the silyl groups containing compound is a polyester, its molecular weight is preferably from 300 to 8,000 when the silyl groups containing compound is a vinyl polymer, its molecular weight is preferably from 300 to 10,000 . Examples 6f suitable vinyl polymers are polymers which contain an acrylic ester or a methacrylic ester. Examples of suitable diall phthalates are diallyl phthalate prepolymers with a molecular weight of not more than 20,000, and polymers contaning diallyl phthalate and an acrylic or methacrylic ester. In these copolymeres the content of diallyl phthalate is preferably from 5 to 100 mol .For example, trialkyl orthoformate, tetralkyl orthosilicate and the like may be used as the hydrolysable esters of the present invention.The silyl groups containing compound may be produced essentially through an additional reaction between a silicon hydride and a compound having terminal C C double bonds or C C double bonds in the side chains in the presence of a platinum catalyst. Examples of compounds with terminal C C double bonds or C C double bonds in the side chains are 1 polyesters, 2 vinyl polymers, 3 diallyl phthalate compounds, 4 diallyl phthalate copolymers and the like,all of which are suitable for producing paints, coatings, adhesives for rubbers, silane coupling agents or sealants.For example, polyesters having C C double bonds may be prepared by reacting a polyester with terminal hydroxy groups e.g., products sold under the tradename DESMOFEN manufactured by Nihon PolyurethaneCo., Ltd. with acrylic chloride in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride.Secondly, the polyesters may also be obtained by condensation polymerization, in which allyl glycidyl ether, replaced partially for the diol component, is reacted with a dibasic acid that is usually used in an ester condensation polymerization. Thirdly, the polyesters may be pre paredbytransesterification between a diallyl ester, such as diallyl phthalate, and a polyester whose molecule ends are hydroxy groups in the presence of an appropriate catalyst such as toluene sulfonic acid. In the fourth place, the polyesters may be produced by reacting an excess amount of a dibasic acid with a diol, and adding allyl, alcohol to the reaction system for esterification during or after the reaction.In the fifth place, the polyesters having allyl type C C double bonds in their molecule may be obtained by reacting acid anhydrides with epoxy compounds and allyl alcohol in the presence of salts of tertiary amines or quaternary ammonium salts and introducing allyl radicals into the reaction product while simultaneously controlling its molecular weight with the aid of an alcohol. In this reaction, the polyester can be prepared similarly by substituting allyl glycidyl ether for the epoxy compound.Polyesters with terminal acryloyl groups or methacryloyl groups may be produced according to known methods by condensation of a diol, a dibasic acid and an acrylic acid or methacrylic acid .Vinyl polymers with C C double bonds can be obtained by a radical homopolymerization of allyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate or the like or by copolymerization of vinyl compounds such as styrene, methyl styrene, acrylic acid, acrylic ester, methacrylic acid, methacrylic ester, acryl amide, vinyl acetate, ethylene, maleic anhydride and the like.The diallyl phthalate compounds having C C double bonds specified in this invention include diallyl phthalate prepolymers. Commercially available diallyl phthalate compounds may be used. Diallyl phthalate copolymers with C C double bonds may be prepared by copolymerizing diallyl phthalate with an acrylic ester or methacrylic ester inthe presence of catalysts such as azo or peroxide compounds in this case the number of C C double bonds can be controlled by varying the amount of the diallyl phthalate used in the reaction.Silanes, i.e. compounds containing at least one hydrogen atom bonded to a silicon atom, include silane halides, such as trichlorosilane, methyl dichlorosilane, dimethyl chorosilane, phenyl dichlorosilane, and the like, alkoxy silanes, such as trimethoxy silane, triethoxy silane, methyl dimethoxy silane, methyl diethoxy silane, phenyl dimethoxy silane, and the like, acyloxy silanes, such as methyl diacetoxy silane, phenyl diacetoxy silane, and the like, ketoximate silanes, such as bis dimethyl ketoximate methyl silane, bis cyclohexyl ketoximate methyl silane, and the like. When organohalogen silanes are used, they are substituted by other hydrolysable groups after hydrosilylation. Vinyl polymers with silyl groups are obtained by copolymerizing a silyl compound and a vinyl compound. , for instance vinyl trimethoxy silane, y methacryloxypropyl trimethoxy silane or y methacryloxypropyl methyldimethoxysilane and styrene, oc methyi styrene, acrylic acid, acrylic ester, methacrylic acid, methacrylic ester, acrylamide, vinyl acetate, ethylene or maleic anhydride. Polymers with silyl groups may also be produced by reacting an organic polymer having epoxy groups for instance an epoxy polymer or a copolymer of glycidyl methacrylate and a vinyl compound with aminopropyl trimethoxysilane, or else by reacting organic polymers such as a carboxylated polyester or a vinyl polymer with glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane.The hydrolysable esters of this invention are preferably trialkyl formates, more preferably trimethyl orthoformate, triethyl orthofdrmate, tripropyl orthoformate, tributyl orthoformate and tetralkyl orthosilicate, most preferably tetramethyl orthosilicate, tetraethyl orthosilicate, tetrapropyl orthosilicate and tetrabutyl orthosilicate.Such hydrolysable esters are more readily subject to hydrolysis than the compounds with condensable silyl groups when these two compounds are blended and stored in the presence of moisture. Therefore, the former prevents the latter from hydrolysis, which seems to be the reason for the improved shelf stability of the composition of the invention.In addition, it has already been disclosed in JapanesePatent Application No. 25728 1979 that the alcohols released from the esters by hydrolysis also improve the stability of the silyl groups containing compound. As a matter of fact, however, the rate of hydrolysis, the pH which influences the rate of hydrolysis, and the mechanical properties of the product vary depending on the type of ester used. In short, an alkyl orthoformate is easily hydrolysed in a slightly acidic medium therefore, it does not penetrate into the hardened matrix and is easily removed from the reaction system as a volatile component.Contrary thereto, a tetralkyl orthosilicate is hydrolysed in a slightly alkaline medium the hydrolysed product condenses with the silyl groups containing compound as a low molecular cross linking agent, which is effective to improve the solvent resistance and increases the hardness of the product.As mentioned above, addition of the hydrolysable ester improves the stability of the silyl groups containing compound. Moreover, it is the characteristic of the present invention that the hydrolysable esters hardly in fluence the hardening and curing rate of the composition, because they evaporate out of the reaction system as a volatile component, or enter into the matrix while hardening is taking place.The amount of the hydrolysable esters is not particularly limited in this invention and can be varied depending on the amount of moisture contained in the composition to be prepared. In most cases, the hydrolysable esters will do for the purpose when their amount exceeds 0.1 , preferably 0.5 . However, as the compound having hydrolysable silyl groups essentially tends to polymerize when exposed to moisture, it is preferred to take measures to minimize the penetration of moisture into the composition.From this standpoint, the amount of moisture should be reduced beforehand by dehydration to such an extent that the amount of the hydrolysable ester does not exceed 30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the silyl groups containing compound.The main chain of the compound having silyl groups in the side chains may have any structure provided that the compound is selected from the group consisting of polyesters, vinyl polymers, diallyl phthalate compounds, diallyl phthalate copolymers or acrylic polymers, the effect of improving the stability of the silyl groupscontaining compound by the hydrolysable esters does not depend on the type of the main chain structure.The compositions of this invention have the characteristic that they harden at either ambient or high temperatures and can be used as paints such as repair paints for car bodies or bumpers, metal primers, anti corrosive coats for bridges and construction materials, also as coating materials for galvanized iron, aluminum, glass, plastics, rubber and the like, and as adhesives. If desired, the composition of this invention can be mixed with pigments or fillers. The present invention will be explained more in detail in the following examples which, however, are not to limit the scope of this invention.The molecular weights stated in the examples were measured according to the g.p.c. method gel permeation column method .Example 1A l liter metal autoclave was charged with 148 g of phthalic anhydride, 46.4 g of propylene oxide, 22.8 g of allylglycidyl ether, 11.6 g of allyl alcohol, and 0.5 g cf dimethyl benzylamide. After the mixture had been reacted for 3 hours at 100 C, 46 g of propylene oxide were added to it, and the reaction was continued for 1 hour at 900C. An excess amount of propylene oxide was then removed and a polyester with a molecular weight of 1,200 was obtained.9.5 g of acetic anhydride were added to 100 g of this polyester and the mixture was maintained at 1200C for 2 hours. Then the excess amount of acetic anhydride was removed under reduced pressure. A mixture composed of 22.2 g of the polyester, 0.0035 g of chloroplatinic acid, and 8.65 g of methyl dichlorosilane was subjected to reaction at 80 C for 3 hours. Subsequently, an excess amount of methyl dichlorosilane was removed under reduced pressure to leave the product. Then 20 ml of methanol and 20 ml of methyl orthoformate were added to the residue.After reacting for 1 hour at room temperature, the silyl groups containing polyester was obtained by removing volatile products under reduced pressure.Example 2A solution prepared by dissolving 2 g of azo bisisobutyronitrile in a mixture of 30 g of styrene, 16 g of allyl methacrylate, 20 g of methyl methacrylate, 19 g of n butyl methacrylate, 14 g of n butyl acrylate, 2g of maleic an hydride and 2 g of n dodecyl mercaptan was added dropwise to 100 g of toluene at 90 C. After 10 hours reaction, a vinyl polymer with allyl type double bonds, whose molecular weight proved to be 8,000, was obtained. The infrared absorption spectrum of this substance showed the band attributable to the C C double bonds at 1648 cm 1. To 20 g of this vinyl polymer an isopropanol solution was added, which contained 0.0005 g of chloroplatinic acid and 1.5 g of methyl dixethoxysilane, and the reaction was conducted in a sealed reactor at 900C for 6 hours.The infrared absorption spectrum of this substance lacked the band at 1648 cm 1, which showed us the formation of the silyl groups containing vinyl polymer.Example 3The silyl groups containing diallyl phthalate copolymer was obtained through the same reaction as that in Example 2. In this case, however, the 16 g of allyl methacrylate were replaced by 31 g of diallyl phthalate. Example 4A solution prepared by dissolving 2 g of azo bisisobutyronitrile in a mixture of 30 g of styrene, 27 g of y meth acryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane, 20 g of methyl methacrylate, 19 g of n butyl methacrylate, 14 g of n butyl acrylate, 2 g of acrylamidd, 2g of n dodecyl mercaptan, 5 gof n butanol was added dropwise to 100 g of toluene at 1000C, and the reaction was conducted at 1000C for 10 hours. As a result of it, a vinyl polymer with silyl groups whose molecular weight was 9,000 was obtained.Example 5 100 g of diallyl phthalate prepolymer tradename DAP L , a product of Osaka Soda Co., Ltd., iodine value about 80 0.00001 g of chloroplatinic acid, and 1 g of hydroquinone were dissolved in 100 ml of toluene. 35 ml methyldieffsy silane were added to this solution and the reaction was conducted at 900C for 3 hours. As a result of it, a silyl groups containing diallyl phthalate prepolymer was obtained.Two hydrolysable esters trimethyl orthoformate and tetraethyl orthosilicate were added respectively to compounds each of the five silyl groups containing obtained accord ing to Examples 1 to 5. The solids content in each solution mixture was adjusted to 50 by adding toluene, and the moisture content was also set to 1,000 ppm. These closely prepared specimens were sealed in containers, respectively, and kept standing at 500C for the period of one month. The table shows the results of the shelf stability test by measuring the specific viscosities of the inventive compositions and of a control composition to which no hydrolysable ester had been added. The table also includes a blend of two hydrolysable esters. TableEMI11.1 Example SEP Hydrolysable SEP ester SEP pts. SEP b. SEP wt.
