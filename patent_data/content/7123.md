# High speed actuating mechanism.

## Abstract
A high speed actuating mechanism for operating the con tacts of a circuit interrupter has an operating shaft 73 con nected to the contacts and to an operating piston 90 . The operating piston 90 has a short circuited conductve ring or repulsion disc 160 which is closely coupled to a lenz coil operator 151 in one position of the actuating mechanism. The operating piston 90 also has an enlarged diameter seal ing protrusion 92 which seals against an annular seal 130 which is concentric with the lenz coil operator 151 and the sealing ring 130 are spring mounted to have several degrees of resiliency to enable proper relative location of the repulsion disc 160 and the lenz coil 151 and proper relative location of the annular seal 130 and contact protrusion 92 to control seal penetration and to enable compensation for contact ero sion when butt type contacts are used.
