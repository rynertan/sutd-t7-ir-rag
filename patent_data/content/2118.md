# Sealed sleeve pipe coupling.

## Abstract
A pipe coupling for use with adjacent pipe ends of a particular diameter, the coupling comprising a generally cylindrical sleeve adapted to overlie the adjacent pipe ends and having a sealing ring for engagement with the exterior surface of the pipe ends. In order to facilitate fitting and allow for deviations in the dimensions of the pipe ends, the sleeve is formed of a semi elastic material and has an intergral annular rib 25 in its longitudinal mid portion, the rib dividing the coupling into two sections each having an inner portion 27, 28 with circumferentially spaced integral ridges 30 formed thereon to engage the exterior surface of the pipe and an outer larger diameter portion 12, 13 accommodating the sealing ring 15, 16 which resiliently engages the outer surface of the pipe.
