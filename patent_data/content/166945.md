# Cylinder lock with key, incorporation a picking preventing means.

## Abstract
A cylinder lock with key, incorporating a picking prevent ing means, comprises a plug 3 mounted rotatably within the cylindrical seat 2 , of a lock cylinder 1 and has a first set of holes 13 lying on a radial plane. The holes accommodate pins 14 which cooperate with tumbler pins 9 accommo dated in a second set of holes 8 formed in the cylinder 1 and being aligned with the first set of holes. A longitudinal key slot 11 extends through the plug 3 which is in communication with the first set of holes 13 and has a longitudinal rib 15 arranged to project thereinto to provide support for the pins 14 . The rib conceals the ends of the pins resting thereon, and defines an intersection of the longitudinal key slot 11 with the cylindrical portions of said first set of holes 13 accommodating said pins 14 . One of the pins 14a has the same length as the hole accommodat ing it, thereby if deceitfully shifted, it will unavoidably engage the hole 8 of the respective tumbler pin 9 and produce a locked condition of the lock.
