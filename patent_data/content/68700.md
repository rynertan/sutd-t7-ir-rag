The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated one from the other by the usual methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by stereospecific or asymmetric synthesis. The compounds of formula I may be prepared in analogous manner to the compounds of formula A . The invention thus provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I , which process comprises reacting a compound of the formula XIX EMI18.1 with a compound of formula XX EMI18.2 wherein Q is a leaving group and the remaining variable groups being as defined in formula I and thereafter if necessary converting a group R11 or R12 in the thus formed compound to another group R11 or R12 respectively converting R6 to another R6 and optionally forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the resultant compound of the formula I .

It is also preferred that the activated hydrocarbyloxy group us a pentachlorophenyl ester and that the reaction is carried out at ambient temperature. The intermediates of the formulae XIX and XX are either known compounds or can be prepared hy analogous processes to known compounds. It will be realised that in the compound of the formu7 1 I the CO NR5 CH2 n linkage may have an alpha or ss orientation with respect to the ring of the bicyclic moiety to wliich it is attached. A mixture of a and p isomers of the compound of the formula I may be synthesised nonstereospecifically and the desired isomer separated conventionally therefrom, e.g. by chromatography or alternatively the a or ss isomer may if desired be synthesised from the corresponding a or ss form of the compound of the formula XX . Synthesis from the corresponding a or ss isomer of the compound of the formula XX is in general preferred. The a or ss form of the compound of the formula XX ay if desired be prepared by known stereospecific processes, such as those leading to the a and ss isomers of the compound of the formula XX depicted in the Scheme and described n Descriptions 3C, 4A and 4C of European Patent application No. 7 3302g78.6 and allowed U.S. Patent . pplication No. 07,413 for the isomers and Descriptior,s 2 and 3A and E of these Applications for the isomers. The precursor of the compound of the formula XX may be stereospecifically synthesised, such as the azide D3 of Description 2 of the above European and U.S.Applications and present Description 1, and then converted to the corresponding desired isomer of the compound of ihe formula XX under non stereospecific conditions with retention of configuration. Alternatively, the precursor may itself have no pro chiral centre at the relevant position, such as the oximes and mines ofDescriptions 3 and 4 of the above European and U.S.Applications but be converted under stereospecific conditions to the desired isomer of the compound of the formula XX . Alternatively, a mixture of the a and p isomers of t e compound of the formula XX may be synthesised nonstereospecifically and the desired isomer separated conventionally therefrom e.g. by chromatography. However, in this case it is generally more convenient to react the mixture to give a mixture of a and p isomers of the compound of the formula I and to separate these if desired as hereinbefore described The following Scheme 1 illustrates stereospecific and non stereospecific synthetic routes to intermediates of the formula XX wherein n is 0. Schema 1EMI22.1 Remainder of ring system omitted for clarity The following Scheme 2 illustrates preparative routes to inter mediates of the formula XX wherein n is 1 or 2. EMI23.1 Acids of the formula XIX may be formed from the corresponding chlorosulphonyl derivatives of the formula XXI and a suitable amine or ammonia. Scheme 1EMI24.1 Compounds of formula XXII wherein R1 is C16 alkoxy or C1 6 alkylthio are known or prepared by analogy with known compounds. When R1 and R2 together are C1 3 alkylenedioxy, formation of the ethylenedioxy bridge in acids of formula may be carried out by heating an acid of formula XXIII with dibromoethane in the presence of an inorganic base such as potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate using ethanol water as the solvent.EMI24.2 Compounds of the formula XXIII are known compounds or prepared by analogy with known cOmpounds The acid addition salts of compounds of the forriula i may be prepared in entirely conventional manner by reacting a compound of the formula I in base form with the chosen acid. The quaternary ammonium salts of the compounds of the formula I may be prepared in conventional manner for such salts, such as by reaction of the chosen compound of the formula I with a compound R 9Y as defined. This reaction is suitably carried out in an appropriate solvent such as acetone, methanol, ethanol, dimethylformamide and the like, at ambient or raised temperature and pressure. The nitrogen atom of the bicyclic moiety may also form an N oxide to give an internal N oxide salt of the compound of the formula I . The N oxides may be prepared in conventional manner such as by reaction of the chosen compound of the formula I with an organic per acid, such as m chloroperbenzoic acid. This reaction is suitably carried outat below ambient temperature in an organic solvent, preferably a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent. It will be apparent that the product of the reaction of the compounds of formulae XIX and XX will be of formula I . Compounds of the formula I containing an R11, R12 or R6 group which is convertible to another R11, R12 R6 group are also useful intermediates and as such form an important aspect of the invention. The skilled man will appreciate that the choice o necessity of conversion of groups Rill, R121, o R6 as above will be dictated by their nature and position. By way of example of such conversions, the conversion of a R11 nitro group to a R11 amino group may be achieved in conventional manner such as by reduction. Thus an optional process step provided by this invention in the preparation of the compounds of the formula I wherein Rll is an amino group comprises the reduction of a corresponding intermediate of formula I wherein R is a nitro group. The reduction of the intermediates wherein R11 is a nitro group may be effected with reagents known to be suitable for reducing nitroanisole to aminoanisole.A suitable reagent for this reduction is stannous chloride in hydrochloric acid or in mixtures of hydrochloric and acetic acid. The desired amino compound may be obtained from the reaction mixture by respectively neutralisation followed by extraction into a water immiscible solvent such as ethyl acetate from which it may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. Another suitable method is catalytic hydrogenation at atmospheric pressure in polar solvent such as ethanol. Transition metal catalysts such as Raney nickel are often used. The desired compound may be obtained from the reaction mixture by filtration and evaporation to dryness. The initial crude product in both cases may be purified by chromatography or crystallisation or by forming an acid addition salt which may be recrystallised. In general however, it is more convenient to prepare compound ofthe formula I wherein R11 is an amino group from the corresponding C17 acylamino acid or its reactive derivative, and to deacylate the compound of .,je formula I so formed. Those compounds of the invention wherein R is a C1 7 acylamino group may be prepared from the corresponding intermediate wherein R is an amino 11 group by reaction with an acylating derivative, such as previously described as a suitable acylating derivative, e.g. of the acid XIX . The reaction may proceed as described for the reaction of the compounds of the formula I . For an R11 formamido group acylation may be effected with the free acid. This invention thus also provides an optional process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I wherein R11 is an amino group which process comprises the deacylation of a corresponding intermediate wherein R11 is a C1 7 acylamino group. Generally the hydrolysis reaction may be effected by treatment with a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide. Although as noted R11 may be nitro, it is generally preferred that it is another R11 group. It will be appreciated that, when R6 in the compound of the formula I is optionally substituted benzyl as hereinbefore defined, K6 may be replaced by another group R6. Such R6 benzyl groups may be removed by conventional transition metal catalysed hydrogenolysis to give compounds of the formula XXIV EMI27.1 ereill fle variable groups are as defined in formula I . This invention also provides an optional process step in the preparation of a compound of the formula I which comprises the reaction of a corresponding compound of the formula XXIV as hereinbefore defined with a compound Q2R6wherein R6 is as defined in formula I and Q2is a group or atom readily displaced by a nucleophile, converting R12 and R11 in the resulting compound of formula I to another R12 and R11 respectively and optionally forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the resulting compound of the formula I . Suitable values for Q2include C1, Br, I, OSO2CH3 or OSO2C6H4pCH3. Favoured values for Q2include C1, Br and I. Particularly suitably the compound QRó is a benzyl halide such as benzyl bromide or benzyl chloride. The reaction may be carried out under conventional alkylation conditions for example in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide in the presence of an acid acceptor such as potassium carbonate. Generally the reaction is carried out at a non extreme temperature such as at ambient or at a slightly elevated temperature. However, it is generally more convenient to interconvert E in the compound of the formula XX before coupling zvith the compound of the formula XIX or its derivative. Such interconversions are effected conveniently under the above conditions. It is desirable to protect the amine function with a group readily rem3 able by acidolysis such as a C27 alkanoyl groups before R6 interconversion. R12 sulphamoyl may be converted to substituted sulphamoyl as hereinbefore defined by the relevant alkylation under conditions known to the skilled man as suitable for the alkylation of sulphamoyl groups. Any conversion of Rll, R12 or R6 may take place in any desired or necessary order. The compounds of the formula I are dopamine antagonists. Depending on their balance between peripheral and central action, the compounds of the formula I may be used in the treatment of disorders related to impaired gastro intestinal motility, such as retarded gastric emptying, dyspepsia, flatulence, oesophagal reflux, peptic ulcer and emesis, and or in the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system, such as psychosis. All the compounds of the formula I may be used in the treatment of emesis. The quaternary salts of the compounds of formula I are of interest for their beneficial effect on gastric motility. The invention therefore also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I , or a hydrate or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such compositions may be adapted for oral or parenteral administration, and as such may be in the form of tablets, e ipsules, oral liquid preparations, powders, granules, lozenges, reoonstitutable powders, injectable and infusable solutions or suspensions the compositions may also be i the form of suppositories. Normally, orally admini,t aWle compositions are preferred. Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation form, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, tabletting lubricants, disintegrants, and acceptable wetting agents. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented in a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, nonaqueous vehicle which may include edible oils ,. preservatives, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the compound of the formula I and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions the compound can be dissolved for injection alld filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjiivants such as a local anaesthetic, preservatives and buf tiering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilize by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound As is common practice, the compositions will usually be accompanied by written or printed directions for use in the medical treatment concerned. It will of course be realised that the precise dosage used in the treatment of any of the hereinbefore described disorders will depend on the actual compound of the formula I used, and also on other factors such as the seriousness of the disorder being treated. The invention further provides a method of treatment of maladies in mammals including humans comprising the administration of an effective amount of a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The effective amount will depend in the usual way on a number of factors such as the nature and severity of the malady. to be treated, the weight of the sufferer, and the actual compound used. However by way of illustration, unit doses will suitably contain 0.01 to 20 mgs of the compound of formula I , ior example 0.02 to 10 mgs. Again by way of illustration, such unit doses will suitably be administered more than once a day, for example 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times a day, in such a way that the total daily dose is suitably in the range 0.001 to 0 mg kg per day. Compounds of the formula 1 haveS the ability to potentiate the effect of conventional analgesics in migraine treatment when administered concurrently with the analgesic. Thus the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I and an analgesic. Tb compound of the formula I and the analgesic, suc ab aspirin or paracetamol, will be present in the composition in amounts generally similar to their usual effereive dose. The composition can be a combination product, for example tablet or capsule containing both a compound of the formula I and an analgesic for oral administration, or a twin pack comprising the two active ingredients de up for separate administration. The invention accordingly provides a method of treatment of migraine comprising the administration to the sufferer of a compound of the formula I and an analgesic. The following Examples illustrate the preparation of compounds of formula I , and the following Descriptions illustrate the preparation of intermediates therefor.

The catheter was connected to a physiological pressure transducer and pressure changes recorded on a hot wire pen recorder. In each animal a pre dose period of 40 minutes was allowed to obtain a measure of spontaneous activity. An index of activity was obtained by measuring the average height of pressure waves during 30 minute periods, Values for 4 such periods were obtained during assessment of spontaneous activity and for 40 minute period after administration of compound.Students t test was applied to the difference in average values obtained for spontaneous and post compound activity.Anti emetic activity in the dog Compounds were administered subcutaneously 30 minutes prior to administration of a standard dose of apornorphine HC1 0.1 mg kg subcutaneously and the vomiting response compared to that obtained when the same animals were dosed with apomorphine HC1 and vehicle only. Dopamine Receptor Blocking Activity in the CentralNervous System Compounds were tested for inhibition of apomorphine induced climbing in the mouse. The test is based on that described by Protais, P., Constantin, J. and Schwartz 3.C. 1976 , Psychopharmacology, 50, 1.6. Apomorphine 1 mg kg s.c. induces mice to climb the wall of a wire cage inverted food hopper 11 x 7.5 x 18 cm high . Mice acclimatised in their home cages in groups of 5 are placed under the hoppers immediately after the injection of apomorphine 1 mg kg S.C. At 10,20 and 30 minutes after injection climbing behaviour is scored. The mice are observed for 30 seconds and scored according to the position they spend the majortiy of time in, score O four paws on floor of cage score 1 four paws only on walls score 2 all paws on wall of cage. The scores at all 3 times and for each mouse are summed and mice drug treated orally compared to mice receiving apomorphine only. A saline only treated group is also included and any score, generally 5 of maximum taken into account.The results are as shown in Table 1 Toxicity No toxic effects were observed in any of the above tests.
