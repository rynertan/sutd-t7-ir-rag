# Process for preparation of filler containing polytetrafluoroethylene fine powder.

## Abstract
A process for preparation of filler containing polytetrafluoroethylene fine powder by coagulating polytetrafluoroethylene together with at least one filler selected from the group consisting of polyimide resins, polyamide imide resins, polyamide resins and carbon fiber powders from their aqueous dispersion, characterized in that a water insoluble organic liquid having a boiling point of from 30 to 150 C and a surface tension of not more than 35 dyne cm at 20 C is added to the aqueous dispersion under agitation at any stage from the start to the end of the coagulation B .
