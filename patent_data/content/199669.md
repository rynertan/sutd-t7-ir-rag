# Choke valve especially used in oil and gas wells.

## Abstract
A choke valve especially used for regulating the flow volume and with it the back pressure of liquids or gas while drilling through shallow gas bearing formations from an off shore drilling platform comprises a flexible cylindrical valve element 8 positioned in the flow passage of the valve housing 1 , the valve being designed such that the valve element s 8 flow area can be reduced by a radial reduction of the valve element. The flow area of the valve element 8 is equal to or larger than the remaining flow area of the valve. The valve has devices 10 for constricting the end of the valve element 8 being nearest to the outlet opening 3 of the valve. The valve element 8 is long enough that it is possible to compensate for the wear, to which the end is exposed, by sliding the valve element against the constrict ing devices 10 or by moving the latter along the valve element as wear proceeds. Only the valve element 8 is exposed to wear and no other parts of the valve are positioned within the wearing zone. The valve element 8 , in its withdrawn position, has its total diameter free allowing a full flow through the valve. Accordingly, the valve does not disturb the flow under normal conditions and is not exposed to any wear. At a gas kick the well can be controlled during a long period as it is possible to compensate the wear on the valve element during operation.
