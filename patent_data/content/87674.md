## Description
TITLE OF THE IlVENTION I iAGE TUBE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an improvement of an output fluorescent screen structure for an image tube, As shout in Fig. 1, conventionally, it has been a common practice that an output fluorescent structure 1 is cX 2ched to the inner face of an output glass pane 3 of an image tube main hody through a vacuum layer 2 .Therefore, there has been experienced such an inconvenience that part of 2 visible ray emitted at an output fluorescent screen 4 is subjected to a total reflection at an outer side face of a glass substrate or glass base plate 5 laminated with the output fluorescent screen 4 , with the total reflection light L1 being again directed back to the output fluorescent screen 4 , thus resulting in a deterioration in the contrast of the output image. In order to overcome the disadvantage as described above, the present applicant has previously proposed, in Japanese utility model application 188578 80, a fresh means capable of preventing the deterioration in the contrast of the output image due to the total reflection light L1 as described above, in which, the arrangement is so made that the total reflection light L1 produced at the outer side face of the glass substrate 5 is led out of an effective visual field region of the output fluorescent screen 4 by increasing the thickness of the glass substrate 5 , thereby to improve the contrast of tire output images. However, in the above proposed arrangement, for the improvement of the contrast in the output image, the thick n ss of the glass base plate 5 which has been in the order of about 1 mm or thereabout up to the present must be increased to the range of at least ten and several mm or so, and in the case where the output flluorescent screen is to be formed on the glass substrate having the thickness to such an extent, various problems as fo lows are inevitably brought ahout. More specifically, in the above arrangement, since the space occupied by the glass substrate and the weight of said glass substrate are markedly increased as compared with the conventional arrangements, there is such an inconvenience that a conventional output fluorescent screen manufacturing sister can not cope with the situation owing to the construction cf the machinery, while, even when the conventional output fluorescent screen r,anufacturing system is to be remodelled, the production efficiency will be extremely lowered, since spaces for the production required by the respective glass substrate are unavoidably increased. According, an essential object of the present invention is to provide an improved image tube which will solve the problems related to the manufacture as described above, with imultaneous elimination of deterioration in the contrast of the output imaes. adore s1 ecifically, according to the present invention, an output f uorescent screen structure for the imap,e tube is constituted by a transparent glass substrate coated with a fluorescent screen, and an output window glass pane of the image tube main body closely stuck onto the transparent glass substrate by a transparent bonding material to form a laminated structure thereby, while the thickness of the laminated structure is set to such an extent as is sufficient to cause a total reflection of light emitted at a peripheral portion of an effective visual field of said fluorescent screen and incident into the laminated structure, to reach outside a concerned or interested region within said effective visual field of said output fluorescent screen.In other words, the thickness of the output window glass pane is utilized as part of the thickness of the glass substrate required for improving the contrast of the output image, whereby it becomes possible to employ a plate with a thin thickness for the glass substrate to be coated with the output fluorescent screen, and thus, various problems related to the manufacture as described earlier may be advantageously solved. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAIGS Fig. 1 is a fragmentary side sectional view showing one example of an output fluorescent screen structure of a conventional image tube, Fig. 2 is a side sectional view showing. an output fluorescent screen strucure of an image tube according to one preferred m,bodiment of the present invention, Fig. 3 is a side sectional view showing a modified embodiment according to the present invention in the case where another transparent glass plate 7 is further bonded onto the outer side face of the output window glass pane 3 . DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE II VEiirlIOIG Subsequently, specific constructions according to the present invention will be described hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. Referring to Fig. 2, there is shown an output fluorescent screen structure of an image tube according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 2, the output fluorescent screen structure 1 is constituted by causing a glass substrate 5 coated with an output fluorescent screen 4 , to closely adhere onto the inner face of an output glass pane 3 of the image tube main body through a transparent bonding material 6 . It should be noted here that, in the above case, the thickness t of the laminated structure thus constituted is set to such an extent as is sufficient to cause a total reflection light L2 emitted at a peripheral portion S of an effective visual field of said fluorescent screen 4 and incident into the Laminated structure, to reach the outer side of a concerned or interested region S of the output fluorescent screen 4 which becomes an important portion, for example, in a medical diagnosis. Normally, in the case where examination and photographing by X rays or fluorescopy are effected in the medical field, with respect to the portion which will become the concerned region in the output image, the image at the region S1 in the range of 10 to 12 mm in di√ìu,eter at the central portion constitutes an important portion for the diagnosis, for example, when an effective visual field diameter D of the output image is 22 mm. Thus, 20 3 96 of the central area of such a photographed area is of concern to the medical field.Accordingly, for improving the contrast of the output image at said concerned region S1 , it may he so arranged that the reflected light L2 directed towards the output fluorescent screen 4 reaches the outer side beyond the concerned region in the range of 10 to 12 mm at the center of the output fluorescent screen 4 . For the above purpose, the arrangement may be so made that the thickness t of the entire laminated structure in the above case is set to be larger than approximately 9 mm based on an equation t X 2.tan d representing the relation between the thick ness t and X as shown in Fig. 2, where X represents a distance between a light emitting point PO on the output fluorescent screen 4 and a reachinno point P1 at which the visible ray in the light emitting point PO subjected to the total reflection at the outer side face of the output window glass T ane 3 again returns back to the output fluorescent screen 4 , and 0 denotes a critical angle at a boundary face 3 between the output glass pane 3 and air when the refractive indexes of the respective layers are assumed the same. Meanwhile, since the plate thickness of the output window glass pane 3 of the image tube main body is normally in the range of 4 to 5 mm, if the remaining plate thickness in the order of 4 to 5 mm is supr eented by the thickness of the transparent bonding material C and the glass substrate 5 , it is possible to lead the total reflection light L at the 2 boundary face 3 between the output window pane 3 and air, towarca the outer side of the concerned region S1 of the output fluorescent screen 4 described earlier for the improve ment 0 the contrast at said inane portion S . Referring to Fig. 3, there is shown a modification of the fore olng embodiment. In this modification, ancther transparent glass plate 7 is further arranged to closely adhere to the outer side face of the output window glass pane 3 b the transparent bonding material 6 . In this case, the thickness of the laminated structure required for the improvement of the contrast of the output image may be shared by the thickness of the transparent glass plate 7 , and therefore, the thickness of the glass substrate 5 can be reduced still further. The reflection at the outer side face of the output window also delYrades the contrast of output image. In this case, althoupp application of a non reflecting coating directly onto the outer side face of the output window glass pane 3 will become difficult owing to the large size of the image tube main body, such a purpose may be readily achieved in this case by causing the transparent glass plate 7 preliminarily applied with a non reflecting coating, to closel adhere to the outer side face of the output window glass plate 3 . In the drawings, the numeral 8 represents a metal back layer. It should be noted here that, for the transparent bonding material 6 to be employed in the foregoing embodiments, proper materials capable of maintaining durability even under a state of high vacuum and the same refractive index as the using glasses, for example, silicone rubber or the like, may be employed. As is clear from the foregoing description, according to the present invention, since the output fluorescent screen structure is constituted by the laminated structure formed by close adhesion between the glass substrate and the output window glass pane, it is possible t.o arrange the plate thick ness of the output fluorescent screen structure necessary for the improvement of the contrast in the output imaGes, to be shared by the glass base plate and the output window glass pane. Therefore, it hecornes unnecessary to employ a thick plate for the glass substrate to be coated with the output fluorescent screen, and thus, various problems in the aspect of manufacture involved in the case of production of the output fluorescent screen through employment of a thick glass substrated, can he advantageously avoided.
