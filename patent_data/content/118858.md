# Process for the decomposition and decontamination of organic substances and halogenated toxic materials.

## Abstract
A method for the decomposition of an halogenated organic compound is described which comprises reacting the compound with a reagent which consists of a at least one member which is a polyethyleneglycol, Nixolen , an alcohol or a polyhydroxy compound, b a base, and c an oxidizing agent or a source of radicals, in the absence of oxygen. The method is applicable to the decontamination of mineral oils and soil contaminated with polychlor obiphenyls, polychlorodibenzofurans, polychlorodibenzo dioxins, DDT and other halogenated organic compounds. The different possible formulations of such reagents allow the preparation of stable reactive mixture, which can be either liquid or solid the liquid reagents are particularly suitable for the decontamination of porous surfaces such as cement, gres, asphalt and for the decontamination of parts of plants contaminated by PCBs. The use of microwaves during the decontamination process proved to be particularly advantageous.
