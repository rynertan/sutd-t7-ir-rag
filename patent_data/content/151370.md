## Description
DYEING AND PRINTING FIBRES This invention relates to the dyeing, printing and optical brightening of textile fibres. It is known from US Patents 4 410 652, 4 439 203 and 4 439 208 that the fastness properties of direct, reactive and basic dyeings on textile fibres may be improved by aftertreatment with certain cationic fixing agents based upon the reaction products of amines with cyanamide, dicyandiamide, guanidine and bisguanidine. It has now been found that pretreatment with the same or similar agents improves the dyeing and brightening properties of textile fibres giving improved colour yields and the capacity to be dyed by novel dyeing routes, in addition to improved wet fastness of the resulting dyeings. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for te dyeing, printing or optical brightening of nitrogen or hydroxy group containing textile fibres, characterised by the step of pretreating the fibres, before the dyeing, printing or brightening step, with a polymeric compound comprising A a polymeric reaction product of a monofunctional or poly functional amine having one or more primary and or secondary and or tertiary amino groups with cyanamide, dicyandiamide, guanidine or bisguanidine in which up to 50 mole per cent of the cyanamide, dicyandiamide, guanidine or bisguanidine may be replaced by a dicarboxylic acid or a mono or di ester thereof, said product A containing at least one free hydrogen atom linked to a nitrogen atom or B a polymeric reaction product of A with a an N methylol derivative of a urea, melamine, guanamine, triazine, urone, urethane or acid amide, or b an epihalohydrin or a precursor thereof, or c formaldehyde or a compound which releases formaldehyde, or d an organic compound containing at least two groups capable of being split off as anions on reaction with A , or with mixtures of any two or more of a , b , c and d or C a mixture of i a polymeric reaction product of A with b or with c and ii an N methylol derivative a or mixtures of A with B and or C , all said polymeric compounds being either in free base or wholly or partly in acid addition salt form the treatment process being such that at least 0.6 wt. of the polymeric compound, based on the dry fibre weight1 becomes fixed on the fibres, provided that when the polymeric compound is the reaction product of A with a or with c , or contains free a , then it is applied together with D a catalyst for the cross linking of N methylol derivatives. The textile fibres are preferably hydroxy group containing fibres, particularly natural or regenerated cellulosic fibres, especially cotton. Useful results are also obtainable on nitrogencontaining fibres such as polyacrylonitrile and natural or synthetic polyamides, preferably wool, silk or nylon. Acid modified polyester and polyamide, which contain acidic hydroxy groups, may also be used. The fibres may be in the form of loose fibres or yarns or fabrics, or in any suitable form. Fabrics are a convenient and preferred form. The fibres may be blended with other fibres which are susceptible of treatment by the process of the invention or with fibres which are not so susceptible. For example1 cotton and regenerated cellulose fibres may be blended together or individually with polyester fibres, the latter being dyed with disperse dyes. Fibre blends and yarn blends may be used. The process may also be used in the dyeing of leather. The pretreated fibres may be dyed or printed with anionic dyestuffs, including direct dyes, acid dyes and reactive dyes, or with basic dyestuffs. Preferred dyes are direct dyes, preferably those having at least two sulphonic acid or sulphonamide groups in the dye molecule, more preferably 3 8 such groups, particularly 4 6. Particularly preferred are highly substantive direct dyes which show a high degree of exhaust on cotton when dyed by the conventional exhaust process. Preferably the direct dyes have a molecular weight above 1000, more preferably above 1200. Preferably the direct dyes are in the form of 1 1 or 1 2 metal complexes, particularly copper complexes. Particularly suitable direct dyes are those meeting the criteria set out in US Patent 4 410 652, the dyes whose formulae are listed in that US patent, and those listed in US Patent 4 439 203 under their Colour Index numbers. A further group of particularly suitable dyes have the properties both of direct dyes and of reactive dyes. They are highly substantive as described above, and also contain in their molecule one or more halogens attached to aromatic heterocyclic rings, which can be split off as an anion under alkali fixation conditions. Preferred dyestuffs of this type contain one or two mono or di halo particularly chloro substituted triazinyl groups. Examples of dyestuffs with one such group correspond to formula I EMI4.1 in which each R3a independently is hydrogen C14 alkyl or C1 4 alkyl substituted by one OH, CN or phenyl group Rla is Cl or F, particularly Cl and E are identical or different chromophoric groups. Examples of dyestuffs with two triazinyl groups are those of formula IIEMI4.2 in which R R3a and E are as defined above, and B is a direct bond or a divalent aliphatic, aromatic, cycloaliphatic or heterocyclic bridging group, or forms a heterocyclic bridging group together with the twoEMI4.3 groups to which it is joined. In the compounds of formulae I and II, the chromophoric group E can be identical or different residues of mono or polyazo dyes, or of anthraquinone, stilbene, hydrazone, methine or azomethine dyes, in which the mono or polyazo dye residues may be in the form of 1 1 or 1 2 metal complexes, such as 1 1 copper, chromium, cobalt, nickel or manganese or 1 2 chromium, cobalt or iron complexes.The bridging group B is preferably of formulaEMI5.1 EMI5.2 in which X can be bound in the 4,4 , 3,4 or 3,3 positions and represents a direct bond or a bridging group such as is conventional in the chemistry of direct dyestuffs, or may form a piperazine ring together with the twoEMI5.3 groups to which it is bound. Suitable triazinyl group containing dyestuffs are disclosed in British published Patent Applications 2,106,126 A, 2,111,538 A and 2,122,634 A. Suitable dyestuffs for use in dyeing polyamide pretreated according to the invention are known under the description of C.I.Acid Dyes. The pretreated textile fibres may be dyed or printed with reactive dyes, particularly those containing a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic ring having aromatic character and containing 2 or 3 nitrogen atoms, which is substituted by 1 3 halogen atoms which can be split off as anions during fixation. The reactive group can also be a vinylsulphonyl , vinylcarbonyl , sulphato or sulphate ester group. Such dyes are known under the designation CI. Reactive Dyes. Suitable reactive dyes include C.I. Reactive Reds 2, 6,8, 120, 123 and 171 C.I. Reactive Blues 94, 104, 114, 116, 163, 168, 172 and 193 C.I. Reactive Yellows 7, 84 and 111 C.I.Reactive Oranges 4, 14 and 69 C.I. Reactive Browns 10 and 23 C.I. Reactive Black 8 and C.I. Reactive Violet 33. Basic dyestuffs suitable for use in conjunction with the pretreatment step according to the invention are generally those designated as C.I. Basic Dyes. They contain protonatable primary, secondary or tertiary amino groups and or quaternary ammonium groups, and may also contain sulphonic acid groups, provided that the number of basic groups is higher than the number of acid groups in the molecule. Basic dyes may also be in the form of 1 1 or 1 2 metal complexes. Suitable basic dyes are described for example in US Patent 4 439 208. In addition to the above mentioned anionic and basic dyes, it is also possible to dye or print the treated textile fibres with phthalocyanine, sulphur, vat, formazan, di or tri phenylmethane or indigo dyestuffs. Optical brighteners may also be used, preferably anionic optical brighteners which are substantive to cotton. After the substrate has been pretreated according to the invention it may also be possible to use cationic brighteners. The polymeric compound A is preferably the reaction product of an amine of formula III R NH R III or, preferably, a polyalkylene polyamine of formula IV RRN Z X Z WRR IV in which each R independently is hydrogen or a C110alkyl group unsubstituted or monosubstituted with hydroxy, C14alkoxy or cyano, n is a number from 0 to 100 Z, or each Z independently when n 0, is C24 alkylene or hydroxyalkylene and X, or each X independently when n 1, is 0 , S or NR where R is as defined above, provided that the amine of formula IV contains at least one reactive NH or NH2 group, with cyanamide, dicyandiamide DCDA , guanidine or bisguanidine. More preferably each R in IV is hydrogen,n is 0 to 4,X is NH or NCH3 and Z, or each Z independently when n 0, is C2 4 alkylene. Particularly preferred compounds are diethylene triamine, triethylene tetramine, tetraethylene pentamine, 2 aminoethyl 3 aminopropylamine, dipropylene triamine and N,N bis 3 aminopropyl methylamine. Components A are known, and may be prepared by the methods described for example in British Patent No. 657 753, US Patent No.2 649 354 and US Patent 4 410 652. Suitably the amine, in free base or salt form, is reacted with the other starting material in the absence of water at elevated temperatures optionally in the presence of a non aqueous solvent. Preferably the reaction is carried out in the absence of solvent at a temperature of 140 160 C, and for most combinations of reagents, ammonia is evolved. The reagents are preferably reacted in a molar ratio of 0.1 to 1 mole of cyanamide, DCDA, guanidine or biguanidine per mole of reactive NH or NH2 groups, and when DCDA is reacted with a polyalkylene polyamine, the molar ratio of the reactants is more preferably from 2 1 to 1 2, particularly about 1 1. The products A are near colourless viscous liquids or solids which are basic in character, water soluble either in the free base or salt form, and contain reactive hydrogen atoms bonded to nitrogen. Up to 50 mole, preferably up to 20 mole of the DCDA or other reagent to be reacted with the amine may be replaced by a dicarboxylic acid or a mono or di ester thereof. Suitable acids include adipic acid, oxalic acid and terephthalic acid, for example in the form of their dimethyl esters. Particularly preferred compounds A are the reaction products of DCDA with diethylenetriamine or triethylenetetramine. Reaction products precondensates of A with compound a , i.e. an N methylol derivative of a urea, melamine, guanamine, triazine, urone, urethane or acid amide are described in US Patent 4 410 652, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Preferred N methylol compounds are hydrolysisresistant reactive resin precursors, for example N,N dimethylol 4,5 dihydroxyethyleneurea or 4,5 dimethoxyethyleneurea, N,N dimethylol 4 methoxy 5,5 dimethylpropyleneurea and N,N dimethylol carbamates, optionally in etherified form. Preferred ether forms are the methyl and ethyl ether derivatives. Reaction products of A with b an epihalohydrin or a precursor thereof are disclosed in US Patent 4 439 203, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The reaction product of A with an epihalohydrin may also be obtained in the form of a stable aqueous dispersion by acidifying the reaction product obtained as described in US Patent 4 439 203, optionally in the presence of a water soluble polymer, to a pH of 2 5, preferably 4 4.5. Reaction products of A with c formaldehyde or a formaldehyde precursor e.g. paraformaldehyde optionally together with a are also described in US Patent 4 439 203. The reaction is preferably carried out in an aqueous medium at a temperature from 200 60 C, preferably 40 50 C and at a pH 4, preferably betweeen 7 and 11. The formaldehyde may be added in the form of a concentrated e.g. 37 aqueous solution. Preferred mole ratios of compound A to formaldehyde are in the range 1 2 1 6, based on the number of moles of amine originally present. Reaction products of A with d an organic compound containing at least two groups capable of being split off as anions on reaction with A are novel and form part of the present invention. Preferred compounds d are of formula V Y R1 Y V in which each Y independently is a halogen atom and R1 is a group of formulaEMI9.1 or gamma a C2 12 alkylene group which may be substituted by one OH or C1 4 alkoxy aroup and which may be interrupted by one NH , NR4 or XR4R4 group, and or by 0 , and or by S . in which R2 is halogen or a group OR5 or NR6R5 each R3 independently is a straight or branched chain C1 8 alkylene group each R4 independently is C18 alkyl, preferably C14 alkyl, which may be substituted by one OH, CN or NR6R5 group each R5 independently is hydrogen or a C1 4 alkyl group which may be substituted by one halogen, OH, CN, NR6R6 or NR7R7R8 A group, each R6 independently is hydrogen or Cl 4 alkyl, each R7 independently is C1 4 alkyl R8 is C1 4 alkyl, phenyl C1 4 alkyl, CH20CH3 or C2H4CONH2, A is a non chromophoric organic or inorganic anion, and non quaternary amine groups may be protonated.

Preferred compounds d are of formula VI Y1 R1 Y1 VI in which each Y1 independently is chlorine or bromine and R 1 is a group a in which R2 is R2 where R is Cl, OH, OCH3, NH CH2 2 3 N, NH CH2 2 3 N CH3 2 or NH CH2 2 3 CH3 3 A or a group ss in which R2 is R2 and R3 is R3 where each R3 is independently C1 4 alkylene or a group CH2 R9 CR2 Y2 C 2 10 , 10 R10 CH2 R R4 or gamma 3 CH2 R10 N R10 CH2 R4 in which each R4 independently is C14alkyl, R9 is a direct bond, CHOH or a C2 10 alkylene group which may be interrupted by up to 3 0 atoms each R10 independently is a C1 5 alkylene group which may be interrupted by up to 3 0 atoms and Rjj is hydrogen or Cl 4 alkyl. Particularly preferred compounds d are of formula VII, VIII or IX HN CH2CH2Cl 2 VII BrCH2CH2Br VIIIEMI11.1 in which both Y2 s are identical and are Cl or Br R2 is C1 or NH C3H6 N CH3 3 N CH3 3 A where S is Cl0 or CH3SO4 Compound VII is preferably in acid addition salt form e.g. H2N CH2CH2Cl 2 C10. The reaction with polymeric compound A is preferably carried out in water or an organic solvent at a temperature of from 5 to 1300C, preferably 15 700C, and under neutral to mildly alkaline conditions. Suitably from 0.1 to 3 molar equivalents i.e. from 0.05 to 1.5 moles of compound d for each equivalent of the polymeric compound A , based on the number of functional groups in the original amine. More preferably from 0.2 to 0.5 molar equivalents of d are used for each equivalent of A . The compounds of formula d are known or can be prepared in conventional manner from available starting materials. The reaction products of d with A are water soluble or water dispersible polymeric compounds with basic or cationic properties. They may be used as pretreatment agents according to the present invention, and also as aftertreatment agents for the fixation of the same dyestuffs upon the same textile fibre substrates. In the case of dyeings with basic dyestuffs, it is also possible to apply the reaction product of d with A simultaneously with the dyestuff from the same dyebath, optionally in the presence of additional dyeing auxiliaries. As aftertreatment agents the reaction products of d with A may be applied by continuous processes, e.g. padding, or by exhaust, preferably by exhaust. The quantity to be applied will depend upon the depth of the dyeing and on the substrate, but generally from 0.5 10 , preferably 1 4 by weight based on the dry weight of substrate can be used. The aftertreatment may also involve simultaneous or sequential application of a reaction product of A with an Nmethylol compound a , e.g. the product of Example 1 of US Patent 4 410 652. Polymeric products C which are mixtures of i the reaction product of A with b or with c and ii an N methylol compound a are described in US Patent 4 439 203. The N methylol compound a may be added to the reaction product of A with b or with c together with catalyst D , or a may be added to the mixture of A with b or with c before reaction takes place.In this case it is preferred that catalyst D is also present in the reaction mixture. Suitable catalysts D are listed in US Patent 4 439 203.Preferred catalysts are the nitrates, sulphates, chlorides and hydrogen orthophosphates of aluminium, magnesium or zinc, more preferably of magnesium, particularly magnesium chloride, optionally together with an alkali metal sulphate, particularly sodium sulphate. Such catalysts are required in the pretreatment process of the invention whenever N methylol groups are present, whether due to the presence of component a or formed by the reaction of A with c formaldehyde. When N methylol groups are present and a catalyst is used, the preferred application method is by a continuous process for example padding, dipping, spraying or foam application, most preferably by padding at room temperature. When no N methylol groups are present, that is, when the pretreatment agent is A alone or the reaction product of A with b or with d with no addition of a , continuous application processes may also be used but the preferred method is by exhaust application. The polymeric compound is applied to the fibres in a concentration which allows at least 0.6 w wf of the compound to become fixed onto the fibres. The nature of the fixation is not fully understood, possibly involving chemical bonding to available fibre groups such as hydroxyl groups on cellulose, but fixed compound is not removed by repeated washing. If the fibres are blended with fibres which do not take up the compound or take it up only minimally, then either these fibres are excluded from the fibre weight in calculating the concentration of compound, or an adjustment is made to account for any compound they take up. Preferably 0.6 to 2 w wf of compound becomes fixed to the fibres in the pretreatment. This range covers the values at which most fibres which take up the compound in significant amounts reach or approach saturation of fixed compound. For example, most cottons give saturation values of 0.6 to 0.9 w wf, standard viscose rayons give higher values of 0.7 to 1.0 w wf, and highly absorptive viscous rayons such as Viloft Registered Trademark of Courtaulds PLC give even higher values of 1.0 to 1.3 w wf. More preferably from 0.7 to 1.3 w wf remains fixed. If even dyeing is to be achieved, then compound applied in the pretreatment needs to be taken up evenly and this requires a sufficient concentration of compound to be used. In exhaustion processes, too low a concentration of compound leads to premature exhaustion of the bath and hence uneven take up. In continuous processes such as padding too low a concentration of compound can lead to a reduction of that concentration during processing this is known as tailing. This and other factors lead to uneven application. Even take up is promoted if the concentration of the compound applied is sufficiently high to allow the take up of fixed compound to reach or approach the saturation value for the fibres concerned. In commercial practice it is better to provide a safety margin by applying the compound at a higher concentration than the saturation value and subsequently washing off unfixed compound.Solution concentrations usually will be higher than the concentration which it is intended to apply to the fibres to take account of the fact that percentage exhaustion or percentage expression is usually less than 100 . Percentage exhaustions and percentage expressions of 70 to 80 arecommon. On the other hand, solution concentrations usually may be reduced by an appropriate amount if the fibres to be pretreated are blended with fibres which are unaffected or minimally affected by the pretreatment.Where 100 X of the fibres accept the pretreatment, suitable solution concentrations will usually be in the range 1.0 to 5 w wf. Swiss Patent No. 386,983 discloses a process for dyeing cellulose fabrics pretreated with compound A in which the application is by padding using a solution concentration of 2 or 3 g litre at an expression of 80 X Examples . This produces a take up of 0.16 to 0.24 w wf, of which a significant percentage will be unfixed. At these low concentration levels, the process cannot be operated satisfactorily under commercial conditions because of tailing and uneven take up of compound.Moreover, the residual unfixed compound, which is not removed by rinsing, would not be wet fast. The process never, in fact, became commercial. The pretreatment compound may be applied at a pH within a wide range, pH3.5to 13 preferably pH 5 11. In an exhaust process of application, which may be from a long or short bath, optimum exhaustion is favoured by starting off with a weakly acidic bath and then after heating the bath up from room temperature to a temperature of 500C to 1000C, making the bath alkaline for example pH 9 to 11 by the addition of sodium carbonate to control the exhaustion and fixation. The concentration of sodium carbonate preferably Is in the range 0.5 to 5 w wf, most preferably at about half the concentration of the pretreatment agent.Excessive alkalinity causes deactivation of the groups available for dyeing, probably as a result of cross linking of the compound, and for that reason it is preferred to avoid the use of caustic alkali, or concentrations of sodium carbonate of greater than 6 w wf. Padding may be carried out over the range of pH specified. If, as is preferred, excess pretreatment compound is applied to the fibres, then the fibres are subsequently washed to remove unfixed compound. Dyeing by the exhaust method may be carried out on the wet pretreated fabric, but for pad dyeing or printing, an intermediate drying usually is required. Drying temperatures of 700 to 1200C are suitable. but when the pretreatment compound contains N methylol groups, care needs to be taken that cross linking does not become too extensive during drying since this may hinder uptake of dye. When N methylol groups are present, it is preferred to carry out a final heatcuring step after the pretreatment and dyeing, printing or brightening steps.The substrate may for example be dried at 70 1200C and finally cross linked at a temperature of 130 180 C for 2 to 8 minutes, or alternatively simultaneously dried and cross linked by heat treatment at 100 2000C, preferably 140 180 C for 5 seconds to 8 minutes depending on the temperature. A preferred process involves heating the substrate to 170 1800C for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Dyeing of the pretreated fibres may be carried out over a broad range of pH 3.5 to under conditions which vary from these conventionally used with a particular type of dye to conditions which it is only possible to use satisfactorily on the pretreated fibres. For example the usual alkaline fixation of reactive dyes may be used and this gives substantial improvements in colour yield, 30 X and greater, with normal or improved wet fastness and light fastness which are either unchanged or marginally reduced. Dyeing times and dye usages may also be reduced. On the other hand, new dyeing routes with important commercial implications are made possible by the pretreatment.Thus, most reactive dyes may be applied under acidic or neutral conditions, generally in the range pH 4.0 to 7.0. This also applies to direct dyes stable under acid conditions, acid dyes, and pre metallised acid dyes. Under acid conditions, very efficient exhaustion and excellent fixation may be achieved, especially if the dye applied on weight of fabric is controlled in strict ratio to the pretreatment compound applied. There is also reduced dye hydrolysis and, coupled with the efficient dye uptake, this results in minimal clearing being required. In addition there are considerable savings in dye costs and chemical costs, Darticularly for alkali, which may be eliminated in many cases, but also for water and electrolyte. Other cost savings derive from reduced dyeing times, lower energy requirements and a reduction in effluent. An important effect of being able to dye with reactive dyes under acidic conditions is on the dyeing of polyester cellulosic blends with mixtures of reactive and disperse dyes. Current commercial processes dye the components sequentially in a two bath process, with the full cycle lasting about 8.5 hours in the most efficient systems and commonly 12 hours or more. With cellulosic fibres pretreated according to the process of the invention, dyeing of both components may proceed simul taneously in a single bath over about 3.5 hours. This drastic reduction in dyeing time, energy and usage of chemicals and equipment has a major impact on the cost of dyeing polyester cellulosic blends. In addition to exhaustion processes the pad batch system may be used with reactive dyes. Under alkaline conditions, colour yields are greatly improved giving large savings in dye costs. Under acid conditions, equivalent colour yields are obtainable, with the complete elimination of alkali from the dyebath and better control of the dyeing process. In addition, excellent fixation may be achieved over much reduced batching times, with a reduction in the duration and severity of the subsequent washing stage. Chrome dyes are used mainly for dyeing wool and are not suitable for dyeing untreated cellulosic fibres. However, they are capable of giving deep dyeings on cellulosic fibres pretreated according to the process of the invention with good wet fastness and light fastness. Cellulosic fabrics which have been pretreated according to the process of the invention may be printed using reactive dyes and give good print fixation on normal drying without the need for steam fixation. Colour yields are also improved, reducing the need for pre mercerising. The polymeric compound itself may be printed onto the fabric so that subsequent dyeing of the fabric produces differential colour patterning. Rapid fixation on drying also allows continuous processing using a pad dye fix wash off sequence. This includes pad thermosol processes on polyester cellulosic blends and also on 100 cellulosics. Tone in tone and differential dyeing effects may be obtained by using cellulosic fibres which have been pretreated according to the process of the invention in combination with untreated cellulosic fibres. For example, 100 X cotton fabrics may be knitted or woven in a pattern such as stripes defined by treated and untreated yarns, to give ecru fabric which may be dyed on demand in various colourways. High, medium and low contrast tone in tone effects may be achieved using reactive dyes applied under alkaline conditions or mildly acidic conditions.Dye selection can be used to produce differential dyeing. A further advantage using direct cr reactive dyes is the covering of dead cotton immature fibres which tend to clump together and are dyed less easily , enabling the usual white specks on the dyed fabric to be eliminated. The same applies to miniblends comprising cotton with small quantities of synthetic fibres such as polyester. The pretreated and dyed fabric may also be aftertreated with an aftertreatment agent comprising a reaction product of A with a or with c together with a catalyst, which further increases the wet fastness properties of the dyeing and at the same time imparts a crease resistant finish to the goods. The following Examples, in which all parts and percentages are by weight and in the case of pretreatment bath or dyebath compositions are based upon the dry weight of substrate,and temperatures are in degrees Centigrade, illustrate the invention. Example 1 Preparation of Compound A Diethylenetriamine 103 parts is mixed with dicyandiamide 84 parts and the mixture is heated to a temperature of 1100 whilst being stirred continuously. At 1100, the reaction becomes exothermic and ammonia is given off. The mixture is then heated slowly over a period of 6 hours to a temperature of 1600 until ammonia ceases to be liberated. The total amount of ammonia given off is approximately 34 parts The reaction product is poured out of the reaction vessel whilst fluid and is allowed to solidify to a powder. 69.3 Parts of the powder are added slowly to 81 parts of water at a temperature of 350C whilst stirring, and then 53.4 parts of 44.6 per cent wt sulphuric acid are added together with 45 parts of ice so that the temperature does not rise above 48 to 50 . The sulphate addition salt is formed as an aqueous solution, and is converted into a solid powder by spray drying. This product is referred to as compound Al.Examples 2 to 12 Pretreatment with compound AExample 2 a A 100 per cent cotton knitted towelling fabric is immersed in an aqueous bath comprising Compound Al 2 Acetic acid 0.25 ml litre The bath is initially at room temperature and at a pH of 5.5, the liquor to goods ratio being 10 1. The bath is heated up to a temperature of 70 at a rate of 40 min and then 1.0 per cent sodium carbonate is added to the bath over 10 minutes.Treatment at 700 is continued for 10 minutes, after which the bath is drained and the treated fabric rinsed successively with warm then cold water. The amount of compound A fixed on the fabric was found to be 0.74 See test method b the treated fabric is then dyed at a liquor to goods ratio of 10 1 in an aqueous dyebath set at a temperature of 50 and comprising C.I. Reactive Yellow 84 0.25 C.I. Reactive Red 120 1.0 X C.I.Reactive Blue 172 3.2 X Matexil PAL 1.0 g l an anti reducing agent After 10 minutes, the temperature of the dyebath is raised to 850 at a rate of 20 min and dyeing is continued at that temperature for 15 minutes. 80 g l of sodium chloride is then added to the dyebath over 30 minutes, and after a further 45 minutes, 20 g l of sodium carbonate is added over 20 minutes. Dyeing is continued for a further 60 minutes, and the dyed fabric rinsed in warm then cold water. This rinse sequence is repeated after washing off the fabric in an aqueous soap bath containing 2 g l soap flakes at the boil for 20 minutes. Finally, the fabric is dried. A navy blue dyeing exhibiting no dead cotton specks is obtained, whereas a control dyeing without pretreatment exhibits white specks. In comparison with the control, the dyeing of the example has improved colour yield, wet fastness and stability, while light fastness is not reduced.Example 3 a A knitted interlock fabric comprising 50 per cent cotton yarn and 50 per cent polyester polyethylene terephthalate yarn is given a pre treatment with compound Al according to the procedure of Example 2 but using 3 per cent compound Al and 1.5 per cent sodium carbonate. b The treated fabric is immersed at a 10 1 liquor to goods ratio in an aqueous dyebath at room temperature comprising C.I.

An even dyeing in a full shade of claret is obtained. The overall dyeing time is about 3.5 hours, which compares with a time of at least 8.5 hours for the normal commercial sequence for dyeing polyester cotton blends using a two bath process.Example 4 a A 100 per cent cotton knitted interlock fabric is given a pre treatment with compound Al as in Example 1. b The treated fabric is dyed with a direct dye from an aqueous dyebath set at a temperature of 500 and comprising C.I.

The dyebath is heated up to a temperature of 1000 at a rate of 1.5 min and then 10 g l of sodium chloride is added, with dyeing continuing for a further 45 minutes. After cooling the dyebath the fabric is rinsed in cold water and then dried. A blue dyeing with improved colour yield compared to a control fabric dyed in the same manner but without pretreatment,Is obtained. Example 5 a A 100 per cent cotton knitted interlock fabric is given a pre treatment with compound Al as in Example 3. b The treated fabric is dyed at a liquor to goods ratio of 10 1 with a pre metallised acid dye in an aqueous dyebath set at a temperature of 50 and comprising C.I.

Mordant Black 13 5.0 Acetic acid 1.0 Sodium sulphate 10.0 The dyebath is heated to a temperature of 1000 at a rate of 20 min and then, after a further 30 minutes, 2 per cent formic acid is added. Dyeing is continued for 15 minutes and then the dyebath is cooled to a temperature of 800 and 1.5 per cent potassium dichromate is added. The temperature of the bath is raised to 1000 again and dyeing is continued for 30 minutes before the dyebath is finally cooled and drained. The dyed fabric is given successive rinses in warm and then cold water, and then dried. The fabric is evenly dyed to a full shade of black.Example 7 a A 100 per cent cotton knitted towelling fabric is pretreated with compound Al as in Example 2. b After drying, the fabric is dyed according to the pad batch system using reactive dyes.

After being left in this batched state for 1 hour, the fabric is rinsed, soaped at the boil, and then rinsed again as described in Example 2. The fabric is then dried. Compared with a control fabric for which the pretreatment with compound Al is omitted and a dwell time of 4 hours is necessary, the dyed fabric has a substantially improved colour yield.Example 8 b Two further quantities of the pre treated fabric ofExample 7 a are dyed by the pad batch system as described inExample 7 b using the following pad baths 1 C.I.

The impregnated fabric is dried at a temperature of 1100 and then given a thermosol heat treatment for 30 seconds at a temperature of 180 . Subsequently the fabric is rinsed, soaped off at the boil, rinsed and dried. The fabric is dyed to a uniform, well penetrated medium navy blue shade exhibiting good light and very good wet fastness properties. A control fabric, which has not been pretreated with compound Al is otherwise processed in an identical manner. The resulting fabric is dyed only to a pale, non uniform shade, approximately one third of the depth of the pre treated material. c A further sample of pretreated fabric is dyed by the process described but with the dyebath also incorporating 100 g l of urea. The resulting fabric is 50 deeper in shade than the shade achieved in the absence of urea and the dyeing has good Tight and very good wet fastness properties. The pad thermosol route described is also suitable for polyester cellulosi c blends. Test Method To determine the amount of polymeric compound fixed to the fibre, the treated substrate is rinsed with cold water for 5 min.with agitation, then rinsed with warm 60 C water for 5 min., then dried. The nitrogen content of the dried treated fibre is determined by semimicro Kjedahl analysis, and from this is subtracted the nitrogen content of the untreated fibre. The nitrogen content of the cationic polymeric compound is also known, and from this the wt. of compound fixed on the fibre may be calculated. Thus, if the nitrogen content of the treated fibre is X1 and of the untreated fibre is XO and of the pure polymeric compound isY , then the wt. of compound fixed is given by X . 100 Y
