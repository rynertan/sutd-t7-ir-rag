# EGG COUNTING DEVICE

## Abstract
In a device for counting a batch of eggs, the eggs 25 are fed sequentially one behind the other through a counting sta tion 13 . A light beam 22 is angled so that a discrete pulse 24 is produced from a light activated switch LAS1 each time the beam is intercepted by an egg. Since only the upper sector of each egg intercepts the beam, a pulse is produced for each egg whether the eggs are contacting one another or spaced apart and regardless of their orientation.
