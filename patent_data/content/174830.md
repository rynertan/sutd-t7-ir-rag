# A wire compensator for a wire driving window regulator.

## Abstract
A wire compensator which is used in a window regulator for raising and lowering a window glass of a motor car door by driving wires connected to the window glass said wire compensator can absorb elongation occurred in the wires due to tensions repeatedly applied to the wires by means of a pair of levers being rotatable by a spring, so that the wires can be kept stretched at a predetermined tensile strength.
