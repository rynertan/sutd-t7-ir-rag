# CONTROL CIRCUIT FOR TRACTION VEHICLE PROPULSION SYSTEM

## Abstract
Control circuit for a traction vehicle propulsion system which system comprises a d c motor 2 and an excitation generator 3 for separately exciting the motor field 2b . Current in the field winding 3b of the excitation generator is normally controlled by the control circuit 15 which is arranged to prevent vehicle misdirection due to control circuit failure modes wherein normal excitation current is not supplied. The control circuit comprises means 50,50b,50c responsive to an acceleration command signal for temporari ly removing the field winding from the normally operational control circuit configuration 41, 44 and for placing it instead in a biasing circuit comprising low impedance paths 52,54c 51,60 to the respective terminals B ,G of a direct voltage source, thereby presetting the magnetic field of the field winding in the proper direction to prevent vehicle misdirection upon acceleration from rest.
