# Fluid catalyst regeneration process and apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for the oxidative removal of coke from a coke contaminated solid fluidizable catalyst such as a fluid catalytic cracking catalyst comprises a high temperature coke combustion zone 1 , a catalyst disengagement zone 2 and an external heat removal zone 3 . A mixture of coke contaminated catalyst, oxygen containing regeneration gas and hot regenerated catalyst and cool regenerated catalyst from the heat removal zone 3 are contacted in the high temperature combustion zone 1 , the temperature of which may be controlled by adjusting the rate at which catalyst is recycled from the heat removal zone 3 . The temperature of the catalyst gas mixture may be controlled by adjusting the rate at which hot catalyst is recycled from the disengage ment zone 2 .
