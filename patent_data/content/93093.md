# Preparation of a hydrophilic coating.

## Abstract
A process for coating a polymer surface with a hydrophi lic coating with low friction in wet condition. The process comprises applying to the polymer surface a solution containing between 0.05 to 40 of a compound which comprises at least two unreacted isocyanate groups per molecule, evaporating the solvent, applying a solution containing between 0.5 to 50 of polyvinylpyrrolidone to the thus created polymer surface and then evaporating the solvent of the last mentioned solution, and curing the coating at elevated temperature. The process is preferably carried out in the presence of a catalyst for the curing of isocyanate.
