# Method and apparatus for texturizing thermoplastic yarn.

## Abstract
Thermoplastic yarn is texturized by the known method of forwarding it in a heated condition to a crimping zone at the entrance of a stuffer chamber 7 so as to form a plug 8 of crimped yarn within the chamber and withdrawing the yarn from the other end of the plug at a speed which is related to the input speed. The improvement comprises deriving signals from the speed of the yarn plug 8 in the stuffer chamber 7 by means of a sensing wheel 11 which drives a gapped monitoring disc 13. The disc 13 operates to intercept a beam of light from a source 14 which is directed on to a photosensor 15. The output of the photo sensor is supplied to an electrical controller 36 which measures the time during which light is received for each gap in the disc 13 to provide a measure of the speed of the yarn plug. The resultant signals are used to control the temperature of the yarn passing to the crimping zone in such a way as to maintain the speed and hence the quality of the bulk yarn substantially constant. For this purpose the signals from the controller 36 are fed to a heater controller 28 to adjust the current to a heating element 5 in a chamber 4 through which steam passes before feeding the yarn 1 through a jet passage 2 leading to the chamber 7.
