# A wire cut electric discharge machining method and control device.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a method of electric discharge machining by means of a wire electrode for cutting a workpiece into a commanded shape by producing an electric discharge between the workpiece and the wire electrode and moving the wire electrode relative to the workpiece along a commanded path. The method includes steps of previously storing, in a computer memory, sets of machining conditions which differ depending upon work piece material and thickness, reading out of the memory a predetermined set of the machining conditions in response to a machining condition selection instruction issued in a machining program at the time that the workpiece is being machined, and performing electric discharge machining in accordance with the read set of machining conditions. The invention also provides a control device operable to produce method. The machining is carried out on an electric discharge machine 107 and the control device comprises a processor 103 and a memory 106 in which the sets of machining conditions are stored. Machining is controlled by the processor 103 in dependence upon a paper tape 101 fed into a tape reader 102 .
