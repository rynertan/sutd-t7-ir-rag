# A semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory has a number of memory cells located at the crossing points of a plurality of bit lines 8 and a plurality of word lines 2 . Each of the memory cells consists of an information storing element such as a didode 3,4 or a fuse 11 and a PNP transistor connected in series. An N type epitaxial layer 2 is used as the word line and a P type semiconductor substrate 1 of the memory is used as a common collector output line for all the cells.
