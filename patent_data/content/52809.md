# Apparatus for measuring tire uniformity.

## Abstract
The automotive tire T being measured is loaded in advance by the load applying means 24 , and the drum 21 is driven to rotate the tire. A displacement of the rotatable shaft 22 produced in response to a variation in the radial force acting between the tire and the drum is detected as a displacement of the movable member 23 which is in turn indicated as the radial force variation generated on the tire. Thus, the apparatus can measure a radial force variation with precision under a condition approximating an actual running condition of automobiles.
