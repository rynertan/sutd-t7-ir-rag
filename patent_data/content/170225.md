# Radio receiver.

## Abstract
Comprising a detector 2 , an equalizer 3 , a discrimina tor 4 , a carrier recovery circuit 6 , a clock regenerator circuit 7 , an abnormal receiving condition detector 9 and a variable phase shifter 10 , a radio receiver gradually changes the phase of the regenerated clock by means of the phase changer 10 when an abnormal receiving condition is detected. Since clock phase changes gradually, the equalizer 3 which reduces receiving distortion and the discriminator 4 are periodically synchronized. As a result, if receiving distortion is reduced at this time, the operation of the equalizer 3 and discriminator 4 are normalized and the normal receiving condition can be recovered quickly.
