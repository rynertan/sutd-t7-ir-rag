## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention relates to the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids to the corresponding alcohols and esters, and more particularly, to a low temperature, low pressure, vapor phase hydrogenation of mono and di functional carboxylic acids to the corresponding alcohol and or ester, in the presence of a copper oxide supported catalyst. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Carboxylic acids are a well known class of organic compounds possessing a wide variety of both bulk industrial and diverse specialty usages. The hydrogenation of carboxylic acids ad their derivatives to alcohols and or esters has been attempted in the art, usually in liquid phase reactions. U.S. patent 2,093,159 discloses the catalytic hydrogenation of esters of carboxylic acids over catalytic substances such as copper, nickel, silver, zinc, cadmium, lead or cobalt and activating substances including certain transition metals, alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals. U.S. patent 4,398,C39 discloses a process for the vapor phase hydrogenation of carboxylic acids to the corresponding alcohols, in the presence of steam and a catalyst comprising the mixed oxides of ruthenium, at least one of cobalt or nickel, and, optionally, one of cadmium, zinc, copper, iron and several other metals. This process, however, produces high conversions only at higher tempera tures and pressures than are considered desirable. U.K. patent application 2,116,552 discloses a process for the hydrogenolysis of a carboxylic acid ester, comprising contacting the ester and hydrogen witch a catalyst formed from a reduced raixture of copper oxide and zinc oxide, at a temperature from about 75 3000C and at pressures ransqr,a from about 0.1 100 Kg cm2 absolute. It is an object of this invention to provide a process for the preparation of selected alcohols and or esters in high yields and high conversions from the corresponding carboxylic acid through the catalytic hydrogenation reaction of the selected acid. It is another object of this invention to provide a process in which selected carboxylic acids are hydrogenated to the corresponding alcohols and or esters in a vapor phase reaction occurring under moderate temperatures and super atmospheric pressures in which the hydrogenation catalyst activity and resulting product yield are substantial. It is still another object of the invention to provide a catalyst which is easily replaceable, economically feasible and as active as those of the prior art. It is yet another object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of ethanol and or ethyl acetate from acetic acid in the vapor phase under moderate conditions of temperature and pressure in a catalytic reaction featuring high reactant conversions and product yields. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, these and other objects have been achieved by the discovery of a novel process and accompanying copper oxide supported catalyst for the vapor phase formation of mono and di functional carboxylic acid alcohols and or esters containing about 1 to 20 carbon atoms from the corresponding mono and di functional carboxylic acids, i.e., mono and di functional aryl, aryl aliphatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids of 1 to 10 carbon, comprising contacting .the carboxylic acid with hydrogen gas, preferably in amounts ranging from about 500 1 to 3 1 moles H2 per mole of carboxylic acid, most preferably about 20 1 to 75 L, under reaction temperatures of about 175 3500C and pressures of about 50 5000 psig, in the presence of a copper oxide metal oxide supported, e.g., ZnAl2O4, ZnO, or SiO2, catalyst, with the preferred embodiment represented by the following stoichiometric formula CuaZnbAlcOd wherein a 0.1 0.9 b 0.1 1.0 c 2b d the number of oxygens determined by the valence requirements of the other elements. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Carboxylic acids which are suitable feedstocks for the process of the invention can comprise both mono and difunctional acids, preferably aryl, mixed aryl aliphatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids containing from one to about ten carbon atoms. The process is particularly suitable for the hydrogenation of saturated carboxylic acids of the formulaEMI3.1 wherein R represents a C1 to C10 branched or straight chain alkyl aryl, or mixed alkyl aryl moiety. Preferred carboxylic acids which can be converted to their corresond ing alcohol and or ester include acetic, n butyric, isobutyric, propionic, lactic, the valeric acids and the like.In the broadest embodiment of the invention, substantially any volatile Organic acid or acid mixture that has a boiling point below about 2500C may be suitable for use. In the broadest embodiment, the class of suitable catalysts can encompass a wide range of copper oxides in combination with other oxides, which can be chosen from a variety of metal oxide, e.g., non acidic supports and the like. Preferably, suitable compositions involve CuO with metal oxide support, i.e., ZnAl2O4, ZnO, SiO2, and the like, with no1204 the most preferred The preferred catalyst support can operate over a wide variety of proportions, as is seen in the following empirical formula CuaZnbAlcOd wherein a 0.1 0.9 b 0.1 1.0 c 2b d the number of oxygens determined by the valence requirements of the other elements.In CuO ZnAl 204 supported catalysts, the catalyst can comprise from about 1 to 80 wt. 8 copper oxide, most preferably, about 5 to 45 wt. copper oxide. The chemical reaction occurring during the process is that of a carboxylic acid reacting with hydrogen under appropriate conditions to form an alcohol and or ester product. This vapor phase hydrogenation may be carried out in any suitable catalytic reactor, such as an autoclave, a fluidized bed or, more preferably, a fixed bed tube reactor wherein the acid is first heated to the vaporous or gaseous state before being contacted with a suitable volume of hydrogen at effective pressures and temperatures in the presence of the selected hydrogenation catalyst. Since hydrogenation reactions are generally exothermic, a suitable cooling means can be employed to control and maintain the temperature within the desired range.The vapor phase reaction products produced by the reactor are recovered and suitably treated in conventional manner, such as by condensation and subsequent fractional distillation, so as to effect the separation of the products from the reactants. The copper oxide supported catalysts can be prepared by conventional methods known in the art, most preferably, the preferred catalysts are produced by forming a ZnA1204 spinel which is extruded and then depositing CuO by impregnation or by dry powder coating. The catalysts used in the process are preferably at least partially reduced before being utilized in the hydrogenation reaction. This prereduction may be carried out by contacting the catalyst with the reductant, preferably hydrogen gas, at a temperature ranging from about 500C to 3000C, preferably about 200QC to 3000C. The hydrogenation reaction is conducted in the vapor phase at temperatures ranging from about 1750C to about 3000C, preferably about 250 C to 2750C. The reaction pressure can generally range between about 50 to about 5000 psig, preferably about 100 to 1000 psig. Hydrogen gas is introduced into the reaction zone in excess with respect to the carboxylic acid in a molar ratio of at least 3 1, preferably about 75 1 to 20 1, and up to ratios of about 500 1. The carboxylic acid can be introduced if desired into the reaction zone in the presence of a suitable carrier, or solvent. Although it is preferred to proceed without employing a solvent, operable solvents for the hydrogenation process of the instant invention are the hydrocarbons and ethers, with selected alcohols also suitable in some instances. As mentioned above, it is preferred to employ the catalyst in the presence of a metal oxide support. Preferred supports beside the most preferred ZnAl204 are SiO2,ZnO, Silica alumina, alumina, oxides of groups IIA, IIIA,VIA metals, as well as various mixtures thereof. By following the process of this invention, a clean, simple, one step, low temperature and low pressure reaction can be obtained whereby the carboxylic acid is converted to the desired alcohol and or ester, depending upon the precise reaction conditions shown. Conditions favoring production of the alcohol are the higher pressure and temperature environments, while the conditions favoring production of the ester are the corresponding lower temperature and pressure ranges for suitable operation. The vapor phase hydrogenation catalysts employed in the process of this invention may be subject to a rapid loses o catalytic activity or degradation, due to several factors and conditions which must be carefully controlled, reduced or eliminated in order to make the resulting process economical. For example, catalyst poisoning and the resulting loss of catalytic activity therefrom, which is a substantial problem for copper oxide based catalysts, appears to be due to the uncontrolled or improper dispersion of the exothermic heat of reaction, which can cause hydrogenolysis of the resulting alcohol products, together with assisting in the formation of salts and polythermic esters which, when deposited on the catalyst, substantially decrease the hydrogenation activity thereof.Additional catalytic strength has been found to be extremely important and it is highly desirable that the finished catalyst retain its strength over a long period of exposure to reaction conditions. EXAMPLES Example 1. Preparation of CuO ZnAl2O4 Equimolar amounts of ZnO and Al2Oa formed by neutralization of the nitrates with Na2CO3 were intimately mixed, pasted and extruded 1 4 x lj16 .
