# Apparatus for measuring the length of weft yarn for a loom and a loom including such apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for measuring the weft yarn length for a loom comprises at least two weft yarn supply units 2A, 2B each having a weft yarn length measurement element 10 presenting a yarn winding surface 10a, 10b , at least two electric motors 5, 12 each adapted for winding weft yarn aroung said yarn winding surface of the measurement element, and weft yarn latching mechanisms 13 to 16, 17 to 20 for controlling the amount of the weft yarn wound on the winding surface and the transfer of the wound yarn in the weft inserting direction. The rotational speeds of the respec tive motors and the operation of the respective weft yarn latching mechanisms may be controlled by a control unit C1 in accordance with a preset weft yarn selection program. Each yarn length measurement element may be associ ated with a sensor 31 for sensing the number of times the weft yarn is wound on the element and for compensating for any fluctuations that may be caused in the measured lengths of the weft yarn.
