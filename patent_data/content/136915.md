# AREA WEAPON SIMULATION

## Abstract
An area weapon simulation for simulating minefields, gun batteries and the like in training exercises comprises means for scanning a narrow beam over a target field, means for detecting incidence of the beam on targets within the target field which field is typically 300m by 1500m and hit indicating means responsive to detected incidence of the beam on a target. The hit indicating means is enabled or disabled either in response to stored lethal area position data relating to the weapons or in response to a periodic signal representative of the stopping power of the weapons.
