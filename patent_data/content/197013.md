## Description
Substituted benzimidazoles for the manufacture of a treatment of intestinal inflammatory diseasesField of the InventionThe present invention is related to a method for the treatment of intestinal diseases, especially inflammatory intestinal diseases.Background of the InventionIntestinal diseases are a great problem to mankind. Examples of intestinal diseases are cholera, paratyphoid, tourist diarrhoea, toxin induced diarrhoea, ulcerous colitis and regional enteritis. In some bacterial diarrhoeas antibiotics or chemotherapeutics may be of value but in all severe cases treatment of fluid and electrolyte losses is the most important therapeutic principle. Symptomatic treatment with agents inhibiting the intestinal motility is usually of limited value.Control of water and salt losses in patients with diarrhoea is at present obtained by the administration of oral and or intravenous solutions of electrolytes. Drugs interfering with the transport of water and ions,like Na and K , across the gastrointestinal mucosa will be of great value in treatment of this type of diseases especially in earlier stages in order to prevent serious fluid disturbances.Outline of the InventionAccording to the present invention it has been found that the compounds with the general formula IEMI1.1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in which R1, R2, R3 andR4 are the same or different and are hydrogen alkyl containing 1 6 carbon atoms alkoxy containing 1 6 carbon atoms halogen, e.g.F, C1, Br I CF3 3 29 9 COR R is alkyl or cycloalkyl having 1 6 carbon atoms, aryl contain ing up to 10 carbon atoms optionally substituted by halogen, methyl or methoxy, or alkoxy containing 1 2 carbon atoms or wherein adjacent groups R1, R2, R3 and R4 together with the adjacent carbon atoms in the benzimidazole ring form a 5 or 6 membered ring containing 0 3 hetero atoms selected from N and 0 and which rings may be either saturated including one or two oxo groupsEMI2.1 directly attached to the benzimidazole ring or unsaturatedR5 is hydrogenR6 and R8, which are the same or different are hydrogen methyl or ethylR7 is hydrogen methyl methoxy ethoxy or aryloxy, wherein the aryl contains up to 10 carbon atoms, which may be optionally substituted by alkyl containing 1 6 carbon atoms provided that a when more than one of R6, R7 and R8 are hydrogen and R7 is other than aryloxy, then at laest two of R1, R2,R3 and R4 are hydrogen b when R7 is methoxy or ethoxy and R6 and R8 are hydrogen, then RR2, R3 and R4 are other than CN, NO2 or a 5 or 6 membered ring c when R7 is aryloxy then R1, R2, R3 and R4 cannot be CN, N02, CO aryl, COOCH3, COOC2H5 or a 5 or 6 membered ring d when more than one of R6, R7 and R8 are hydrogen and one of R1, R , R3 and R4 is CF3, then R7 is other than ethoxy e when R7 is methoxy, R6 and R8 are hydrogen and one of R1, R2, R3 and R4 is CF3, then the others of R1, R2, R3 and R4 must be hydrogen.Some of the substituted benzimidazoles with the general formula I are described in e.g. EP A1 5129. Others are described in BE A 898 880,EP A 80602, US A 4,182 766, US A 4 0450563, EP A 130729, DE A 3 415 971 and SE 416 649. The compounds of the formula 1, wherein R7 is a group containing an aromatic ring are disclosed in the Swedish patent application 8404065 8, which not yet is available to the public. The last mentioned compounds are prepared according to one of the following methods.a Oxidizing a compound of the formula IIEMI3.1 wherein X is S and R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 and R8 have the meanings given above, to give a compound of the formula I. The oxidation may be carried out by using an oxidizing agent selected from the group consisting of nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide, peracids, peresters, ozone, dinitrogentetraoxide, iodosobenzene, N halosuccinimide, l chlorobenzotriazole, t butylhypochlorite, diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octane bromine complex, sodium metaperiodate, selenium dioxide, manganese dioxide, chromic acid, cericammonium nitrate, bromine, chlorine, and sulfuryl chloride. The oxidation usually takes place in a solvent wherein the oxidizing agent is present in some excess in relation to the compound to be oxidized.The oxidation may also be carried out enzymatically by using an oxidating enzyme or microbiotically by using a suitable microorganism.b Hydrolyzing a compound of the formula IIIEMI4.1 wherein R1 R2, R3 R4 R5, R6, R7 and R8 are as defined above and Z is a suitable N protecting group such as alkanoyl, carboalkoxy and trimethylsilyl, to the formation of a compound of the formula I.The alkanoyl group in Z3 can have 1 6 carbon atoms and the carboalkoxy group 2 6 carbon atoms. The hydrolysis may be performed in alkaline solution.c Reacting a compound of the formula IVEMI4.2 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as defined above, X is S or SOand Y is K, Na or Li, with a compound of the formulaEMI5.1 wherein R6, R7 and R8 are as defined above and Z2 is halogen such as C1 or Br whereafter the compound obtained, when X is S , is oxidized to a compound of the formula I.The end products of the formula I are obtained as the free base.The preparation is further illustrated by the following examples.Example 1.

Stirring was continued at 2 C for 5 min and then NaHCO3 0.75 g, 0.0089 mol dissolved in water 50 ml was added under vigorous stirring. The two phases were separated and the CH2C12 phase was washed with water 20 ml . The organic phase was dried MgSO4 and the solvent was evaporated off. The residue was crystallized from CH3CN yielding the desired product 0.68 g, 57 , m.p. 146 C. Example 2. Method a. Preparation of 5 methoxy 2 4 4 methylphenoxy 2 pyridinyl methyllsulfinyl lH benzimidazole. m Chloroperbenzoic acid, 82 1.54 g, 0.0073 mol dissolved in CH2Cl2 20 ml was added under stirring to a cooled 5 C solution of 5 methoxy 2 4 4 mehylphenoxy 2 pyridinyl thio 1H benzimidazole 2.9 g, 0.0073 mol in CH2C12 50 ml maintaining the temperature at 50C. After the addition NaOH 0.87 g, 0.022 mol dissolved in water 30 ml was added under vigorous stirring. The two phases were separated. More CH2C12 was added to the aqueous phase, the pH was adjusted to 9.5 by adding 2M HC1 and after stirring the phases were separated.The organic phase was dried Na2SO4 and the solvent was evaporated off. The residue was crystallized from CH3CN yielding the desired product 1.2 g, 42 , m.p. 1210C.The compounds are known to inhibit gastric acid secretion and may thus be used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease.The antisecretory activity of the substituted benzimidazoles with the general formula I has been found to be mediated by inhibition of the gastric H ,K ATPase, exerted by certain degradation products. This enzyme is responsible for the pumping of protons into the stomach.Recently, a certain colon K ATPase enzyme has been shown to be located in the distal part of colon. c.f. Gustin, M.C. and Goodman, D.B.P. l981 J. Biol. Chem. 256, 10651 10656. The colon k ATPase is situated in the apical brush border membrane of the colonic epithelium cell and is postulated to be responsible for the absorptive transmembrane movement of K from the mucosal to the serosal side of the colon. This enzyme is thus believed to be of great importance for the electrolyte balance across the mucosal barrier in the colon.The two enzymes gastric H ,K ATPase and colon k ATPase appear to have similar but not the same way of acting. Gastric H ,K ATPase, which is located in the parietal cells, has a central role in the secretion of HC1 by the gastric epithelium. There are, however, no evidence that protons are secreted by the colon. As stated above the electrolytic balance is very often disturbed in diseases involving diarrhoeatic states. Thus compounds having an influence on the colonic K ATPase enzyme may be expected to be therapeutically valuable in the treatment of diseases involving diarrhoea.It has now surprisingly been found that also the colonic K AiPase enzyme is strongly inhibited in vitro by the above mentioned degradation products of the substituted benzimidazoles of the general formula I.Since such degradation products are formed, with the rate of formation dependent on the substituents in the two aromatic rings as well as on the surrounding pH es during the in vivo passage of the gastrointestinal tract, the compounds of the general formula I have thus a therapeutic effect on diarrhoea diseases. Examples of such diseases are inflammatory intestinal diseases such as cholera, paratyphoid, tourist diarrhoea and toxin induced diarrhoea but also other intestinal diseases such as ulcerous colitis and regional enteritis.The substituted benzimidazoles with the formula I may be used either as the free base or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, all of which are included within the scope of the invention. Thus, basic, neutral or mixed salts may be obtained as well as hemi, mono, sesqui or polyhydrates. In the preparation of alkaline salts the benzimidazole is reacted with NaOH, NaOR, NaNH2, NaNR2, Mg OR 2, Li OH, KOH, LiOR,LiNH2, LiNR2, KOR, KNH2, KNR2, Ca OR 2, CaH2, Ti OR 4, TiH4 orEMI7.1 wherein R is an alkyl group containing 1 4 carbon atoms.Preferred compounds with the general formula I are compounds, whereinI At least one of R1, R2, R3 and R4 is other than hydrogen and alkyl, wherein alkyl is as defined above II At least one of R1, R2, R3 and R4 is other than hydrogen, alkyl and alkoxy, wherein alkyl and alkoxy are as defined above III Not more than two of R1, R2, R3 and R4 are other than hydrogen, alkyl and alkoxy, wherein alkyl and alkoxy are as defined above IV Only one of R1, R2, R3 and R4 is other than hydrogen, alkyl and alkoxy, wherein alkyl and alkoxy are as defined above V Preferably R2 is a group other than hydrogen, alkyl or alkoxy, wherein alkyl and alkoxy are as defined above VI Preferably R1 is a group other than hydrogen, alkyl or alkoxy, wherein alkyl and alkoxy are as defined above VII Preferably R2 is a group other than hydrogen, alkyl or alkoxy and R1, R3 and R4 are hydrogen or alkyl, wherein alkyl and alkoxy are as defined above VIII Preferably R2 is a group other than hydrogen, alkyl or alkoxy and R1, R3 and R4 are hydrogen, wherein alkyl and alkoxy are as defined above Especially preferred benzimidazoles with the formula I are the compounds listed in the following Table 1, wherein the use of the first listed compound, omeprazole, is considered to be the best mode of carrying out the invention known at present.

Thus, omeprazole was decomposed in acid before it was added to the enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation from descending colonIn order to isolate and characterize the ouabain insensitive potassiumstimulated ATPase from rabbit descending colon the following preparation was made.Apical brush border membranes were prepared from rabbit descending colon epithelium, by the method of Gustin M.C., and Goodman D.B.P., J. Biol.Chem. 256, 10651 10656 1981 , with some modifications.Two albino male rabbits, weighing 2 3 kg, were killed by injection of mebumal into the ear vein. A section of colon, 30 35 cm in length, measured from rectum, was removed, rinsed free of its content with icecold 0.15 M NaCl and everted over a glassrod. The tissue was then divided in two pieces. These everted segments were tied at one end, filled with an icecold buffer containing 30 mM NaCl, 5mM Na3EDTA and 8 mM Hepes Tris pH 7.6, using a 20 nil syringe without a needle, until they became distended, at which point the other end was tied. The intestines were transferred to a 500 ml centrifuge tube containing the same cold pH 7.6 buffer. The tube was placed in an icebox, which was shaken for 2 hours at 260 osc. min. Then the incubation medium was filtered through a nylon net of 200 pm mesh, to remove debris. Sedimentation of epithelial cells was performed by centrifugation at 500xg for 10 minutes at 4 C, in a Beckman J2 21 centrifuge. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 250 ml of a solution containing lmM Na3EDTA, adjusted to pH 8.3 with HC1 at 4 C, just before use. The cells were then disrupted, by a 28 second homogenization in a Waring Blendor. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4 C with a centrifugal force of 750xg in a Beckman J2 21 centrifuge with a JA 17 rotor, in order to sediment brush borders. Pellets were combined, resuspended in 40 ml of the medium containing lmM Na3EDTA and recentrifuged as described above.The brush border pellet P2 was resuspended in 33.3 ml of the same medium, 2.7 ml density gradient medium Percoll, Pharmacia was added by mixing. The Percoll medium was allowed to generate a density gradient during 22 minutes at 40 OOOxg in a Beckman J2 21 centrifuge, in which the membranes sedimented into bands. Nine fractions Gl G9 of 4 ml each, were carefully removed from the gradient with a Pasteur pipette. The fractions were subjected to centrifugation in a Kontron TGA 65 centrifuge with a TST 60 swing out rotor at 50 000 rpm for 45 minutes, to sediment the Percoll. The material collected on the top of the Percoll pellet was homogenized by a glass teflon homogenizer with 5 10 up down strokes at about 1500 rpm.Determination of ATPase activityATPase activity was determined as the amount of Pj free phosphate liberated from ATP by the enzyme per unit of time.The assay medium contained 2mM ATP, 2mM Mac12, 18.4 mM Pipes Tris pH 7.4 and membrane protein in the presence or absence of 10 mM KC1 in a final volume of 1 ml. In some experiments, 10 5 M of the specific Na ,K ATPase inhibitor ouabain was present. The enzyme Na ,K ATPase is responsible for the active transport of Na out from the cell into the plasma as well as for the transport of K into the cell from the plasma.Unless otherwise mentioned, the preparation was preincubated with ouabain on ice for 10 minutes before start of the reaction, which was initiated with ATP, mixed and incubated for suitable time at 370C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml icecold 12 per cent perchloric acid, containing 3.6 per cent ammoniummolybdate. 3 ml butylacetate was added and the testtubes were shaken on a mixer for 15 seconds in order to extract the phosphbmolybdate complex into the organic phase. The absorbance of this complex was measured at 320 nm against a reagent blank.Inhibition by acid decomposed omeprazoleOmeprazole was dissolved in methanol to a concentration of 20 mM. 100 p1 of this solution, was diluted to 10 ml with a buffer, which gave a final concentration of 0.2 mM omeprazole and 2 mM Na Acetate HC1, pH 5.0.A control medium was made in the same way, without omeprazole present.These media were treated for 120 minutes at 37 C. The reaction was quenched by addition of an equivalent volume of 150 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4.The control medium was treated in the same way.10 pg colon apical membrane samples were incubated for 10 minutes at 37 C with the quenched solutions, giving the concentrations of omepra zole indicated in the result table, in final volumes of 1 ml. The K stimulated ATPase activity was determined for 10 minutes.

Thus, omeprazole may be used in the treatment of intestinal diseases, wherein the electrolyte balance across the mucosal barrier in the colon is disturbed. Pharmaceutical preparationsIn clinical use the compounds of the invention are administered orally, in the form of a pharmaceutical preparation which does not release the active sulphoxide compound before it reaches the colon and which contains the sulphoxide either as a free base or as a pharmaceutically acceptable, non toxic alkaline salt, such as the Li , Na , K , Mg2t, Oa2 or NH4 salts in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier may be in the form of a solid, semisolid or liquid diluent, or a capsule. The technique to control the release in the above mentioned way has been previously described in EP A 64 485 as well as in Bogentoft, C. et al., Acta Pharm.Suec., 20, 311 314 1983 Delivery of drugs to the colon by means of a new microencapsulated oral dosage form and Dew, M.J. et al., Br. J. Clin. Pharmac., 14, 405 408 1982 An oral preparation to Release Drugs in the Human Colon .The compounds can also be administered rectally in the form of a pharmaceutical preparation formulated to transport the sulphoxide to the ascending colon, such as a suitably formulated suppository, rectal foam or enema. Usually the amount of active compound is between 2 and 50 by weight of the preparations.In the preparation of pharmaceutical preparations containing a compound of the present invention in the form of dosage units for oral administration the compound selected may be mixed with a solid, pulverulent carrier, such as lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, starch, amylopectin, cellulose derivatives or gelatin, as well as with an anti friction agent such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, and polyethyleneglycol waxes. The mixture is then processed into pellets or tablets.The above prepared cores are coated with a specially formulated coating, which renders the formulation the release characteristics described above. To this coating various dyes may be added in order to distinguish among formulations with different active compounds or with different amount of the active compound present. Soft gelatine capsules may be prepared,which capsules contain a mixture of the active sulphoxide compound or compounds of the invention and vegetable oil. Hard gelatine capsules may contain granules of the active sulphoxide compound in combination with a solid, pulverulent carrier as lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, potato starch, corn starch, amylopectin, cellulose derivatives or gelatine. The capsules are coated as previously described.The typical daily dose of the active substance varies within a wide range and will depend on various factors such as for example the individual requirement of each patient, the route of administration and the disease.In general, oral and rectal dosages will be in the range of 1 to 500 mg per day, or more specifically 5 100 mg per day of active substance.
