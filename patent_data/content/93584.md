# Gear mounting.

## Abstract
In a gear mounting having a spindle 16 extending generally normal to a carrier, the spindle 16 is cantilevered back from the outer end of a tie bolt 14 and is permitted limited axial excursions to adapt itself to the tooth loading. It is particularly suited to mounting planets in an epicyclic gear. The outer end of the spindle 16 is clamped between the head of the tie bolt 14 and a tubular compression member 15 of lesser axial extent than the spindle 16 , and between that member and the carrier there is a bush 17 , also in the compression chain. The tubular member 15 is more flexible than the bush 17 and the bolt 14 can also flex to allow the axial excursions. The tubular member 15 may be integral with the bush 17 or separate from it, but in either case the geometry of the various components can be such that easy tolerances are permissible to facilitate assembly. However, when the tie bolt 14 is tensioned distortions occur to close radial clearances and centralise the components. An application of this mounting is to an epicyclic gear in which there are double planets whose parts are of different pitch to give an added reduction.
