# Manufacture of metal articles from wire.

## Abstract
A multipart article comprising a rod or pin 26 with a sleeve or collar 58 on it is made from one piece of wire by parting off a blank, impact extruding a stem to form the pin or rod, backward extruding a residual portion of the blank to form the sleeve or collar with an internal diameter slightly larger than the diameter of the stem and joined to the stem by a short thin web 64 , and then fracturing the web and inserting the pin or rod into the thus separated sleeve or collar. The advantage in manufacturing small articles on a mass production basis is in the economy of forming two parts in one machine operation rather than making them separately, an example being parts of a blind riveting assembly.
