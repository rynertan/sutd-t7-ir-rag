# Air swirl nozzle.

## Abstract
A fuel nozzle wherein a swirl cone 36 is located between a housing 10 and a body 12 , The body 12 co operates with the housing 10 to form an air chamber 32 and with the cone 36 to form an inner annulus 40 . Swirl vanes 34 are angularly mounted between the cone 36 and the body 12 such that air flowing from the chamber 32 into the annulus 40 forms a swirling flow pattern. The body 12 is provided with a fuel chamber 16 and radial passages 20 introduce fuel to the swirling air in the inner annulus 40 to produce an atomized spray pattern.
