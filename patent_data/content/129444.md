## Description
The present invention relates to a method for obtaining high purity carbon monoxide from a feed gas, such as off gases from converters furnace or blast furnaces, containing carbon dioxide and nitrogen in addition to carbon monoxide by a modification of the pressure swing adsorption PSA technique. Off gases from refining vessels used in iron mills contain fairly large amounts of carbon monoxide. The chemical composition of off gases from a converter and a blast furnace are listed below. High purity CO recovered from these off gases at low cost could be used as a raw material for synthesis of chemicals or as a gas to be blown into molten metal in refining vessels. Most reactions for the synthesis of chemicals require high temperatures and pressures, and therefore, the CO used should have the lowest possible content of CO₂ that corrodes the reactor by oxidation. In order to ensure a high reaction efficiency, N₂ that usually does not take part in the reaction should be removed as much as possible. While various gases are blown into a refining vessel for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of metal refining argon that is expensive is typically used in order to avoid the increase in the concentrations of impure gases e.g. H₂ and N₂ in the molten metal. Since off gases are produced in large quantities from converters and blast furnaces in an iron mill, high purity CO recovered from these gases at low cost could be used as an almost equally effective alternative to argon. In this case, the nitrogen content of the high purity CO should be as low as possible for the purpose of preventing the increase in the N₂ content of molten iron. Furthermore, the CO₂ concentration should desirably be low in order to prevent oxidative attack of the carbon base refractory lining of refining vessel. It has been proposed to recover high purity CO from off gases from iron mills either by deep freezing separation or by solution absorption techniques such as the copper solution method and cosorb method. However, the deep freezing separation technique requires low temperature and high pressure, whereas the solution absorption technique requires high temperature and pressure. Furthermore, both techniques need complicated and expensive equipment. Another disadvantage with the deep freezing technique is that the boiling points of N₂ and CO are so close to each other that their complete separation is very difficult. Therefore, the present inventors looked to adsorption techniques for recovering high purity CO by a simpler and less expensive process. The objective of the inventors was to recover high purity CO not only from off gases from refining furnaces but also from off gases from petroleum refineries and chemical synthesis plants, as well as from off gases resulting from the partial oxidation or hydroreforming of natural gas and heavy hydrocarbon oils. Separation of gases by pressure swing adsorption is known, and methods for recovery of less strongly adsorbable gases those components which are not easily adsorbed on an adsorbent are shown in Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 23928 63 and 15045 63. However, as far as the inventors know, nobody has succeeded in recovery of high purity CO from off gases containing not only nitrogen but also carbon dioxide which has a high tendency to be absorbed together with carbon monoxide. U.S. Serial No. 517,272 by Matsui et al filed on July 26, 1983 US A 4.468.238 which was assigned to the assignee of this invention discloses removal of nitrogen from mixture comprising nitrogen and carbon monoxide or nitrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. However, Matsui et al does not disclose separation of carbon dioxide from said mixture. EP A 0 008 512 discloses a pressure swing adsorption process for recovering hydrogen and carbon dioxide from a mixture of H₂, CO₂ and CO. When present, N₂ contained in said mixture is recovered as part of a so called secondary component in admixture with CO. An object of this invention is to provide a process for separating CO from a mixture comprising at least CO₂, CO and N₂ through PSA process. Another object of this invention is to provide a process for separating CO from a mixture comprising at least CO₂, CO and N₂ in which Matsui Still another object of this invention is to provide a process for separating CO from a mixture comprising at least CO₂, CO and N₂ in which adsorption step is carried out at a near atmospheric pressure for saving energy for pressurizing adsorption columns. According to the invention there is provided a process for separating carbon monoxide from a feed gas comprising CO₂, CO and N₂ by PSA in a two stage adsorption operation which comprises a first adsorption stage for removing CO₂ from said feed gas and a second adsorption stage for separating CO from gaseous mixture withdrawn as first stage product gas from the first adsorption stage After step ii is completed and before step iii is started, part of the gaseous mixture remaining in the column may be removed outside all the adsorption columns. Preferably said first adsorption stage comprises The adsorbents employed in the practice of the first and second adsorption stages of this invention include natural or synthetic zeolites, molecular sieves, activated carbon and the like. Mordenite type zeolite and adsorbent obtained by grinding mordenite type zeolite, followed by sintering the reformed zeolite with a binding agent are preferable. In the first adsorption stage, carbon dioxide is removed from a mixture comprising CO, CO₂ and more poorly adsorbable component than CO, such as nitrogen through PSA. The preferable first adsorption stage comprises in the following At least two adsorption columns containing an adsorbent exhibiting selective absorb property to carbon dioxide are used. The process comprises Steps of the second adsorption stage are explained in detail in the following In this step, the first stage product gas is introduced into an adsorption column to increase pressure in the columns. Since gas to be recovered according to this invention is easily adsorbable component, too high adsorption pressure is unnecessary. In general, the adsorption pressure of as low as 3 kg cm² G 400 kPa is sufficient. The adsorption pressure of less than 1 kg cm² G 200 kPa , for example 0.1 kg cm² G 110 kPa can also be used. However, adsorption pressure of more than 3 kg cm² G 400 kPa may be used. Adsorption step is continued until the concentration of the easily adsorbable component, for example CO, in the gas leaving the adsorption column becomes equal to the concentration of the same component entering the adsorption column, or until just before the time when the two concentrations become equal. When step ii is completed, the concentration of the poorly adsorbable component is relatively high around the exit of the column. So, part of the gaseous mixture remaining in the column may be removed outside all the adsorption columns in order to enhance purity of the product gas. It is preferable that the gaseous mixture remaining in the column may be removed to a pressure of three fourth one fifth of adsorption pressure. This step is optional. The adsorption column, in which step iii was previously completed, is connected to the other adsorption column, in which step vi is previously completed to withdraw the gas component from the former column and introduce it into the latter column, thereby reducing the pressure in the former adsorption column to one atmosphere or a pressure close to it. The pressure in the former adsorption column may be reduced to near pressure equalization of the two columns. Product gas is passed through the adsorption column, in which step iv was previously completed, to purge nitrogen between the adsorbent particles. It is preferable that the pressure in this step is lower than the adsorption pressure and is higher than one atmosphere. In general, it may be unnecessary to use pump and the step may be carried out by connecting the adsorption column to storage tank for product gas. The product gas is cocurrently passed through the column. The adsorption column, in which step v was previously completed, is evacuated to a pressure below one atmospheric pressure by means of vacuum pump, blower ejector in order to recover product gas, CO. It is preferable that the column is evacuated to a pressure less than 300 Torr 40 kPa , more preferable to 30 100 Torr 4 13.3 kPa . The adsorption column, in which step vi was previously completed, is connected to the other adsorption column, in which step ii was previously completed, to pressurize the former column by introducing gas from the latter column to the former column. Preferably, introduction of the gas is cocurrently carried out. This step is continued until the pressure in the latter column is reduced to one atmosphere or a pressure close to it. In end of this step, the pressure in the former column is less than one atmosphere. The pressure in the former adsorption column may be increased to near pressure equalization of the two columns. The gas withdrawn in step v of the other adsorption column is introduced into the adsorption column, in which step vii was previously completed. According to one aspect of the present invention, adsorption is carried out at nearly atmospheric pressure. The present invention generally relates to a method of separating carbon monoxide in a feed gas containing nitrogen as well as carbon monoxide, using at least two adsorption columns packed with an adsorbent selective for carbon monoxide such as activated carbon, synthetic or natural zeolite or a mixture thereof. The present invention is explained by typical embodiment, but not limit the scope of this invention. Figure 3 is a flowsheet of the continuous adsorptive process of separating and concentrating carbon monoxide after removing carbon dioxide and nitrogen from converter off gases. Adsorption columns A and B are packed with an adsorbent selective for carbon dioxide. The two columns are evacuated to 100 Torr 13.3 kPa , preferably to 60 Torr 8 kPa , with a vacuum pump. Then, the feed gas is introduced into column A through a valve 1, with the other valves in the system left closed. At this time, column B is maintained in at under pressure, that is, in vacuum. After column A is pressurized, and is maintained at 0.01 3.0 kg cm² G 101 400 kPa , preferably 0.2 1.0 kg cm² G 120 200 kPa . Valve 2 is opened, and CO₂ and part of CO are adsorbed on or in the adsorbent and the remainder of the feed gas. After a definite amount of the feed gas is passed through column A for a given time, valves 1 and 2 are closed. Then, valve 3 is open, and pressure of column A is decreased to near one atmospheric pressure. Valve 3 is closed and valve 4 is open, so column A is evacuated by vacuum pump, blower or ejector to, preferably 100 Torr 13.3 kPa and more preferably, 30 Torr 4 kPa in order to desorb carbon dioxide. Valve 5 is open at this time, amount of gas for purge is adjusted by hand valve 14 , whereby CO₂ remaining on or in the adsorbent is purged by passing through the waste gas of the second adsorption stage. Then the pressure of column A is 270 Torr. Then valves 4 and 5 are closed, and valve 6 is open, so column A is pressurized by introducing the product gas thereto. The flow between or among said columns is switched. In the second adsorption stage, CO is separated from the first stage product gas. Adsorption columns C, D, E and F contain an adsorbent exhibiting selective adsorbing property to carbon monoxide. Adsorption columns C, D, E and F are evacuated to 100 Torr 1.33 kPa , preferably 30 Torr 4 kPa by means of vacuum pump 41. Valve 16 is open. The first stage product gas is introduced into adsorption column C. The rate of increase in pressure of column C is adjusted by valve 15. In the adsorption step, valves 17 and 18 are open and at the same time, valve 16 is closed. Introduction of the first stage product gas is continued. Carbon monoxide is adsorbed on or in the adsorbent and more poorly adsorbable component, i.e. nitrogen is passed through column C. Some of the component passing through column C is used as a gas for purge in the first adsorption stage. The remainder of the component can be used as fuel, because it contains considerable amount of CO. The remainder of the component is stored in tank 43. Adsorption step is continued by passing definite amount of the first stage product gas through column C for a given time. Valves 17 and 18 are closed and valve 19 is open. Pressure of column C is reduced to one atmospheric pressure and the gas withdrawn from column C is introduced into column D. Then valve 20 is open and part of the second stage product gas is introduced from product tank 42 for purging the gas remaining in the portion between the absorbent particles. The gas withdrawn in the purging step is utilized for pressurizing the other column. Then valves 19 and 20 are closed and valve 21 is open. So, column C is evacuated by vacuum pump to desorb carbon monoxide from the adsorbent. The pressure of column C is reduced to less than 300 Torr 40 kPa , preferably 300 30 Torr 40 4 kPa . The flow between or among said columns is switched so as to repeat the above steps in the columns. Tank for waste gas is shown at 43. Carbon monoxide can be separated from a mixture comprising CO, CO₂ and more poorly adsorbable component, N₂ by combining the first adsorption stage and the second adsorption stage. Particularly, the waste gas of the second adsorption stage can be used as a gas for purge of the first adsorption stage. The product gas, CO separated according to the present invention contains CO₂ of less than 0.5 and N₂ of less than 1 . The embodiments shown in Figures 4 and 5 relate to separation of CO from the first stage product gas and another feed gas comprising carbon monoxide and more poorly adsorbable component, such as nitrogen. The embodiment shown in Figure 4 is explained in the following. Adsorption columns A and B contain adsorbent exhibiting selective adsorbing property to carbon monoxide. Columns A and B are evaporated to 30 Torr, preferably 60 Torr by means of vacuum pump 111. Valve 101 is open and valves 102 110 are closed. Column A is pressurized by introducing feed gas thereinto. Column B is still maintained at a pressure close to vacuum. Valve 103 is open. Introduction of feed gas into column A is continued at a pressure of 0.1 3.0 kg cm² G 110 400 kPa , preferably 0.2 1.0 kg cm² G 120 200 kPa . Then valve 101 is closed. Valve 103 is open and part of the gas remaining in proportion around exit of column A is discharged to 0.1 0.75 kg cm² G 110 175 kPa outside all of the columns. Then valve 103 is open and valve 105 is closed to connect column A to column B. The gas discharged from column A is introduced to column B until pressure of column is reduced to near one atmospheric pressure. The valve 105 is closed and valve 107 is open, so part of the product gas is passed through column A from tank 112 for product gas to purge poorly adsorbable component, N₂ remaining in column A. CO concentration of gas withdrawn in the purging step is higher than that in feed gas. So, the gas withdrawn in the purging step can be utilized for pressurizing the other column. Then valve 107 is closed and valve 109 is open, so column A is evacuated by means of vacuum pump to recover product gas, CO from the adsorbent of column A. In general, pressure of column A is reduced to less than 300 Torr 40 kPa , preferably 300 30 Torr 40 4 kPa . The flow between or among the columns is switched. Tank for waste gas is shown at 113. This invention is further illustrated by the following examples, but not limit the scope. In this example, off gas from converter furnace having the following components was used. PSA consisting of adsorption, depressurization, evacuation, purge, and pressurization by product, pressurization by feed gas was used in the first adsorption stage. PSA consisting of pressurization by first stage product gas, adsorption, depressurization, purge, evacuation and pressurization by gas withdrawn from the other column was used in the second adsorption stage. In the first stage, steel columns 12⁸ 1.7 m containing Zeoharb available by Osaka Sanso Kogyo Ltd. 50 kg 1 8 inch pellet were used. In the second stage, steel columns 16⁸ 2.4 m containing activated Zeoharb 166 kg 1 8 inch pellet were used. All columns were evacuated to 100 Torr 13 kPa in the first stage and all columns were evacuated to 60 Torr 8 kPa in the second stage. Said off gas was fed into first stage columns at line speed of 6 cm sec. 32.8 Cubic meter of said off gas was used. 19.3 Cubic meter of product gas, carbon monoxide was obtained. Amount of waste gas was 13.5 cubic meter. Yield of CO was 68 .
