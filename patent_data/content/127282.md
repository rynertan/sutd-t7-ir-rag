# IMPROVED ACTIVE AGENT DISPENSER

## Abstract
The release pattern of a dispersion type active agent dis penser can be improved by forming the device from a depleted zone containing the agent at a concentration no greater than the saturation and a non depleted zone contain ing the agent dispersed in the matrix at a uniform concentra tion greater than saturation. The depleted zone is disposed between the surface through which the agent is to be dis pensed and at least a substantial portion of the non depleted zone with the interface therebetween disposed at a non uniform distance from the releasing surface. Certain embod iments are particularly useful for the transdermal administra tion of drugs.
