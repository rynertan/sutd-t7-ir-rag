# Combined control of a supercharger and an auxiliary device both mechanically driven by the engine.

## Abstract
A supercharger is applied to the combination of an engine 10 , an air intake passage 12 through which air is conducted to the engine, and an auxiliary device 20 con nectable to the engine to be driven by the engine. The supercharger includes a compressor 14 disposed in the air intake passage 12 to compress air conducted to the engine. The compressor is connectable to the engine to be driven by the engine. A sensor 26 is provided to sense whether or not the power output required of the engine 10 is higher than a predetermined level. A first clutch 18 responsive to the sensor 26 disconnects the compressor 14 from the engine 10 , when the power output required of the engine is not higher than the predetermined level. A second clutch 24 responsive to the sensor 26 disconnects the auxiliary device 20 from the engine 10 when the power output required of the engine is higher than the predetermined level.
