# Sorters for collating sheets into sets.

## Abstract
A sorter for collating sheets into sets comprises a plurality of sheet receiving bins B defined by an array of movable plates 1 5, 5a and an indexing wheel 23 for indexing the input ends of the bin plates sequentially past a fixed feed throat 22 to align the bin openings in turn with the feed throat 22 . Adjacent bin plates 1 5, 5a are relatively movable apart and together for varying the sizes of the bin openings and are interconnected to limit their maximum spacing. The bin plates are spaced apart opposite and at one side of the feed throat 22 and arranged together on the other side of feed throat. The indexing wheel 23 engages the bin plates 1 5, 5a sequentially and the bin plates are biassed away from the indexing wheel in one direction and their interconnection permits engagement thereof by the indexing wheel 23 in opposition to said bias. The indexing wheel 23 suitably has a discontinuous annular flange.
