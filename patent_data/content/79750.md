# Parallel cylinder internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
The engine disclosed herein comprises a number of pairs of pistons, PA,PA the two pistons in each pair acting in unison and the number of pairs being arranged parallel to each other and said pistons also being positioned parallel to and in a circle around the mainshaft 1 which has a cam lobe 3 located at a convenient part of the mainshaft and encircling the mainshaft. The cam lobe 3 has opposite surfaces which have rises and dips, or in other words, sinusoidal surfaces, and are in contact with pairs of bearings 6 attached to connecting rods, these bearings being on opposite sides of the cam lobe and at one time being driven in one direction by one of the two pistons in each pair and then at another time in the opposite direction by the other piston in that pair, the two pistons of that pair being connected to each other by the same connecting rod 4,5 carrying the bearings 6 which press against the cam lobe 3 . The pressure exerted first by one bearing and then by the opposite bearing in concert with similar thrusts from the other pairs of bearings and pistons, causes a steady, even rotation of the shaft 1 on its linear axis. The action of the pistons and bearings is arranged and timed so that pressure against the surface of the cam lobe exerts vector forces against the curved surface of the cam lobe 3 to effect rotation of the main shaft. Centerline thrust of the bearings against the cam surface and special design of the cam surface to avoid friction or binding between the bearings and the cam are special features of this engine. The pistons may be driven by combustion fuels, including gasoline, diesel, etc., and may also be adapted to steam operation. By appropriate changes, this engine may be operated as a compressor.

## Description
PARALLEL CYLINDER INTERNAL COMi3USTION ENGINE This invention relates to a new type of parallel piston engine. More specifically it relates to a circular arrangement of pistons and cylinders around a mainshaft which pistons act in concert to effect rotation of the mainshaft by virtue of pressure exerted on the sinusoidal surfaces of a cam lobe encircling the mainshaft.Still more specifically the cam surface is specially designed to avoid friction and binding between the bearings and cam surface. Various types of engines for developing mechanical power, such as for propelling vehicles, have been proposed and are in use. The most commonly used is the internal combustion engine. However, in Spite of their widespread use, there are a number of disadvantages in the types of engines used, namely vibration, low efficiency, pollution, etc. Vibration is generally due to the type of arrangement of the pistons with relation to the drive shaft, which in combination with poor timing, unequal power distribution, etc. is very inefficient in eliminating vibration although much has been done in absorbing vibration or otherwise eliminating its transmission to the passenger riding portion of an automobile. Since rotary engines may have pistons equally spaced around the mainshaft through which power is transmitted, it is conceivable that such engines might have less problems with vibration. A number of patents have been published in which pistons are arranged parallel to a mainshaft which is driven by a cam rotated by the action of the pistons. However none of these have met with commercial success. Such patents areU. S. Patents Nos. 1,229,009 1,352,985 1,487,338 l,802, J902 2,027,076 and 2,966,899 and British Patent No. 251,607 1926 . The lack of commercial success of the engines shown in these patents is believed to be due to a number of defects therein in which the designs do not provide for centerline thrust between the pistons, bearings and cam surface and the cam surfaces are not designed to avoid friction and binding between the bearings and the cam surfaces. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, a parallel cylinder engine has been designed which operates with excellent fuel efficiency, little or no vibration, a minimum of exhaust pollution and a reduction ofsfrietion and freedom of binding between bearings and cam surfaces. This engine has multiple pistons and cylinders arranged parallel to and in a circle around a mainshaft. The pistons and cylinders are arranged in pairs, each pair having a common axis with a connecting rod connecting the two pistons. In a 2 cycle engine, one of the pistons in the pair goes through a firing cycle while its partner goes through a compression cycle and the two operate sequentially to drive the connecting rod back and forth along the common axis of the two cylinders. In a preferred modification, each connecting rod has attached to it a pair of roller bearings each of which alternately presses and rides against a cam lobe encircling the mainshaft. In this preferred modification, this cam lobe has two sinuisoidal surfaces each having two symmetrically disposed high points or rises, and 960 from these high points there are corresponding low points or reverse rises with curved portions connecting these respective points. In other words, this cam lobe has two rises or high points 1800 from each other and 900 from each high point there is a correspondinc low point or a high point in the opposite direction reverse rise with curved sections connecting adjacent high and low points. While the surfaces of the cam lobe are sinusoidal, they are not parallel to each other since the thickness of the cam lobe varies between the rises as explained in greater detail hereinafter.Moreover, as explained hereinafter, the sinusoidal curves differ in slope from the outer edge of the cam surface bearing contact area as compared to the inner edge of the cam surface bearing contact area, and also with respect to the center of the bearing contact area, as explained hereinafter. When a connecting rod moves in one directîon in the path of its linear axis, one of the bearings carried by this connecting rod presses on the curved surface be tween a high and low point on the cam lobe, and by vector force, causes rotation of the mainshaft. In the automotive industry, a stroke of the piston or rod from one extreme position to its extreme position in the opposite direction is known as a stroke or cycle. Thus in going through intake, compression, power and exhaust, the piston and connecting rÏd goes through four strokes or cycles.With an engine having eight pairs of cylinders and pistons or 16 individual cylinders and pistons, there are 16 firings per revolution of the shaft which translates to 4 cycles per piston in one revolution of the mainshaft, and which results in a very smooth power transmission to the shaft with little or no vibration and with high efficiency. An important feature of the engine of this invention is that the cam surface is designed to compensate for the friction and binding that results when a cylindrical bearing is rotated on a surface while the axis of the bearing is maintained in a position with its axis projected at a 900 angle to the axis of the mainshaft. Thus the outer edge of the bearing travels a path on the cam surface which has a greater circumferential distance than the path traveled by the inner edge of the bearing. However, since the two edges are on the same cylindrical surface, points on the outer edge must travel the same distance as respective points on the inner edge. Therefore, in view of these differences in the circumferential paths of the two edges on the cam surface, friction and binding develops as the bearing is rotated.The engine of this invention has a novel cam surface design which compensates for this difference and by a ratio compensation design of this surface, avoids the friction and binding which otherwise develops. In this design, the centerline of the area of contact of the cam with a bearing is a sinusoidal curve whereas the lines of contact of the cam with the outer edge and inner edge of the bearing define lines respectively which are also sinusoidal curves but different from the centerline sinusoidal curve in that the outer sinusoidal curve has a lesser slope and the inner sinusoidal curve has a steeper slope relative to the centerline sinusoidal curve. This arrangement compensates by equalizing the ratio of the travel distance of the inner ahd outer edges of the bearing. In addition to the novel design of this engine, the cam itself is considered novel as well as the process and apparatus described hereinafter for its production. Moreover, with the engine of this invention there are a number of other important advantages, First, as stated above, there are 16 firings per revolution of the mainshaft with four cycles or strokes for each piston whereas with the present 8 cylinder engine, there are only two cycles per revolution of the crankshaft. Second, the distance of the contact point of the connecting rod bearing with the cam lobe to the axis of the mainshaft exceeds the stroke of the piston thereby giving improved leverage and requiring less power to turn the mainshaft as compared to present engines. Third, because of the higher number of cylinder firings permitted per revolution, this new engine design can use a lower compression ratio. Consequently, low octane fuel may be used efficiently. Moreover, a higher air ratio or leaner mixture can be used thereby resulting in more efficient use of fuel. Fourth, since the engine is more compact in design, the size and weight of the engine may be very much smaller as compared to the present engines. For example, for comparable power production, this engine will weigh one fourth less than the standard present engines. Fifth, the engine design lends itself to the use of various fuels such as gasoline, diesel fuel and is even adaptable to the use of steam. Sixth, the engine can be air cooled, in which case blades may be attached to the mainshaft to propel air through cooling fins or other suitable means. Seventh, the cam plate design of this new engine permits increased travel for the lifter cam and thereby decreases the amount of spring pressure needed for valve closing and gives infinite variations in valve operation, including duration of lifts, etc. Moreover, other advantages will become obvious upon detailed description of the invention.Brief Description of the Drawings The description of the engine of this invention is facilitated by reference to the drawings in which Fig. A represents a diagram used for making calculations pertinent to the diagram of the cam of this invention.

Figs. 8a through 8i represent cross sections of the bearing contact portion of the cam of this invention cut by planes coinciding with the centerline of the mainshaft and extending to the exterior of the cam at angles of 00, 22.50, 450, 67.50 and 900 respectively Figs. 9a through 9i represent cross sections of a cam cut as in Figs. 8a through 8i having sinusoidal curves but not the ratio compensating features of the present invention. Fig. 10 is a side elevational cross sectional view of a modification adapted for use as a compressor in which modificatiqn the sinusoidal surfaces are outer surfaces of the cam lobe. Fig. 11 is a side elevational cross sectional view of a modification adapated for use as a compressor in which modification the sinusoidal surfaces are the sides of a sinusoidal groove cut in the annular surface of the cam lobe and Fig. 12 is a side elevational view of a cam lobe showing a sinusoidal groove in its annular surface. In the engine of this invention, the centerlines of the pistons and the centerlines of the connecting rods between pistons travel in lines parallel to the axis or centerline of the mainshaft. It is important, in order to avoid vector forces that will give a sideward thrust, that the line of contact points of a bearing against the cam embraces the centerline of a pair of pistons and that the direction of force applied by the bearing against the cam preferably substantially coincides with the centerline of said pair of pistons so as to impart centerline thrust . Each of the bearings attached to the connecting rods is maintained in a position so that its axial centerline is pointed in such a direction that the imaginary extension of this centerline intersects the axis centerline of the mainshaft at a 900 angle. This positioning of the bearing is effected by having a portion of the connecting rod slide in a groove which prevents the connecting rod, as well as the pistons connected thereto, from rotating or revolving on their respective centerlines or axes. This gives the effect of having the bearing rotate on an imaginary axle. which extends to and at a 900 angle to the centerline of the mainshaft. Since the bearing travels upward and downward on the rises and valleys of the cam, this imaginary axle slides up and down on the mainshaft centerline to maintain its 900 anglo therewith. Imagine that the bearing travels on a flat cam surface and rotates on its imaginary axle, the contact points of the bearing comprise a straight line parallel to the axis or centerline of the cylindrical bearing. As the bearing thereafter rotates, each point of that straight line travels the same distance for each revolution of the bearing.However, the radius R from the centerline of the mainshaft to the outermost point on that line or the outer edge of the bearing is greater than the radius R from the innermost point on that line or the inner edge of the bearing. This difference in radii comprises the width W of the bearing. Coasequently, as the bearing is rotated on its imaginary axle, the circumference of the path of the outermost point on the cam surface has a relationship to 2sR and the circumference of the path at the innermost point on the cam surface has a relationship to 2sR . However, as discussed above, the radius of the circumferential path of the innermost point is shorter than the radius of the circumferential path of the outermost point by the width of the bearing, or in other words, R R W. Therefore, the innermost point travels a shorter circumferential distance by the amount of 2nR 2 R W , or 2wRt 2wR 2sW, or 2nW than the circumfer .ential distance traveled by the corresponding outermost point. Next imagine that the cam surface instead of being flat is a sinusoidal surface in which the slopes of the indentations of the sinusoidal curves of the innermost and outermost circumferences of the bearing path correspond in slope to that of the sinusoidal curve in the center of the bearing path. In other words, a plane projected from the axis of the mainshaft to any outermost point on the cam will give cross sections showing the bearing contact area of the cam having the same thickness of cam at the innermost, center and outermost points. The rises and reverse rises will have thicker cam sections than the intermediate sections between rise and reverse rise but the thicknesses at a particular cross section will be uniform whether the cross section is at a rise, reverse rise or any intermediate position. As a bearing travels on such a sinusoidal cam surface, the same principle applies as to the circumferential distances traveled. Thus the path on the cam surface traveled by the innermost edge of the bearing is considerably shorter than the path on the cam surface traveled by the outermost edge of the bearing. Therefore, since each point on the straight line of contact points described above rotates the same distance for each revolution of the cylindrical bearing, the outer edge of the bearing must travel a greater circumferential distance than the innermost edge of the bearing thereby resulting in friction and binding between the bearing and the cam. In some of the prior art patents cited above, the bearings are designed in conical shape to compensate for these differences in circumferential distances that the outer and inner edges must travel. However this method of compensation produces vector forces giving an undesirable outward thrust to the connecting rods and to the pistons. At each of the rises and reverse rises of the cam of this invention the points of contact of the bearing with the cam comprise a straight line as described above. Between a rise and a reverse rise there needs to be a compensation for the greater distance that the outermost point of the bearing travels compared to the shorter distance that the innermost point of the bearing travels. In the cam of this invention, the centerline of the contact path between the bearing and the cam is referred to as the centerline sinusoidal curve. The intersection of this sinusoidal curve with the straight line of contact points of the bearing with the cam at the respective rises and reverse rises is consistent throughout the rotation of the bearing. However, between the rises and reverse rises, there needs to be an adjustment of the line of contact points on the cylindrical surface of the bearing.As the bearing moves away from a rise, there is a gradual variation in the line of contact points to spirals increasing gradually in variance from the straight line of contact so that as the bearing reaches the midpoint between the rise and reverse rise, the points of contact form its widest spiral line deviation on the surface of the cylindrical bearing with the outermost point on this spiral line being either right or left of a straight line on the cylindrical surface passing through the point of contact of the bearing with the center sinusoidal curve and the innermost point of the spiral of contact points is either left or right of said straight line. In other words, the outermost point and the innermost point are on opposite sides of this straight line.The factor determining whether the outermost point is to the right or left of said centerline is whether the bearing is moving up or down the rise, and whether the movement of the cam is clockwise or counterclockwise around the mainshaft. Then as the bearing moves from this midpoint between the rise and reverse rise, this spiral line of contact points gradually reverses direction until at the time the bearing reaches the reverse rise, the contact points have reverted to a straight line. As the bearing moves further going up from the r crse rise to the rise, another spiral contact line is formed with the positioning of the points being the reverse of where they were on the way down from the rise to the reverse rise.Again as the bearing passes the midpoint to the rise, the direction of contact points reverses so that gradually the spiral reverts to a straight line of contact points at the top of the rise. This variation of contact points from a straight line to a spiral and then back to a straight line compensates for the greater distance traveled by outermost points on the bearing as compared to innermost points on the bearing. This action is defined herein as ratio compensa tion . It is possible to calculate the cam surface design which will effect ratio compensation contact with the respective bearings. This can be done by translation of circular or crankshaft motion to straight line motion using distance or length D equivalent to the stroke or distance of travel of a piston. This method of calculation may be used for the outermost, center and innermost of the contact points on a bearing or any intermediate contact point. Generally the determination of the sinusoidal curves for the outermost and innermost contact points of a bearing with the cam are sufficient and intermediate contact points comprise a gradual transition from the outermost to the innermost points. The sinusoidal curve developed for the outermost contact points has a lesser slope between rise and reverse rise as compared to the sinusoidal curve for the innermost contact points. This difference permits the variations in contact at the innermost and outermost points as compared to each other and to the center points which effects ratio compensation so that between rises and reverse rises the contact points resemble a spiral on the cylindrical surface of the bearing but at the respective rises and reverse rises the contact points form a straight line on the cylindrical bearing parallel to the axis of the bearing. Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention In Fig. A the stroke of the piston is represented as distance D which is also the distance from point 0 to point 1800 on the circle. D also represents the diameter of the circle. Figs A is an enlarged version of Fig. A but isolated on the lines for C having traveled 100 on the circle. Fig. B is also isolated on the 100 arc and shows the distance X that point B has traveled on line F. Point C is identified as the point of contact of line b with the circle and point B the point of contact of piston rod R with the circle at zero position.As the wheel or circle is rotated on its center A, the point of contact C moves in a circular path and point B moves downward along the path of line F until when point C has traveled 1800 in its circular path, point B has traveled the distance D on its straight line path F. Points B and B show the intermediate positions of B at 900 and 1350 respectively. In having a bearing travel from one rise to an adjacent reverse rise such as from 0 to 900 , the piston travels a cycle or the stroke distance. Then with the bearing traveling to the next rise the piston has reversed to its original position and completed two cycles for one half revolution of the cam. Therefore there are two cycles of piston movement for each one half revolution of the cam and the piston travels 100 of its cycle for each 50 of cam revolution. In other words, a bearing covers 50 of the cam for each 100 by the piston. Therefore the distance x which is the vertical distance traveled in 100 of arc of travel will also be the vertical distance a bearing will move in contact with the cam surface through 50 of cam revolution.Likewise, in 200 and 300 of point C movement, the vertical distance moved by the bearing in contact with the cam will be y and z, respectively. For each 100 arc of travel or other convenient arc of the piston through its cycle, the distance for each position of C to the center A of the circle is the radius of the circle or D 2 and the distance from each position of C to the corresponding point of B on line F in each case is D or the stroke distance. The 100 and 200 positions are not shown according to scale but are exaggerated for clarity. In Fig. B, the 100 arc position is shown with the oblique triangle having D as its longest side, D 2 as its shortest side and the third side equal to D 2 plus the distance traveled by point B on line F of Fig.A. The obtuse angle in this triangle is 1800 10 or 1700. Knowing this angle and the lengths of two sides of the triangle, it is possible to calculate the length of the third side. The length of this third side of the triangle differs from D 2 by the distance that B has traveled on line F. This also corresponds to the vertical distance x that C has traveled in moving from 0 to 100 on its circular path. Likewise when C has moved in its circular path 200 and 300 respectively, the total vertical distances moved by C will be y and z, respectively. Correspondingly, B will have moved these same vertical distances respectively along the path of line F. Fig. C shows in exaggerated scale how the point of contact point B will travel vertically on a cam surface traveling 100, 200 and 300, respectively. The distances x, y, z, etc. shown in Figs. C and D also represent the vertical distance that the point C has moved from its original zero position for each of the specific angles or arcs of movement. These also represent the positions of the center of a bearing as it moves the respective arc distances on the sinusoidal cam. Fig. E represents a sinusoidal curve with HR representing the high rise positions and DRR representing the depth of the reverse rise positions. This is also a planar representation of a sinusoidal curve through 180 . Increments of 50 each are shown through the first 450. With 5 of the cam corresponding to 100 of a piston cycle, the corresponding values of x, y, z, etc. may be plotted to give a sinusoidal curve which corresponds to the sinusoidal path of the center of a bearing traveling on the sinusoidal surface of a cam of this invention. At the top of Fig. F a series of circles are drawn with the centers of each circle positioned on a horizontal line.The length of this horizontal line represents 1800 of travel on the cam and also represents one half the circumferential distance, in this case the outer circle of the cam or the contact points of the outer edge of a bearing with the upper cam surface. The positions of these circles are moved progressively 50 to the right for each 100 of movement of the piston which corresponds to 50 of movement on the cam.For each 100 of piston movement through its cycle, a diagram is drawn in accordance with that illustrated in Figs. A andB to show the triangles formed by points or angles A, B andC. At 0 for both the piston cycle and the cam revolution, the center of the circle for the piston is on a vertical line extending downward from the 0 point and for convenience, the center of the circle representing the center or axis of the bearing at the outer end or the end which is in contadt with the outer edge of the cam is positioned on this vertical line at a distance corresponding to line c which is the distance between points A and B. As the circles are moved progressively to the right on the horizontal line each successive 50 and the successive arcs for piston movement determined on each respective circle, the points C are determined and the point B center of bearing is moved down on the corresponding vertical line a distance equal to the vertical movement of C.In this manner a series of circles are drawn on the horizontal line and the positions of bearing centers are determined by drawing the respective triangles.A line drawn through these bearing center points form a sinusoidal curve and a series of circles are drawn on such sinusoidal curve, each circle having a radius corresponding to the radius of the cylindrical bearing. The contact point of each circle in this case the outer edge of the bearing with the cam is determined by drawing a triangle between three successive center points as shown in the enlarge exaggerated version shown in Fig. G where three successive center points are shown as B, B andB . The largest side of this triangle is the line between the 1st and 3rd points B and B and the two shorter sides are between the lst and 2nd points B and B and between the 2nd and 3rd points B and B . A line p is drawn from the 2nd point B , which is the center for the middle circle of the three, perpendicular to the longest side of the triangle from B to B and extended to the circle. The circle shown in Fig. G is that which has B as its center. The point of intersection of this line p with the circle is the point of contact of the bearing with the sinusoidal cam surface. This procedure is repeated progressively for each successive combination of three circles to determine the tangent or point of contact of the successive circles or positions of bearing with the cam surface. These points of contact determine the contour of the cam surface against which the bearing will come in contact. In the formation of the triangles described above, for determination of the centers of this second or lower series of circles for positioning a bearing . the side a runs from the end of a piston arc to the center of a corresponding circle in this second series of circles. An arc of travel on the cam circumference is indicated by the 5 , 100, 150, etc. degree markings at the respective vertical lines and the ends of arcs traveled in a piston cycle indicated by lines marked 100, 200, 300, etc. extending from the appropriate point on the corresponding circle. These respective points 100, 20 , 300, etc. represent point C in the respective triangles of Figs. A and B. The line a drawn from C to B is extended as shown by dotted line a . For the circles having piston arcs of 0 and 90 , there is no line a1 since it coincides with the vertical centerlines.However as the piston arcs increase from 100 through 900, the space between a dotted line a and the closest line used to determine the cam contact point increases progressively until a maximum space is reached at 450 where a is substituted for a . This maximum space means that the contact point of the outer circle of the bearing is at a maximum variant from where it is at 00. Then in progressing from piston cycle arcs of 450 to 900, the space defined between a and the contact determining line decreases gradually to where at 900 the dotted line a coincides with the vertical centerline. Although these a lines are not projected in each case through completion of the piston cycle, the space between the a line and the contact determining line p increases from 900 to maximum at 1350 and then decreases gradually from a maximum at 135 to zero space at 180 . This gradual increase in these spaces and then gradual decrease in these spaces represent the ratio compensation mentioned above. Below the above described second series of circles, there is shown in Fig. F a third series of circles which are similarly projected from a horizontal row of circles not shown which are positioned further below the third series of circles and are projections from the opposite piston joined by a connecting rod and acting in unison with the piston for which projections have been described above. The contact points of the second series of circles with the cam surface determine the contour of the upper surface of the cam at its outer edge and the contact points of the third series of circles with the cam surface determine the contour of the under surface of the cam at its outer edge. It will be noted that the cam is thickest at the 00, 900 and 1800 points of the cam and thinnest at the 459 and 1350 points. It will also be noted that the contact points for the circles or bearing positions at 450 on the cam are on opposite sides of the 450 vertical centerline. Since the space between two bearings on the same connecting rod remains constant, this means that the thickness of the cam at 450, 1350, 2150 and 3150 positions must be correspondingly thinner than the cam at its 00, 900, 1800 and 2700 positions. Fig. H shows similar series of circles developed as inFig. F except that these are for the inner edges of the respective bearings. The horizontal line of centers for the first or top series of circles is scaled for 1800 of the circular configuration of the cam taken at the contact points of the inner edge of the bearing with the cam surface.The second or middle series of circles is developed as inFig. F to determine the center points of the upper bearing at various progressive points in the bearing s travel at 50 increments over the cam with the contact points of the inner edge of this bearing on the cam surface determined in the manner described for Fig. F. Likewise, the third series of circles and the coiltact points of the lower bearing on the same connecting rod as for the said upper bearing are determined from a series of horizontally positioned circles not shown but also developed in the manner described as for Fig. F and the cam surface contact points developed as for Fig. F. It will be noted that the slopes of the sinusoidal curves of Fig. ll are much steeper than for the corresponding curves of Fig. F. This means that the curves from the rises to the reverse rises and vice versa are much steeper in this case. At the 450 point on the cam, the triangle is shown for sides a, b and c with the extension of line a shown as dotted line a . The line from the center of the corresponding circle in the second or middle series of circles to the contact point of that circle or inner bearing edge with the cam surface is also shown. It will be noted that the space or angle between a and the line determining this contact point is much greater than for the 450 position inFig. F. Although the lines for the respective circles are not drawn in Fig. H, they may be drawn to show progressive decrease in the space between the extension lines a not shown and the contact determining lines as the circles move away from the maximum space or angle at the 450 position until they reach the minimum of 0 at the 0 and 900 po3itións. The maximums are again reached at the 1350, 2250 and 3150 positions and the minimums or 0 again reached at 1800, 2700 and 3600 positions. As described above, this design of the surfaces of the cam of this invention permit full contact as each bearing travels on its circumferential path on the cam and by the spiraling contact described above and its ratio compensation for the inner and outer areas of the bearing as effected by the varying slopes of the sinusoidal surfaces of the cam, the bearings effect rotation of the cam and the mainshaft without the friction that accompanies the use of a sinusoidal cam that has identical slopes in the.inner and outer portions of the cam. In accordance with Fig. A, for an arc of 450 angle A is equal to l800 450 or 1350. For a stroke of 1.900 inches, line a of Fig. A has a length of .1.900 and b D 2 or 0.950. Using the equation Sine B b Sine A a or Sine B 0.950 Sine 1350 1.9 Sine B Sine 1350 x 2 angle B is determined, and angle C is determined as equal to 180 the sum of anglesA and B. Distance C is determined by the formula c a sineC sine A or c l.9 sine C sine 1350. The length of travel of the piston from the top dead center point T.D.C. to the 450 angle is equal to the difference between c and the radius or c 0.950. As discussed above with regard to Fig. A, the maximum piston travel distance is identified as D which, in this case, is also the diameter of the circle traveled by pointC. The contact point of the bearing with the cam face may be calculated for the various arcs of travel of point C as described below in connection with Figs. L R. In Fig. A, the 0 point is the top dead center point T.D.C. and the 1800 point is the bottom dead center point B.D.C. of the piston stroke or the connection point of the connecting rod with the bearing center. The intermediate positions of this connecting point or bearing center are determined as described for Figs. F and H. With the bearing center remaining on the centerline of the piston and of the connecting rod, the bearing rises and falls with the upward and downward movement of the piston and connecting rod.This upward and downward movement of the bearing causes pressure on the cam surface resulting in rotation of the cam. To determine the actual contact points of the bearing with the cam surface a number of calculations may be made as described for the determination of line p in Figs. F and G.This is also illustrated below in Figs. M, N, P, Q andR. Figs. I, J and K illustrate the determination of the location for points A, B and C and the resultant triangles for angles 450, 900 and 1350. Fig. I shows by dotted lines variations in the respective triangles for 5D less and greater than the 450, namely 400 and 500, as developed more fully below in connection with Figs. L, M and N. In Fig. L, a bearing L is shown superimposed on cam J.While the bearing actually remains in the same position except to move up and down vertically, and the cam rotates below or above a particular bearing, this is a matter of relativity and the bearing is depicted here at a 450 angle on the cam. Radial dotted lines are shown for 400, 450 and 500. The outer edge of the bearing is identified as 0, the midpoint of the bearing cylindrical surface as M and the inner edge of the bearing as I. The intercept points of the radial lines for 40 , 450 and 500 are identified as O , O and O respectively. The vertical distance between 0 andO is identified as x and that between 0 and 0 as x .The x and x distances also represent distances on the vertical line between 0 and 1800 of Fig. A that the center of the bearing will travel when the piston and connecting rod connecting point to the bearing has traveled from 400 to 450 and 45 to 500 of the stroke distance. Since the lengths of these 5 arcs are relatively short, they are approximately equal to a straight line between the respective points. The arc distances may be calculated as 5 360 or 1 72 of the appropriate circumference which is 2nR where R is the radius of the respective circles for the line of contact of the outer edge middle and inner edge respectively of the bearing with the cam surface.While the cam surface is actually sinusoidal, the circle referred to is considered as one produced by having the contact point of the bearing rotate on a flat surface with the center of rotation being the axis of the cam or the cam shaft. It may also be considered as the outer surface of a cylinder on which the contact points of the particular part of the bearing with the cam surface will be included. Fig. M shows the various distances that the center of a bearing travels on the vertical 450 line from 0 to the full stroke at 1800 including the various intermediate distances at 400, 450 and 500. The vertical distances between the 400 and 450 points and between the 450 and 500 points are identified as x and x as also described above.The overall vertical distance from 0 to 400 is identified as y from 0 to 450 as y and from 0 to 500 as y . A triangle is defined in the center of Fig. M by the horizontal 400 line running from the 400 vertical line to the 500 vertical line a vertical section on the 500 vertical line running from the 400 horizontal line to the 500 horizontal line and the hypotenus connects the two unattached ends of the said horizontal and vertical sides. A line is drawn perpendicular to this hypotenus at its intersection with the vertical 450 line.This perpendicular line forms an angle P with the said vertical 450 line anti this angle corresponds to the angle P formed between the horizontal 400 line and the said hypotenus. This same triangle is shown in enlarged form in Fig N. In Fig. N the length of line 0 and on is the 50 arc length of Figs. L and M and the length of line 0 0 is also a 50 arc length so that triangle side 0 O is twice the 50 arc length. The vertical side of the triangle is equal to x plus x1,. Therefore the value of angle P is determined from the equation Tangent of P x twice the 50 arc length Thus, where the stroke or a value is 1.900 inches, the radius or b value is .950, the bearing has a width of 0.5 inch and the radius from the center of the cam to the outer edge of the bearing is 3.5 inches, the respective 50 arc lengths are calculated to be .1525 at the contact line for the outer edge of the bearing, .1416 at the contact line for the middle of the bearing and .1307 at the contact line for the inner edge of the bearing. The angle P is 130 04 16 for the outside, 140 05 02 for the middle and 150 16 26 for the inside, with x x value being 0.71 inch in each case. This determination of angle P makes it possible to determine also the contact points of the bearing with the cam surface. Thus in Figs. P, Q and R, the points of contact are identified as X, Y and Z respectively for the outside edge of the bearing, the middle of the bearing and the inner edge of the bearing. Using the respective different circumferences for these outside, middle and inner circles, it is possible as described above to determine the value of angleP in each case, and then the distances for X, Y and Z from the 450 line as shown in Figs. P, n and R. Thus, as shown in Figs. P, Q and R, the contact points of the bearing are .170 inch from the 450 line for X the outer edge of the bearing , inch for Y the middle of the bearing and .198 inch for Z the inner edge of the bearing.These differences or variances in the distance of these various contact points from the 450 line confirm the fact the contact points on the bearing surface form a spiral line at the 450 point of the cam as compared to the straight line contact effected at the 00, 900, 1800, 2700 and 3600 points of the cam. Between the maximum variance at the 450, 1350, 2250 and 3150 points and the adjacent straight line of contact points there is a gradual change from one to the other and the exact contact points for various angles of the cam may be calculated as described above. The ratio .198 .170 or 1.1655 1 is the compensation that must be accommodated between the outer and inner edges of the bearing because of the differences in respective circle circumferences that the outer and inner edges must travel in its travel over the sinusoidal cam or the sinusoidal cam under or over the bearing . This ratio compensation is effected by the type of cam surface described herein. This same ratio may be calculated from the respective circumferences, namely 21.966 18.824 or 1.1655 1. In order to design an appropriate cam lobe it is neces ary to have certain information or dimensions predetermined, such as the diameter of the bearings to be used on the cam lobe, the stroke of the piston or the distance through which the bearings will be pushed by the piston and possibly the thickness of the cam lobe at the rise or reverse rise of the lobe. The thickness of the cam lobe at this point should be limited substantially to the distance between the closest points of the two bearings that are in contact with the cam lobe and at opposite sides of the cam lobe, with a minimum amount allowed for clearance. Obviously the farther the contact points are from the axis of the mainshaft, the greater will be the leverage for turning the mainshaft. Since the cam lobe needs to be only wide enough to permit contact of the bearings with it, the cam drum may be big enough to occupy most of the space between the mainshaft and the bearing contact area on the cam lobe. A primary requirement is that there is always one bearing of a pair in contact with one of the cam lobe surfaces. The other bearing of the pair may be in contact with the opposite cam lobe surface but preferably may have a clearance of about 0.002 inch or more. When there is a variation from the ideal design described above there may be considerably less thickness in the cam lobe between rise and reverse rise, in which case there will be more clearance of the second bearing during its non contacting movement. When the two opposing bearings reach a rise or a reverse rise, there will be a changeover in the contact of the bearings. For example, the bearing in contact with the lobe surface as it moves down from the top of the rise to the dip or reverse rise after passing the thickest part of the lobe becomes the bearing out of contact with the lobe surface, depending on the clearance, and the other bearing becomes the one in contact with the lobe surface until the next rise is reached. While it is preferred that there is at least about 0.002 inch clearance for the non contacting bearing, it is possible with an ideally designed lobe that both bearings are in contact with the adjacent lobe surfaces allowing for lubricant and operating engine heat expansion. As indicated above, the engine of this invention may be designed for 4 cycle operation with 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16 or more cylinders to give smoother and more efficient operation than with conventional engines. In 4 cycle operation the firing exhaust, intake and compression are performed on separate strokes. In 2 cycle operation, the firing and exhaust are performed on one stroke, and the intake and compression are performed with a second stroke. With 2cycle operation, the engine of this invention may be designed with 1, 2, 4 or more cylinders, that is, with two pairs of opposing cylinders and pistons. Such small engines may be used on motorcycles, bikes, etc. It is also possible to adapt the engine of this invention with certain modifications for use as a compressor.Thus if an external power source is used to drive the mainshaft, air or other gas may be taken into the cylinders, compressed and exhausted under pressure. If desired, two engines of this type may be joined on the same mainshaft with one engine providing the power to drive the mainshaft and the other to perform as a compressor. Moreover, an engine of this invention may be used to drive the shaft of a generator to provide electrical current. In using one engine of this type as a compressor and another of these engines to deliver power to the compressor, the two mainshafts of these engines would be coupled with a clutch or another type of power source may be used to drive the mainshaft of the compressor engine. Poppet valves, spring operated or otherwise, may be used to delivery com pressed air to the receiving line or reservoir. In Fig. 1, mainshaft 1 has attached to it cam drum 2 and to this cam drum 2 there is attached the cam lobe 3 with the cam lobe having a high rise shown as 3 and a lbw section or opposite high rise shown as 3 . Cam lobe 3 has the sinusoidal surfaces described above. pistons PA and PA in cylinders A and A , respectively, are connected by connecting rod 4 and 5 which has attached bearing 6 which rotates on axle 7 and is made freely rotatable by ball bearings 8. Cam drum 2 has tapered circular ridges 9 and 9 on both of its plates 10 and 10 with periodic rises in these ridges.Grooved wheels 11 and 11 are part of the valve lifter and these ride on the ridges and are connected to push rods 12 and 12 . Push rods 12 and 12 press against and actuate rocker arms 13 and 13 . The rocker arms are supported by rods 14 and 14 which are screwed into the cylinder head 15.When a rise in ridge 9 or 9 hits and pushes wheel 11 or 11 outward, this movement also moves push rod 12 or 12 outward against rocker arm 13 or 13 . Outward movement of rocker arm or 13 pushes its opposite arm 16 or 16 inward thereby opening valve 17 or 17 to allow passage through the intake valve opening. Ridges 9 have the rises therein located in a position so that the opening movement of valve 17 is activated at the appropriate time for feeding fuel from opening 18 through the valve opening when intake valve 17 is in the opened position. The rise 9 is of sufficient length to hold the valve 17 in open position for the appropriate length of time in accordance with the operating cycle of the corresponding piston and cylinder. When the rise is terminated the valve is returned to its closed position by spring 19. Ridges 9 have the rise therein positioned so that the opening movement of valve 17 is actuated at the appropriate time for exhuasting gases from the cylinder through exhaust opening 18 . Again the lengths of the rise in ridge 9 is sufficient to keep the exhaust valve open for the appropriate time. When the rise is terminated the valve is returned to its closed position by spring 19 . The engine block is preferably assembled from three separate castings 15, 15 and 15 and is extended into and supported by mounts 20. Cylinder blocks 31 and heads 15 may be individually fastened or bolted onto the engine block. Fig. 2 shows rocker cover 21 broken away and sections below shown for various inner level operations involving cylinders D, E, F and G. Cylinders A, B, C and H are hidden by the rocker cover but their relative positions are shown by dotted circles. Mainshaft 1 is shown in cross section.The broken section of the rocker cover above cylinder D shows cam lobe 3, cylinder head 15, cam drum 2, ridges 9 and 9 , intake lifter wheel 11, exhaust lifter wheel 11 , connecting rod 5 and roller bearing 6. Piston PE is shown in cylinderE and the exhaust push rod 12 and intake push rod 12 operating therewith. The section showing the positioning of cylinder F has the rocker arms removed and shows sparkplug 22, intake valve 17, exhaust valve 17 , intake port, and exhaust port 18 .With cylinder G there are shown rocker arm shafts 14 and 14 and the forward portions of rocker arms 16 and 16 . Figs. 3 and 4 show top and side elevational views respectively of cam drum 2 and cam lobe 3 with ridges 9 in the top and bottom surfaces of the cam plate and the high rise 3 and reverse rise 3 of cam lobe 3. In the cross sectional view shown of a portion of cam drum 2, a rise in ridge 9 is shown to push lifter wheel 11 and push rod 12 upward thereby effecting opening of the intake valve not shown . At this position ridge 9 is at its normal level so that lifter wheel 11 and push rod 12 have not activated the corresponding valve so that the exhaust valve is in a closed position. The schematic layout of Fig. 5 shows tha relative positions of the various pistons at a particular instant.In this arrangement pistons A and R are at the top or crest of cam lobe rise 3 and pistons C and G are at the top or crest of reverse cam lobe rise 3 . Each of these pistons is in a position for firing and as movement carries the bearings 6 off dead center of the cam lobe rises, the movement of the pistons, the connecting rods and the attached bearings will exert force against the cam lobe and thereby cause rotation of the mainshaft. It will be noted that two cylinders are firing simultaneously, namely A and G . At the same instant, cylindersB and H are halfway through the firing cycle. Cylinders C and A have completed their firing cycles and are ready to start their exhaust cycle, and cylinders E and C have finished their exhaust cycle and are ready to start the intake cycle, cylinders G and E have finished their intake cycle and are ready to start the compression cycle. CylindersH and B are halfway through their compression cycles. Fig. 7a shows the bearing 6 for piston PA positioned at the top of cam lobe rise 3 just off dead center and ready to start downward thereby exerting force on the cam lobe which will cause mainshaft 1 to rotate. Bearing 6 is under the cam lobe and has just completed its firing cycle travel for piston PA and is starting its exhaust cycJe. Pi. 7b shows bearing 6 and bearing 6 halfway down their paths with the cam lobe and mainshaft rotated part way. Fig. 7c shows the cam lobe andimainshaft rotated still farther and bearing 6 in its position at the end of the firing cycle for pistonPA and bearing 6 is in its final position for exhaust of cylinder A . Fig. 7d shows bearing 6 starting its exhaust movement upward on the cam lobe and bearing 6 is also starting upward in its intake movement for cylinder A .Fig. 7e shows bearing 6 and bearing 6 halfway in their upward movement for exhausting cylinder A and intake for cylinder A respectively. Fig. 7f shows bearing 6 at the top of the opposite rise 3 for completing the exhaust movement of cylinder A and bearing 6 at the top of its intake cycle for completing the intake movement of cylinder A .Figs. 7a through Fig. 7f show the movement of bearings 6 and 6 for one half revolution of the mainshaft. In subsequent movements not shown , bearing 6 goes through positions for intake and compression of cylinder A taking bearing 6 back to the position of 7a for completion of the cycle and one complete revolution of the mainshaft. In subsequent movements not shown of bearing 6 , it goes through the compression and firing cycles of cylinder A taking it also back to the position shown in Fig. 7a. While the drawings described above are directed to 8 pairs or 16 individual pistons and cylinders, the engine of this invention may also be operated with lower or higher numbers of pistons and cylinders. For example, four or six pairs may be used as well as ten or twelve pairs or even higher with appropriate arrangement and timing to effect smooth and efficient operation. Figs. 8a through 8i reyllesent cross sections of the bearing contact areas of the cam of this invention taken by planes each coinciding with the centerline of the mainshaft and taken at angles of 0 , 22.50, 450, 67.50, 900, 112.50, 1350, 157.5 and 1800 respectively. As shown in the respective trapezoids of Figs. 8a through Fig. 8e, the cam portions gradually decrease in thickness from 0 to 450 and then increase gradually from 450 to 900 where the thickness reaches the same as for 00.Similar decrease to 1350 and then increase to 1800 are shown in Figs. 8f to 8i. Moreover, as the transition goes from 0 to 450, the right side of the respective trapezoids, which right sides are represented by dotted lines since this side is the only side not an outer configuration of the cam lobe but actually extends into the cam. The end points of this dotted line are on the contact line of the inner edges of the bearings in contact with the cam lobe. These decrease in size at a greater rate than the left sides of the respective trapezoids, which left sides represent the outer circumference of the cam lobe and the extremities of the left side line represent the line contacted by the outer edge of the bearings.The dimensions given onFigs. 8a through 8i are actually dimensions for a cam lobe having a radius of 3.246 inches from the centerline of the bearing path which also corresponds to the centerline of the piston or connecting rod to the axis of the cam as well as axis of the mainshaft . The centerline circumference is 20.985 and the outer and inner circumferences are 21.966 and 18.824 respectively. The bearing used has n 1 inch diameter and 0.5 inch width. The rectangular configurations of Figs. Ba, Be and 8i represent the thickness of the contact bearing portions of the cam taken at 00, 900, 2700 and 3600 or in other words, at the respective rises and reverse rises of the cam of this invention. The respective intermediate trapezoidal configurations of Figs. 8b, 8c, 8d, 8f, 8g and 8h result from the steeper slope of the sinusoidal curve in contact with the inner edge of a bearing as compared to the lesser slope of the sinusoidal curve in contact with the outer edge of the bearing.The dimensions of the varius lines shown in Figs. 8a through 8i are calculated and the accuracy of these measurements is confirmed by cutting the cam in the planes indicated and measuring the respective dimensions. Figs. 9a through 9i show cross sections at the areas corresponding to those of Figs. Ba through 8i taken on a cam having sinusoidal surfaces of the type known in the prior art which do not have the ratio compensation feature of the present invention. In this series all of the cross sections created by the respective planes used as Figs. 8 through 8i at angles of 00, 22.50, 450, etc. are rectangles with the right sides in each case having the same dimension as the left side. While the thickness of these sections decrease from 0 to a minimum at 450 and increase from the minimum at 450 to a maximum at 900, the dimensions for the two sides are the same in the cross section for a particular angle. These shapes and dimensions are consistent with the fact that the slopes of the sinusoidal surfaces are the same at the contact points of these surfaces with the inner and outer edges of the bearings. Fig. 10 shows a modification in which the engine of this invention has been adapted to serve as a compressor.The various elements are as described above except that cylinder head 15 and various fittings and attachments are replaced by clylinder head 38 which has threaded openings into which intake valve 36 and outlet valve 37 are fitted so as to connect with the interior of cylinder A or A . Mainshaft 1 is driven as described below, while rotatably supported on bearings 41, whereupon cam lobe 2 is rotated and thereby the sinusoidal surfaces press against the bearings 6. This produces a forward and backward motion of connecting rods 4 and 5 and therewith movement of pistons PA and PA . Such movement of the pistons draws air or other gas into inlet valves 36 and then upon reversal of direction of the piston intake valve 36 closes and air under compression is forced out of outlet valve 37.Springs 39 serve to keep valves 36 and 37 closed until sufficient differential pressure is applied to open the respective valves In operating this engine as a compressor, either some or all of the cylinders may be equipped or designed as shown in Fig. 10. If all of the cylinders are so operated, then an external or separate driving force may be used to rotate the mainshaft 1. In such case another engine such as shown in the earlier figures may be used to drive the mainshaft or another type of internal combustion engine, electric motor, etc. may be used for this purpose. Another alternative is to have some of the cylinders equipped to operate as a power engine as described above and the remaining cylinders equipped and operated to serve as a compressor. In such case, the two pistons attached to a particular piston rod can both serve the same function, namely either to supply driving force to the mainshaft or to serve as a compressor, or one can serve to deliver driving force while the other functions as a compressor. In either case, the pistons serving one function are staggered with those serving the other function so as to supply an even, uniform compressive force. vv IY do Fig. 11 shows a design in which the sinusoidal surfaces are the side surfaces of a groove 40 cut into the annular surface of the ca, lohe as shown in Fig. 12.In such cases the surfaces against which the bearing is in contact is shaped similarly to those dcscribccl above so that there is ratio compensation for the travel paths of the outer and inner edges of the bearings. In Fig. 11 there is only one bearing 6 attached to each piston rod in contrast to the two shown in Figs. 1 and 10.Moreover, the width of the groove is at least substantially equal to the diameter of this bearing with a small tolerance to allow rotation of the bearing while in contact with only one of the sinusoidal surfaces during a particular period.Connecting rod in Fig. 11 has a narrow midsection 4 to acco.nno date cam drum 2 extending thereinto to a position where the centerline of the pistons PA and PA coincides with the midpoint of bearing 6. The axis of the bearing is at a 900 angle with the centerline of the piston. This arrangement provides centerline thrust between the bearing and the cam surface thereby avoiding any sideward vector thrust and any tendency to give a sideward thrust to the pistons. The operation of the engine with the groove shown inFigs. 11 and 12, either to deliver power or to produce gas compression, is substantially the same as described above with respect to the design in which the sinusoidal surfaces are outer surfaces of the cam lobe. In both cases, however, the cam lobe surfaces with which the bearing or bearings are in contact are at a substantial distance from the linear axis of the mainshaft as compared with the distance from r this l near axis to the annular surface of the mainshaft.The ratio of these distances is at least 2 1, and preferably at least 3 1. A particular advantage of the engine of this invention i the silicity of engine anufture and assembly. For example, the engine block may be assembled from three separate castings 15 , 1i and l5 bolted together and the individual cylinder heads 15 may be e bo ed onto the engine block. This bolting arrangement of the engine block and the cylinder heats facilitates and makes less expensive the manufacture, assembly and repair ot the orlyine or any part of it. Moreover, cast aluminup.. may be used for the engine block, cylinder heads and pistons, thereby contributing to a considerable decrease in weight. These factors, together with the smaller size, gives a tremendous advantage in weight compared to conventional enqines. For example, an 8cylinder engine of this new design will weigh approximately one fourth less than a standard conventional engine of equivalent power output. with an engine of this new design having 16 cylnnders, the displacement will be doubled, giving only a 20 increase in size and weight with about a 100 increase in power .output compared with a corresponding 8 cylinder engine. In a 402 cubic inch V 8 conventional engine, the bore is 4.00 and the stroke is 4.00 which equals 2.00 of leverage from the center line of the crankshaft to the center line of the connecting rod. This gives 6.283 travel at 1800 revolution of the crankshaft. The V 8 engine has a 2 1 ratio crankshaft to cam shaft. One revolution of the crankshaft completes two cycles which means four cylinders fire per revolution. Thus the crankshaft uses 1800 of rotation with 4.00 of stroke each cycle and 2.00 of leverage In contrast, a piston engine of this new design having a 4.00 bore and 4.00 stroke has 5.55 of leverage or 5.55 2 or 2.775 times that of the lT 8 enqine. By combining the leverage and distance factors, the rotary engine has 2.775 x 2.755 or 7.645 1 advantage over the V 8 engine. It is estimated that a 400 cubic inch displacement engine of this new design will give greatly improved mileage in compatlson to that presently obtained by conventional 400 cubic inch displacement enqines. Therefore this new engine has a vast impruvement in ecollollly and power compared to corresponding displacement in conventional automobile engines. While the arrangement of the cam drum with respect to the cam lobe and the mainshaft as shown in the drawings and as described above is preferred and is considered more practical and efficient, it is also contemplated that the cam drum may be omitted from its intermediate position between the mainshaft and the cam lobe. If desired, one or more cam drums may be attached to the mainshaft in a different location to provide harmonic balance and to provide support for the cam plates to be attached to the ends thereof, on which cam plates the ridge risers may be located for actuating the valve lifters for the intake and exhaust operations.Moreover, it is contemplated that the cam plates on which the said valve lifter actuating ridge risers are located may be plates or discs separated from the cam drum but still concentric with and attached to the mainshaft. Furthermore, the cam plates may actually be discs bolted, welded or otherwise fastened to the ends of the cam drum thereby facilitating flexibility in the design, replacement and location of the valve lifter ridge risers. Nevertheless the design shown in the drawings whereby the cam drum is intermediate between the cam lobe and the mainshaft is preferred since this location requires less space on the mainshaft and provides flywheel action and harmonic balance. Moreover, the cam drum may be solid or partially hollow in accordance with its size and, its desired effect. Also, in the modification shown in Fig. 11, the shaft supporting bearing 6 is preferably extended to support a counter rotation bearing not shown to prevent twisting. This collnter rotation hearinfi will fit in a groove running parallel to the axis of piston Iod 4, 5. The cam described herein with specially designed sinusoidal surfaces of the cam lobe is considered to be novel per se. Prior art methods of making cams are similar to the method described in Machinery s Handbook , pp. 631 637, 15th edition, published by The Industrial Press, New York, N.Y.There is no teaching in the prior art of the ratio compensation features described herein. There are described above methods for determining the exact shape or slope of the sinusoidal curves in varlou aring contact areas of cam or cam lobes. There have also now been found a simple process and apparatus for producing cams having cam lobes with the sinusoidal surfaces having the ratio compensation features described above. The process and apparatus are based on the fact that a cutting tool or grinder having the same radius as the bearing to be used on such surfaces will act in the same manner with respect to straight line and spiral line contacts with corresponding variances, and will therefore cut the sinusoidal surfaces correspondingly. In this process and apparatus a cutting tool or grinding wheel is selected having the same radius as the bearing which will be used against the cam surface. The cutting or grinding tool is held in a stationary position, for example vertically, while being rotated and a cylindrical cam is advanced toward and retracted from the cutting or grinding tool while the cam is rotated on its axis which is positioned horizontally or at a 900angle with the axis of the cutting or grinding tool. The rotation of the cam is correlated with the advancement of the cam toward the cutting or grinding tool so that the advancement and retraction will each occur twice during one revolution of the cam. The qradual advancement and then retraction of the cam with respect to the cutting tool or the grinding tool eventually results in a smooth cutting of two reverse rises into the end of the cam. The apparatus holding the cam and the mechanism causing its rotation as well as its advancement and retraction are all positioned Oll n nupportlng structure that can be moved manually or mechanically in a horizontal direction, for example, by a threaded device., Since the cutting or grinding should be effected gradually, the movement of the supporting structure is effected gradually to accommodate the depth of each cut. Moreover the total sideward movement of the cam during its rotation corresponds to the depth of the reverse rise to be cut into the cam.At the sites of the two rises the cam is fully retracted so that there is little or no cutting at these exact positions. Then at the positions of the reverse rises the advancement is at its maximum. Therefore initially the position of the supporting .structure is such that the maximum advancement of the cam toward the cutting tool causes a small cutting at the reverse rise positions that will accommodate the capacity of the cutting tool. Then periodically the supporting structure is advanced incrementally in the direction of the cutting tool so that new cuts of the appropriate depth are made. Therefore as these incremental advancements are made the cutting at the reverse rise positions become deeper and deeper with corresponding increases in depth being made between the reverse rise and the adjacent rises. When the appropriate depth has been effected in the reverse rises the cam may be reversed and positioned for cutting on the opposite side of the lobe with the reverse rises on this new side being registered directly opposite the rises on the first side or the cutting tool may be repositioned to the opposite side of the cam. Then the foregoing procedure is repeated to complete formation of the opposite sinusoidal curve. The distance between a rise on one side and the opposite reverse rise should correspond to the distance between bearings on a particular connecting rod plus a small amount, such as 0.002 to allow for clearance. To save a considerable amount of cutting or grinding it is convenient to use a model, even one made of wood, and preferably made by the above techniques, to form a mold from which castings of the desired metal may be made. Then cutting or grinding may be effected on such a preformed casting to give the exact dimensions and shape desired. In the top view shown in Fig. 13 and the side elevational view of Fig. 14, cutting tool 43 is actuated and supported by arm 44 extending downward from the driving machine not shown . The cutting tool 43 is supported from above and positioned to the left in this modification and also as shown in Fig. 14 of cam 46 on which cam lobe 47 is being cut. Cam 46 is supported by and rotated with tightly fitting shaft 48. Shaft 48 passes through an axial opening in the cam 46 and extends from housing 49 and identified on the other side as shaft 48 which is rotatably supported by supporting frame 45 through which shaft 48 is free to move horizontally in the same direction as cam 46..Inside housing 49 there are a series of gears 50, 50 and 50 which impart the desired rate of rotation to shaft 48 and thereby to cam 46 and cam lobe 47. Axle 51 drives the gear 50 which by appropriate gear ratios to gears 50 and 50 impart the desired rate of rotation. Shaft 51 is driven by gear 52 which in turn is driven by gear 53. Gear 53 is driven by electric motor 54 through pulley 55 and pulley wheels 56 and 57. The gear ratio between gears 53 and 52 are appropriate to translate the motor speed to the desired rate of rotation for gears 50, 50 and 50 . Shaft 51 has gear wheel 58 rigidly fixed to wheel 60. Wheel 60 has a pin 61 extending therefrom to engage arm 62 which in turn is pivotally affixed to shaft 48 by pivotal connector 64 so that as wheel 60 is rotated, pin 61 effects a forward and backward motion of arm 62 and thereby through the ball joint 63 transmits forward and backward motion to shaft 48. Shaft 48 extends slidably through gear wheel 50 and by a spline arrangement is rotated thereby.Shaft 48 extends through an axial opening in cam 46 and by a tight fit effects a corresponding movement therewith to the left and then backward to the right. This backward and forward movement corresponds to the diameter of the circle described by pin 61 on wheel 60. The ratios of the various gears are such that there are two revolutions of wheel 60 per revolution of cam 46 and cam lobe 47. As shown in Fig. 14, all of the above apparati except for the cutting tool 43 and its driving and supporting mechanism is supported by plate 65 slidably mounted on base 66 which is supported by legs which are not shown . Plate 65 is capable of being advanced to the left and retracted by an interior screw device not shown which is actuated by turning either handle 67 or handle 68 in the appropriate clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Fig. 15 is a cut away section of a portion of,Fig. 14 showing the arrangement of gear wheel 58 which drives gear wheel 59 on top of which is wheel 60. Wheel 60 has a pin 61 extending upward and fitted into an opening of arm 62 so that arm 62 is driven to the left and then retracted to the right as the wheel 60 is rotated. As shown in Fig. 14, the forward and backward movement of arm 62 causes a forward and backward movement of arm 48 to which it is connected by pivotal connection 64. As shown in Fig. 16, which is a cross sectional view taken at line 16 16 of Fig. 14, shaft 48 is slidably mounted as a spline shaft through a spline driving gear in the interior of gear wheel 50 so that it will be rotated by rotation of gear wheel 50 simultaneously with its forward movement to the left and its backward movement to the right as effected by corresponding movement of rod 62. Splines 69 on rod 48 insure rotation of rod 48 with rotation of wheel 50. This rotation of shaft 48 effects the rotation of cam 46 and cam lobe 47. As previously indicated, the respective gears are selected of appropriate size to give exactly two revolutions of gear wheel 59 and attached wheel 60 per each revolution of gear wheel 50 and cam 46 and cam lobe 47.In this way the cam lobe has been advanced twice per revolution to form the reverse rises and has been twice retracted per revolution to form the rises. While other gear arrangements may be utilized for this purpose, it is essential that this ratio of two revolutions of the wheel causing sideward movement of the cam and cam lobe per revolution of the cam and cam lobe on their axis is essential for the production of a cam lobe having two rises and two reverse rises. Moreover where it is desired to produce a. cam lobe having one rise and one reverse rise the gear arrangement is such as to effect one forward and backward movement of the cam and cam lobe per revolution thereof. Where it is desired to have three rises and three reverse rises per cam lobe, it will require gear wheel arrangements to give three forward and three backward movements per revolution of the cam lobe. Furthermore, while gear wheels are preferred for effecting the movements described, other equivalent means for effecting appropriate numbers of sideward movements per revolution of the cam lobe may be used. Fig. 17 shows how both sides of the cam lobe are cut or ground. While it is preferred to cut one side of the lobe at a time, it is possible by proper adjustments and spacing to cut or grind both sides simultaneously. However in Fig. 17, cutter 43 is shown positioned to cut the first side of cam lobe 47 and later after this first side is finished, the cutting tool will be changed to one cutting in the reverse direction and positioned on the opposite side of the lobe with the sideward movements of the lobe adjusted and registered appropriately. Where it is desired to cut a groove in the cam as shown inFigs. 11 and 12, wherein the sinusoidal surfaces are the sidewalls of the groove, the cutting tool 43 shown in Figs. 13 and 14 is raised and positioned above an uncut cylindrical cam. For this purpose the cutting tool has cutting edges on the bottom as well as on its side cylindrical surface. The cutting tool is then incrementally lowered about 1 16 of an inch per one or more revolutions of the cam, or any other incremental distance which is within the cutting capacity of the tool. As the cylindrical cam oscillates in accordance with the advancement and retraction described above, the groove is gradually cut into the cam simultaneously increasing the depth and cutting the sidewalls to provide sidewalls having the sinusoidal surfaces described above.In each sidewall the sinusoidal surface at the outer edge of the cylinder has a lesser slope than at depths farther into the cylinder toward the axis of the cylinder with the slope increasing gradually until the greatest slope is at the innermost part of the groove. The cutting tool has a diameter equal to the bearing which is to be used in the groove as illustrated in Fig. 11. Preferably a small clearance such as about .003 inch, is provided to allow for lubrication and clearance. where Moreover, it is desired to alter the face of the cam to change or vary performance of the cam, such as for high revolutions per minute, an eccentric device may be added to wheel 60 and connector 61 to alter the waveform of the cam lobe surface. However, for use in the engine herein described, the cam lobe described above is preferred. While certain features of this invention have been described in detail with respect to various embodiments thereof, it will of course be apparent that other modifications can be made within the spirit and scope of this invention, and it is not intended to limit the invention to the exact details shown above except insofar as they are defined in the following claims.
