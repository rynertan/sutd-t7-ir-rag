# Method of and means for controlling operation of electric devices.

## Abstract
Two or more electric devices 10,20 such as motors of a lift truck are powered by a common battery, each being actu ated by a separate SCR chopper circuit 12, 22 . An anti coincidence circuit 30 senses an on actuation control signal to a SCR chopper circuit 12 of the lift truck drive motor 10 and inhibits any off actuation control signal to a SCR chopper circuit 22 of the lift pump motor 20 for a few hundred microseconds before and a few hundred mic roseconds after the drive motor circuit 12 is actuated, to allow the battery to return to at least full open circuit voltage before the pump motor circuit 22 is turned off.
