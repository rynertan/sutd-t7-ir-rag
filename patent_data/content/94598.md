# Solar ray collection apparatus.

## Abstract
A solar ray collection apparatus 10 includes a plurality of lenses 12 mounted on at least one of opposite surfaces of a lens mount 14 . A plurality of light conducting members equal in number to the lenses are carried by a conductor mount which is held integral with and spaced from the lens mount by spacers and a frame, so that the focal point of each lens may coincide with the adjacent end of its associated light conductor. The lenses, lens mount, conductor mount, spacers and frame are made of materials the coefficient of expansion of which are equal to or substantially equal to each other, thereby overcoming the influence of the solar heat. Positioning means may be employed which moves the end of each light conducting member into alignment with the center of the adjacent lens, and then to the focal point of the lens and then fixes it in position. Stray beams in the apparatus may be converted into electrical energy at a suitable position or positions in the apparatus.
