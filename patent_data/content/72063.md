## Abstract
A triple row coax cable connector 10 providing a pluggable interface between a printed circuit board and a pair of coaxial cables. Signal wires 12 connect to a terminal 32 within the connector 10 after their poly tetrafluorethylene jackets 58 are pushed back by a funnel shaped member 22 . Drain wires 14 are soldered to strain relief bars 40, 42 projecting through holes 21 in a metal plate 20 separating the funnel shaped members 22 .
