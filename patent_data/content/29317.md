# Production of maleic anhydride.

## Abstract
Maleic anhydride is produced by oxidising a straight chain C₄ hydrocarbon with oxygen in a stream comprising 25 to 60 by volume of the C₄ hydrocarbon, 20 to 45 by volume of oxy gen and optionally inert gases to produce a stream containing at least 2¹ ₂ by volume of maleic anhydride and condensing maleic anhydride substantially free from water from this stream.
