## Description
PROCESS FOR REMOVING NITROGEN OXIDES FROM A GAS STREAM The present invention is directed toward a process for the conversion of common oxides of nitrogen such as nitrogen oxide, nitrogen dioxide and nitrous oxide to nitrogen gas. These oxides of nitrogen arise from various sources such as stack gases, exhaust from internal combustion engines and the decomposition of nitric acid.Whereas existing processes for the conversion of nitrogen oxides have required the use of ammonia, noble metals and high temperatures, the method of the present invention employs a carbon fiber or an inter host carbon particle reactant and temperatures which need not exceed about 5500 C. Preparation of highly chemically reactive carbon is described in U.S. Pat. No. 1,352,162. The process disclosed provides for the conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide over a finely divided metal catalyst such as iron, manganese, nickel or cobalt and the like in the virtual absence of air at atmospheric pressure and temperatures of below 7000 C. During the conversion, carbon is precipitated upon the catalyst which can be separately collected from the latter by mechanical or magnetic means.The carbon so formed is said to be ashless, highly pure and reactive and suitable for nitrogen fixation processes. U.S. Pat. No. 1,838,577 is directed toward a process for removal of only traces of oxides of nitrogen together with noxious reactive hydrocarbons from coke oven gas by passing the gas through a filter containing an adsorptive medium. The adsorptive medium is active carbon, the catalytic effect of which is said to be increased by impregnation with metals or metal salts. The patentee further discloses that other materials, such as silica gel, can be employed in lieu of active carbon. Lastly, U.S. Pat. No. 4,060,589 discloses a process for simultaneously reducing NO and SO components from stack gases by passing the stack gases over bituminous coke at temperatures between 4820 C and 8710 C. Water vapor in the stack gases is said to react with the coke to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen, the former reacting with the NO and the latter reacting with the 502. The x patentees state that although the conversion is not believed to be effected by catalytic means, the coke may contain specific metals, such as iron, which may accelerate the reductions. The process does appear to be operable on SO and some of the NO present, both of which were present in trace amounts in a synthetic stack gas employed in the examples. Although the process of the present invention employs carbon, the carbon does not function as an adsorbant, but chemically reacts with the oxides of nitrogen present to form nitrogen gas. To be useful, such a process should be capable of converting large amounts of nitrogen oxides, not just traces, and at temperatures that are not exceedingly high. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for the conversion of large amounts of various nitrogen oxide compounds such as NO, NOz N2O5 and N20 with a carbon material chemically reactive therewith. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process for the conversion of the aforesaid nitrogen oxides which can be conducted at temperatures of up to about 8000 C. It is another object of the present invention to provide a process for the conversion of the aforesaid nitrogen oxides by employing a carbon material that can be exhausted in a one time usage or which can be regenerated in situ for extended periods of usage. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a process for the conversion of the aforesaid oxides of nitrogen with a relatively cheap compound which does not require the co feeding of ammonia and which can be readily employed in a variety of gas molecules. These and other objects, together with the advantages thereof over the prior art, which shall become apparent from the specification which follows are accomplished by our invention as hereinafter described and claimed. In general the process for the present invention includes the step of passing one or more oxides of nitrogen over a reactant carbon fiber material or inter host carbon particle at a temperature of from about 4500 C to about 7500 C. Pressure during the reaction can range from atmospheric to as high as 20 to 30 atmospheres. The process also may be practiced by co feeding a carboncontaining gas with the oxide of nitrogen in which instance the reactant material can be continually and simultaneously regenerated. Hydrogen gas may also be fed if the carboncontaining gas is not a hydrocarbon. The component or reactant utilized in the practice of the subject invention is a carbon fiber structure which comprises carbon and a metal such as iron, nickel or cobalt. The carbon fiber reactant is formed by deposition of carbon over a catalyst or host material. Alternatively, an inter host carbon particle is employed which is grown inside a host material rather than over the host material.For purposes of discussion, the reactant material, whether in the form of carbon fibers or inter host carbon particles, shall be referred to hereinafter as the carbon fiber reactant or just the reactant. Also reference to the re actant being carried by the host can mean either on or in the host as is applicable. The host material comprises a metal, such as iron, nickel or cobalt, which may be preferentially carried on a support material. Suitable support materials include . silica, alumina, titania, silicon carbide, carborundum, zirconia, Alundum, mixtures thereof and the like. In one preparation of the host material, a solution of the metallic salt, e.g., the nitrate, in water is utilized to impregnate an already prepared support. Alternatively, the metallic reagent or reagents and a colloidal support can be spray dried together. Or, a nonsupported form such as an ore, steel wool, metal bar and the like can be employed. When impregnation of a support is used, it is then calcined at a temperature of about 3500 C and 7000 C for one to six hours to obtain the oxides of the metal.This catalyst is then reduced by the addition of typical reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrazine. The composition of the catalyst or host material thus formed, by weight percent, comprises from about three to 95 percent metal and from about 97 to five percent support with a 10 to 40 percent 90 to 60 percent composition, respectively, being preferred. After reduction of the host material, as with hydrogen, carbon fibers are deposited thereon. This is facilitated by passing carbon monoxide, preferably with some hydrogen, or only a hydrocarbon over the host at a temperature of about 4500 to 6500 C for about one half to eight hours. Ratio of the two gases, on a volume basis, hydrogen carbon monoxide, is from about 0 1 to about 1 2 with 1 5 being preferred. The flow of hydrogen and carbon monoxide or of hydrocarbon can be repeated and interspersed with a separate flow of hydrogen to remove some of the deposited carbon, thereby assisting activation. Although hydrogen is not absolutely necessary, as in the carbon monoxide, its presence facilitates the reaction. As a result of the foregoing passage of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, carbon is deposited on or in the host material. The composition of the fibers is partially carbon and partially metal from the host, the carbon content of the fibers being from about five to about 98 percent by weight, with 70 to 95 percent being preferred.The carbon is the reactant utilized in the conversion of the nitrogen oxides to nitrogen in the process of the present invention. If the carbon is in the form of fibers, they can be separated from the host material or employed therewith, as they were formed, depending upon the system being employed for the conversion reaction. Inasmuch as the reactant fibers are consumed during the conversion process they have not been referred to as a catalyst. The reactant carbon fibers can be employed in known reactors for the conversion of the nitrogen oxides, such reactors including but not limited to fixed bed, fluid bed particularly when the host material is prepared by spray drying , and radial flow. The conversion process involves the step of passing the nitrogen oxide or oxides directly over the reactant carbon fibers in the reactor at a temperature of from about 4500 to about 7500 C. Residence time of the nitrogen oxide over the carbon fibers will vary depending upon factors such as the type of reactor as well as its size and that of the bed, however, on a mole percent basis it is believed that the carbon fibers can convert approximately one to more than two moles of nitrogen oxide per mole of reactant. While in the foregoing process, the reactant is eventually consumed and conversion ceases, it is also possible to provide for the continuous and simultaneous regeneration of the reactant carbon fibers where a continuous conversion process would be expeditious. To do so, a stream of carbon containing gas such as carbon monoxide and preferably some hydrogen is fed with the nitrogen oxides in a ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide of about.0 1 to 1 2 and carbon to nitrogen oxide of greater than 1 1. In lieu of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane or other hydrocarbons such as kerosene or naphtha can be employed and require less, or no hydrogen, in the process. As a further variation, the spent host could be removed from the reactor and separately regenerted or the nitrogen oxide flow could be terminated while regeneration is taking place. In the examples which follow, a volume of an oxide of nitrogen was converted to nitrogen gas. The reactant carbon fiber utilized in the process was prepared by placing a charge of 3.79 g of catalyst or host material, comprising 20 Fe and 80 Sits, into a quartz tube, 81.28 cm long 28 mm O.D. and 25 mm I.D. The tube was placed in a 3.175 cm I.D. Hevi Duty split tube furnace 63.5 cm long and was stoppered at each end for gas inlet and outlet. The quartz tube and its contents were heated to 7200 C. Hydrogen was then passed through the tube for one hour at a rate of 49 cc min to reduce the metal. At this point the catalyst or host material had turned grey. The rate of flow of hydrogen was thereafter decreased and the temperature was lowered to 5500 C and maintained there.Next a mixture of hydrogen 32 cc min and carbon monoxide 168 cc min was passed through the tube from left to right for 30 minutes and then reversed for another 30 minutes in order to ensure better coverage of the host and satisfactory deposition of the carbon fiber. The flow of combined gas was then terminated and followed by hydrogen only 109 cc min from left to right for 30 minutes for activation by removal of some of the deposited carbon. Following this treatment, the flow of hydrogen and carbon monoxide employed earlier was resumed for 30 minutes from left to right. The reactant carbon fibers were then ready for nitrogen oxide conversion, as set forth in the Examples hereinbelow. Examples In the same quartz tube, containing the reactant carbon fibers and host material, a flow of 23 cc min of the oxide of nitrogen being converted was passed at 5500 C.After a 30 minute period, a gas sample was taken from the effluent and analyzed by gas chromatography and was found to be free from the nitrogen oxide while containing a very high mole percent of nitrogen.In Table I below, the analvsis of the effluent was for three examples, Example l nitrogen oxide Example 2 nitrous oxide, and Example 3 nitrogen dioxide are reported, each being converted as set forth in the preceding paragraph. For purposes of comparison, a Control was run by using 5.872 g of the foregoing Fe SiO2 catalyst, which was carbon free. The amount of nitrogen subsequently formed was considerably low with more than 97 nitrogen oxide being found in the effluent. The amount of nitrogen or other gases in the effluent was determined by gas chromatography. TABLE I Conversion of Nitrogen oxides Effluent Gas mole Ex am ple No. Feed Gas O2 N2 CO CO2 CH4 NO NO2 H2O Control NO O 1.86 O 0.16 O 97.98 1 NO 4.72 57.38 4.41 31.25 2.25 O 2 N2O 9.21 42,85 30.81 14.72a 2.41 3 NO2 5.75 51.04 13.56 28.61b O 1.04 b a The retention time of N2O and CO2 are about the same b The retention time of NO2 and CO2 are about the same As can be determined from the data in Table I, very high conversions of the various nitrogen oxides to nitrogen gas were obtained.Residual amounts of N20 andNO2 for Examples 2 and 3 respectively, could not be de termined as footnoted, however, the amounts thereof should be zero or very close to zero based upon the high amounts of nitrogen gas formed and present in the effluent gas.Considering the conversion of NO, one mole will react with approximately one half mole of carbon. At a flow rate of 23 cc min of NO and assuming a 1008 conversion thereof, the carbon reactant would not be totally removed until more than two hours of use. Based upon these results it is apparent that the process of the present invention is useful for converting nitrogen oxides into nitrogen. The carbon fiber reactant can be utilized to treat a variety of gas streams where oxides of nitrogen are objectionable. One of these for instance could be the nitrogen oxide decomposition products of nitric acid and or processes. By employing an apparatus containing a specific amount of the reactant carbon fibers, oxides normally encountered when filling or emptying a tank of nitric acid could readily be converted to nitrogen. In this system, regeneration would most likely not be im portant. Other uses could include the treatment of com bustion exhaust gases, stack gases, feed pretreatment, effluent treatment, impurity removal and the like. De pending upon the costs involved as well as the practi cality, the process could be tailored for a one time use or continuous conversion. As stated hereinabove, the reactant carbon fibers that can be employed in the practice of the process of this invention can contain iron, nickel or cobalt in the amounts disclosed herein. It is to be understood that variations. of the disclosure fall within the scope of the claimed invention and that the subject invention is not to be limited by the examples set forth herein. They have been provided merely to provide a demonstration of operability and therefore the selection of metals, reducing agents, carbon containing gases, host materials and the like, can be determined without departing from the spirit of the invention herein disclosed and described. Moreover, the scope of the invention shall include all modifications and variations that fall within the scope of the attached claims.
