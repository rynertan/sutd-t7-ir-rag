# A locking device for a cover of magnetic tape cartridge.

## Abstract
A locking device for a cover of a magnetic tape cartridge 3 for locking a pivotable cover 4 for covering magnetic tape inlet and outlet ports 16 and 17 of the magnetic tape cartridge, including a projection 70 formed on an arm 67 for pivotally supporting the pivotable cover which is engage able with an engaging claw section 74 of a locking member 73 which further includes an operation section 75 and a resilient section 76 . The locking member is pivotally supported on a magnetic tape cartridge case 3 and urged by the biasing force of the resilient section to bring the engaging claw section into engagement with the projection. The operation section of the locking member is located in a position in which it is capable of cooperating with an unlocking pin moved from three directions, to thereby give latitude to the process for loading a magnetic tape cartridge on a magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus.
