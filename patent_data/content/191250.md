## Description
The present invention relates to a composition for producing baked products, especially sponge cake and crepe for wrapping jam, cream, chocolate and the like. A product having a good texture, elasticity, solubility in the mouth, flexibility and other factors has been required for a baked product such as a sponge cake or a crepe sheet. Hitherto, various methods for producing the baked product have been proposed. For instance, a method was proposed for improving the quality of sponge cake in Examined Jap. Pat. Appln. Gazette No. 31 746 1969, wherein into a basic raw material containing wheat flour as a main component, a polysaccharide gum obtained by subjecting a starch or its decomposition product to fermentation is added in an amount of 0.1 to 2 based on wheat flour, or in addition thereto, a quality improving agent comprising 10 to 40 parts of a polyhydric alcohol or a starch decomposition product, 10 to 60 parts of a surface active agent, 1 to 5 parts of a synthetic or natural high molecular compound and 1 to 5 parts of a protein are added in an amount of 2 to 7 based on the wheat flour. Another method was proposed for producing a crepe sheet in Unexamined Jap. Pat. Appln. Gazette No. 74 945 1984, wherein wheat flour, eggs, oil or fat and water are added and mixed together to prepare a batter then baked to make the sheet In the method, disclosed in said Examined Jap. Pat. Appln. Gazette No. 31 746 1969, a polysaccharide gum is added to the basic raw material or in addition thereto a quality improving agent containing as its main components, a polyhydric alcohol such as glycerine, methylcellulose and a surface active agent is added to delay staling and retrogradation of the product, but the water activity in the product is somewhat higher and thus growth of bacteria can not sufficiently be inhibited. Therefore, the resulting product can not be stored over a long period of time. Further, the feeling in the mouth gradually becomes worse due to the staling and retrogradation of oxidation of the product in the course of time. In the method disclosed in said Unexamined Jap. Pat. Appln. Gazette No. 74 945 1984, a characteristic of withstanding mechanical folding is given to the product by adding xanthane gum to the basic raw material and setting a final moisture content of the baked product to a specific value of 40 to 45 , but inhibition of bacteria growth has also not been attained and thus the product cannot be stored over a long period of time. It therefore, has disadvantages similar to the former method. In the apparatus disclosed in said Examined Jap. Pat. Appln. Gazette No. 6 545 1975, the heater is rotated together with the rotary drum. In such a structure, it is necessary to have a rotary transducer and a power supply device with a special slip ring which withstands the high electric power which is supplied to the heater. The thickness of the rotary drum should, of course, be made larger for accommodating or incorporating the heater therein to require much time for heating up the surface of the rotary drum to a desired level and this means that an expensive material having high efficiency in thermal conductivity, such as copper, should be selected for the rotary drum. Since the heater is embedded in the rotary drum, further, it is difficult to repair when a heating wire is broken. Additionally it is difficult to attain uniform heating of the rotary drum, so that the entire outer surface thereof cannot serve as the heating area, since the baking temperature of both sides thereof is relatively lower than that of the center area. An object of the invention is to provide a useful composition for producing baked products. A specific object of the invention is to provide a composition for producing baked products which can be stored over a relatively long time period without causing any noticeable reduction in quality, mouth feeling, i.e. palatability, and other characteristics thereof. Another specific object of the invention is to provide such composition which can be baked in an apparatus wherein a rotary drum can be uniformly heated in a relatively short time period and a heating element therefore is not rotated. According to the invention, we provide a composition for producing a sponge cake or crepe sheet, consisting essentially of As the water soluble thickening agent, xanthane gum is the most preferred in view of its characteristics for providing hardness, elasticity and palatability to the baked product. It is necessary to add the water soluble thickening agent in an amount of 0.1 to 0.5 weight based on the total weight of the ingredients. If the added amount thereof is less than about 0.1 weight , the resulting baked product has not sufficient elasticity, is very fragile and has a bad mouth feeling and if the added amount is higher than about 0.5 weight , vaporization of moisture during the baking is greatly inhibited and the resulting baked product will become gummy. According to one aspect of the invention, gluten is added to improve the mouth feeling of the resulting baked product in an amount of 1.0 to 1.5 weight based on the total weight of the ingredients. If the added amount is less than about 1.0 weight , the apparent specific density of the baked product becomes too high so as to reduce the mouth feeling and more particularly solubility in the mouth, and if the added amount is higher than about 1.5 weight , the apparent specific density becomes too low and also causes an undesirable change in mouth feeling and in addition thereto, the outer surface of the baked product becomes rough and undesirable and reduces its value or marketability. The use of both a water soluble thickening agent and or gluten in said ranges provides a crepe sheet having a somewhat hard and tough texture, which is suitable for wrapping somewhat hard filling or a filling of a larger amount, such as a hamburg steak, a salad and the like. Examples of the starch hydrolysate are degradation products of starch, such as a glucose syrup, or dextrin converted with acids, enzymes or pressurised treatment, derivatives of starch, or degradation products of the derivatives, for instance starch acetate, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, or starch monophosphate which can be obtained through a chemical reaction of a reduction or oxidation, chemical cross linking or the like. In the invention, the starch hydrolysate is added as a substitute for raw material wheat flour and more particularly for a starch component therein to reduce water activity and to prevent scaling and retrogradation. It is preferable to use the starch hydrolysate having a mean molecular weight higher than about 655 to attain this purpose and not to influence the mouth feeling of the baked product. If the mean molecular weight is less than about 655, the resulting baked product has an undesirable mouth feeling, and staling or retrogradation takes place, i.e. the property of the baked product is similar to the substitution of monosaccharides or disaccharides. It is preferable to add the starch hydrolysate in an amount of about 20 to 60 weight andmore particularly of about 30 to 50 weight based on the total weightof the starch hydrolysate and the wheat flour. If the added amount is less than about 20 weight , the staling and retrogradation or deterioration of the baked product can not sufficiently be avoided, and in the case of about 60 weight or more, the mouth feeling of the baked product will become harder, due to the physical characteristics of the starch hydrolysate. The preferred starch hydrolysates which may be used in the present invention are glucose syrups, dextrins, hydrogenated starch hydrolysates and the like having a mean molecular weight of at least about 655. The hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are obtained by the hydrogenation of glucose syrups, dextrins and maltodextrins in the presence of Raney Ni, which proceeds without isomerization and decomposition. Thus obtained hydrogenated starch hydrolysates typically contain a mixture of glucitol and hydrogenated oligosaccharides as well as other hydrogenated products. Method of making hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are disclosed in Examined Jap. Pat. Appln. Gazette No. 18 898 1969. It is preferable that the baked product produced by the method of the invention has a moisture content less than about 35 weight and more particularly in a range of about 27 to 32 weight . If it exceeds more than about 35 weight , water activity in the baked product will become higher than about 0.92 and in consequence the desired effect on inhibition of bacteria growth will not occur. According to the method of the invention, as seen from above, excellent baked products can be produced, which show a good mouth feeling and solubility in the mouth, and will withstand storage for a relatively long time period. A degree of sweetness of the product can be selected as desired. The composition can be baked in an apparatus which comprises an open vessel to store batter for the baked product, a transfer or transcription roller which is rotary driven and a part of which is immersed in the batter in said open vessel to feed the batter adhered on its outer surface thereof, a baking roller arranged adjacent to said transcription roller to bake the batter transferred from said transcription roller to its outer heating surface, and a scraper for peeling off the baked product from said baking roller, said baking roller comprising a stationary tubular body of a magnetic material, which has a longitudinal slit extending from one end to the other end, an exciting coil body arranged on said stationary tubular body, and an outer hollow cylindrical member of a magnetic material, which is rotatably supported in a concentric manner to said stationary tubular body and adjacent to and outside of said exciting coil body. In the apparatus having such a structure, an alternating magnetic flux is generated in a closed magnetic circuit formed by the stationary tubular body, exciting coil body and rotatable outer hollow cylindrical member, when the exciting coil body is connected to an alternating current source. Due to generation of the alternating magnetic flux, a short circuit current flows in the outer hollow cylindrical member in pheripheral direction thereof to generate heat due to the Joule effect which raises the temperature of the outer hollow cylindrical member. The outer hollow cylindrical member is also heated due to hysteresis loss, as the alternative magnetic flux passes therethrough. Therefore the outer hollow cylindrical member is sufficiently heated so as to bake the batter transferred on its outer surface from the transfer roller. In the apparatus of the invention, as is evident from the above, special parts required for the conventional apparatus, such as a slip ring, rotary transducer and the like can be omitted so as to make a simple mechanical structure of much increased durability and so as to make maintenance thereof easy. The outer hollow cylindrical member of the baking roller has no heating element embedded therein and thus non expensive thin magnetic metal material can be employed. Further,a rapid and uniform heating of the outer hollow cylindrical member can easily be attained, so that the entire outer surface thereof can serve as a baking area to improve productivity of the baked product. In Figs. 1 and 2, there is schematically shown a preferred embodiment of the apparatus 10 according to the invention. In the figures, reference numeral 12 shows an open vessel to accommodate batter 14 for producing a relatively thin sponge cake or a sheet for baked product such as crepe, spring roll, omelet and the like. Above the open vessel 12, a transcription roller 16 is rotatably arranged, so that a part of the transcription roller 16 is immersed or dipped in the batter 14 to continuously transfer the batter to an outer surface of the transcription roller 16 by its adhesiveness. Adjacent to an outer periphery of the transcription roller 16, there is arranged a doctor blade 16a to adjust the thickness of an adhered batter layer 14a in constant, which depends on a set position of the doctor blade 16a. A baking roller 18 is arranged above and in parallel to the transcription roller 16 to receive the batter layer 14a therefrom. Adjacent to an outer periphery of the baking roller 18 and at a position apart from the batter receiving position, there is arranged a scraper 18a to peel off the baked product 14b which may be fed by a transferring device 20 such as a conventional belt conveyor. The resulting baked continuous web like product 14b can be severed by a cutting device not shown which may be arranged above the belt of the transferring device 20. The transcription roller 16 and baking roller 18 may be synchronizedly driven by a common electric motor but it is preferable to drive each roller 16, or 18 by a different electric motor 22 or 24 Fig. 2 which is able to adjust its rotational speed, so that the baking condition can be modified depending on the composition and thickness of the batter 14 as well as other various factors. In Figs. 3 and 4, there is shown the baking roller 18 in more detail. As seen from the figures, the baking roller 18 comprises a stationary tubular body 24, an exciting coil body 26 arranged on the stationary tubular body 24 and an outer hollow cylindrical member 28 arranged rotatably to a core member of the stationary tubular body 24 and coil body 26. Both of the stationary tubular body 24 and the outer hollow cylindrical member 28 are made of a magnetic material such as iron, carbon steel, silicon steel or the like. The stationary tubular body 24 has a longitudinal slit 24a extending from one end to the other end as well as a pair of flanges 24b,24b between which a thin wire or wires and wound to form the exciting coil body 26. The outer hollow cylindrical member 28 is rotatably mounted on the stationary tubular body 24 through rotary bearings 30,30. The inner surface of the main part 281 seen as in Fig. 3 of the outer hollow cylindrical member 28 is positioned adjacent to the free edge surface of the flanges 24b,24b of the tubular body 24. In the main part 281 of the outer hollow cylindrical member 28, there are formed spaces 281a,281b. The space 281a accommodates water or another liquid heating medium under a reduced pressure and the space 281b accommodates a temperature sensor such as a thermocouple 32. If an alternating current source not shown is connected to leads 26a,26b for the exciting coil body 26, an alternating magnetic flux to be generated by the exciting coil body 26 generates in a closed magnetic circuit as shown by the ghost line Fig. 5 shows another preferred embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention. The apparatus has a structure similar to that as shown in Figs. 1 to 4 and thus the same reference symbols but with an apostrophic symbol are given to its structural elements. According to the apparatus 10 , a plurality of baked continuous web like products can concurrently be produced, which may be severed in width direction to obtain products, each of which has a desired size. This can be attained by, for instance, arranging a plurality of projections to a doctor blade not shown which may be similar to that as shown in Fig. 1, the free end of said projections contacting the outer surface of the transcription roller 16 . Of course, such projections can be formed on a member separate from the doctor blade to attain this purpose. The invention will now be further explained with reference to Baked Product Manufacturing Examples and Test Example. It is to be noted that the parts in the Examples are by weight and a baking apparatus was employed as illustrated in Figs. 1 to 4, or a conventional baking oven was employed. To 300 parts of whipped egg, 300 parts of sucrose were added to whip the mixture. In the mixture, 180 parts of cake flour, 120 parts of powdered hydrogenated starch hydrolysate mean molecular weight of 670 , 3 parts of xanthane gum and 11 parts of gluten were added. After gentle stirring of the mixture, 100 parts of melted butter were added and then the resulting material was further gently stirred to obtain a batter. The powdered hydrogenated hydrolysate was obtained by the hydrogenation of glucose syrup DE 20 . The batter was charged to the apparatus and baked at 170 C to obtain a sponge cake . The batter was also charged into a wooden frame on a flat pan and baked under the same conditions as above, in an oven. The cake showed excellent mouth feeling and good solubility in the mouth. 250 parts of egg, 250 parts of sucrose and 800 parts of city milk were mixed and then 100 parts of melted margarine were added thereto to mix in the same. To the mixture, 250 parts of cake flour, 125 parts of dextrin DE 3 , 125 parts of powdered glucose syrup DE 32 and 3 parts of xanthane gum were added to mix in the same. Resulting batter was charged to the apparatus and baked at 180 C for 45 seconds to obtain a crepe sheet having a thickness of 1mm. The batter was also spread on a flat pan and baked in an oven under the conditions as above to obtain a similar baked product. The sheet product showed excellent mouth feeling and good solubility in the mouth.

To the mixture, 200 parts of egg and 100 parts of melted margarine were added and then 350 parts of cake flour and 25 parts of gluten were added to stir slowly and mix in the same. Finally 3 parts of gelatin swelled previously with water were added thereto to mix in the same. The hydrogenated starch hydrolysate was the same as that used in Example 3. The resulting batter was charged to the apparatus and baked at 180 C for 60 seconds to obtain a crepe sheet having a thickness of 1mm. The batter was also spread on a flat pan and baked in an oven under the same conditions as above. The sheet product showed relatively high elasticity and hardness. It was judged that such a sheet product is suitable for wrapping a filling in a larger amount or a relatively hard filling such as a salad, hamburg steak or mixture thereof. 250 parts of egg, 250 parts of sucrose, 800 parts of city milk and 250 parts of powdered hydrogenated starch hydrolysate mean molecular weight of 670 were mixed. To the mixture, another mixture of 250 parts of cake flour and 3 parts of one of thickening agents as listed in following Table 1 were added and mixed further in the same. Then 110 parts of melted margarine were added and mixed to obtain various batters. The powdered hydrogenated starch hydrolysate was the same as that used in Example 1. Each of the batters was spread on a flat pan and baked at 180 C for 60 seconds to obtain crepe sheets having a thickness of 1mm, in an oven. Each of the batters was also charged to the apparatus and baked under the same conditions as above. A control was produced in a similar manner to the above, except that the hydrogenated starch hydrolysate in said composition was replaced by cake flour and no thickening agent was added. These sheet products were subjected to various tests to obtain results shown in the following Table 1. In the Table Various batters were produced by changing an amount of xanthane gum in the composition as in Example 2, and each of the batters was spread on a flat pan and baked to obtain sheet products in an oven under the same conditions as above.

Each of the batters was also charged to the apparatus and baked under the same conditions as above. Each of the products was subjected to a sensory test 20 people . Results thereof are shown in the following Table 3. In the Table 300 parts of egg were whipped and then 300 parts of sucrose were added and whipped butter in the same. To the whipped mixture, another mixture of 150 parts of cake flour, 1.2 parts of xanthane gum, and 150 parts of one of starch hydrolysates listed in the following Table 4 were added and stirred gently in the same to obtain various batters. Each of the batters was spread on a flat pan and baked as in Example 1 to obtain sponge cakes under the same conditions as above. Each of the batters was also charged to the apparatus and baked under the same conditions as above. The products were subjected to a sensory test 20 people . Results thereof are shown in the Table 4. It can be recognized therefrom that the starch hydrolysates having a mean molecular weight of about 655 or more are preferable. In the Table 250 parts of egg, 250 parts of sucrose and 800 parts of city milk were mixed. To the mixture, 500 parts of cake flour and 3 parts of xanthane gum were added and mixed in the same, and then 100 parts of melted margarine were added and mixed further in the same. In such a mixture, the powdered hydrogenated starch hydrolysate was replaced to cake flour in various amount to obtain corresponding batters. Each of the batters was spread on a flat pan and baked as in Example 3 to obtain crepe sheets. Each batter was also charged to the apparatus and baked as in Example 3 to obtain crepe sheets. Each sample was stored at 23 C for 45 days and the hardness thereof was measured in the course of time. The samples crepe products were also subjected to a sensory test. Results are shown in the following Table 5. In the Table From the results shown in Table 5, the Sample A shows earlier staling and retrogradation of the starch component in the baked product, as seen from a rapid rise in hardness thereof, and the Sample E has not a good mouth feeling, although there is no change in hardness. The Samples B, C and D are suitable, since each of them shows a slow change in hardness and a good mouth feeling, and in addition thereto, a lower value in water activity, which means an improvement in storage stability or withstanding to bacteria growth. 200 parts of egg, 150 parts of sucrose, 80 parts of whole milk powder, 250 parts of hydrogenated starch hydrolysate having a mean molecular weight of 640 30 weight of moisture content and 700 parts of water were mixed. To the mixture, 100 parts of melted margarine were added and mixed in the same and then 250 parts of cake flour and 3 parts of xanthane gum were added and mixed to obtain a batter. The hydrogenated starch hydrolysate was the same as that used in Example 8. The batter was spread on a flat pan and baked at 180 C for 20 seconds in an oven to obtain a crepe sheet having a thickness of 1mm. The batter was also charged to the apparatus and baked under the same conditions as above. The sheet product was subjected to a sensory test 20 members . The panel members judged that the sheet had not so good mouth feeling in softness and elasticity thereof. 200 parts of egg, 150 parts of sucrose, 80 parts of whole milk powder, 250 parts of hydrogenated starch hydrolysate having a mean molecular weight of 655 30 weight of moisture content and 700 parts of water were mixed. To the mixture, 100 parts of melted margarine were added and mixed in the same and then 250 parts of cake flour and 3 parts of xanthane gum were added and mixed to obtain a batter. The hydrogenated starch hydrolysate was the same as that used in Example 8. The batter was spread on a flat pan and baked at 180 C for 20 seconds in an oven to obtain a crepe sheet having a thickness of 1mm. The batter was also charged to the apparatus and baked under the same conditions as above to obtain a crepe sheet similar to the above. The sheet product was subjected to sensory test 20 members . The panel members judged that the sheet had good mouth feeling in softness and elasticity thereof. This shows that the starch hydrolysate to be employed should have a mean molecular weight of at least about 655, to improve mouth feeling of the baked product.
