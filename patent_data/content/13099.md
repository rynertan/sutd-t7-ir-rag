# Semiconductor integrated circuit device including a reference voltage generator feeding a plurality of loads.

## Abstract
A plurality of noise limiters 4X and 4Y have one end connected to an output of a reference voltage generator 1 and another end of each of which is connected to its corres ponding load circuit 2X and 2Y . The value of the impedance of the noise limiters 4X and 4Y is of the same order or higher than the output impedance of the reference voltage generator circuit 1 . Preferably noise cancelling means 7 are also pro vided coupled between the noise limiters 4X and 4Y and their load circuits 2X and 2Y . Preferably the noise cancelling means are formed by capacitors 7X and 7Y connected across the loads 2X and 2Y .
