## Description
3, BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION i FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a controller for winding an unvulcanized rubber sheet, and more particularly to a controller for winding an unvalcanized rubber sheet applicable to a machine for molding tires and transmitting belts such as V belts, flat belts and serrated toothed belts. ii DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Heretofore, when an unvulcanized rubber sheet or an unvulcanized rubber sheet containing cloth, cords or short fibers hereinafter referred to as an unvulcanized rubber sheet in general is wound on a drum having a cylindrical outer periphery, an operator draws out the unvulcanized rubber sheet through a plyservicer to adhere an end of the rubber sheet to the surface of the drum, rotates the drum by a predetermined quantity to wind the rubber sheet and then cuts the rubber sheet. Accordingly, there are drawbacks that much labor is required and the productivity and the quality thereof are greatly dependent on a skill of the operator. In order to remove the drawbacks and improve the operation, there have been proposed many manners such as a manner for winding an unvulcanized rubber sheet previously cut in a predetermined length on a drum and a manner disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid open No.38144 83. However, in any manners, since the drum having a same peripheral length is used for a given period of time, it is necessary to change the setting condition such as the length of winding the rubber sheet on.the drum when the peripheral length of the drum is varied. Accordingly, when the periphral length of the drum is frequently changed as in the molding of the transmitting belt which is a product having various types but manufactured in a small quantity, the actual rate of operation of facilities and operators is nsarkabw reduced and the rate of occurrence of defective products due to the mistake of setting condition is increased.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is to be proposed in view of the above drawbacks in the prior art. An object of the present invention is to resolve the above drawbacks in the prior art and provide a controller for winding an unvulcanized rubber sheet capable of always attaining the correct winding operation of the rubber sheet automatically against the variation of the setting condition with the high working rate and preventing the occurrence of mistake of the operator. Accordingly, the gist of the present invention resides in a controller for winding an unvulcanized rubber sheet comprising a cylindrical drum rotated by a motor for winding the unvulcanized rubber sheet thereon, a conveyer for feeding the unvulcanized rubber on the drum, a data processor for calculating a ratio of peripheral velocities of the drum and the feeding conveyer and a feeding quantity of the unvulcanized rubber sheet on the basis of a previously inputted data and a sequence control unit responsive to an output of the data processor for controlling a sequence operation of a movable portion. Briefly explaining the controller for winding the unvulcanized rubber sheet, one or both of the drum and the feeding conveyer are driven by a DC servomotor or a pulse motor to be capable of changing the speed of rotation thereof continuously so that the peripheral velocities of the drum and the conveyer are electrically synchronized with each other. The variation of setting condition of the mechanical movable portion is made by the data processor on the basis of the previously inputted sequence order of the molding operation and the necessary data. With the controller so constructed, the molding operation in which the setting condition is varied for each operating cycle can be attained with the high working rate and the occurrence of mistake such as wrong setting of the condition by the operator can be prevented.Further, the outer peripheral length of the drum or the peripheral length corresponding to the length of a material attached on the drum is measured in advance before the rubber sheet is wound on the drum, and the winding length is automatically calculated on the basis of the measured data to set the calculated length. Thus, the peripheral length of the drum or the thickness of the material previously attached on the drum is automatically corrected so that the more exact winding operation can be attained. Since the above construction is provided in the present invention, the following effects are achieved. According to the present invention, even if the setting conditions containing the outer peripheral length of the drum, for example, are varied for each operating cycle, the high working rate can be maintained by the automatic control and the correct winding operation can be always attained. Therefore, the occurrence of the operating error by the operator can be effectively prevented.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a cross sectional side view of a portion showing the configuration of an embodiment of the present invention Fig. 2 shows a drive mechanism for winding the unvulcanized rubber sheet as viewed from the front side inFig. 1 Figs. 3 A , B and C show the winding procedure of the unvulcanized rubber sheet according to an embodiment of the present invention and Fig. 4 is a block diagram showing a necessary part of a controller according to an embodiment of the present invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT An embodiment of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.

The present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the formation of the V belt to which the present invention is applied. Concerning all types of V belts which are planned to be formed by the present controller, the specification data including the type number V and the peripheral length L for each V belt, the material number Mn of the used rubber sheet, the thickness Mt of the rubber sheet and the number of wound layers Mt corresponding to the grade number M and the number D of the used drum, the material number Mn of rubber sheet supplied to the servicer, the supply location thereof P the feeding device number and mechanical data described later are inputted and stored in the data processor 48.Before starting the formation of the belt, the designation data including the formation order N, the type number V, the peripheral length L and the grade number M of the V belt to be formed in a predetermined time of period are inputted to the data processor 48 and the operating control 50 is then operated to start automatically. The sequence circuit unit 49 then produces a data request signal to supply it to the data processor 48. When the data processor 48 identifies in response to the data request signal that the counter memory in the memory circuit is N, the CPU selects the type number V, the peripheral length L and the grade number M of the V belt of the formation order N on the basis of the designation data in the memory circuit to select the specification data corresponding to the selected designation data and performs a next operation. The forward stroke data signal for the feeding unit 6 and or 7 is given by EMI13.1 where a1, b1, c1 andd1 are mechanical data which are calculated by the following equation and inputted previously the data for the feeding units 6 and 7 are required to be calculated and inputted independently . a1 k1 S1 s1 , EMI13.2 CI d, 2,vh kl the number of pulse trains generated by the PG s 29 and 47 when the feeding units 6 and 7 are moved a unit distance.S1 the horizontal distance between the center of the drum 1 when the feeding units 6 and 7 are in a wait position and the center of the sponge rolls 36 and 38 being in the wait position.s1 the proper pressing stroke of the sponge rolls 36 and 38.r the radius of the sponge rolls 36 and 38.h the difference in height between the center of the drum 1 and the center of the sponge rolls 36 and 38. The results to be calculated by the following equation are previously set to the digital switch 57 as for the feeding units 6 and 7, respectively. The feeding length of the rubber sheet 4 and or 5 is given by X2 K2 L0 S2 k2 the number of output pulses supplied to the pulse motors 44 and 45 required to cause the feeding units 6 and 7 to feed the rubber sheets 4 and 5 a unit distance.Lo the length of the end 4b of the rubber sheet fed from the cutting position of the rubber sheet 4 by the cutter 33 before starting the winding operation this length is previously inputted to the data processor 48 as a mechanical data . Sz the distance between the cutting position of the rubber sheet 4 by the cutter 33 and the detection position by the photo electric switch 34. The data processor 48 supplys the above calculated result XI to the AC motor control units 64 and 65 and supplys the signal of the position number P for example 6 supplied with the rubber sheet having the used material number Mn to the sequence circuit unit 49. The sequence circuit unit 49 thus sends the start signal to the AC motor control unit for example, the AC motor control unit 64 and starts the measurement of the peripheral length. When the start command is supplied to the AC motor control unit 64, the feed screw 25 is rotated through the geared motor 28 with brake to move the feeding unit 6 forward to approach the drum 1 . When the number of the pulses generated by the PG 29 reaches the above value X1, the forward movement of the feeding unit 6 is stopped and the stroke completion signal is supplied to the sequence circuit unit 49. Thus, the sequence circuit unit 49 causes the relay circuil unit 60 to select the pulse generator 58 and the pulse motor diriver 62 and supplys the pulse generation command to the pulse generator 58 so that the feeding conveyer 30 is operated through the pulse motor 44 to feed the rubber sheet a.When the number of pulses generated from the generator 58 after the end 4b of the rubber sheet 4 has been detected by the photo elctric switch 34 reaches the value X2 preset to the digital switch 57 Fig. 3 A , the feeding conveyer 30 is stopped and the pulse generator 58 supplys the feeding completion signal to the sequence circuit unit 49. On the other hand, the peripheral length is measured during the above operation. The sequence circuit unit 49 first operates the air cylinder 17 through the pneumatic control device 66 to bring the peripheral length measureing roller 18 into contact with the surface of the drum 1 or the surface of the rubber sheet wound on the drum . The relay circuit unit 59 is caused to select the pulse generator 53 to start the veneration of pulse. and the drum 1 is rotated through the pulse motor driver 61 and the pulse motor 15. When the proximity switch 16 operates, the counter 51 starts to count the pulses of the PG 22 and when the proximity switch 16 operates next, the counter 51 stops to count the pulses of the PG 22 and the resultant count signalX3 is supplied to the data processor as with the count completion signal being supplied to the sequence circuit unit 49. The sequence circuit unit 49 stops the rotation of the drum 1 and returns the air cylinder 17 to its original position to terminate the measurement of the peripheral length. The data processor 48 performs the following calculation on the basis of the measured peripheral length data signal X3.Measured peripheral length Ln a3X3Frequency dividing ratio of drum Ko a4 Zd Frequency dividing ratio of conveyer Kc a5 LDixzd i 1, 2, winding order LD1 Ln M Xfrttk x Ml1xMt1 Lp, L 2 K 1xM 1 M 1xHtz xo 2 Wound rotational quantity X Lo i 1, 2, winding order LEI Ln L78 , X StT ss1 LE2 Ln L M2,xMt1 Ml2x t2 ss2 where alpha i and ssi represent correction coefficients on the basis of the characteristics and the lap area of the rubber sheet, and ZD represents the speed of rotation RPM of the drum when the rubber sheet is wound. These data are previously inputted as the specification data.Further, the data a3, a4, ar and a6 are the mechanical data calculated by the following equations and previously inputted. It may be convenient to utilize the following equation of a instead of utilizing the equation.

Thereafter, the pulse generation command is supplied to the pulse generator 54 and the pulse motors 15 and 44 are driven in synchronism with each other through the frequency dividers 55 and 56, the relay circuit units 59 and 60, and the pulse motor drivers 61 and 62 to wind the rubber sheet 4 on the drum 4. When the number of pulses generated by the pulse generator 54 reaches X Fig. 3 C , the pulse motors 15 and 44 are stopped and the winding completion signal is produced to the sequence circuit unit 49. Thus, the sequence circuit unit 49 controls the cutter 33 through a circuit not shown to cut the rubber sheet 4. Then, the pulse generator 54 is operated for a predetermined time to drive only the pulse motor 15 through the frequency divider 55, the relay circuit unit 59 and the pulse motor driver 61.After the remainig portion of the rubber sheet 4 is wound, the feeding unit 6 is returned to the wait condition and the winding process is terminated. In accordance with the specification of the V belt, further layers of the rubber sheet 5 may be wound by the same operation. When all the winding process is terminated, the sequence circuit unit 49 produces the end signal to the data processor 48 and causes the data processor 48 to perform the next process, that is, the exchange of the drum and the like.In the data processor 48, the counter memory in the memory circuit is incremented by 1 to be N 1 . Although the above description has been made to theV belt by way of example, the formation of the flat belt or the like can be made in the same manner if the formation includes the process of winding the unvulcanized rubber sheet on the drum. In the above embodiment, although only the pulse motor 15 is provided for rotating the drum 1, other equipments are provided in many cases and stitching and cutting operations are performed while rotating the drum 1.In such a case, it is advantageous in a cycle time that another motor is provided which is switched with the pulse motor 15 through a clutch to rotate the drum 1. In the case where the additional motor is switched through the clutch to rotate the drum 1 and the rotation of the drum 1 for measuring the peripheral length is made by the additional motor, the pulse generator 53 and the relay circuit unit 59 are removed in the circuit of Fig 4 and the frequency divider 55 may be directly coupled with the pulse motor driver 61. Further, although the pulse motors are used to drive both the drum 1 and the conveyer for the feeding units 6 and 7, one of them may be a DC servomotor, a DC motor withPG, an AC motor with PG or a pulse motor and the other may be a DC servomotor. In such a case, while the circuit of Fig. 4 is partly changed to be suitable for such a motor drive circuit, the variation is simple to those skilled in the art and the description will be omitted.
