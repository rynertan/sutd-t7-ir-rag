# Polydimethylsiloxanes having improved thermal stability.

## Abstract
Silicone compositions having improved thermal oxidative stability are disclosed. The compositions contain iron acetyl acetonate, nickel acetylacetonate, cerium acetylacetonate, alpha, omega bis trimethylsiloxy polydimethylsiloxanes, and optionally, a carboxylic acid. The compositions show greatly in creased time to gelation at temperatures of, e.g. 275 C.
