# Coated polyolefinic film having low adhesion to the welding bars.

## Abstract
Films comprising alpha olefin polymers, such as poly propylene consisting essentially of recurring propylene units and having a substantial crystalline polypropylene content, and in particular isotactic polypropylene, are rendered low adhesive to the welding bars of automatic and semi automatic machines conventionally used for the manufac ture of containers, evelops, bags, vessels and, in general, other manufactured articles useful in the packaging industry, by coating the films by a mixture of a copolymer of a vinyl ester with an unsaturated acid, a copolymer of an alkyl acrylate, an alkyl methacrylate and an unsaturated acid and a cross linking amine.
