# Methods for processing sonic data.

## Abstract
A method of sonic logging in which there is established at a depth of interest in a borehole a set of peak matrices comprised of peak vectors representative of a plurality of different characteristics of sonic signals traversing an earth formation. A set of rules is established based upon borehole sonic characteristics including the utilization of past histories of slowness and coherence values of wave components of interest. The matrices are searched in accordance with the rules to identify the presence in the sonic signals of wave components of interest, such, for example, as casing, com pressional, shear and Stoneley. The identified wave com ponents are recorded as a function of depth of interest, and the aforesaid steps are repeated at each depth of interest. The characteristics sought for each component include the maximum of peak coherence, the slowness at peak co herence, the time occurrence at peak coherence, coherent energy at peak coherence, coherent value at peak energy, the slowness at peak energy, the time occurrence at peak energy, and coherent energy at peak energy. The method is applicable to both open hole and cased hole sonic logging.
