Frequency synthesisers to which the invention is applicable are either of the direct type in which the output frequency is derived directly from the reference frequency or of the indirect , or phase locked loop, type in which the output frequency is generated by a voltage controlled variable frequency oscillator forming part of a phase lock loop which locks the oscillator frequency to a predetermined rational fraction which is to be understood herein as including a multiple of the reference frequency. In each type of frequency synthesiser, the delay or suppression of a cycle of the output signal of said arrangement would, if preventive steps were not taken, produce a resultant jitter in the period of the output frequency. The said control signal is employed in the arrangements known from the above quoted patent specifications to prevent this, and is generated by a circuit which includes a digital to analogue converter. However, this tends to result in the generation of a considerable amount of spurious sideband noise, and it is an object of the present invention to enable this disadvantage to be mitigated. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a frequency synthesiser comprising a reference frequency generator and a circuit for producing an output signal the frequency of which has a specific but variable ratio to that of the output signal of the reference frequency generator, which circuit has a reference frequency input coupled to the output of the reference frequency generator and an output coupled to the output of the synthesiser and comprises a frequency divider arrangement having a variable division ratio which determines said specific but variable ratio, and phase control means for controlling the phase of said output signal in response to the application of a control signal to a control signal input of said phase control means, said frequency divider arrangement comprising cancelling means for periodically cancelling the effect which a cycle of an input signal to said arrangement would otherwise have on the output signal of said arrangement and thereby each time delaying the occurrence of the next cycle of the output signal of said arrangement, this delay of the next cycle occurring for According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a frequency synthesiser comprising a reference frequency generator and a circuit for producing an output signal the frequency of which has a specific but variable ratio to that of the output signal of the reference frequency generator, which circuit has a reference frequency input coupled to the output of the reference frequency generator and an output coupled to the output of the synthesiser and comprises a frequency divider arrangement having a variable division ratio which determines said specific but variable ratio, and phase control means for controlling the phase of said output signal in response to the application of a control signal to a control signal input of said phase control means, said frequency divider arrangement comprising cancelling means for periodically cancelling the effect which a cycle of an input signal to said arrangement would otherwise have on the output signal of said arrangement and thereby each time suppressing a cycle of the output signal of said arrangement which would otherwise occur, this suppression of a cycle of the output signal of said arrangement occurring for A particularly convenient form of bidirectional signal is a train of bidirectional pulses with respect to the given d.c. level such that one pulse occurs in each period occupied by a cycle of the output signal of said arrangement or in each said period during which a cycle of the output signal of said arrangement which would otherwise occur is suppressed and in each said period during which a cycle of the output signal of said arrangement is not suppressed, respectively. The area of each pulse then gives the magnitude and the direction of each pulse the sign of the integral over the relevant period. The areas of the pulses in the bidirectional pulse train may be varied by pulse width or pulse height modulation or by a combination of both. If the information concerning the value of The invention also provides a modification of a synthesiser in accordance with the one aspect of the invention, in which modification the synthesiser includes means for periodically cancelling the effect which a further cycle of the input signal to said arrangement would otherwise have on the output signal of said arrangement and periodically creating in the output signal of said arrangement the effect of substantially the same number of cycles as the further cycles added to the input signal of said arrangement so that overall, for each cycle of the output signal of said arrangement, the occurrence of the next cycle of said output signal will either a be delayed by one period of the input signal of said arrangement, b be delayed by two periods of the input signal of said arrangement, c be advanced by one period of the input signal of said arrangement, or d be neither advanced nor delayed, the means for generating a bidirectional signal being modified to generate a bidirectional signal the integral of the difference between which and said given d.c. level over each period occupied by a cycle of the output signal of said arrangement is proportional to Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which Figure 1 shows a form of phase locked loop frequency synthesiser disclosed in intermediate document GB A 2117197, which synthesiser comprises a voltage controlled variable frequency oscillator VFO the output of which constitutes the synthesiser output frequency Fo and is connected to one input of a cycle cancellation, or pulse swallow , circuit PS. The output of circuit PS is connected to a programmable divider PD which divides by an adjustable number N 1. The output of divider PD is connected to a first comparison input of a phase comparator PC and also to the strobe input of a strobing circuit STR. The other input of circuit STR is connected to the output of an offset frequency generator OFS having a variable frequency Fos in a range which is low relative to the output frequency range of the synthesiser. For example, the synthesiser may have an output frequency range of 1.6 MHz to 30 MHz adjustable by divider PD in 1 kHz steps and the variable offset frequency generator OFS may have a range of 0 to 990 Hz variable in 10 Hz steps under the control of an input factor The output of strobing circuit STR is connected to the swallow command input of pulse swallow circuit PS and also to the input of a d.c. removal circuit DCR The operation of the phase lock loop control circuit VFO PS PD PC LPF VFO is well known and is described in terms of these referenced items in the abovementioned U.K. Patent Specification 1,447,418. Briefly, the output signal of comparator PC is integrated in a low pass filter LPF and adjusts the frequency of the oscillator VFO until the phase of the signal fed to the first comparison input of comparator PC from divider PD is identical to the phase of the signal fed to the second comparison input of the comparator PC The remainder of the circuit operates as follows. Output pulses from the generator OFS, having an average frequency Fos, are strobed in circuit STR by the output pulses of divider PD to produce output pulses of a defined length. These pulses operate circuit PS in precisely the same manner as the corresponding pulses Fr in Figure 2 of said Patent Specification No. 1,447,418 and offset the output frequency Fo by Fos. Thus Fos may be selected to give a very fine control of the output frequency Fo. These pulses form a pulse signal A which is applied to a d.c. removal circuit DCR which either removes any d.c. component in the pulse signal e.g. by a series capacitor or high pass filter or compensates for any saturation effect the d.c. may give rise to in the integrator. The resulting signal B is integrated by an analogue integrator INT to produce a signal C which is used to control the phase delay generated by phase modulator PM. As described above, the operation of the circuit PS in response to the pulse signal A causes jitter in the pulses appearing at the output of divider PD, this jitter appearing as a phase delay in the pulses each time circuit PS is caused to swallow a pulse by the arrival of a pulse in signal A. This same pulse is used, In effect, the signal C has a value which predicts any phase delay resulting from jitter and compensates for this delay accordingly. As would be expected, as the offset frequency Fos is increased, so the amount of jitter per unit of time increases and the slope of the jitter compensating signal C increases. The average value of the signal B is zero, due to the removal of the d.c. content, and hence the signal C is a function of the amount of jitter caused by the pulse swallowing technique. However the voltage step out of the phase comparator PC when a pulse is subtracted at the input to divider PD is proportional to the length of the pulse i.e. one cycle of the VFO output frequency and is therefore inversely proportional to the frequency Fo. Thus, in the case of a frequency synthesiser having a range of 1.6 MHz to 30 MHz, the amplitude of the signals dealt with by the jitter compensation circuit can vary if the synthesiser is switched from one end of its output frequency range to the other. This can cause inaccuracies in the jitter correction signal C and a gain controlled amplifier GCA is included in the correction signal circuit, the gain of the amplifier being controlled by a period to analogue converter PAC having the frequency Fo fed to its input. In this way, a very precise and accurate compensation for the effects of jitter is provided over the whole frequency range. The analogue output of integrator INT has a sawtooth waveform with a smooth ramp. This waveform is sampled at an instant in each cycle of the frequency Fr in order to shift the output phase of the phase modulator PM to effect the required phase compensation. Any variation in these sampling instants will therefore produce small phase errors in the output of modulator PM. Figure 2 is a block schematic circuit diagram of a synthesiser according to the invention which is based on the synthesiser shown in Figure 1. The various circuit blocks common to both Figures are given the same references. It will be noted that the function of the offset frequency generator OFS in Figure 1 is performed by a rate multiplier RM which multiplies the input frequency of the pulses Fr by a factor The function of frequency divider FDV is merely to reduce the output frequency Fo to a suitable value to serve as clock pulses Fc for the counter UDC and timing signal generator TSG. It may not be required in some cases. The up down count control input of counter UDC is fed with signal A and is arranged to count down if a swallow pulse is present in signal A A 1 and to count up if no pulse is present A 0 . Pulse generator PG is fed with sampling pulses at the frequency Fr. The operation of the synthesiser is the same as described with reference to Figure 1 except for the operation of circuit blocks FDV, UDC, PG, and TSG the operation of which will now be described with reference to Figures 3 to 7. It is assumed that the clock frequency Fc is fifteen times the sampling frequency Fr that is to say that there are fifteen clock pulses in each period of Fr. Referring first to Figure 3, which in effect functions as a DC suppression circuit, up down counter UDC comprises a known presettable up down counter CTR, for example Philips integrated circuit HEF 4510, the four count output bits of which are fed to a NOR gate NOR the output of which is connected to the count disable input of the counter and to the stop pulse input STP of a transmission gate controller TGC forming part of the pulse generator PG. Controller TGC provides a control signal on any one of leads U, M, and D to control the switching of three transmission gates TG1, TG2, and TG3 respectively. These gates may, for example, be provided as a Philips integrated circuit HEF 4O66B. A control signal on lead U causes gate TG1 to connect a positive DC voltage to the output lead HP to the filter HPF. A control signal on lead D causes gate TG3 to connect a negative DC voltage to lead HP and a control signal on lead M causes gate TG2 to connect a mid rail DC voltage e.g. ground to lead HP. As will be explained with reference to Figure 5, only one of the gates TG1, TG2, and TG3 can be in the conducting ON state at any one time so that the voltage on lead HP will be V, midrail, or V. If only a single supply voltage V is available, then for example the gates TG1, TG2, and TG3 may be connected to V, V 2, and 0 volts respectively. Timing signal generator TSG is provided with clock pulses Fc and the frequency Fr and provides a preset pulse to counter CTR on lead P and a start pulse on lead S to controller TGC. Signal A is fed to the up down command input. If a pulse is being cancelled by pulse swallow circuit PS, then signal A is a logic 1 and causes counter CTR to count down in response to clock pulses Fo and if no pulse is being swallowed signal A is a logic 0 and this causes counter CTR to count up. On receipt of a preset signal on lead P, the counter is preset with the value Figure 4 shows the circuit detail of the timing signal generator TSG which comprises three delay type flip flops DL1, DL2, and DL3, and two AND gates AN1 and AN2. As will readily be appreciated by those skilled in the art, each time signal Fr goes to 0 during a clock pulse Fc, a 1 pulse will first be given on lead P followed at the next clock pulse by a 1 pulse on lead S, each pulse having a width of one clock pulse period. This can be seen in waveforms Fc, Fr, P, and S in Figure 6 in which the frequency Fc is fifteen times the frequency Fr. The Fr transitions are not necessarily coincident with an Fc edge so that to maintain consistent pulse widths, the P pulses are initiated by the first positive going Fc edge following a negative going Fr edge rather than by the Fr edge itself. The exact timing of the Fr edge within any Fc cycle is therefore immaterial so far as the operation of the rest of the circuit is concerned, as indicated by the broken line in Figure 6. Figure 5 shows the circuit detail of the transmission gate controller TGC. The start pulse S is applied to respective first inputs of two AND gates AN3 and AN4 and signal A is applied to the second input of gate AN3 and Referring now to Figure 6, in which it is assumed that As explained above, the 1 pulse on signal P causes Thus it can be seen that in each period of Fr in which a cycle is not to be cancelled indicated by A 0 , signal HP does to V for a period which is directly proportional to Figure 6 also shows the case where A 1 . In this case the counter CTR is again preset with a count of 3 but now counts the Fc pulses upwards. After seven pulses the all 0 s state is reached and, during this count period, U 0 , M 0 , and D 1 . Therefore a pulse of V is provided on output HP for a period of seven clock pulses. Thus in each group of It will be apparent that precisely the same result will be achieved if the signals M, D, and U are used to gate clock pulses to the respective transmission gates TG1, TG2, and TG3. In this case each V pulse on lead HP will comprise three sub pulses and each V pulse will comprise seven sub pulses. All the clock pulses have the same area and so the sum of the areas of all the sub pulses in one direction will be equal to the sum of the areas of all the sub pulses in the other direction. As will be appreciated, for present purposes with respect to the bidirectional pulse train, a pulse in that train is still referred to as a pulse even though it may comprise a plurality of sub pulses. Figure 7 shows the waveform HP on a smaller scale and the sample times at frequency Fr are shown as vertical dotted lines. The sawtooth waveform LPE shows the loop phase error at the output of the phase comparator due to the cycle cancellation by signal A. While no cycles are being cancelled, the frequency Fr is slightly higher than the frequency Fr and so the phase error increases linearly as shown by each ramped portion of the waveform. Each time a cycle is cancelled, the phase error is reduced as shown by the vertical portions of the waveform LPE, the reduction being, in fact, 360 N The bidirectional signal HP, which is fed to integrator INT, shows the As explained above, the average DC level of the bidirectional signal remains constant irrespective of the offset frequency and, with ideal components, there is no need to provide the high pass filter HPF. However, in practical active integrators usually based on a differential operational amplifier there are usually small DC voltage and current offsets present on the integrator input. The input offset voltage is multiplied by one plus the magnitude of the d.c. voltage gain of the integrator to give an output offset voltage. The input offset current is multiplied by the d.c. feedback impedance to give a further output offset voltage. If a perfect integrator were to be used to integrate a bidirectional voltage signal, the d.c. voltage gain and the d.c. feedback impedance would both be infinite and hence the output would saturate. The introduction of leakage by placing a resistor across the integrating capacitor will reduce both the d.c. gain and the d.c. feedback impedance to finite levels. In most practical circuits it is not, however, possible to introduce sufficient leakage to reduce the output offset due to the input offset voltage to an acceptable level without also distorting the compensation signal. For this reason it is generally preferable to include a high pass filter HPF, or a series capacitor, in the signal path to the integrator when a bidirectional voltage signal is used so that the d.c. voltage gain is zero, although the performance of the synthesiser may be adequate for some purposes without the inclusion of the filter or capacitor. If the bidirectional signal is a current rather than a voltage signal, the high pass filter may be dispensed with. It is also to be noted that, as explained above, the output signal of integrator INT is constant at the sampling times. Thus any small variation of the sampling times will have no effect. If the value of If In the foregoing embodiment, the areas of the pulses are controlled by pulse width modulation. The pulse areas may alternatively be controlled by pulse height modulation, or by a combination of both. Pulse height modulation may, in some cases, be the more convenient method where the input value GB A 2117119 describes a frequency synthesiser in which, in addition to the cancelled cycles, further cycles pulses are added to and subtracted from the frequency to be reduced in such a manner that the output frequency of the synthesiser is not affected. The added and subtracted pulses form an injected perturbation signal. In the event of any residual imbalance in the jitter signal compensation circuit, a spurious signal of one or more discrete frequencies is produced. This spurious signal is, in effect, mixed with the perturbation signal and is thereby spread over a wide spectrum with the result that it appears as noise at a negligibly low level. Figure 8 shows such a synthesiser modified to provide a synthesiser according to the invention. In Figure 8 circuit blocks which correspond to those in Figure 2 have corresponding references and operate in the same manner. In UDC the connection between the output of NOR and the disable input of CTR shown in Figure 3 must, however, be broken as shown in Figure 9. The additional circuit blocks are a control device CD fed with strobing pulses Fr , a pulse adder PA, and a count extender CX. Control device CD provides two interspersed sequences of pulses P1 and P2. Each P1 pulse causes adder PA to add a pulse cycle to the frequency Fo and each P2 pulse causes pulse swallow circuit PS to cancel a pulse. A substantially equal number of P1 and P2 pulses are generated at the rate of one pulse in each period of Fr , such that over a time average, there is no nett phase error introduced as a result of the control signal from device CD and so the process does not affect the DC level of the pulse train to be integrated. Thus the frequency offset As explained with reference to Figure 2, signal A is 0 if no pulse is to be subtracted by circuit PS and 1 if a pulse is to be subtracted. The four cases are summarised in the Table, in which signal C is derived from signals A and B and is a 1 for each of the two new cases in which the count has to be extended by A practical embodiment of count extender CX is shown in Figure 9 together with the circuit connection to circuit blocks UDC, TSG, and PG of Figure 8. The relevant waveforms are shown in Figure 10. Count extender CX comprises an EXCLUSIVE NOR gate EX, two inverters IN1 and IN2, three AND gates, and a clocked delay flip flop DEL having set and clear inputs. Gate EX derives signal C from signals A and B as shown in the Table. The two inverters IN1 and IN2, the two AND gates AN6 and AN7, and the flip flop DEL constitute a well known presettable one bit counter in which the signal P functions as the preset load command. The all 0 s output Z1 of counter CTR is fed from gate NOR The left hand half of Figure 10 shows the case where signal A 1 causes a pulse to be subtracted and signal B 0 indicates that a pulse is to be added by circuit blocks PS and PA respectively. This case is shown on the second line of the Table. Signals P and S are the same as described with reference to Figure 6. When P goes to 1 with C 0 and Z1 0 , gate AN7 is enabled and Z2 goes to 1 . Counter UDC is loaded with The right hand side of Figure 10 shows the case where signal A 0 results in no pulse being subtracted by swallower PS and signal B 0 again indicates that a pulse is to be added by circuit PA. This case is shown on the first line of the Table. Signal C is 1 and gate AN6 is therefore enabled by the next P pulse. Flip flop DEL is set and signal Z2 goes to 0 . Counter UDC again counts to the all 0 s state from At the extreme right hand side of Figure 10 signal B is shown as going to 1 while signal A remains at 0 , this case being given on the third line of the Table. Since B 1 , the output HP pulse to the integrator will be a down pulse as shown and it will be appreciated from the foregoing that this down pulse will have a duration of Figure 11 shows a direct type of frequency synthesiser in which the output frequency Fo is derived directly from the output of a clock pulse generator CPG The output of rate multiplier RM is fed The jitter compensation signal circuit comprises a timing signal generator TSG, an up down counter UDC, a pulse generator PG and an integrator INT. The output of integrator INT is fed The operation of the circuit is as follows. The output pulses of rate multiplier RM are synchronised with the input pulses Fr and, due to the pulse cancellation in the rate multiplier, they have phase jitter with respect to an evenly spaced pulse train of the same frequency. The purpose of the remaining circuitry is to compute the phase errors between the rate multiplier output and a said evenly spaced pulse train and thereby remove the jitter errors. An analogue signal which is a function of the phase errors is derived from the output Frm of rate multiplier by circuit blocks TSG, UDC, PG, HPF, and INT in the same manner as described above with reference to Figures 2 to 5. The clock pulse frequency Fc may be derived, for example, from clock pulse generator CPG with the proviso that, since counter UDC has to count up to The integrated bidirectional compensation signal from integrator INT is divided in amplitude by Production of evenly spaced output pulses is as follows. An output pulse from the rate multiplier RM is delayed by delay DL for one clock period Fr to allow time for the analogue integration process to take place. This delayed pulse is then applied to the start input S of the ramp generator RG and causes generator RG to produce a ramp voltage at its output to the non inverting input of comparator COM. The voltage proportional to the required delay is fed to the inverting input of comparator COM from summing circuit SUM. When the ramp voltage reaches this delay voltage, the comparator output goes high and, in turn, resets the ramp generator The summing circuit SUM, the ramp generator RG and comparator COM together constitute a programmable delay generator which is controlled by the compensation signal from amplitude divider DV such that the output pulses of the delay generator are respectively delayed by such an amount that the periods of occurrence are equal. The amplitude divider DV may, for example, consist of a multiplying digital to analogue converter programmed with 1 In order to avoid any misunderstanding, it is hereby stated that, in the following claims, where technical features mentioned in any claim are followed by reference signs relating to features in the drawings and placed between parentheses, these reference signs have been included in accordance with Rule 29 7 EPC for the sole purpose of facilitating comprehension of the claim, by reference to an example.
