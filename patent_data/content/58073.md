# Acrylate maleate copolymers, their preparation and use as antiscalants.

## Abstract
Substantially homogeneous acrylate maleate copolym ers of number average molecular weight of 500 to 5000 at prepared by copolymerizing 35 to 65 mole percent acrylic methacrylic acid or a mixture thereof with 65 to 35 mole percent maleic anhydride at over a period of from 0.3 to 10 hours at 80 to 150 C in the presence of specified quantities a polymerization initiator and a chain transfer solvent, the solvent and mode of addition of the monomers to the solvent being such that both the monomers and the formed co polymer remain in solution and the mole ratio of the acrylic or methacrylic acid monomer to the maleic anhydride monomer in the solvent is maintained at from 0.005 to 0.2 throughout the polymerization. Also included are substan tially homogeneous copolymers consisting essentially from 35 to 65 mole percent acrylic or methacrylic acid units or a mixture thereof and from 65 to 35 mole percent maleic anhydride units and having a number average molecular weight of from 500 to 5000. The copolymers in hydrolyzed form are particularly useful in the prevention of alkaline calcium and magnesium scale formation, such as during sea water evaporative desalination.
