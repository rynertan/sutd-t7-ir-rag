# A non woven tube for membrane filtration and method of forming same.

## Abstract
A composite tube 1 of a heat sealable non woven material comprises an inner and an outer tube of non woven 2, 3 , each of said tubes being provided with a longitudinal seal 4, 5 obtained by ultrasonic sealing, the outer and inner tube 3, 2 being fixed with each other by adhesive spots 6 . The inner side of the inner non woven tube is coated with a membrane 8 for membrane filtration. The seal 5 formed by ultrasonic sealing in the outer tube 3 does not extend to the inner side of the inner tube 2 and preferably the seals 5, 4 in the outer and inner tube 3, 2 are staggered with respect to each other. The composite tube 1 is formed by first forming the inner tube 2 , applying spots 6 of an adhesive upon the outer side of the inner tube, and subsequently applying the outer tube 3 onto the inner tube 2 . During the step of forming the longitudinal seal 5 by ultrasonic sealing in the outer tube 3 , it is avoided that the seal as formed extends toward the inner side of the inner tube.
