# Liquid atomizing nozzle.

## Abstract
A nozzle unit comprising a frusto conical nozzle 22 having a transverse flat end face 82 , an outlet passage formed in this end face, an inner conduit member 42 which in use is connected to a source of air under pressure, a water conduit which in use is connected to a source of water under pressure, and a mixing chamber 44 in which the water and air is mixed and from which the mixture passes to be discharged through the outlet passage. The nozzle unit further has a concave cylindrical cap 48 which is carried by rigid carrier means 108 which is integral with the nozzle and into which the water air mixture is discharged, the water being there broken down into very small droplets. The mixing chamber 44 has a passage therethrough in the form of a venturi and inlet bores 104 from the exterior of the chamber to just downstream of the venturi throat 102 . In use, air passes through the venturi throat and the water is drawn in through the bores to the interior of the venturi throat and is there mixed with and entrained in the air.
