# Copolymers of alkyl poly oxyalkylene itaconates and thickening processes using them.

## Abstract
Copolymers useful for thickening aqueous systems comprise water insoluble emulsion copolymers of at least 10 by weight of certain carboxylic acids, especially acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and itaconic acid, and 0.5 30 by weight of certain alkyl poly oxyalkylene itaconates. Other monoethylenically unsaturated monomer, especially C₁ C₄ alkyl meth acrylates and, in an amount of at most 1 by weight, polyethylenically unsaturated monomer may also optionally be present. The copolymers, when at least partially neutralized and solubilized may be used to thicken such aqueous systems as paint latices, cosmetic prepara tions, food preparations, ionic detergents, dye pastes for textiles, pharmaceuticals and oil well drilling muds. The addition of surfactant enhances thickening properties afforded by the copolymers themselves.
