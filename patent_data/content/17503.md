## Description
GEM BIS HDROXYMETHYL ALCOHOLS AND MIXTURES THEREOFWITH DIOLS, PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION INVOLVING THEPREPARATION OF FORMYL ALCOHOLS, OF HYDROXYMETHYL FORMYL ALCOHOLS AND OF DIOLS AND A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATIONOF POLYURETHANES THEREFROM. This invention relates to products and processes useful in the manufacture of synthetic resins. Hydroformylation is basically defined as the addition of a formal qroup through the reaction of an unsaturated compound with carbon monoxide and hydrogen.The basic technolbgy for the manufacture of hydroformyl ated products and consequently their derivatives is amply set out hereinafter. Among the difficulties which must be met in the manufacture of hydroformylated products is the consideration that hydrogen gas, an explosive, and carbon monoxide, a hazardous material, are utilized in the process. Hydroformylation processes are also dependent on expensive metallic catalysts such as carbonyls which have high toxicity and high cost. The conditions for running a hydroformylation reaction also involve the use of substantial temperature and pressure thus necessitating costly equipment which must be maintained. Thus due to the various factors and considerations which go into the manufacture of hydroformylated products and their derivatives it is essential that the reactions individually and cummulatively give high purity of the desired end product and high yield thereby avoiding excessive handling of hazardous materials while minimizing the high capital cost and maintenance of such production facilities. In the past several attempts have been made to prepare hydroformylated products or similar materials such as is described in United States Patent 2,43,6OO toGresham et al issued March 9, 1948. The Gresham patent relates to the synthesis of organic oxygen containing compounds, in particular aldehydes.

The aldehydes produced generally correspond to the compounds obtained by the add it ion of a hydrogen and a formyl group to an olefinicably unsaturated group in the starting material thus saturating the olefinic bond. Most preferably the starting raw material is oleyl alcohol although linoleyl or linolenyl alcohol may be employed. It is of course noted than any number ofsynthetic unsaturated alcohols may also be employed in the present invention. However, for most purposes the naturally occuring alcohols derived from plant sources are presently most convenient and inexpensive. The unsaturated alcohol is reacted with hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide in the presence of a rhodium catalyst as later described to for the corresponding formyl alcohol having the formula CH3 CH2 m H 3O CH2 CH HO q 9 CH2 CH CHO s CH2 tCH20H wherein the various subscript numbers are as previously described. The addition of hydrogen and carbon monoxide is accomplished in practice by conveniently adding stoichiometric amounts of the hydrogen and carbon monoxide to give the formyl alcohol. To assure completeness of the reaction the amounts of hydrogen and carbon monoxide may be each maintained at from about 1.5 0.5 to about 0.5 1.5 molar ratio to one another. It is noted that the ratio is not critical as long as the pressure is maintained in the reaction vessel by the component gases and that the amount of hydrogen is not so great as to substantially reduce the unsaturated starting material. The rhodium catalyst as later described is necessary in the hydroformylation reaction in that it has been found that the use of the more conventional cobalt catalyst results in a substantial amount of crosslinking gelation. It is beleived that the gelation is due to the coproduction of polyhemiacetals and polyacetals in competition with the production of the hydroformylated alcohol. It was at first beleived by the author that it would be necessary, even with a rhodium catalyst, to employ the ester of the unsaturated alcohol e.g. oleyl acetate to avoid the unwanted by products. Of course the ester is more expensive and eventually is converted to the alcohol in any event. Higher yields of product are obtained through the use the rhodium catalysts than if a cobalt catalyst is employed. It has also been observed that a much higher degree of isomerization of the double bond occurs with a cobalt catalyst than with a rhodium catalyst. The temperature during the hydroformylation is conveniently from about 90 degrees to about 170 degreesC, preferably from about 110 degrees C to about 130 degrees C. Above the higher temperatures listed above increased amounts of unwanted byproducts are formed in the reaction mixture. The pressure conditions are such that the pressure in sealed system is maintained at from about 20 to about 500 atmospheres, preferably from about 30 to about 100 atmospheres absolute during the hydroformylation. The prferred end product obtained from conducting the foregoing process is 9 10 formyl octadecanol when the starting material is oleyl alcohol. The positioning of the 9 10 indicates that the product obtained is a mixture of the 9 and 10 isomer with respect to the formyl group.One additional reason for. using a rhodium catalyst is that if a cobalt catalyst were employed a considerable amount of terminal aldehyde would be formed due to bond migration prior to the addition of the formyl group. When the terminal aldehyde group is formed the resultant alcohol obtained by carrying Out the remainder of the herein described process is unsuitable for many of the purposes that the geminal alcohols may be utilized for. It should also be appreciated that if 9,12linoleyl alcohol is the starting material then the formyl alcohol so formed will be a 9 10 , 12 13 diformyloctadecanol. That is, the end product obtained here will actually be a mixture of the 9 12,9 13J10 12,10 13 diformyl alcohols. Similarly without discussing all the particular isomers present when 9,12,15 linolenyl alcohol is employed the product so obtained will be a mixture of the 9 10 , 12 13 , 15 16 triformyloctadecanol isomers. t is particularly desirable that the expensive rhodium catalyst is recovered. This may be conveniently done by distillation of the formyl alcohol leaving the rhodium in the residue. What is particularly suprising is that the rhodium can be recovered from the distillate in that the art would predict that when hydroformylating an unsaturated alcohol that the products obtained would include considerable quantities of polyhemiacetals and polyacetals as a portion or all of the reaction product and that these products would not be recoverable by distillation. Thus not only is the desired end product achieved in a high degree of purity and yield through the use of the rhodium catalyst but the rhodium catalyst is recoverable in extremely high quantities from the reaction mixture. It should also be emphasized that if the polyhemiacetals and polyketals were formed in the reaction mixture that it is very likely that the reaction components would undergo a great change in viscosity to the point of forming a semi solid product due to the extensive cross linking of the acetal and ketal linkages. Thus a substantial reason exists for avoiding the polyhemiacetal and polyacetal formation through the use of a rhodium catalyst. It may be stated that the polyacetal and polyhemiacetal formation might be prevented by the utilization, of the corresponding unsaturated acid or its ester in place of the unsaturated alcohol. However, this substitution which eventually involves the acid ester is undesirable in that an aqueous neutralization step is required which forms a soap as a byproduct.The soap so formed then emulsifies the reaction products and the water present to make separation extremely difficult thus diminishing recovery of both the alcohol and the expensive catalyst. Thus the present invention is highly selective to both unsaturated alcohol and the particular rhodium catalyst so employed. Any convenient source of rhodium may be employed as in the present reaction mixture the rhodium catalyst is actually convented through the presence of the hydrogen and carbon monoxide into its active form which is a rhodium carbonyl hydride. Conveniently the source of rhodium for use in the rhodium catalyst may be rhodium metal, rhodium oxide, and various other rhodium salts such as rhodium chloride, rhodium dicarbonyl chloride dimer, rhodium nitrate, rhodium trichloride and other similar materials. The rhodium catalyst in the present hydroformylat ion reaction is preferably present with a ligand such as a trisubstituted phosphine or trisubstituted phosphite.The term trisubstituted includes both alkyl and aryl compounds and the substituted compounds of the alkyl and aryl cQmpounds. A particularly valuable ligand for the rhodium carbonyl hydride is triphenylphosphite or triphenylphosphine in that both compounds are particularly useful minimizing migration of the double bond thereby avoiding a large number of isomers with respect to the formyl group including the undesired terminal formyl compound as previously discussed. In general triaryl phosphines or triarylphosphites may be used for this purpose in the formation of the rhodium carbonyl hydride ligand. In addition, the foregoing materials are extremely valuable in minimizing the undesired reaction of saturation of the double bond or the reduction formyl group.This frequently occurs in the absence of such ligands because the rhodium catalyst functions excellently as a hydrogenation catalyst. That is the ligand tends to eliminate such side reactions. In general anyone of several other additional ligands may be used with the rhodium catalyst. Such additional ligands are discussed in the Selective Hydroformylation of Unsaturated Fatty Acid Esters by Frankel in the Annals N.Y. Academy of Sciences 214 79 1973 . The various ligands are conveniently employed in mole ratio to the rhodium metal content of the catalyst of from about 2 to 50 preferably from about 3 to 20. The rhodium catalyst based upon its metal content is conveniently employed in catalytic amounts preferably from about 22 ppm to about 10,000 ppm, most preferably from about 50 ppm to about 500 ppmby weight of the unsaturated alcohol. The various formyl alcohols are useful as previously stated in preparing the highly desired gem bis hydroxymethyl alcohols. The alcohols may be formed from the foregoing formly alcohols via a Tollens reaction aldol condensation followed by a crossed Cannizzaro reaction . Schematically the Tollens reaction is as described below.weak base RCH CHO R HCHO EMI19.1 RC CHO CH2OH R A A HCHO MOHEMI19.2 RC CH2OH 2R HC02M wherein the above formula R indicates an organic moiety, compound A is a hydroxymethyl aldehyde and MOH is a strong base. The Tollens reaction is thus carried out by reacting one mole of a monoformylated alcohol with two moles of formaldehyde in an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen. Where the formyl alcohol contains more than one formyl group, two moles of formaldehydes are required for each formyl group present. Thus if the reactant is formyloctadecanol then, two moles of formaldehyde are required for conversion to the gem bis hydrcxymethyl alcohol whereas if linoleyl acohol is utilized in the first instance to give a diformyloctadecanol then four moles of formaldehyde are required to obtain the digeminaloctadecanol. Conveniently an excess of up to 1.5 preferably up to 1.2 times the amount of formaldehyde actually required to form the corresponding gem bis hydroxymethyl alcohol is employed in the present invention.A convenient manner of adding the formaldehyde in theTollens reaction is by using a methanol solution of formaldehyde. The Tollens reaction utilizes a strong base as both a reactant and a catalyst. Such strong bases include sodium, potassium or calcium hydroxide. Other strong bases such as carbonates or other hydroxides may be used as well.The strong base is conveniently employed on an equivalent basis per formyl group to convert the formyl group to the hydroxy methyl group. The amount of base required in the Tollens reaction is at least an equivalent of that required preferably up to 1.5, most preferably up to 1.2 equivalents. The Tollens reaction is conducted at a temperature of from about 0 degrees C to about 100 degrees Cf preferably from about 20 degrees C to about 70 degrees C. The crude gem bis hydroxymethyl alcohol so formed is washed with water to remove any excess caustic and salts formed and then obtained in a relatively pure state by vacuum drying. In obtaining the qembis hydroxymethyl ,alcohol of the present invention the crossed Cannizzaro reaction predominates over the rate of reaction for the simpleCannizzaro reaction. The Cannizzaro reaction which is promoted by base, water, and heat is the process by which an aldehyde reacts with itself to form the corresponding alcohol and formate salt. That is, in the present invention the formyl group on the formyl alcohol reacts faster with formaldehyde to give the alcohol than does the formaldehyde react with itself. It is also surprising that the formation of hemiacetal which may be acid or base catalyzed does not occur upon the addition of base to the formyl alcohol while forming the intermediate hydroxymethyl formyl alcohol. Thus two potential side reactions, the Cannizzaro and the hemiacetal formation and thereafter the acetal which might be expected given the reactants and the processing conditions involved do not in fact occur and the useful alcohol is obtained in substantial quantities. It has been found, however, in the present invention that the more complicated crossed Cannizzaro surprisingly predominates in rate and amount of product gembis hydroxymethyl alcohol produced despite the steric hinderance of the larger formyl alcohol molecule even under conditions which are known to promote the simple Cannizzaro reaction. An alternative method of accomplishing the formation of the geminal alcohol is to use only about one half the equivalent amount of the formaldehyde required in the Tollens reaction thereby forming the corresponding hydroxymethyl formyl alcohol via the aldol condensation.That is, the hydroxymethyl group is attached to the carbon in the alpha position to the formyl group. Where a polyformyl alcohol is the intermediate product the formaldehyde is halved from that utilized in the Tollens reaction to give the corresponding polyhydroxymethyl polyformyl alcohol. This variation of forming the geminal alcohol eliminates the need for the strong base required in theTollens reaction and utilizes instead only catalytic amounts of base which may be either a weak or strong base.A preferred weak base is triethylamine. Even here some care must be taken as it is possible even when using a weak base to obtain compound A as the Cannizzaro reaction may compete with the aldol condensation. The hydroxymethyl formyl alcohol so formed by this alternative route is then reduced to the alcohol conveniently by using hydrogen gas and a suitable hydrogenation catalyst such as copper chromite, or nickel, via conventional hydrogenation practice or by lithium aluminum hydride production. S. significant advantage to the alternative route is the absence of large amounts of salt and solvents needed in the Tollens reaction route. A distinct advantage in the geminal alcohol of the present invention is that it is a liquid at room temperature and further has no tertiary hydrogens which are a weak point for chemical attack on the molecule. A mixture of the diol and the geminal alcohol may be obtained by reacting the unsaturated alcohol to obtain the corresponding formyl alcohol. Thereafter the formyl alcohol is split into two streams, the first of which is processed as previously discussed to give the geminal alcohol while the second stream is reduced by hydrogenation to give the diol. The hydrogenation is generally carried out as discussed in the alternative route for preparing the geminal alcohol. The diol and the geminal alcohol are then recombined in the desired proportions which preferably in a weight ratio of from about 2 1 to about 1 100 more preferably from about 1 1 to about 1 75. The preferred value for the sum of h and k is from 14 to 18. The liquid nature of the geminal alcohol aids in solublizing the normally solid diol thus giving a product which is easy to compound. The products of the present invention are useful in preparing polyurethanes. Among the products which may be obtained from the alcohols are rigid foams and thermosetting elastomers. Additional uses of the gem bis hydroxymethyl alcohols of the present invention include scalants, polyvinyl alcohol plasticizers, and poly oxy alkylene adducts suchças ethylene and propylene oxide adducts for polyurethanes or detergents. The poly oxy alkylenes and their halogenated derivatives especially chlorinated are particularly useful in polyurethanes.The alcohols formed in the present invention may be reacted with an anionic species to give surfactant products such as the sulfated reaction products of the alcohol. Additional surfactants may be formed by first adducting the alcohol with a poly oxy alkylene such as ethylene or propylene oxide and then adding the sulfate group. The present invention also contemplates the caprolactone adducts of of the alcohols. Further uses of the present invention include microcellular foams, the reaction of the alcohol with materials such as acrylic or methacrylic acids to give radiation curable coatings. The alcohols of the present invention may also be used as lubricants or oil substitutes. A further use of the present alcohol compounds are their formation into glycidyl ethers and their subsequent use as a new type of epoxy coating. A further use of the geminal alcohol is in cosmetic preparations particularly as an emollient. A primary aspect of the present invention, however, is the use of the alcohols so formed as reaction products with isocyanates to form polyurethanes. To form the urethane reaction product of the alcchol a reaction is conducted which requires the presence of an organic polyisocyanate compound. Suitable polyisocyanates include ethylene diisocyanate, trimethylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, propylene l, 3 diisocyanate, ethylidene diisocyanate, cyclopentylene l, 3 diisocyanate, the 1,2 , 1,3 and 1,4icycohexylene diisocyanates, the 1,3 and 1,4 phenylene diisocyanates, polymethylene polyphenyleneisocyanates, the 2,4 and 2,6 toluene diisocyanates, the 1,3 and 1,4 xylylene diisocyanates, bis 4 isocyanatophenyl methane, 4,4 diphenyl propane diisocyanates, bis 2 isocyanatoethyl carbonate, 1, 8 diisocyanato p methane, l methyl 2, 4 diisocyanato cyclohexane, the chlorophenylene diisocyanates, naphthalene l, 5 diisocyanate triphenylmethane 4,4 , triisocyanate, isopropylbenzene alpha 4 diisocyanate, 5,6 bicyclo 2.2.1 hept 2 ene diisocyanate, 5t6 disocyanatobutylbicyclo 2.2.1 hept 2 ene and similar polyisocyanates. Of particular interest in the present invention are trimethylene hexamethyl diisocyanate available from VEBA, heptadecyl C17 diisocyanate, DDI 1410 an aliphatic C 36 diisocyanate available from the HenkelCorporation of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Generally diisocyanates having from 12 to 40 carbons in the aliphatic radical may be used in the present invention , toluene diisocyanate available from Allied Chemical, isophorone diisocyanate available from VEBA and Desmodur N an aliphatic triisocyanate available from Mobay. Desmodur N is more particularly defined the tri isocyanate adduct of 3 moles of hexamethylene diisocyanate and water having an isocyanate equivalent weight as later defined of 191 grams. either adducts or prepolymers of the polyisocyanate include Desmodur L and Mondur CB which are the adducts of toluene diisocyanate.The foregoing materials have an isocyanate equivalent weight of approximately 250 grams. The amount of the polyisocyanate utilized in forming the urethane compositions of the present invention is expressed on a percentage equivalent weight basis with respect to the hydroxyl functionality of the alcohol.Desirably each hydroxyl functional group on the alcohol will react on a 1 1 stoichiometric basis with the isocyanate functionality on the polyisocyanate compound. It is quite feasible, however, to form the urethane linkage using from about 80 to 1208 preferably from about 95 to 105 on a hydroxyl isocyanate equivalent basis of the polyisocyanate to form the urethane product. To determine the amount of the polyisocyanate required for a given saturated polyol the hydroxyl or isocyanate equivalent weight of the respective polyol or polyisocyanate is determined as that weight in grams of the material which contains 1 gram equivalent weight of the respective functional group. More particularly to determine the number of equivalents in a given saturated polyol the hydroxyl value is first determined by known methods and reported in milligrams of potassium hydroxide. The calculation to determine the hydroxyl equivalents is then given by the following equation OH equivalent weight 56,100 OH value where 56,100 is the milligram equivalent weight of potassium hydroxide. Alternatively if the weight percentage of the hydroxyl groups in the saturated polyol is known the hydroxyl equivalent is determined as follows OH equivalent weight ,17 x 100 wt OH where 17 is the equivalent weight of the hydroxyl radical and the weight percent OH is the percentage of the saturated polyol which is hydroxyl groups. In similar fashion the isocyanate equivalent may be determined if the weight percent of the isocyanate fuctional groups in the polyisocyanate is known. This equation is given below where 42 is the molecular weight of an isocyanate functional group and the weight percentNCO is that portion of polyisocyanate made up of isocyanate functional groups. 42 equivalent weight 42 x 100 isocyanate equivalent weight wt 100 To form the urethane reaction product the alcohol of the present invention and the organic polyisocyanate are merely mixed together in the proper proportions. When utilized as a coating the compounds are then quickly spread with a knife blade brush or spray over the surface of the article to be coated. Where molded articles are desired various techniques such as reaction injection moulding may be used. Specific techniques for forming uret hane reaction products are hereinafter described in the examples. If desired various urethane catalysts may be employed to promote the reaction. Examples of such, urethane catalysts include triethylene diamine, morpholine, N ethyl morpolinet dimethyl piperazine, triethylamine, N,N,N , N tetramethylbutane l, 3 diamine, dibutyl tin dilaurate, stannous octoate, stannous laurate, dioctyl tin diacetate, lead octoate, stannous oleate, stannous tallate, dibutyl tin oxide, and hexabutyl di tin as well as other art recognized urethane catalysts.Typical levels of the urethane catalyst are from about 0.0018 to about 5 by weight of the urethane linking components. An additional polyol may be included with the alcohols of the the present invention. Such polyols may be an alkyl or cycloalkyl polyol, an ester linked polyol, an ether linked polyol, an ether and ester linked polyol or hydroxy functional acrylic copolymers. Specific examples of alkyl and cycloalkyl polyols include 2,5 hexanediol available from AldrichChemical, 1,6 hexanediol, available from Celanese Chemical, ethylene glycol available from Baker, Dimerol a 36 carbon essentially linear diol available from GeneralMills Chemicals, Inc., glycerol, 1,2 6 hexanetriol available from Union Carbide, pentaerythritol, and 1,4 cyclohexane diol. Additional examoles of such polyols includePolybd R 45T a Butadiene diol having an approximate molecular weight of 2800 available from Arco and Trimethylol propane available from Celanese. The ester lunked saturated diols ot the present invention are more particularly described as polyols where the predominate linkage functional group other than the hydroxy are ester radicals. The ester linked saturated polyols are structurally represented asEMI26.1 where R and R are organic residues which contain art least two hydroxyl radicals and at least one ester link. Examples of ester linked saturated polyols include Niax PCP0200 and PCP0240 both available from Union Carbide and having respective molecular weights of approximately 530 and 2000. Both of the foregoing compounds are diols. Niax PCP0300 also available from Union Carbide is a Caprolactone ester triol having approximate molecular weight of 540. Niax PCP0310 also available from UnionCarbide is a Caprolactone ester triol having a molecular weight of approximately 900. The ether linked saturated polyols of the present invention include compounds such as diethylene glycol and triethylene glycol both available from Fisher.Further ether linked saturated polyols useful in the present invention include the Polymeg Q0650, Q0100, andQ0200 all of which are ether diols available from Quaker having a respective molecular weight of approximately 650, 1000 and 2000. Pluarcol P1O1C having an approximate molecular weight of. 1050 available from IJyandotte is an example of a polypropylene oxide ether linked diol useful in the present invention.Similar Wyandotte products useful as saturated polyols in the present invention include Pluracol TP440 and 150 which are propylene oxide ether linked triols having respective molecular weights of approximately 425 and 1560. In similar fashionPluaracol GP3030 is another saturated polyol suitable for the present invention availanle from Wyandotte. The foregoing material is a glycerine polypropylene ether linked triol having an approximate molecular weight of 2900. Additional Pluracols useful in the present invention include Pluarcol PEP450 which is pentaerythritol polypropylene oxide ether linked tetrol having a molecular weight of 405 and Pluracol 493 an ether linked tetrol having a molecular weight of approximately 3630. Ester and ether linked saturated polyols suitable in the present invention are described structurally asEMI27.1 where R, R and R are organic residues containing at least two hydroxyl radicals and at least one ester and one ether linkage. The following exemplify the present invention. EXAMPLE 1 The manufacture of the formyloctadecanol according to the present invention may be accomplished by charging a liter Magne Drive, 316 SS autoclave with 606 grams 2.26 moles of oleyl alcohol, 3.01 grams of 5 rhodium on alumina and 3 grams 9.68 moles of triphenylphosphite. The autoclave is sealed and pressurized to 10 atmospheres with nitrogen under stirring and then vented to atmospheric pressure. The nitrogen purge is repeated twice more to ensure removal of any oxygen present in the autoclave. The autoclave is then pressurized a third time with premixed carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas in a 1 to 1 molar ratio to 68 atmospheres at which point heating is started. Stirring is manually controlled at 1250 rps and the uptake of the mixture of the gases starts at about 100 degrees C. The reaction conditions are then maintained at a temperature of 130 degrees C and the gas pressure at 70 to 75 atmospheres. The reaction is substantially complete after 4.6 hours and is determined by the cessation of the gas uptake. The confirmation of completeness of the reaction is obtained by sampling the mixture and determining through gas chromatograph analysis that there is less than 1 of the starting alcohol in the mixture. The reaction mixture is then cooled to 75 degrees C, vented to atmospheric pressure and purged twice with nitrogen. The contents of the autoclave are then discharged at 75 degrees C under nitrogen pressure through a pressure filter. The yield of the formyloctadecanol is greater than 90 . Atomic absorption analysis of the filtered product showed 244 ppm of rhodium. The reaction may be modified by using triphenylphosphine in place of the triphenylphosphite. Alternatively the oleyl alcohol may be substituted for by linoleyl or linolenyl alcohol. The reaction temperature may also be lowered to 90 degrees C at which point the reaction takes a substantially longer period of time to proceed. As a second alternative the reaction temperature can be raised to about 170 degrees C and the reaction time considerably lowered. However, some decomposition of the the end product may occur above the 17.0 degree figure so it should not be exceeded. In similar fashion the mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen may be varied as previously described herein and may also be varied between about 20 and 500 atmospheres of pressure. The lower end of the pressure range of course slows the reaction rate down while the higher pressure condition increases the reaction but also increases the probability that some of the starting alcohol will be saturated by the hydrogen. EXAMPLE 11 5.26 moles 1570 grams of the formyloctadecanol obtained from Example I is charged into a 5 liter glass round bottom reaction flask equipped with a heat exchanger coil, thermocouple, stirrer, addition inlet, reflux condensor and combination glass electrode. A further reaction charge of 695 grams 12.87 moles of a 55.6 formaldehyde in methanol solution is added under a nitrogen blanket. A 40 solution of sodium hydroxide is made by dissolving 245.7 grams 5.95 moles of sodium hydroxide in 368 grams of water under a nitrogen blanket. The caustic solution is added to a charge tank and connected to the feed side of a metering pump. The reaction mixture is heated to 30 degreesC and the caustic carefully added by means of a metering pump with stirring to adjust the pH to about 10.9. After about forty minutes at 30 degrees C the addition of the 40 caustic solution is started at a rate of 9.65 milliliters per minute and the temperature of the reaction is increased to 60 degrees C. The addition of caustic required about 45 minutes and the reaction temperature was maintained at 60 degrees C. Gas chromatograph analysis of a sample taken at this time indicated that the reaction was complete and that the gem bis hydroxymethyl alcohol corresponding to the formyloctadecanol is formed. The reaction is held for an additional 20 minutes at 60 degrees C. Gas chromatograph analysis of a sample taken at this time indicated that the reaction was complete and that the gem bis hydroxymethyl alcohol corresponding to the formyloctadecanol is formed. The reaction is held for an additional 20 minutes at 60 degrees C after completion of the caustic addition. The stirring is then stopped and the lower aqueous phase 816 grams was allowed to separate. After washing of the crude gem bis hydroxymethyl octadecanol and its drying vacuum the amount recovered is 1711 grams corresponding to a yield of greater than 90 . Alternatively linoleyl or linolenyl alcohol derivatives of Example 1may be employed under similar conditions. The reaction temperature for the production of the bishydroxymethyloctadecanol may also be conveniently varied between 0 degrees C and 100 degrees C as previously discussed. An alternative method of obtaining the bishydroxymethyloctadecanol is to use 6.43 moles of the 55.6 formaldehyde solution thereby yielding the corresponding hydroxymethyl formyloctadecanol as an isolatableproduct. This material is then reduced through catalytic hydrogenation with copper chromite or through the use of lithium aluminum hydride to give the gem bis hydroxy methyl octadecanol. EXAMPLE III A polyurethane casting is prepared by reacting 58 parts of the 9,9 10,10 bis hydroxymethyl octadecanol with 59 parts of isophorone diisocyanate. The mixture is warmed slightly to promote homogeneity. A small portion of dibutyl tin dilaurate .46 parts is added to the foregoing mixture with rapid stirring whereupon the mixture sets into a clear, colorless, hard solid in about one minure. A distinct advantage in the products of the present invention is that they tend to cure into clear, colorless solids. EXAMPLE IV A one shot elastomer is prepared by combining 9,9 10,10 bis hydroxymethyl octadecanol and 9 10 hydroxymethyl octadecanol 9 1 r,atio and a 10 stoichiometric excess of an 80 20 mixture of 2,4 tolylene diisocyanate and 2,6 tolylene diisocyanate for two minutes at room temperature during which time the exothermic reaction raises the temperature to 100 degrees, C. At this time the product is poured into a mold and is cured for sixteen hours at 100 degrees C. This product was found to be an extremely hard material having a Shore D hardness of 82 and is a crystal clear solid having a great impact resistance. Substantially similar results may be obtained in the above reaction by substituting the higher molecular weight gem bis hydroxymethyl alcohols previously described at the above proportions with the 9 10 hydroxymethyl octadecanol. EXAMPLE V A polyurethane elastomer of the present invention is produced from a mixture comprising 90E by weight of 9,9 10,10 bis hydroxymethyl octadecanol and 10 by weight of 9 10 hydroxymethyl octadecanol through reaction with a 10 stoichiometric excess of isophorone diisocyanate for one hour at 80 degrees C followed by pouring the reaction mixture into a mould. The molded specimen is further cured for sixteen hours at 100 degrees C and thereafter removed from the mold. The polyurethane elastomer so obtained is extremely hard having a Shore D hardness of 76 and appears as a crystal clear solid which did not fracture upon striking soundly with a hammer. Substantially similar results may be obtained in the above reaction by substituting the higher molecular weight gem bis hydroxymethyl alcohols previously described at the above proportions with the 9 10 hydroxymethyl octadecanol.
