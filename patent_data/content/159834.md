# An internal combustion engine and a method of operating the engine.

## Abstract
An internal combustion engine, and a method of operating an internal combustion engine, of the kind in which recycled exhaust gases are reacted with a hydrocarbon fuel in a com bustion space 1C to produce a reformed fuel of enhanced calorific value by cracking molecules of the hydrocarbon fuel, the invention providing for means 14, 17 for the supply of air to the combustion space 1C in the cylinder 1B and separate means 15, 16 for the supply of the cracked and reformed fuel enabling an efficient engine operation to be achieved with eco nomical use of fuel.
