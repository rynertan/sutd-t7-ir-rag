# Method of pressurizing treatment of pre foamed particles of polyolefin resin.

## Abstract
A method for pressurizing pre foamed particles of a polyolefin resin by maintaining the pre foamed particles in an atmosphere of a pressurized gas to impart a predetermined internal pressure thereto, which comprises first maintaining the particles under a pressure which does not cause shrinkage to the particles, and then increasing the applied pressure gradually under conditions which do not cause shrinkage to the particles.
