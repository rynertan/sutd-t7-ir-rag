# Digital apparatus approximating multiplication of analog signal by sine wave signal and method.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus are disclosed which employ digital techniques to approximate a multiplication of an anlog signal by a sine wave signal of an appropriate frequency. The analog signal is converted by an analog to digital converter 30 to a digital representation which includes a sign bit 34 and a plurality of magnitude bits 35 40 . The sign bit of the digital representation is selectively complemented by an inverting logic gate 44 which is controlled by a square wave signal 42 having the appropriate frequency of the sine wave signal which is being approximated. The selective com plementation of the sign bit of the digital representation func tions to multiply the digital representation by 1 or 1 as determined by the status of the square wave signal. The resulting digital representation is stored in a latch 48 at periodic intervals for further processing of the digital rep resentation which results from the quasi digital multiplica tion.
