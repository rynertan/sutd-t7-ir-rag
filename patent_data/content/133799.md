## Description
The present invention relates to a tuning system for use in transmitters and receivers in radio, television, stereo tuners, and personal radio communications, and other commumication equipment. As more and more waves are used in radio and television broadcasting and communications, tuning systems for selecting the frequencies of waves to be recieved are required to be highly stable and reliable in their performance. There has also been a great demand for the reduction of the cost of manufacture of receivers, transmitters and other communication equipment in which the tuning systems are installed. In particular, the development of a new technology is desired for tuning system circuit components in radio frequency stages which have been difficult to improve. Conventional tuning systems will be described with reference to the drawings. FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings shows a basic circuit arrangement of a tuning oscillator device. The tuning oscillator comprises a tuning circuit 4 composed of a tuning inductor 1, a variable capacitor 2, and a fixed capacitor 3. To the tuning circuit 4, there is connected an input terminal or output terminal 6 of a feedback amplifier 5. FIG. 2 illustrates another circuit arrangement of a conventional tuning amplifier device, which comprises a tuning circuit 10 composed of a tuning inductor 7, a variable capacitor 8, and a fixed capacitor 9. A signal applied to an input terminal 11 is amplified by an amplifier 12 which supplies an amplified output through an output terminal 13 to the tuning circuit 10. FIG. 3 shows a circuit arrangement of a conventional mixer device including a tuning circuit 16 comprising a tuning inductor 14 and a fixed capacitor 15. A mixer 9 has a first input terminal 17, a second input terminal 18, and an intermediate frequency output terminal 20 connected to the tuning circuit 16. FIG. 4 shows conventional components of which the tuning circuits 4, 10, 16 shown in FIGS. 1 through 3 are composed. The components include a tuning inductor 21, a variable capacitor 22, and a fixed capacitor 23 which are interconnected by circuit conductors 24, 25. However, the conventional arrangements have been subjected to the following disadvantages The tuning system arrangement shown in FIG. 4 has other drawbacks. The inductor and the capacitor are constructed as separate components that are interconnected by long conductors. The long conductors tend to produce unwanted lead inductances and stray capacitances which cause the tuning circuit to operate unstably and make it difficult to achieve an initial design target. Accordingly, no sufficient frequency selectivity can be ensured, and undesired resonant conditions are produced at uncertain frequencies, with the consequence that no tuning systems of desired design can be achieved. This invites abnormal oscillation, oscillation of unwanted signals, increased higher harmonics in oscillated signals, resulting increased distortions, and a narrowed width in which a variable tuning oscillation frequency varies. Furthermore, no sufficient frequency selectivity can be ensured, and undesired resonant conditions are produced at uncertain frequencies, with the consequence that no tuning amplifiers of desired design can be achieved. This invites abnormal oscillation, response of unwanted signals, increased higher harmonics in amplified signals, resulting increased distortions, a narrowed width in which a variable tuning oscillation frequency varies, and deterioration in abilities to remove intermodulation interference and spurious interference. Also, no sufficient frequency selectivity can be ensured, and undesired resonant conditions are produced at uncertain frequencies, with the consequence that no intermediate frequency tuning circuits of desired design can be achieved. This invites abnormal oscillation, generation of spurious signals, increased distortions caused by increased higher harmonics in intermediate frequency signals, and deterioration in abilities to remove intermodulation interference and spurious interference. In an article entitled A linear voltage controlled oscillator by J. Dearden in Electronic Engineering, vol. 55, no. 678, June 1983, a design for such an oscillator is described. In the circuit a loose coupling between a primary oscillator and an output amplifier is provided by a pair of coupled inductances, In U.S. patent 3243742 a variable frequency resonator is described. This comprises two flat conductive electrodes which are preferably generally circular and have defined cut out portions and which are placed on either side of a flat dielectric material. Tuning is performed by rotation of one electrode with respect to the other, as the rotation varies the areas of the electrodes which directly face each other across the dielectric. Since known tuning circuits are composed of discrete components having minimum unit functions, there is a limitation on efforts to reduce the number of parts used and improve the manufacturing process. The present invention provides tuning system comprising An advantage of the present invention is the provision of a tuning circuit which is composed of an integral construction of inductor and capacitor components, and which enables apparatus into which it is incorporated to be low in profile, small in size, stable and highly accurate in operation against variations in ambient conditions such as mechanical vibrations and temperature variations, and stable in operation at high frequencies without suffering from adverse influences by connector leads in the tuning circuit. Examples of apparatus into which such a tuning circuit may be incorporated are a tuning oscillator, a tuning amplifier or a mixer device. A further advantage of the present invention is the provision of a tuning system having a tuning circuit as outlined above which has a reduced number of components so that the tuning system can be manufactured by an improved process, the tuning system being capable of trimming a tuning frequency through a simple adjustment procedure and improving the stability of the trimmed tuning frequency. One or a plurality of such resonant circuits according to this invention may be provided, and the tuning frequency of the or each resonant circuit may be trimmed by cutting off the electrodes of the or each resonant circuit or connecting ground terminals to the electrodes. The above functional circuits may be connected directly or through other circuit components. The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which preferred embodiments of the present invention are shown by way of illustrative example.

The mixer device 337 may comprise one illustrated in FIG. 10, 11, or 23 through 27. The tuning circuits 23, 33, 43, 48, 54, 58, 72, 79, 80, 81, 97, 112, and 129 in the tuning systems in the embodiments shown in FIGS. 5 through 14 will be described hereinbelow. FIGS. 29 a , 29 b and 29 c through 32 a , 32 b and 32 c illustrate the constructions of tuning circuits according to embodiments of the present invention. In FIGS. 29 a , 29 b and 29 c , a dielectric 339 in the form of a plate is made of ceramic and supports an electrode 340 forming an inductor on a surface of the dielectric 339 and another electrode 341 disposed on an opposite surface of the dielectric 339 in confronting relation to the electrode 340. The electrodes 340, 341 jointly form a distributed constant circuit forming a capacitor. The electrode 340 includes a ground terminal 340a and an open terminal 340b, and the electrode 341 includes a ground terminal 341a and an open terminal 341b which are opposite to the terminals 340b, 340a, respectively. Each of the electrodes 340, 341 has one bent portion having a desired bent angle and direction. In FIGS. 30 a through 30 c , electrodes 343, 344 are mounted on opposite surfaces of a dielectric 342 in the from of a plate, and in FIGS. 31 a through 32 c , electrodes 346, 347 are mounted on opposite surfaces of a dielectric 345 in the from of a plate. As illustrated in FIGs. 30 a through 30 c and 31 a through 31 c , the electrodes are mounted on the dielectrics and have a terminal arrangement in the same manner as described with reference to the embodiment of FIGS. 29 a through 29 c . However, each of the electrodes has more than one bent portion having a desired bent angle and direction. In FIGS. 32 a through 32 c , electrodes 349, 350 are mounted on opposite surfaces of a dielectric 348 in the from of a plate. The electrodes are mounted on the dielectrics and have a terminal arrangement in the same manner as described with reference to the embodiment of FIGS. 29 a through 29 c . However, each of the electrodes has a spiral configuration. Although in the embodiments shown in FIGS. 29 a , 29 b and 29 c through 32 a , 32 b and 32 c each electrode has a bent portion formed as an angular pattern having a desired bent angle, the electrode may instead have a bent portion formed as an arcuate pattern having a desired curvature. FIGS. 33 a and 33 b show the construction of a tuning circuit according to another embodiment of the present invention. A tubular dielectric 351 supports an electrode 352 on an inner peripheral surface thereof and an electrode 353 on an outer peripheral surface thereof, the electrodes 352, 353 extending in confronting relation to each other. The electrodes 352, 353 have ground terminals located at opposite ends thereof. The dielectric 351 may be in the form of a hollow structure having a rectangular cross section. The terminals that are designated as ground terminals in the foregoing embodiments may not be used as ground terminals but may serve as general common terminals for connection to other circuits not shown . The tuning circuits shown in FIGS. 29 a , 29 b and 29 c through 32 a , 32 b and 32 c can form relatively large distributed inductors and capacitors though they take up small areas. Therefore, small tuning circuits having relatively low tuning frequencies can be achieved with a resulting increased space factor. The tuning circuit shown in FIGS. 33 a and 33 b is smaller in size than the tuning circuits shown in FIGS. 29 a , 29 b and 29 c through 32 a , 32 b and 32 c , but can form a sufficient larger inductor and capacitor. Therefore, a much smaller tuning circuit having a sufficiently tuning frequency can be accomplished. The tuning circuit of FIGS. 33 a and 33 b can be mass produced with ease by continuously forming electrodes 352, 353 on an elongate continuous tubular dielectric 351 and then cutting off the tubular dielectric 351 to desired lengths. The electrodes, or transmission line electrodes, in the foregoing embodiments may be constructed of a metal conductor, a printed metal foil conductor, a printed thick film conductor, or a thin film conductor, or may comprise a combination of these conductors. The dielectric may be made of alumina ceramic, barium titanate, plastics, Teflon trademark , glass, mica, or in the form of a printed circuit board of resin base. The balanced tuning circuits 149, 160, 172, 184, 197, 209, 222, 232, 235, 255, 268, 282, 297, 306, 312, and 315 in the balanced tuning systems in the embodiments shown in FIGS. 15 through 27 will be described hereinbelow. FIGS. 34 a , 34 b and 34 c and 35 a , 35 b and 35 c are illustrative of the balanced tuning circuit for use in the balanced tuning systems shown in FIGS. 15, 18, 19, 22, 23, 26, 27, and also of the construction of main and auxiliary electrodes and a dielectric for the balanced tuning circuits shown in FIGS. 31 and 32.. In FIGS. 34 a through 34 c , the tuning circuit has a dielectric base plate or substrate 354 and electrodes 355, 356 forming a distributed constant circuit providing a distributed inductor and a distributed capacitor. The electrodes 355, 356 have ground terminals positioned remotely from each other between the confronting electrodes as shown in FIGS. 34 a through 34 c . The ground terminals in FIGS. 35 a through 35 c are similarly arranged. Sides A, B shown in FIG. 34 a correspond respectively to sides A, B in FIG. 34 c This also holds true in FIGS. 35 a through 35 c . In FIGS. 34 a through 34 c , the electrodes 355, 356 of a meandering configuration are disposed in confronting relation to each other with the dielectric substrate 354 interposed therebetween. In FIGS. 35 a through 35 c , electrodes 360, 361 of a spiral configuration are disposed in confronting relation to each other with a dielectric substrate 337 interposed therebetween. While in the embodiments of FIGS. 34 a through 34 c and 35 a through 35 c the electrodes disposed in confronting or juxtaposed relation are of the same shape and fully confront each other over their entire surfaces, one of the electrodes may have a different equivalent length than that of the other electrode, or the companion electrodes may confront each other only partially. Designated in FIGS. 34 a through 34 c and 35 a through 35 c at 357, 358, 362, 363 are balanced terminals. Operation of the tuning circuit for the tuning system in each of the foregoing embodiments will now be described. FIGS. 36 a through 36 e are circuit diagrams of equivalent circuits of the tuning circuit of the present invention. In FIG. 36 a , transmission lines are composed of transmission line electrodes 364, 365 having an electrical length ℓ and including ground terminals disposed at opposite ends. A signal source 366 for generating a voltage e is connected to the transmission line electrode 364 for supplying a signal thereto. When the signal is applied, a traveling wave voltage e With the ground terminals of the transmission line electrodes 364, 365 being disposed in opposite relation or remotely from each other, the induced traveling wave voltage e A potential difference V between any desired confronting portions of the transmission line electrodes 364, 365 is expressed by Therefore, the potential difference V can be generated between all confronting portions of the transmission line electrodes 364, 365. It is assumed here that the transmission line electrodes 364, 365 have a width W with their thickness being small and are spaced a distance d from each other by a dielectric having a dielectric constant ε Therefore, Now, the relationship between the formation of the distributed capacitor 367 and the electrical length ℓ of the transmission lines will be described. A characteristic impedance Z If the transmission lines cause no loss, This assumption can be applied to many of the resonator filters according to the embodiments of the invention. For the sake of brevity, the characteristic impedance Z An equivalent reactance X at a terminal of a transmission line having a characteristic impedance Z Therefore, any desired capacitance C can be achieved by varying ϑ or selecting the electrical length ℓ of the tranmission line. FIG. 38 is illustrative of the mode of operation of the transmission lines described with reference to the above equations 9 through 13 . In FIG. 38, the equivalent reactance X generated at the terminals is shown as being varied as the electrical length of the transmission lines with open distal ends varies. As is apparent from FIG. 38, it is possible to form a negative terminal reactance if the electrical length ℓ is λ 4 or below or in the range of from λ 2 to 4λ 3, that is, a capacitor can equivalently be formed. Furthermore, under the condition to form a negative terminal reactance, the capacitance C can be of a desired value by selecting any desired electrical length ℓ of the transmission lines. The capacitor C can be equivalently replaced with a lumped constant capacitor 370 shown in FIG. 36 d . The inductor formed by the total of distributed inductor components present in the transmission lines and lumped inductor components generated by the bending of the transmission lines can be equivalently replaced with a lumped constant inductor 371. By expressing the ground terminals in FIG. 36 d as a common ground terminal, the arrangement can finally be equivalent to a parallel resonant circuit as shown in FIG. 36 e which is composed of a lumped constant capacitor 370 and a lumped constant inductor 371, thus realizing a tuning circuit. The tuning circuit of the invention is realized on the basis of the arrangement and operation described above The construction and principles of operation of the tuning circuit according to the present invention are entirely different from those of the conventional tuning circuits. To indicate that the tuning circuit of the invention differs entirely from a conventional tuning circuit or another tuning circuit arrangement using the same transmission lines as those in the tuning circuit of the invention, the construction and operation of the conventional tuning circuit or the other tuning circuit arrangement using the same transmission lines will hereinafter be described. This will serve to clarify the difference between the tuning circuit of the invention and the conventional tuning circuit and also the novelty of th tuning circuit of the invention. FIG. 39 is illustrative of the circuit arrangement o a quarter wave resonator which has heretofore been used most widely. The illustrated prior resonator is fully different from the tuning circuit of the invention as to the distal ends of the transmission lines, selection of the length thereof, and selection of ground terminals. In FIG. 39, balanced mode transmission line electrodes 372, 373 have an electrical length ℓ equal to λ 4 at a resonance frequency and their distal ends short circuited. The transmission line electrodes are driven in a balanced mode by a balanced signal source 374 which generates a voltage e. A ground terminal is selected to be located at a neutral point of the balanced signal source 374, and no ground terminal is placed at any terminal of the transmission line electrodes. An equivalent terminal reactance X produced at the terminals of the transmission lines is given by FIGS. 40 a through 40 c are illustrative of the construction of a tuning circuit according to still another embodiment of the present invention, as representing the embodiment shown in FIGS. 32 a through 32 c . Electrodes 376, 377 are mounted on opposite surfaces of a dielectric 375 in the form of a plate. The electrodes are mounted on the dielectrics and have a terminal arrangement in the same manner as described with reference to the embodiment of FIGS. 32 a through 32 c . Each of the electrodes has a spiral configuration. If it is desired to adjust the capacitance of the distributed capacitor or the inductance of the distributed inductor, the electrode 377 is cut off at a desired portion 378. The severance of the electrode will be described in greater detail. By cutting off the electrode, a distributed inductor 379 FIG. 41 a is cut off at an electrode portion 380. As a result, the values of a distributed capacitance 381 and the distributed inductance 379 can be varied as desired. FIG. 41 b illustrates the tuning circuit in the form of a lumped constant equivalent circuit which comprises a parallel connected circuit of a variable inductor 382 and a variable capacitor 383. The inductance of the inductor of the tuning circuit can be designed as desired by the number of turns of the spiral electrodes or the length of the spiral electrodes. The capacitance of the distributed capacitor can be designed as desired by the area in which the spiral electrodes confront each other, the dielectric constant and thickness of the dielectric. The formation of the distributed capacitance will be described further with reference to FIG. 42. The confronting spiral electrodes has a transmission line equivalent length ℓ which is designed to be shorter than λ 4 at an operating frequency taking into account a wavelength shortening coefficient 1 ε determined by the dielectric cosntant ε of the dielectric used. By selecting the ratio of the transmission line equivalent length ℓ to the λ 4 as desired, the value of a capacitive reactance Xc can be designed as desired. A capacitance C 1 2 πfo Xc can be determined from the capacitive reactance Xc and the operating frequency f If the transmission line equivalent length ℓ is shortened to a transmission line equivalent length ℓ , the capacitive reactance Xc is changed to a capacitive reactance Xc . A capacitance C 1 2 πfo Xc can be determined from the capacitive reactance Xc and the operating frequency f FIGS. 43, 44, 45 and 46 are illustrative of the manner in which the variable capacitor and the variable inductor of the tuning circuit of FIGS. 40 a through 40 c , as an example, are variably adjusted. FIGS. 43 and 44 are explanatory of a mode for adjusting the variable capacitor by cutting off the capacitor electrode. FIG. 44 shows the relationship between an electrode length d from the open terminal to the cut off position, a distributed capacitance C over the electrode length d, a distributed inductance L over the electrode length d, and a self resonant frequency f The electrode may be cut off by non contant cutter means such as a laser cutter or a sand blaster which does not affect the tuning frequency during cutting operation. With the above embodiment, the inductor electrode an the capacitor electrode are shared by each other and the inductance of the capacitor electrode which is grounded is cancelled out, so that the variable inductor and the variable capacitor are of an integral construction. FIG. 47 shows a tuning system according to an embodiment of the present invention, representing the tuning circuits for adjusting tuning frequencies as described with reference to FIGS. 32 a through 32 c , 40 a through 40 c , and 46. Tuning circuits 385, 386, 387, 388 are scattered on a single layer or multilayer circuit board or substrate 384 the electrodes on the reverse side and intermediate electroes are not shown . The tuning circuits 385, 386 are connected to each other by another circuit element 389, and the tuning circuits 387, 388 are directly connected to each other. The tuning circuits 386, 388 are connected to each other by another circuit element 390. The circuit elements 389, 390 may comprise amplifiers, oscillators, mixers, modulators, demodulators, or detectors. The tuning circuits 385, 386, 387, 388 and the other circuit elements 389, 390 may be positioned at any desired locations on the circuit substrate 384, and as many tuning circuits and other circuit elements as desired may be mounted. The tuning frequencies of the tuning circuits 385 through 388 can independently be adjusted. The electrodes in the tuning circuits 385 through 388 may be formed of metal conductors or printed conductors, and mutually confronting electrodes may be formed of different conductors. The electrodes may be disposed within the circuit substrate, rather than on its surfaces, or may be disposed on an intermediate layer of a multilayer circuit substrate. The circuit substrate 384 may be made of alumina ceramic, plastics, Teflon trademark , glass, or mica, for example. The tuning circuits 385 through 388 which are in the form of metal conductors can be bonded simultaneously to the circuit substrate 384. The tuning circuits 385 through 388 which are in the form of printed conductors can be printed simultaneously on the circuit substrate 384 at the time other circuit patterns are formed thereon. It is possible to connect other variable reactance elements not shown to the tuning circuits 385 through 388 so that the tuning frequencies of the tuning circuits 385 through 388 will be varied in ganged relation. With the present invention, as described above, each tuning circuit is composed of a variable inductor electrode doubling as a variable capacitor electrode, and a variable capacitor electrode, the variable inductor and capacitor electrodes being disposed in adjacent and confronting relation with a common dielectric circuit substrate interposed therebetween, and other circuit elements are formed on the dielectric circuit substrate and connected to the tuning circuits. The tuning frequency of each tuning circuit can be selected as desired by cutting off an electrode or adjusting the position of a ground terminal connected to the electrode. The tuning circuit of the present invention has the following advantages The initial setting values of the variable inductance and the variable capacitance in the tuning circuit are dependent on a simple artwork for an electrode pattern, so that the tuning circuit can be designed with increased freedom and the constants can easily be corrected. Th electrode conductors of the tuning circuit may partially be formed in an intermediate layer of a multilayer circuit substrate, with the result that the packaging of the tuning circuit can be designed with more freedom.
