# A fibre optic connection, a method of making the connection, and a fibre optic cable for use in the connection.

## Abstract
A fibre optic connection comprises two fibre optic cables 19 mounted in ferrules 14 . An optic flbre 22 of each cable 19 extends to an end face of its ferrule 14 . That end face of the ferrule 14 is provided with a concave surface 24 . The ferrules 14 are mounted in a connector body 12 with their end faces in contact. The concave end surfaces 24 automatically ensure that the fibre ends are the correct distance apart.

## Description
A FIBRE OPTIC CONNECTION, A METHOD OF MAKING THE CONNECTION,AND A FIBRE OPTIC CABLE FOR USE IN THE CONNECTION. This invention relates to fibre optic connections. Connectors for fibre optic cables are known. In such connectors, the signal loss across the interface of two optic fibres is a function of the distance between the ends of the fibres. While this distance is optimally kept very small, the fibres should not touch. In order to maintain a close tolerance separation between the adjacent ends of two optic fibres, it has been necessary to maintain very close tolerances on the components of the connector. Such procedures are expensive and lead to Ã…a high rejection rate in finished connectors. The present invention is intended to provide a connection in which the adjacent ends of two optic fibres are maintained in close proximity to one another without touching. In a connection in accordance with the present invention, the interconnected optic fibres are mounted in ferrules. The end of at least one of the ferrules and its optic fibre is polished with a spherical element to form a concave surface. The outer edges of two ferrules abut each other, but the polished faces of the optic fibres will be maintained spaced from one another. For a better understanding of the present invention, and to show how it may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows a fibre optic connection and Figure 2 shows an enlarged detail of the connection of Figure 1. The fibre optic connection of Figure 1 is generally designated by the reference numeral 10. The connection comprises a connector body 12 having an internal bore 13. The bore is dimensioned to receive a ferrule 14 inserted from each end of the connector body 12 and can be rotated to advance each ferrule to the midpoint thereof. A retaining nut 17 holds the connector body securely in an aperture in a wall 20. Each ferrule 14 has an inner bore 18 which is dimensioned to receive a fibre optic cable 19. A forward end 21 of each bore 18 is dimensioned to receive an optic fibre 22 of the cable 19. The cable 19 may be fixed within the inner bore 18 by an adhesive or other suitable means. Turning now to Figure 2, it will be seen that the forward end 23 of each ferrule 14 and the fibre 22 which it contains have been polished with a spherical element so as to form a concave surface 24. It will be appreciated that the two ferrules 14 may be advanced towards one another by the locknuts 15 to bring the flat outer peripheral faces 26 of the ferrules 14 into contact. This contact will maintain the optic fibre ends 27 spaced from one another, at their axes, by a distance which is twice the depth of the concavity of one of the surfaces 24 measured at the axis of the optic fibre. In actual practice, it has been found that a gap of 0.0001 inches 0.025 microns to 0.0008 inches 0.2 microns maintained between the fibre ends is optimum. It will be appreciated that alternative constructions to that illustrated may be used in practising the invention. In some instances, it may be desirable to polish only one ferrule and fibre end with a spherical or other convex element and the other ferrule and fibre end with a flat element. Also, the entire ferrule end may be ground to a concave shape to eliminate completely the flat outer peripheral faces.
