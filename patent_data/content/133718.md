# Inorganic cation exchangers and the process for their preparation.

## Abstract
The inorganic cation exchangers according to the inven tion are constituted by acid phosphates or arsenates of tetravalent metals in solid solution with each other or with part of the phosphate or arsenate groups substituted by phosphite groups. The process for preparing cation exchangers containing phosphite groups comprises reacting in the aqueous phase a compound of a tetravalent metal with one of the following pairs of acids phosphoric phosphorous and arsenic phosphorous. Crystallisation has been obtained by boiling under reflux, by heating in an autoclave to a temperature of less than 300 C, and also by conducting the reaction in the presence of a complexing agent for the tetravalent metal.
