# Multi ratio countershaft transmission.

## Abstract
A stepped ratio countershaft type power transmission pro vides a plurality of drive ratios between an input shaft and an output shaft. The power transmission, in addition to the input and output shafts, has a countershaft 34 on which a plurality of ratio gears 40, 42, 48 are rotatably mounted. The input shaft 14 has at least one ratio gear 22, 24, 26 rotatably mounted thereon, and the output shaft 52 has at least one gear 60, 62, 64 secured thereto, in an arrangement in which a cluster gear is secured to either the input shaft or the output shaft and the other of these shafts has rotatably mounted thereon one or more ratio gears. At least one of the ratio gears on the input shaft serves as an idler gear for one or more of the ratio gears on the countershaft.
