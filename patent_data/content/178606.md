## Description
This invention relates to a molecular controlled structure in which functional molecules are disposed regularly in three dimensional manner and method of producing the same, and more particularly to a molecular controlled structure which may be used for molecular devices etc. We can see the result of researches regarding molecular devices which were conducted so far in various publications such as Proceedings of Molecular Electronic Devices Workshop , Washington, D.C., 23 24 March 1981 and Proceedings of 2nd International Workshop on Molecular Electronic Devices, Washington D.C., 13 15 April 1983 . However, in the past, as concrete examples of method of producing a molecular controlled structure such as molecular devices etc., merely Langmuir Blodgett s technique LB technique and chemical absorption technique CA technique were known to public. The LB technique is shown and described in detail in G.L. Grains, Jr. Insoluble Molecular at Liquid Gas Interface , Interscience, New York, 1966 . The CA technique is shown and described in A.T. DiBenedetto, D.A. Scola. J. Colloid Interface Sci., 64, 480 1978 H. Ishida, S. Naviroj, J.L. Koenig, Physico Chemical Aspects of Polymer Surface Vol. 1, p.91, Ed. K.L. Mittal, Plenum, N.Y. 1983 H. Ishida, J.L. Koenig, J. Polymer Sci., 17, 1807 1979 L. Netzer, J. Sagiv, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 105, 674 1983 . The LB and CA techniques are methods for producing monomolecular films or monomolecular built up films. By use of these techniques, molecular controlled structure, which has regularity to some degree in a direction perpendicular to the surface of built up or stacked film, can be obtained by changing kinds of molecules, but it is almost impossible to have the molecular controlled structure include regularity in a direction of the surface of the film by changing kinds of molecules on the film surface. In summary, the conventional LB and CA techniques are methods capable of producing a molecular controlled structure which is controlled only in a two dimensional direction, but it is impossible to produce a molecular controlled structure which is controlled in a three dimensional direction. Accordingly, a principal object of the invention is to provide a molecular controlled structure which has three dimensional structure and is used for molecular devices, molecular memorys etc of bio computer and method of producing the molecular controlled structure. This and other objects will be accomplished by a molecular controlled structure which comprises a plurality of normal chain hydrocarbon molecules, each having at one end thereof energy responsive group and having at the other end thereof reaction group which reacts the responsive group or induced group from the responsive group. At least some of the molecules have functional group which responds to light, electron beam, X ray, r ray, heat, electron, or ion. The molecules are connected in three dimensional configuration. In a specific embodiment, the energy responsive group includes double bonding of C C or carbons, and the reaction group includes Si. The functional group includes conjugated double bonding or group which forms conjugated double bonding in the course of production of the molecular controlled structure. This invention also relates to a method of producing a molecular controlled structure which comprises steps of forming a thin film which includes responsive group producing chemical raction due to irradiation of energy beam on a substrate, selectively activating the responsive group by irradiating energy beams with the thin film in a pattern in gaseous atmosphere or in liquid, and selectively bonding chemical substance on said activated portion. In a specific embodiment, as the chemical substance, a molecule having reaction group to be reacted with the responsive group activated at one end and having another responsive group which functions in the same manner as the responsive group at the other end is used. A molecular thin film is formed by Langmuir Brodgett technique or absorptiion technique in such manner that responsive groups are exposed and juxtaposed on the surface of substrate in the step of forming the thin film. The chemical substance or reagent includes Si and vinyl group. The chemical substance or reagent includes NH₂ group, SH group, C CH group. This invention has various advantages, among which are as follows. By use of this invention, it becomes possible to form a functional molecule which is needed at a desired position on a substrate. This is advantageous in production of molecular devices etc. Further, molecular wiring technique according to this invention may be utilized in production of bio computer etc. While the novel features of the invention are set forth with particularly in the appended claims, the invention, both as to organization and content, will be better understood and appreciated, along with other objects and features thereof, from the following detailed description in conjuction with the drawings. In the following, embodiments of this invention are described with reference to Figs. 1 3. A first embodiment of this invention is described with reference to Fig. 1. On a Si substrate 10 formed with SiO₂, there is formed by chemical adsorption process, a monomolecular film 12 of through hydrolysis and dessication, and the reaction with surface of silane surface active agent, e.g., CH₂ CH CH₂ at the SiO₂ surface FIG. 1 a . Now, the vinyl groups 16 of the silane surface active agent are juxtaposed on the surface of substrate 10. Then, electron beams 18, which is converged to about 5 nm 50Å in diameter, is used as energy beams and are irradiated onto the surface in a pattern under H₂O atmosphere of about 10 ³ 10 ⁴ of H₂O so that active groups, i.e., OH groups 20 are added to a part of the vinyl groups 16 in accordance with the irradiation pattern FIG. 1 b . Thereafter, silane surface active agent CH₂ CH CH₂ is formed FIG. 1 c . That is, by the above stated process, a molecule film 26 of is selectively formed at an area which is desired. Further, on the surface of molecules added, vinyl groups 28 are juxtaposed and form a film. By the repetition of the pattern irradiation of the energy beams, and the adding reaction of silane surface active agent, a molecular controlled structure is produced in such manner that molecules are juxtaposed regularly in a three dimensional direction. In the above stated embodiment, normal chain type hydrocarbon which has CH₂ CH groups at one end of molecules and has SiCℓ₃ groups at the other end of molecules silane surface active agent is used. If functional groups, for example, diacetylene, pyrrole, chenylene, phenylene etc. are inserted between CH₂ CH₂ bondings of normal chain type hydrocarbon or added instead of H, conjugated double bondings which shows electric conductivity at the level of molecule can be formed and it is possible to control the forming of wiring of organic molecules which is necessary for production of molecular devices at the level of molecule. For example, as shown in FIG. 2 a , diacetylene group 30 is inserted between CH₂ CH₂ . After a molecular controlled structure is formed, deep UV is irradiated therewith so that molecular wiring of poly diacetylene 32 FIG. 2 b can be formed in a direction which is desired in the same plane. In case that electric conductivity is needed in a vertical direction, molecules, in each of which insertion position of poly diacetylene into normal chain hydrocarbon portion is shifted every 3 carbon atoms. Further, as shown in FIGS. 2 c e , molecules 34 including phenyl group 36 instead of the above stated diacetylene group can be added by the irradiation of electron beams 18 at the side position of poly diacetylene forming layer 40, thereby molecules having phenyl group are regularly formed as a layer 42, in adjacent to the layer 40 of molecules having diacetylene group. When CH CH group is used instead of CH₂ CH group and NH₂ group is used instead of SiCℓ₃ group, the same advantages as stated above may be obtained. In another method, cyanobromide CNBr is added to OH group 6 as shown in the following formula 3 to thereby be cyanized. Thereafter, amino group is reacted thereto so that monomolecule can be selectively added. cyanobromide technique . As still another method, there is a method in which amino group is added by use of end epoxy group as shown in the following formula 4 epoxy technique . As one example, there is a case that CH CH CH₂ Thereafter, it is selectively reacted with NH₂ group which is then added thereto as shown in the following formula 2 . aldehyde technique Further, adding reaction by use of reaction between end thiol group R SH and may be used see, formula 5 . In the forgoing embodiments, if diameter of electron beam is made smaller e.g., about 0.5 nm 5Å , it becomes necessarily possible to produce a molecular controlled structure by controlling each molecule one by one. It is also possible to form molecules with regularity at a desired portion by controlling plural kinds of molecules. For example, it is possible to produce a molecular controlled structure shown in FIG. 3. In FIG. 3, A, B, C represent different functional groups, respectively. The molecules having 3 kinds of functional groups are formed regularly in 3 i.e., vertical, horizontal, hight directions. While specific embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, it is realized that modifications and changes will occurr to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all modifications and changes as fall within the scope of the invention.
