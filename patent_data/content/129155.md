# APPARATUS FOR CALIBRATING GRANITE, MARBLE, AND THE LIKE IN SLAB FORM

## Abstract
The apparatus for calibrating granite, marble, and the like in slab form, comprises a base frame on which a carpet con veyor 2 for transporting slabs 40 to be calibrated is caused to run and carries a calibrating head 10 which is movable perpendicularly to the plane of lay of the slabs 40 . The calib rating head 10 includes a calibrating roller 20 driven rota tively about its own axis and having its axis substantially parallel to the plane of lay of said slabs 40 and substantially perpendicular to the direction of advance of the slabs 40 . Furthermore an abrasive form 30 , provided on the lateral surface of said roller 20 , extends unbroken around the roller 20 into a substantially helical pattern.
