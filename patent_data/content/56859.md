# Diffuser arrangements.

## Abstract
A diffusion washer and or thickener assembly is pro vided that is greatly simplified. A number of withdrawal screens 12 and fluid introducing structures 14 are pro vided supported by spider arms 24 which comprise con duits 16 for introduction of liquid into and withdrawal of liquid from an elongated upright hollow vessel 10 in which the assembly is disposed. The conduits 16 , with attached screens 12 , are reciprocated up and down by a single linear actuator 60 located above the vessel 10 and within the cross sectional area thereof so that the side 11 and bottom 13 walls of the vessel need not be penetrated by the conduits 16 . The screens 12 and fluid introducing struc tures 14 remain stationary with respect to each other during reciprocation. A number of wiper blades 64 , which may be operated by a single linear actuator 66 , are provided at the top of the vessel 10 for moving upwardly flowing pulp into withdrawal conduits 62 surrounding the vessel periphery.
