# Process for producing a polyisocyanurate foam and a polyisocyanurate foam laminate and foam and laminate obtained by this process.

## Abstract
A process for producing a polyisocyanurate foam 53 and a laminate of polyisocyanurate foam 57, 57 which is the reaction product of a polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate and a polyol which is ethoxylated trimethylol propane, ethoxylated trimethylol ethane, ethoxylated pentaerythritol or ethoxylated glycerin. Laminates of such foams exhibit improved adhesion of the facing sheet 51 .
