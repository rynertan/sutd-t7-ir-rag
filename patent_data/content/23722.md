## Description
This invention relates to lithographic printing plates and to a process for making such plates.Lithographic printing techniques, using, for example, anodized and silicated aluminum base plates such as described in Fromson patent No. 3,181,461 issued May 4, 1965, have come into widespread use in the printing industry and especially in offset printing and direct lithographic printing by newspapers using converted letterpress printing presses.A conventional negative working lithographic printing plate of this type has a coating of a light sensitive substance that is adherent to the aluminum base sheet for exposure. If the light sensitive coating is applied to the base sheet by the manufacturer, the sheet is referred to as a presensitized plate . If the light sensitive substance is applied to the base by the lithographer or trade plate maker, the plate is referred to as a wipe on plate . Depending on the nature of photosensitive coating employed, a coated plate may be utilized to reproduce directly the image to which it is exposed, in which case it is termed a positiveacting plate, or to produce an image complementary to the one to which it is exposed, in which case it is termed a negative acting plate.In either case, the image area of the developed plate is oleophilic and the non image area is hydrophilic. In the case of negative working plate, the surface is coated with an aqueous solution of a conventional diazo resin. The plate is dried and exposed through a negative. The exposed image areas become water insoluble and the unexposed non image areas remain water soluble. The plate is conventionally developed with a lithographic lacquer which consists of a twophase system, one phase containing an oleophilic resin in a solvent and the other phase a hydrophilic gum.Upon application, the oleophilic resin adheres to the exposed insoluble areas, while the hydrophilic phase dissolves away the unexposed soluble non image areas.In this way, the image areas are made oleophilic or ink receptive and the non image areas are made hydrophilic or ink repellent.The use of organic solvents in lithographic developing compositions create ecological problems and the art has long sought a water developable lithographic plate.In searching for a water developable plate, it has been discovered that the use of certain materials not only make this possible but also produce an improved and highly sensitive lithographic plate. SUMMARYThe lithographic printing plate of the invention has a a substrate having a hydrophilic, anionic, negati vely charged surface and b a layer on the surface of a light sensitive cationic, positively charged diazonium material which I when selectively and incompletely exposed to actinic light becomes adhered to the substrate in the exposed areas and II couples in situ after exposure when treated with an anionic material in an ionizing reaction medium to form a reaction product which is insoluble in the reaction medium in the exposed areas but soluble in the unexposed areas thereby simultaneously reinforcing the diazonium material in the exposed areas and removing coupled diazonium material from the unexposed areas.The process of the invention for making a lithographic printing plate includes the steps of a providing a substrate having a hydrophilic, anionic, negatively charged surface and a layer on the surface of a light sensitive cationic, positively charged diazonium material b selectively and incompletely exposing the substrate to actinic light whereby the light sensitive material becomes adhered to the substrate in the exposed areas c treating the substrate after exposure with an anionic material in a reaction medium to form a reaction product which is insoluble in the reaction medium in the exposed areas but soluble in the unexposed areas whereby the diazonium material in the exposed areas is reinforced and the coupled diazonium material in the unexposed areas is simultaneously removed.The invention can also be described in terms of a lithographic printing plate having an oleophilic, amplified image which is formed by a providing a substrate having a hydrophilic, anionic, negatively charged surface and a layer on said surface of a light sensitive, cationic, positively charged diazonium material having a multiplicity of reactive sites b selectively and incompletely exposing said layer to actinic light for a period of time sufficient to react only a portion of the reactive sites in the exposed area, the resulting light reacted sites being adhered to the substrate, c treating the substrate after exposure with an anionic material in a reaction medium to form a reaction product which is insoluble in the reaction medium in the exposed areas but soluble in the un exposed areas whereby the diazonium material in the exposed areas is reinforced and the coupled diazonium material in the unexposed areas is simultaneously removed. DESCRIPTIONLithographic printing plates of the invention, more specifically lithographic printing plates using light sensitive multi functional diazonium materials, preferably diazonium resins or polymeric diazo materials formed by the condensation reaction with aldehydes, are greatly improved in their photoresponse which comes about trough an ampli ication treatment which develops the plate at the same time.In the past, a great deal of effort has been devoted to the amplification of photochemical reactions initiated by the absorption of actinic radiation. Higher sensitivity can be achieved by increasing quantum yields or by amplification. By quantum yields it is meant that for every photon of incident radiation of specified wavelength that is absorbed by a photochemical material, there is a photochemical reaction which is signaled by either the disappearance or creation of a product. The ratio of this primary process is the quantum yield. For substances such as diazonium salts this ratio is usually one or less than one. To increase the quantum yield such things as deactivators, florescence compounds, etc., must be avoided. More fruitful means of doing the same, however, can be achieved by amplification.Amplification to achieve photographic speed can be done by development in classical silver halide chemistry.The amplification factor is 106. In electrophotography using charge dissipation and subsequent toning, amplification of 106 can be achieved. In photopolymers, the amplification via polymerization after the initial primary process has been initiated is 105. With respect to diazonium materials, however, there is no known amplification technique. This means that the primary process is all that is realized with diazonium materials.There have been some instances where quantum yields in the area of two have been achieved but generally a quantum yield approaching one is all that is possible. It has been discoverd that polyfunctional diazonium materials, that is materials containing two or more light sensitive diazonium groups in the same molecule, can be effectively amplified according to the invention.While not intending to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the invention functions in the following manner Diazonium salts such as 4 Diazodi phenylamine sulfate, reacted with formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde forms a polymeric condensation product having a functionality greater than two. This polymeric structure is described in a paper byKen ichi Shimazu, Photography Science and Engineering,Vol. 17, No. 1, Jan. Feb. 1973. An idealized structure for this material is as follows EMI6.1 Taking into account the polyfunctionality of this material, upon exposure to actinic radiation, a few diazo groups will absorb photons. Photon adsorption destroys diazo groups in a random fashion. From a statistical point of view, the chances that all the diazonium groups on a particular molecule will be destroyed upon exposure is very remote.Even with very high levels of actinic radiation, the chances that every diazonium group on a given molecule will be destroyed are minimal. Therefore, after exposure particularly to low levels of actinic light it is believed that the diazonium material takes on the following configuration EMI7.1 The amplification step of the invention follows exposure to actinic light. Diazonium molecules are very strong cations and react instantaneously with materials of the the opposite charge, namely, anionic materials such as surfactants, dyes, polymers and the like. Thus, when an incompletely exposed polyfunctional diazonium material is treated with an anionic surfactant such as sodium lauryl sulfate, a coupling reaction between diazonium material and the anionic surfactant takes place.The coupled material produces an oleophilic amplification in the exposed image while at the same time, in the unexposed background area, the coupling reaction results in simultaneous removal of the light sensitive material. It is thus believed that there is a two step sequence, first the coupling reaction between the diazonium material and an anionic material in an ionizing reaction medium, followed by dissolution in the reaction medium of the coupled material from the background. Dissolution does not follow coupling or amplification in the image area because prior exposure to actinic light adheres the light sensitive material to the substrate which prevents dissolution in the reaction medium.Suitable anionic surfactants are water soluble and include the alkali metal salts of alkylaryl sulfonates having 1 to 20 carbon atoms in the alkyl portion and 6 to 14 carbon atoms in the aryl portion, alkali metal salts of alkyls sulfonates having 12 to 20 carbon atoms and ammonium and alkali metal salts of sulfated higher fatty alcohols having 10 to 20 carbon atoms. Anionic materials used in the invention are dissolved in an ionizing reaction medium usually water and the concentration of the anionic material is sufficient to dissolve the coupled reaction product between the diazonium and anionic materials without exceeding the solubility product that would otherwise cause precipitation.Specific examples of anionic surfactants are given hereintogether with a test to determine suitability.The effectiveness of certain anionic surfactants can be improved by adjusting the pH or by using a cosolvent such as an alkyl alcohol containing 1 8 carbon atoms or a glycol.While a pH adjuster or co solvent can be present, the presence of other materials such as cationic that will interfere with or prevent the coupling reaction between the diazonium and anionic materials in both the image exposed and non image areas and dissolution of the coupled material in the non image areas, must be avoided.Cationic dyes can be applied to the anionically charged substrate or incorporated in the light sensitive material to provide a visible image on the plate.Suitable. dyes include basic cationic dyes such asVictoria green Rhodamine B, Rhodamine 5GLD, crystal violet, extra pure APN, Paper Blue R and the like.Cationic light sensitive materials used in the invention are diazonium materials having at least two reactive sites per molecule with each reactive site being capable of being chemically altered by light or chemically reacted with an anionic material. For example, 4 diazo diphenylamine condensed with a carbonyl compound such as formaldehyde has the needed multiplicity of reactive sites each having the required dual functionality. Such a condensed diazo compound coupled with an aromatic compound such as the sulphonic acid of benzophenone to make it water insoluble is only light sensitive and cannot undergo chemical amplification according to the invention.Preferred are water soluble diazonium compounds but water insoluble compounds can also be used. Suitable diazonium compounds are described in U. S. 3,849,392 to Steppan and U. S. 3,311,605 to Steppan.The hydrophilic, anionic lithographic substrate can be a single sheet or a laminate and can be rigid or flexible. The substrate may be a coated paper, a plastic film or sheet or a metallic sheet each treated to render the surface hydrophilic and anionically charged. The preferred lithographic substrate is anodized aluminum which may be pretreated before anodizing to roughen or grain the surface, for example using mechanical, chemical or electrochemical techniques as are well known in the art and it may be posttreated after anodizing. It is preferred to impart hydrophilicity and anionic charge by silicating as described in Fromson patent No. 3,181,461.After treatment with the anionic material, the image can be reinforced with an oleophilic UV curable material which can be coated on and then cured. This is described in copending application Serial No. 972,567, filed December 22, 1978, which is incorporated herein by way of reference.Suitable W curable materials are commercially available from a number of sources in the form of W curable inks, coatings, oligomers and monomers. Such commercially available materials can be obtained from the following companies Inmont Corporation, Sinclair Valentine, CelaneseChemical Company, 3 M Company, Desoto Chemical Company,Paulimer Industries, Shell Chemical, Mobile Chemical,W. R. Grace, Design Coat Company, and Ware ChemicalCorporation. UV curable materials including monomers and oligomers are described in the following patents U. S. 3,297,745 1967 U. S. 3,380,381 1968 U. S. 3,673,140 1972 U. S. 3,770,643 1972 U. S. 3,712,871 1973 U. S. 3,804,736 1974There are also materials that will cure upon exposure to other sources of radiation, for example an electron beam. These curable materials can be used in special applications in place of the UV material and are commercially available. Electron beam curable compositions are described in U. S. patents 3,586,526 30, 1971.Chemical amplification after exposure to actinic radiation according to the invention makes it possible to substantially reduce exposure times normally required with diazonium compounds. This can be expressed empirically as simply the amount of actinic light necessary to produce an image capable of running on a lithographic press. Chemical amplification according to the invention makes it possible to reduce the amount of light needed to attain this by a factor of from 2 to 10 or more. This means that a diazo sensitized plate that normally required 1 or 2 minutes to image can now be imaged in a matter of seconds. The amount of diazo on the plate can also be reduced.The amount of light necessary to produce an image capable of running on a lithograpic press can also be expressed in terms of millijoules per square centimeter.In carrying out the invention the amount of actinic light can be from less than about 100 to as little as 2 5 millijoules cm at W wave lengths of 300 400 nanometers. This means that plates of the invention can be imaged with low power lasers such as are marketed by EOCOM Inc.The invention thus greatly improves the photo response of lithographic printing plates to a point approaching projection speed while using conventional diazinium materials. Exposure times can be reduced to 1 to 10 seconds under conventional conditions whereas prior techniques using the same conditions required 60 or more seconds. This means that lithographic plates according to the invention can be imaged using lasers, with a projection size negative or with contact size negative. Plates can also be made with continuous tone images using a negative without the customary screen.After treatment with the anionic material the developed amplified image can be blanket exposed to actinic light to photo react any remaining light sensitive sites in the image area. This includes coupled diazonium and. anionic materials which remain light sensitive after coupling.A test to determine whether a particular anionic material is suitable is as follows A 5 aqueous solution of the anionic material is prepared. An aluminum lithographic plate grained, anodized, and silicated is coated with a 1 solution of a light sensitive diazo condensation product such as Fairmont s Chemical Diazo i 4 . The coated plate is exposed to a Stouffer Graphic Arts Guide for a relatively short period of time 5 to 10 seconds. The exposed plate is immersed in the 5 solution of anionic material for 10 seconds. The plate is then rinsed and lacquered with a standard lithographic lacquer such as Fairmont s Black Lacquer . Another plate, identically prepared and exposed, is treated with the Black lacquer only. This is the control. The two plates are compared.If the anionic material is effective, the post treated plate will show significant difference in light sensitivity versus the control.The effectiveness of certain anionic materials can be enhanced by either a pH adjustment and or the use of a co solvent. The optimum pH for most anionic materials useful in this invention is in the range of pH 2 10. Suitable co solvents are alcohols such as ethanol, butanol and the like and glycols. Many different salts of anionic materials are suitable these include sodium, lithium, ammonium, or triethanol amine salts and the like.

Results if anything a slight improvement over Example 16, 30 seconds step 1 2 and 60 seconds solid step 4.EXAMPLE 17This example is to show the utility of solvent soluble polymerized polyazo molecules. A 1 solution of subtractive diazo BBP MRI Inc. , polymethylene paradiazo diphenylamine zinc fluoride phosphate is made up in 80 20 methylcellusolve DMF. A plate is coated and exposed similar to Example 2. The exposed plate is immersed in a 50 50 solution of 5 sodium lauryl butylolactone GAF . The plate is rinsed and lacquered with a Fairmont Black Lacquer.Result 1 second ghost image, 5 seconds step 2, 10 seconds step 4, 15 seconds step 5, 30 seconds step 7, and 60 seconds step 9.EXAMPLE 18A plate was processed as in previous example except that the developer was 100 butyrolactone the plate rinsed and lacquered.Result 1 second no image, 5 seconds no image, 10 seconds no image, 15 seconds ghost image, 30 seconds step 1, and 60 seconds step 2. This verifies the utility of sodium lauryl sulfate even in solvent systems.EXAMPLE 19This experiment illustrates the utility of anionic developers containing no organic solvents to develop photosensitive polyazo compounds which are solvent soluble. This type of solvent soluble diazo material is described in detail in U. S. Patent 3,790,556. A similar solvent soluble diazo product was prepared in the following luannero To 1,500 milliliters of a S solution of sodium lauryl sulfate is added the following with stirring 300 nl. of a 10 e solution of diazo resin FairmontChemical . A voluminous precipitate is then dissolved in 2 methyoxyethanol to make up a 1 coating solution Shcdzzine is also added at the 1 2 level. An aluminum lithographic plate grained, anodized, and silicated is coated using a two roll coater and exposed similarly to Example 2. The exposed plate is then processed in a 5 8 water solution of sodium lauryl sulfate. After processing, the results are a strong visible image. The plate is then inked producing a clean lithographic product.
