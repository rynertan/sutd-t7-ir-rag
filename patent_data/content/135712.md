## Description
ANTIGENS AND MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES REACTIVE AGAINST SPOROZOITES OF THE Eimeria spp. The invention herein described relates to monoclonal antibodies which react specifically against sporozoites of the parasite Eimeria tenella. Hybridoma cultures producing antibodies against E. tenella are described. Such antibodies are obtained by means of hybridoma technology. Sporozoite antigens are identified and characterized. These antigens, along with certain monoclonal antibodies are effective for the prevention and treatment of coccidiosis. The antigens of the invention are useful as vaccines against coccidiosis. By way of background, coccidiosis is a disease of animals caused by a variety of protozoan parasites.Avian coccidiosis is a devastating disease of poultry caused by a variety of species of the genus Eimeria.This disease has a complicated life cycle consisting of both asexual and sexual stages. Chickens are initially infected with the disease after ingestion of free living oocysts which are generally associated with fecal material. Oocysts develop into invasive asexual sporozoites in the chicken s digestive tract. The sporozoites infect epithelial cells and develop into multinucleate structures known as schizonts. Each schizont matures and eventually liberates multiple invasive asexual structures known as merozoites. These merozoites leave the infected cell and reinvade other epithelial cells. The multiple invasive asexual stages involving sporozoites and merozoites account for much of the pathology of coccidiosis. The sexual cycle of coccidiosis is initiated when merozoites differentiate into gametocytes.Fertilization occurs and the fertilization products known as oocysts are released in the feces. s Thus the parasite s life cycle is completed.In chickens, the life cycle of Eimeria tenella, a representative species, is completed in about 7 to 9 days. Due to the tremendous economic losses inflicted on the poultry industry by Eimeria species, a vaccine against the parasite is highly desirable. However, due to the complexity of the life cycle of the parasite and the variability of the quantity of antigens present in each stage, it has been observed that deactivated or killed parasites have not generated consistent immunity in the past. One solution to this problem is to isolate and characterize particular antigens from the parasite and administer them in a sufficient amount to serve as an immunizing agent. Preferably such antigens will offer protection against infection by all important species.It is known that various species of Eimeria, as well as different stages in the life cycle of the same species, have both common and specific antigens Cerna, Z., FoliaParasitologica Prague 17 135 140 1970 Davis et al.,Immunol. 34 879 888 1978 Rose, M.E., Immunol.2 112 122 1959 Rose et al., Immunol. 5 79 92 1962 and Tanielian et al., Acta Parasitol. Yugosl. 7 79 84 1976 . It is also known that development of immunity to Eimeria is species specific and in some species of domestic fowl there is significant strain specific immunity Jeffers, T.K. In Long, P.L. et al. eds. ,Avian Coccidiosis, pp. 57 125, Proc. 13th Poultry Sci.Symp. 1978 Joyner, L.P., Parasitol. 59 725 732 1969 Long, P.L., Parasitol. 69 337 347 1974 and Long et al., Parasitol. 79 451 457 1979 . Currently immunogens of Eimeria species capable of stimulating protective immunity in avian or mammalian hosts have not yet been isolated or identified. Such Eimeria immunogens will likely provide successful immunization against coccidiosis. The development of lymphocyte hybridoma technology provides a tool for producing relatively large amounts of specific antibodies against various antigens of Eimeria. By fusing specific antibody producing cells spleen cells with cells of a myeloma tumor, it is possible to produce hybridoma cells that secrete monoclonal antibodies directed specifically against the original sensitizing antigen. Köhler Milstein,Nature London 256 495 497 1975 . If monoclonal antibodies against the parasite are obtained, it may be possible to provide such anitbodies to infected or susceptible fowl and to thus provide the host organism with a measure of passive immunity.Once such hybridoma cultures producing monoclonal antibodies are obtained, it is possible by various procedures to utilize such antibodies to isolate and identify specific antigens which could in turn be utilized as a vaccine to provide host organisms with a system of active immunity. Various patents concerning hybridoma cultures and monoclonal antibodies are known i.e., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,172,124 4,196,265 4,271,145 4,361,549 4,631,550 4,364,932 4,364,933 4,364,934 4,364,935 4,364,936 4,381,292 and 4,381,295 . In light of the foregoing discussion of the economic effects of coccidiosis in the area of animal husbandry and more specifically in the poultry industry control of the protozoan parasite Eimeria is highly desirable. Accordingly, an object of this invention is to provide new and useful monoclonal antibodies obtained against sporozoites of the genus Eimeria. A further object is to isolate and identify specific antigens of E.tenella useful as a vaccine for the control of avian coccidiosis. These objects are manifest in the following description and particularly delineated in the appended claims. A preparation of E. tenella sporozoites is used to immunize mice in order to eventually generate monoclonal antibodies following the method of Köhlerand Milstein as described below. The monoclonal antibodies are used to identify antigens of the parasite. The antigens which elicit monoclonal antibodies that react with sporozoites, and show neutralization of parasite growth, are considered protective antigens. The protective antigens that occur in various species of Eimeria are regarded as potential candidates for the development of a vaccine against avian coccidiosis. Soluble antigens are obtained from sporozoites of E tenella. These soluble antigens are separated electrophoretically by molecular weight and those which specifically react with monoclonal antibodies of the present invention are identified. Using appropriate standards, the reactive antigens are then characterized on the basis of molecular weight. In order to evaluate the ability of the monoclonal antibodies to effectively neutralize the infective capability of coccidial sporozoites, chickens are exposed to sporozoites of E. tenella previously treated with various monoclonal antibodies of the invention. This in vivo experimental system demonstrates the protective capabilities of selected monoclonal antibodies. Chickens receiving injections of solubilized sporozoite antigens including those identified by the corresponding monoclonal antibodies were found to be protected against oral challenge. This immunizatibn procedure demonstrates the vaccine potential of sporozoite antigens which can be recognized by monoclonal antibodies. The following non limiting Examples further serve to illustrate the invention EXAMPLE 1 Construction of Hybridoma Lines Sporozoites of the organism Eimeria tenella are obtained by excysting sporulated oocysts using established procedures Doran et al., Proc. Helmintol. Soc. Wash.34 59 65 1967 1. A preparation of E. tenella sporozoites thus obtained is used to immunize eighteen week old femaleBALB c mice by intraperitoneal injection. After determining that an immunized mouse is producing anti sporozoite antibodies using an indirect immunofluorescence assay IFA technique known to the art, spleen cells are obtained from the mouse and fused with mouse myeloma cell line P3X63. Ag8.653. The fusion process is carried out in the presence of 30 to 35 polyethylene glycol 950 1050 . The method of generating hybridomas has been previously described c.f.,Kennett et al., Monoclonal Antibodies Plenum Press 365 371, 1980 . Hybridoma fusion products are cultured inHAT medium Littlefield, J.W., Science, 145 709 710 1964 containing Iscove s modified Dulbecco s medium IMDM with 20 fetal calf serum supplement. Culture media are monitored for anti sporozoite antibody production by indirect immunofluorescence assay IFA using glutaraldehyde fixed sporozoites of E. tenella as the antigen source. Of all the cultures tested, 33 wells were found positive by IFA. In order to ensure monoclonicity of the hybridoma cultures, a limiting dilution procedure was employed. Following exposure of E. tenella sporozoites to various monoclonal antibodies of the invention, three major IFA reactivity patterns on treated sporozoites are observed 1 reaction on the entire surface of sporozoites 2 surface reaction as patches on the sporozoites 3 internal reaction around the nuclear membranes of sporozoites. These reaction patterns are confirmed by ferritin labelling and transmission election microscopy Speer et 1., J. of Protozoology in press . As assessed by IFA, hybridoma cultures of the invention generate identical antibodies after cloning.Clones are grown either in vitro or in BALB c mice as peritoneal tumors and the ascites fluid contains antibodies in a concentration of up to approximately 10 mg ml. EXAMPLE 2 Preparation of Antigens Associated with E. tenella sporozoites Freshly excysted sporozoites of E. tenella are used for the antigen preparation. The outer membrane components of the sporozoites are extracted using detergents i.e., 0.5 Nonidet P40, 0.5 to 2 CHAPS, or 0.5 to 1 Triton X 100 in 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer having a pH of 7.8. The buffer contains the following protease inhibitors aprotinin 2 trypsin units ml antipain 25 vg ml leupeptin 25 ug ml , phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride 4 mM Yoshida et al., J. Exp. Med., 154 1225 i236 1981 j. The detergent solubilized material is centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 10 minutes to remove particulate matter.The clear supernatant contains soluble antigens associated with E. tenella sporozoites. EXAMPLE 3 Antigen Characterization Soluble antigens of E. tenella sporozoites are separated by molecular weight using SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE Laemmli, U.K., Nature 227 680 685 1970 . The SDS PAGE separated proteins are transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes using the Western blotting technique Towbin et al., Proc., Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76 4350 4354 1979 .The nitrocellulose filter is then reacted with either diluted ascites fluid or spent hybridoma culture fluid containing antibodies. Bound monoclonal antibodies are then detected by using a radioimmuno detection method involving 125I labelled anti mouse IgG antibody NewEngland Nuclear . The unbound second antibody is removed by washing, and the nitrocellulose filters are then exposed with Kodak X ray film XAR 5. Alternatively, specific antigen monoclonal antibody complexes are identified by an ELISA technique using horseradish peroxidase coupled rabbit IgG antibody Cappel Lab against mouse immunoglobulin Burnette et al., Anal. Biochem. 112 195 203 1981 . The Bio RadImmuno Blot Assay Kit is employed. The apparent molecular weights of the reactive sporozoite antigens are determined by comparing the electrophoretic Rf values of the antigens with Rf values of known molecular weight compounds run as standards along with the antigens in the same system. The experimental molecular weight data of various antigens are presented in Table I. TABLE I MOLECULAR WEIGHT DETERMINATION OF VARIOUS E.

The caeca of the fowl are the sites of infection by B. tenella and are accessable by surgery Burns et al., Exp. Parasitol 8 515 526 1959 Lawn et al., J.Parasitol. 68 1117 1123 1982 1. The caeca of chickens are surgically exposed and infused with preparations of tenella sporozoites which have been previously treated with monoclonal antibodies of the invention Freshly excysted sporozoites are incubated under sterile conditions with heat inactivated ascites fluid ontaining monoclonal antibodies derived from hybridoma lines of the invention. The incubation period is for 30 to 60 minutes at 250 to 370C. An incubation period of 370C for 60 minutes is preferred. Treated sporozoites are then introduced into he caeca of threeweek old chickens by surgical procedures. At the end of a five day incubation period1 the caeca of the infected chickens are observed for lesions. The five day incubation period represents the most destructive stage of coccidiosis. Results of this experiment are presented inTable II. It is noted that monoclonal antibodies s3 and s8 both provided 60 total protection against infection by sporozoites of E. tenella.

Two boosters followed at ten day intervals each employing one half the initial immunizing dose of material in Freund s incomplete adjuvant. Ten days after the last booster, the chickens were challenged with 50,000 oocysts orally. Five days post challenge, caecal lesions were observed. Results on this experiment are presented in Table III. It is noted that soluble antigens render significant protection against oral oocyst challenge whereas normal chickens are not protected.
