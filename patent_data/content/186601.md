# DUAL FUELED THERMOELECTRIC GENERATOR

## Abstract
A dual fueled thermoelectric generator wherein two different sources of energy are provided. The first source 23 of energy is electrical energy which is tapped from an overhead transmission ground wire 72 and converted into thermal energy by electric resistance heaters 21 . The thermal energy produced is applied to a thermopile 22 which converts it into DC electric energy. The second source 14 is a fossil fuel which is converted into thermal energy when a burner 30 is actuated. The thermal energy produced thereby is applied to thermopile 22 . The burner 30 is actuated in response to either a loss of input voltage from the transmission ground wire 72 or loss of output power from the thermopile 22
