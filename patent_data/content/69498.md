# Image transfer method and apparatus.

## Abstract
In a method and apparatus for image transfer from a donor F to a receiver P , back side wetting of the receiver P is prevented by a passing the excess liquid, which collects at the entry nip of lamination rollers 31, 33 through a gap 63 between the rollers after exit of each donor receiver pair from the rollers, and b removing the liquid passed through the gap from the roller 31 that contacts the back sides of the receivers to dry that roller before contacting the back side of the next receiver. The liquid is passed through the gap by a hydrophilic upper roller 31 . The bottom roller 33 is hydrophobic and the liquid is removed from the upper roller 31 by a squeegee member 65 .
