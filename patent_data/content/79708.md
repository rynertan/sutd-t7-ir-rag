# Infrared transmitting material consisting of silver chloride and silver bromide.

## Abstract
Infrared fibers excellent in elongation as well as tensile strength and yield strength, which comprise a mixed crystal containing 0.01 to 10 by weight of silver chloride in silver bromide or a mixed crystal containing 0.01 to 10 by weight of silver bromide in silver chloride. The invention includes an infrared fiber comprising a fiber of the invention enclosed in a protective layer 3 and also an infrared fiber comprising a core 1 consisting of a mixed crystal containing up to 10 by weight of silver chloride in silver bromide and a cladding 2 consisting of a mixed crystal containing up to 10 by weight of silver bromide in silver chloride.
