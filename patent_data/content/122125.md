## Description
Silver halide emulsionBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a silver halide emulsion, more particularly to a silver halide emulsion having a high sensitivity and an improved fogging property.With respect to a light sensitive silver halide photographic material, particularly a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material, there has recently been a strong desire for high sensitivity capable of copying with wide range of conditions for photography in a dark place, accurate photographing of even a rapidly moving object and so on. Thus, there have been developed the sulfur sensitization technique, the selenium sensitization technique and so on which are useful as chemical ripening methods for enhancement of the sensitivity of a silver halide emulsion which has hitherto been used for the above mentioned light sensitive material. Of the above mentioned sensitization techniques, the selenium sensitization technique has been paid attention to as one which is suitable for higher sensitization.As the selenium sensitization technique mentioned above, there are described in the each specification or Publicaition, for example, U.S. Patents No. 1,574,944,No. 1,602,592, No. 1,623,499, No. 2,642,361, No.2,739,060, No. 3,297,446, No. 3,420,67O, No. 3,32O,069, No. 3,658,540, No. 3,408,196, No. 3,408,197, No.3,442,653 and No. 3,591,385 U.K. Patents No. 255,846 andNo. 861,984, West German Patents No. 1,033,510 and No. 1,547,762, French Patents No. 2,093,038 and No.2,093,209 and Japanese Patent Publications No. 34491 1977, No. 34492 1977, No. 295 1978, No. 36009 1977, No.38408 1977 and No. 22090 1982. The conventional selenium sensitization is useful for sensitization of a photographic material, Particularly for improving the sensitivity in the toe portion of the characteristiv curve. However, this method has disadvantages in that it is accompanied by occurrence of fog, and by increase of fog during the storage of a photographic material.A method for removing the above mentioned problems in the selenium sensitization is described in, for example,Japanese Patent Publication No. 20970 1974, in which there has been disclosed a selenium sensitization method of a monodispersed silver halide emulsion. However, this method can not achieve sufficiently high sensitivity and will cause a problem of environmental pollution due to the toxicity of a mercury compound which is added for the purpose of preventing fog.It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a silver halide emulsion of which the sensitivity has sufficiently been enhanced by selenium sensitization and which which has been improved in photographic fogging property and stability during storage, and does not cause any problem such as environmental pollution.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present inventors have found that the above object can be accomplished by a silver halide emulsion having monodispersed silver halide grains which have been selenium sensitized and sulfur sensitized simultaneously or separately in the presence of a nitrogen containing heterocyclic compound capable of forming a complex with silver.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTSThe present invention will be described in further detail below.In the present invention, the above mentioned silver halide grains which are selenium sensitized and sulfur sensitized simultaneously or separately in the presence of a nitrogen containing heterocyclic compound are monodispersed silver halide grains.The monodispersed silver halide grains in this invention refer to those which exhibit a variation coefficient of a grain size distribution of 0.18 or less when the emul sion is observed with an electron microscope photograph.Namely, when the standard deviation S of the grain size distribution is divided by the average grain size r, its value variation coefficient is 0.18 or less. The standard deviation S is calculated by the following formula EMI3.1 The average grain size herein mentioned refers to an average value of diameters in the case of spherical silver halide grains or an average value of diameters of circular images calculated to be of the same area from the projected images in the case of cubic or other shapes than spheres, and r may be defined by the following formula, when individual grain sizes having such a meaning are represented by r. and their numbers by ni EMI4.1 The above grain sizes can be measured according to various methods generally employed in the related field of art for the above purpose.Representative methods are written in Rubland, Grain Size Analytical Method , A.S.T.M. Symposium on light microscopy, 1955, pp. 94 122 or Theory of Photographic Process by Mieth James, 3rd.edition, Chap. 2, published by Macmillan Co. 1966 .This grain size can be measured by the use of the projected area of grains or approximate diameter values.When the grains are substantially of uniform shapes, the grain size distribution can be expressed considerably accurately as diameter or projected area.The relation of the grain size distribution can be determined according to the method described in the essay by Triberi and Smith in Empirical relation between the sensitometry distribution and grain size distribution in photographic emulsions , The Photographic Journal vol.LXXIX 1949 , pp. 330 338.The silver halide grains according to this invention mean the grains having the variation coefficient of 0.18 or less as mentioned above, preferable monodispersed silver halide grains in the present invention are 0.15 or less.As the composition of the silver halide grains, there may be employed widely used materials such as silver chloride, silver bromide, silver chlorobromide, silver iodobromide, silver chloroiodobromide and the like, and preferably silver iodobromide which is suitable for high sensitization. As the shape of the silver halide grains, normal crystals such as hexahedron, octahedron and tetradecahedron are preferable, and normal crystals of octahedron crystal and tetradecahedron crystal are most preferable.The silver halide emulsion having monodispersed silver halide grains according to this invention can be prepared by the use of methods described in P. Glafkides, Chemie et Physique Photographique , published by Paul MontelCo., Ltd. 1967 , G.F. Duffin, Photographic EmulsionChemistry , published by The Focal Press 1966 and V.L. Zelikman et al., Making and Coating PhotographicEmulsion , published by The Focal Press 1964 . That is to say, the silver halide emulsion may be prepared by any of an acidic method, a neutral method and an ammoniacal method, and as a manner of allowing a soluble silver salt to react with a soluble halogen salt, an injection mixing process, a simultaneous mixing process or a combination thereof may be employed. The emulsion having monodispersed silver halide grains according to this invention obtained by the abovementioned preparing method is, in accordance with this invention as mentioned above, selenium sensitized and sulfur sensitized in the presence of the nitrogencontaining heterocyclic compound which is capable of forming a complex with silver.In the nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds used in the present invention, examples of heterocyclic rings include a pyrazole ring, pyrimidine ring, 1,2,4 triazole ring, 1,2,3 triazole ring, 1,3,4 thiadiazole ring, 1,2,3thiadiazole ring, 1,2,4 thiadiazole ring, 1,2,5 thiadiazole ring, 1,2,3,4 tetrazole ring, pyridazine ring, 1,2,3 triazine ring, 1,2,4 triazine ring, 1,3,5 triazine ring, benzotriazole ring, benzimidazole ring, benzothiazole ring, quinoline ring, benzoxazole ring, benzoselena zole ring, naphthothiazole ring, naphthoimidazole ring, rhodanine ring, thiohydantoin ring, oxazole ring, thiazole ring, oxadiazole ring, selenadiazole ring, naphthoxazole ring, oxazolidinedione ring, triazolotriazole ring, azaindene ring such as diazaindene ring, triazaindene ring, tetrazaindene ring, and pentazaindene ring, phthalazine ring and indazole ring.Preferred compounds among the above are the compounds having the azaindene ring, and more preferably, the azaindene compounds having hydroxy groups as substituent groups such as hydroxytriazaindene, hydroxytetrazaindene and hydroxypentazaindene compounds.The heterocyclic rings may have substituent groups other than the hydroxy group.

This amount can be adjusted by the control of an adsorption equilibrium condition in accordance with a variation of a pH and or temperature at the time of ripening.The addition of said compound into the emulsion can be carried out in the form of a solution where it is dissolved in a suitable solvent e.g., water or an aqueous alkaline solution which has no harmful influence on the photographic emulsion. Said compound may be present at a time of the selenium sensitization and sulfur sensitization, but it is preferred that the compound is added thereto at the time of on or before the addition of a selenium sensitizer and sulfur sensitizer. Namely, the compound may be added during the chemical ripening by the selenium sensitizer and sulfur sensitizer, but the addition before the chemical ripening is most preferable.Next, the monodispersed silver halide grains according to this invention are selenium sensitized and sulfur sensitized in the presence of the above mentioned nitrogencontaining heterocyclic compound. Examples of the selenium sensitizer used in the present invention include aliphatic isoselenocyanates such as allyl isoselenocyanate, selenoureas, selenoketones, selenoamides, selenocaboxylic acids, selenocarboxylates, selenophosphates, selenides such as diethylselenide, diethyldiselenide and the like, which are described concretely in U.S. PatentsNo. 1,574,944, No. 1,602,592 and No. 1,623,499. In this invention, while there can widely been employed the selenium sensitizers as described in each of the above publications, a labile type selenium compound may by used more preferably than a non labile type selenium compound such as selenious acid and a selenocyanic acid salt.The term labile has a meaning well known to the art and a labile substance is specifically an appellation for a substance which forms a silver salt when added to an aqueous solution of silver nitrate. For instance, a labile sulfur or selenium compound forms silver sulfate or silver selenide, respectively, when added to an aqueous silver nitrate.The selenium sensitizer usen in this invention also includes wide range of a labile selenium sensitizer, and the descriptions in U.S. Patents. No. 1,623,499, No.1,574,944 and No. 1,602,592 may be referred thereto. Preferable examples of the selenium sensitizers used in this invention include colloidal selenium metals, aliphatic isoselenocyanates and the like, and particularly useful selenium sensitizers include compounds having aliphatic groups as substituent groups such as methylselenourea, ethylselenourea, propylselenourea, isopropylselenourea, butylselenourea, selenoketones e.g. selenoacetone and selenoacetophenone, selenoamides and selenocarboxylic acids as well as compounds which are substituted by aromatic groups or heterocyclic groups such as phenylselenourea, benzothiazolylselenourea, pyridylselenourea and the like. In this invention, in addition to the labile organic selenium compounds as mentioned above, there may also be employed other useful selenium sensitizers having labile selenium atom.Examples of the useful selenium sensitizers include tetramethylseleno urrea, N ss carboxyethyl N ,N dimethylselenourea, selenoacetamide, diethylselenide, 2 selenopropionic acid, 3 selenobutyric acid, methyl 3 selenobutyrate and tri ptolylselenophosphate.Among each kind of selenium sensitizers, particularly preferably employed is selenourea derivatives. An amont of these selenium sensitizers varies under various conditions such as a kind of used selenium sensitizer, a characteristics of the silver halide and ripening conditions, but generally 2.0 x 10 3 to 10 mg, preferably 2.0 x 10 2 to 1.0 mg, more preferably 0.1 to 0.5 mg per mole of the silver halide.The monodispersed silver halide grains according to this invention are carried out the sulfur sensitization together with the above selenium sensitization.In this invention, known types of sulfur sensitizers can be used in the above sulfur sensitization. Examples of the sulfur sensitizer include thiosulfate, allylthio carbamidothiourea, allylisothiocyanate, cystin, p to lu enethiosulfonate and rhodanine. Besides, there can be employed sulfur sensitizers which are disclosed in U.S.Patents No. 1,574,944, No. 2,410,689, No. 2,273,947, No.2,728,668, No. 3,501,313 and No. 3,656,955 West GermanPatent No. 1,422,869 and Japanese Provisional PatentPublications No. 24937 1981 and No. 45016 1980. An amount of the sulfur sensitizer is such that it effectively increases the sensitivity of the emulsion. This amount varies over a fairly extensive range under various conditions such as the amount of the used nitrogencontaining heterocyclic compound, a pH, a temperature and the size of the silver halide grains, but about 0.01 to 100 mg, preferably 0.1 to 10 mg per mole of silver halide is used, as a standard. The above selenium sensitizer and sulfur sensitizer are added as aqueous solutions at a time during the chemical ripening of the emulsion having monodispersed silver halide grains in accordance with the present invention.These sensitizers may be added individually, but simultaneous addition of the both sensitizers is preferable. Thus, silver halide emulsion hereinafter referred to as the emulsion of this invention having monodispersed silver halide grains which are selenium sensitized and sulfur sensitized in the presence of the nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds which are capable of forming a complex with silver.In this invention, effective sensitization can be obtained by further carrying out a gold sensitization.As the gold sensitizers used in this invention, a variety of gold compounds inclusive of ones having oxidation numbers of 1 or 3 can be employed. Typical examples of the gold sensitizers include chloroaurate, potassium chloroaurate, auric trichloride, potassium auric thiocyanate, potassium iodoaurate, tetracyanoauric acid, ammonium aurothiocyanate and pyridyltrichlorogold.An amount of the gold sensitizer is prefrably within the range of about 0.01 to 10 mg, preferably 1.5 x 10 2 to 4 mg per mole of silver halide as a standard, though varying with various conditions.The gold sensitizer may be added to the emulsion of this invention as an aqueous solution. The gold sensitizer is preferably added simultaneously with the addition of the selenium sensitizer and the sulfur sensitizer, but may be added individually.In this invention, the selenium sensitization and sulfur sensitization and the gold sensitization may preferably be carried out in the presence of a solvent for silver halide.The solvents for silver halide used in this invention include a organic thioethers as described in U.S.Patents No. 3,271,157, No. 3,531,289 and No. 3,574,628 and Japanese Provisional Patent Publications No. 1019 1979 and No. 158917 1979 b thiourea derivatives as described in Japanese Provisional Patent Publications No.82408 1978, No. 77737 198Q and No. 2982 1980 c solvents for a silver halide having a thiocarbonyl group sandwiched between an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom and a nitrogen atom as described in Japanese Provisional PatentPublication No. 144319 1978 d imidazoles as described in Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 100717 1979 Ce sulfites f thiocyanates and the like. Specific compounds will be given below EMI12.1 Ho CH2 2 S CH2 2 S CH2 2 EMI13.1 e K2SO3 f NH4scN KSCNAn amount of the solvent for silver halide used for the emulsion of this invention may, in the case of, for example, a thiocyanate, range from 10 to 1000 mg, preferably 50 to 200 mg per mole of silver halide. The solvent for the silver halide may be added to the emulsion so as to present when the selenium sensitization and the sulfur sensitization is carried out, but the addition before the chemical ripening is preferable as the same in the aforesaid nitrogen containing heterocyclic compound according to this invention.In this invention, it is further possible to employ a reduction seneitization together. Usable reducing agents are not particularly limited, but their examples include known stannous chloride, thiourea dioxide, hydrazine derivatives and silane compounds.It is preferred that the reduction sensitization is carried out while the the silver halide grains grow or after the selenium sensitization, sulfur sensitization and gold sensitization have been completed.As described in detail above, the emulsion having the monodispersed silver halide grains of this invention which is selenium sensitized and sulfur sensitized in the presence of the aforesaid nitrogen containing heterocyclic compound, or further gold sensitized and sensitized in the presence of the solvents for silver halide is endowed extremely high sensitivity and reduced the occurrence of photographic fog. In the thus highly sensitized emulsion of this invention, when it constitutes an emulsion layer of a light sensitive material, the monodispersed silver halide grains can be used by mixing together with other silver halide grains. In these emulsion layer, the silver halide grains according to this invention may preferably contain 70 by weight or more based on the total silver halide grains of the layer.The silver halide emulsion of this invention can be carried out a spectral sensitization by adding sensitizing dyes. The addition of the sensitizing dyes can be carried out at the beginning of a chemical ripening which is also called a second ripening of the silver halide emulsion, or during the growth of the ripening, or after the completion of the ripening, or at a suitable time prior to the coating operation of the emulsion.Adding the sensitizing dyes to the aforesaid photographic emulsion can be accomplished by a variety of manners which have heretofore been suggested. For example, a manner described in U.S. Patent No. 3,469,987 may be employed in which the sensitizing dyes are first dissolved in a volatile organic solvent, the resulting solution is dispersed in a hydrophilic colloid, and the thus prepared dispersion is added to the emulsion.With regard to the solvents for the sensitizing dyes, water soluble organic solvents such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol and acetone can be preferably used. An amount of each sensitizing dye is within the range of 1 x 10 5 mole to 2.5 x 10 2 mole, preferably 1.0 x 10 4 mole to 1.0 x 10 3 mole per mole of the silver halide. For the purpose of preventing the occurrence of a photographic fog during a manufacturing process, a storage or a developing treatment, and stabilizing photographic properties, a variety of compounds may be added to the silver halide grains at the time of after the completion of the chemical ripening.Antifoggants and stabilizers which can be used for the aforesaid purposes include many known compounds, for example, azoles such as benzothiazolium salts, nitroindazoles, nitrobenzimidazoles, chlorobenzimidazoles, bromobenzimidazols, mercaptothiazoles, mercaptobenzimidazols, aminotriazoles, benzotriazoles, nitrobenzotriazoles, mercaptotetrazoles particularly l phenyl 5mercaptotetrazole , mercaptopyrimidines, mercaptotriazines, thioketo compounds such as oxazolinethione, and also benzenethiosulfinic acid, benzenesulfinic acid, benzenesulfonamide, hydroquinone derivatives, aminophenol derivatives, gallic acid derivatives and ascorbic acid derivatives.
