# Method and apparatus for producing multi component glass fiber preform.

## Abstract
A method for producing a multi component glass fiber preform which comprises the steps of nebulizing an aqueous solution of at least one metal salt, and reacting the nebulized solution and a gaseous glass raw material with oxygen gas at a high temperature to produce particulate glass material deposited on a substrate. Apparatus for producing such a preform is also disclosed.
