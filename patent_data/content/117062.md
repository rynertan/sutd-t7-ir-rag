# Gas sampling devices.

## Abstract
A temperature actuated flow control device has a fluid inlet connected to an exhaust line with a control chamber 28 located therebetween. The control chamber has a free floating bi metallic circular element 34 which is flexed in response to temperature changes between a first position stopping flow between the inlet and the exhaust line and a second position permitting flow therebetween. This flow control device, when adapted to a gas sampling system, allows the bi metallic element 34 to remain in a first position at normal operating temperature to permit the continuous sampling of the sample gas. Whenever the temperature falls below the dew point of the sample gas, the bi metallic element 34 moves to its second position to stop the sampling of sample gas by the system to prevent condensation in the system.
