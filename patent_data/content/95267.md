## Description
HYDRAULIC MOTOR This invention relates to a hydraulic motor comprising a cylinder assembly, a piston assembly slidable therein, and a position transducer comprising a coil fixed to one of the said assemblies, and a core member fixed to the other assembly so as to extend into the coil an amount dependent upon the position of the piston assembly in the cylinder assemble. There have been many attempts to construct piston and cylinder motors with built in, position sensing elements. Many such systems involve variable resistance or potentiometric type sensor elements, e.g. US 3,726,191. However, such elements include relatively movable and contacting parts, such as wiper elements and resistive elements. As a result, such sensors have been subject to failure due to mechanical wear or due to hydraulically or mechanically induced vibrations. A motor in accordance with the opening paragraph above has been proposed US 3,991,393 , utilizing a single coil with a variable self inductance as a sensing device. However, the performance of the self inductance type sensor is affected by lack of linearity, by temperature variations which vary the resistance of the coil and by magnetic impurities in the hydraulic fluid which vary the permiability of the interior of the coil . It has also been proposed to utilise variable transformers as the sensing devices. However, typical variable transformers, such as linear variable displacement transformers with different windings e.g. US 3,289,479 and US 3,438,306 which can measure displacements in the range of the stroke of an ordinary hydraulic cylinder which has a stroke length of between 25 and 250 mm, are very expensive. Therefore, smaller and less expensive transformers of the same type have been used with motion reducing couplings, such as springs or screw connections, to measure large displacements US 3,160,836 and US 3,403,365 .Such motion reducing couplings are subject to wear, temperature variations and mechanical stress. Such couplings also produce spring or friction created forces which are a drag upon the Accordingly the object of the present invention is to provide an improved motor of the first mentioned kind with an improved means for sensing position which has a linear response and which is insensitive to wear, vibration and temperature variations. The invenveiton is characterised in that the coil has a length exceeding the stroke of the piston assembly and comprises a primary winding and two secondary windings. A blind bore extends centrally into the piston and rod.A primary and two secondary coils are mounted on a hollow cylindrical support tube which is fixed to the cylinder and extends into the blind bore. The two secondary coils are of unequal length, but have a combined length substantially equal to the length of the primary coil. A core or rod is fixed for movement with the piston and rod and is received by the hollow support tube. A circuit generates an output signal representing a ratio of the secondary coil voltages to provide a linear representation of the relative position of the piston within the cylinder. It is preferred that the secondary windings are end to end, one is at least six times as long as the other, the longer secondary winding has a length exceeding the stroke of the piston assembly, and the length of the primary winding substantially equals the combined lengths of the two secondary windings. The invention will now be described in more detail, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig 1 is a partial sectional view of a position sensing fluid motor embodying the present invention. Fig 2 is a sectional view along line 2 2 of Fig 1. Fig 3 is a schematic circuit diagram of a circuit for use with the position sensing fluid motor of Fig 1. A fluid motor 10 includes a cylinder 12 within which reciprocates a pistpn 14 and rod 16. A blind stepped bore 17 extends axially into the piston 14 and rod 16. A housing 18 at the head end of the cylinder 12 receives a screwed in fitting 20 which rigidly supports one end of a hollow cylindrical coil support tube 22 which is constructed of an electrical insulating material, such as glass reinforced epoxy resin. The tube 22 includes a longitudinally extending groove 24 in its outer surface, as best seen in Fig 2. The tube 22 almost completely fills the large portion of the bore 17 when the motor 10 is fully retracted. The tube 22 and bore 17 are long enough so that part of the tube 22 remains within the piston 14 when the motor 10 is fully extended. A magnetic steel core rod 26 is press fitted into the small portion of the blind bore 17 and extends to an end 28 which is contiguous with the plane of the end face 30 of piston 14. A single layer coil of wire is wrapped in a spiral bifilar manner around the outer surface of tube 22 from a position indicated by reference numeral 32 to the end 34 of tube 22. One of the filaments of the bifilar wound coil is continuous, extends the entire length of the coil and forms the primary coil 52 or winding of a 3 coil or winding transformer. The other filament is broken into two coil or winding portions, one of which extends from 32 to a position indicated by reference numeral 36 and is hereinafter referred to as the displacement coil 54. The remaining portion of the other filament extends from 36 to 34 and forms what will be hereinafter referred to as the reference coil 56.The leads to the various coils are routed through and along the groove 24, but are shown removed from Fig 2 for clarity. From the foregoing description and with reference to Fig 1, the following relationships will be apparent. The displacement coil extends from 32 to 36 and is longer than the stroke of the piston 14. The reference coil extends from 36 to 34 and is totally penetrated by at least a portion of the core 26, regardless of the position of the piston 14 and rod 16 with respect to the cylinder 12. Note also that the break between the secondary coils 54 and 56, indicated by reference numeral 36, may be positioned at various places so as to vary the relative lengths of the displacement and reference coils while their overall or combined lengths remain substantially equal to the length of the primary coil which extends from 32 to 34 . Satisfactory operation may be obtained for ratios of displacement to reference coil lengths varying from a ratio of approximately 4.75 to 1 to a ratio of approximately 7 to 1. It should further be noted that the end 32 of the coils is placed a finite distance beyond the end 28 of the core 26. The following dimensions are given by way of example only to illustrate dimensions which have been found to be suitable for a fluid motor as shown in Fig 1 with a 200 mm stroke. The distance between 32 and 28 is 12.5 mm the distance between 32 and 36 is 250 mm and the distance between 36 and 34 is 40 mm. Fig 3 schematically shows a circuit 50 for exciting the primary coil 52 and for deriving a position representative signal from the voltages across the displacement coil 54 and the reference coil 56. Circuit 50 includes a sinusoidal signal generator 58 which applies to the primary coil 52, an AC sinusoidal signal with a peak to peak voltage of approximately 10 volts and a current which varies from 75 to 150 milliamperes, approximately, depending upon the position of the core 26 relative to the coils. A conventional AC to DC converter 60 converts the induced sinusoidal voltages across the displacement coil 54 and the reference coil 56 to DC voltages Vdsp and Vref, respectively.The voltage Vref is applied to the Vr input of an analog to digital converter 62, such as National Semiconductor sADC 0831, which is an A D converter with serial input output, ompatible with 8 bit microprocessors. The voltage Vdsp is applied to the Vin input of the converter 62. A 5 to 10 kilohertz squarewave clock signal is applied to the clock inputC of the converter 62. The converter 62 . berates at its I O output terminal a serial digital output signal, Vo, which is proportional to the ratio of the voltage Vdsp to the voltageVref. This ratiometric digital output signal Vo has a desirable linear dependence upon the position of the piston 14 within the cylinder 12 and thus provides an accurate indication of the positional status of the fluid motor lo. Any temperature or impurity induced variations in the voltages across the displacement and reference coils, 54 and 56, are cancelled out by the division which creates the ratio voltage Vo. Thus, the outputVo is substantially independent of temperature or impurity effects.
