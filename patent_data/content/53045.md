# Regenerative gas turbine with water addition and method of operation thereof.

## Abstract
A method for adding water to heat exchanging system wherein heat recovery is carried out by way of a mixture which is obtained by adding liquid phase water to compress ed air or gas including air as the main part thereof which is used as combustion supporting gas, working medium gas or the like, or compressed gaseous fuel, if it is required, in the case such gaseous fuel is used as fuel, or by contacting the former with the latter, or heat recovery is carried out while adding the former to the latter or contacting the former with the latter, said method being characterized in that addition of water or contact of water is conducted by means of two or more contacting chambers under pressure located in series, water including non volatile substances being used in the first and intermediate contacting chambers, and pure water without obstructing the following procedures being used in the last contacting chamber.
