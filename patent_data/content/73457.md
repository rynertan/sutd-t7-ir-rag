# IGNITION DISTRIBUTOR WITH INDUCTION DETECTOR

## Abstract
The ignition distributor with induction detector is appro priate for internal combustion engines with electronic ignition and mechanical spark advance controls and is characterized in that the magnetic circuit is closed over a magnet 6 con nected immovably with the body 1 , a magnet pole shoe 8 , a sleeve 12 , an oscillating armature 13 with claw type pole shoes 14 , a variable gap 24 between the internal surface of a rotational armature 17 and the external surface of the claw type pole shoe 14 of the oscillating armature 13 , the rota tional armature 17 and a permanent gap 23 between the ex ternal surface of the rotational armature 17 and the internal surface of the magnet 6 . The sleeve 12 is disposed inside the coil and is coupled with a vacuum spark advance control 16 . The rotational armature 17 is fitted in the body 1 made of a non magnetic material, connected with the centrifugal gover nor 4 .
