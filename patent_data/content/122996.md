# Rotary web shearing machine.

## Abstract
A rotary web shearing machine for cutting a web into sheets comprises a pair of counter rotating rollers 6a, 6b provided with helical cutting blades 13, 14 and mounted on shafts 52, 51 rotatable in bearings 9 . Adjusting means is provided to move either one or both of the rollers axially to adjust the blades relative to each other to allow for wear, whilst the rollers continue to rotate, so that operation of the machine is not halted. In Figure 5, one shaft 51 is fixed against axial movement in a spherical bearing 54, 55 and the other shaft 52 is axially movable in its bearing 58, 59 . The axial movement is effected by rotation of a nut 63 engaged on a screw 64 , which bears on the shaft through a thrust bearing 60 . A releasable locking nut 69 prevents rotation of the adjusting nut 63 .
