# Low vibration level remote control gearshift linkage for manual transmission.

## Abstract
A remote control gear shift linkage system for a manual transmission comprises a manually operable control lever 4 , a control rod 2 connected between the control lever and the transmission for transmitting a movement of the control lever to the transmission to effect a gear shift, and a support rod 1 supported on a vehicle body for supporting the control lever. In order to avoid unwanted infuences of a resonance of the remote control linkage, a concentrated mass member 8 is fastened to a portion of the support rod. The concentrated mass member may takes the form of a sleeve fitted over the support rod or a solid bar fitted into the bore of the hollow support rod.
