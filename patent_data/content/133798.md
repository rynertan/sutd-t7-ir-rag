# Double base propellant compositions.

## Abstract
A double base propellant composition having well platonised ballistics at low burning rates consists of nitrog lycerine NG , nitrocellulose NC at least one lead compound and at least one copper II salt of an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid. The copper salt preferably comprises copper succinate, and the lead compound may include any of those known as ballistic modifiers in the propellant art. A preferred composi tion, having a platonised burning rate of 2.3 mm s ยน at a chamber pressure of 2 3 MPa, comprises by weight 35.1 NC 12.6 nitrogen , 41.6 NG, 8.3 triacetin, 10.7 sucrose octa acetate, 0.3 2 nitrodiphenylamine, 1.2 p nitromethylaniline, 1.0 copper II succinate and 1.8 lead acetophthalate.
