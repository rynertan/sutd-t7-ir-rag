# A protective shield to protect the eyes against vivid light such as a welders mask.

## Abstract
A protection shield, e.g. a welders mask, has an only slightly transparent screen 5 such as a welder s glass movable in front of and away from an opening 2 in the shield by a reversible electric motor 15 , driving the screen directly. The screen is guided by rods 6a, 6b in the shield, which it engages in only a few discrete points 7, 8 . Motor, screen and guides are easily removable from and insertable into the shield. This gives a simple and reliable structure with low energy re quirement. There are provisions for charging a battery 27 energizing the motor 15 either by solar cells 40 or by an ex ternal source. A hand operated switch 31 is provided with means 33 to be carried on a finger of the user, which switch operates the screen. A spatter glass 4 is taken up in the shield in guides 3 so as to be easily removable and replaceable and so that its thickness is not critical.
