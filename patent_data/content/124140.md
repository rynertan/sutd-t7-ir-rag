## Abstract
A method of manufacturing an optically readable in formation disc in which a disc shaped substrate of a synthetic resin which comprises an optically readable struc ture on at least one side is treated with an oxidising gas of reactive, electrically neutral particles and is then provided on the side of the structure with an electroless deposited re flection layer.
