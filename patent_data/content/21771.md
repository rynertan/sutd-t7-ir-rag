# AN IMPROVED REFRIGERATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A refrigeration system for a drink dispensing machine consists of a compressor which circulates a refrigerant through a closed circuit including an evaporator coil and a heat exchanger. A secondary heat exchanger is mounted within the evaporator coil so as to be cooled thereby and consists of a container through which the liquid, which is to form a drink, is passed. The container is provided adjacent one end with a liquid inlet and adjacent the opposite end with a liquid outlet, and baffles are mounted in the container to inhibit the direct flow of liquid between the inlet and the outlet. When carbonated drinks are to be supplied by the drink dispensing machine, a carbonator unit is mounted in the container and the supply of liquid to the carbonator is drawn from the liquid outlet of the container which forms the secondary heat exchanger.
