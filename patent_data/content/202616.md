## Description
The present invention relates to a method for color developing a silver halide photographic light sensitive material hereinafter referred to as light sensitive material , particularly to a novel method for developing a light sensitive material, which is not only hardly affected by the bromide ion concentration fluctuation caused by changes in the replenishing quantity and the influence of the evaporation of a processing solution, is capable of forming a dye image which is highly stable and excellent in the resistance against discoloration by light and produces little or no magneta color stain due to the mixing in of heavy metallic ions, and more particularly to a developing method which can be highly stably effected while only using a small amount of a replenisher. The processing of a light sensitive material consists basically of two processes color developing process and desilvering process, and the desilvering process consists of bleaching and fixing processes or of a bleach fix process. Besides, the processing includes some other additional processes such as rinsing process, and stabilizing process. In a color develoment, an exposed silver halide is reduced to become silver, and at the same time the oxidized product of an aromatic primary amine developing agent reacts with a coupler to form a dye. In this process, the halide ion produced in the field of the silver halide is dissolved out into the developing solution used and accumulated therein. Aside from this, components such as a development restrainer, contained in the silver halide photographic light sensitive material are also dissolved into the color developer solution and accumulated therein. In the desilvering process, the silver produced by the development is bleached by an oxidizing agent, and then all the silver salt is turned by a fixing agent into a soluble silver salt to be removed from the light sensitive material. In addition, a monobath bleach fix process that effects the bleaching process and fixing process simultaneously is also known. In the color developer solution, as is afore mentioned, such development restraining materials are gradually accumulated as a result of the development of the photographic light sensitive material, while the color developing agent and benzyl alcohol are consumed or accumulated into the photographic light sensitive material and carried out along with the light sensitive material, so that the concentrations of these components become lowered. Accordingly, a developing process for continuously processing a large quantity of silver halide photographic light sensitive materials by an automatic processor requires a means for maintaining each of the components of the color developer solution in a given concentration range in order to avoid changes in the finished characteristics by changes in the concentrations of the components. Usually used as such means is a method for replenishing the developer solution with a replenisher for the purpose of making up for the shortage of the consumed components and diluting the undesirably increased components. However, the replenishment causes necessarily a large amount of overflows and discharges of the developer solution, so that the method has now become a vital issue from the economical and environmental pollution point of view. Accordingly, in order to lessen the amount of the above mentioned overflow, the use of a smaller amount of a concentrated replenisher, i.e., the high concentration low replenishment method, has become polular, and aside from this, a method for adding a recycling agent to the overflow liquid to reuse the liquid as a replenisher has been proposed and now made practical reality. The above described methods are for substantially reducing the replenishing quantity. If the replenishing quantity is extremely reduced, the concentrations of the organic restrainer and halide ions being dissolved out into the developer solution are to be largely affected not only by only a small error in the replenishing quantity but also by the condensation of the solution due to its evaporation, thus usually resulting in the increase in the concentration of the foregoing exhaust accumulation. For example, such phenomena result in the problems that the increase in the halide ion concentration restrains the developing reaction, and the foot portion of the characteristic curve of the light sensitive material being restained thereby results in the formation of an extremely high contrast image. In order to avoid this, a method has been proposed which is such that the halide ion is removed from the overflow liquid by use of an ion exchange resin of electrodialysis and then to the liquid is added a recycling agent for making up for the shortage of the components consumed by development or in the recycling process to thereby reuse the liquid as a replenising liquid. The recycling by such an ion exchange resin or electrodialysis and the high concentration low replenishment method have the disadvantage that they are subject to the influence of evaporation or of the recycling operation and undergo the change in the bromide ion concentration, and besides, the difference in the processing quantity of the light sensitive material, particularly the difference between the beginning of week in which the number of processing orders increases and the weekend in which the number of processing orders decreases or between the high season and the off season, appear to the extent of up to a proportion of 1 5, and in addition they are also affected by the difference in the replenishing quantity as well as by evaporation, thus causing the composition of the developer solution to become largely differed. Therefore, in the low replenishment method and the recycling method an effort should be made to maintain the composition constant by conducting a quantitative analysis each time of recycling, but practicing the recycling or low replenishment process may, in most cases, be difficult for those processing labs or small scale photofinishers having no special skill for the analysis. The foregoing problems are due mainly to changes in the bromide ion, a development restrainer. To improve this, for example, there have been those proposals to reduce the silver bromide content of the photographic light sensitive material to thereby decrease the accumulated amount of bromide ions or to lessen the bromide ion concentration s fluctuation due to evaporation or to an error in the replenishing quantity as described in Japanese Patent Publication open to Public Inspection hereinafter referred to as Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos.173189 1984 and 205540 1984 . Such problems may be expected to be solved, e.g., by improving the developability through making smaller the average grain size of the silver halide contained in the photographic light sensitive material or lowering the coating amount of silver. However, in a color developer solution containing a conventional developing agent 3 methyl 4 amino N ethyl N β methanesulfonamidoethyl aniline, if the developability is improved, the development, on the contrary, is easily affected by the fluctuation of the bromide ion concentration in the developer, impairing the processing stability, thus giving the results contrary to the expectation. Nevertheless, it is essential that the processing stability is to be raised after the processing time is shortened. A conventional processing of a color photographic paper comprised substantially of silver chlorobromide emulsions comprises color developing at 33 C for 3 minutes and 30 seconds, bleach fix at 33 C for one minute and 30 seconds, washing for 3 minutes or stabilizing for 3 minutes , and drying, totalling about 8 minutes, which is regarded as usual processing period. Although the strong needs of the times lie in the foregoing low reprenishment process from the economical point of view, the short period processing is also strongly demanded from the standpoint of shortening the period for delivery. However, as has been mentioned, the expeiditing and the stabilizing of the processing or the low repenishment are reciprocal problems, which have trade off relations. That is, if the development is made with low replenishment, the concentration of the bromide ion as a restrainer and the concentration of a sulfur compound or mercapto compound as an emulsion stabilizer increase to impair not only the rapidness but also the stability of the development. However, various attempts have hitherto been made to expedite the color development. Particularly the foregoing developing agent, which has long been used as the most suitable agent for the development of silver chlorobromide emulsions, is slow in the permeation into the light sensitive material because of its low hydrophilicity. In order to quicken the permeation, various types of permeating agent have been investigated, and as a result, for example, a method for expediting the color development by the addition of benzyl alcohol to a color developer solution has now been extensively used. This method, however, has the disadvantage that as long a development time as more than three minutes at 33 C is required for an adequate color formation, and besides, the development is subject to the delicate influence of the bromide ion concentration. Increasing the pH of the color developer solution is also known as the method for improving the permeability, but it is disadvantageous in respect that, if the pH exceeds 10.5, the oxidation of the color developing agent is extremely accelerated, and the development becomes easily affected by changes in pH because of no suitable buffer available, and thus becomes unable to give any stable photographic characteristics or dependent largely upon the processing time. Increasing the quantity of the color developing agent in the color developer solution to raise the activity thereof is also known, but makes the developer solution costly because the developing agent is much expensive, and at the same time produces such instability that the foregoing agent is less soluble and is prone to be deposited, and thus cannot be used practically. On the other hand, other methods are known which, in order to carry out the speeding up of the color development, in advance incorporates a color developing agent into the light sensitive material, for example, a method which incorporates a color developing agent in the form of a metallic salt thereof into the light sensitive material is known as described in U.S. Patent No.3,719,419 . This method, however, is poor in the preservability of the light sensitive material, and has the disadvantage that it is fogged before use or otherwise prone to be fogged in the course of the color development process. Further, those methods as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,342,559 and Research Disclosure, 1976, No.15159 which incorporate into the light sensitive material a color developing agent, for example, in the form of a Schiff s salt in order to inactivate the amine portion thereof are also known. However, such methods have the disadvantage that the color developing agent can not start its color development until after its alkali hydrolysis, and on the contrary the method retards the color development. Further, the direct incorporation of a color developing agent into the light sensitive material has the disadvantage that the emulsion thereof tends to be fogged during the storage thereof due to the instability of the color developing agent, and in addition the incorporation causes various processing troubles due to the emulsion layer s physical quality weakened by the agent. In addition, the acceleration of development by the addition of a 3 pyrazolidone compound to a black and white developer solution containing a developing agent such as hydroquinone is known as described in, e.g., L.F.A. Mason, Photographic Processing Chemistry p.103 107, published by Focal Press, 1966 . The fact of incorporating the compound into the light sensitive material is described in British Patent No. 767,704. However, the techniques described in the above patent specification are of the incorporation of the compound into a black and white light sensitive material or into a reversal color light sensitive material, the purpose of which incorporation is to accelerate the black and white image alone of such light sensitive materials. And Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 52422 1978 describes the incorporation of a 3 pyrazolidone compound into a light sensitive material for the purpose of preventing the deterioration of the sensitivity of an unexposed color light sensitive material containing a two equivalent magenta coupler having in the active site thereof an oxy type organic split off group. These techniques, however, are not applicable to such the speeding up method characterized by stabilizing the color development in the low replenishment system. In order to expedite the color development by using conventionally known accelerating agents, those compounds have been investigated which are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,950,970, 2,515,147, 2,496,903, 4,038,075 and 4,119,462, British Patent Nos.1,430,998 and 1,455,413, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 15831 1978, 62450 1980, 62451 1980, 62452 1980 and 62453 1980, and Japanese Patent Examined Publication Nos. 12322 1976 and 49728 1980, but most of these compounds showed inadequate acceleration effects and the remaining showing high acceleration effects not only had the disadvantage of producing a fog but were unsuitable for improving the processing stability. The acceleration of the development by providing a silver halide emulsion layer substantially not light sensitive in the light sensitive material is known through the descriptions of Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 23225 1975 and 14236 1981, British Patent No. 1,378,577, and West German OLS Patent No. 2,622,922. The function of the emulsion layer is to adsorb development inhibitors such as the useless halogen and useless split off groups from the DIR couplers, DAR couplers, and the like, which all are released during the development, and is not to positively accelerate the developement, so that the emulsion layer showed little acceleration effects and no processing stability at all against the fluctuation of the bromide ion concentration, although it showed some effects against the fluctuation of the iodide ion concentration. On the other hand, the color developing rate is said to be different according to the type of paraphenylenediamine derivatives used and to depend upon the oxidation reduction potential of the developer solution used. Among such color developing agents the less soluble in water type color developing agent N alkyl substituted such as N,N diethyl p phenylenediamine sulfate, 3 methyl 4 amino N,N diethylaniline hydrochloride, or the like, although highly active in development and capable of accelerating development, is known to be undesirable because of the low dark discoloration characteristic of the formed dye therefrom after processing. Meanwhile, the 3 methyl 4 amino N ethyl N β methoxyethylaniline di p toluene sulfonate described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,656,950 and 3,658,525 said to be favorable in respect of being highly active in development is certainly excellent in the acceleration but is not suitable for use in the rapid developing process because of the disadvantage thereof that it has no ability to stabilize the bromide ion concentration and produces a significant yellow stain in the unexposed area of the processed photographic light sensitive material particularly the color developing agent remains when a short period development took place and thereby causes a coarse stain. On the other hand, 3 methyl 4 amino N ethyl β methanesulfonamidoetnylaniline sesquisulfate monohydrate and 3 methyl 4 amino N β hydroxyethylaniline sulfate, etc., having a water soluble alkylsulfonamido or hydroxyalkyl group introduced N alkyl group, as is described in Photographic Science and Engineering vol.8, No.3, May June 1964, p.125 137, have been said to be not so much different in the half wave potential showing oxidation reduction potential and to be both weak in the development activity. Accordingly, there are few or no color developing agents being substantially active in the development of a silver chlorobromide emulsion and excellent in making the resulting dye image stable in aging, and in general, the foregoing purpose has been accomplished to date only by the use of 3 methyl 4 amino N ethyl N β methanesulfonamidoethylaniline sulfate along with benzyl alcohol. In this instance, however, the development is subject to the influence of the change in the bromide ion concentration as previously stated. And the high concentration low replenishment processing using a reduced amount of a replenisher has another problem of the increase in the accumulation by the mixing in of other processing liquid components. This is because the renewal rate of the tank liquid by the replenisher is lowered due to the reduced quantity of the replenisher and also because the using period of the liquid is elongated. The mixing in of other liquid components is brought about by the splash of the adjacent liquid inside a processor, or the carrying of the processing liquid components immediately after development into the color developer solution by the film transport leader, belt or film hanger. etc., i.e., the so called back contamination . Of such accumulated mixed in components the thiosulfate ion as the fixing agent functions as a development accelerator. That is, this problem strongly occurs particularly when the light sensitive material is processed in a bleach fix bath immediately after color development. Especially, the mixing in of the thiosulfate ion accelerates the development of the shoulder portion of the photographic characteristic curve to thereby form a significantly high contrast image. And the increase in the mixing in of a metallic salt, particularly a ferric salt, accelerates the decomposition of hydroxylamine as a preservative to thereby produce ammonia ions. The decomposition reaction is largely accelerated at a temperature above 30 C. The ammonia ion, similarly to the thiosulfate ion, has the disadvantage of accelerating physical development to form a significantly high contrast image. For the above reasons, it is the status quo that realization of an improved color developer solution is strongly demanded which is capable of rapidly processing by being replenished with only a small amount of a replenisher capable of maintaining the photographic characteristics of a light sensitive material constant and also capable of stably processing a light sensitive material without decomposition of the components and change in the photographic processing characteristics even when used over an extensive period of time. It is therefore a first object of the present invention to provide a method of rapidly and stably processing a silver halide color photographic light sensitive material, the said method using a color developer solution which is capable of always maintaining given proper photographic characteristics constant over a long period without being affected by changes in the bromide ion concentration even when used for processing being replenished with a small amount of a replenisher, and also capapble of giving an image whose dye formed and non color formed portions will by no means fade away or discolor. We studied variously for achieving the above mentioned objects of the invention, they were resultantly successful in inventing a peculiar color developing agent almost not affected by a bromide ion concentration when developing a specific silver halide. However, they were confronted with such an obstacle that the resulted color developing dyes are lowered in preservation stability, and they further studied on how to solve this obstacle. As a result, we have now found that the above object can be accomplished by the following method In a method for developing a silver halide color photographic light sensitive material, said method comprising processing in a color developer solution containing an N hydroxyalkyl substituted p phenylenediamine derivative for a period of equal to or less than 150 seconds at a temperature of not less than 30 C a silver halide color photographic light sensitive material comprising light sensitive silver halide emulsion layers whose at least one layer is of a substantial silver chlorobromide emulsion, whose binder s layer swelling rate T 1 2 is equal to or less than 30 seconds. Figure 1 is a graph showing the layer swelling rate T 1 2 of the binder. We have found a surprising fact that, in developing a color photographic light sensitive material having a specific silver halide emulsion i.e., an emulsion comprised principally of silver chlorobromide particularly the silver bromide content is equal to or less than 90 mole , the formed dye s density is hardly changed against the change in the bromide ion concentration only when an N hydroxyalkyl substituted p phenylenediamine derivative is used as the color developing agent. The foregoing feature of the color developing agent cannot be obtained in those color photographic light sensitive materials having a substantial silver iodobromide emulsion containing not less than 0.5 mole silver iodide, and cannot be expected from the fact that color developing agents of this type have hitherto been exclusively used for the development of silver iodobromide emulsions particularly, the fact that, in developing a color photographic light sensitive material comprised substantially of a silver chlorobromide emulsion, the developing speed does not retard even when largely raising the bromide ion concentration is beyond our expectations, and the fact is not understood from the oxidation reduction potential and half wave potential of general color developing agents, and is probably impossible unless the optimum balance between the developing speed and the coupling speed is maintained and hence surprising. However, we have again encountered another obstacle. It is the fact that, where an N hydroxyalkyl substituted p phenylenediamine color developing agent is used, since the development can be carried out rapidly without being affected by changes in the bromide ion concentration, particularly under a high bromide ion concentration, it has the advantage that the replenishing quantity in a continuous processing can be largely reduced and the processing stability is significantly high, while on the other hand it has the disadvantage that the stability in aging, particularly the discoloration by light, of the resulting dye image is deteriorated. Deterioration of the stability in aging of the dye image, particularly in print materials, is a fatal blow, so that this is a large obstacle. As a result of our continued effort to solve this question, we have found out that the above disadvantage is caused not by the deterioration of the stability in aging of the dye itself but by the tendency of the color developing agent to remain in the color photographic light sensitive material, and this question can be solved particularly by shortening the color developing period of time. And we have ascertained that, although the shortening of the color developing period cannot be accomplished unless the developability of the color photographic light sensitive material is adequately improved and therefore cannot be made unconditionally, realization of a higher development stability with use of a less quantity of replenisher without impairing the preservability of the formed dye image is accomplished on condition that the color developer solution of the present invention is used to make a development at a temperature of equal to or more than 30 C for not longer than 150 seconds. In this instance, however, there occurs another problem that, where a photographic light sensitive material of the conventional type is used, the foregoing developing period is too short to obtain an adequate photographic image. Hereupon, we have further investigated and, in order to carry out the low replenishment processing by use of the color developing agent of the present invention without being affected by changes in the bromide ion concentration, improved the developing speed by processing a color photographic light sensitive material the silver halide emulsion of at least one layer, preferably the whole light sensitive emulsion layers, of which is substantially a silver chlorobromide emulsion whose binder s layer swelling rate T 1 2 is equal to or less than 30 seconds in and by a developer solution containing a N hydroxyalkyl substituted p phenylenediamine derivative. The above color photographic light sensitive material is rapidly processed in the color developer solution of this invention at a temperature of equal to or more than 30 C for not more than 150 seconds, whereby a rapid, highly stable and low replenishment processing can be carried out without affecting the stability of the resulting dye image, and thus we have succeeded in accomplishing the foregoing object of the present invention. In this specification, the silver chlorobromide implies that a slight amount of silver iodide is allowed to be contained in addition to silver chlorobromide for example, not more than 0.3 mole , more preferably not more than 0.1 mole silver iodide is allowed to be contained. In this invention, however, a silver chlorobromide containing no silver iodide is most preferred. The present invention will be further detailed below The layer swelling rate T 1 2 of the binder for the photographic component layers of the silver halide color photographic light sensitive material of the present invention is equal to or less than 30 seconds and, although desirable to be as much small as possible, not allowed to be less than 2 seconds because, if less than the lower limit, the binder tends to produce a scratch trouble without being hardened, and particularly preferably equal to or less than 20 seconds, and most preferably equal to or less than 15 seconds. If more than 30 seconds, not only does the stability in aging of the formed dye image become deteriorated but no adequate dye formation can be obtained within 30 seconds. Adjustment of the coat swelling rate T 1 2 can be made according to the using quantity of a hardening agent. As for the light sensitive emulsion layers of the silver halide color photographic light sensitive material to be processed according to the present invention, at least one layer of the light sensitive emulsion layers should be substantially of a silver chlorobromide emulsion, and preferably the whole light sensitive emulsion layers should be of a silver chlorobromide emulsion. The smaller the silver bromide content mole of the silver chlorobromide, the more adequately is the dye formed even when the color developing period is shorter, and therefore the silver bromide content is desirable to be equal to or less than 90 mole , and most preferably from 40 mole to 70 mole this range leads to the best results. Further, the smallest possible coating amount of silver is desirable in respect that there occurs no retard of the development by the increase in the bromide and adequate dye formation can take place even in a short period, and the best effect can be obtained where the coating silver amount is not more than 1g m², and preferably from 0.1 to not more than 0.8g m², and most preferably from 0.2 to 0.7g m². The color development should take place at a temperature of equal to or more than 30 C for not more than 150 seconds, preferably equal to or more than 33 C for not more than 120 seconds, and most preferably equal to or more than 35 C for not more than 90 seconds. If the development is made at a temperature of more than 30 C for more than 150 seconds, the stability in aging of the formed dye becomes deteriorated. Particularly the developing period of time is more important than the temperature and, if it exceeds 150 seconds, the discoloration by light of the formed cyan dye is undesirably increased. The processing time is preferably 5 to 150 sec, and most preferably 10 to 110 sec. The purpose of using such the high developing temperature is to complete the development in a short time rather than for the stability in aging of the developed dye, and, if within the temperature range of from 33 to 50 C, the higher the temperature the more desirable because a shorter period development is possible. The particularly preferred temperature range is from 33 C to 48 C, and most preferably from 35 C to 43 C. Examples of the developing agent useful in the present invention are quaternary ammoniam salts of N hydroxyalkyl substituted p phenylenediamine compounds, and particularly those having the following general formula wherein R₁₀₁ is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or an alkoxy group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms R₁₀₂ is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms R₁₀₃ is a hydroxyl group substitutable alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms A is an alkyl group having at least one hydroxyl group and being allowed to have a branched chain, and is more preferably wherein R₁₀₄, R₁₀₅ and R₁₀₆ each is a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group or an alkyl group being allowed to have a hydroxyl group and having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, provided that at least one of the R₁₀₄, R₁₀₅ and R₁₀₆ is a hydroxyl group or an alkyl group having a hydroxyl group n₁, n₂ and n₃ each is an integer of zero, 1, 2 or 3 and HX₁₀₁ represents hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, nitric acid or phosphoric acid. Such the p phenylenediamine color developing agent, because it is unstable in the free amine form, is generally used in the form of a salt most generally, in the above defined form . The typical examples of the developing agent include In the present invention, The preferred The hydrochlorides, sulfates and p toluenesulfonates of the above compounds 1 through 8 are particularly preferred. Of these exemplified compounds the compounds 1 , 2 , 6 , 7 and 8 are more preferred, the 1 , 2 and 6 are specially preferred, and further, the 1 is most suitably usable in this invention. Since the solubility of these color developing agents in water is significantly high, the using quantity thereof is preferably from 1g to 100g per liter of the processing solution, and more preferably from 3g to 30g. These N hydroxyalkyl substituted p phenylenediamine derivatives may be easily sysnthesized in accordance with the methods described in the Journal of American Chemical Society Vol.73, Item 3100 1951 . The bromide ion concentration of the color developer solution of this invention is preferred to be more than 5x10 ³, and in this invention the highest possible bromide ion concentration is favorable because the replenishing quantity can be so much lowered. In those conventional developing processes, since the bromide restrains the developing reaction, the smaller the bromide ion concentration, the more desirable. In the combination of the color photographic light sensitive material with the color developer solution of the present invention, quite contrary to the above, the higher the bromide content the more preferred and the better is the object of the present invention accomplished. In other words, in this invention, the process in the above combination is hardly affected by bromide, the replenishing amount can be lowered. The bromide content is preferably equal to or more than 1x10 ² mole, and particularly preferably equal to or more than 1.5x10 ². The bromide ion concentration, if too high, restrains the development, so that more than 6x10 ², the point at which the influence of the bromide ion concentration begins to appear, is undesirable. In addition, the development is not affected by the chloride concentration. In the case of carrying our a continuous process in the methods of the invention, the developer replenishment may be used in an amount of not more than 250ml per sq. m of a silver halide color light sensitive material processed, and, more preferably, not more than 200ml, and most preferably from 20 to 80ml. The color photographic light sensitive material of this invention exhibits the best effect when, in a multilayer color photographic light sensitive material comprising three or more layers including blue sensitive, green sensitive and red sensitive emulsion layers, 1 2 of the period required for the layers swelling time to become the maximum i.e., the coat swelling rate T 1 2 is equal to or less than 30 seconds. The total thickness of the layers should be not more than 14µm, preferably not more than 13µm, and particularly preferably not more than 12µm, and in any of these cases the T 1 2 is desirable to be equal to or less than 30 seconds.

Examples representative of the particularly preferred spectral sensitization method include those methods as described in Japanese Patent Examined Publication Nos. 4936 1968, 22884 1968, 18433 1970, 37443 1972, 28293 1973, 6209 1974 and 12375 1978, and Japanese Patent O.P.I.

In order to incorporate such sensitizing dyes into the silver halide emulsion of this invention, the dye is used in the form of a dye solution prepared by in advance dissolving the dye into a hydrophilic organic solvent such as methyl alochol, ethyl alcohol, acetone, dimethylformamide or such a fluorinated alcohol as described in Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 40659 1975. The addition of the dye may be arbitrarily made in the beginning of, during, or after the chemical ripening of the silver halide emulsion, or, as the case may be, the addition may take place in a process immediately before the emulsion coating. The green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer of this invention contains a pyrazolotriazole type magenta coupler of this invention, and may also contain in combination a different magenta coupler other than the one of this invention, provided that the non invention magenta coupler is desirable to be used in a quantity of less than 45 mole of the total amount of the whole couplers.

The silver halide emulsion layers and other photographic component layers of the photographic light sensitive material of the present invention may also contain in combination those couplers including non diffusible DIR compounds, colored magenta or cyan couplers, polymer couplers, and diffusible DIR compounds. As for the non diffusible DIR compounds and colored magenta or cyan couplers, reference can be made to the descriptions of our Japanese Patent Application No. 193611 1984, and as for the polymer couplers, reference can be made to the descriptions of our Japanese Patent Application No. 172151 1984. The adding quantity of any of the above couplers usable in this invention, although not definitive, may be preferably from 1x10 ³ to 5 moles per mole of silver, and more preferably from 1x10 ¹ to 5x10 ¹. The incorporation of any of the pyrazolotriazole magenta couplers of this invention into the silver halide emulsion layer of this invention, if the coupler is alkali soluble, may be made in the form of an alkaline solution, and, if the coupler is oil soluble, is desirable to be made in the form of a finely particulate dispersion liquid thereof prepared by dispersing a solution thereof dissolved into a high boiling solvent, if necessary, in combination with a low boiling solvent. In this instance, if necessary, a hydroquinone derivative, ultraviolet absorbing agent, and anti discoloration agent, may also be used in combination. And, two or more different pyrazolotriazole type magenta couplers of this invention may be used in combination. Further, referring in detail to the adding procedure favorable in this invention of the pyrazolotriazole type magenta couplers of the present invention, one or two or more of the pyrazolotriazole type magenta couplers of the present invention, if necessary, together with other couplers, hydroquinone derivative, anti discoloration agent, and ultraviolet absorbing agent, are dissolved into a high boiling solvent, any one of those including organic amides, carbamates, esters, ketones, urea derivatives, ethers, and hydrocarbons, such as di n butyl phthate, tricresyl phosphate, triphenyl phosphate, di isooctyl azelate, di n butyl sebacate, tri n hexyl phosphate, N,N di ethyl caprylamidobutyl, N,N diethyl laurylamide, n pentadecylphenyl ether, dioctyl phthalate, n nonyl phenol, 3 pentadecylphenyl ether, 2,5 di sec amylphenylbutyl ether, monophenyl di o chlorophenyl phosphate, or paraffin fluoride, and or a low boiling solvent such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate, butyl propionate, cyclohexanol, diethylene glycol monoacetate, nitromethane, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, cyclohexanetetrahydrofuran, methyl alcohol, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dioxane, or methyl ethyl ketone, and the solution is then mixed with an aqueous solution containing an anionic surfactant such as an alkylbenzenesulfonic acid or alkylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, and or a nonionic surfactant such as sorbitansesquioleic acid ester or sorbitanmonolauric acid ester, and or a hydrophilic binder such as gelatin, and the mixture is subsequently emulsifiedly dispersed by means of a high speed rotary mixer, colloid mill or ultrasonic disperser, and then added to the silver halide emulsion. Alternatively, the above couplers may also be dispersed by using the latex dispersion method. The latex dispersion method for the couplers and the effect thereof are described in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 74538 1974, 59943 1976 and 32552 1979, and Research Disclosure, Aug. 1976, No. 14850, p.77 79. Appropriate latexes for use in the method include those homopolymers, copolymers and terpolymers of such monomers as, e.g., styrene, acrylates, n butyl acrylate, n butyl methacrylate, 2 acetoacetoxyethyl methacrylate, 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl trimethylammoniummethosulfate, sodium 3 methacryloyloxy propane 1 sulfonate, N isopropylacrylamide, N 2 2 methyl 4 oxopentyl acrylamide, and 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid. The silver halide color photographic light sensitive material of this invention may contain further various other photographic additives such as those described in Reseach Disclosure No. 17643, including antifoggants, stabilizers, ultraviolet absorbing agents, antistain agents, brightening agents, anti color image discoloration agents, antistatic agents, hardening agents, surface active agents, plasticizers, and wetting agents. Examples of the hydrophilic colloid for used in the preparation of the emulsion for the silver halide color photographic light sensitive material of this invention include gelatin, gelatin derivatives, graft polymers of gelatin with other high molecular materials proteins such as albumin, and casein cellulose derivatives such as hydroxyethyl cellulose derivatives, and carboxymethyl cellulose derivatives starch derivatives and synthetic hydrophilic high molecular materials comprising homo or co polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylimidazole, and polyacrylamide. Materials for the support of the silver halide color photographic light sensitive material of this invention include, e.g., baryta paper, polyethylene coated paper, polypropylene synthetic paper, reflective layer coated or reflective material provided transparent support materials using, e.g., glass plates, cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate polyester film such as polyethylene terephthalate polyamide film, polycarbonate film, and polystyrene film. And other usually used any transparent materials may also be applied. These support materials are to be selectively used according to the purpose for which the light sensitive material is used. The coating of the silver halide emulsion layers and other photographic component layers used in this invention may be carried out by use of various coating methods such as the dipping coating, air doctor coating, and curtain coating, and may also be made by those two or more layers simultaneously coating methods as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,761,791 and 2,491,898. In the present invention, the coating positions of the respective emulsion layers may be settled arbitrarily. For example, in the case of a light sensitive material for making full color photographic prints, it is desirable to arrange emulsion layers in the order of a blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and red sensitive emulsion layer from the support side. These light sensitive silver halide emulsion layers each may be comprised of two or more layers. And the effect of the present invention is largely exhibited when all these light sensitive silver halide emulsion layers are substantially of a silver chlorobromide emulsion. Examples of the present invention will be detailed below. The embodiments of this invention are not restricted to and by the examples. On a polyethylene laminated paper support were coated the following layers in order from the support side, whereby silver halide color photographic light sensitive material samples No.1 through No.25 were prepared. Layer 1 ... A blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing 1.2g m² of gelatin, 0.32g m² in terms of silver, and the same shall apply hereinafter of a blue sensitive silver halide gelatin emulsion of which the silver halide composition and the average grain size are shown in Table 1 and 0.80g m² of a yellow coupler hereinafter called RY 1 dissolved in 0.50g m² of dioctyl phthalate. Layer 2 ... An interlayer comprising 0.70g m² of gelatin, 10 mg m² of an antiirradiation dye hereinafter called AI 1 and 5 mg m² of AI 2 . Layer 3 ... A green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing 1.25g m² of gelatin, 0.28g m² of a green sensitive silver halide gelatin emulsion of which the silver halide composition and the average grain size are shown in Table 1 and 0.62g m² of a magenta coupler hereinafter called RM 1 dissolved in 0.30g m² of dioctyl phthalate. Layer 4 ... An interlayer comprising 1.2g m² of gelatin. Layer 5 ... A red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing 1.4g m² of gelatin, 0.26g m² of a red sensitive silver halide gelatin emulsion of which the silver halide composition and the average grain size are shown in Table 1 and 0.45g m² of a cyan coupler hereinafter called RC 1 dissolved in 0.20g m² of dioctyl phthalate. Layer 6 ... A protective layer containing 0.50g m² of gelatin. There used the respective silver halides increased in colors by making use of ordinary spectral sensitizing dyes in the blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, the green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and the red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, respectively. In addition, sodium 2,4 dichloro 6 hydroxy S triazine as a hardening agent was added to Layers 2, 4 and 6 in a quantity of 0.02g per gram of gelatin in the respective layers, and after that, the resulting light sensitive material was tested with respect to the layer swelling rate T 1 2, using the following color developer solution, and as a result, the value of T 1 2 was 7 seconds. The measurement was made by use of a Levenson type swellometer. Each of the light sensitive material samples No.1 through No.25 given in Table 1 was exposed through an optical wedge to light, and then processed in the following procedure The compositions of the respective processing baths are as follows Aside from the above, the same samples No.1 through No.25 were processed in the same manner except that the concentration. 0.6g liter, of the potassium bromide in the above color developer solution was changed to 1.5g liter and 3.5g liter. The processed samples each was subjected to sensitometry test in usual manner. The density of the exposure range in the proximity of the density 1.0 of each sample when the concentration of potassium bromide is 0.6g liter was regarded as 100, and changes in the density when the concentration of potassium bromide was thus changed are shown in relative values to the 100 in Table 1. In addition, the processed color densities comparative data are given with respect to the cyan densities alone in Table 1. As is apparent from the results shown in Table 1. Samples No.13 through No.25 whose silver halide is substantial silver chlorobromide and whose emulsion contains Exemplified Compound 1 or 2 as the color developing agent of this invention show little changes in the formed color density and therefore show high processing stability even when the bromide ion concentration in the color developer solution is changed from 0.5g liter to 1.5g liter and 3.5g liter as compared to Samples No.1 through No.12 whose silver halide is not substantial silver chlorobromide. In contrast, where Conventional Color Developing Agent CD 3 or CD 6 was used, there is the disadvantage that every processed sample, regardless of the silver halide composition, shows the formed color density deteriorated according to the increase in the bromide ion concentration in the color developer solution. In addition, Table 1 shows that, in this invention, the replenishing quantity can be significantly reduced, since it shows that the processing took place with a less replenishing quantity with the increase in the bromide ion concentration. Silver halide photographic light sensitive material Sample No.20 was used and processed using the same processing solutions and exposed in the same manner as in Example 1 except that color developer solutions prepared with the color developing agent varied as shown in Table 2 were used, and the color developing took place at 38 C for periods varied as shown in Table 2. The resulted samples were stored at 70 C and 90 RH and the variations of the red color density thereof were then measured. Table 2 exhibits the measurement results of the respective density lowerings in a density range selected when the initial density 1.0 of each sample was lowered by the order of about 0.3 by using CD 3 every processing time to serve as a color developing agent, such density range was the same as that obtained by processing each sample with the other color developers. Table 2 also exhibits the measurement results of the stain density in the unexposed areas of each of the same samples. As is apparent from the results in Table 2, where the color developer solution contains Color Developing Agent CD 3 or CD 6, no large difference in the discoloration rate between the agents is recognized whatever the color developing time seconds may be, but CD 6 is larger in the discoloration than CD 3. The same thing is true to the yellow stain density Dmin in the unexposed area. On the other hand, as for the color developing agent, Exemplified Compound 1 or 2 of the present invention, where the color developing time exceeds 180 seconds, the discoloration increases and the preservability in aging becomes significantly deteriorated. The same thing is true also to the yellow stain density Dmin in the unexposed area. However, where the color developing time is less than 150 seconds, the preservability in aging is drastically improved to give more favorable results than in the case where the above CD 3 is used. This fact is surprising beyond the saying that the structure of the formed dye has close relations with the stability of the dye. The remaining of the color developing agent in the layer is assumed to also largely relate to the fact. The respective silver halides of Samples No.3 and No.20 were used to prepare samples each having blue , green and red sensitive emulsion layers coated so that the silver halide coating quantities are the same as those used in Example 1, and containing variously varied quantities of a hardening agent. These samples, after being dried, were immersed in the foregoing color developer solution at a measured temperature of 35 C and measure with respect to the layer swelling rate T 1 2 by means of a Levenson type swellometer. From these samples those having swelling rates T 1 2 of 2 seconds, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 60 seconds, 90 seconds and 120 seconds were selected and used. These selected samples each was exposed in the same manner as in Example 1 and processed in the same processing solutions as those used in Example 1. The maximum cyan density obtained when each sample was color developed for 10 minutes at 38 C was regarded as 100, and the processing period of time required for the maximum density of each sample to be 80 is given in Table 3. The results represent the rapidness of the development completing point of time. As is apparent from the results in Table 3, where the silver halide is silver chloride, if the color developing agent used is of this invention and the layer swelling rate T 1 2 is less than 30 seconds, the development completing time time up to reaching the Dmax of 80 is very short, so that rapid processing is possible. On the other hand, even though the color developing agent of this invention is used, if the layer swelling rate T 1 2 exceeds 40 seconds, the development completing reaching time becomes drastically longer, while on the other hand, in the case of the non invention color developing agents, even if the layer swelling rate T 1 2 is very small, no rapid development completing reaching time are obtained. Meanwhile, where the silver halide is substantial silver iodobromide, even thought the color developing agent used is of this invention, no rapid development completing reaching time can be obtained regardless of whether the layer swelling rate T 1 2 is longer or shorter. The silver halide photographic light sensitive material samples No.3 and No.20 of Example 1 were used to prepare samples each having blue , green and red sensitive emulsion layers by coating so that each layer has the same quantity of silver and the total coating amounts of silver of the respective samples are 0.4g m², 0.75g m², 1.0g m², 2g m², 3g m², 5g m² and 7g m². The layer swelling rate T 1 2 of each sample was 8 seconds. The quantities of the couplers used in Example 1 were applied intact to the sample containing the total amounts of silver of 1.0g m², and to the other samples were used the couplers in quantities relative to the respective total amounts of silver thereof. As for processing solutions, the same ones were used with the exception of the color developing agent varied in the same way as in Examples 1, 2 and 3. Regarding the bromide ion concentration, 1.5g liter of potassium bromide were used. The maximum density obtained when each sample is processed in each color developer solution at 38 C for 10 minutes is regarded as 100, and a processing period of time required for the maximum density to be 80 was measured, and the results, the obtained development completing time time up to reaching the Dmax of 80 , are shown in Table 4 in the same way as in Example 3. As is apparent from Table 4, it is understood that, even in the processing method of this invention, as the total amounts of silver largely increases, the development completing time tends to become drastically longer, but the development completing time in this invention is still much shorter than that of the comparative processing. On a polyethylene laminated paper support were coated the following layers in order from the support side, whereby silver halide color photographic light sensitive material samples No.101 through No.125 were prepared. Layer 1... A blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer comprising 0.30g silver equivalent the same shall apply hereinafter of a blue sensitive silver halide gelatin emulsion the silver halide composition and the average grain size thereof are given in Table 1 containing 1.1g m² of gelatin and a solution of 0.82g m² of an yellow coupler RY 1 dissolved in 0.48g m² of dioctyl phthalate. Layer 2... An interlayer comprising 0.72g m² of gelatin, and 15mg m² of an antiiradiation dye. Layer 3... A green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer comprising 0.29g m² silver equivalent of a green sensitive silver halide gelatin emulsion the silver halide composition and the average grain size are given in Table 1 containing 1.25g m² of gelatin, and a solution of 0.60g m² of magenta coupler Exemplified Compound M 18 dissolved into 0.30g of dioctyl phthalate. Layer 4... An interlayer comprising 1.2g m² of gelatin. Layer 5... A red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer comprising 0.26g m² silver equivalent of a red sensitive silver halide gelatin emulsion the silver halide composition and the average grain size are given in Table 1 containing 1.3g m² of gelatin, and solution of 0.46g m² of Cyan Coupler RC 2 dissolved into 0.21g m² of dioctyl phthalate. Layer 6... A protective layer comprising 0.49g m² of gelatin. In addition, the above blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer were spectrally sensitized by appropriate sensitizing dyes which are generally used. In addition, sodium 2,4 dichloro 6 hydroxy S triazine as a hardening agent was added to Layers 2, 4 and 6 in a quantity of 0.02g per gram of gelatin in the respective layers, and after that, the resulting light sensitive material was tested with respect to the layer swelling rate T 1 2, using the following color developer solution, and as a result, the value of T 1 2 was 8 seconds. The measurement was made in the same manner as in Example 1. Each of the light sensitive material samples No.1 through No.25 given in Table 1 was exposed through an optical wedge to light, and then processed in the same procedure as in Example 1. Aside from the above, the same samples No.1 through No.25 were processed in the same manner except that the concentration, 0.6g liter, of the potassium bromide in the above color developer solution was changed to 1.5g liter and 3.5g liter. The processed samples each was subjected to sensitometry test in usual manner. The density of the exposure range in the proximity of the density 1.0 of each sample when the concentration of potassium bromide is 0.6g liter was regarded as 100, and changes in the density when the concentration of potassium bromide was thus changed are shown in relative values to the 100 in Table 5. In addition, the processed color densities comparative data are given with respect to the cyan densities alone in Table 5. As is apparent from the results shown in Table 5, Samples No.113 through No.125 whose silver halide is substantial silver chlorobromide and whose emulsion contains Exemplified Compound 1 or 2 as the color developing agent of this invention show little changes in the formed color density and therefore show high processing stability even when the bromide ion concentration in the color developer solution is changed from 0.6g liter to 1.5g liter and 3.5g liter as compared to Samples No.101 through No.112 whose silver halide is not substantial silver chlorobromide. In contrast, where Conventional Color Developing Agent CD 3 or CD 6 was used, there is the disadvantage that every processed sample, regardless of the silver halide composition, shows the formed color density deteriorated according to the increase in the bromide ion concentration in the color developer solution. In addition, Table 5 shows that, in this invention, the replenishing quantity can be significantly reduced, since it shows that the processing took place with a less replenishing quantity with the increase in the bromide ion concentration. Silver halide photographic light sensitive material Sample No.121 was used and processed using the same processing solutions and exposed in the same manner as in Example 5 except that color developer solutions prepared with the color developing agent varied as shown in Table 6 were used, and the color developing took place at 38 C for periods varied as shown in Table 6. The processed samples each was aged under the illumination of a xenon lamp light and changes in the cyan density were measured. That is, where the initial density 1.0 of each sample processed for each developing period in the developer containing Developing Agent CD 3 is reduced by about 0.3, the density deterioration of the same density region of the same sample processed in the other color developer containing the other Developing Agent CD 6 was measured and are shown in Table 6. At that time, the same sample s unexposed portion s yellow stain was measured and is also shown in Table 6. As is apparent from the results in Table 6, where the color developer solution contains Color Developing Agent CD 3 or CD 6, no large difference in the discoloration rate between the agents is recognized whatever the color developing time seconds may be, nut CD 6 is larger in the discoloration than CD 3. The same thing is true to the yellow stain density Dmin in the unexposed area. On the other hand, as for the color developing agent, Exemplified Compound 1 or 2 of the present invention, where the color developing time exceeds 180 seconds, the discoloration increases and the preservability in aging becomes significantly deteriorated. The same thing is true also to the yellow stain density Dmin in the unexposed area. However, where the color developing time is less than 150 seconds, the preservability in aging is drastically improved to give more favorable results than in the case where the above CD 3 is used. This fact is surprising beyond the saying that the structure of the formed dye has close relations with the stability of the dye. The remaining of the color developing agent in the layer is assumed to also largely relate to the fact. The respective silver halides of Samples No.103 and No.121 were used to prepare samples each having blue , green and red sensitive emulsion layers coated so that the silver halide coating quantities are the same as those used in Example 1, and containing variously varied quantities of a hardening agent. These samples, after being dried, were immersed in the foregoing color developer solution at a measured temperature of 30 C and measure with respect to the layer swelling rate T 1 2 in the same manner as in Example 1. From these samples those having swelling rates T 1 2 of 2 seconds, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 60 seconds, 90 seconds and 120 seconds were selected and used. These selected samples each was exposed in the same manner as in Example 1 and processed in the same processing solutions as those used in Example 1. The maximum cyan density obtained when each sample was color developed for 10 minutes at 38 C was regarded as 100, and the processing period of time required for the maximum density of each sample to be 80 is given in Table 3. The results represent the rapidness of the development completing point of time. As is apparent from the results in Table 7, where the silver halide is silver chloride, if the color developing agent used is of this invention and the layer swelling rate T 1 2 is less than 30 seconds, the development completing time time up to reaching the Dmax of 80 is very short, so that rapid processing is possible. On the other hand, even though the color developing agent of this invention is used, if the layer swelling rate T 1 2 exceeds 40 seconds, the development completing reaching time becomes drastically longer, while on the other hand, in the case of the non invention color developing agents, even if the layer swelling rate T 1 2 is very small, no rapid development completing reaching time are obtained. Meanwhile, where the silver halide is substantial silver iodobromide, even thought the color developing agent used is of this invention, no rapid development completing reaching time can be obtained regardless of whether the layer swelling rate T 1 2 is longer or shorter. The silver halide photographic light sensitive material samples No.103 and No.121 of Example 5 were used to prepare samples each having blue , green and red sensitive emulsion layers by coating so that each layer has the same quantity of silver and the total coating amounts of silver of the respective samples are 0.4g m², 0.75g m², 1.0g m², 2g m², 3g m², 5g m² and 7g m². The layer swelling rate T 1 2 measured at a processing temperature of 30 C of each sample was 8 seconds. The quantities of the couplers used in Example 5 were applied intact to the sample containing the total amounts of silver of 1.0g m², and to the other samples were used the couplers in quantities relative to the respective total amounts of silver thereof. As for processing solutions, the same ones were used with the exception of the color developing agent varied in the same way as in Examples 5, 6 and 7. Regarding the bromide ion concentration, 1.5g liter of potassium bromide were used. The maximum density obtained when each sample is processed in each color developer solution at 38 C for 10 minutes is regarded as 100, and a processing period of time required for the maximum density to be 80 was measured, and the results, the obtained development completing time time up to reaching the Dmax of 80 , are shown in Table 8 in the same way as in Example 7. As is apparent from Table 8, it is understood that, even in the processing method of this invention, as the total amounts of silver largely increases, the development completing time tends to become drastically longer, but the development completing time in this invention is still much shorter than that of the comparative processing. Color photographic paper samples were prepared in the same manner as in the samples of Example 5 except that the magenta coupler of the color photographic paper samples of Example 5 was replaced by the couplers shown in Table 9. These samples each was processed in the same manner as in Example 5. On the other hand, to the used color developer solution was added a bleach fix solution so that the iron ion content of the solution is 3ppm, and the liquid was allowed to stand in a beaker with its mouth open for five days. After that, this color developer liquid was used to develop the samples in the same way. And the difference between the magenta color stain densities on the unexposed area of each of the processed color paper samples before and after the aging of the color developer solution was measured by using a densitometer. The measured results are given in Table 9. As is apparent from Table 9, it is understood that the use of these couplers having Formula I of this invention produces little magenta stain attributed to the mixing in of heavy metallic ions as compared to those well known pyrazolone type couplers such as the ones used in comparative examples, and further, the use of the developing agent of this invention N hydroxyalkyl substituted p phenylenediamine derivative in combination with the above coupler is very effective in restraining particularly the occurrence of magenta stain. This fact implies that the color developer solution of this invention, even when heavy metallic ions are mixed therein the iron ion in the bleach fix bath or from the water used for the preparation of the color developer solution is mixed in , causes little visually conspicuous magenta stain to appear in the white background portion, thus giving stable processing characteristics. On a polyethylene laminated paper support, the following layers were coated in order from the support side, whereby silver halide color photographic light sensitive material samples No.201 through No.225 were prepared. Layer 1 ... A blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing 1.5g m² of gelatin, a blue sensitive silver halide gelatin emulsion of which the silver halide composition and the average grain size are shown in Table 1 in an amount of 0.35g m² in terms of the silver content thereof, and so forth on , and 1.0g m² of an exemplified yellow coupler compound Y 6 dissolved in 0.50g m² of dioctyl phthalate. Layer 2 ... An interlayer comprising 0.70g m² of gelatin. Layer 3 ... A green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing 1.30g m² of gelatin, a green sensitive silver halide gelatin emulsion of which the silver halide composition and the average grain size are shown in Table 1 in an amount of 0.30g m² in terms of the silver content thereof , and 0.70 g m² of the magenta couplers RM 3 dissolved in 0.30g m² of dioctyl phthalate. Layer 4 ... An interlayer comprising 1.2g m² of gelatin. Layer 5 ... A red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing 1.4g m² of gelatin, a red sensitive silver halide gelatin emulsion of which the silver halide composition and the average grain size are shown in Table 1 in an amount of 0.26g m² in terms of the silver content thereof , and 0.50g m² of the cyan couplers RC 1 and RC 2 at a mol of 2 1 dissolved in 0.20g m² of dioctyl phthalate. Layer 6 ... A protective layer containing 0.50g m² of gelatin. In addition, the above blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer were spectrally sensitized by appropriate sensitizing dyes which are generally used. In addition, sodium 2,4 dichloro 6 hydroxy S triazine as a hardening agent was added to Layers 2, 4 and 6 in a quantity of 0.025g per gram of gelatin in the respective layers, and after that, the resulting light sensitive material was tested in the same manner as in Example 1, with respect to the layer swelling rate T 1 2, using the following color developer solution, and as a result, the value of T 1 2 was 12 seconds. Each of the light sensitive material samples No.201 through No.225 given in Table 1 was exposed through an optical wedge to light, and then processed in the same procedure as in Example 1 The processed samples each was subjected to sensitometry test in usual manner. The density of the exposure range in the proximity of the density 1.0 of each sample when the concentration of potassium bromide is 0.6g liter was regarded as 100, and changes in the density when the concentration of potassium bromide was thus changed are shown in relative values to the 100 in Table 10. In addition, the processed color densities comparative data measured by the spectral reflectance densitometer PDA 65 mfd. by Konishiroku Photo Ind. Co., Ltd. are given with respect to the cyan densities alone in Table 10. As is apparent from the results shown in Table 10, Samples No.13 through No.25 whose silver halide is substantial silver chlorobromide and whose emulsion contains Exemplified Compound 1 or 2 as the color developing agent of this invention show little changes in the formed color density and therefore show high processing stability even when the bromide ion concentration in the color developer solution is changed from 0.6g liter to 1.5g liter and 3.5g liter as compared to Samples No.201 through No.212 whose silver halide is not substantial silver chlorobromide. In contrast, where Conventional Color Developing Agent CD 3 or CD 6 was used, there is the disadvantage that every processed sample, regardless of the silver halide composition, shows the formed color density deteriorated according to the increase in the bromide ion concentration in the color developer solution. In addition, Table 1 shows that, in this invention, the replenishing quantity can be significantly reduced, since it shows that the processing took place with a less replenishing quantity with the increase in the bromide ion concentration. Silver halide photographic light sensitive material Sample No.221 was used and processed using the same processing solutions and exposed in the same manner as in Example 10 except that color developer solutions prepared with the color developing agent varied as shown in Table 11 were used, and the color developing took place at 38 C for periods varied as shown in Table 11. The processed samples each was aged under the illumination of a xenon lamp light and changes in the cyan density were measured. That is, where the initial density 1.0 of each sample processed for each developing period in the developer containing Developing Agent CD 3 is reduced by about 0.3, the density deterioration of the same density region of the same sample processed in the other color developer containing the other Developing Agent was measured and are shown in Table 11. At that time, the same sample s unexposed portion s yellow stain was measured and is also shown in Table 11. As is apparent from the results in Table 11, where the color developer solution contains Color Developing Agent CD 3 or CD 6, no large difference in the discoloration rate between the agents is recognized whatever the color developing time seconds may be, but CD 6 is larger in the discoloration than CD 3. The same thing is true to the yellow stain density Dmin in the unexposed area. On the other hand, as for the color developing agent, Exemplified Compound 1 or 2 of the present invention, where the color developing time exceeds 180 seconds, the discoloration increases and the preservability in aging becomes significantly deteriorated. The same thing is true also to the yellow stain density Dmin in the unexposed area. However, where the color developing time is less than 150 seconds, the preservability in aging is drastically improved to give more favorable results than in the case where the above CD 3 is used. This fact is surprising beyond the saying that the structure of the formed dye has close relations with the stability of the dye. The remaining of the color developing agent in the layer is assumed to also largely relate to the fact. The respective silver halides of Samples No.203 and No.221 were used to prepare samples each having blue , green and red sensitive emulsion layers coated so that the silver halide coating quantities are the same as those used in Example 1, and containing variously varied quantities of a hardening agent. These samples, after being dried, were immersed in the foregoing color developer solution at a measured temperature of 30 C and measure with respect to the layer swelling rate T 1 2 in the same manner as in Example 1. From these samples those having swelling rates T 1 2 of 2 seconds, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 60 seconds, 90 seconds and 120 seconds were selected and used. These selected samples each was exposed in the same manner as in Example 1 and processed in the same processing solutions as those used in Example 1. The maximum cyan density obtained when each sample was color developed for 10 minutes at 38 C was regarded as 100, and the processing period of time required for the maximum density of each sample to be 80 is given in Table 12. The results represent the rapidness of the development completing point of time. As is apparent from the results in Table 12, where the silver halide is silver chloride, if the color developing agent used is of this invention and the layer swelling rate T 1 2 is less than 30 seconds, the development completing time time up to reaching the Dmax of 80 is very short, so that rapid processing is possible. On the other hand, even though the color developing agent of this invention is used, if the layer swelling rate T 1 2 exceeds 40 seconds, the development completing reaching time becomes drastically longer, while on the other hand, in the case of the non invention color developing agents, even if the layer swelling rate T 1 2 is very small, no rapid development completing reaching time are obtained. Meanwhile, where the silver halide is substantial silver iodobromide, even thought the color developing agent used is of this invention, no rapid development completing reaching time can be obtained regardless of whether the layer swelling rate T 1 2 is longer or shorter. The silver halide photographic light sensitive material samples No.203 and No.221 of Example 1 were used to prepare samples each having blue , green and red sensitive emulsion layers by coating so that each layer has the same quantity of silver and the total coating amounts of silver of the respective samples are 0.4g m², 0.75g m², 1.0g m², 2g m², 3g m², 5g m² and 7g m². The layer swelling rate T 1 2 measured at a processing temperature of 30 C of each sample was 12 seconds. The quantities of the couplers used in Example 1 were applied intact to the sample containing the total amounts of silver of 1.0g m², and to the other samples were used the couplers in quantities relative to the respective total amounts of silver thereof. As for processing solutions, the same ones were used with the exception of the color developing agent varied in the same way as in Examples 10, 11 and 12. Regarding the bromide ion concentration, 1.5g liter of potassium bromide were used. The maximum density obtained when each sample is processed in each color developer solution at 38 C for 10 minutes is regarded as 100, and a processing period of time required for the maximum density to be 80 was measured, and the results, the obtained development completing time time up to reaching the Dmax of 80 , are shown in Table 13 in the same way as in Example 12. As is apparent from Table 13, it is understood that, even in the processing method of this invention, as the total amounts of silver largely increases, the development completing time tends to become drastically longer, but the development completing time in this invention is still much shorter than that of the comparative processing. The Sample No.221 of the color light sensitive materials used in the Example 1 was used herein with the exception that the yellow couplers were replaced by those shown in Table 14. Wherein, the amounts of the same hardener as was used in the Example 2 were variously changed to be added, and the layer swelling rates T 1 2 at a temperature of 30 C, for measurements and treatments were selected to be 2 sec., 5 sec., 10 sec., 15 sec., 30 sec., 40 sec., 60 sec., 90 sec. and 120 sec., respectively, so that the samples were prepared to be used for the experiments. The resulted samples were exposed through an interference filter KL 46 and an optical wedge and then treated with the same processing liquids as those used in the Example 1, provided that the Exemplified Compound 1 was used as the color developing agent in the treatments. Each of the treated samples was measured on the green and blue density at the maximum color density by making use of a spectral reflectance densitometer, Model PDA 65 manufactured by Konishiroku Photo Ind. Co., Ltd., Japan . The results thereof are shown in Table 5. As is obvious from the results shown in Table 14, when using the other yellow couplers than those of the invention, which have a relative coupling reaction rate of less than 0.3, the green density thereof are increased and, the layer swelling rates thereof T 1 2 are remarkably increased particularly when it is not faster than 30 seconds. These facts indicate that some magenta dyes are apt to produce as the yellow couplers are produced and, that is, a color turbidity is caused. On the other hand, when using the Exemplified Compounds Y 4 , Y 6 and Y 22 of the invention each having a relative coupling reaction rate of not slower than 0.3, it indicates the facts that the green density thereof are much lower and the color turbidity thereof are apparently less, than those of the comparative examples, and, in addition to the above, such an excellent result can be enjoyed as that a color turbidity can be lessed without much depending upon a layer swelling rate T 1 2.
