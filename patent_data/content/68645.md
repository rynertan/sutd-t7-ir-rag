## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory, and more particularly to a semiconductor memory device which has a high packaging density and which is advantageous for attaining a fast operation as well as a high S N signal to noise ratio. In semiconductor memory devices, as the packaging density is increased in order to increase its storage capacity, the capacity of a charge storage portion in each memory cell decreases. In addition, the area of the memory array on a memory chip increases, and the capacitance of a data line, and the length thereof, both increase. Accordingly, it becomes increasingly difficult to attain the features of both fast operation and high S N ratio. In order to obtain a large capacity memory of fast operation and high S N ratio, various arrangements have been proposed. An example will be described in connection with a MOS dynamic memory which is constructed of memory cells each including one transistor and one capacitor. In the example shown in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings, two memory arrays MA1 and MA2 are arranged on both the sides of a Y decoder Y DEC and have sense amplifiers SA arranged on the outer sides thereof. When a memory cell MC connected to a data line D A semiconductor memory is disclosed in United States Specification No. 4,056,811. It specifically relates to random access memories. The memory cells in a row are divided into sub rows and an access transistor is used to selectively isolate or connect the output terminals of each sub row of the memory cells to the row line. The capacitive loading of the output signal from the memory cells is reduced when the data stored therein is recalled. Each row of memory cells is divided into contiguous sub rows, and a sub row data conductor is associated with each sub row of memory cells. Memory cells in the same column are connected to a common word line. Access devices are provided, each of which is connected to the corresponding sub row conductor, so that all access devices in the same row can be controlled by a single line. The access devices in the same row connect the sublines to a common row conductor. Thus, when the data stored in a memory cell has to be recalled, which cell is in a particular sub row, the access devices belonging to the other sub row remain turned off, so that only the output terminals of the memory cells in said particular sub row are connected to the common row line. For a memory array of a given size, the advantage of dividing each row of memory cells into sub rows rather than decreasing the number of memory cells per row and increasing the number of rows in the array, is that the former requires less semiconductor surfaces area per stored bit than does the latter. Because each row line requires a separate sense amplifier, and row line decoder, while each column line requires only a column line decoder, a configuration which has a decreased number of memory cells per row and an increased number of rows would require more area for the support circuitry. Another semiconductor memory device is disclosed in US A 436559 and DE A 2919166. The memory device comprises a plurality of pairs of digit lines, a plurality of sense amplifiers, each having a pair of input terminals, a plurality of pairs of gating means and a plurality of memory cells. In this construction, respective pairs of input terminals of the sense amplifier are operatively coupled through respective pairs of gating means to respective pairs of digit lines, whereby a load chapcitance of a digit line is reduced in order to increase the detection sensitivity and thus provide high speed operation. The present invention seeks to provide a semiconductor memory having large storage capacity without a substantial increase in the area needed for the peripheral circuits, and which is capable of fast writing and fast reading and which exhibits a high S N ratio and a high reliability. According to the present invention there is provided a memory device including In accordance with such constructions, the sub lines onto which the data of the memory cells are once read out can have their capacitances reduced owing to the division in the lengthwise direction, so that a reading operation of high speed and high gain is permitted. In addition, even when the number of divisions is increased one decoder for addressing in the digit direction Y decoder suffices, so that substantially no increase in the area occupied by the peripheral circuits results. In accordance with this construction, either the control lines or the common input output lines need to be laid in the same direction as that of the divided data lines and across the memory array. However, since such wiring can be provided in a multi level fashion by forming it as a layer different from that of the data lines sub lines , the area occupied by the memory array is not substantially increased. The present invention will now be described in greater detail by way of example with reference to the remaining figures of the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 2 conceptually shows a structure which is common to several embodiments of the present invention. In a memory wherein word lines W and data lines D With such a construction, the data lines are divided, so that a read out signal of high output voltage is obtained from the memory cell MC to the data line D₀₀ at high speed by a word selection voltage which is delivered to the selected word line W from a circuit block 10 including an X decoder and a word driver. Moreover, with this construction, no substantial increase in the chip area resulting from the division occurs. The reason is that the circuit block 20 does not have to be duplicated for each divided memory array, so that it is sufficient to provide only one circuit block 20 common to the sub data lines. In the construction shown in Figure 2, when lines YC are formed by a manufacturing step different from that of the lines D Figure 3 shows a preferred form of memory array as applied to a semiconductor memory having a folded data line arrangement. A data line forming each row is divided into, e.g. D Word lines only one word line W All outputs from the sense amplifiers arrayed in the first column are associated with a common input output line I O 0 . Among these sense amplifiers, only one selected by the circuit block 20 through any of the control lines YC₀, YC₃, YC₄, YC₇ etc. has its output applied to the common input output line I O 0 and then transmitted to a read write controller 30. Likewise, the outputs of the sense amplifiers arrayed in the other columns are transmitted to selected common input output lines I O 1 etc. The read write controller 30 is controlled by an address signal A and a write read control signal WE, and provides a data output D Referring now to Figures 4A, 4B and 4C as seen from the equivalent circuit diagram of Figure 4B, the plan view of Figure 4A shows only the portion of two memory cells which are respectively connected to the paired data lines D₀ and As shown in Figure 4A, the control line YC which is laid between the pair of data lines D₀ and Figure 5 shows the sense amplifier SA in greater detail and the proximate circuits which have been omitted from Figure 3. The data lines D₀ and The operation of the above embodiment will be described in greater detail with reference to the waveforms shown in Figure 6. First, all of the nodes D₀, Important features of the above described circuit arrangement are Of course, these circuits can be arranged for the respective memory arrays MA and MA as in the prior art without being made common. In Figure 6, the supply voltage V That portion in the circuit block 20 which produces the control signal Ø When the Y decoder Y DEC precharged to the supply voltage V Referring now to Figure 9, the chip is in the shape of an elongated rectangle so that it may be readily received in a standard DIP Dual In Line Package . The direction of the divided data lines D₀₀, D₀₀ etc. agrees with the lengthwise direction of the chip. The circuit block 10 including the X decoder is arranged centrally of the chip, and on both the sides thereof, the memory arrays MA₀, MA₀ , MA₁, MA₁ etc. divided by the division of the data lines are arranged in alignment. The circuit blocks 20 including the Y decoders are each arranged on one side of the alignment of the memory arrays. The control circuits 31 and 32 are arranged in the remaining parts. The control lines YC are laid from the circuit blocks 20 including the Y decoders, so as to extend across the memory cells. In the case where the spacing between the adjacent control lines has room as in embodiments to be described later, different wiring lines from the control circuits 31 and 32 can be formed of the same layer as that of the control lines YC as illustrated in Figure 10. Referring now to a modified embodiment shown in Figure 11, it should be noted from what has been said previously that the control line YC is preferably arranged in the middle of the data lines D₀ and As shown in Figure 11, therefore, the control lines YC are formed so as to intersect over the middle parts of the divided data lines D₀ etc. According to such a construction, even when the mask misregistration has occurred in the manufacturing steps, both the data lines D₀ and It is possible to realize various other structures in which even in the presence of the mask misregistration, no difference occurs between the capacitances of the paired data lines as described above. Figure 12 shows an example in which the data line D₀ and In any of the foregoing embodiments, one control line is arranged in correspondence with the paired data lines. In order to reduce the number of control lines, a construction in which one control line is arranged for two pairs of data lines is also realisable. Figure 13 shows the general circuit arrangement of such an embodiment, whilst Figure 14 shows an embodiment in the case where the switching circuits GC and GC as shown in Figure 3 are jointly used. Figure 15 shows an embodiment in which the portion of the switching circuit SW in the embodiment shown in Figure 5 is modified. The modified switching circuit SW is controlled by the control line YC and a control line IOC extending from the X decoder 10. Since only the switching circuit SW existing at the intersection point of the selected lines X and Y turns on , outputs can be selectively delivered to the lines I O O , I O 1 etc. in Figure 3. This signifies that the lines I O O , I O 1 etc. can be decoded in advance. Therefore, a simplified circuit can be adopted for the read write controller 30. Figure 16 shows an example in which, by expanding the idea of the embodiment shown in Figure 15, the control line YC is arranged in correspondence with two pairs of data lines, not each pair of data lines. Thus, the number of wired control lines YC becomes half, that is, the wiring pitch is twice as great as the previous embodiments, so that the manufacture is facilitated. In operation, the switching circuit SW₀ or SW₁ turns on only when the signal from the control line IOC O or IOC 1 and the signal from the control line YC have coincided. However the embodiment shown in Figure 16, differs from the embodiment shown in Figure 15 in that the signal of the control line IOC O or IOC 1 includes an information of a Y system address signal besides that of an X system address signal. That is, when the pair of the data lines D₀ and Whilst the control line YC is arranged in correspondence with the two pairs of data lines, it is needless to say that each control line YC can be arranged in correspondence with any desired number of pairs of data lines. Figure 17 shows another embodiment in which the wiring pitch of the lines YC is enlarged, for example, twice as great as in the case of Figure 16. Two sets of I O lines are provided, and the lines I O O and With the present embodiment, as in the embodiment of Figure 16, the wiring pitch of the control lines YC can be enlarged thus facilitating the manufacture. Whilst the embodiments thus far described are based on the structure of Figure 3, it is obvious that the X and Y decoders can be arranged in proximity as shown in Figure 18. In the embodiment shown in Figure 5, the Y decoder 20 is replaced with an X and Y decoder 20 . The X and Y decoder 20 carries out the operation A of an X decoder and the operation B of a Y decoder in divided time zones. The coincidence between a pulse Ø In Figure 18, the circuit block 10 shown in the right hand part of the drawing does not include the function of the Y decoder. This is based on the assumption that the number of decoders required for driving the control lines YC is within the number of decoders located in the left hand part of the drawing, and the same function as that of the left decoders is sometimes given to the right decoders 10. In the case where the juxtaposition of the gate circuits WD and YD is difficult in relation to the occupying area, the gate circuit YD can be designed in a manner to be distributed among a plurality of decoder portions. Whereas the above described embodiments are directed to the memory of the folded data line arrangement, an embodiment shown in Figure 20 is directed to a memory of the open data line arrangement. Also in this embodiment each data line is divided into a plurality of sub lines in the lengthwise direction. This arrangement is different from the embodiment shown in Figure 3 in that the paired data lines D₀ and Figure 21 shows an embodiment which is applied to a MOS static memory. When compared with the embodiments of the MOS dynamic memory shown in detail in Figure 5, the embodiment of Figure 21 differs in the structure of the memory cell MC and also differs in that the auxiliary circuits such as the sense amplifiers are not required for the respective pairs of data lines. The paired data lines D Figure 22 shows the construction of an embodiment in which the sense of the common input output line common to a plurality of divided data lines is different from that shown in the previous embodiments. That is, the common input output line I O O which is common to the divided data lines D₀₀, D₀₁, D₀₂ and D₀₃ is arranged in parallel with these data lines. Figure 23 illustrates an embodiment to which the structure of Figure 22 is applied. A sense amplifier SA₁ of a first stage is connected to the paired divided data lines D₀₀ and Paired common input output lines I O O and Also in this embodiment, the information of the memory cell MC is once read out onto the divided data line, and it is amplified by the sense amplifier of the first stage and then delivered to the common input output line. Therefore, even when the charge storage capacity of the memory cell is small, the information can be read out with a sufficient margin. Since the selective drive of the control lines YC₀, YC₁, YC₂ and YC₃ serves to effect the selection in the word direction, it may well be performed by the circuit block 10 including the X decoder. Figure 24 shows another embodiment to which the construction of Figure 22 is applied. The difference between the embodiment shown in this Figure from the embodiment shown in Figure 23 is that the paired common input output lines I O O and
