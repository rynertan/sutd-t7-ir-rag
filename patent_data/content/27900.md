# Improved decoding method and system for ETAB bar code.

## Abstract
A high density bar code 1 scanned to be read out provides a time varying analog electric signal 3 which after being reshaped is decoded 5 , i.e., converted into a binary bit representation, based on distances measured between consecutive leading and consecutive trailing edges of the reshaped analog signal. Decoding errors due to mis measurements of said distance is minimized by using a decoding process based on comparison of each measured distance to a first or to a second preset threshold level. The choice of the threshold to be used for decoding a given bit depends on the odd or even characteristic of the number of bits 1 previously decoded on the same bit stream. In addition, at least one of the thresholds is dynamically re adjusted throughout the process, based on the last mea sured distance.
