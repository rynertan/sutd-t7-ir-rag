# Adhesive system for production of spiral wound membrane elements for use in organic fluid mixture separations.

## Abstract
In fabricating a reverse osmosis spiral wound apparatus for the separation of organic fluid mixtures, especially for the separation of dewaxing solvents containing ketone from dewaxed oil by permeation through a permeable membrane such as pretreated regenerated cellulose or asymmetric polyimide, a special epoxy adhesive formulation is used to form the membrane element edge seals which serve to define separate permeate zones and feed stream zones. This special adhesive formulation has a relatively long pot life, i.e. will not set too quickly permitting it to be easily handled during appli cation to the membrane edges in the course of element fabri cation, as well as being flexible trimmable and of proper viscosity, and comprises the following components 1 a reaction product of bisphenol A and epichlorohydrin 2 a thickening agent 3 a low temperature, low exotherm polyamide or amidoamine curing agent 4 a diluent and optionally 5 , a high molecular weight polyurethane flexibil izer. The relative proportions by weight of components 1 2 3 4 and 5 are in the range 100 0 to 15 40 to 70 8 to 32 2 to 8.
