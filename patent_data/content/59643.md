# Dual spool pre tensioner.

## Abstract
A dual spool pre tensioner 12 acts upon a dual spool retractor 13 by projecting a piston element 29 between extensions of the adjacent shafts 17 of the retractor. The shaft extensions 23 are upset as by knurling. and a portion 38, 39 of the piston element is in an interference oath with the upset portion of the shafts. The piston is cartridge driven by pyrotechnic means 33 and the portion of the piston means which contacts the shafts is deformed during passage between the shafts so that the shafts and the reels 16 attached thereto are positively rotated and webbing 18 on such wheels is wound thereon. The pretensioner is remov ably attached by its case 12a to the retractor frame 13a and stresses in the pre tensioner are thereby transmitted through the retractor frame to the mounting thereof.
