# MULTI MASTER COMMUNICATION BUS SYSTEM WITH PARALLEL BUS REQUEST ARBITRATION

## Abstract
Apparatus and a related method for regulating access to a communication bus to which multiple communication nodes are connected. Control logic at each of the nodes determines which of them has priority to access the bus, by means of a parallel arbitration sequence in which all nodes contending for bus access participate. Specifically, each contending node generates a relative priority node number and asserts it onto an arbitration bus. All of the asserted node numbers are logically combined into a composite node number on the bus, and the winning node is determined in a bit by bit ripple comparison circuit at each node, the compo site node number being compared with the locally generated relative priority node number. Priority is determined in advance of data transmission, and synchronization and arbitration take place without any central or master control unit.
