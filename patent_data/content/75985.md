# A data processing device for processing multiple symbol data words based on a symbol correcting code and having multiple operating modes.

## Abstract
A computer system is described which is based on a symbol correcting code. The code words consist of a number of code symbols. In the normal operating mode of the error correction members, correction is possible of all errors which are either limited to one code symbol or which concern only two arbitrarily situated code bits. During operation in the erasure mode, a predetermined code symbol within the code word is not taken into account therefore, it may contain an arbitrary, unknown error. Moreover, an error can be corrected which concerns only one arbitrarily situated code bit. In the selection mode, two predetermined code symbols within the code word are not taken into account. The data words can be reconstructed from the others. The mode is controlled by the content of the mode register 110 . The mode register is controlled by the output signals 106 of syndrome generators 102 .
