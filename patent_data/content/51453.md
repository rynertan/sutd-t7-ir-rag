# Spindle orientation control apparatus.

## Abstract
A speed control circuit 3 and position control circuit 11 are connected to a spindle drive motor 4 in a machine tool or the like in order to drive the spindle 7 at a predetermined speed and stop the spindle 7 at a predeter mined angular position. When an orientation command is issued while the spindle 7 is being rotated at the predeter mined speed by a speed control loop, a speed command signal from a speed command circuit 1 is interrupted, the speed reduced to zero, and an initially set voltage is then employed as a speed command to rotate the spindle 7 by a predetermined amount. Next, an integral value of the actual spindle speed is employed as the speed command to further rotate the spindle 7 by a predetermined amount. When this has been accomplished, a constant bias voltage of a low level replaces the speed command, thereby to rotate the spindle 7 still further by a predetermined amount until a specified portion of the spindle approaches extremely close to the predetermined angular position. At this point a signal, sensed by a magnetic body provided on the specified portion of the spindle and a sensing circuit confronting the magnetic body 10 , is employed as the speed command signal of the speed control circuit 3 , the sensed signal having a gradually decreasing waveform which attains a value of zero when the specified portion of the spindle 7 is stopped at the predetermined angular position. Using this signal gradually decelerates the spindle motor to stop the spindle accurately at the desired angular position.
