# An apparatus for comparing the distance of two balls from a third ball.

## Abstract
An apparatus for comparing the distances of two balls from a third ball which all lie on a horizontal plane comprises a telescopic rod 20 pivotally mounted to swing around the vertical axis of a stand 3 which rests on the same plane as the balls. At the free end of the telescopic rod 20 a vertical strip 45 is attached which is brought to successively contact said two balls for comparing their distances from the third ball. The telescopic rod stand 3 is provided with means 48, 50, 52 for centering it vertically over the third ball. A dolly 28 is inserted between the end of the telescopic rod 20 and said vertical strip 45 for supporting the rod, which dolly can be moved along a circle centered on the axis of said stand said dolly 28 being provided with a rack and pinion device 42,46 for micrometrically approaching said strip to a ball.
