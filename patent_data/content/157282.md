## Description
This invention relates to an electric power supply circuit for use in a digital carrier transmission system of a distant power feeding type to supply a load with a constant current and to a constant current unit for use in the electric power supply circuit. A conventional electric power supply circuit of the type described comprises a plurality of constant current units connected in series to a load, such as a repeater amplifier and the like, included in a current path and has therefore a redundant structure in order to compensate for a failure of each constant current unit. In addition, it is a recent trend that the repeater amplifier has a wide variety of functions. Under the circumstances, the electric power supply circuit should produce an output current which amounts to 500 mA 2A. A maximum output voltage must reach 15 kV. Accordingly, each of the constant current units should have a high power and a high efficiency on DC DC power conversion. For this purpose, a constant current converter of a resonant type has been developed as each of the constant current units in order to accomplish an efficiency which is not lower than 90 . As will later be described with reference to a few figures of the accompanying drawing, the constant current converter comprises an inverter circuit which is controllable by a local signal of a controllable frequency and which converts a d.c. input signal into an a.c. output signal. The a.c. output signal is sent through a resonant circuit to a rectifying and smoothing circuit to be converted into a resultant d.c. current. The resultant d.c. current is delivered to the load and is monitored by a current detector. A detection signal is supplied from the current detector through a control circuit to a voltage to frequency converter as a control voltage signal. The voltage to frequency converter supplies the inverter circuit with the local signal of the frequency controlled by the control voltage signal. With this structure, the resultant d.c. current can be kept substantially constant, as is well known in the art. When a plurality of constant current converters are connected in series to the load, a resistor should be connected in parallel to each constant current converter so as to stably divide the load to the respective constant current converters. Otherwise, overload occurs in one or more of the constant current converters when the resultant d.c. current varies within a range determined for each of the constant current converters. However, connection of the resistors to the converters results in degradation of a constant current characteristic and in a loss of electric power due to currents which flow through the respective resistors. Heat is inevitably produced in the resistors and requires a countermeasure. As a result, each of the converters becomes bulky. In addition, the control circuit and the current detector should be installed in each of the converters, which makes the electric power supply circuit expensive. Furthermore, it takes a long time to adjust the whole current of the electric power supply circuit to a desired constant value. A paper is contributed by Jun Chida et al to National Convention Record in English translation of the Institute of Electronics and Communication Engineers of Japan, published March 5, 1984, pages 10 30, under the title of Control Circuit for Series Resonant Constant Current Converter in English translation . In the Chida et al paper, an electric power supply circuit is disclosed which comprises a plurality of constant current converters connected in series to a load without any resistors so as to avoid the above enumerated defects resulting from connection of the resistors. To this end, a set of current detectors is coupled to a set of control circuits outside of the converters to produce a control current signal common to the respective constant current converters. The control current signal is individually converted into control voltages of current to voltage converters installed in the respective constant current converters, respectively. The control voltages are further converted into local signals of frequencies controlled by the control voltages in the manner described before. With this structure, each converter should have the current to voltage converter and therefore becomes intricate in structure. From Patent Abstracts of Japan, Volume 6, 262 P 164 1140 December 21, 1982, a DC constant current device is known. In this device, a plurality of DC constant current sources are combined in series and provide a current to a common load. In this device current detectors are connected in series to a common part of said DC constant current sources in the same number as these current sources. The output of each detector is provided to a respective constant current source in order to control its performance. The It is an object of this invention to provide an electric power supply circuit having a reduced loss of electric power therein and being very simple in structure. This object is achieved by the features of independent claim 1. The subclaims are directed to preferred embodiments of the invention. Referring to Fig. 1, description will be made as regards a conventional electric power supply circuit at first in order to facilitate an understanding of the present invention. The electric power supply circuit comprises a plurality of constant current converters which are Each of the constant current converters 11 suffixes omitted is supplied with a d.c. input signal from a main power source 14 and comprises an inverter circuit 16 for converting the d.c. input signal into an a.c. output signal in accordance with a local signal LS of a controllable frequency f The rectifying and smoothing circuit 19 produces d.c. electric power of a resultant d.c. current I Responsive to the difference voltage V Temporarily referring to Fig. 2, the rectifying and smoothing circuit 19 produces the resultant d.c. voltage V With a reduction of the frequency ratio δ, the output impedance of the rectifying and smoothing circuit 19 becomes high. As shown in Fig. 2, saturation occurs when the resultant d.c. current I Under the circumstances, the frequency ratio δ is controlled in each constant current converter 11 so that the resultant d.c. current I Turning back to Fig. 1, the plurality of constant current converters 11 shares the load 12 with a predetermined distribution. The series connection of the plurality of constant current converters 11 results in a variation of the predetermined distribution when the resultant d.c. current fluctuates within a range accepted in each constant current converter in a part of the constant current converters 11. Overload partially takes place in the constant current converters. In order to avoid the overload, a resistor 30 is connected in parallel to each converter 11, as illustrated in Fig. 1 and may be called a shunt resistor. When the resistor 30 has a resistance of R The series connection of the converters 11 gives a circuit output impedance equal to n R Referring to Fig. 3 together with Fig. 1, a curve 31 exemplifies the current versus voltage characteristic of the electric power supply circuit illustrated in Fig. 1. As readily understood from the curve 31, the circuit output current L From Equation 1 , it is readily understood that degradation of a constant current characteristic results from connection of the resistors 30. In addition, an electric current for the decrement ΔI flows through the resistors 30 and brings about a loss W Accordingly, the illustrated electric power supply circuit has various disadvantages as pointed out in the preamble of the instant specification. Furthermore, each resultant d.c. current I In Fig. 1, a diode D is connected in parallel to each of the resistors 30. Each diode D serves to bypass the circuit output I Referring to Fig. 4, an electric power supply circuit according to a first embodiment of this invention comprises similar parts and signals designated by like reference numerals and symbols. The illustrated electric power supply circuit comprises a plurality of constant current units which are somewhat different from the constant current converters 11₁ to 11 Anyway, the illustrated electric power supply circuit produces the circuit output current I In Fig. 4, a single current detector 37 is coupled outside of each constant current unit 35 to the current path to detect the circuit output current I The detection signal is delivered from the current detector 37 to a single or common control circuit 39 comprising a comparator 41 and a current output circuit 42. The comparator 41 compares the detection voltage with a reference voltage V The current output circuit 42 comprises a transistor TR and first and second resistors R₁ and R₂ connected to the base and the emitter of the transistor TR, respectively. The emitter is grounded through the second resistor R₂. The result signal is given to the base through the first resistor R₁ and converted into a control current I The control current I At any rate, the control current I Specifically, the frequency ratio of each unit 35 is controlled in common by the control voltage V On the other hand, each constant current unit 35 has an output characteristic similar to that illustrated in Fig. 2 and therefore exhibits a unit output impedance equal to a certain finite value. Each unit output impedance serves to determine a share of the load, namely, each partial load for each constant current unit 35, like the shunt resistors 30 illustrated in Fig. 1. Thus, the load is stably shared by the respective constant current units 35. Each unit output impedance is varied in dependence upon the frequency ratio δ. However, it is possible to make the frequency ratio δ of each unit 35 equal to one another by selecting the constant current units 35. More specifically, if a resonant frequency of each resonant circuit 17 and a conversion ratio of each voltage to frequency converter 27 are equal to one another, the constant current units 35 have the same frequency ratios. Under the circumstances, the load 12 is equally shared by the constant current units 35 without use of any resistors. The resultant voltage V Thus, the above mentioned circuit is advantageous in that conversion efficiency is improved because no shunt resistor results in a reduction of power consumption. In addition, no countermeasure is necessary for heat produced from the shunt resistors 30. The circuit therefore becomes compact. Inasmuch as the output impedance of the circuit is extremely high, it is possible to accurately accomplish a constant current characteristic. Inasmuch as a single control circuit 39 and a single current to voltage converter 44 control the plurality of the constant current units 35 in common, the illustrated circuit is constructed by a small number of parts and is therefore simple in structure and inexpensive. Furthermore, the circuit output current I Like in Fig. 1, the circuit is normally operable even when the constant current units 35 may individually be separated from the circuit. This is because the circuit output current I Referring to Fig. 5, an electric power supply circuit according to a second embodiment of this invention comprises similar parts and signals designated by like reference numerals and symbols. The illustrated control circuit 39 comprises an additional power source 47 which has a negative terminal connected to the collector of the transistor TR and a positive terminal connected to the current to voltage converter 44. Thus, the additional power source 47 is connected in series to the collector of the transistor TR and isolated from the ground. The control current I It is assumed that each of the voltage to frequency converters has an input impedance R The control voltage V Although not shown in Fig. 5, the comparator comprises an oscillator, such as a Loyer oscillator, a Jensen oscillator, or the like, in an electric power source circuit thereof. The additional power source 46 may be formed by a combination of a winding connected to the oscillator and a rectifying and smoothing circuit. The above mentioned electric power source circuit is simple in structure as compared with that illustrated in Fig. 4 and is similar in operation and merit to the latter. Therefore, the circuit illustrated in Fig. 5 is economical in comparison with the circuit illustrated in Fig. 4. Referring to Fig. 6, an electric power supply circuit according to a third embodiment of this invention is similar to that illustrated in Fig. 5 except that first through m th current detectors 37₁ to 31 Thus, each of the difference voltages which are given from the comparators 41 is converted into the partial control currents to be combined into the control current I Operation can be carried out in the electric power supply circuit illustrated in Fig. 6 in a manner similar to those illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5. Even when a trouble occurs in one of the first through m th control circuits 39₁ to 39 The current to voltage converter 44 and each of the control circuits 39₁ to 39 Referring to Fig. 7, a constant current unit 51 according to a fourth embodiment of this invention is used instead of that combination of the shunt resistor 30 and each of the constant current converters 11₁ through 11 The constant current source 53 provides a source current in response to the local signal LS given from a control unit 55 which is an assemblage of the control circuit 23 and the voltage to frequency converter 27 both of which illustrated in Fig. 1. The source current is similar to the resultant d.c. current I The illustrated constant current unit 51 comprises a current detector 57 supplied with the source current I The shunt resistor 30 serves to partially shunt the source current I With this structure, the source current I Under the circumstances, the detection voltage V On the other hand, the reference voltage V The additional current I When the voltage V Referring to Fig. 8, operation characteristics are illustrated which are specified by Equations 5 , 6 , and 8 and wherein first and second ones of the constant current units 51 illustrated in Fig. 7 are connected in series to each other in the manner illustrated in Fig. 1 to form an electric power supply circuit. In this event, the first and the second constant current units produce first and second unit output voltages depicted at V In Fig. 8, curves 71 and 72 show the operation characteristics of the first and the second constant current units, respectively. Each unit current is gradually reduced from each maximum value I₁₀ and I₂₀ with an increase of each of the unit output voltages V As long as no parallel displacement takes place, a load current I₁₀ flows through both of the first and the second constant current units as indicated at an intermediate point P₀. At this time, the first unit output voltage V As readily understood from Fig. 8, a sum of the first and the second unit output voltages V In Fig. 8, the transition voltage V Under the circumstances, it is proved that the operation characteristics specified by the curves 71 and 72 can be accomplished by selecting the resistances R As are apparent from Equations 6 and 8 , absolute values of the gradients of the curve 71 are equal to 1 R and 1 R As a result, a loss of electric power can be reduced by selecting the resistances R The transition voltage V Each of the conventional converters 11 illustrated in Fig. 1 has a characteristic followed by a broken line a₀. A crosspoint between the broken line a₀ and the line 73 is placed at a conventional point q₀ and present on the lefthand side of the crosspoint Q₀. The crosspoint Q₀ is therefore nearer to a normal operation point than the conventional point q₀. This means that a current variation of each of the first and the second output currents I Thus, it is possible to decrease the loss of electric power even on connection of the shunt resistor 30 by attaching the subsidiary winding 62 to the primary winding and by carrying out current control such that the ampere turns in the primary and the subsidiary windings 61 and 62 coincide with predetermined values. It is also possible to reduce the current variation when either one of the constant current units is in trouble by causing the shunt current I Referring to Fig. 9, a constant current unit 51 according to a fifth embodiment of this invention is similar to that illustrated in Fig. 7 except that the current restriction circuit 64 is grounded instead of the resistor 30. The illustrated current restriction circuit 64 supplies the subsidiary winding not shown in this figure of the current detector 57 with a low voltage as compared with the current restriction circuit 64 Fig. 7 . The subsidiary winding of the illustrated current detector 57 is not supplied with a high voltage and may not be resistant against high voltage. This means that no countermeasure is necessary against high voltage. Accordingly, the current detector 57 becomes economical. Referring to Fig. 10, an electric power supply circuit according to a sixth embodiment of this invention is similar to that illustrated in Fig. 9 except that a reference winding 75 of a winding number N In the example being illustrated, a reference current I The illustrated control unit 55 is supplied with the reference voltage V From Equations 4 and 10 , it is readily understood that Equation 10 substitutes N Similar operation is possible by causing the shunt current I Referring to Fig. 11, a constant current unit according to a seventh embodiment of this invention is similar to that illustrated in Fig. 7 except that the current detector 64 Fig. 11 detects the circuit output current I When the voltage V and R R When V As is apparent from Equation 5 , the circuit output current I With this structure, it is possible to reduce a loss of electric power as compared with the conventional constant current circuit, like in the unit illustrated in Fig. 7. Referring to Fig. 12, a constant current unit according to an eighth embodiment is similar to that illusrated in Fig. 11 except that the current restriction circuit 64 is grounded instead of the resistor 30. With this structure, the current restriction circuit 64 supplies the subsidiary winding not shown in this figure of the current detector 64 with a voltage lower than the voltage produced by the current restriction circuit 64 of Fig. 11. Therefore, the illustrated current detector 64 may be simple in structure like in Fig.9. Referring to Fig. 13, a constant current unit according to a ninth embodiment of this invention is similar to that illustrated in Fig. 11 except that a reference winding 75 is driven by an additional constant current source 76 which produces a reference current I While this invention has thus far been described in conjunction with about ten embodiments thereof, it will readily be possible for those skilled in the art to put this invention into practice in various other manners. For example, the electric power supply circuit may be applicable to an analog communication system.
