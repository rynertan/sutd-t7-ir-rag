# Flowable compositions comprising 2 chloro N isopropylacetanilide and s triazine herbicides.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a water based, flowable herbicide composition which comprises by weight a 28.0 to 35.0 2 chloro N isopropylacetanilide herbicide b 7.0 to 16.0 of an s triazine selected from the group consisting of atrazine, simazine and propazine c 2.0 to 6.0 of a hydrated amorphous silicon dioxide d 2.0 to 6.0 of a polyoxypropylene polyoxy ethylene block copolymer e 0.5 to 2.0 of a taurate surfactant f 0.5 to 2.0 of a hydrated aluminum silicate g 0.5 to 1.0 of a flocculent h 5.0 to 10.0 of an anti freeze agent i 0.5 to 2.0 of a silicon antifoaming agent and j balance being water the solid components of said composition having a particle size of no greater than 25 microns.
