## Description
MODIFICATION OF BLOOD CIRCULATORY DYNAMICS WITHIN A LIVING BODYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the modification of the interaction of living tissues and or cells with charged species in their environment, to bring about a change in blood circulatory dynamics within a living body. Ryaby, etal.,US Patent Nos. 4,105,017, 4,266,532 and 4,266,533 describe means for effecting surgically non invasive direct inductive coupling to an afflicted body region, whereby one or more induced electric voltage pulses and concomitant current signals conform to a highly specific pattern and have been found to develop therapeutically beneficial treatment of the afflicted region, as for example in the enhancement of repair of bone fractures, non unions, and the like. In general, the involved treatment head or heads have comprised one or more large coils, which have served well for the treatment of large member bones, as in leg regions. We have discovered that pulsed magnetic fields, as generated by equipment of the character indicated, can also be the means of modifying blood circulatory dynamics within the body. BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the invention to provide a method and means for predictably and selectively modifying blood circulatory dynamics within a living body. Another object is to achieve the above object in a selected local region of the body. A further object is to provide means whereby a given and largely predetermined change in blood cir . .ulation can be initiated, monitored and controlled. The invention achieves these objects by so employing an electrical coil, which may be a loop comprising bundled multiple turns, that the area bounded by the loop substantially embraces or conforms to a lateral projection of a selected local body region, in which region it is desired to locally enhance or otherwise affect blood circulatory dynamics. The area bounded by the loop is non invasively positioned adjacent the involved body part, with the loop area in general register with such lateral projection. Pulsed electrical signals, which may be but are not necessarily those as described in said Ryaby, et ala patents, are applied to excite the coil, for a length of time and in a manner to produce a specific blood circulation change.Illustratively, as will later be explained in greater detail, a 14 minute exposure to such excitation is found to produce an enhanced presence of blood in the region affected by the pulsed magnetic field of the coil, the enhanced presence being observed as at least a 2 percent increase in ultrasonic velocity in the region upon terminating the excitation, a period of about 30 minutes was required for return to the pre treatment condition of lesser ultrasonic velocity. Such observations have been confirmed by other techniques of measuring blood presence and or blood flow in the region exposed to pulsed magnetic field action, and the measurement may be used as an element of feedback for control of coil excitation. Thus far, the enhanced flow of blood in a treated region has been the result of using certain pulse criteria, and there is some indication that certain of the waveforms can cause a reduction in blood circulation.Thus, a vaso dilation or vaso constrictive action may depend on waveform and operating point . Monitoring methods, as by use of ultrasonic, thermographic or optical means, are of value in determining the operating point.DETAILED DESCRIPTION The invention will be illustratively described in detail, in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a simplified view schematically showing components in application to a body member in use of the invention Figs. 2, 3 and 4 are simplified views to show alternative means of detecting changes in blood dynamics within the body member, for use in place of the detecting components of Fig. 1 and Fig. 5 is a succession of graphs, in explanation of data pertaining to the invention. Referring initially to Fig. 1, the invention is shown in application to a portion of a human forearm 10 wherein a localized longitudinally central region is to be subjected to modification of blood circulatory dynamics, e.g., locally enhanced blood flow, as in support of local surgery and or of the post operative healing process. A pulsed magnetic field is established through the local region, by reason of two like electrical coils 11 12, positioned on opposite sides of the limb 10.Each of the coils 11 12 may be a bundle of multiple turns, suitably about 56 turns of B gauge 28 coated copper wire, initially wound to a diameter of 23 cm and then bundled and deformed to the generally oval shape shown. Each of the coils 11 12 encompasses an included area approximating the involved lateral projection of the local limb region of pulsed magnetic field exposure, and the coils are in substantial register with said projection and with each other. Coils 11 12 are interconnected in flux aiding relation, so that when excited by the output of a pulse generator 13, they establish a substantially uniform distribution of flux development in the included geometric volume defined by and between the coils. The signal generator 13 and the character of signals produced thereby have been described in said Ryaby, et al.patents, so that further description thereof is not now needed. Provision is shown in generator 13, at 14 and 15, respectively, for selective adjustment of amplitude including ON OFF control of pulse signal output, pulse shape and for selective adjustment of pulse repetitio rate. It has been generally indicated above that a relatively short application of pulsed magnetic field energy at the region localized by coils 11 12 can measurably enhance the flow to and presence of blood within the localized region and there is some indication that after a prolonged period of pulsed magnetic field action, the flow enhancement achieves a plateau, and . .that such action, if further continued, can cause a decrease of flow enhancement. A variety of means and techniques may be drawn upon to monitor the dynamics and the quantum of the resulting change. In Fig. 1, the monitored quantity is change in ultrasonic velocity, by reason of ultrasonically exciting a transducer 15 in contact with skin within the included area of one 11 of the coils, a generator 16 of pulsed ultrasonic signals being connected to transducer 15 for the purpose. Associated componentry is shown to include a receiver 17 with signal processing means whereby an indicator 18 may display ultrasonic velocity, as derived from travel time for pulses reflected from bone within limb 10. As previously indicated, at least a 2 percent increase in ultrasonic velocity is thus observable for about a 14 minute exposure to the pulsed magnetic field. Fig. 2 provides a schematic indication of the use of two ultrasonic transducers 20 21 applied to opposite sides of limb 10 again within the localized region between coils in conjunction with suitable means 22 of measuring changes in acoustic impedance. Observed changes in acoustic impedance are another indicator of changes in blood presence in the localized region, acoustic impedance changes being generally proportional to ultrasonic velocity changes. Fig. 3 provides a schematic indication of the use of two ultrasonic transducers 25 26 at longitudinally spaced locations along the same side of limb 10, whereby signal output from an ultrasonic generator 27 may be observed at 28 for changes in Doppler effect frequency shift attributable to changes in blood flow in the region of pulsed magnetic field exposure. The detecting techniques involved in the different embodiments of Figs. 1, 2 and 3 will be understood to be merely illustrative, in that other techniques including optical transmission techniques are or may become available, for noting the quantum of blood presence change or blood flow changes. And it will be understood that by having the surgeon or a technician monitor for a desired change, it can be known when to reduce the level of magnetic pul se generation, or to terminate the same, as in order to remove all obstacles for performance of a surgical operation, it being noted that, after a termination of pulsed magnetic field exposure, a period of about 30 minutes exists within which to expect enhanced blood presence in the localized region of interest. Fig. 4 illustrates that any of the described apparatus lends itself to a measure of automation, and therefore a single transducer 15 within coil 11 will be understood to schematically represent the transducer system of any of the embodiments of Figs. 1, 2 or 3. By the same token, in Fig. 4, the detection means 30 will be understood to be as appropriate to the particular selected detection technique for monitoring for change in blood presence or blood flow, and a threshold circuit 31 with means 32 to select a predetermined threshold may therefore provide an output to a suitable indicator 33 when the detected change in blood condition achieves the preset threshold level.The indicator 33 may of course provide a simple warning of achievement of the preset threshold, as by flashing lamp or. audible alarm. Fig. 4 provides further schematic indication of a feedback connection 35 which includes a selector switch 36, whereby for example in the switch position shown the output signal of detection means 30 may provide control of the output of pulse generator 13 in the alternative position of switch 36, the achievement of the preset threshold condition, manifest in the output signal of circuit 31, will be understood to be the means of automatic termination of generator 13 output to coil 11. Fig. 4 will be still further understood to illustrate that, although it is presently preferred to employ two coils 11 12 as discussed in connection with Fig. 1, the described blood control effects may also be achieved using but one such coil. The primary difference between one coil and two coil usage is in the degree of uniformity and depth of body penetration of the involved pulsed magnetic field. The following example, in connection with the graphsA to I of Fig. 5, will illustrate application of gamma ray tracer techniques as a means of quantitatively observing the ability of pulsed magnetic fields to enhance blood presence in the locality of field exposure, as compared to a corresponding but remote locality having insignificant field exposure. A dog is anesthetized and restrained so that the front legs are imaged by a gamma camera, with separate provision for simultaneously measuring detected gamma levels in the respective legs at a given time. A first pair of electrical coils 12 13 is strapped to opposite sides of one front leg, and a second pair of like coils is similarly strapped to the other front leg. The left coil pair is excited in the manner described above, while the other pair of coils is not excited and is therefore a dummy. Fig. 5 is a succession of graphical recordings of measured gamma levels, in each of the respective legs of the dog, at different times, and each curve carries legend identification of the applicable leg.For each of the successive recordings, the recording was made over the same period of time 40 seconds following injection of radioactive tracer solution, the latter having been selected for a short e.g., 5 seconds half life. Fig. 5A depicts an at rest condition, prior to which there has been no coil excitation and, therefore, no pulsed magnetic field exposure of either leg. The ratio of areas beneath the respective curves is 1.52 1, the predominance of blood being detected in the right.leg, for reasons which can only be presumed to be physical, as for example, the dog having normally always preferen tially favored primary reliance on his right leg.The curves of Fig. 5B were recorded 5 minutes later, as a check on conditions prior to magnetic pulse excitation the measured areas beneath the curves are in the ratio 1.63 1, again favoring the right leg, and substantially confirming the measurements of Fig. 5A. Having thus recorded the at rest condition, the coils on the left leg were excited, in the manner described for Fig. 1 and to the exclusion of the dummy coils on the right leg, thus exposing the left leg to activation by pulsed magnetic fields.At 5 minutes past commencement of activation, a further isotope injection and recording was made, accounting for the curves of Fig. 5C. In Fig. 5C, the predominance of blood presence is seen to have shifted, from the unexposed right leg to the exposed left leg, and the measured ratio of right leg left leg blood presence is 0.77 1. The injection and recording process was repeated at 10 minutes, 15 minutes and 20 minutes after commencement of activation, with recorded measurements as depicted in Figs. 5D, 5E and 5F, respectively. Area measurements beneath the curves. of these recordings yield right leg leftleg blood presence ratios of 0.50 1, 0.33 1, and 0.54, respectively. Apparently, response to continued activation peaks after about 15 minutes, by which time the presence of blood in the unfavored left leg as compared to the favored right leg has increased by a factor of about 5 times. Having made the recording for Fig. 5F, coilexcitation was terminated, and the injection measurement cycle was repeated at successive intervals which were 10 minutes, 20 minutes and 40 minutes post deactivation of the coils. The recordings of Figs. SG, 5H and SI, respectively, were made at end of these intervals, showing right left left leg blood presence ratios of 0.81 1, 1.18 1, and 1.65 1, the last of which will be recognized as certifying that the dog s blood presence condition has been returned to its original state, perFigs. 5A and 5B. The conclusion is clear that local predominance of tracer presence means local presence of blood presence.The pulsed magnetic fields have an effect akin to vasodilation, and they may be operative in the recruitment of capillaries in the localized region of body exposure. The pulsed magnetic field signals which evoked the data reported in connection with Fig. 5 can be described as repeated bursts of an asymmetrical pulse cycle wherein, for each pulse, a first polarity pulse portion is of relatively small amplitude and long duration e.g., 250 microseconds and an opposite polarity pulse portion is of relatively large amplitude and short duration e.g., 9 microsec onds maximum pulse amplitude is 1.6 millivolts burst duration is 30 milliseconds, burst repetition rate is 2 Hz, and the period between pulses of a burst is 22 microseconds. These pulse data will be seen to accord with the low power signal data specified for light weight battery powered portable equipment described in Ryaby, et al. pending application Serial No. 413,539, filed As measured by the probe technique described in said Ryaby, et al. patents. August 31, 1982, and in subsequent blood flow measurements on human beings, it has been confirmed that the same pulsed magnetic signals produce enhanced blood flow in humans, the measurements being made without resort to radioactive materials, using a laser Doppler technique. Further experiments suggest that certain fields may produce a result akin to vasoconstriction and that the effect of the pulsed magnetic fields on bloodcirculatory dynamics depends on the initial physiological condition at the time of implementation of the pulsed fields. While the invention has been described for various illustrative embodiments, it will be understood that modifications may be made without departure from the scope of the invention.
