# TRIGGERING DEVICE FOR A VACUUM ARC IN A PLASMA CENTRIFUGTRIGGERING DEVICE FOR A VACUUM ARC IN A PLASMA CENTRIFUGE E

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to an apparatus for producing a vacuum arc in a plasma centrifuge. The apparatus comprises a cathode 7 of a material from which the vacuum arc is formed and a trigger electrode 11 . A trigger circuit 27 is coupled to the trigger electrode for storing energy and then applying a break down voltage between the cathode and the trigger where the cathode breaks down and initiates the vacuum arc. A pulse forming circuit 9 is electrically coupled to the cathode for supplying a constant current pulse to the cathode to enhance the formation of a completely ionized plasma. The resistance of the pulse forming network 23 is lower than the impe dance of the vacuum arc. The present invention also is directed to an anode grid holder for use in the plasma centrifuge.
