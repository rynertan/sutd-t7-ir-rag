# Pressure swing adsorption process and apparatus.

## Abstract
A high pressure gas stream having a hydrogen content of up to about 90 mol percent is passed to a separator containing a permeable membrane capable of selectively permeating hydrogen. The separator is used to achieve a bulk separation of the desired hydrogen from impurities contained in the gas stream. The separated hydrogen is recovered at a reduced pressure and is passed to a pressure swing adsorption system adapted for operation at said reduced pressure. The off gas from the separator is reco vered essentially at the higher pressure of the gas stream. A portion of the off gas is throttled to a lower pressure, with appropriate power recovery, and is passed to the pressure swing adsorption system as a co feed gas, thereby contribut ing to the recovery of purified hydrogen product and to a reduction in the operating costs for the desired hydrogen separation and purification. The remaining off gas is reco vered as a relatively high pressure fuel or feed gas for other purposes.
