## Description
YARN STORING, FEEDING AND MEASURING DEVICEThe present invention relates a yarn storming, feeding and measuring device, particularly for jet looms, in accordance with the generic clause of claim 1. DE A 3123760 discloses a yarn storing, feeding and measuring device for jet looms having a stationary storage drum onto which an intermediate yarn store is wound by a winding on device and from which the yarn is withdrawn spiralling around the withdrawal end of the storage drum, yarn sensing means being arranged such that the yarn is passing its detection area during withdrawal from the drum, said yarn sensing means producing pulse signals, each pulse signal indicating that the yarn passes a detection area of the yarn sensing means, a plurality of yarn stopping devices being arranged at angular intervals around the storage drum said yarn stopping devices consisting of yarn stopping elements and actuator means moving said stopping elements into and out of the path of the yarn being withdrawn, and an actuator control device adjustable to desired yarn length to be withdrawn, said control device being responsive to said pulse signals in such a way that an actuating signal is transmitted to a selected yarn stopping device whose angular position corresponds to the position rendered by the yarn when said desired yarn length has been withdrawn. The yarn sensing means of this prior art device consists in a plurality of yarn sensors, each of said sensors being associated with a yarn stopping device.Hence, the number of yarn sensors required for such a prior art device corresponds to the number of yarn stopping devices Yarn storing, feeding and measuring devices of the above mentioned kind not only serve to intermediately storing the weft yarn on a storage drum, but also serve to supply the jet loom with a weft yarn having a desired length. For the latter purpose, this prior art device carries out the following steps in order to obtain the desired yarn length for each weft yarn insertion After releasing or deactuating the yarn stopping device actuated at the end of a previous yarn withdrawal cycle the yarn is withdrawn spiralling around the withdrawal end of the storage drum.Thereby, the yarn subsequently passes the detection areas of the plurality of yarn sensors being arranged at the withdrawal end of the storage drum in a spaced, angular relationship with respect to each other.Each yarn sensor generates a pulse signal indicating that the yarn passes its detectioi area, these pulse signals being fed to the control device. Hence, the control device receives a number of pulse signals, this number corresponding to the number of yarn sensors being passed by the yarn during the withdrawal. By counting the pulse signals received from the yarn sensor the control device generates a count value corresponding to the actual position of the withdrawal point of the yarn with respect to the yarn sensors. The count value corresponds to the length of yarn withdrawn from the storage drum.When the count value corresponds to the desired yarn length to be withdrawn, the control device actuates the stopping device being located with respect to the angular movement of the withdrawal point of the yarn behind the yarn sensor which generated the last pulse signal. Thereby, the withdrawal of the yarn is stopped so that the desired yarn length is obtained. This prior art device is costly and complicated due to the large number of yarn stopping sensors required to achieve a sufficiently large number of different yarn lengths. Furthermore, it is undesirable to have a large number of yarn sensors due to the fact that such yarn storing, feeding and measuring devices have to designed as compact as possible so as to meet with the technical requirements of the customers and users of such devices.A further drawback is caused by the fact that yarn sensors are also sensitive in operation, since they usually comprise optical elements which can be covered by lint. If one of the plurality of yarn sensors is covered by lint, it will no longer generate pulse signals when the yarn passes its detection area resulting in a wrong count value in the control device. Hence, the respective yarn length of the inserted weft yarn will become greater than the desired yarn length.DE A 3123760 also discloses a yarn storing, feeding and measuring device using only one yarn sensor for detecting the withdrawal of one complete turn of yarn at the withdrawal end of the drum. In order to be able to adjust the yarn length to be withdrawn, this prior art device makes use of a drurn whose diameter can be mechanically varied. The same concept is disclosed in FR A 2166332 and PCT A WO 82 04446. A mechanical adjustment of the diameter of the drum calls for complicated mechanical means which makes the device costly and liable to mai5unctons. The present invention seeks to improve the device of the above mentioned type se as to give it a simpler, cost saving structure and a more reliable function without giving up the advantage of adjustability of the yarn length to be withdrawn.This problem is solved in a device of the type referred to having the characterizing features of claim 1.The control device of the yarn storing, feeding and measuring device in accordance with the present invention comprises a storing means for storing information regarding the yarn stopping device actuated at the end of a previous yarn withdrawal cycle. This enables the control device to have information regarding the withdrawal point of the yarn to be withdrawn at the beginning of each w thdrawal cycle without requiring a yarn sensor associated to each yarn stopping device.The calculating means determines one yarn stopping device to be actuated next among the plurality of yarn stopping devices on the basis of input information for the calculating means representing the desired yarn length, which can be realised as a simple BCD switch connected to the calculating means, and on the basis of said stored information regarding the stopping device actuated at the end of a previous yarn withdrawal cycle.This new design enables the device in accordance with the present invention to determine the yarn stopping device to be actuated next without requiring any additional information regarding the withdrawal of the yarn after releasing the stopping device actuated at the end of a previous withdrawal cycle during the movement of the yarn between said released stopping device and the passing of the yarn through the detection area of the yarn sensor. This principle allows to essentially reduce the number of yarn sensors, as the number of yarn sensors becomes independent from the number of yarn stopping devices. In accordance with claim 2, the yarn sensing means can be realised as a single yarn sensor resulting in a very simple structure of the device and further resulting in a simple circuit design of the control device as the control device uses one input and amplifier circuit for connecting the yarn sensor to the calculating means. The device as described in claim 3 uses information regarding the stopping device actuated at the end of the previous withdrawal cycle which can be directly used as a basis for the determination of the yarn stopping device to be actuated next. Preferably, this stored information can be a number of the stopping device indicating its angular position with respect to said yarn sensor. Furthermore, it is possible to use the value of the angle between the stopping device and the yarn sensor as the stored information.Based on such stored information, the determination of the stopping device to be actuated next can be carried out by transforming the desired yarn length into position numbers of the stopping devices, and to determine the stopping device to be actuated next by stunning up the number of the stopping device actuated at the end of the previous withdrawal cycle and the number representing the desired yarn length, wherein this sum is reduced by a number corresponding to one complete turn of yarn, i.e. by the entire number of stopping devices if the sum exceeds said entire number of stopping devices.The calculating means of the preferred device in accordance with claim 4 carries out a very fast and reliable determination of the point of time for actuating the determined stopping device. For this purpose, the calculating means determines on the basis of the desired yarn length an actuation position of the withdrawal point of the yarn being withdrawn from the storage drum at which the determined stopping device is to be actuated. For having a time basis corresponding to the actual withdrawal speed of the yarn from the storage drum the calculating means measures the period of time between the occurrence of two subsequent pulse signals generated by the yarn sensor.Based on this information, the calculating means is enabled to carry out an estimation regarding the withdrawal point of the yarn being withdrawn from the storage drum with respect to the respective position of each yarn stopping device. The calculating means actuates the determined stopping device as soon as the calculated, i.e. estimated momentary position of the withdrawal point equals to said determined actuation position. A rough estimation of said actuation position resulting in the point of time for the actuation of the determined stopping device is sufficient as said determined stopping can be actuated as soon as the withdrawal point of the yarn has passed said stopping device one entire turn of withdrawal before it gets stopped by the stopping device.An extremely reliable operation of the device can be achieved when das çRng the calculating means such that it carries out the calculation steps indicated in claim 5 for determining the estimated, momentary position of the withdrawal point of the yarn. At the beginning of each withdrawal cycle the calculated momentary position is set to a value corresponding to the position of the previously actuated stopping device. After releasing the previously actuated stopping device this value is incremented with a pre determined rate. Preferably, the rate is chosen such that the calculated momentary position slips forward with respect to the actual position of the withdrawal point of the yarn. During incrementing said calculated, momentary position the calculating means repeatedly checks whether the momentary position equals to the position of a yarn sensor or whether the calculated momentary position equals to the actuation position. If the first condition is fulfilled, the calculating means holds the calculated, momentary position and checks whether the yarn sensor generates a pulse signal.By adaptedly choosing the predetermined rate for the incrementation of the calculated, momentary position, the calculating means only holds the calculated, momentary position and checks whether the yarn store sensor generates a pulse signal during a very short period of time, which can be considered as a time window for checking whether the yarn sensor generates a pulse signal. This enables the calculating means to work with high reliability as noise peaks which might occur before and after opening and closing the tinini. are disregarded.As soon as the calculating means receives a pulse signal generated by the yarn sensor, it further prosecutes the calculation with the step of incrementing the calculated, momentary position, as the generation of said pulse signal indicated that the calculated momentary position equals to the rB1 position of the withdrawal point of the yarn. As soon as the momentary position of the withdrawal point of the yarn equals to the actuation position, the calculating means actuates the determined stopping devisee by supplying it with an actuation current.By choosing the advantages designed as claimed in claim 6 it is guaranteed that the movement of the stopping element of the determined stopping device has been completed even when making use of relatively siow stopping devices in high speed yarn storing, feeding and measuring devices which usually withdraw the yarn from the storage drum with a rotational speed of about 10 milliseconds per revolution. Mbre particularly, the actuation position of the with dratml point of the yarn being withdrawn from the storage drum is determined such that the period of time lapsing during the movement of the withdrawal point of the yarn from said actuation position to the position of the stopping element of the determined stopping device is preferably 1 5 milliseconds greater than the response time of said stopping device, said response time being defined by the time delay between feeding an actuation current to the actuator means of the stopping device and the completing of the movement of the stopping element. In case the response time is in the order of 5 milliseconds, the stopping device will thus be actuated 6 10 milliseconds before the withdrawal point of the yarn arrived at the position of the stopping element of the determined stopping device.Claims 4 6 teach how to use a calculated,momentary position of the withdrawal point of the yarn as a basis for timely actuating the determined stopping device. While, particularly, these claims describe how the calculating means controls the actuation of the determined stopping device to be actuated next by estimating the position of the withdrawal point of the yarn and by periodically correcting said posItion each time when the yarn sensor generates the pulse signal.Claims 7 9 include a modified teaching when compared with the teaching of claims 4 6 in the respect that the calculation of a momentary position of the withdrawal point is replaced by a timecalculation. Thi each of these two cases the calculating means can be a simple standard microprocessor being adapted to these purposes by a few interface circuits and by a short programme for carrying out the respective calculation. In accordance with claim 7, the calculating means determines on the basis of the desired yarn length an actuation time defining the period time between releasing the stopping device actuated at the end of a previous withdrawal cycle and actuating the determined stopping device to be actuated next. There is a linear dependency between the desired yarn length and the actuation time, so that the information regarding the desired yarn length can be used as a basis for calculating said actuation time. The calculating means calculates the period of time lapsed since the releasing or deactuation of said stopping device actuated at the end of the previous withdrawal cycle and periodically corrects this calculation of the period of time on the basis of the respective periods of time between two subsequent pulse signals received from the yarn sensor.By doing so, the calculation of the period of time can be adapted to a varying speed of withdrawing the yarn from the storage drum. In other words, the respective period of time between two subsequent pulse signals serves as a time basis for the calculation of the period of time lapsed since the rye easing or deactuation of the stopping device actuated at the end of the previous withdrawal cycle. As soon as the calculated period of time corresponds to the determined actuation time, the calculatLrg means generates an actuation signal for actuating the actuator means of the determined stopping device.By designing the calculating means as claimed in claim 8 the calculated period of time lapsed since the releasing or deactuation of the stopping device actuated at the end of the previous withdrawal cycle can be considered as a representation of the momentary position or angular position of the withdrawal point of the yarn being withdrawn from the storage drum. By doing so,the generation of one pulse signal per revolution of the yarn withdrawn from the storage drum is sufficient to generate information regarding the course of the withdrawal point.When designing the calculating means of the device as claimed in 9, a simple and reliable correction of the calculated time with respect to the period of time between two subsequent pulse signals generated by a yarn sensor is achieved. Preferably, the calculating means is a microprocessor having a memory. One storage cell thereof stores the calculated value representing the calculated period of time. At the beginning of each cycle said value is reset to zero by said calculating means when releasing or deactuating the stopping device actuated at the end of the previous withdrawal cycle. Hereinafter, the calculating means increments said value with a pre determined rate and periodically checks whether said value equals to the actuation time, or whether said value equals to a pre set time.This pre set time is chosen to be a few percent, preferably 10 smaller than the period of time lapsing during the withdrawal of one turn of yarn from the storage drum. Furthermore, the calculating means checks whether said value equals to said pre set time multiplied by n, n being a whole number greater than zero. By doing so, the calculating means detects whether said value equals to multiples of the period of time lapsing during the withdrawal of one turn of yarn from the storage drum. In case the value equals to the actuation time, the calculating means generates the actuation signal.In case said value equals to a pre set time or a multiple thereof, the calculating means holds said value and checks whether the yarn sensor generates the next pulse signal. By doing so, the calculating means generates a time window for checking whether the yarn sensor generates the next pulse signal. This feature reduces the sensitivity of the device with respect to noise peaks, as the signal received from the yarn sensor is only considered during a very small timewindow during which the pulse is expected to occur. As soon as the pulse is detected, the calculating means further prosecutes the calculation with the above mentioned incrementation of said value.As the calculating means of the devices as claimed in claims 4 9 generate information regarding the momentary withdrawal point of the yan on the storage drum, the calculating means has also continuous inftmation regarding the momentary length of the withdrawn yarn. This information regarding the momentary length of the withdraws yarn can be preferably used for controlling further operations of the jet loom which have to be carried out in dependency from the momentary length of the yarn withdrawn from the storage drum. Preferred devices making use of said information are claimed in claims 10 12.Usually, devices for a jet loom have a jet nozzle for inserting the weft yarn during the process of weaving by means of compressed air, wherein the jet of compressed air generated by the jet nozzle can be controlled by means of an electromagnetic valve operable by a driving current for controlling the feeding of compressed air to said nozzle.Usually, the controlling of said electromagnetic valve has been carried out in synchronism with the rotation of the main shaft of the weaving machine. In such a control, the opening of the valve for feeding compressed air to the jet nozzle has to be carried out a relatively long period of time before deactuating the stopping device actuated at the end of the previous withdrawal cycle for guaranteeing that the jet of compressed air has completely established before deactuating said stopping device. This relatively long period of time was necessary due to the fact that there did not exist a direct synchronism between the operation of the feeding device and the operation of the Jet loom.For the same reason, the valve of the jet nozzle is clcsed a relatively long period of time after actuating the next stopping device at the end of the withdrawal cycle. The energy caused for generating compressed air has been essentially increased in recent years so that it has become desirable to reduce the consumption of compressed air as far as possible.Claims 10 12 teach how to use the information regarding the withdrawn length cf yarn as contained in the calculating means of the devices in accordance with claims 4 9 for effectively reducing the consumption of compressed air by controlling the electromagnetic valve by means of the calzulating means in time dependency from the actuation of the respective stopping devices.In accordance with claim 11, the consumption of compressed air can be reduced by closing the valve of the jet nozzle a pre determined period of time before activating the determined stopping device to be actuated next. By adaptedly choosing said pre determined period of time the tension of the yarn being withdrawn from the storage drum is essentially reduced shortly before actuating the stopping device. By doing so, the actuation force of the stopping device can be also essentially reduced so that smaller, faster and cheaper stopping devices can be used. By reducing the tension of the yarn shortly before the withdrawal is stopped by an actuated stopping device, it is possible to take care Ot sensitive and weak yarns. When carrying out the device in accordance with claim 12, an optimal time dependency between the respective actuation and deactuation of the stopping devices and between the respective opening and closing of the valve of the jet nozzle is achieved, as the desired tension of the yarn is established by means of the jet of compressed air when deactuating the stopping device actuated at the end of the previous withdrawal cycle and as the tension of the yarn is rapidly reduced shortly before actuating the next stopping device.When carrying out the device as claimed in claim 13, a very simple and cost saving design can be achieved.A further, anzntHBrus development of the device is claimed in claims 14 and 15. In prior art devices the respective yarn stopping element consists of a metal pin. It has turned out that the sharp edge between the cylindrical wall and the plain, circular upper surface thereof often causes a damaging of the yarn when the yarn is pressed over this sharp edge during deactuation or releasing of said prior art stopping device.Furthermore, the relatively great upper surface of such a pin is liable to stick against a metal core of an electrsmagnetic coil serving as an actuator means The devices in accordance with claims 14 and 15 overcome these drawbacks of the prior art devices by replacing said metal pin of the yarn stopping element of a metal ball being movably disposed in a radial bore provided In a guiding portion located close to the withdrawal end of the storage drum. Preferably, the guiding portion is secured to the withdrawal end of the storage drum.Each actuator means comprises an electromagnetic coil being arranged in spaced relationship to said guiding portion so as to define a gap between the guiding portion and the coil. iten supplying the coil with the actuation current, the metal ball is attracted by the coil so that the metal ball moves into the gap for stopping the withdrawal of the yarn. Also it is possible to move the metal ball back into the bore by mechanical means after switching off the actuation current, it has turned out to be a more cost saving and simple design to use a permanent magnet for this purpose, said magnet being located at one end of said bore.A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the attached drawings.Figure 1 shows a side view of a device in accordance with the present invention, partially and cross sectional representation Figure 2 shows a front view of the device as shown in Figure 1 Figures 3 and 4 show details of the device shown in Figures 1 and 2 Figure 5 shows a circuit diagram of a control device of the device shown in Figures 1 4, andFigure 5 shows a flow diagram used in a microprocessor of the control device as shown in Figure 5. Referring now to Figure 1, a feeding device 1 consists of a storage drum 2 , a winding on device 3 or orbiting feeder tube 3 and an electric motor 4 . A yarn F being supplied to the orbiting feeder tube 3 driven by the electric motor 4 is wound onto the storage drum 2 . This storage drum is a stationary storage drum being maintained in a stationary position with respect to its environment by a magnetic means not shown here . Devices of this type are known per se in the art. For purposes of the present disclosure, it should be noted that this art is exemplified by US PS 3776480 and byUS PS 3843153. The feeding device 1 is provided with a storage sensor 5j being located close to the generally cylindrical surface of the storage drum 2 .This storage sensor 5 can be a so called maximum sensor preferably consisting of a light emitting device and a light serswng de vlce This storage sensor 5 generates a signal indicating the amount of yarn stored on the drum, i.e. the number of turns of yarn wound onto the drum. Based on this signal, a storage control unit 7 controls the operation of the electric motor 4 in such a way that there is continuously a sufficient amount of yarn available on the yarn storage drum 2 . Storage control units 7 are per se knorrn in the art For purposes of the present disclosure, it should be noted that this art is exemplified by DE OS 2908743,FR A 1562223 and PCT EP83 00121 applicant s own .As shown in Figure 1, there is disposed a yarn sensing means 6 at the withdrawal end of the storage drum arranged such that the yarn is passing its detection area during withdrawal from the drum 2 .This yarn sensing means preferably consists of a single yarn sensor 6 producing pulse signals, each pulse signal indicating that the yarn F passes a detection area of the yarn sensor 6 This sensor 6 could also be located in front of the withdrawal end of the storage drum, but has to be arranged such that the yarn is passing its detection area during withdrawal from the storage drum 2 . A yarn stopping device 10 located at the withdrawal end of the storage drum 2 consists of an actuator means 11 comprising a plurality of electromagnetic coils 11 , a plurality of coil cores 12 , each of the electromagnetic coils 11 being wound around a coil core 12 supported of a balloon limiting ring 13 consisting of two U shaped rings covering said plurality of electromagnetic coils 11 .Said balloon limiting ring 13 is fixedly secured to the environment of the feeding device 1 , for example,to a base plate thereof. A ring shaped guiding portion 16 is connected to the withdrawal end of the storage drum 2 . Said guiding portion 16 supports a plurality of yarn stopping elements 14 , each of said yarn stopping elements 14 consisting of a metal ball 14 being movably disposed in a radial bore 15 provided in the guiding portion 16 .As shown in Figures 3 and 4, the respective electromagnetic coils 11 and associated cores 12 are arranged opposite to said bores 15 .The balloon limiting ring 13 and the guiding portion 16 define a gap 18 being preferably in the order of 1 2 millimeters. The yarn F passes said gap when being withdrawn from the storage drum. A permanent magnet 17 is located at one end of each bore 15 for moving back said metal ball 14 into said bore 15 after switching off an actuation current fed to the respective electromagnetic coils 11 . As shown in Figures 3 and 4, bore 15 is attracted by the magnetic force of coil 11 when switching on the actuation current fed to coil 11 . The width of the gap 18 corresponds to the radius of the metal ball 15 . When the coil 11 is not activated, the permanent magnet 17 will attract the metal ball 14 , so that the ball will be completely positioned inside the bore 15 , so that the yarn F can be freely withdrawn in the axial direction from the storage drum 2 .The magnetic force of each electromagnetic coil 11 is chosen such that this force will overcome the attraction force of the permanent magnet 17 when feeding the actuation current to the coil 11 .The metal ball 14 will thereby move outwardly in the radial direction of the bore 15 and come into contact with the free end of the coil core 12 . In this condition, approximately half of the metal ball locks the gap 18 for the passage of the yarn F in such a way that the withdrawal of the yarn F from the storage drum 2 is terminated. When switching off the actuation current fed to the coil 11 , the tension in the yarn F being pulled at the beginning of the weft yarn insertion co acts with the magnetic force of the permanent magnet 17 such that the metal ball 14 will return to its starting position so as to come into contact with the permanent magnet 17 .As the tension of the yarn co acts with the magnetic force of the permanent magnet 17 due to the shape of the metal ball 14 , the holding force of the permanent magnet 17 can be relatively low. Hence, only a small portion of the attracting force generated by the electromagnetic coil 11 is required for overcoming the magnetic force on the permanent magnet 17 . For this reason the yarn stopping device 10 in accordance with the present invention is working faster than prior art devices using stopping elements 14 which are needle shaped or pin shaped.For further enhancing the operation of the yarn stopping device 10 , a thin plate of nonmagnetic material can be positioned at the outer end of the permanent magnet 17 and or on the free end of the coil core 12 for eliminating a magnetic sticking or adhesion between the metal ball 14 and the permanent magnet 17 and or the coil core 12 .The stopping element 14 can also have the form of a short cylindrical pin with a plain inner end directed to the permanent magnet 17 and a rounded, preferably semi spherical outer end.Referring now to Figure 5, the control device 8 will be hereinafter descibed in detail. The control device 8 comprises a calculating means 20 which is a standard microprocessor. The microprocessor 20 is preferably a microprocessor of the type 8748, manufactured by the 1NTEL Corporation. The yarn sensor 6 is connected to an input 21 of a yarn sensor interface circuit 22 . The yarn sensor interface circuit 22 essentially consists in an operational amplifier 23 connected through a diode 24 and a resistor 25 in parallel connection to diode t24 to an inverter gate 26 , the output thereof being connected to input pins Nos 1 and 6 of the microprocessor 20 . The input terminals of the inverter gate 26 are connected to ground via a capacitor 27 .The gain of the operational amplifier 23 can be adjusted by a variable gain control resistor 28 connected to the operational amplifier 23 . When a pulse is generated by the yarn sensor 6 , it will current amplified by the operational amplifier 23 . The output current of the operational amplifier 23 passes the diode 24 and charges the capacitor 27 .When the pulse signal goes back to zero potential, the capacitor 27 is discharged through resistors 25 , 29 and 30 to ground. Due to the switching threshold of the inverter gate 26 , only pulses of a pre deter,ined voltage are detected, so that the yarn sensor interface circuit 22 disregards small noise voltages. As the capacitor can be quickly charged through diode 24 and is only slowly discharged through resistors 25 , 29 and 30 , short input pulses are transfonred to longer output pulses as generated by gate 26 . Such a broadening of the very short input pulses enables the microprocessor 20 to reliably detect the input pulses.The microprocessor 20 is supplied with pulse signals generated by a crystal resonator 31 connected to input pins N. 2 and 3 of the microprocessor.A trigg input 32 receives a signal picked up at the main shaft of the loom. In s signal is applied to the input of an opto electronical coupling element 33 , the output thereof being connected to pin No. 39 of the microprocessor 20 . The trigg signal serves to synchronize the operation of the loom with the operation of the microprocessor 20 controlling the yarn storing, feeding and measuring device 1 . Mbre particularly, the occurrence of the triggsignal indicates that the next weft yarn is to be inserted.A reset input 34 is connected through a reset input interface circuit 35 to input pin No. 5 of the microprocessor 20 . Each time the main power of the device is switched on, a reset pulse is fed to the reset input 34 so as to reset the microprocessor 20 for ensuring that the calculation carried out by the microprocessor 20 begins with the first step of the programme.Input pins No. 7, 20 and 25 of the microprocessor 29 are connected to ground.Pins Nos. 12 19 of the microprocessor 20 are connected through aSIL resistor network 36 to a 5 volt potential. Said SILresistor network 3tri consists of eight resistors, each of them connecting one of these input pins with the 5 volt potential. Hence, each of the input pins Nos. 12 19 of the microprocessor 20 usually have a potential of 5 volt. Input pins Nos. 16 19 are connectable to ground via a so called DIP switch 37 . Input pin No. 19 of the microprocessor 20 is connected to a test switch 33 , wherein the second input terminal of said test switch 38 is connected to ground.By adaptively setting the DIP switch 37 and by opening and closing of the test switch 38 a desired bit combination can be fed to input pins Nos 16 19 of the microprocessor 20 causing the actuation and deactuation of a respective group of stopping devices 10 by ss sitchin on our switching off an actuation current fed to their associated elentromegnetic coils 11 . By doing so, it is possible to check the correct operation of the respective yarn stopping devices.Such a checking can be considered as a test operation of the respective yarn stopping devices. There is provided a yarn length setting switch 39 , preferably consisting of three BCD switches 40 42 , each BOD switch 40 42 having four input terminals and one output terminal. Each of theBCD switches can be set to a decimal number from zero 9. This decimal number is converted by the respective BCD switch 40 42 such that the corresponding one of its four input terminals is connected to its output terminal in accordance with the BCD code. When for example setting one of the BCD switches 40 42 to the decimal number 5, then its first and third input terminal is connected to its output terminal, wherein its second and fourth input terminal is disconnected from the output terminal.The respective first input termins of the BCD switches 40 42 are connected via diodes to input pin No. 12 of the microprocessor 20 , the respective second input terminals of the BCD switches 40 42 are connected via diodes to input pin No. 13 of the microprocessor 20 , the respective third input terminal of the BCD switches 40 42 are connected via diodes to input pin No. 14 of the microprocessor 20 and the respective fourth input terminals of the BCD switches 40 42 are connected via diodes to input pin No.15 of the microprocessor 20 . The respective output terminals of the BCD switches 40 42 are connected to input pins Nos. 36 38 of the microprcoesscr 20 . Due to the provision of the SIL resistor network 36j, each of the input pins Nos. 12 15 of the microprocessor 20 are in their normally high state. Usually, although the input pins Nos. 36 38 of the microprocessor 20 are in the normally high state. For reading the BCD value of one of the switches 40 42 , the microprocessor 20 pulls down the voltage of one of its input pinsNos. 36 38.For example, for reading the BCD value of BCD switch 40 , the microprocessor sets its input pin No. 36 to zero potential, i.e. to the low logical state . In case the decimal number selected by switch 40 is 5 I the voltage of input pins Nos. 12 and 14 of the microprscessor 20 will be pulled down to zero potential, i.e.to the tlo W logical state, wherein the logical state of input pinsNos. 13 and 15 remains at high logical state.Reference numeral 43 designates a reset line 43 connected through a reset interface circuit 44 to a reset input pin No. 4 of the microprocessor 20 . Each time the main power of the loom is switched on, a pulse signal is fed to the reset line 43 for resetting the microprocessor 20 . In other words, this reset line guarantees that the microprocessor begins to carry out the control programme with the first step after switching on the main power of the loom.Output pins Nos. 27 34 of the microprocessor 20 are connected to input pins Nos. 18 of an amplifier circuit 45 , this amplifier circuit 45 having eight output terminals number 11 18, each of these output terminals being associated to a respective input pin.When receiving an input signal of high logical state at its input pins Nos. 1 8, the amplifier circuit 45 connects the corresponding output terminal te a voltage source having a potential of 35 volts.Each of the output terminals Nos. 11 of the amplifier circuit 45 is connected to three electromagnetic coils 11 . Twenty four electromagnetic coils 11 associated to twenty four yarn stopping devices 10 are arranged as a matrix having eight rows and three columns. The respective output terminals of the electromagnetic coils 11 arranged in one column are connected to a respective one of three c Sput lines 46 48 .Output pins Nos. 22 24 are connected to respective first input terminals of N tANDates 49 51 , the respective second input terminal of these NAND gates 49 51 being connected to output pin No. 21 of the microprecessor 20 . The output terminals of the NAND gates 49 51 are respectively connected through current amplifier circuits 52 54 to a respective pair of input pins Nos. 1 6 of a amplifier circuit 55 . Thds amplifier circuit 55 includes three pairs of output terminals Nos. 11 16, each pair being connected to a respective one of the lines 46 48 . When receiving a high logical signal at one of its pairs of input terminals, the amplifier circuit 55 connects the corresponding pair of output terminals to a voltage source having a 5 volt potential.Due to the above described circuit arrangement, the microprocessor 20 is enabled to energize one of the twenty four electromagnetic coils 11 by generating a high output signal at one of the output pins Nos. 27 34 determining the row of the coil 11 to be actuated, by generating an enable signal at its output pin No. 21 and by generating a high output signal at one of its output pins Nos 22 24 selecting the column of the electromagnetic coil 11 to be actuated. The above described matrix arrangement allows to actuate one electromagnetic coil 11 among the twenty four electromagnetic coils 11 with only eleven output pins Nos. 22 24, 27 34.The microprocessor 20 generates a strobe signal at its output pin No. 21 causing a periodical switching on and off of the actuation current flolnng through the selected one of the electromagnetic coils 11 . By strobing the actuation current it is possible to reduce the average power consumption although a high magnetic actuation force generated by the selected electromagnetic coil 11 can be maintained due to the high peak value of the actuation current. It has turned out that a high magnetic force as generated by the determined electromagnetic coil 11 is only necessary for moving the stopping element 1lot into the actuated position. Such a high magnetic force is generated during the first peak of the subsequent row of peaks of the actuation current fed to said coil 11 . The average magnetic holding force corresponding to the average level of the subsequent peaks of the actuation current can be chosen to be essentially lower for maintaining the actuated stopping element 14 in the yarn stop position.By adaptively choosing the time relationship between on and off 11 periods of time of the actuation current it is possible to adapt the time dependency of the magnetic force as generated by the actuation current flowing through the determined electromagnetic coil 11 to the required time dependency of the actuation force of the corresponding yarn stopping device 10 .Output pin No. 34 of the microprocessor 20 is connected through a current amplifier 56 to a light emitting element 57 , which in turn is connected to ground via a resistor 58 . The light emitting element 57 actuates an opto sensitive switching element 59 actuating a stop motion relay not shown here of the weaving machine.Output pin No. 35 of the microprocessor 20 is connected through a current amplifier 60 to a light emitting element 61 , which in turn is connected via a resistor 62 to ground. The light emitting element 61 actuates an opto sensitive switching element 63 , which in turn is connected to a relay controlling the operation of the valve of the main jet nozzle of the loom not shown here . The amplifier circuit 45 is a standard circuit element of the type UDN 2580A . The amplifier circuit 55 is also a standard circuit element of the type UCN 2002A . Both amplifier circuits are available from SPRAGUE Corporation.Referring now to Figure 6, there is shown a flow diagram of the control programme stored in the read only memory of the microprocessor 20 . When receiving a reset signal, the microprocessor 20 is reset so as to start the carrying out of the programme with the first instruction thereof, being the START instruction.At programme step No. 1, the microprocessor 20 actuates a predetermined yarn stopping device 10 for locking the yarn F in its start position. Preferably, said stopping device 10 is selected such that its angular position is 1800 offset with respect to the angular position of the yarn sensor 6 . The microprocessor 20 stores the number or the angular position of said stopping device in a pre determined storage cell of its RAM.At programme step No. 2, the microprocessor 20 consecutively reads the BCD code of the switches representing the desired weft yarn length and stores the corresponding BCD codes in predetermined storage cells of its RAM.At programme step No 3, the microprocessor 20 transfers the BCDcodes representing the desired weft yarn length to a digital value corresponding to the number of revolutions and 1 24 revolutions, wherein this digital value represents the revolutions of the withdrawal point of the yarn during the withdrawal of the desired weft yarn length. it s also possible to express said desired weft yarn length by a value corresponding to the time required for withdrawing said desired weft yarn length.At programme step No. 4, is a waiting routine, causing the microprocessor 20 to await the receipt of a trigg signal from the weaving machine before going to programme step No. 5. This waiting routine is realised by a programme loop periodically checking whether the trigg signal occurs. If said condition is fulfilled, the microprocessor continues with the programme step No. 5.At programme step No. 5, the microprocessor generates a thigh signal at its output pin No. 35 for actuating the relay controlling the valve of the main jet nozzle in the weaving machine.At programme step No. 6, the stopping device 10 actuated during programme step No. 1 is deactuated for releasing the yarn F . At programme step No. 7, the microprocessor 20 checks whether the yarn passes the yarn sensor by repeatedly checking the logical states of its input pins Nos. 1 and 6. If this condition is fulfilled, the microprocessor 20 continues with programme step No. 8.At programme step No. 8, the microprocessor 20 begins with the measuring of the time lapsing since the generation of the pulse signal indicating the passing of the yarn through the detection area of the yarn sensor 6 .At programme step No. 9, the microprocessor 20 again carries out a waiting loop corresponding to the waiting loop of programme step No. 7.As soon as the yarn has past the yarn sensor 6 , microprocessor 20 continues with the programme step No. 10.At programme step lt. 10, the microprocessor 20 stores the time between twc subsequent pulse signal as received from yarn sensor 6 .The micropronessor 20 then starts again to measure the time.At programme step No. 11, the microprocessor 20 calculates at which yarn position the main jet nozzle is to be switched off.At programme step No. 12, the microprocessor 20 calculates at which yarn position the stopping device 10 determined during programme step No. 3 is to be actuated.At programme step No. 13, the microprocessor 20 calculates the momentary position of the yarn based on the actual yarn withdrawal speed being measured during programme step No. 10.At programme step No. 14, the microprocessor 20 checks whether the calculated, momentary position of the yarn as determined during programme step No. 13 equals to the yarn position determined during programme step No. 11. If this condition is fulfilled, the microprocessor 20 continues with programme step No. 15. If not, it continues with programme step No. 16. At programme step No. 15, the microprocessor 20 switches off the main jet nozzle by pulling down its output pin No. 35 to zero potential.At programme step No. 16, the microprocessor 20 checks whether the calculated, momentary position of the yarn as determined during programme step No. 13 corresponds to the yarn position as calculated during programme step No. 12. If so, the microprocessor 20 goes to programme step No. 23. Otherwise, it continues with carrying out programme step No. 17.At programme step No. 17, the microprocessor 20 checks whether the calculated position as determined during programme step No. 13 is close to the position of the yarn sensor 6 . By doing so, a timewindow is realised. In case this condition is not fulfilled, the microprocessor 20 goes back to programme step No. 13. If it is fulfilled, it continues with programme step No. 18.At programme step No. 18, the microprocessor 20 again checks whether the yarn past the yarn sensor 6 . This programme step corresponds to programme step No. 7. If this condition is fulfilled, the microprocessor 20 continues with programme step No. 19. Otherwise, it continues with programme step No. 20.At programme step No. 19, the microprocessor 20 stores the measured time between two subsequent pulse signals as received from yarn sensor 6 and goes back to programme step No. 13 At programme step No. 20 is a safety routine for checking whether a yarn breakage occurred. This safety routine is realised by comparing the calculated time with a time threshold which is only exceeded in case of a yarn breakage. In other words, the microprocessor 20 checks whether the measured time lapsed since the last passing of the yarn through the detection area of the yarn sensor 6 exceeds a time threshold. If this condition is not fulfilled, the microprocessor 20 continues with programme step No. 18, wherein otherwise it goes to programme step No. 21. At programme step No. 21, the weaving machine is stopped since a yarn breakage has occurred. For this purpose, the microprocessor 20 generates a high logical potential signal at its output pin No. 34.At programme step No. 22, the microprocessor 20 goes back to the start instruction of the programme when having received a resetsignal.At programme step No. 23, the microprocessor 20 actuates the stopping device 10 for stopping the yarn withdrawal. Furthermore, the microprocessor 20 stores the number of the actuated stopping device in a predetermined storage cell of its RAM.At programme step No. 24, the microprocessor 20 checks whether the trigg signal as received at programme step No. 4 has disappeared in the meantIme. As soon as the trigg signal disappears, the microprocessor goes to programme step No. 25.At programme step No. 25, the microprocessor 20 carries out a programme step corresponding to programme step No. 2. At programme step No. 26, the microprocessor 20 carries out a programme step corresponding to programme step No. 3.At programme step No. 27 is a waiting routine for repeatedly checking whether a triGg signal is fed to the trigg input 32 . Such a triggsignal indicates that the loom is ready for the insertion of a further weft yarn. As soon as the trigg signal is generated, the microprocessor 20 goes to programme step No. 28.At programme step No. 28, the microprocessor 20 switches on the main jet nozzle of the weaving machine by generating a high logical potential signal at ouput pin No. 35.At programme step No. 29, the microprocessor 20 deactuates the stopping device actuated when carrying out the programme step No. 23.The microprocessor 20 then goes back to programme step No. 11.
