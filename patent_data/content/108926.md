# Method and apparatus for magnetically holding a cast metal ribbon against a belt.

## Abstract
A continuous casting assembly has a pair of counter rotating belts 16, 20 for controllably forming a continuous elongated cast ribbon 18 . One of the belts is a chilled substrate 15 for receiving molten metal discharged from a dispensing nozzle 14 . The other belt 20 is positioned immediately adjacent the chilled substrate belt and contact able. Both of the belts are moved in a substantially parallel path at the same predetermined speed with the cast ribbon interposed between the belts. Magnetic forces 36 are used to urge the two belts together in contacting relationship with each other and with the interposed cast ribbon.
