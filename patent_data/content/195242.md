## Description
NON DIMER POLYAMIDES HAVING IMPROVED WATER SOLUBILITY USEFUL AS FLEXOGRAPHIC GRAVURE INK BINDERS FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to polyamide resins having improved water solubility which are useful as flexographic gravure ink binders. More particularly, this invention relates to polyamide resins which are essentially free of dimeric and higher polymeric fat acids. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION U.S. Patent No. 3,776,865 to Glaser and Lovald discloses polyamide resins obtained by reacting an acid component comprised of a polymeric fat acid and another dicarboxylic acid with an amine component comprising isophorone diamine or mixtures thereof with an alkylene diamine. The patentees disclose that these resins are useful as binders applied by aqueous systems, particularly in flexographic gravure inks where water reducibility is desired. Polyamide resins prepared from dimeric and or higher polymeric fatty acids for use in flexographic gravure inks are dissolved in volatile organic solvents, such as the lower alkanols. Environmental concern over the amounts of volatile organic solvents in the atmosphere has led to a desire to use aqueous solutions that have less volatile organic solvents contained therein. In order to accommodate the reduced levels of volatile organic solvents, the polyamide resins used as binders in flexographic gravure inks should have increased water solubility and yet retain the other desirable properties of polyamide resins, based on polymeric fat acids. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides polyamide resin compositions formed from a mixture comprising i about X equivalent percent of a medium chain dicarboxylic acid having from 13 to 25 aliphatic carbon atoms ii about Y equivalent percent of a short chain acid selected from the group consisting of a a short chain acyclic aliphatic dicarboxylic acid having from 2 to 8 aliphatic carbon atoms b a short chain aliphatic monocarboxylic acid having from 3 to 5 aliphatic carbon atoms, and c mixtures thereof and iii about Z equivalent percent of a diamine having from 2 to 12 aliphatic carbon atoms or mixtures thereof wherein the ratio of Z to the sum of X and Y is less than 1. The preferred polyamides are those wherein the ratio of Z to the sum of X and Y is less than about 0.9, more preferably ranges from about 0.50 to about 0.85, and most preferably from about 0.65 to about 0.85. The invention also provides binder compositions for flexographic gravure ink compositions containing such resins. It has been found that the polyamide resins of this invention are more soluble in flexographic gravure ink compositions containing more water and less volatile organic solvent than flexographic gravure ink compositions containing polyamide resins based on polymeric fat acids.In spite of this increased water solubility, however, the polyamide resins yield ink coatings with acceptable water resistance and other desirable properties. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The polyamide resins of the present invention are prepared by polymerizing a mixture which contains at least two different carboxylic acids with at least one di amine. These resins are acid terminated resins in that an equivalent excess of the dicarboxylic acids are used in relation to the di amine. A monobasic acid can be used as a chain stopper. The ratio of equivalents of the diamines to the equivalents of the acids is therefore less than 1, preferably less than about 0.9, more preferably ranges from about 0.50 to about 0.85, and most preferably about 0.65 to 0.85. The carboxylic acids useful in the present invention can be divided into two groups on the basis of chain length The acids of one group have medium chain length and the acids of the other group have shortchain length. The medium chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, i.e. those having from 13 to 25 aliphatic carbon atoms, are present in all of the polyamide resins of this invention. The other group of acids, i.e. the short chain carboxylic acids used to prepare the polyamide resins of this invention, can be further subdivided into two groups on the basis of functionality.In general, it is preferred that the short chaln acyclic aliphatic dicarboxylic acids be used to the exclusion of the short chain aliphatic monocarboxylic acids, especially when the diamine chosen is isophorone dl amine, and that the short chain aliphatic monocarboxylic acids be used to the exclusion of the short chain acyclic aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, especially when the diamine chosen is ethylene diamtne. The medium chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids hereinafter referred to as the medium chain diacid necessary in this invention have from 13 to 25 aliphatic carbon atoms, preferably from 16 to 21. This class of dicarboxylic acids includes not only the homologous series beginning with dodecanedioic acid and extending to the 24 carbon diacid, but also includes dicarboxylic acids that have branched alkyl chains and alicyclic structures in the molecule as well. A preferred class of medium chain diacid are those having a carbocyclic ring and three substituents wherein one substituent is a carboxyl group, a second substituent is an alkyl group having more than three aliphatic carbon atoms, and a third substituent is an alkyl group that is terminally substituted with a carboxyl group. Examples of the medium chain diacid of this preferred class may be obtained as the DielsAlder reaction products of acrylic acid with a fatty acid having two conjugated ethylenic unsaturations. A preferred example of the mediumchain diacid is 2 n hexyl 5 7 carboxyl n heptyl cyclohex 3 ene carboxylic acid which is available from Westvaco, Charleston Heights,South Carolina, as Westvaco DiAcid. The short chain acyclic aliphatic dicarboxylic acids hereinafter referred to as short chain diacid useful in this invention have from 2 to 8 aliphatic carbon atoms in an unbranched hydrocarbon chain. The short chain diacid can be characterized as a homologous series of dicarboxylic acids which begins with ethanedloic acid, ends with decanedioic acid, and includes each member in between. The preferred shortchain diacid are azaleic acid and adipic acid. The amounts of short chain diacid and medium chain diacid used In the polyamides of this invention are preferably chosen such that the ratio of equivalents of the short chain diacid to equivalents of the medium chain diacid range from about 4 1 to about 0.66 1, more preferably from about 3 1 to about 0.8 1, and most preferably from about 1 1 to 2 1. The short chain aliphatic monocarboxylic acids hereinafter referred to as short chain monoacid useful in this invention have from 3 to 5 aliphatic carbon atoms. The short chain acids are exemplified by propionic acid, n butanoic acid, isobutanoic acid, and the like. The preferred short chain acid is propionic acid. The amounts of the medium chain diacid and short chain monoacid used in the polyamides of this invention are preferably chosen such that the ratio of equivalents of the medium chain diacid to the equivalents of the short chain monoacid ratio of about 1 1 to about 5 1, more preferably from about 2 1 to about 4 1, and most preferably about 3 1. The polyamides of this invention are prepared from mixtures that are substantially free of polymeric fat acids. These polymeric fat acids, which can be characterized as long chain polybasic acids, are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,776,865. These polymeric fat acids are derived by polymerizing either saturated or unsaturated fatty acids. It has been found that the amount of polymeric fat acid used in the polyamides of this invention should be minimized to obtain improved water solubility in the polyamide resin. The mixtures from which the resins of this invention are prepared are substantially free of polymeric fat acids, i.e. they may contain an amount of a polymeric fat acid equal to as much as 5 equivalent percent of the polyamide reaction mixture but preferably less than 5 equivalent percent and most preferably zero equivalent percent. The diamine used to form the polyamide resins of this invention is comprised of at least one aliphatic diamine having from 2 to 12 aliphatic carbon atoms. The preferred diamines can be divided into two preferred groups. One group consists of cyclic aliphatic diamines having from 8 12 aliphatic carbon atoms, e.g. isophorone diamine. The other preferred group Is comprised of short chain alkylene diamines which can be represented by the formula H2N R NH2 wherein R is an alkylene radical having from 2 to 8 carbon atoms. R may be branched or straight chained, the straight chain radicals being preferred. Specific examples of short chain alkylene diamines are ethylene diamine, diamino propane, diamino butane, and hexamethylene diamine. The resins are prepared from mixtures containing a dicarboxylic acid component and a diamine component by known methods for the polymerization of diacid and diamines to form polyamides. In general, a mixture of the diacid component and the diamine component is heated to a temperature between about 1000C and 2500C in a vessel equipped for the removal of the by product water formed in the polyamidification reaction e.g. a vessel fitted with a distillation column and condenser so as to remove water from the reaction zone. Typically the reaction mixture will be heated at lower temperatures initially to avoid any volatilization and loss of any short chain monoacid which may be employed, after which the temperature is raised to the higher reaction temperature. Thus, it is common to heat at about 1400C. for about 1 hour followed by raising the temperature to about 250 C and reacting for about 1.5 3 hours. Similarly, a portion of the charge of the medium chain diacid can be reserved from the initial charge of reactants. The initial reactant mixture can be initially reacted to ensure that substantially all of the short chain monoacid is incorporated into the resin. The reserved portion of medium chain diacid is then charged and the resulting mixture is allowed to react to obtain an acid terminated product. For example, from about 25 to about 50 of the medium chain diacid to be charged is reserved from the initial charge which is heated at about 140 C for one hour. The reserved portion of medium chain diacid is then added to the reaction mixture and the temperature is raised to about 2500C for about 1 l 2 to 3 hours to obtain a product having acid termination. The degree of polymerization of the mixture should be controlled, along with the choice of ratio of diamine to diacid, to obtain a polyamide having a high acid value. The acid value of the polyamide should be greater than about 10, more preferably greater than 20 and most preferably between about 30 and about 100. The polyamide resins of this invention form the binder compositions of this invention when dissolved in an aqueous solvent containing an organic amine. The resin is added to the solvent in an amount of about 30 to about 40 resin solids based on the weight of the solvent.Examples of suitable organic amines include primary, secondary and tertiary amines which can act as a base to salt the acid terminated polyamides. Particularly preferred organic amines are the dialkylaminoalkanols, such as 2 N,N dimethylamino ethanol and 2 N,N diethylamino ethanol. The organic amine is present in the aqueous solution in an amount sufficient to solubilize the chosen polyamide resin. In general, the organic amine will be present in the aqueous solution in an amount sufficient to theoretically neutralize the acid groups of the polyamide, i.e. the amount of organic amine is stoichiometrically equivalent to or greater than the acid value of the polyamide. For example, a 7.4 solution of dimethylaminoethanol is stoichiometrically equivalent to a polyamide resin having an acid value of about 70 used at the level of 40X resin solids. A large excess of organic amine should be avoided because retention of the organic amine in the cured binder may adversely affect the water retention of the binder. These binders are particularly useful in flexographic gravure ink compositions. The flexographic gravure ink compositions of this invention are preferably made by dispersing a flexographic gravure ink pigment in the binder compositions of this invention. It is an advantage of the present invention that less volatile organic solvent is needed to solubilize the resins in the binder compositions used to make flexograpric yravure ink coripositions of this invention than is needed to solubilize the dimer acid resins of U.S.Patent 3,776,865. Generally, the flexographic gravure ink compositions of this invention can contain less than about 25 by volume volatile organic solvent. The preferred resins can be used to prepare binders which contain even less volatile organic solvent, e.g. 5 to 20 , but which still yield flexographic gravure ink coatings having good water resistance.
