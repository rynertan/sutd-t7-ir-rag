# Method and apparatus for the production of liquid iron from iron oxide.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for producing liquid iron from iron oxide, wherein the iron oxide is substantially converted to sponge iron by passing reducing gas through it in a reduction column 1 and is then melted in a melt vessel 5 which is in open communication with the reduction column by heat generated by reaction of oxygen containing gas and carbonaceous material which reaction provides said reduc ing gas. To improve control of the process, the oxygen containing gas and the carbonaceous material are respec tively substantially pure oxygen and coal powder which are delivered separately, into the melt vessel, and the liquid iron bath 8 in the melt vessel is stirred so as at least partly to be kept in motion. By separate control of the oxygen and coal supplies, e.g. the level and or direction of delivery, and by control of stirring, it is possible to control the ratio of CO and COâ‚‚ in the reducing gas and also the heat output in the melt vessel.
