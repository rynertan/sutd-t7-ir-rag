## Description
TITLE Packaging BagsDESCRIPTION The invention relates to packaging bags, and more particularly, to packaging bags which have high stiffness and blocking resistance and are therefore suitable for automatic packaging.Heretofore, heavy duty bags for packaging granular materials such as rice and wheat, powdery materials such as fertilizer and feed, and angular solid materials such as fowl have been made of low density polyethylene.These heavy duty bags, however, are limited in their usefulness because of the low mechanical strength of low density polyethylene. In order to compensate for the poor mechanical strength, therefore, itis necessary to increase the film thickness Particularly, in the case of heavy duty bags, it is required for the film thickness to be markedly increased because of their seriously low tensile strength and stiffness. Furthermore, low density polyethylene is not suitable for use in the production of bags for automatic packaging because its stiffness is poor.In recent years, therefore,1 bags made of a laminated film comprising a high density polyethylene layer and a low density polyethylene layer have been proposed to overcome the above described problems of conventional bags see Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Nos 92023 81, 29426 82, and 30994 80 A bag prepared by using a film as disclosed in JapanesePatent Application Laid Open Nos. 92023 81 and 29426 82 is very preferred forpractical use because the seal strength and the film impact strength are high, the tear strength is well balanced, and furthermore, the outer layer is not slippery. However, when the bag is used to accommodate and convey angular heavy materials suSh as fowl, its film puncture strength, tear strength, impact resistance at low temperatures, and so forth become problems.Also, a bag made of a film as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 30994 83 suffers from disadvantages in that since the inner layer of the bag is made of low density polyethylene, blowing readily occurs and difficulties are encountered in opening the bag and, furthermore, it takes much labour and time to place materials in the bag because the inner surface is slippery.The invention provides a packaging bag comprising an outer layer and an inner layer, characterised in that the outer layer is a low density ethylene based polymer or a mixture thereof with an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, and the inner layer is a mixture of a high density polyethylene and an ethylene731 olefin copolymer.The outer layer of the bag of the invention is made of a low density ethylene based polymer hereinafter referred to as LDPE11 or a mixture of LDPE and an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer hereinafter referred to as EVA . Various types of LDPE can be used in the invention. Usually they have a density of from 0.91 to 0.94 gram per cubic centimeter g cm3 , preferably from 0.915 to 0.935 g cm3. Their melt indexes MI are within the range of from 0.3 to 10 grams per 10 minutes g 10 min , preferably from 0.3 to 4 g 10 min. When MI is more than 10 g 10 min, the impact resistance is lowered, unsuitably for practical use. On the other hand, when NI is less than 0.3 g 10 min, processability becomes low.The LDPE used includes that produced under high pressure and that produced under low pressure.Examples of such LDPE produced under low pressure include copolymers of ethylene anda olefins containing from 3 to 12 carbon atoms e.g. propylene, butene l, pentene l, hexene l, 4 methylpentene l and nonene l .The a olefin unit content of the copolymers is preferably from 1 to 10 by mole.When the outer layer of the present bag is made of a mixture of LDPE and EVA, the mixing ratio of LDPE to EVA is not critical. Usually, however, the ratio of LDPE EVA is from 10 90 to 95 5 by weight , with the range of from 60 40 to 90 10 by weight being preferred. If the proportion of EVA is excessively increased, various problems arise for example, a bag produced by using the resulting resin mixture has acetic acid odour and, furthermore, the surface of the bag excessively loses its smoothness. Such poor surface smoothness causes blocking between bags and makes bags stick to conveying equipments, e.g. a roller and the belt of a belt conveyor, as used in automatic packaging, resulting in a serious reduction in workability.The inner layer of the bag of the invention is made of a mixture of a high density polyethylene hereinafter referred togas HDPE and an ethylene a olefin copolymer. Various types of HDPE can be used in the invention.usually they have a density ranging between 0.94 and O.97 g cm3, with the range of from 0.945 to 0.965 gZcm3 being preferred. Their melt indexes are within the ranee of from 0.01 to 1 g 10 min, preferably from 0.02 to 0.2 g 10 min. When MI is more than 1 g 10 min, the mechanical strength, e.g. tensile strength, of the resulting film is undesirably lowered. Various ethylene a olefin copolymers can be used in admixture with HDPE. Preferred examples of a olefins which can be used in the preparation of the copolymers are those monomers containing from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, such as propylene, butene l, pentene l, hexene 1, 4 methylpentene 1, octene l, and nonene l.The a olefin unit content of the copolymer is suitably within the range of from 1 to 10 by mole.The above described ethylene olefin copolymer has a density of from 0.910 to 0.940 g cm3, preferably from 0.915 to 0.935 g cm3, and MI of from 0.3 to 10 g 10 min, preferably from 0.3 to 4 g 10 min. Of these ethylene a olefin copolymers, ethylene propylene based copolymer elastomers hereinafter referred to as EP are most suitable. Various types of EP can be used in the invention. Preferred examples of EP are ethylenepropylene rubber and ethylene propylene terpolymers containing, as a third component, dienes such as divinylbenzene, 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene, 1, 4 hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene, and cyclooctadiene. Those elastomers having a Mooney viscosity of from 40 to 150 are preferred.When the Mooney viscosity is less than 40, the mechanical strength of the resulting film is undesirably lowered.The ratio of HDPE to the ethylene a olefin copolymer is not critical and can be determined appropriately depending on the purpose for which the ultimate bag is used. Usually, however, the ratio of HDPE to the ethylene a olefin copolymer is from 95 5 to 50 50 by weight , with the range of from 90 10 to 60 40 by weight being preferred. When the proportibn of the ethylene a olefin copolymer is less than 58 by weight, the puncture strength and seal strength of the resulting film are reduced, and when a bag prepared by using the film is dropped, it is easily torn. On the other hand, when it is more than 50 by weight, processability becomes low, and a bag prepared by using the resulting film has poor stiffness and is not suitable for practical use. The bag of the invention comprises the above described outer and inner layers which are laminated on each other. Although the ratio of the thickness of the outer layer to the thickness of the inner layer can be determined depending on the purpose for which the bag is used, it is usually determined within the range of 1 99 to 60 40. When the thickness of the outer layer is more than 60 of the total thickness of the outer and inner layers, the tensile strength and stiffness of the bag are undesirably lowered On the other hand, when it is less than 1 , the processability thereof becomes difficult.The bag of the invention is usually of the two layer laminated structure consisting of an outer layer and an inner layer. If desired, a three layer laminated structure, including an intermediate layer between the outer and inner layers or having an innermost layer on the inner layer, can be used. The type of the intermediate layer being interposed between the outer and inner layers is not critical and can be determined appropriately depending on the purpose for which the bag is used. Although the type of the innermost layer is not critical as in the case with the intermediate layer, it is preferably made of an ethylene a olefin copolymer.Although the properties of the ethylene a olefin copolymer are not critical, the density is usually from 0.91 to 0.94 g cm3 and preferably from 0.915 to 0.935 3 g cm , and MS is from 0.1 to 20 g 10 min and preferably from 0.2 to 10 g 10 min. The a olefin content of the copolymer is usually within the range of from 1 to 108 by mole. The bag of the invention can be produced by various techniques For example, feed resin for the outer layer and feed resin for theinner layer are melted and kneaded at usual processing temperature in respective extruders and extruded therefrom, and then both of the resulting extruded resins are introduced into a circular die having double slit to form two layers which are bonded to each other inside the die. Thereafter, the inflation processing of the bonded two layers is performed at a blow ratio of from 2.5 to 8, preferably from 3 to 6, to obtain a tubular two layer film from which the bag of the present invention is produced. The outer layer and inner layer can be bonded together either outside or inside the die. It is preferred, however to bond together the layers inside the die since the bonding strength between the layers can be increased.In producing the bag of theinvention, if desired, additives such as pigment, a slip agent, an antioxidant, an antistatic agent and a weather resistance improving agent may be incorporated into any one or both of the inner and outer layers at any processing step.The bag of the invention having the above described structure is very superior in physical properties such as film puncture strength and tear strength to the conventional bags and, furthermore, its seal strength and impact resistance at low temperature are very high.Thus the bag of the invention can be used satisfactorily to accommodate therein and transfer heavy materials, particularly heavy angular materials such as foil. Moreover, the bag of the invention is reduced in blocking properties and has high stiffness and, therefore, it is suitable for use in automatic packaging and greatly accelerates packaging efficiency. Furthermore, since the mechanical strength of the bag is great, the thickness of the bag is sufficient to be about 10 to 200 microns and, therefore, a reduction in thickness can be achieved, which is economically advantageous.The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.In these Examples, physical tests were carried out according b the following methods.Impact Resistance Measured using a film impact tester manufactured by Toyo Seiki Seisakujo Co.

Then, inflation processing was performed at a blow ratio of 4.3 to obtain a tubular two layer film in which the ratio in thickness of the inner layer to the outer layer was 4 1 and the total thickness was 80 microns.
