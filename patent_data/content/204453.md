## Description
THERMOPLASTIC ELASTOMER COMPOSITIONS The present invention relates to thermoplastic elastomer compositions and in particular to thermoplastic elastomer compositions having low smoke and flame retardant properties. A thermoplastic is usually a linear or branched chain structure which softens and may flow at elevated temperatures. Examples are polyethylene, polystyrene and nylon. Thermoplastic elastomers can be processed and fabricated by methods used for thermoplastics. US Patent 3,265,765 to Holden et al, and the article by Hartman et al, Butyl Grafted to PolyethyleneYields Thermoplastic Elastomer , Rubber World, October 1970, pages 59 to 64 disclose thermplastic elastomers made by special block copolymerisation or polymer grafting methods. US Reissue Patent 31,518 to Fischer discloses thermoplastic elastomer compositions comprising a blend of a monoolefin copolymer rubber and a polyolefin resin. The blend of monoolefin copolymer rubber component and polyolefin resin is made through a dynamic partially coring process. US Patent 4,130,535 to Coran discloses a completely cured blend of olefin rubber and thermoplastic olefin resin. According to the present invention a thermoplastic elastomer composition comprising a partially cured blend of a rubber and a thermoplastic polyolefin resin is characterised in that the rubber is an acrylate rubber and in that the weight ratio of the acrylate rubber to polyolefin resin is from 95 5 to 50 50. The invention includes a method for preparing a thermoplastic elastomer comprising blending an acrylate rubber and a polyolefin resingin a weight ratio of from 95 5 to 50 50 and dynamically curing the blend by dynamically mixing the blend in the presence of an amount of curing agent which is less than the amount required to provide a fully cross linked composition. The invention also includes a low smoke and flame retardant thermoplastic elastomer composition comprising an acrylate rubber, a polyolefin resin and aluminium trihydrate, the weight ratio of acrylate rubber to polyolefin resin being from 95 5 to 50 50. In accordance with the present invention, a thermoplastic elastomer composition comprising an acrylate rubber and a polyolefin resin is provided by dynamically partially curing the blended components with a curing agent wherein the amount of curing agent is less than that required to provide a fully cross linked compo s ition. The curing agent is contacted with the blended components in amounts sufficient to assure the development of a thermoplastic elastomer which can be molded or otherwise shaped without the necessity for performing an expensive and time consuming vulcanisation step in the shaped particle. Moreover, the inventive composition can be reprocessed in a manner typical to thermoplastic materials. The rubber component of the inventive thermoplastic elastomer can comprise polyms of acrylate esters and copolymers of acrylate esters with ethylene. These polymers can also include a small amount of acrylic acid or other copolymerisable or terpolymerisable acid, to facilitate cross linking. US Patent 3,904,588 to Greene discloses the preparation of certain acrylate ester rubbers. The acrylate ester polymers and copolymers are commerically available under the Vamac DuPont , Cyanacryl American Cyanamid , and Rycar B.F. Goodrich trademarks. It has also been found that copolymers of ethylene propylene rubbers grafted with acrylic acid can also function as the rubber component. The ethylene acrylic elastomer is a copolymer of ethylene and methylacrylate plus a cure site monomer, with a structure as folios EMI3.1 ETHYLENE METHYL ACRYLATE CURE SITE MONOMER Polyacrylic rubbers of polyacrylate elastomers have two major components. A backbone component comprising 95 99Z of the polymer, and the reactive cure site component comprising 1 5 of the polymer. The copolymers have high molecular weight, typically about 100,000 Mn viscosity average molecular weight . The backbone component is made from monomeric acid esters of primarily two types 1 Alkyl and 2 AlkoxyEMI3.2 where n 2 ethyl acrylate where n 2 M 1 methoxy ethyl acrylate where n 4 s butyl acrylate where n 2 m 2 ethoxy ethyl acrylate The reactive cure sites are primarily of three types 1 reactive halogen 2 epoxy and 3 carboxylEMI3.3 X is a halogen, most commonly chlorine. for ekample, EMI4.1 2 chloroethyl vinyl ether allyl glycidyl ether acrylic acid Suitable polyolefin resins with which the acrylate rubber can be mixed to make the blend of the invention comprise crystalline solid high molecular weight resinous plastic material made by polymerising such olefins as ethylene, propylene, l butene, l pentene, 4 methylpentene, l hexene, 2 methyl l propene, 3 methyl l pentene, 5 methyl l hexene and mixtures thereof.Commercially available thermoplastic polyolefin resins, such as polyethylene or polypropylene can be used, including linear polyethylene. Polypropylene is the preferred polyolefin, having highly crystalline isotactic and syndiotactic forms. Crystalline block copolymers of ethylene and propylene, which are plastics distinguished from amorphous, random ethylene propylene elastomers, can also be used, preferably where the ethylene content does not exceed 20 . Included among the polyolefin resins are the higher alpha olefin modified polyethylenes and polypropylenes as disclosed in Polyolef ins , N.V. Boenig, Elsevier Publishing Company, NewYork, 1966 . The propylene polymers are commercially available under the trademark Pro fax from Himont, Inc. The molecular weight of these polymers as indicated by melt flow rate can vary from about 20 dg min. to 0.2 dg min. melt flow rate. The polypropylene component can also be optionally grafted with acrylic acid and is commercially available under the trademarkPolybond from BP Performance Polymers, Inc. Fillers such as aluminium trihydrate, hydrated magnesia, or hydrated calcium silicate can also be included in the elastomer compoiition. Other fillers which can be used comprise those commodly used in rubber and plastic compounding, such as clays, talcs, carbonates, carbon blacks, hydrates and oxides. Suitable candidates are listed in Rubber World Magazine Blue Book at pp.253 263 Lippincott Peto 1984 . The compositions according to the present invention can contain relatively high loadings of fillers and still maintain good physical properties. When aluminium trihydrate is used as the filler, the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention has a high limiting oxygen index LOI , and also burns with substantially no visible smoke. The combination of low smoke generation and resistance to burning are very desirable properties for many applications such as insulating cables with a low smoke and flame retardant jacketing, to be used in building construction and in military vehicles. The curing system used to accomplish the partial cross linking of the acrylate rubber polyolefin resin can comprise organic peroxides, sulphur, metal alkylates, epoxies, amines, azides, phenolic resin curing agents, metal oxides, quinone derivatives and the like. The particular type of curing agent used depends upon the specific cure site in the polymer and the properties desired in the finished product. Specific examples are disclosed in US Patent 3,284,421 to Breslow and 3,297,674 to Breslow et al. Other suitable curing agents are disclosed in the Encyclopedia of ChemicalTechnology, Volume 17, Second Edition, Interscience Publishers, 1968 , Science and Technology of Rubber, edited by F.R. Eirich,Chaperter 7, pp. 2891 335 Academic Press, 1978, , RubberTechnology, edited by Maurice Morto, Chapter 2, pp. 19 50 VanNostrand Reinhold, 2nd edition 1973 and Organic Peroxides , Volume 1, Daniel Severn, Wiley Interscience , 1970, and in US Reissue Patent31,518 to Fischer at column 3, line 26 to column 4, line 35, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. As already noted, the amount of elastomeric curing agent or the extent of cross linking imparted to the acrylate rubber portion of the blend is partial. In general, the amount of elastomeric curing agent used will depend upon the extent of thermoplasticity desired in the elastomer composition. The elastomeric curing agent can vary from about 1 90 , preferably about 5 75 and more preferably about 10 40Z of the amount necessary for a substantially complete cure or cross linking. The exact amount of elastomer curing agent is determined by the formulator taking into consideration such factors as the final method of fabricating the elastomer and the balance of properties desired for its end use. In using these limited amounts of curing agents or curatives, the mixing temperature of the blend containing the curing agent and the acrylate rubber polyolefin resin is selected so that whatever amount of curing agent is employed, it is substantially consumed during the reaction. As a practical rule of thumb, the effective activation temperature for the curing agent may be taken as the temperature at which at least 95 of the curative has been decomposed to yield free radicals within a 0.5 minute time period. It is preferable to select a curative having an activation temperature above the softening point or crystalline melting point of the polyolefin plastic. This temperature is about 1320C 270OF for high density polyethylene, and about 1680C 3350F for polypropylene. It is also possible to use a curing agent having an activation temperature at or below the softening point of the polyolefin resin. The activation temperature would ordinarily be above 116 CC 2400F , preferably aboutA320C 2700F . The maximum activation temperature would ordinarily not be more than 2320C 4500F , preferably not greater than 204 C 4000F . The data on the common peroxide curatives, such as 2, Sbis tert butylperoxy 2, Sdimethylhexane Peroxide I and dicumyl peroxide Peroxide II is given in the following table. Temp Half life in toluene C F Peroxide I Peroxide II 116 240 21 hours 10.2 hours 132 270 2 hours 1.75 hours 168 335 ca 5 minutes ca 3 minutes 182 360 47 seconds 22 seconds 199 390 7.2 seconds 3.6 seconds In contrast to the half life data tabulated above, at 182 C 360 F , the time to reach about 95Z decomposition for PeroxideI and Peroxide II is approximately 4 minutes and 1 1 2 minutes, respectively. The dynamic partial cross linking treatment substantially exhausts the action of the curing agent so that there is little or no tendency for further advancement of cure to take place subsequently. It is also desirable to further insure termination of the action of any remaining cross linking agent, by adding to the mix, at the end of the dynamic partial curing step, a small amount of a free radical scavenging agent, such as a stabiliser or antioxidant. Such stabiliser may be added and mixed in for the last minute or so of mastication. The dynamically partially cured material may be subjected to one or more ref ining passes on a mill, and the stabiliser antioxidant can be added in the course of or just prior to refining. A complete cure which would change the characteristics of the composition to one that is non thermoplastic, would defeat the purpose of the invention. The relative proportions of acrylate elastomer to polyolefin resin can vary over a wider range. The ratio of acrylate elastomer polyolefin resin can vary from about 95 5 to 50 50, respectively, in parts by weight. The proportion of filler, such as aluminium trihydrate can range from about 0 250 parts, preferably about 100 175 parts of filler per 100 parts of thermoplastic elastomer based upon the sum of the parts of the acrylate rubber and the polyolefin resin. pie elastomeric curing agent can be used alone or in combltation with suxiliary substances, such as accelerators, activators, stabilisers, free radical scavenging agents, chain extenders and antiorldants. Such materials, for example, include 2, 2 4 triuethyl l , 2 dihydroquinoline, diphenylamine acetone condensate, aldol alpha naphthylamine, octylated diphenylamine, N phenyl N cyclohexyl p phenylene diamine, 2,6 di tert butyl 4 methyl phenol, styrene resorcinol resin, o cresol monosulphide, di p cresol 2 propane, 2, 5 di tert amyl hydroquinone, dilauryl 3,3 thiodipropionate and similar dialkyl thiodipropionates. Other suitable additives are listed in Rubber Natural andSynthetic, Stern, Palmerton Publishing Company, New York, 1967 , especially at pages 244 256 and also Chemisty and Technology ofRubber , Davis and Blake Reinhold, New York, 1937 . The partial cure of the elastomeric blend of acrylate rubber and polyolefin resin is accomplished by contacting the blend with amounts of the curing or cross linking agent that are insufficient for a substantially cross linked cure. In addition to insuring that the amount of elastomeric curing or cross linking agent is less than the amount necessary to effect a full cure or cross linking, parameters such as the curing temperature, and time of cure are also carefully controlled to insure full activation of the curing agent s present in the blend. The curing temperature for the polyolefin acrylate rubber elastomer blend can vary from about 71 2040C 160 4000F , preferably 104 2040C 220 4000F , and most preferably 160 2040C 320 4000F . The curing temperatures are limited by the stability of the specific acrylate rubber that is used in the blend. For example, blends of the copolymers of methylacrylate and ethylene with polypropylene cannot be processed at temperatures above about 2040C 4000F or below about 1600C 3200F . At temperatures above 2040C 4000F , the acrylate degrades and gives off decomposition gases. At temperatures below about 1600C 3200F , the polypropylene cannot be processed because it is close to the melting point of the polymer. typical cure times can vary from about 1 to 30 minutes, preferably about 3 to 20 minutes, depending upon the cure system and temperature utilised. Naturally, the time required for the dynamic partial cure will vary with such parameters as the particular polymers employed in the blend, the kind and amount of curative, and the temperature at which the partial cure is carried out. To best accomplish the dynamic partial cure, the acrylate rubber, polyolefin resin, and cure system can be contacted on an open roll mill, or in an internal mixer such as a Banbury mixer, or an extruder mixer or a transfer mixer. The processability of the acrylate rubber polyolefin resin blend can be assessed for different applications by examining test specimens for a surface finish smoothness that is substantially free from obvious imperfections. A non thermoplastic material has an irregular grain and poor definition as well as lack of sharpness.Although these criteria are qualitative, those skilled in the art are readily able to ascertain satisfactory products from those that are unsatisfactory by visual examination and touch. The processability of the inventive blends can be evaluated by subjecting samples of the blend to such shaping operations as extrusion, injection molding, or compression molding. Extrusion is the shaping method of choice where long continuous forms, such as hose, window seals, wire coatings, flat sheets, and the like are desired. It is important that the extruded articles have acceptable surface smoothness. Extrudability can be evaluated in accordance with ASTM D 2230. For satisfactory injection molding, the acrylate rubber polyolefin resin elastomer material must form in the mold a homogeneous article of uniform strength. The flow viscosity characteristics of such elastomeric blends are adequate to insure filling the mold properly under the operating conditions. The elastomeric nature of objects shaped from the thermoplastic blend of the present invention can be demonstrated by a low elongation set at break, measured in accordance with ASTN standard D412. the thermoplastic nature of the inventive blends can be demonstrated by their reprocessability, especially after repeated extrusion with retention of desirable characteristics. In processing the inventive blend, it is advantageous to include a lubricant, particularly from the standpoint of improving the extrusion quality of the blend composition. For this purpose, any known lubricant conventionally used in rubber or plastics processing can be used, generally in amounts varying from about 0.2 to 3 parts by weight, preferably about 0.5 to 1 part by weight per 100 parts of the acrylate rubber polyolef in resin blend. In processing the acrylate rubber polyolef in resin blend, it has been found that the use of a three component stabiliser system is uniquely suitable in obtaining a desirable product. The first component of the stabiliser system comprises a high molecular weight multi functional sterically hindered phenol such as tetrakis methylene 3 3 ,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl proprionate ethane, more simply referred to as wtetrakis methane , available from Ciba Geigy Corp. under the trademark Irganox 1010. The high molecular weight multi functional sterically hindered phenol functions as an antioxidant and thermal stabiliser. The second component of the stabiliser system is an alkyl ester of a thiodipropionic acid such as dilauryl thiodipropionate DLTDP which functions as a secondary antioxidant. The third component osf the stabiliser system is a substituted benzotriazole, such as 2 3 5 di tert butyl 2 hydroxyphenyl 5 chlorobenzotriazole available under the trademarkTinuvin 327 from Ciba Geigy Corp. and functions in the stabiliser system to protect the elastomeric blend against ultraviolet radiation. The amount of stabiliser system can vary from about 0.5 parts by weight, and more preferably about 1 3 parts by weight of the thermoplastic composition. In the stabiliser system, the ratio ofDLTDP to substituted benzotriazole to hindered phenol can vary from about 2 4.5 0.75 1.25 0.75 f.25 and preferably about 4 1 1, respeNtively, in parts by weight. The elastomeric blend of the present invention can be manufactured in a single operation, or in a number of operational steps. In the single step operation, the acrylate rubber, polyolefin resin and curing agent, and if desired, the filler, are charged at the desired ratio to a suitable mixer such as a Banbury internal mixer, transfer type extruder mixer, extruder or any device that will enable efficient mastication of the blend at the desired temperature. The blending apparatus can be preheated to reduce the time necessary to reach the processing temperature range. The blend is then held at the processing temperature while continuing the mixing for a time sufficient to insure that effective partial cure of the blend has been accomplished.During processing, the stabiliser system is then contacted with the blend and processing is continued for a short time, usually for about 1 minute or more in order to thoroughly incorporate the stabiliser in the blend and for the purpose of deactivating any residual curing agent. In the multi step process, the acrylate rubber and curing agent are charged to a suitable apparatus wherein partial curing takes place. Thereafter, the partially cured acrylate rubber is blended with the polyolefin resin and other components, as needed. In the following examples, which serve to illustrate the present invention, all part and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.Examples 1 to 11 Various blends of ethylene methylacrylate elastomer EMA , aluminium trihydrate ATH , polypropylene PP , and an organic peroxide cure system were charged into a Farrel B size Banbury mixer and the ram was dropped. The component proportions for each example of blend are tabulated in Table 1. The Banbury mixer has no auxilliary cooling or heating and is operated in a neutral mode at a speed of 120 rpm, the speed being measured with no load on the mixer. When the batch temperature reached 1630C 3250F , the ram was rised and the stabiliser system was added. The ram was dropped again. At a batch temperature of 1820C 3600F the ram was again raised and the batch allowed to turn over for an additional 15 seconds.The batch was then recovered and samples prepared for physical testing were cut from a tape extruded from a laboratory size extruder. The extruder was set to attain a uniform temperature of 190 cm 3750F over its entire length. The tape die on the extruder was also set to a temperature of 190 0 3750F . The extruder was adjusted to operate at a screw speed of 75 rpm. Sample tapes of approximately 0.03 inch thickness were made and tested for tensile strength and elongation at break in accordance with ASTMD 412, limiting oxygen index LOI in accordance with ASTMD D 2863 and smoke generation by visual observation. Physical data for each example is tabulated in Table 2.
