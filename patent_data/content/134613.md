## Description
Perfume compositions and perfumed products which contain at least one or more esters of 2 ethyl 2 methyl butanoic acid as the perfume base. The invention relates to perfume composition which contain at least one or more esters of 2 ethyl2 methyl butanoic acid as the perfume base and to products perfumed with these compounds or with perfume compositions containing these compounds. There is continuing interest in the preparation and use of synthetic fragrances because these, in contrast to natural products, can at all times be prepared in an amount appropriate to demand, and in constant quality. It has now been found that esters of 2 ethyl 2methyl butanoic acid having the general formulaEMI1.1 wherein R represents an alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxyalkyl, cycloalkyl, alkylcycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl or aralkyl group having a maximum of 8 carbon atoms are valuable fragrancesThey are capable of imparting diverse desired odour notes to perfume compositions and products, namely odour notes of the green, fruity, minty, woody and floral type. The ethyl ester, in particular, is distinguished by a natural odour character. This ethyl ester has been described in British Patent Specification 1,004,286 and by J.R. Roland, J.D.C. Wilson and W.E. Hanford in J.Am.Chem. Soc. 72, 2122 24 1950 . However, in neither publication is there to be found any indication of the usefulness of this compound as a perfume base. As regards the upper limit of 8 carbon atoms, we record, for the sake of completeness, that the volatility and therefore the odour intensity of esters of 2 ethyl 2 methyl butanoic acid where R contains more than 8 carbon atoms is considered insufficient. The esters according to the invention sre pe pared in accordance with generally known esterification methods, for example by reaction of the corresponding alcohol with 2 ethyl 2 methyl butanoic acid or with a customary derivative thereof, such as the acid chloride. The esters according to the invention can be used successfully in perfume compositions or are used directly as odour imparting agents in a variety of products. By the expression perfume composition11, there is here meant a mixture of fragrance and,optionally, auxiliaries, if desired dissolved in a suitable solvent or mixed with a pulverulent substrate, which mixture is used in order to impart a desired odour to the skin and or to a variety of products. Examples of such products are soaps, detergents, air fresheners, room sprays, pomanders, candles and cosmetics, such as creams, ointments, toilet waters, pre shave and after shave lotions, talcum powders, haircare compositions, body deodorants and antiperspirants. Fragrancesand mixtures thereof which can be used, in combination with the compounds according to the invention, for the preparation of perfume compositions are, for example natural products such as ethereal oils, absolutes, resinoids, resins, concretes and the like, but also synthetic frsanaessuch as hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, ethers, acids, esters, acetals, ketals, nitrides and the like, these including saturated and unsaturated compounds and aliphatic, carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds.Examples of fragrances which can be used in combination with the compounds according to the invention are geraniol, geranyl acetate, linalool, tinalyl acetate, tetrahydrolinalool, citronellol, citronellyl acetate, dihydromyrcenol, dihydromyrcenyl acetate, tetrahydromyrcenol, terpineol, terpinyl acetate, nopol, nopyl acetate, 2 phenylethanol, 2 phenylethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl acetate, benzyl salicylate, styrallyl acetate, benzyl benzoate, amyl salicylate, dimethylbenzylcarbinol, tri ch loromethylphenylcarbinyl acetate, p tert. butyl cyclohexyt acetate, isononyl acetate, vetiveryl acetate, vetiveroL, alpha hexylcinnamaldehyde, 2 methyl 3 p tert. butylphenyl propanal, 2 methyl 3 p isopropylphenyl propanal, 3 p tert. butylphenyl propanal, tricyclodecenyl acetate, tricyclodecenyl pro pionate, 4 4 hydroxy 4 methylpentyl cyclohex 3 enecarbaldehyde, 4 4 methyl 3 pentenyl cyc lohex 3 ene carbaldehyde, 4 acetoxy 3 pentyl tetrahydropyran , 3carboxymethyl 2 pentylcyclopentane, 2 n heptylcyclopen t anone, 3 methyl 2 pentyl 2 cyclopentenone, n decanal, n dodecanal, dec 9 en 1 o I, phenoxyethyl i sobuty rate, phenylacetaldehyde dimethylacetal, phenylacetaldehyde diethylacetal, geranylnitrile, citronellylnitrile, cedryl acetate, 3 isocamphyl cyclohexanol, cedryl methyl ether, isolongifolanone, aubepinenitrile, aubepine, heliotropine, coumarin, eugenol, vanillin, diphenyl oxide, hydroxycitronellal, ionones, methylionones, isomethylionones, irones, cis hex 3 enol and esters thereof, indane musks, tetralin musks, isochromane musks, macrocyclic ketones, macrolactone musks, ethylene brassylate and aromatic nitro musks. Auxiliaries and solvents which can be used in perfume compositions which contain one or more compounds according to the invention are, for example ethanol, isopropanol, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethyl phthalate and the like. The quantities in which the compounds according to the invention can be used in perfume compositions or to perfume products can vary within wide limits and depend, inter alia, on the nature of the product wherein the fragrance is used, on the nature and amount of the other components in the perfume composition and on the desired odour effect. Hence, it is only possible to specify very rough limits, but these provide information sufficient for a man skilled in the art to be able independently to use the compounds according to the inventionIn most cases an amount of only 0.1X by weight in a perfume composition will already be sufficient to achieve a clearly perceptible odour effect. On the other hand it is possible, in order to achieve special odour effects, to use amounts of 20X by weight or even more in a com position.In products perfumed with the aid of perfumes compositions, these concentrations are correspondingly lower, depending on the quantity of perfume composition used in the product. The examples which follow serve solely to iliustrate the preparation and use of the compounds according to the invention, but the invention is not restricted thereto. Example IPreparation of ethyl 2 ethyl 2 methyl butyrate. 260 g of concentrated sulphuric acid are added in 15 minutes, with efficient stirring, to a mixture of 260 g 2 mol of 2 ethyl 2 methyl butanoic acid and 386 g 8 mol of ethanol. In the course thereof, the temperature rises to about 600C. The mixture is then heated for 3 hours under reflux, with stirring. When the mixture has cooled to room temperature, the layers are separated. The tower layer is diluted with 200 ml of water and then extracted with cyclohexane. The cyclohexane layer is combined with the original upper layer and the mixture washed neutral with sodium carbonate solution.The cyclohexane solution is then evaporated and the residue distilled under reduced pressure. 258 g of the desired ethyl ester are obtained, boiling point 650C 0.3 kPa n20 1.4110 NMR 100 MHz, S in ppm against TMS, solvent CC14 0.81 6H,t,J 7Hz 1.06 3H,s 1.24 3H,t,J 7 Hz 1.0 1.9 4H,m 4.08 2H,q,J 7Hz .
