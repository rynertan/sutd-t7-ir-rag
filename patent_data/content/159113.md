# Process and apparatus for growing single crystals of III V compound semiconductor.

## Abstract
A part of the melt surface 21 of a starting material is covered with an encapsulant 22 and the rest thereof 23 is directly in contact with the gas atmosphere in the vessel 1 , and for that purpose the apparatus comprises a means 20 for dividing the space in the crucible 4 into two parts, which consequently divides the melt 15 surface into two sections 21, 23 . In order to obtain the best quality single crystal 16 , of the III V compound semiconductor having a high dissocia tion pressure, by the use of a vertical puller, it is nessesary to enjoy the impurity capture effect of the encapsulant 22 and to equilibrate the vapour pressure of the group V element in the vessel 1 and the dissociation pressure of the melt during the growth procedure, these procedure being able to be accomplished by the use of the apparatus vertical puller comprising a means 20 for dividing the melt surface.
