# Crane operating aid.

## Abstract
A crane operating aid has one or more absolute en coding digital optical sensors 54 for monitoring linear or angular displacement between portions of the crane which are operatively moveable with respect to one another. Each sensor e.g. 54 comprises a detector made up of a light emitting element 568 which is spaced from a light receiving element 570 and an encoder disc 560 which is mounted for displacement with respect to the detector and operates to present a series of tracks 572 intermediate the light emitting portion 568 and light re ceiving portion 570 of the detector. Each track 572 comprises a series of alternatingly opaque and transparent portions 576, 574 . By moving the encoder disc 560 with respect to the detector, digitally encoded information is im parted to the detector representative of the displacement of the portions of the crane being monitored. Preferably, the digital output signals from a number of such sensors which monitor crane parameters such as boom lenght, boom angle, and slewing angle are fed together with si gnals representing boom reaction forces to a load moment computer which then calculates the percentage of load ca pacity as a function of the crane manufacturer s published load rating tables.
