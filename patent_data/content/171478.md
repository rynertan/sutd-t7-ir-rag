# Electrolyzing process and electrolytic cell employing fluidized bed.

## Abstract
An electrolytic cell of the type which includes a cylindric al electrolytic cell main body 1 divided into a main electrode chamber 35 and an auxiliary electrode chamber by a diaphragm 28 , and having main electrode particles 30 in the main electrode chamber, which are maintained in the fluidized state by an electrolyte supplied to the main electrode chamber an electrolyte supply port 2 and an electrolyte discharge port 31 are provided to enable flow of electrolyte through the cell to maintain the fluidized state of the particles, and a porous auxiliary electrode 26 is provided in contact with the diaphragm on the side thereof facing the auxiliary electrode chamber, to facilitate flow of gas generated on the auxiliary electrode in the direction of the auxiliary chamber.
