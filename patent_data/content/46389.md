# Infra red gas analyzer and cell for use therewith.

## Abstract
A non dispersive infrared gas analyzer, in which infrared energy is directed through a sample cell 11 , and is interrupt ed at a predetermined frequency. The infrared energy at least one preselected wavelength is detected to produce an AC sig nal having an amplitude proportional to the infrared energy passing through said sample cell and having a frequency corresponding to the predetermined frequency. The preselect ed wavelength corresponds to the characteristic absorption wavelength of a preselected gas. This AC signal is processed to produce a DC signal having an amplitude proportional to the concentration of the preselected gas in the mixture being ana lyzed. The signal processor includes an output amplifi er 15 , a voltage biasing network including a summing junc tion 21 connected to the input of the amplifier 15 , and a first variable control 17 manually adjustable to bring the current at the summing junction to zero in the presence of a non absorb ing gas in the sample cell. A second variable control 19 is connected in a feedback loop from the output of the amplifier to the input thereof for span calibration.
