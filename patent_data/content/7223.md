## Description
DESCRIPTION IMPROVEMENTS IN ORDER RELATING TO ROLIEP. BEARINGS . This invention concerns roller bearings and relates more particularly to such bearings including an outer race having one of its axial ends closed. For convenicnce, bearings including an outer race member having this characteristic will hereinafter be referred to as closed end bearings. An important example of the use of closed end bearings is in universal joints, wherein the sliding contact surfaces between a trunnion end face of the joint and the closed end wall of the outer race member of the co operating bearing require good lubrication because of the occasional thrust or pressure contact between them. Generally, the end face of the trunnion and the end wall surface of the outer race of the blaring effect oscillatory sliding rotation hereinafter simply referred to as oscillatory rotation while making pressure contact therebetween so that the formation of a lubricant film between the two surfaces is difficult.This leads to a problem in that friction and heat are created due to insufficient lubrication. In practice, the aforementioned contact surfaces have suffered from greater problems than might be apparent because they do not effect a surface contact but in most cases they effect localized contact, sometimes referred to as wedging due to the inclination of the trunnion and the yoke of the universal joint. is one way of meeting such problems, it has already been proposed, for example, to provide an oil groove in one or both of the mutually contacting surfaces, bt the simple provision of such an oil groove as a lubricant reservoir cannot result in a sufficient lubri ating performance and is not wholly effective in practice.It has also been proposed to provide one of the ontactLng members with circumferentially directed, convex ridge menxis but the relatively large surface contact area or areas presented by such ridge means appear to hinder the satisfactory introduction of oil between the contacting members during oscillatory motion. The present invention accordingly provides a closed end roller bearing including an outer race member comprising a cylindrical wall providing a raceway lor the bearing rollers, a centrally recessed end wall closing one axial end of said cylindrical wall and a circumferentially directed groove or recess between said cylindrical wall and said end wall, said groove and the recess in said end wall acting as lubricant reservoirs, characterised in that the portion of the end wall between the recess and the circumferentially directed groove is plane or flat and is provided intermediate the radially outer periphery of said recess and the radially inner periphery of said groove with a plurality of axially directed, upstanding convex portions of circular or elliptical or similar configuration, said convex portions being circularly spaced around said plane or flat portion, with the major axes of elliptical convex portions being directed radially of said end wall. When the bearing provided by the invention is used to support a trunnion of the cruciform member of a, universal Joint, lubricant stored in the central recess and in the circumferential groove of the end wall is distributed between the latter and the opposing end face of the trunnion as a result of the relative rotary oscillatory movement between the two, the distribution resulting from the interaction between the lubricant and the convex portions. The potential contact surfaces between the end wall and the trunnion end face are thereby maintained effectively lubricated at all times and possible damage due to friction and consequential heating is avoided, contributing to increased bearing life. Preferably, the axia i t si the con portion lies in the range 0.03 mm to 0.2 mm, which range haB been found effective to achieve satisfactory lubricant distribution when considered together with such other factors as lubricant viscosity and surface tension. Although circular or elliptical configurations are preferred for the convex portions, variations or derivations of these shapes may be employed if desired, for example to modify the distributive effect exerted on a lubricant. As an alternative to forming the convex portions on the end wall of the outer race member, they may be formed on a separate plate abutting that wall or they may be provided on the end face of the trunnion The invention will be described further, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is an axial section of a part of a universal Joint including a bearing embodying the invention Figure 2 is a transverse section of the outer race member of the bearing used in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a section taken on the line A A ofFigure 2 Figure 4 is a view corresponding to Figure 2 of a second embodiment of the outer race member Figure 5 is an axial section similar to that ofFigure 1 of another embodiment of the invention Figure 6 is a transverse section of the outer race member of the bearing shown in Figure 5 Figure 7 is a view corresponding to Figure 6 but showing an alternative outer race member Figures 8 and 9 are sections similar to that of Figure 3 of alternative convex portions, and Figure 10 is an elevation similar to that ofFigure 1 illustrating the invention embodied in a machined race bearing. The universal Joint shown in Fig.l includes a centre cruciform member of which one shaft or trunnion 2 is visible in.. the drawing and is supported in a yoke 7 by a roller bearing 3. The bearing 3 has an outer race 4 formed from thin metal sheet wherein are retained needle rollers 5 engaging the trunnion 2. A seal 6 positioned between the bearing 3 and the cruciform member of the universal Joint serves to seal the bearing and the trunnion 2 and to retain lubricant supplied to them during their initial assembly. Conveniently, the free end of the trunnion 2 is formed with an axially directed, blind bore 22 constituting a lubricant reservoir. As will be seen from Figs. 1 and 2, one axial end of the outer race 4 is closed by a bottom or end will 41 having a central recess 42. The end wall 41 is circuinscribed by a cylindrical side wall 43 and the interconnecting region or corner portion between the end wall 41 and the cylindrical side wall 43 is formed with a circumferentially continuous groove 44 acting as a further lubricant reservoir.The flat portion 45 between the outer peripheral edge of the recess 42 and the inner peripheral edge of the circumferential groove 44 the circular land left between the two is formed as a surface substantially perpendicular to the axis, and on the substantially central region thereof, there is formed a plurality of in the present embodiment, twelve pressed convex portions 46 which are equally circularly spaced as shown in Figure 2. As will be noted more particularly from Figure 3, the shape of the convex portions 46 when viewed in vertical or axial section is such as to impart a gentle curvature to their top surfaces. The convex portions 46 of the end wall 41 should advantageously be of as small a diameter as possible consistent with the ability to accept the expected range of thrust loads and, by virtue of the oscillatory motion of the outer race member, to urge lubricant between the bearing and the trunnion contact surfaces. However, the diameter of the convex portions 46 should not in general be much greater than the amplitude of the oscillations concerned on the circular circumference on which the convex portions are arrayed the amount of circumferential movement when the Joint effects circumferential oscillating movement within the range of oscillation angle thereof and if possible, should desirably be equal to or slightly smaller than that.However, in the embodiment actually shown in Fig.2, the diameter of the circular convex portions 46 is in fact slightly greater than the anticipated amplitude of oscillation both to facilitate formation of the convex portions 46 and to ensure that they are capable of accepting the expected thrust loads. The heights h Figure 3 of the convex portions 46 are substantially equal to each other and lie within the range of 0.03 m31 to 0.2 mm, dependent upon such parameters as the expected viscosity and surface tension of the lubricant to be used in the bearing. Too great a height h of the convex portions 46 would result in inferior performance in lubricant distribution and would hinder any machining that may be required during their formation and cpnversely, too small a height below the aforementioned minimum value would lead to the problem that when the trunnion 2 becomes inclined, the rim of the trunnion end face tends to bear against those areas of the flat portion 45 which have no convex portions 46, with the danger that the convex portions 46 then make no contact at all with the end face of the trunnion. Figure 4 shows an outer race member 4 which employs elliptical convex portions 46 instead of the circular convex portions shown in Figure 2, with the maJor axes of the elliptical convex portions being disposed radially. The surface configuration of tve latter convex portions is curved just like a portion of a Rugby football. In the universal joint shown in Figures 5 and 6, the flat portion 45 of the bottom or end wall 41 of the bearing race member 4 forms a ramp or axially inwardly inclined surface for positively preventing contact of the trunnion end edge with the flat portion.On top of the flat portion 45, as shown in Figure b, there are formed two rings of convex portions 46, 46 differing in diameter and these convex portions are arrayed in a circularly staggered relationship such that the convex portions in one ring are disposed between the convex portions in the other ring. Figure 7 shows an alternative arrangement in which two rings of circular convex portions of the same dimension are arrayed on the flat portion 45 substantially perpendicular to the. axis and these convex portions are disposed in a staggered relationship similar to that ofFigure 6. Alternative configurations of the convex portions 46 are shown in Figures 8 and 9, wherein Figure 8 illustrates a convex portion 46 of semi spherical shape and Figure 9 shows one of conical or pyramidal shape.Other shapes are, of course, possible, within the ccaditi as and parameters already described. In each of the above described embodiments, the convex portions are formed by special press working and therefore, the reverse side of the convex portions is formed as a flat surface but depending on the press working employed, said reverse side may be formed with complementary concavities. Also, in the illustrated embodiments so far described, reference has been made only to bearings having a shell type or pressed or drawn outer race, but the present invention is of course equally applxcäblb in all its aspects to a closed end solid type roller tearing h g an outer race formed as by machining from a solid woody. Such a bearing 103 is shown in Figure 10 incorporated in a universal joint 101 having a trunnion 102 supported in needle rollers 105 retained in a solid outer race 104 of the bearing. The outer race 104 is formed by machining from a solid body or by hot or cold forging operations.The outer race 104 is received in a yoke 107 of the universal joint and the trunnion is formed with an axial blind bore 121 acting as a lubricant reservoir. A closed end wall 141 of the outer race 104 has a recess 142 centrally thereof acting as a lubricant reservoir, and a cylindrical side wall 143 contiguous thereto, and the interconnecting or corner portion between the end wall 141 and the cylindrical side wall 143 is formed with a circumferentially continuous groove 144 constituting a second lubricant. On the substantially central circumference of the flat portion 145 between the outer peripheral edge of the recess 142 and the inner peripheral edge of the circumferential groove 144 the circular land left between the two, are formed a plurality of upstanding convex portions 146 formed as by a press operation, the number, size and shapes of the convex portions 146 being determined similarly to the convex portions 46 already described.
