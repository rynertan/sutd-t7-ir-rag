# Pressure time controlled unit injector.

## Abstract
The fuel injector 10 includes an electronically operated control valve 60 disposed between a supply passage and a timing chamber 80 to control the admission of fuel into and out of the timing chamber. A primary piston 62 and a secondary floating piston 72 are axially spaced within the central bore 70 of the injection body, and a normally closed injection nozzle 14 is situated at one end of the injector body. A mechanical linkage 30 associated with the cams haft of the engine drives the primary pumping piston 62 against the bias of a main spring 18 . The timing chamber 80 is defined between the pistons 62, 72 and a metering chamber 82 is defined between the secondary piston 72 and the nozzle 14 . An electronic control unit delivers a signal to the control valve 60 to close the valve and seal the timing chamber for a controlled period of time to form a hydraulic link so that the pistons 62, 72 move in concert during the injection and metering phases of the cycle of operation. When the signal from the ECU is terminated, the control valve opens, and breaks the link so that the primary piston 62 moves independently of the secondary piston 72 . The timing function is adjusted by the ECU relative to any preselected position of the crankshaft. The metering function is controlled by the pressure drop across a restric ting orifice 98 in the passageway feeding fuel to the metering chamber 82 .
