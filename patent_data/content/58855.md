# ELECTROLYTIC PRINTING METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
The recording medium 10 includes three distinct layers The surface layer 12 incorporates a leuco dye that is responsive to low voltage pulses of amplitude and duration that would be compatible with voltages used by modern integrated circuit chips. The middle layer is a conductive layer and the bottom or support layer is made from any suitable insulating material. The printing apparatus is supplied with write 18 and ground 20 electrodes of predetermined surface area that will contact the recording medium. The spacing or distance of the electrodes along the plane of the recording medium is also predetermined. By proper selection of the thickness of the surface layer 12 , the areas of the write and ground electrodes 18, 20 and their lateral spacing, low level electrolytic printing will be assured. A sufficient quantity of current is forced to flow into the surface and conductive layers beneath the write electrode means and thereby effects acceptable printing. Preferably, pulses of no more than 15 V amplitude will cause printing when at least 75 percent of the current delivered will be constrained to flow into the conductive layer 14 .
