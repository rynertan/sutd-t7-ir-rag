## Description
AN ELECTROCHROMIC DISPLAY DEVICE The present invention relates to an electrochromic display device and more particularly relates to a medium for use therein. Electrochromic display devices of several types are well known in the prior art. It is, however, believed that no prior art discloses the specific combination of ingredients for the medium used in the present invention. U.S. Patent 3,451,741 discloses an electrochromic process and a device for use therein. As may be seen from reading that patent, a reversible electrochromic display device may be made by confining a reactive medium between two electrically conductive electrodes, at least one of which is transparent. This medium comprises an oxidant reductant pair contained in solvent with a conductive salt. This patent gives many examples of suitable materials, but does not disclose the combination of ingredients which is the subject of the present invention. U.S. Patent 3,806,229 relates to the use of viologen materials in electrochromic display devices. This patent broadly describes the use of viologen reductants, and of N,N,N ,N tetramethyl p phenylenediamine as an oxidant. The patent also discloses the use of several solvents including acetone, acetonitrile, glutaridinitrile, benzonitrile, propylene carbonate, nitromethane and acetic acid anhydride. It has now been found that a reversible electrochromic display suitable for use over very long periods of time and having a very high electrochromic efficiency may be prepared using a certain specific combination of ingredients in the medium. This combination of ingredients consists essentially of methyl ethyl ketone as the solvent, N,N,N ,N tetramethyl p phenylenediamine as the oxidant, heptyl viologen tetrafluoroborate as the reductant and tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate as the conductive salt. When all of these particular ingredients are used in combination, the resulting electrochromic display has cycle times considerably longer than any previously described. The concentrations of the oxidant N,N,N ,N tetramethyl p phenylenediamine and the reductant heptyl viologen tetrafluoroborate should be approximately equal to each other on a molar basis. At least about 0.01 moles per litre for each should be used. Saturated solutions of the ingredients may be used. It is possible to use a medium in which undissolved solid material remains. In general, however, it is preferred that the concentrations of both the oxidant and reductant be in the range of about 0.2 to about 0.4 moles per litre.The mixture should be anhydrous. An electrochromic display medium consisting essentially of the following formulation was prepared. 0.2 moles per litre N,N,N ,N tetramethyl p phenylene diamine, 0.2 moles per litre heptyl viologen tetrafluoroborate, 0.4 moles per litre tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate. The solvent was anhydrous methyl ethyl ketone. The medium was placed between two electrically conductive electrodes, one of which was transparent.Using matrix addressing, the medium was employed in a four character display panel with a reservoir of solution behind the cell. The formulation was cycled for more than 1500 hours without measurable degradation. At the end of the 1500 hours, the test was stopped because the equipment was needed for other experiments. In like manner, a formulation was made consisting essentially of 0.4 moles per litre of N,N,N ,N tetramethyl p phenylenediamine, 0.4 moles per litre of heptyl viologen tetrafluoroborate and 0.4 moles per litre of tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate with anhydrous methyl ethyl ketone as the solvent. This medium was cycled in a four character panel without a reservoir for more than 150 hours without any observable change in electro optical properties. The medium of the present invention is capable of repeated use for hundreds or even thousands of hours.In addition, the medium possesses a high electrochromic efficiency and is colourless in the OFF state.
