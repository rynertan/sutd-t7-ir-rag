# A process for complete or selective removal of salts from aqueous solution.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the selective removal of salts from aqueous solution by the use of polyethers. Polyethers complex with cations so that some normally water soluble salts may be rendered soluble in organic solvents. Where the anion is hydrophilic this is not possible. This applies to common inorganic anions. Accordingly the polyether is adsorbed on carbon and the salts form a complex with the polyether. The polyether may be eluted from the caron with an organic solvent. The salt may then be eluted from the carbon using water. Different salts are adsorbed to different degrees and can be selectively separated. Preferred polyethers are cyclic oligomers of ethylene oxide. The invention is particularly useful for the removal of chlorides and nitrates from aqueous solutions.
