The novel compounds demonstrate the dopaminergic activity of antiparkinson and antihypertensive agents. Some of the novel compounds are also a2 adrenergic receptor antagonists and hence antidepressant. It is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide novel compounds of formula I novel processes for their preparation novel pharmaceutical formulations comprising one or more of the novel compounds as active ingredient and novel methods of treating Parkinsonism, hypertension and depression by administration of a novel compound to a patient in need of such treatment.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The novel compounds of this invention have general structural formula I which is used herein to represent the trans isomers only.EMI2.2 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, whereinR is a hydrogen b C1 4 alkyl either branched or straight chain, especially ethyl or propyl c C25 alkenyl, especially allyl or d phenyl C1 4 alkyl especially benzyl andR1, R2, R3 and R4 are independently selected from a hydrogen, b C1 4 alkyl, especially methyl, c halo, such as fluoro, chloro or bromo, d OR6 wherein R6 is 1 hydrogen 2 C1 3 alkyl, especially methyl, 3 phenyl C1 3 alkyl, especially benzyl,EMI3.1 wherein R7 is i C16 alkyl, either straight or branched chain, such as methyl, t butyl, or the like, ii C36 cycloalkyl, such as cyclopropyl, cyclohexyl or the like, iii benzenoid aryl C1 3 alkyl, especially phenyl C1 3 alkyl wherein the aryl group is unsubstituted or substituted with one or more groups such as halo, C1 3 alkyl, or C1 3 alkoxy, iv heteroaryl Cl 3alkyl, such as pyridyl or furyl C1 3 alkyl, v benzenoid aryl especially phenyl, either unsubstituted or substituted with one or more groups such as halo, C1 3 alkyl, or C13 alkoxy, vi heteroaryl such as pyridyl or furyl, and vii NR8R9, wherein R8 and R9 are independently hydrogen or C13 alkyl, or R8 and R may be joined together to form a hetero cycle with the nitrogen to which they are attached such as piperidinyl, morpholinyl, piperazinyl, or N C13alkyl piperazinyl, andR5 is hydrogen, C1 3 alkyl or phenyl. A preferred embodiment is that wherein R is C14 alkyl especially ethyl or n propyl, and one or more of R1, R2, R3 and R4 is hydroxy, methoxy, acetoxy or pivaloyloxy especially in the 9 position. The novel compounds of this invention have two asymmetric carbon atoms, 4a and la, where the morpholino ring is fused to the tetrahydronaphthalene ring. This invention includes stereoisomers in which these asymmetric centers are in a trans conformation. The invention further includes the individual enantiomers and mixtures thereof including the racemate. Both enantiomers and mixtures thereof have dopaminergic activity, but the trans compound is much preferred for that utility. On the other hand, the trans enantiomer is preferred for a2 adrenergic receptor blockade. The pure optical antipodes can be prepared from the appropriate optically pure intermediates or by resolution of the final racemic product. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the novel compound of this invention are acid addition salts formed from a novel compound and an organic or inorganic acid recognized by the art as providing a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, dihydrogen phosphate, sulfate, citrate, pamoate, pyruvate, napsylate, isethionate, maleate, fumarate, or the like. These salts are readily prepared by mixing solutions of equimolecular amounts of the free base compound and the desired acid in suitable solvents such as water, alcohols, ether or chloroform, followed by recovery of the product by collecting the precipitated salt or evaporation of the solvent. A novel process for preparing the novel compounds is another embodiment of this invention and is represented as follows EMI6.1 The novel process comprises the reduction of the oxazinone, II, with a complex metal hydride such as lithium aluminum hydride in an inert organic solvent such as an ether, for example, tetrahydrofuran, l,2 dimethoxyethane, tetrahydropyran, or the like at a temperature between about OOC and 1000C.Operating procedures normally involve slow addition of the cyclic amide to the reducing agent at room temperature or below, followed by heating to an elevated temperature within the stated range, preferably, the reflux temperature of the solvent, for about 1 2 to about 8 hours usually about 4 hours. If, in the novel process of this invention, the nitrogen substituent, R, is hydrogen, and it is desired that it be one of the other substituents within the definition of R the product from the foregoing reaction may be treated with the appropriate alkylating agent of formula R X wherein R is as defined earlier and X is a suitable leaving group such as iodo, bromo, chloro, mesylate, tosylate, or the like. The alkylation is conducted in an organic solvent such as DMF, DMSO, or THI , preferably DMF, at about 10 to about 1000C until the reaction is substantially complete usually about 3 to 10 hours. If one or more of R1, R3 or R4 is alkoxy, it or they may be converted to hydroxy, if desired, by heating at about 150 2500C in excess pyridine hydrochloride for about 3 to 8 hours.Alternatively, the deetherification can be accomplished by treatment with boron tribromide BBr3 or aluminum chloride AlCl3 in an inert organic solvent such as petroleum ether, or hexane, or a chlorinated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride, tetrachloroethane or the like, between room temperature and reflux temperature for 3 to about 8 hours. Also, if R1, R2, R3 or R4 is benzyloxy or substituted benzyloxy it or they can be converted to hydroxy by hydrogenolysis with a noble metal catalyst such as palladium, platinum, or platinum oxide, with or without a carrier such as carbon, or the like, preferably palladium on carbon, in an inert organic solvent such as C13 alkanol, an ethereal solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, 1,2 dimethoxyethane, or the like, or mixtures thereof. The reaction is conducted at or near room temperature such as 15 300C until hydrogen uptake ceases or the requisite amount of hydrogen is consumed. In those compounds wherein R1, R2, R3 or R4is EMI8.1 they are prepared by treatment of the corresponding hydroxy compound with the appropriate acid anhydrideEMI8.2 acid chlorideEMI8.3 or the like.in the presence of an acylation catalyst such as pyridine, 4 dimethylaminopyridine or 4 pyrolidinopyridine. Temperatures from about 150C to 1000C are used until the reaction is substantially complete. A third embodiment of this invention is a pharmaceutical formulation comprising one of the novel compounds as active ingredient. It may be in any art recognized form suitable for oral use, such as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders, or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, syrups, or elixirs. For intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous use the pharmaceutical compositions may be in any art recognized form of a sterile injectable preparation such as a sterile aqueous or oleaginous solution or suspension. The amount of active ingredient incorporated in a unit dosage of the above described pharmaceutical compositions may be from 1 to 400 mg, and preferably from 5 to 250 mg. Other embodiments of this invention are the treatment of hypertension and or parkinsonism with a compound of Formula I with zero or positive optical activity. The route of administration can be oral, rectal, intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous. Doses of 0.1 to 20 mg kg day and preferably of 0.5 to 10 mg kg day of active ingredient are generally adequate, and if preferred it can be administered in divided doses given two to four times daily. In the treatment of Parkinsonism, this invention also includes the coadministration of a compound of Formula I with zero or positive optical rotation with an art recognized antiparkinsonism agent such as SINEME Merck Co., Inc., Rahway, N.J. , each agent being administered in a dose comparable to that recommended for use as though it were the sole therapeutic agent. The coadministration is accomplished either by administration of the two agents separately at approximately the same time or by administration of a single unit dosage form comprising the combined agents such as 10 mg of a compound of Formula I with zero or positive optical rotation 100 mg of l dopa and 10 mg of carbidopa.The coadministration is particularly useful when, as frequently happens, parkinsonism symptoms break through despite a history of successful treatment with SINEME z or other art recognized antiparkinsonism agent. A further method of treatment, comprising another embodiment of this invention, is the treatment of depression with a compound of Formula I with zero or negative optical activity. Doses and modes of administration comparable to those described above are satisfactory for this novel method of treatment. It is to be noted that the precise unit dosage form and dosage level depend upon the requirements of the individual being treated, and consequently are left to the discretion of the therapist.
