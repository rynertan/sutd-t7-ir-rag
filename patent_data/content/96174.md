# BIASED POWER TRANSISTOR DRIVING CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A circuit for driving a power transistor that forms part of an inverter circuit used in motor control in which the circuit is switched at high voltages. The motor drive circuit isolates and amplifies a control signal so as to operate the power switching transistors. The base drive circuit employs two characteristics of power transitors to derive maximum protection and maximum performance simultaneously. This control is accomplished by sensing both the collector to emitter voltage of the power transistor as well as the base to emitter voltage thereof. In an alternate embodiment described herein, a feedback circuit is also provided sensitive to collector to emitter voltage for shortening the try time associated with the power transistor.
