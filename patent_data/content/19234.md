# Semiconductor integrated circuit structure.

## Abstract
A GaAs semiconductor integrated chip has circuit components 9, 10 , an input photoelectric converter 4 providing input signals to said circuit components, and an output electrooptic converter 3 providing output signals from said circuit components. Optical fibres 6, 5 communicate the signals to and from the structure. An optical fibre 7 couples an electrooptic converter 18 and a photoelectric converter 13 to provide an on chip cross over relative to an electrode 16 .
