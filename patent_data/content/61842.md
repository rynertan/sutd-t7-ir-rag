# Directional valve with spool transfer loop.

## Abstract
A solenoid operated directional valve 10 that has cushioning chambers 48 and 50 into which the attenuation elements 52 and 54 on the ends of the spool 38 are received for cushioning the movement of the spool, and a transfer loop 56 through which fluid can travel during the cushioning operation, characterized in that the attenuation elements are constructed and arranged so that they will function to purge air or other gaseous fluids from the cushioning chambers and the transfer loop as an incident to reciprocal movement of the spool.
