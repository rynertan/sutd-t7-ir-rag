# Control valve.

## Abstract
A control valve comprises a valve body 10 defining a multistep bore 36 , and a valve member 44 engageable with a coaxial valve seat 46 , both supported for reciprocating mo lion within the bore 36 and cooperating to control the fluid communication between first and second ports 30, 32 de fined in the valve body 10 . A primary biasing spring 48 en closed within a vented spring chamber 52 urges the valve member 44 into engagement with the valve seat 46 . The valve member 44 is a unitary element including first and sec ond annuli 44a, 44b joined by a reduced diameter shank por tion 44c . A radial surface on the first annuli 44a defines a net effective pressure area against which fluid pressure at the port 30 is applied. An end surface 92 formed on the second an nulus 44b defines an effective pressure area against which pi lot pressure can be applied to further oppose the primary spring force.
