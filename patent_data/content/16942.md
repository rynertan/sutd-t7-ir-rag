# Winding machine.

## Abstract
A filament winder is adapted to enable it to produce acceptable packages of filament despite variation in tension of filament 10 fed thereto. The adaption involves tension control by controllably varying the contact length of the filament with a body preferably roller 14 to vary the dynamic friction exerted on the filament. A roller for con trolling filament tension during package formation is also described.
