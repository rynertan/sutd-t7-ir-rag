# Optical alignment means.

## Abstract
A method of aligning an optical fibre with a light source 12 , such as a solid state laser, comprises substantially aligning the axis of optical fibre 10 with the light source 12 and locating two lenses 14 and 16 between the fibre 10 and the source 12 . One of the lenses is fixed and the other is movable in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the fibre 10 . The lens 14 is moved until the image of the light source 12 is focussed on to the end of the fibre 10 , the fibre also being axially movable. The method can be termed an optical lever , move ment of the lens causing a smaller movement of the image. The requirement for fixing the fibre or the lens extremely accurately is therefore reduced.
