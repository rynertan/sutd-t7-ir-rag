# Clamp up device for roll neck bearings.

## Abstract
A bearing C for a mill roll A is forced to and held in the proper position on the neck 4 of the roll by a clamp up device D that fits around the roll neck 4 between the bearing and a conventional split hinged ring 24 which serves as a backing for the device. The clamp up device includes inner and outer rings 42, 44 which together form an annular fluid chamber, and when this chamber is pressurized, the outer ring extends, forcing the bearing to its proper position on the roll neck. Within the annular fluid chamber, each ring is provided with ramps which align and come against each other when the outer ring is turned to the proper angular relationship with respect to the inner ring, and when the outer ring is so disposed it will remain axially extended to hold the bearing in its proper position on the roll neck during operation of the mill roll. A locking plate 46 is provided to lock the rings 42, 44 against rotation relative to each other once they are in the proper angular relation. The clamp up device is particularly useful in con nection with bearings designed to fit tightly over tapered roll necks.
