# Process for oxidising a metal sample.

## Abstract
A surface reaction process for controlled oxide growth is disclosed using a directed, low energy ion beam for oxide formation. In particular Ni oxide Ni and Cr oxide Ni tunnell ing junctions are fabricated using broad directed beams of oxygen ions with energies ranging from 30 to 180 eV and a background pressure of 0.3 mTorr or less. Junction resist ance decreases with increasing ion energy, and oxidation time dependence shows a characteristic saturation, both consistent with a process of simultaneous oxidation and sputter etching.
