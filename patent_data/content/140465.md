# Defined coverage loudspeaker horn.

## Abstract
Opposed side walls 16, 18 20 of a loudspeaker horn 12 are constructed to direct portions of a sound beam toward a target over different preselected included angles, producing an incident beam which is substantially coexten sive with the target. The side walls 16, 18 20 preferably extend downstream at the preselected angles over a distance at least comparable to a maximum wavelength at which the horn is to be used.
