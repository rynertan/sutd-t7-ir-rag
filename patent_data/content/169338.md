# ON THE FLY DATA COMPRESSION SYSTEM

## Abstract
An on the fly data compression system for compressing the data transmitted between a data source 10 and an ultimate utilization device 22 . The system normally has two data compression modules 12 14 implementing a conven tional multi buffering scheme and a decoder 18 for recon structing the compressed data to its original format. The data compression modules 12, 14 compress the data using a word representation by associate processing buffer and a content induced transaction overlap transmission protocol which results in an interleaved transmission of data bits and bit position bits, the latter being indicative of the number of data bits that will be transmitted during the subsequent data transmission. The decoder 18 reconstructs the compressed data to its original format in response to the transmitted data and bit position bits and stores them in a buffer 20 in the sequential order in which they were generated.
