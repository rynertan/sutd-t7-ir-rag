## Description
r The present invention relates to an axle suspension which is particularly though net exclusively suitable for use with air suspension units in commercial vehicles. it is not convenient for air suspension units to act directly onto axles as is conventional wiLh leaf springs. A more convenient arrangement, which has been employed, is to attach the axle rigidly to trailing arms which are pivoted to the vehicle in front of the axle and which transmit axle ioad to air suspension units behind the axle. This arrangement on its own suffers from the drawback that under vehicle rol conditions, when one trailing arm is inclined upwardly in comparison with rlowusal, and the other trailing arm is inolined downwardly in comparison ltil normal, the axle casing is twised nd indeed acts as an anti roll bar.This has led to cranking of axle casings and suspension members. The present invention seeks to obviate this problem. According to the invention there is provided an axle suspension comprising a pair of longitudinal arms, each pivotally connectable at one end to the vehicle a pair of axle mounting brackets resilient connection means resiliently connecting each axle mounting bracket to its own longitudinal arm a cross beam interconnecting the other ends of the longitudinal arms a pair of suspension units, each acting di ectly or indirectly on its own longi t dinal arm for transmitting axle loads to the vchicle and meauf for later lly locating the arms and cross beam with respect to the vehicle. Whilst it is envisaged that the arms 1xav be leading aries, it is preferred that they be trailing arms. The pivotal connection of each ann may be by means of a plain bearing or a rubber bush. The resilient connection of the axle brackets accommodates differing arm inclinations experienced under roll conditions withour appreciably twisting the axle.The resilient connection must also constrain within limits rotation of the axle with respect to the arms under acceleration and more importantly braking. This is preferably achieved by pivotally connecting the brackets to their arms and providing separate torque reaction means to restrict the amount of pivotal movement allowed due to wheel torques under braking and or acceleration. In a preferred embodiment the torque reaction means is for each bracket a quarter elliptic spring bolted to the bracket at one end and pinned to the arm concerned at the other end. The quarter elliptic spring may extend forwards or backwards along its arm from the bracket to the paning position. Alternatively a rigid lever might be used in an analogous position with a torque reacting spring disposed between the free end of the lever and the arm.Again the spring, or the lever, might extend in both directions along the arm and be pinned, or spring connected, to the arm on opposite ss of the bracket. For each trailing arm, another alternative torque reaction means might be a strut acting along the arm between it and the axle above or below the pivotal connection of thc bracket concerned with a buffer at either or DO ends of the strut. Pivotal connection of the brackets to the arms may be by plain bearings or rubber bushes to provide enhanced noise isolation. rurther it is envisaged that a single rubber mounting could constitute both the torque reaction means and the separate pivotal connection. The arms are preferably flexibly connected to the cross beam either by plain bearings or rubber bushes the latter or at least resilient couplings are preferred to accommodate change in arm angularity during vehicle rol Nevertheless in a case where increased roll stiffness is required a stiff connection may be used e.g. the cross bcam may be twin pinned or rigidly joined to the trailing anns to cause the cross beam to act as an anti roll bar. The suspension units may be steel coils or rubber units but the preferred suspension units are air suspension units. The suspension units may act directly onto the longitudinal arms or onto the cross beam, which transfers the loads onto the arms. Preferably the units act at the ends of the cross beam since the further they are spaced laterally in the vehicle the greater roll stiffness they provide. Air suspension units normally operate at a leverage decreasing their loading from the equivalent wheel load. In the preferred embodiment, including trailing arms, the units are conveniently positioned behind and in line with the wheels of the axle concerned. In this position they may be arranged at an adequate leverage and they may produce a suitable roll stiffness. The means for laterally locating the axle conveniently acts through the cross beam, though it could act directly cn the axle. The location mars trav be Panhard rod, though other conventional locating means might be employed such as a Watts linkage or an A frame. Further, sliding pads acting between the trailing arms end the vehicle chassis may also be used. These may take the form low friction pads, e.g. of nylon, carried on the arms to slide against steel plates attached to the chassis. The axle may be either a front or a rear axle and may be either driven or dead. To help understanding of the invention, a specific embodiment thereof will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a front perspective view of an axle suspension according to the invention installed on a vehicle chassis, Figure 2 is a rear perspective view of the suspension with the chassis omitted, and Figure 3 is a diagrammatic side view showing trailing arms in a roll condition. Referring first to Figure 1, there can be see in outlinc a rear portion of a commercial vehicle chassis 1 having rear nearside wheels 2 on axle 3. In front of the axle, a bracket 4 is attached to the outside of the chassis for pivoting a trailing arm 5 via a cylindrical rubber bush 6, the trailing arm being disposed outboard of the chassis. A mounting bracket 7 connects the axle 3 to the trailing arm via a spherical rubber bush 8 and a torque reaction quarter elliptic spring 9. The bush 8 is mounted within the arm 5 which is of fabricated construction. The spring 9 is pinned at its forward end 10 to lugs ii on the arm and is clamped at its rear end to tie bracket 7 by axle clamp bolts 12. As may be appreciated from Figure 2 there are offside and ncarside trailing arms 5. Since they are similar they are not separately described. A cross beam 13 interconueccs the rear ends of the trailing arms to which it is interconnected by non sho in cylirc ical bushes contained within the charnel of the bean on bolts 14. Outboard ends of the beam have mounting pads 15 for air suspension units 16 which are housed at their upper ends in housings 17 attached to the chassis.These units act at a mechanical advantage with respect to loads transferred from the axle via the brackets 7, the arms 5 being pivoted at the brackets 4. The unit arc spaced outwardly from the chassis to be in line with and be hind the wheels. Thus they act to provide greater roll stiff ness than they should if they acted at the rear ends of the trailing arms. Figure 3 shows in diagrammatic form a nearside trailing am 5 and in dotted lines an offside trailing arm 5 under a vehicle roll condition to the offside. Tlle offside quarter elliptic spring 9 can be seen to be arched whilst the nearside spring 9 is flattened. The torque required for deflecting these springs is still transferred through the axle 3. However, in contrast to the above described prior arrangement, the axle is not required to twist through the angle alpha separating the arms to permit the degree of roll indicated. In effect the springs 9 are contributing to the roll stiffness of the supension system.It is an advantage of this suspension system that its overall roll stiffness may be arranged to be the same as that of a conven tional leaf spring system which it may replace acting at the position of the brackets 7. At the sare time the air suspension units give a softer spring rate in bounce. The springs 9 do not of course deflect under vehicle bounce, but they do react axle braking and acceleration torques. Referring again to Figure 2 a Panhard ro2d 18 extends between a chassis bracket 19 in the vicinitr of the offside housing 17 and a bracket 20 at the nearside end of the cross beam 13. The Panhard rod locates the axle 3 later ally in the chassis. The invention is not intended to be restricted to the details of the above described embodiment. Fo instance each leaf spring flay trail from its axle mounting bracket.With this arrangement, the inside one of the pair of lugs to which the rear end of the spring is pinned provides a convenient mounting point for a nylon pad which slides against a steel plate attached to the chassis. The pair of pads, one on each arm and side of the chassis, thereby locate the arms laterally of the vehicle and replace the Panhard rod
