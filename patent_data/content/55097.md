## Description
RADIO TELEPHONE SYSTEM This invention relates in general to radiotelephone systems whereby a mobile radio telephone user is placed in communication with a telephone subscriber. Communication is established through a central terminal which transmits to a mobile user via one of a plurality of dedicated radio communication channels, voice communication received from a telephone subscriber over a telephone line.The central terminal also receives via radio channel voice communication from the mobile user and relays it to the telephone line for transmittal to the telephone subscriber. A basic radio telephone scheme is set forth in detail in U.S. Patent 3,173,996 Rypinski, Jr., issued March 16, 1965. The teachings of that patent are incorporated herein by reference. The basic radio telephone system set forth in the Rypinski, Jr. patent utilizes eight separate and distinct dedicated communication channels for transmitting and receiving information to and from mobile radio telephone users. Thus, it is capable of simultaneously handling eight telephone conversations between mobile radio telephone users and their respective telephone subscribers. Thus, when there are more than eight mobile radio telephone users, they must share the eight available channels.When eight mobile radio telephone users are in simultaneous communication over the eight available channels, a ninth mobile radio telephone user will not have a free channel available for a call and must wait for a communication channel to become free. Therefore, a system for signaling the busy and free status of the eight dedicated communication channels was necessary. An arrangement and method of operation were adopted allowing a plurality of mobile radio telephone stations to automatically select a non busy communication channel for initiating or receiving a telephone call. In accordance with the method adopted, a marker is transmitted on a free communication channel in order to designate it as the next communication channel that is available for communication. A land based terminal includes means for identifying a particular one of the communication channels as the next available channel and transmitting a marker signal thereon to designate it as such. Each of the mobile radio telephone stations includes a channel selector which sequentially scans the channels in search of the marker signal. The channel selector within the mobile radio telephone stops scanning when it detects the marker signal and camps on the identified channel. When a telephone call is originated by a telephone subscriber intended for a particular mobile radio telephone, the address of the call receiving mobile radio telephone is transmitted on the marked channel. A telephone conversation will then take place between the telephone subscriber initiating the call and the mobile radio telephone receiving the call.The terminal then marks a new next available channel and transmits a marker signal thereon to designate that channel as the one next available for communication. The mobile radiotelephones, not engaged in communication, again search for the next available channel by scanning all of the channels until the marker signal is detected. Upon detecting the marker signal, the mobile radiotelephones stop scanning and camp on the newly marked channel. This marking arrangement also works for calls originated by a mobile radio telephone. All mobile radio telephones, not otherwise engaged in communication, are camped on the next available channel for communication. When one of them wants to initiate a call, it transmits the appropriate call initiating signal on the marked channel and communication proceeds on that channel. The terminal then selects a new next available channel and moves the marker signal to that new channel. The remaining mobile radio telephones then scan until they detect the new marker signal and camp on the next available channel. The specific details of addressing and signaling including the exchange of signals, between the terminal and a mobile radio telephone, for dedicating a particular communication channel to a specific mobile radio telephone will not be described. These details can all be obtained from the Rypinski, Jr. patent cited above. The above described known radio telephone system functioned adequately when there were a few radio telephone subscribers and few communication channels within the systems. However, as populations became more dense and the number of radio telephone subscribers and communication channels increased, difficulties began to develop in the operation of radio telephone systems. Each communication channel includes a band of operating frequencies, the bandwidth,frquency range, and channel spacing of which regulated by a government agency. For each communication channel, the terminal includes a transmitter, receiver, and antenna system operable on that channel. When a plurality of such transmitters, receivers, and antennas are located near to one another, a certain amount of radio frequency RF energy from a first transmitter and antenna, operating on a first channel, is coupled to a second transmitter and antenna operating on a second channel. This energy mixes with the signals generated by the second transmitter to form various signals on sum and difference frequencies known as intermodulation IM products.When RF energy on the marked channel, containing marker signal modulation mixes with the signals generated on an unmarked channel to form IM products, the IM products may contain marker signal modulation. In addition to the basic sum and difference IM products, harmonics of the various sum and difference combinations are also generated. The result is a plurality of spurious signals many of which contain marker signal modulation information. With increasing numbers of channels dedicated for radio telephone communication, the number of such spurious signals multiplies and it becomes more and more likely that such spurious signals fall in or adjacent to dedicated communication channels or are within the lock range of the channel scanner of a mobile radio telephone. As a result, there is an increase in ambiguity in seizing and locking onto the communication channel intended for next communication. A mobile radio telephone may seize and lock onto a channel having only a spurious IM product containing marker signal modulation thereon. Attempted communication on such an improperly seized channel will not result in a communication link being established dnd the mobile radio telephone must abort its attempted call and re scan the channels to locate the marked next available channel.This results in a substantial amount of lost time. Similarly, when a call is originated by a telephone subscriber for a specific mobile radio telephone, the intended radio telephone recipient of the call may be camped on the wrong channel as a result of a spuriousIM product containing marker signal modulation. Much time is wasted in establishing communication with the intended radio telephone. The IM product problem becomes extensive for large international systems wherein many equally spaced channels may be employed. In addition to the problem of locking onto an IM spurious channel marker, the problem of search time, i.e. the time for scanning to locate the next available channel, becomes extensive when a large number of channels must be scanned each time a new marker channel is designated by the terminal. In essence, the terminal must wait the amount of time that it takes a mobile radio telephone to scan a large number of channels before it can place a new land to mobile call.Time must be allocated for all scanning to be completed before a mobile to land mobile to terminal call can be placed. These scanning times subtract from the maximum number of calls that can be placed from telephone subscribers to mobile radio telephones. In order to minimize the IM product problem, some systems transmit a reduced carrier power signal on channels currently unused for communication to mask any IM products that may have been generated within the channel. This technique is also known as the Fo technique. Usually, power levels in excess of one 1 watt are necessaryfor Fg operation. Of course, the power level required for Fg operation depends upon the amount of isolation available through circulators present in the antenna combiner associated with the terminal. Even though somewhat effective, the use of Fg operation generates additional IM products outside of the communication channels oh a continuous basis.This may cause interference with other radio services.In addition, standby or Fg power levels may have to be raised to much more than 1 watt when large numbers of channels are used or when design short cuts have been taken in the antenna combining apparatus resulting in a substantial amount of dissipated power at the terminal. Thus, Fg or reduced carrier power operation does not completely overcome the difficulties associated with the operation of mobile radio telephone systems having a large number of channels. Another scheme that has been attempted to overcome the IM product utilizes a logic circuit within a mobile radio telephone. The logic circuit matches a channel number encoded on the channel. with the channel to which the mobile radio telephone is tuned.Problems arise with this approach, however, in that the length of time required to search all of the channels is lengthened considerably. This is because a longer look on each channel is required in order to distinguish between a valid channel number and other signals such as dialing signals, hand shaking tones, or voice signals. Also, it is difficult for logic within the mobile radio telephone to distinguish between a valid channel number modulation and a seize tone response when it attempts to place a mobile to terminal call. Thus, this approach is also inadequate. Yet another approach to overcoming the operational difficulties caused by IM products is to use channel guard tones to indicate whether a mobile radiotelephone is tuned to the correct channel.. Such a system works adequately where the system includes only a small number of channels. However, this approach fails when approximately sixteen 16 or more channels are in the system. This failure results from the considerably longer channel scan time required to decode a channel guard tone. This seriously limits the call throughput capability of a large system. Another difficulty attendant the channel guard tone approach is that the number of guard frequencies required. is equal to half the number of channels operable within the system. This number of guard frequencies results from the requirement of preventing IM products from appearing on any inband channel.Thus, as an example, a 32 channel system would require 16 different channel guard frequencies. Another scheme for overcoming the IM product problem would be to utilize different marker channel tones for each channel. This approach is relatively simple in that a mobile radio telephone would automatically set its tone detector to look at the marker tone associated with the channel to which the mobile is tuned, regardless of which channel that happens to be.However, N 2 different marker frequencies for an N channel system would be required. The required tone separation between markers and the possibility of interfering with some of the other call processing tones renders this approach quite cumbersome. For radio telephone systems operating in theUnited States, the Bell System specifies that a mobile radio telephone must remain on each channel for 250 milliseconds before it steps to the next channel during the marker search process. Thus, pver 8 seconds are required for one complete scan in a 32 channel system. This time span is excessive because it detracts considerably from the call throughput rate for calls initiated from a telephone subscriber intended for a mobile radio telephone. For international systems, the detection algorithm is slightly changed from the U.S. system. In the international system, a mobile radio telephone steps to the next channel as soon as it determines that the marker signal is not present to the channel to. which it is tuned.This type of scanning generally takes 50 80 milliseconds where only unsquelched voice is present on a channel 20 milliseconds synthesized oscillator switching time plus 30 50 milliseconds detection time . However, the presence of voice communication on a channel will likely stretch this time to 100 150 milliseconds or longer before the tone detector logic of the mobile radio telephone can determine that it is extraneous information and not a marker tone. Fast scanning will reduce the time required for marker search by approximately 50 . However, the terminal must still wait 4 5 seconds to comple te telephone subscriber initiated calls. The object of the present invention is to provide a mobile radio telephone arrangement that overcomes the operational disadvantages of the prior art systems.Namely, one which overcomes the IM product problem associated with known systems having a large number of channels, and which reduces the lengthy search time associated with such prior art systems. In short, the basic concept of the present invention is that one of the communication channels is designated as a marker control channel. On this channel, a signal identifying the next vacant channel is transmitted. The next vacant channel as determined by the terminal is encoded on the marker channel, and may be a two digit marker for systems with up to 99 channels. The terminal always assigns the next channel in some predetermined sequence or randomly until all channels become occupied with communication. When this occurs, the encoded channel number becomes the same as the marker channel and the marker channel is then used for the next communication. In general, all mobile radio telephones search for the marker channel. Once the marker channel is found, a mobile radio telephone continues to monitor the marker channel regardless of which channel is identified as being next available for communication.The next available channel information is decoded and stored in a memory associated with the mobile radiotelephone. As the information related to the next available channel transmitted on. the marker channel changes, the memory of each mobile radio telephone is updated. Thus, the memory within each mobile radio telephone contains the identity of the next available channel. When a mobile radio telephone receives or initiates a call, it simply consults its memory and switches to the channel for next communication retrieved therefrom. This arrangement provides for considerable operational improvement. On land originated calls, i.e. a telephone subscriber dials the telephone number of a mobile radio telephone, the address telephone number of the mobile radio telephone to which the call is directed is transmitted by the terminal following a transmission of the channel assignment number on the marker channel. The mobile radio telephone that has been addressed detects and recognizes its address and switches to the designated channel number stored within its memory and answers the call by transmitting on the designated channel 750 milliseconds of guard tone standard IMTS . The terminal receives the guard tone and in response generates a ring tone on the designated channel for up to 60 seconds or so or until the mobile radio telephone answers the ring by transmitting 400 milliseconds of connect tone.The remainder of the mobile radio telephones, which are monitoring the marker channel, remain on the marker channel. The terminal then changes the channel number designation on the marker channel to the next vacant channel immediately upon completion of the dialed address. As long as channel number identification information is being transmitted on the marker channel, any mobile radio telephone may attempt to place originate a call by going off hook . A mobile radio telephone originating a call consults its memory and automatically switches to the channel designated as the next available channel. This switching occurs within a predefined time window typically 250 milliseconds following the end of a channel identification word on the marker channel . The mobile radio telephone originating a call, after switching to the next available channel, transmits a guard tone on that next available channel for 350 milliseconds.Following the transmission of this guard tone, the mobile radio telephone transmits 50 milliseconds of a connect tone and then more guard tone. The terminal, upon receiving these signals transmitted by the call originating radio telephone, transmits a seize tone at a predetermined time interval. This seize tone, in effect, signals the mobile radio telephone that it has seized the next available channel.After an indication of seizure, the mobile radiotelephone originating a call sends its ANI code on the seized channel. Upon receipt of a valid ANI code, the terminal transmits a dial tone on the channel. The mobile radio telephone then transmits a dialed telephone number designating a land based or another mobile radio telephone subscriber to be contacted via the terminal. The remainder of the mobile radio telephones, not in communication, continue to monitor the marker channel. However, the terminal changes the encoded channel number immediately upon receiving a guard tone on the previously designated channel. Thus, without any scanning, the remaining mobile radiotelephones update their respective memories to identify the next. available channel. To further preclude the possibility of contention between mobile to terminal and terminal to mobile calls, a conflict resolution algorithm can be implemented. This algorithm requires the reception of two or three consecutive channel numbers before an attempt to originate a call can be implemented.The use of such an algorithm reduces the possibility that a radio telephone may incorrectly interpret numbers contained within a land to mobile call sequence as being a channel number. As a further precuation, the terminal ignores any guard tone that may be received on the designated channel during the time it is transmitting the address information of a mobile radio telephone. The radio telephone arrangement, provided by this invention, overcomes both the IM product and search time problems because a mobile radio telephone can immediately switch to the next available channel designated by a signal on the marker channel when a call is to be originated or received. This immediate switching occurs even if the mobile radio telephone was inadvertently camped on an IM marker channel.The next available channel to which. a mobile radiotelephone switches is determined solely by the information stored within its memory. Thus, valuable time is not wasted in determining the next available channel when that information is needed. The optional use of the American Telephone Telegraph IMTS algorithm provides a randomization of the mobile radiotelephones over a period less than the two or three channel number repeat period in their attempts to originate calls, thereby minimizing conflicts in call origination. In a typical embodiment, twenty pulses per second PPS frequency shift key FSK signaling between a 2000 Hz mark tone not to be confused with the marker channel and an 1800 Hz space tone can be used for sending both channel number identification codes and the mobile NPA address number to further speed up signal processing. Using the same signaling format as that used for dialing simplifies hardware implementation both in the radio telephone and at the terminal. In accordance with one aspect of the invention there is provided a method for establishing communication between a central terminal of a radiotelephone system and a mobile raaio telephone over one of. a group of communications channels characterised in that the central terminal transmits a channel identification signal on one of the communication channels designated as a marker channel, the channel identification signal providing an identification of the next available channel as assigned by the central terminal for communication between a mobile radiotelephone station and the central terminal, and in that the mobile radio telephone station scans the communication channels to locate the marker channel by detecting the channel identification signal transmitted thereon and stores the identity of the next available channel as specified by the channel identification signal detected during the scanning step. A system for implementing the above described method would establish communication between a central terminal of a radio telephone system and a mobile radio telephone station over one of a group of communication channels and comprise the following means located at the central terminal for transmitting a channel identification signal on one of the communications channels designated as a marker channel, the channel identification signal providing an identification of the next available channel for communication as assigned by the central terminal for communication between a mobile radiotelephone station and the central terminal means located at the mobile radio telephone station for scanning the communication channels to locate the marker channel by detecting the channel identification signal transmitted thereon and for storing the identity of the next available channel as specified by the channel identification signal detected by the scanning means. Specific signaling and tone examples for calls to and from mobile radio telephone stations will be discussed in greater detail in the detailed description to follow. By way of example only FIGURE 1 is a functional block diagram illustrating an embodiment of the present invention FIGURE 2 is a simplified functional block diagram of the relevant parts of a mobile radiotelephone FIGURE 3 is a graphical representation of the marker identification code format FIGURE 4 illustrates a typical land to mobile call sequence FIGURE 5 illustrates a typical mobile to land call sequence FIGURE 6 illustrates a typical land to mobile call sequence where the marker channel is the next available channel for communication and FIGURE 7 illustrates a typical mobile toland call sequence where the marker channel is the next available channel for communication. The radio telephone system illustrated inFig. 1 includes a terminal 10 permanently installed at a central control facility and coupled to a telephone network operated by a local telephone company. Associated with terminal 10 are a plurality of transmitters receivers 12 1 ... 12 N operating respectively on predetermined communication channels 1...N. The radio telephone system includes a plurality of mobile radio telephones 14 A...14 XXX.The radio telephone system is flexible to the extent that the number of channels can be increased or decreased by appropriate activation or deactivation of transmitters and receivers 12 and by the addition or deletion of mobile radio telephone stations 14. The basic hardware is known and is illustrated by U.S. Patent 3,173,996 Rypinski, Jr. March 16, 1965 . This patent is incorporated herein by reference. Based upon the description in the present patent, the hardware modifications necessary to the Rypinski, Jr. arrangement and the method of operation of the present invention should be clear to one of ordinary skill in the art. The central concept of this invention is the use of one of the channels 1...N as a marker control channel. The marker control channel could be any one of the channels so designated. On the marker channel, information as to the next available channel for communication is encoded, preferably as a two digit number. Of course, other types of coding could be used. As channels become utilised for communication, terminal 10 changes the next available channel in accordance with a predetermined sequence until all channels become occupied with in process calls. This sequence could simply be a rotation of channel numbers or any other sequence including a random channel number assignment. When all channels, other than the marker channel, have become occupied with in process calls, the encoded two digit number representing the next available channel becomes the same as the marker channel. In general, all mobile radio telephones 14 search or scan for the marker channel. The marker channel is located by detecting the two digit code transmitted thereon.Once found, each mobile radiotelephone 14 continues to monitor the marker channel. Referring now to Figure 2, there is shown a simplified block diagram of the relevant parts of a mobile radio telephone 14. Mobile radio telephone 14 includes a transmitter 16, a receiver 18, an antenna coupling system 20, and a memory 22. Receiver 18 scans the communication channels looking for the marker channel. Once the marker channel is located, the two digit number encoded thereon is detected by receiver 18. The information detected by receiver 18 is stored in memory 22. Memory 22 is preferably a random access memory RAM that can be written into and read from by appropriate command signals coupled thereto. Thus the marker information transmitted on the marker channel causes memory 22 to store a number representing the next available communication channel. The contents of memory 22 are updated in accordance with new information transmitted on the marker channel as necessary. For a land to mobile call, ie a call placed by a land based telephone subscriber or radio telephone through terminal 10 to a radio telephone subscriber, a telephone subscriber within the telephone network dials a telephone number specifying the address telephone number of a mobile radio telephone 14.This will generally be a three digit NPA code.plus a four digit address. Terminal 10 causes the address of the specific mobile radio telephone 14 to be transmitted by the transmitter receiver 12 operating on the marker channel. The address information preferably follows a transmission of the two digit channel assignment number indicating the next available channel for communication. Of course, a schemecould be devised wherein the address information is transmitted with some other temporal relationship to the marker channel code and such other schemes are considered to be within the scope of the present invention.The mobile radio telephone 14 to which the call was addressed, upon detecting its own address, immediately switches to the designated channel number encoded on the marker channel as previously stored in its memory and answers the call by transmitting 750 milliseconds of guard tone. It is assumed throughout this patent, that the various signals such as guard tones, ring tones etc., are those used in conventional radio telephone systems. However, this choice is merely one of convention and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. The specific choice of signals utilised for guard tones, ring tones, and the like are unimportant to an understanding of the present invention.As long as the form of the signal is known and filters are appropriately designed for their detection, any specific type of signalling or signalling sequence could be utilised. Terminal 10, via one of its transmitted receivers 12, operating on the next available channel receives the guard tone transmitted by the mobile radio telephone 14 to which the call was addressed.Terminal 10, through the transmitter associated with the next available channel, then generates a ring tone on that channel for up to 60 seconds or so or until the addressed mobile radio telephone 14 answers the ring signal by transmitting 400 milliseconds of a connect tone. This establishes communication between the addressed mobile radio telephone 14 and terminal 10 via one of transmitter receivers 12. The remainder of the mobile radio telephones 14 monitoring the marker channel remain on the marker channel. Terminal 10 selects a new next available channel number designation and transmits that information over the marker channel. All mobile radiotelephones 14, not otherwise engaged in communication, update their respective memories 22. Figure 1 illustrates a specific example of how individual radio telephones switch channels in response to commands from terminal 10. In this example, channel two 2 is designated as the marker control channel.The marker on channel two 2 contains information as ta the next available voice communication channel.In this example, it is assumed that the next available communication channel is channel six 6 and that a land based telephone subscriber is placing a call to mobile radio telephone 14 C. Terminal 10 transmits the address of mobile radio telephone 14 C on marker channel two 2 following the channel six 6 code transmitted on channel two 21. In response to detection of its address, mobile radio telephone 14 C moves to channel six 6 which was the next available channel designated by the information coded on marker channel two 2 . The movement of mobile radio telephone 14 C to channel six 6 is signified by line 30. It is also assumed that once channel six 6 is in use, the next available channel in a predetermined sequence of next available channels is channel seven 7 . Therefore, the information for channel seven 7 is encoded and transmitted on marker channel two 2 . All other mobile radio telephones 14, tuned to the marker channel channel 2 detect the information that the next available channel is now channel seven 7 and they update the information within their respective memories 22. Thus, each mobile radio telephone 14 knows that if it next communicates that communication will take place on channel seven 7 . In the example illustrated in Figure 1, it is assumed that mobile radio telephone 14 F places a call to a land based telephone subscriber. The specific call signalling sequence will be described later in this patent. However, for the purposes of the simplified discussion shown in Figure 1, mobile radiotelephone 14 F moves to channel seven 7 as called for by its own memory 22. This movement is signified by line 32. Once on channel 7, mobile radio telephone 14 F proceeds with the signalling sequence required for placing a call to a land based telephone. It is also assumed in the Figure 1 example that during the time that mobile radio telephone 14 C is receiving its call on channel six 6 and mobile radio telephone 14 F is placing its call on channel seven 7 , that mobile radio telephone 14 H was already engaged in communication on channel eight 8 .When mobile radio telephone 14 H completes its communication on channel eight 8 , it returns to monitor the marker channel channel 2 . By detecting the information encoded on the marker control channel, mobile radio telephone 14 H updates its memory 22 to incorporate the identity of the next available communications channel not shown in Figure 1 . The movement of radio telephone 14 H from channel eight 8 to marker two 2 is designated by line 34. The procedure for placing mobile to land calls is as follows As long as channel number information is being transmitted on the marker channel, any mobile radio telephone 14 may attempt to place a call by going off hook . The mobile rÅadio telephone 14 placing a call automatically switches to the next available channel, as stored within its memory 22.This switching occurs within a predefined time window .This window is typically 250 milliseconds following the ends of a channel description word. The mobile radio telephone 14 then transmits a guard tone on that channel within 350 milliseconds, following the guard tone, it transmits 50 milliseconds of connect tone and then transmits more guard tone. Terminal 10, in response, transmits a seize tone at the proper interval to signal to the mobile radio telephone 14 that is has seized the next available channel. channel. After an indication of a seized channel the mobile radio telephone 14 will then send its ANI code on the designated channel. In response to a valid ANI code, terminal 10 transmits a dial tone. Mobile radio telephone 14 then transmits the dialled telephoned number upon receipt of the dial tone transmitted by the terminal 10. The remainder of the mobile radio telephones 14 not engaged in communication continue to monitor the marker channel. Terminal 10 assigns a new next available channel and changes the encoded channel number transmitted on the marker channel immediately upon receiving a guard tone on the previously designated next available channel. To further preclude the possibility of content ion between mobile to land and land to mobile calls, logic can be incorporated into the mobile radio telephones 14 requiring that a mobile radiotelephone 14 receive and decode two or three consecutive channel numbers before attempting to originate a call. Such logic reduces the probability that a radio telephone may incorrectly interpret channel marker numbers within a down link as being a channel number. As a further precaution, terminal 10 can be caused, by logic therein, to ignore any guard tone that is received on a designated channel during the time it is transmitting the address of a mobile radio telephone 14. To prevent simultaneous contention on mobile call origination, there is available an AT algorithm that can be used in the radio telephone system.This algorithm requires the mobile radio telephone to invoke a random time delay before a mobile toland call attempt is made. Using this algorithm, radio telephones can be time randomised over a time period of less than the two or three channel number repeat periods, discussed above, in their attempts to originate calls. The preferred embodiment utilises 20 pulses per second PPS frequency shift keying FSK signalling with 2000 Hz serving as the mark tone and 1800 Hz serving as a space tone. These tones can be used for sending both the channel number and the mobile NPA address number to further speed up the signalling process. Using the same signalling format as is used for dialling simplifies hardware in both the mobile radio telephones 14 and terminal 10. An example of the marker format is shown in Figure 3. Referring now to Figure 3 there is shown a graphic representation of the marker identification code format. As previously stated, signals are transmitted by a frequency shift key FSK modulating scheme using a mark tone of 2OOO.Hz and a space tone of 1800 Hz. It is assumed in the Figure 3 example that the next available channel is channel twenty four 242 and that after channel twenty four 24 becomes in use the next available channel is twenty five 25r. The first two pulses of 2000 Hz are followed by an inter digit time of 125 or 250 milliseconds. Then, four pulses of 2000 Hz are transmitted to complete the signalling of channel twenty four 241. An inter channel number space time of 250 or 500 milliseconds is then transmitted. After the inter number space time, the number twenty four 24 is transmitted again. The central section of Figure 3 represents the transmission of a specific mobile radio telephone number address which. ultimately results in communication being established on channel twenty four 24 .Following the establishing of communication on channel twenty four 24 , the new channel designation twentyfive 25 is transmitted. In Figures 4 7, there are shown specific signalling sequences for land to mobile and mobile to land calls. Referring now to Figure 4 there is shown a graphical representation of a typical example of the land to mobile calling sequence. It is assumed that in this example that channel one 1 is the marker control channel and that it is free of communication.In addition, it is also assumed in this example that the next available channel for communication is channel twenty three 23 and that after channel twenty three 23 is placed into use, that the next available communication channel will be channel twenty four 24 .On channel one ll, the marker channel, terminal 10 transmits the number twenty three 23 at a rate of 20 PPS thereby indicating channel twenty three 231 is the communication channel next available for communication, ie the communications channel for mobiles to go to for placing or receiving calls. All mobile radio telephones 14, not otherwise engaged in communication, receive on the marker channel and decode the two digit data representing channel twenty three 23 . In accordance with their internal algorithms, mobile radio telephones 14 must decode at least two such channel identifications before they stop searching or scanning the channels to locate the marker.Between the two digits, ie the 2 and the 3 of the two digit code identifying the next available channel, there is à timing space of nominally 150 milliseconds. There is even a longer period of time between encoded messages. After three sequences of 23 , terminal equipment 10 transmits 250 milliseconds of idle tone C2000 Hzl and then 100 millisec onus of seize tone t1800 Hz2 before transmitting an address of a specific mobile radio telephone 14.The address is of the form NPA XXXX. Terminal 10 transmits the address at 20 PPS on the marker channel.The specific mobile radio telephone 14 having the correct address automatically switches to channel twenty three 23 which is the next communication channel as designated by terminal 10. All of the mobile radio telephones 14 remain on channel one 1 for a new communications channel number assignJment. Following the address transmitted by terminal 10, the terminal returns to transmitting a seize tone for nominally 190 milliseconds and then transmits an idle tone for nominally 250 milliseconds before transmitting the new communications channel number assignment. In this case, the new next available channel is twenty four 24 . Terminal equipment 10 transmits the new communications channel information on idle channel one 1 for a minimum of three times before transmitting the next land to mobile call.All the mobile radio telephones 14, not otherwise engaged in communication, remain locked or camped on the marker channel one .1 until they place or receive a call. Terminal 10 continues to change and transmit communications channel assignments and addresses telephone numbers as needed. A mobile radio telephone 14 detecting a correct address, ie its own address, switches to channel twenty three 23 , the assigned communication channel to receive its call. It begins a call receiving signal sequence by sending 750 milliseconds of guard tone. Terminal 10 detects the guard tone and sends a ring signal in bursts of two 2 seconds on, four C4 seconds off until the ring signal is answered by the mobile radio telephone or until a predetermined time for the ring signal has run. A mobile radio telephone 14 answering the ring signal transmits 400 milliseconds of connect tone upon going off hook . In this manner, channel twentythree 23 is seized and communication takes place between the mobile radio telephone 14 and a telephone subscriber via terminal 10.After the call has been completed, the mobile radio telephone 14 transmits 750 milliseconds df alternating guard and disconnect tones to effect disconnection of the communication. Referring now to Figure 5 there is shown a graphical representation of a topical example of the calling sequence for calls originated by a mobile radio telephone station calling a land based telephone subscriber. Again channel one 1 is the marker control channel. However, in this example, channel nine 9 is marked as the next available communications channel. In the signalling sequence illustrated, leading zeros are suppressed on a single digit channel number such as channel 9 .Again,the mark tone is 2000 Hz and the space tone is 1800 Hz. It is assumed that, based on an internal algorithm, channel information must be decoded three times before a mobile radio telephone 14 can go to the designated channel to place or receive a call. After detecting the channel nine 9r code transmitted on channel one two times a mobile radio telephone 14 initiates a call on channel nine 9 by transmitting 350 milliseconds of guard tone followed by 50 milliseconds of connect tone to gain access to terminal 10 Terminal 10 detects the guard tone on channel nine 9 and sends an idle tone on that channel until the terminal detects a connect tone from the mobile radio telephone 14.The mobile radio telephone 14 detects the idle tone and transmits a guard tone until it detects a seize tone transmitted from the terminal on channel nine 9 . Terminal 10, after detecting the guard tone and connect tone from the mobile, sends the seize tone on channel nine 9 for 50 milliseconds. After the mobile radio telephone 14 detects the seize tone, transmitted by terminal 10, it sends its ANI code at 20 PPS on channel nine 9 , 190 milliseconds after detection of the seize tone transmitted by terminal 10. Terminal 10 decodes a valid ANI code transmitted by a mobile radio telephone 14 and returns a dial tone on the assigned channel until dial pulses are received from the mobile radio telephone or a predetermined amount of time elapses. The mobile radiotelephone 14 detects the dial tone from the terminal and sends its dial pulses at 20 PPS. Once connection is made, a conversation takes place between the radiotelephone 14 and a telephone subscriber via terminal 10. At the end of a telephone conversation, the mobile radio telephone terminates the call by transmitting 750 milliseconds of alternating guard and disconnect tones at 20 PPS. While cor .munic at ion is taking place on channel nine 9 , terminal 10 transmits a new next channel assignment on the marker channel. In this case, the next channel is twenty five 25 .and the terminal transmits on channel one 11 the coded information designating channel twenty five 25 . Terminal 10 transmits the new communication channel number twenty five 25 for a minimum of three times on the marker channel before transmitting a land tomobile call address. Terminal 10 continues to transmit the communication channel assignment number twenty five 25 , until a land to mobile call occurs or a new communication channel is assigned by virtue of another call originated by a mobile radiotelephone 14. Referring now to Figure 6, there is graphically illustrated a typical example of the land tomobile call sequence when the marker channel is itself designated as the next available channel for communication. In this example, channel one 1 is the marker channel and is also designated as the next available communication channel. Terminal 10 transmits the communication channel number one lion the marker channel, also channel one 1 , at 20 PPS. Channel one 1 is marked as the communication channel since it is the last channel available for mobile radiotelephones 14 to go for placing or receiving calls, ie all other channels are in use for communication.Mobile radio telephones 14, in accordance with their internal algorithms, must decode at least two channel identifications before locking onto the marker channel.Terminal 10 transmits 250 milliseconds of idle tone then 100 milliseconds of seize tone before transmitting a mobile radio telephone address NPA XXXX.When a call has been originated by a land based subscriber intended for a mobile radio telephone 14, terminal 10 transmits the land to mobile call with the mobile NPA XXXX address on the idle channel channel 1 . The mobile radio telephone 14 with the correct address NPA XXXX remains on the marker channel since it is the assigned communications channel for receiving the call. The other mobile radio telephones 14 begin to search for a new marker channel with the communication channel information. After transmitting the NPA XXXX address, terminal 10 returns to transmitting a seize tone for 19.0 milliseconds. The mobile radio telephone 14 having the correct NPA XXXX address transmits a guard tone which is detected by terminal 10.Terminal 10 then transmits a ring signal at 20 PPS in bursts of two seconds on and four seconds off until the mobile radio telephone 14 designated addressed2 answers or until a predetermined period of time has elapsed. The mobile radiotelephone 14 designates then sends 400 milliseconds of connect tone upon going off hook. A conversation between the designated mobile radio telephone 14 and the land based telephone subscriber originatinggthe call then takes place. The mobile radio telephone 14 terminates the call by transmitting 750 milliseconds of alternating guard tone and disconnect tone at 20 PPS. Referring now to Figure 7, there is graphically shown a typical example of the mobile to land call sequence on the marked idle channel. Again it is assumed that channel one 1L is the marker channel and it is also designated as the next channel available for communication. Terminal 10 transmits the communication channel information number of the marked channel at 20 PPS. Channel one 1 is marked as the next available communication channel since it is the last available channel for communications, ie the last channel available for mobile radio telephones 14 to go to for placing or receiving a call. A mobile radio telephone must decode at least two channels before locking onto the idle channel for communication.A mobile radio telephone 14 initiating a call on the marker channel transmits 350 milliseconds of guard tone followed by 50 milliseconds of connect tone to gain access to the terminal. Terminal 10 detects the guard tone and detect tone on the marked channel since it is the communication channel and then sends a seize tone for 50 milliseconds. The mobile radio telephone originating the call sends a guard tone until detection of the seize tone from terminal 10.Upon receipt of the seize tone from terminal 10, the mobile radio telephone 14 originating the call sends its ANI code at 20 PPS on the assigned channel, ie channel one 1 , 190 milliseconds after detection of the seize tone from terminal 10. All of the other mobile radio telephones 14 begin to search for a new marker channel having communication channel information encoded thereon upon the loss of marked idle channel one 1 . Upon receipt of a valid ANI from the mobile radio telephone 14 originating the call, terminal 10 transmits a dial tone on channel one 1 since this is the communications channel. The mobile radio telephone 14 detects the dial tone and in response thereto transmits its dial pulses. After appropriate connection, a conversation takes place.At the end of the conversation, the mobile radiotelephone 14 terminates its call by transmitting 750 milliseconds of alternating guard and disconnect tones. There has therefore been provided a mobile radio telephone system and method of operation that overcomes both the IM and search time problems attendant with known systems. There is no need for transmission of low power signals Fg on unused channels and a radio telephone can immediately switch to the correct channel for next communication when a call attempt is made or when a call is received even if it has been inadvertently camped on an IM marker channel, ie not the correct marker channel. Of course, as stated above, the invention is not specifically limited to the signalling arrangements shown in the specific examples. Rather, many alternatives are possible and it is expected that such alternatives will occur to one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the teachings contained herein. Therefore, such alternatives are intended to be included within the scope of claim coverage.
