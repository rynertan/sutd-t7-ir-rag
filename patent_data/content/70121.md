## Description
SILICON CARBIDE FURNACE This invention relates to a silicon carbide manufacturing plant comprising an electrical power source a furnace enclosure an electrical resistance furnace disposed within the enclosure and operated.by electric heating forthepreparation of silicon carbide from a load of silicious and carbonaceous material, the current being supplied by means of electrodes through a resistance core of carbon horizontally inserted within a load, said core and load being of broken ring configuration. silicon carbide may be formed under various time temperature conditions from mixtures of carbon and o silica or silicon. It can be formed as low as 525 C from silicon and carbon under special conditions from a carbon enriched alloy of silicon, aluminum and zinc.Silicon carbide crystals have also been prqduced by gaseous cracking in at least five vapor systems. It is produced primarily in batch type furnaces ranging up to 18.29 m long by 3.05 m wide and holding up to about 90,718 Kg of sand coke mix. The furnace walls commonly consist of removable sections of cast iron frames lined with low grade firebrick. The conventional or cheson furnace has essentially remained unchanged for the past seventy ears. The mix is delivered to the furnace b a hopper and an overhead traveling crane or by conveyors.When the furnace is approximately half full, the loading is interrupted temporarily so that a loose graphite core can be placed between the electrodes located at each end of the furnace. The core is of uniform cross section and may be about 254 mm thick and 406.4 mm wide, depending upon the size of the furnace.Placing the balance of the mix above the core completes the loading operation. The conventional furnace requries approximately four men to load the mix at a rate of approximately 40 to 45 tonnes per hour. The foregoing provides a productivity ratio of approximately 10 to 11 tonnes per man hour. Power is applied at rates up to about 5,000 kw and at voltages ranging from approximately 500 to 200 as the resistance of the charge changes during the heating period of about one and a half days. The heated charge requires several days cooling to permit handling. Upon removing the sidewalls, the loose covering falls away exposing the ingot. The covering is similar in composition to the original mix and is reused. The ingot is oval in cross section and is encased in a crust of about 25.4 50.8 mm thick. This relatively thin crust forms because the temperature gradient at the position favors condensation of the oxide impurities. This concentration facilitates the effective disposal of the unwanted impurities. The ignot proper, containing the commercial crystals of silicon carbide, is broken into large sections and removed from the furnace. The graphite core is recovered for reuse as a core material. The crystalline ingot is finally crushed and is screened to desired sizes.Depending upon end use, the grain may be further treated by cleaning with acid or alkali, then washed with water and dried. The above described process is well known as the Acheson process. Such furnace installations usually require four to six furnaces for each transformer in order to utilize the transformer to its maximum efficiency, with one furnace heating, one being unloaded, one loading, and the remainder cooling. This requires very large capital investment in buildings and furnaces. The unloading of such furnaces is quite difficult and tedious because of the adjacent hot furnaces and because of the necessity of using large amounts of hand labor to remove the silicon carbide from the furnace due to the proximity of the adjacent furnaces and the difficulty of using mechanical unloading equipment in the restricted floor space available. This also requires that the furnaces be cooled an extraordinarily long time before unloading in order to get the temperature down to the point where the hand labor can be effectively used.A further problem arises in the loading of such furnaces beacuse of the adjacent other furnaces. This means lengthy conveyor belts from the mixing bins to the furnaces or overhead cranes carrying successive bucket loads to the furnace. The entire process takes between 6 to 7 days from start to finish. A conventioanl plant, with six furnaces per transformer and six transformers requires 40 to 50 men for operation on a continuous shift basis. It has been proposed in Dutch patent application 8004762 to form the furnace core and load as a broken ring configuration, located free standing within a heating enclosure or building. Whilst this proposal greatly improves the efficiency of the installation as compared with the prior art described above, the installation proposed did suffer from several disadvantages.In particular, a complex overhead conveyor system was necessary to form the core, and this system required the provision of an extensive load carrying overhead support structure. The present invention is characterised in that the broken ring configuration of the core and load defines a centrally located generally circular working space, and a materials handling device for loading the furnace is supported for rotation at the centre of the working space. The furnace of the present invention is designed to significantly reduce the oeprating costs of the process by optimizing power usage and increasing the loading productivity ratio to approximately 100 to 110 tonne per man hour. The ten fold loading productivity ratio increase 100 of the preferred embodiment as compared with the prior art can be directly attributed to the design of the furnace disclosed herein which accommodates automated material handling apparatus for loading of the mix into the furnace. Further, the novel design permits utilization of large machinery, such a payloaders or the like, for unloading the furnace. The invention will be better understood from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof, given by way of example only, reference being had to the accompanying drawing, wherein Figure 1 is a plan view of a silicon carbide manufacturing plant Figure 2 is an elevation view of a portion of the plant illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a sectional view of a prior art furnace. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, there is shown a furnace installation situated within a heating enclosure of building 2. As illustration, the building is preferably dome shaped and may be constructed as a geodesic dome. A conveyor not shown brings the raw materials, silicious and caronaceous, already properly mixed, from a main building to the enclosure. This conveyor discharges onto a cross conveyor not shown which empties onto material handling device 6, to be more fully described hereinafter, located above the broken ring furnace to be formed. This device loads furnace 8 with the proper charge of raw materials 10. It also places graphite core 12 in its desired location with respect to the charge of materials. The furnace design is an angle of repose furnace, preferably, and does not employ any sidewalls or gates to contain the furnace charge. However, sidewalls may be employed if desired. Further, furnace 8 is shaped in a broken ring configuration to define a central working space z. Material handling device 6 includes a rotatable stacking member 34. One end of member 34 is rotatably supported upon pedestal 36 located at the center of working space 32. The other end of member 34 has a wheel 42 or similar device attached thereto. The wheel is supported upon track 28 circumferentially connected to the inner surface of sidewall 44 of building 2. Stacking member 34 includes a discharge chute 48 or similar device alignable with core 12. As stacking member 34 rotates about its centrally located support pedestal 36, the raw materials fall via chute 48 in a generally ring like pattern. However, a sector of the ring is left open hence the broken ring configuration for furnace 8 for permitting ready access to working space 32. In loading the furnace, the bottom portion is first formed and then stopped. Next core 12 is laid on the mixture. Then the furnace is topped off in a triangular like configuration. Once this is accomplished, an electrical power source, such as transformer 14, is electrically connected to electrodes 16 located at either end of the furnace via bus bars 18. Because the furnace is almost a complete ring, and the transformer is located near the two endwalls 20 of the furnace, very short bus work runs are needed to make this connection. The transformer may serve the furnace shown and an adjacent furnace or furnaces 22 located in another heating enclosure 24, to start operations when the first furnace is being cooled. The power applied through the bus bars, electrodes and through the core, may be either AC orDC. The power is sufficient to provide a temperature to react the silicious and carbonaceous material to form silicon carbide. Once the heating cycle is complete, transformer 14 is disconnected and the cooling unloading procedure begins.The furnace is cooled and unloaded in stages. Initially, the furnace pile is allowed to cool, undisturbed, for several days. At this time, a mobile shovel such as front end loader 26 or other equipment is brought into the enclosure. This equipment begins to unload the furnace by stripping the overburden pile in stages. Since the furnace has a broken ring configuration, the mobile shovel can be brought into working space 32 through the opening formed between endwalls 20. Shovel 26 may be used to mechanically strip the overburden. In conventional silicon carbide furnace designs, the unloading as well as most of the loading processes must be accomplished through costly and time consuming methods. The stripping operation is done so that the hotter material below the surface of the pile is continuously exposed to air.Once the furnace overburden pile is removed and the silicon carbide ingot is exposed, it is allowed to cool for several days. The cooling of the ingot may be aided by a water spray. After the cooling period, the ingot is removed from the furnace by the same unloading equipment and taken to a central cleaning and sorting area. Once the ingot is removed from the furnace the loading cycle may be repeated. Pollutants formed during the loading, heating and stripping steps pass through duct 28 and are collected and processed in auxiliary equipment 30 forming a pollutant processing station. The discharge from equipment 30 meets government emission standards. Historically, pollutant emissions from silicon carbide furnacing plants have been a major problem for the industry. This is the only plant as presently known by the inventor which effectively deals with the pollution problem during all phases of the furnace operation. As the walls of dome 2 are impermeable, all of the pollutants formed during the process are entrapped within the building and prevented from escaping to the atmosphere. It should be noted since the walls of building 2 are generally circular as is the shape of furnace 8, a second working space 46 is formed therebetween. As illustrated in Fig. 1, shovel 26 can move through the second working space for delivering the overburden to a screening system 50 for subsequent recycling into the raw material staging area. The above described plant reduces operating costs in manufacturing silicon carbide. Less manpower is required. The shorter bus bars reduce cost of material and reduce electrical loss. Polluticn control is readily achieved. The furnace is more easily loaded and unloaded.Hazard to workers is materially reduced since they need not be in the plant heating enclosure when the furnace is in operation. Referring to Fig. 3, there is illustrated a sectional view of a relatively new silicon carbide furnace which has attempted to solve some of the inherent disadvantages associated with the conventional Acheson furnace. This prior art furnace 52 is disclosed in UnitedStates patent 4,158,744 and comprises a generally U shaped resistance core 54, entirely surrounded by raw material 56 reactive overburden . The furnace of the present invention, due to its generally ring like configuration1 may be loaded by an automated material handling device such as stacking member 34. In effect, the configuration of the furnace herein disclosed enables a relatively simple, single point rotating device to be employed in loading the furnace.The simple, single point rotating device cannot be advantageously employed with the prior art U shaped furnace having two straight parallel legs joined by a semi circular connecting portion. Further, in the prior art furnace, electrical insulating materials must be placed between the electrodes to prevent current leakage between the parallel straight legs. Such insulating materials can contaminate the raw materials forming the reactive overburden. The insulating materials are required since the burden is placed between the two legs thus providing an electrical flow path therebetween. The arrangement of the present invention does not require the use of insulating material between adjacent electrodes 16 since the graphite core and its overlying reactive burden diverge from the electrodes. The air in working space 32 acts as a natural insulator to prevent undesired current leakage. As may readily be observed with reference toFigures 1 and 2, the furnace of the present invention permits the electrodes to be placed relatively close to each other to minimize bus bar lengths to reduce electrical losses. The design also enables relatively simple material handling devices to be used for loading and unloading the furnace to substantially increase the productivity ratio, i.e. as noted previously a 1000 increase in productivity ratio is obtained.
