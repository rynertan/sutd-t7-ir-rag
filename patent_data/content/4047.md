# Ribbon cartridge.

## Abstract
In a cartridge 14 for an endless typewriter ribbon 10 , a fresh ribbon is stored in the cartridge 14 with a substantial length of ribbon 10 wound in a convolute around a roller 26 . When the cartridge 14 is mounted in a printing apparatus, the ribbon 10 is drawn from the cartridge 14 , exhausting the convolute. When the cartridge 14 is fully mounted in position in the printer, a single path of ribbon 10 extends into the cartridge 14 and through an opening 24 along a chord of the roller 26 and out from the cartridge 14 . A brake 28 is provided to limit motion of the roller 26 so as to preclude premature unwinding of the convolute and to limit oscillation of the roller 26 during operation of the printer. With the normal operating path of the ribbon 10 extending through the chord oriented slot 24 of the roller 26 , ribbon 10 can readily be rewound onto the roller 26 upon removal of the cartridge 14 from the printer.
