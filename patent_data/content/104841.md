# Removing phosphorous from iron.

## Abstract
To remove phosphorus from iron to a desired level, a charge of the iron is melted in a vessel followed by either i supplying gas such as 40 CO₂ 9 CO 51 H₂ to the charge before melting is complete, or ii adding, to the charge, iron which is partly or wholly oxidised equivalent to adding iron ore of up to 8 of the charge weight, or a combination of i and ii , such as would at 1600 C supply an oxygen partial pressure of at least 10 ¹⁰ atmospheres. Then, when the surface of the charge is substantially molten but before the surface of the charge reaches 155 C, either a slag is removed from the surface of the charge or b a refractory oxide compatible with the vessel lining is added sufficient to form a viscous slag or c permissible only with a basic vessel lining basic oxide s and optionally a flux are added to form a fluid slag.
