## Description
METHOD OF BASTING IN THE TAILORING OF CLOTHES This invention relates to a method of basting in the tailoring of clothes. In the process for tailoring clothes composed of 2 or 3 layers selected from suitings, linings and interlinings used in clothings, particularly coats and suits, basting has heretofore been necessary for preventing the two or three layers from slipping out of position or preventing balance from being broken when sewing different fabrics, for example, suitings and linings. Accordingly, the basting working is important for obtaining a good quality in the sewing working. In general, when two sheets of cloth are basted, a jamping sewing machine is used. In the basting of a three dimensional portion such as the basting of interlinings or the basting of facings, the sewing must be conducted so that the outer track cloth absorbs the difference in length from the inner track cloth or the room for preventing the outer track cloth from being partially stretched. Therefore, the sheets of cloth must be delicately manipulated by hand such as shirring or elongating the cloth while running the sewing machine. Thus, workers are required to have experience and skill for such a complicated technique. Therefore, the quality and the productivity are not stable.Also, the basting of interlinings is the working of securing the haircloth and the front bodice which is the basic working in tailoring. However, the front bodice must be three dimensionally designed to accommodate the volume of chest and the indention of waist, and hence, working is difficult. A difficult technique is required to meet the requirements that after the basting of interlinings the front bodice should not be in excess of the interlinings and that the wars of the cloth is straight.As a further requirement, the finishing should be such that the cloth is naturally internally curled correspondingly to the curve of bust and waist. Accordingly, in the conventional sewing process, the basting working including conventional basting and basting of interlinings and shoulder pads in tailoring a suit cannot be omitted, and the working is complete5,i manual and requires skill.Therefore, it is difficult to increase the production efficiency and uniformize the products by automatization and labor reduction. This invention aims at providing a basting method which can be substituted for the conventional method of basting sheets of cloth with thread and which comprises applying a thermosetting adhesive comprising as the main component a liquid, additionreaction type silicone polymer to the necessary peripheral portions of one of the sheets of cloth to be secured, setting the sheets with the adhesive between them on a base board or the fixed base of a press and heat pressing the resulting assembly in order to stabilize the quality and increase the production efficiency, thereby reducing skillful manual labor and enabling the partial automatization of sewing operation. Thus, said method enables a product having a uniform and stable quality to be produced in a short time, and increases the production efficiency. According to this invention, there is provided a method of basting sheets of cloth in tailoring clothes, which comprises applying a thermosetting adhesive comprising as the main component a liquid, addition reactiontype silicone polymer, to the necessary portions of one of the sheets of cloth, setting the cloth with the adhesive and the other sheet or sheets of cloth on a base board so that the adheisve is present between the sheets of cloth, heat pressing the resulting assembly to secure the sheets of cloth with the adhesive. The thus basted sheets can be easily peeled off from each other by hand without damaging the cloth. In this invention, the material for the cloth to be used is not critical, and may be of a natural fiber such as cotton, linen, wool, cashmere or the like, or a regenerated or semi synthetic fiber such as rayon, acetate or the like, or a synthetic fiber such as polyester fiber, polyamide fiber, acrylic fiber or the like.These may be used alone or in admixture. Other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following description and the accompanying drawings. In the accompanying drawings, Fig. 1 shows a rough plan view of haircloth used in the basting method of this invention, Fig. 2 shows a rough plan view of a shoulder pad used in the present basting method, Fig. 3 to Fig. 6 show rough plan views of each step of basting interlinings for the basting method of this invention,Fig. 7 shows a longitudinal section of a nozzle used in applying an adhesive to cloth in the basting method of this invention, Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 show rough plan views of the steps of another mode of the basting method of this invention, Figs. 10 12 show rough plan views of the steps of basting the facing, and Figs. 13 15 show rough plan views of the steps of basting two back bodices. Common reference numbers are used in Figs. 1 15, and reference numeral 1 refers to the movable member of a press, 2 to the fixed base of a press, 3 to an adhesive, 4 to haircloth, 5 to a shoulder pad, 6 to a front bodice, 7 to the warp of the haircloth 4, 8 to the warp of the front bodice 6, A and B to points on the base board 2 for fitting the warp 7 of the haircloth 4 or the warp 8 of the front bodice 6, 9 to the final sewing line, 10 to points for fitting the haircloth 4 and the front bodice 6, 11 to the margin to sew up the front bodice 6, 12 to the facing, 13 to the margin to sew up the facing, 14 and 14 to the back bodices, 15 and 15 to the margines to sew up the back bodices 14 and 14 , a to the diameter of the nozzle, and b to the wall thickness of the end of the nozzle. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the present adhesive 3 is applied to the haircloth 4 and the shoulder pad 5 by means of an appropriate commercially available application machine. The adhesive is applied in such a thickness and a width that the adhesive does not ooze through even a thin cloth for summer suit, preferably a thickness of 0.01 2 mm and a width of 0.1 10 mm, more preferably a thickness of 0.05 0.8 mm and a width of 0.3 3 mm. Preferably, the application machine is such that the adhesive can be extruded continuously or intermittently at a constant rate in the form of a fine line, and the nozzle used in this case has preferably a caliber of 0.2 1 mm see a in Fig. 7 and a wall thickness of 0.1 0.8 mm at the tip see b in Fig. 7 . When a is less than 0.2 mm, the nozzle tends to be blocked with the adhesive, and when it is more than 1 mm, the adhesive is apt to ooze through the cloth. When b is less than 0.1 mm the strength of the nozzle is not sufficient, and when it exceeds 0.8 mm, the adhesive adhere to the outlet of the nozzle to make it impossible for the adhesive to be extruded in the form of a fine line. The adhesive used in this invention is a composition comprising a liquid, addition reaction type silicone polymer as the main component a curing agent and if necessary, an antistatic agent, a filler, a copolymerizable monomer and other additives. The liquid, addition reaction type silicone polymer is a polysiloxane compound which can be converted into a higher molecular weight polymer by addition reaction which proceeds upon heating in the presence of a curing agent. The said polysiloxane compound includes, for example, poly C1 12aIkyl C2 12alkenylsiloxane, poly substituted C 1 12 alkyl C 2 12 alkenylsiloxane substituent halogen or the like , polyphenyl C2 12alkenylsiloxane, polysubstituted phenyl C2 12alkenylsiloxane substituent alkyl, halogen or the like , poly Cl 12alkylhydrogensiloxane, polysubstituted CS 12alkylhydrogensiloxane substituent halogen or the like , polyphenylhydrogensiloxane, and poly substituted phenylhydrogensiloxane substituent alkyl, halogen or the like , and these may be used alone or in admixture.Preferably, a mixture of the polyalkylhydrogensiloxane, the poly substituted alkylhydrogensiloxane, the polyphenylhydrogensiloxane or the poly substituted phenylhydrogensiloxane with one of the other siloxanes may be used. The curing agent includes organic peroxides such as 2,4 dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, o methylbenzoyl peroxide, p chlorobenzoyl peroxide, o chlorobenzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, bis 3 , 5, 5 trimethylhexanoyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, l,l di t butylperoxy 3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexane, t butylperoxypivalate, t butylperoxy 2 ethylhexanoate, bis 4 t butylcyclohexyl peroxydicarbonate, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide and the like platinum compounds, rhodium compounds, palladium compounds, etc. They may be used alone or in admixture of two or more. Preferably, a combination of an organic peroxide with a platinum compound is used.Among the organic peroxides, 2,4 dichlorobenzoyl peroxide is preferred. The proportion of the organic peroxide is preferably 1 30 parts by weight, more preferably 5 20 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the silicone polymer. In this invention, antistatic agents may be used alone or in combination of two or more, and the proportion thereof is preferably 0.01 to 10 parts by weight, more preferably 0.1 to 5 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the silicone polymer. As the anti static agent, there may be used anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, nonionic surfactants and amphoteric surfactants.As the anionic surfactants, there may be used, for example, fatty acid soap, alkylsulfate, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, and the like, and as the cationic surfactants, there may be used, for example, octadecyltrimethylammoniumchloride, dodecyltrimethylammoniumchloride, alkyltrimethylammoniumchloride, hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride, oxyethylenedodecylamine, polyoxyethylenedodecylamine, an isopropanol solution of alkylolaminopropyldimethyl 2 hydroxylethyl ammonium salt and the like and as the nonionic surfactants, there may be used, for example, polyoxyethylenestearylether, polyoxyethyleneoctylphenolether, fatty acid diethanol amide and the like and as the amphoteric surfactants, there may be used, for example, dimethylalkylbetaine and the like. In the case of using the antistatic agents, a fine line of adhesive can be easily obtained when the adhesive is extruded from the application machine. Examples of the optionally added additives include fillers and copolymerizable monomers. The fillers include, for example, carbon black, anhydrous or hydrous silicone dioxide, calcium carbonate, calcium silicate, magnesium carbonate, titanium oxide, zinc oxide, clay, alumina, talc and the like. The proportion of the filler is preferably 0 300 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the silicone polymer.Preferable examples of the polymerizable monomer are polyfunctional acrylate or methacrylate monomers, for example, polyethylene glycol diacrylate, polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,3butylene glycol diacrylate, 1,3 butylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,4 butylene glycol diacrylate, 1,4 butylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,6 hexane glycol diacrylate, 1,6 hexane glycol dimethacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate, neopentyl glycol dimethacrylate, dipropylene glycol diacrylate, dipropylene glycol dimethacrylate, polypropylene glycol diacrylate, polypropylene glycol dimethacrylate, 2, 2 bis 4 acryloxydiethoxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 4 methacryloxydiethoxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 4acryloxypropyldiphenyl propane, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate and the like.The proportion of the copolymerizable monomer is preferably 0 to 20 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the silicone polymer. The viscosity and other properties of the adhesive obtained may be varied depending upon the kind and proportion of the above additives added. The fluidity and other characteristics of the adhesive in the heatpressing and the elasticity, hardness and other characteristics of the adhesive after the heat pressing may also be varied depending upon the kind and amount of the additives added. The viscosity of the adhesive is preferably 1,000 to 5,000,000 cP more preferably 100,000 to 2,000,000 cP in view of the applicability of the adhesive and prevention of the adhesive from oozing through the cloth. Thus, the haircloth 4 having applied thereto the adhesive 3 is set while fitting the warp 7 of the haircloth 4 to the A B line on a base board 2, for example, the fixed base of a press which has usually the necessary concave and convex surface as shown in Fig. 6. Subsequently, the front bodice 6 is put on the haircloth 4 while fitting the warp 8 of the front bodice 6 to the line 7 as in Fig. 4. In this embodiment, the haircloth 4 is first put on the base board 2 and the front bodice 6 is then put on the haircloth 4, but in another embodiment, the front bodice 6 is first put on the base board as shown in Fig. 8 and the haircloth 4 is thereafter put on the front bodice 6 while fitting the points 10 as shown in Fig. 9.If necessary, the shoulder pad 5 having applied thereto the adhesive 3 is placed in the predetermined position under the haircloth 4 as in Fig. 5, whereby the preparatory working before basting is completed. When the warp of the cloth is adjusted to the A B line on the base board, the use of a photoelectric tube, for example, may facilitate the working. The resulting assembly consisting of the haircloth 4, the front bodice 6 and if neccessary, the shoulder pad 5 on the fixed base 2 of a press is heat pressed by means of the movable member 1 of the press at a predetermined temperature for example, 60 2000C, preferably 100 1500 C under a predetermined pressure for example, 2 2 0.01 2 kg cm , preferably 0.05 0.15 kg cm for a predetermined period of time for example, 1 600 sec, preferably 5 60 sec while applying steam thereto, thereby appropriately securing the haircloth 4, the front bodice 6 and if neccessary, the shoulder pad 5 to one another see Fig. 6 . Thus, the basting of interlining which is the most difficult step in the process for tailoring clothes can be carried out simply in a very short period of time by the present basting method regardless of the technical level of worker. The thus basted assembly consisting of haircloth 4, the front bodice 6 and if neccessary, the shoulder pad 5 is subjected to a conventional final sewing, after which the portions secured with the adhesive can easily be peeled off by lightly pulling the haircloth 4 and the front bodice 6 at the secured portions in the opposite direction without damaging the cloth.As a result, unpleasant appearance such as puckering resulting from the difference in shrinkage between the secured portion and the unsecured portion, said appearance being able to be visually recognized from the outside of the front bodice, can be removed. Moreover, since the adhesive is thermosetting, the adhesive once cured by heat pressing cannot secure again the front bodice to the interlining even when the suit is subjected to finishing press, and hence, no unpleasant appearance such as puckering results from the finishing press. In addition, the present basting method does not require the conventional step of withdrawing the basting threads, and hence, the disadvantages resulting from the said conventional step can be overcome by the present basting method. Though not shown in the drawings, the adhesive 3 may be applied to the front bodice 6 in stead of the haircloth 4, and the above procedure may be repeated. Further, a method of basting the facing is explained below. As shown in Fig. 10, the preparatory working for basting the facing in tailoring clothes includes the step of applying the thermosetting adhesive 3 to the margine to sew up 11 of the front bodice 6 at a position 0.1 5 mm distant, preferably 0.3 2 mm, distant from the final sewing line 9 for facing in the form of a solid line or broken line having a width of 0.1 1 mm in the case of broken line, the length and space can appropriately be selected , and setting the front bodice 6 having applied thereto the adhesive on a base board such as the fixed base of a press, putting the facing 12 on the front bodice 6 while fitting points on the facing 12 to the corresponding points on the front bodice 6 so as to give the necessary shirring amount as shown in, for example, Fig. 11, and heatpressing the resulting assembly by means of an iron or a press at a temperature of 60 2000C at a pressure of 2 0.01 2 kg cm for a peri6d of 1 600 seconds to secure the facing to the front bodice. Subsequently, the thus secured assembly is subjected to final sewing in a conventional manner. After the final sewing, the margines to sew up 11 and 13 of the front bodice and the facing are separated, and simultaneously, the secured portions are also easily peeled off see Fig. 12 . A further embodiment of the present basting method is the basting for the final sewing of back bodices 14 and 14 at the back center. As shown in Fig. 13, the thermosetting adhesive 3 is applied to the margine to sew up 15 of one of the back bodices 14 and 14 along the final sewing line 9 at the back center but 0.1 5 mm distant, preferably 0.3 2 mm distant, from said final sewing line 9 in the form of a solid line or broken line having a width of 0.1 1 mm.The back bodice 14 having applied thereto the adhesive is set on a flat board 2 such as the fixed base of a press, after which the other back bodice 14 is put thereon while fitting points on the two back bodices for preventing puckering from being caused and fitting the patterns of both back bodices 14 and 14 as shown in Fig. 14, and the resulting assembly is heatpressed by means of an iron or the movable member of the press at a temperature of 60 2000C at a pressure of 0.01 2 kg cm2 for a period of 1 600 seconds, thereby securing the two back bodices 14 and 14 at the back center line. The thus secured assembly is subjected to final sewing in a conventional manner, and then to separation of the margines, whereby the portions secured with the adhesive are easily peeled off see Fig. 15 .This basting method can also be applied to the final sewing of side piece and the front bodice or back bodice, to the final sewing of top sleeve and under sleeve, and to the final sewing of top side and under side of pantaloons. The basting of the back bodices with a thermosetting adhesive, particularly when it is applied to a thin cloth for summer suit, can prevent the slippage of cloth resulting from sewing by a sewing machine. As can be seen from the above description, the present basting method can give a product having a uniform and stable quality. Moreover, the present basting method can be applied to not only the basting of interlinings including attaching a shoulder pad but also all other basting septs in tailoring. By applying the present basting method, the sewing process can be partially automatized even in the case of tailoring summer suits, and can be shorted in time, whereby the quality of product and the production efficiency can be enhanced. The thermosetting adhesive comprising as the main component a liquid, addition reaction type silicone polymer can secure provisionally sheets of cloth at a considerably lower temperature under a considerably lower pressure than those for the conventional permanent adhesives to be used for securing sheets of cloth hot melt adhesives such as polyester, polyamides and the like .Therefore, the cloth is prevented from being damaged and the pressing time can be shortened. Accordingly, sheets of cloth can easily be secured by means of an iron, and the thus secured sheets of cloth can easily be peeled off, but the adhesive cannot secure the thus peeled sheets of cloth even when heat pressing is applied thereto again. This invention is further explained in detail below referring to Examples, but it should be interpreted that this invention should not be limited to the Examples.The Silicone A , Silicone B , Silicone C , Silicone D , Silicone E , Silicone F , and Silicone G used in theExamples are as follows, and the part used in the Examples is by weight unless otherwise specified Silicone A Polymethylvinylsiloxane, viscosity at 200C of 5,000 cP Silicone B Polymethylhydrogensiloxane, viscosity at 200C of 5,000 cP Silicone C Polymethylvinylsiloxane, viscosity at 200C of 3,000 cP Silicone D Polymethylhydrogensiloxane, viscosity at 200C of 3,000 cP Silicone E Polytrifluoropropylallylsiloxane, viscosity at 200C of 3,000 cP Silicone F Polytrifluoropropylhydrogensiloxane, viscosity at 200C of 3,000 cP Silicone G Polyphenylvinylsiloxane, viscosity at 200C of 2,000 cP.

Each of the adhesive thus obtained was applied to a piece of wool cloth for suit in the form of a line having a width of 2.5 mm and a thickness of 0.24 mm and a piece of haircloth was put thereon, after which the resulting assembly was heat pressed at a temperature of 2 120 C at a pressure of 0.15 kg cm for 30 sec. Thereafter, the pieces of cloth were drawn at an angle of 90 at a rate of 50 mm min to examine the necessary tensile force for peeling the pieces peeling strength .
