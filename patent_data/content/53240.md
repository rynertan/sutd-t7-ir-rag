# Process for manufacturing thin wall enbloc hollow metal bodies, useful for pressure containers and products so obtained.

## Abstract
A process for forming hollow bodies of metal materials, particularly of aluminium alloys, based on a suitable combination of mechanical operations comprising deep drawing, stretching, tapering and tool machining, whereby it is possible to obtain essentially cylindrical enbloc metal bodies with a concave dished bottom and a dome shaped head provided with a beaded opening, said enbloc bodies being characterized in that the cylinder walls are very thin, highly strain hardened and endowed with high mechanical properties, and therefore such as to attain, according to the object of the invention, a remarkable reduction in the metal material amount used in the aforesaid enbloc bodies, destined for being used chiefly as pressure containers, for example for aerosol.
