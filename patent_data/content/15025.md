# An automatic liquid sample supply apparatus and method and apparatus for flushing a delivery tube of the supply apparatus.

## Abstract
An automatic sample supply apparatus has a delivery tube 2 which aspirates liquid samples from sample contain ers mounted on a turntable 3 and delivers the sample to the dosing aperture of a graphite tube 1 of an atomic absorption spectrophotometer or to the sample input of other analytical instruments. The turntable 3 also carries a flushing dis charge container 9 which is of similar form to the sample container but has an aperture in the side wall. When the turntable 3 is indexed so that the delivery tube 2 enters the flushing discharge container 9 a solenoid valve 11 is opened to allow a flushing liquid from container 10 to flow through the tube 2 and into the container 9 . The aper ture in the wall of container 9 is dimensioned so that the flushing liquid will only flow through it when a given head of liquid exists above the top of the aperture.
