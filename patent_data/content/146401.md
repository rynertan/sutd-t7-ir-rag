# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR SUPPORTING TUBULAR POSTS

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method of supporting a road traffic sign post 20 in which a lower sleeve portion 22 of the post 20 is em bedded in the ground and secured therein by concrete 23 , an interference fit tubular adaptor 1, 11 is driven into the sleeve 22 to provide a predetermined length of adaptor extending from the sleeve and the upper post portion 21 driven into the projecting portion 3, 13 of the adaptor 1, 11 so that the upper end of the sleeve and lower end of the post are in an abut ting relationship. The adaptor 1, 11 is required to be weaker than the upper portion 21 of the post 20 in order that it will fracture or bend along a line between the abutting ends of the upper portion 21 and sleeve 20 in event of being hit, by for example, a car. The adaptor 1, 11 may have an outwardly di rected flange 4, 14 to determine the extent of penetration into the sleeve 22 and post 21 , and outwardly directed chevrons 15, 16 at the ends to provide lead in portions. The impact strength of the adaptor 1, 11 is predetermined by controlling its wall thickness or providing lines of weakness such as a groove or lines of holes 7 .
