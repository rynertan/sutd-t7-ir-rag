# METHOD OF FABRICATING FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTORS

## Abstract
A field effect transistor fabricating method comprises the steps of forming an impurity region 23 for a channel in a surface portion of a semiconductor substrate 22 forming a first material layer 30 which has a width substantially equal to that of a gate electrode in a position on said semiconduc tor substrate where said gate electrode is to be formed, a second material layer 28 which has a larger width than said first material layer 30 above said first material layer, and source and drain regions 29 by ion implantation using said first and second material layers 30, 28 as a mask forming source and drain electrodes 31 in contact with said source and drain regions 29 forming a third material layer 33 which has a selectivity with said first material layer 30 in its etching characteristics, on the semiconductor body thus far prepared forming at least an aperture by removing said first material layer 30 in using said third material layer 33 as a mask and forming said gate electrode 35 in said aperture.
