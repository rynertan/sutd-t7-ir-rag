# Method for producing a solid fuel for small furnaces and solid fuel produced thereby.

## Abstract
A method is described for preparing a solid fuel, in either powder or briquette form, for use in small furnaces. The fuel has a relatively uniform heating value of 12,000 14,000 Btu per pound and is prepared by crushing and grinding coal to less than 200 mesh and drying and oxidizing the coal with a hot gas containing a trace of oxygen to a dried moisture content of 1 15 . Selected quantities of additives having approximately the same fineness are combined with the coals to minimize the effects of sulfur, to improve combustion and ash properties, to maintain fluidity of the solid fuel in powder form, to inhibit moisture pick up, and to prevent auto ignition and spontaneous combustion during storage of the solid fuel.
