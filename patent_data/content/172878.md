## Description
This invention relates to a bipolar transistor fabricated by means of slot technology and, more particularly, relates to a bipolar transistor which has its active regions formed in slots. The density of integrated circuits continues to increase. Advances in lithography have permitted line width resolution to reach micron dimensions. And, processing techniques have improved to the point where the reliable formation of thin films and precise etching is possible so that smaller and more predictable feature sizes are being obtained. The lateral dimensions of devices are thus reaching micron levels and passing on into nanometer ranges. Thus, a greater number of individual devices can be fabricated in a given area. While further increases in areal density are likely, physical, equipment and process limits are being approached. In addition, as devices become smaller and smaller their power ratings are reduced and the relative importance of problems such as parasitic capacitance and contamination is increased. Due to the diminishing return to be obtained from efforts in improving areal density, it has become desirable to consider the possibility of increasing the extent of the active regions in the vertical dimension to thereby obtain performance for a device with established lateral dimensions which is equivalent to the performance of a device with greater lateral dimensions. Also, higher power or higher performance devices may be obtained in this way. Bipolar transistors typically have a vertical structure. As shown in the prior art of Fig. 1, the conventional bipolar transistor has an emitter 14 formed in a base region 13 which is in contact with a collector region 21. The device depicted is an npn transistor. Conduction of carriers across the pn junctions occurs over the full areal extent of the junctions. However, since the junctions are primarily horizontally disposed most of the carriers traverse a vertical or near vertical path. The vertical character of the carrier flow is enhanced by the presence of n buried collector 15 which takes away any lateral component of carrier flow that would result if the current flowed from base 13 through the bulk of collector 21 directly to collector contact region 12 and collector contact 16. Carrier flow, then, is from the emitter 14 to the base 13 across the junction 20 and between the base 13 and n buried collector 15 across the junction 22 and thence to collector contact region 12 and collector contact 16. As the densities of bipolar integrated circuits increase, the horizontal component of the two junctions decreases compared to the vertical component as the overall junction area decreases. This in turn reduces , the gain of the transistor, and generally reduces performance by increasing parasitic capacitance, both undesirable consequences. As the densities of integrated circuits have increased, there has been serious consideration of using trench or slot formation processes for forming the insulating zones between individual transistors in lieu of the conventional pn junction region 11 in prior art Fig. 1 and local oxidation LOCOS structures. See, e.g., D. N. K. Wang et al., Reactive Ion Etching Eases Restrictions on Materials and Feature Sizes , IBM Technical disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 23, No. 3, August 1990, at page 1089, discloses a method of producing a lateral transistor, with a high current gain and high switching speeds. The present invention provides an integrated circuit structure comprising a bipolar transistor formed in a semiconductor substrate, said transistor comprising The invention also provides a method of forming an integrated circuit structure comprising a bipolar transistor formed in slots in a semiconductor substrate including For a more complete understanding of the bipolar transistor of the present invention, reference may be had to the accompanying drawings which are incorporated herein by reference and in which The active area of a transistor is determined by the size of the emitter. As lateral dimensions are reduced, it is only possible to increase this area for a given cross sectional size by increasing the vertical dimension of the device. A bipolar transistor having an enhanced vertical dimension also may have a performance very close to the theoretical maximum due to the low levels of the critical components of parasitic capacitance. For example, in most circuit applications the collector to base capacitance CCB and the collector to substrate capacitance CCS are important parameters in determining device performance. In vertical bipolar transistors of the prior art, as shown in Fig. 1, the physical collector is much larger than the active collector region in order to make effective electrical contact. With the slot structure of the present invention, however, the physical collector size is virtually equal to the active collector and the physical base is virtually equal to the active base thereby reducing the related parasitic capacitances CCB and CCS to their minimums. The base to collector capacitance CBE is larger due to the increased base doping allowed by the use of a SIPOS emitter fortunately, CBE is not a critical determinant of speed in most bipolar circuits. These various characteristics are set out in Table 1 which compares the state of the art IMOX process transistor, a transistor produced by the proprietary IMOX PROCESS of Advanced Micro Devices see AMD Handbook,, Various configurations for the slot transistor structure of the present invention are shown in cross section in Figs. 2a, 3a and 4a. The common structural feature is that the emitter and collectors are formed in slots. In Fig. 2a an emitter slot 26 is shown to be fabricated in spaced apart relationship from a collector slot 27. A base region 28 is diffused into semiconductor substrate 25 adjacent emitter slot 26. In the embodiment of Fig. 2a, a diffusion barrier 29 has been formed along the left hand wall of emitter slot 26 so that there is no diffusion into the left hand side of the substrate 25 adjacent emitter slot 26. Carrier conduction will be from left to right, i.e., from the conductive SIPOS filling not shown in emitter slot 26 through base region 28 and into the SIPOS filled not shown collector slot 27. SIPOS Semi Insulating Polycrystalline silicon may be doped to be a conductive material suitable for functioning as the active regions in transistors as described, for example, in T. Matsushita et al., A SIPOS Si Heterojunction Transistor , Another structure in accordance with the present invention is shown in cross section in Fig. 4a. Here, an elongated emitter slot 32 is shown to have collector slots 33 formed in parallel spaced apart relationship. As seen from the plan view of Fig. 4b, the emitter slot 32 is shaped in the form of a cross with the collector slot 33 being formed around it in congruent relationship. Typical widths for the slots in the various embodiments will be .1 to .3 µm for the base, 1 to 1.5 µm for the collector slot and 1 to 1.5 µm for the emitter slot. The slot depths will vary depending upon application but will be in the range of 5µm to 30µm. A process for fabricating the structure of the present invention is shown in the series of Figs. 5 13. In Fig. 5, isolation slots 40 are shown to be formed in a semiconductor substrate 44. Prior to formation of the slots an n buried diffusion layer 39 has been formed in substrate 44 and an n type epitaxial layer 38 has been grown on the surface of n buried layer 39. The n buried layer 39 serves to reduce series resistance in the collector contact as described subsequently, particularly with respect to Figs. 12 and 13. The isolation slots will extend through pn junction 36 formed between n layer 39 and p type substrate 44 in order to isolate the bipolar transistor to be formed from adjacent transistors fabricated in the same integrated circuit. For the purpose of this specification, the ensuing description will be of a silicon substrate with masking and filler materials which are compatible chemically and metallurgically. The structure of the present invention may also be fabricated in III V compounds with those masking and filler materials being used which are known in the art to be appropriate to the particular III V material. In the isolation slots 40 of Fig. 5 a thin silicon dioxide layer 37 is grown over the entire interior surface. This layer accomplishes the electrical isolation. Then, a filler material 40 is applied as shown in Fig. 6. The filler material is selected from the classes of conductive and insulating materials including such materials as silicon nitride, SIPOS, polycrystalline silicon, metal oxides, silicon, silicon dioxide, etc. The material must readily flow into the slots or deposit on the surface of the slot, preferably in an isotropic fashion. The choice of filler material will generally reflect the desire to have a material which has the same coefficient of thermal expansion as the surrounding silicon in order to avoid thermal stress. Thus, either polycrystalline silicon or SIPOS are the preferred filler materials as they have the same coefficient of thermal expansion as the surrounding silicon. For the isolation slots the actual isolation is accomplished by the thin silicon dioxide layer 37 formed around the interior surface of the bare slot. For the active regions such as emitter 46 and collectors 45 the slot will be filled with heavily doped SIPOS. Typically, the slot is overfilled and the surface of the material is planarized by an isotropic etch such as a fluorinated plasma. The slots are formed, for example, by reactive ion etch equipment, preferably with a chemically active species so that physical and chemical etching steps are combined. See, e.g., D. N. K. Wang et al., Reactive Ion Etching Eases Restrictions on Materials and Feature Sizes , As shown in Fig. 6, the slot regions and portions of the interior region in which the active device is to be formed are covered with a stop layer 43 of a material such as silicon dioxide or silicon nitride. This serves to open up a central region 39 in which an emitter slot is to be formed and to protect adjacent regions 38 where collector slots are to be formed. This approach is of the Differential Etch Stop Process type described and claimed in the copending application of R. Bower, Latent Image Slot Process , filed on even date herewith it permits self aligned slots to be formed on a semiconductor substrate. The layer of polycrystalline silicon 42 overlies stop etch layer 43 and reaches down onto the surface of substrate 44 within region 39. Then, as shown in Fig. 7, a layer 49 of silicon dioxide is applied over the layer of polycrystalline silicon 42. The layers are patterned to define a first type slot region 46 where emitter slots are to be formed and second type slot regions 45 where collector slots are to be formed. The slot regions are self aligned as described in detail in the copending application referenced above. The slot regions are etched down to the silicon substrate in the case of emitter type slot region 46 and down to the stop region 45 in the case of collector type slot region 45. The etch will have selective properties so that stop layer 43 is not penetrated. See, e.g., L. M. Ephrath, Reactive Ion Etching for VLSI , Next, as shown in Fig. 8, the emitter type slot is shown to be partially formed. The dotted line 46 shows the full extent of the slot when it is completely formed whereas the solid line 47 shows the bottom extent of the partially formed slot. Then an oxidizing step is carried out to produce oxidized regions 52b at the exposed edges of the polycrystalline silicon layer 42 and at the exposed edges of the partially formed emitter slot within the silicon substrate 44. Oxidized regions 48 serve to isolate the base contact regions 51 from the active emitter region 46 shown in Figs. 10 and 11. Oxidized regions 52b prevent any dopant incorporated in polycrystalline silicon layer 42 from electrically altering the filler material placed in collector slot 45 . In a preferred embodiment, the oxidized regions 52a for the collector region 45 are also formed at this time so as to ensure that the base contacts 51 touch neither the active collector 45 or the active emitter 46 . In order to accomplish this result it is necessary to partially form collector slots 45 so that the upper sidewalls of the slots are exposed during the oxidation step and the exposed silicon is converted to silicon dioxide. Most preferably, the oxidized regions 52a have a lower vertical extent than the oxidized regions 48 to ensure that, in the case of misalignment, there is no contact between the active collector 45 and base contact region 51. In the embodiment shown in the figures, the oxidized regions 52a are formed after the base contact regions 51, a practice which is permissible if the slots are self aligned. In the embodiment of the figures the next step, shown in Fig. 9, is the complete formation of the emitter slot 46 . Then, a standard diffusion step is used to produce the base region 50 adjacent the exposed surfaces of empty slot 46 . Alternately, the emitter slot may be filled with SIPOS having multiple dopants with differential rates of diffusion, e.g., with B and As. Since boron diffuses more rapidly than As, it may be driven into the surrounding silicon, leaving, e.g., an n type As doped emitter and a p type B doped base. A contact to base region 50 may be formed in a subsequent step by driving a dopant into the upper regions of the base region 50 from the portion of layer 42 adjacent oxidized regions 48. As shown in Fig. 10, the base contact regions 51 may also be formed during the process of driving in the diffusion which produces base region 50 provided that suitable dopant is contained within polycrystalline silicon layer 42. The emitter slot 46 is then filled with a suitable filler material such as SIPOS, as described above, to produce an active emitter slot region 46 , shown in Fig. 11 and following. The collector slots 45 are then partially formed as shown in Fig. 11. In contrast to the preferred embodiment, discussed above, the isolation regions 52a are then produced by an oxidation step which oxidizes the portions of the n type epitaxial layer 38 which are exposed at the upper edges of the slot. These regions serve to isolate the active collector regions 45 to be formed from base contact regions 51. Finally, the collector slot regions 45 are fully formed as shown in Fig. 12. Oxidized regions 52b which were formed at the same time as oxidized regions 48 see Fig. 8 serve to keep any doping in polycrystalline silicon layer 42 from altering the electrical properties of the filler material placed in active collector region 45 . The completed device is shown in Fig. 13. Then, contacts are formed to the respective regions. Since the slots may be much longer than they are wide see the rectilinear shape of emitter slot 30 of Fig. 3b and the cross shape of emitter slot 32 of Fig. 4b , a contact can be made at a single point or at several points, providing the series resistance to the full volume of the regions is tolerable. The contact resistance to the collector region may be reduced by an n buried collector 54 which ties active collector regions 45 together as shown in Fig. 13. This buried collector 54 is formed by that part of the n layer 39 which is bounded by isolation slots 40 , 37. As shown in the cross sectional drawings of Figs. 10 13, the base region 50 has already been contacted by contact regions 51. Now, external contacts are made to base, emitter and collector regions. These are applied once the active regions of the transistor are fully formed as shown in Fig. 13. Since slots are used for the active elements of the transistor of the present invention, it is convenient to also fabricate slots to isolate the transistor structure since the same process steps may be employed. Various slot isolation schemes are feasible for use in conjunction with the slot transistor structure of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 14, a third type slot, isolation slot 65, is used in conjunction with the emitter slot 63 and the collector slots 64. As seen in the plan view of Fig. 15, the isolation slots fully surround the transistor structure. Preferably, they will be self aligned as described in the co pending application of R. Bower, Process for Forming Slots of Different Types in Self Aligned Relationship Using a Latent Image Mask , filed on even date herewith. Preferably also, the isolation slots 65 will extend through a pn junction separating n type epitaxial layer 62 and p type substrate 61. Alternately, for more compact structures, the collector slot 68 may be formed in a portion of previously formed slot 72 in an integrated isolation scheme. As shown in Fig. 16, slot 72 is formed first in the substrate region 67. Then, a thin layer of insulating material such as silicon dioxide has been formed, for example, by thermal oxide growth, around the interior surface of oversized slot 72. After being filled with an insulating filler material 71, a smaller slot 68 has been formed within slot 72 in a manner to not disturb the oxide coating of the outer wall. Electrical isolation from adjacent devices is provided by the insulating layer 70 remaining on the outer wall of slot 72. The transistor structure functions as described above once a base region not shown is formed around the emitter formed in slot 69. Since the principle of bipolar slot transistors is to increase the vertical extent of the active regions and allow lateral dimensions to be reduced, a practical concern for commercial devices will be the making of electrical contacts to each of the slot regions. The narrowness of the slots makes contact difficult. In addition, in order to avoid high spreading resistance, it will be desired to contact the full extent of the slot or to contact the slot at numerous points along its extent. Numerous contact schemes are shown in Figs. 18 24. In Fig. 18 advantage is taken of the use of a buried collector. Thus, it is possible to contact active collector regions 45 by strip 79 at the ends of its U shaped slot. No significant spreading resistance occurs because of the presence of the buried collector 54 which ties the collector volume together as shown in Fig. 13. The active emitter region 46 is small so that no appreciable spreading resistance is produced by contacting it by layer 80 at an edge, especially since strip 80 contacts almost the complete top of the emitter surface. The base contact is accomplished by base contact layer 42 which runs underneath strip 80 and is separated by insulating layer 49, shown in Fig. 20. In general, it is feasible to contact the closely arrayed bases and emitters because stacked conductive contacts are used with intervening insulating layers. In Fig. 21 another scheme for contacting the transistor structure of Fig. 18 is shown. Collector contact 82 contacts the back side of the U shaped active collector region 45 . Emitter contact layer 83 substantially covers the surface of active emitter region 46 and is accessible at one side of the transistor structure. The base contact layer 84 contacts substantially all of the base region 50. Here, the emitter contact layer 83 underlies the base contact layer and is separated by an insulating layer of the type shown in Fig. 20. Contact schemes for embodiments of the present invention which employ integrated isolation are shown in Figs. 22 24. In Fig. 22 the U shaped active collector region 87 is formed in the inside of collector slot 88. The active emitter region 86 and the base region 85 are formed, as shown for example in Fig. 16. Contact layer 82 contacts an edge of active collector region 87. No appreciable spreading resistance is experienced due to the use of a buried collector not shown . Base contact layer 93 contacts substantially all of base region 85. Emitter contact layer 94 contacts a substantial portion of active emitter region 86. As shown, base contact layer 93 overlies emitter contact layer 94 the two layers are separated by an insulating layer not shown in the manner shown previously in Fig. 20. In Fig. 23 an integrated isolation scheme involving spaced apart parallel collectors and emitters is shown. Here, active collector region 102 is formed in spaced apart parallel relationship with active emitter region 103. The base region 104 is located adjacent the length of emitter 103. As shown in the cross sectional view of Fig. 24, emitter contact 99 extends down to reach active emitter region 103 and extends to one side over the intervening layers of silicon dioxide 49 and polycrystalline silicon 42. Similarly, in mirror image fashion, collector contact 97 makes contact with active collector region 102 and extends away to the opposite side over silicon dioxide layer 49 and polycrystalline silicon layer 42. Base contact layer 98 extends in an orthogonal direction but reaches down to contact base 104 over the extent of the base. Base contact layer 98 is kept electrically insulated from collector contact layer 97 and emitter contact layer 99 by means of an intervening insulating layer not shown . In order to avoid an emitter base short, insulating regions 105 have been formed within the filler material in isolation slots 100 and 101. These isolation zones prevent contact between the emitter contact layer 99 and base region 104. The oval regions 106 and 107 are oxidized zones formed as described above with respect to Figs. 5 13 in similar fashion they serve to prevent shorting between active regions. It should be noted that many contact schemes are feasible. The approaches shown in Figs. 18 24 are illustrative only.
