# 4 2 Pyridylamino phenylacetic acid derivatives, process for their preparation, pharmaceuticals containing these compounds and their use.

## Abstract
The invention relates to novel 4 2 pyridylamino phenylacetic acid derivatives of the formula I Wherein R₁ is hydrogen, a halogen, a lower alkyl having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or nitro, R₂ is hydrogen, a halogen, or a lower alkyl having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, R₃ is hydrogen, a halogen, or a lower alkyl having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, R₄ is hydrogen or a lower alkyl having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, R₅ is hydrogen or CH₂CH₂OR₆ wherein R₆ is lower alkyl having 2 or 3 carbon atoms and being substituted with 1 or 2 hydroxy groups, provided that R₁ or R₂ is not 4 halogen, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, a process for their preparation e.g. 2 4 2 pyridylamino pehnyl prop ionic acid compound A is prepared by reacting methyl 2 4 amino phenyl propionate with 2 chloropyridine, followed by hydrolysis , pharmaceutcial composition containing these compounds, and their use as anti inflammatory and analgesic agents. They have excellent anti inflammatory and analgesic activities with an extremely weak ulcerogenicity in the gas trointestinal tract. Some of the compounds have superior inhibitory activity against chronic inflammation mediated by cellular immunity. In the figure the prophylactic effect on adjuvant induced arthritis in rats is shown vehicle control line 1 , reference compound Ibuprofen line 2 , new compound A line 3 .
