## Description
Synthesis of large crystal zeolite ZSM 5The present invention relates to a method for producing large crystal zeolite ZSM 5 and more particularly to a method for reproducibly controlling the crystal size of same.Zeolite ZSM 5 is a relatively new zeolite which in its conventionally synthesized aluminosilicate form has the following composition expressed in terms of mole ratios of oxides in the anhydrous state 0.9 0.2 N2 fl0 A1203 xSi02 wherein M is selected from the group consisting of a mixture of tetraalkylammonium cations, the alkyl groups of which contain 2 5 carbon atoms, and alkali metal cations, especially sodium, and x is at least 5, said cations having the valence n. ZSM 5 has a distinctive X ray diffraction pattern which further identifies it from other known zeolites. The original alkali metal cations of ZSM 5 can be exchanged by ion exchange with other ions to form species of the zeolite which have exceptional catalytic properties. Zeolite ZSM 5 and its conventional preparation are the subject of U.S. Patent 3,702,886.That patent discloses an average particle diameter of less than 1 2 micron. By the present invention there is obtained an average particle diameter between about 1 and 100 microns, i.e. large crystal ZSM 5, wherein by adjustment of process variables, specifically the OH SiO2 molar ratio and TMA SiO2 molar ratio, crystal size can be reproducibly controlled. Further, the TMA ion may be replaced by a mixed alkylammonium ion wherein at least one group is methyl and the other three may be hydrogen or C2 to C5 alkyl hydrocarbons. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a method for reproducibly controlling the crystal size of large crystal ZSM 5 having an average particle diameter between about 1 and 100 microns, and having the following formula in the exercise of this invention in terms of mole ratios of oxides 0 20 M20 0 20 A1203 100Si02 wherein M is at least one cation. M can be an alkali metal, e.g. sodium, and tetraalkylammonium cations, including tetramethylammonium TMA . Reproducible control is achieved by adjusting the initial OH Si02 and TMA SiO2 mole ratios to critical values simultaneously in the large crystal forming reaction mixture.Figure 1 shows the effect of OH Si02 ratio on effective ZSM5 crystal size Figure 2 shows the effect of TMA SiO2 ratio on effectiveZSM 5 crystal size.The reaction composition is for mole ratios always in the order Si02 A1203 H20 Si02 OH Si02 Na Si02 TPA Si02 TMA SiO2. Zeolite ZSM 5 has been conventionally prepared by forming a mixture of alumina, silica, alkali metal oxide, water and tetraalkylammonium compounds such that the mixture has a composition, in terms of mole ratios of oxides, falling within the following range A1203 Si02 0 0.2 H20 Si02 5 200 OH Si02 0.07 10.0 M Si02 .01 3.0 R SiO2 .01 1.0 Wherein M is an alkali metal ion and R is a tetraalkylammonium cation, the alkyl groups of which contain 2 5 carbon atoms.In addition tetramethylammonium ions TMA have been present in a TMA SiO2 ratio of 0.01 0.5. The reaction mixture is maintained at a temperature of from about 1000F 380C to about 4000F 2040C until crystals of ZSM 5 are formed.Zeolite ZSM 5 possesses a definite distinguishing crystalline structure whose X ray diffraction pattern shows the following significant lines TABLE IInterplanar Spacing d A Relative Intensity 11.1 0.3 S 10.0 0.3 S 7.4 0.2 W 7.1 0.2 W 6.3 0.2 W 6.04 0.2 W 5.56 0.1 W 5.01 0.1 W 4.60 0.08 W 4.25 0.08 W 3.85 0.07 VS 3.71 0.05 S 3.04 0.03 W 2.99 0.02 W 2.94 0.02 WThese values were determined by standard technique. The radiation was the K alpha doublet of copper, and a scintillation counter spectrometer with a strip chart pen recorder was used.The peak heights, I, and the positions as a function of 2 times theta, where theta is the Bragg angle, were read from the spectrometer chart From these, the relative intensities, 100I I where 10 is the intensity of 0, the strongest line or peak, and d obs , the interplanar spacing in A, corresponding to the recorded lines, were calculated. In Table I the relative intensities are given in terms of the symbols W Weak, S Strong and VS Very Strong.It should be understood that this X ray diffraction pattern is characteristic of all the species of ZSM 5 zeolites. Ion exchange of the sodium ion with cations reveals substantially the same pattern with some minor shifts in interplanar spacing and variation in relative intensity. Other minor variations can occur depending on the silicon to aluminum ratio of the particular sample, as well as if it has been subjected to thermal treatment.In the present method of preparing a large crystal ZSM 5 crystalline zeolite, a reaction mixture is prepared comprising sources of alkali metal, alumina, silica, organic nitrogencontaining cations, and water, as before, except that theOH SiO2 ratio is controlled between 0.01 and 0.5 and preferably between 0.01 and 0.20, and the TMA Si02 ratio is controlled between about 0.01 and 1.0, preferably 0.01 and 0.5.It has been found earlier that crystal size increases as theOH Si02 ratio decreases.In another embodiment of the invention, the TMA ion may be replaced by a mixed alkylammonium ion, RÚ, RÚÚ, RÚÚÚ CH3N, wherein at least one of the group R1, R11, R111 is hydrogen or a C2 C5 alkyl hydrocarbon and the remaining groups are methyl.The reaction mixture is maintained at a temperature of from about 1000F 380C to about 5000F 2600C for a period of time of from about 1 hour to about 180 days until crystals of ZSM 5 are formed. A more preferred temperature range is from about 1800F 820C to about 350 S 1770C for a period of time at a temperature within such preferred range being from about 2 hours to about 30 days.It is recalled that in calculating the mole ratio of hydroxide ions silica, it is conventional to calculate hydroxide by summing moles of OH , whether added as NaOH, as quarternary ammonium hydroxide in the case of a conventional preparation , as sodium silicate NaOH Si02 , as sodium aluminate NaOH A1203 , or the like, and to subtract from that sum any moles of acid added. Acid may be added simply as HC1, Hun03 H2S04 acetic acid, and the like, or it may be added as aluminum sulfate A1203 H2S04 , chloride A1203 HC1 , nitrate A1203 HN03 , etc. Each mole of A1203 is itself equivalent to 2 moles of acid in this calculation, since Awl 203 consumes 2 moles of hydroxide in its conversion to framework aluminate ion. In particular, no contribution is assigned to organic bases such as amines in this calculation.Amines present in reaction mixtures having an OH Si02 ratio of 0.01 are protonated when further acid is added. Until said additional acid exceeds the amine present, the pH remains above 7.The digestion of the gel particles is carried out until crystals form. The solid product is separated from the readtion medium, as by cooling the whole to room temperature, filtering and water washing.The composition for the synthesis of synthetic ZSM 5 can be prepared utilizing materials which can supply the appropriate oxide. Such materials include aluminates, alumina, silicates, silica hydrosol, silica gel, silicic acid and hydroxides.It will be understood that each oxide component utilized in the reaction mixture for preparing ZSM 5 can be supplied by one or more essential reactants and they can be mixed together in any order. For example, any oxide.can be supplied by an aqueous solution, sodium hydroxide or by an aqueous solution of a suitable silicate the organic nitrogen containing cation can be supplied by a compound of that cation, such as, for example, a salt. The reaction mixture can be prepared either batchwise or continuously. Crystal size and crystallization time of the ZSM 5 composition will vary with the nature of the reaction mixture employed.In the present preferred case in order to control the large crystal ZSM 5 zeolite the ON SiO2 ratio will be controlled between 0.01 and 0.20, and the TNA SiO2 will be controlled between 0.01 and 0.50 obtaining crystals having an average particle size diameter between about 1 and 100 microns, depending on the value of the two ratios.The ZSM 5 compOsition as prepared hereby has the characteristicX ray diffraction pattern of conventionally prepared ZSM 5, the values of which are set forth in Table I.Even though the presently prepared ZSM 5 can often have a low amount of alkali metal, e.g. sodium ions, as synthesized, and therefore can be utilized as catalytic material for a number of hydrocarbon conversion reactions substantially as synthesized, the original cations of the as synthesized ZSM5 can be replaced in accordance with techniques well known in the art, at least in part, by ion exchange with other cations. Preferred replacing cations include metal ions, ammonium ions, hydrogen ions and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred cations are those which render the zeolite catalytically active especially for hydrocarbon conversion.These include hydrogen, rare earth metals, aluminum, metals of Groups IIA, IIIB, IVB, VIB, VIII, IB, IIB, IIIA, IVA. Of the replacing metallic cations, particular preference is given to cations of metals such as rare earth, Mn, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cd, Pd, Ni, Co, Ti, Al, Sn, Fe and Co. A typical ion exchange technique would be to contact the synthetic ZSM 5 zeolite after calcination with a solution of a salt of the desired replacing cation or cations. Although a wide variety of salts can be employed, particular preference is given to chlorides, nitrates and sulfates.Representative ion exchange techniques are disclosed in a wide variety of patents including United States Patents 3,140,249 3,140,251 and 3,140,253.Following contact with the salt solution of the desired replacing cation, the zeolite is then preferably washed with water and dried at a temperature ranging from 1500F 660C to about 6000F 3160C and thereafter may be calcined in air or an inert gas at temperatures ranging from about 5000F 2600C to 15000F 8160C for periods of time ranging from 1 to 48 hours or more to produce a catalytically active thermal decomposition product thereof.Regardless of form of the ZSM 5, the spatial arrangement of the aluminum, silicon and oxygen atoms which form the basic crystal lattices of ZSM 5 remains essentially unchanged by the described replacement of the original cations as determined by taking an X ray powder diffraction pattern of the ionexchanged material.The hereby prepared zeolite ZSM 5 may be used in the conversion of a wide variety of organic compounds, e.g. hydrocarbon compounds and oxygenates such as methanol. Such processes include, for example alkylation of aromatics with olefins, aromatization of normally gaseous olefins and paraffins, aromatization of normally liquid low molecular weight paraffins and olefins, isomerization of aromatics, paraffins and olefins, disproportionation of aromatics, transalkylation of aromatics, oligomerization of olefins and cracking and hydrocracking. All of the foregoing catalytic processes are of value since they result in upgrading of the organic charge being processed. The special catalytic advantages of large crystal size are illustrated in U.S.Patent 4,117,026 for example.Synthetic ZSM 5 zeolites prepared in accordance hereto can be used either in the organic nitrogen containing or alkali metal form and hydrogen form or another univalent or multivalent cationic form. They can also be used in intimate combination with a hydrogenating component such as tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum, rhenium, nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, or a noble metal such as platinum or palladium where a hydrogenation dehydrogenation function is to be performed. Such components can be exchanged into the composition, impregnated therein or physically intimately admixed therewith. Such components can be impregnated in or on to ZSM 5 such as, for example, by, in the case of platinum, treating the zeolite with a platinum metal containing ion.Thus, suitable platinum compounds for this purpose include chloroplatinic acid, platinous chloride and various compounds containing the platinum amine complex. Combinations of metals and methods for their introduction can also be used.In the case of many catalysts, it is desired to incorporate the ZSM 5 hereby prepared with another material resistant to the temperatures and other conditions employed in organic conversion processes. Such matrix materials include active and inactive materials and synthetic or naturally occurring zeolites as well as inorganic materials such as clays, silica and or metal oxides. The latter may be either naturally occurring or in the form of gelatinous precipitates, sols or gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides. Use of a material in conjunction with the ZSM 5, i.e. combined therewith, which is active, tends to improve the conversion and or selectivity of the catalyst in certain organic conversion processes.Inactive materials suitably serve as diluents to control the amount of conversion in a given process so that products can be obtained economically and orderly without employing other means for controlling the rate of reaction. Frequently, zeolite materials have been incorporated into naturally occurring clays, e.g. bentonite and kaolin. These materials, i.e. clays, oxides, etc., function, in part, as binders for the catalyst. It is desirable to provide a catalyst having good crush strength, because in a petroleum refinery the catalyst is often subjected to rough handling, which tends to break the catalyst down into powder like materials which cause problems in processing.Naturally occurring clays which can be composited with the hereby synthesized ZSM 5 catalyst include the montmorillonite and kaolin family, which familes include the sub bentonites, and the kaolins commonly known as Dixie, McNasme, Georgia and Florida clays or others in which the main mineral constituent is halloysite, kaolinite, dickite, nacrite, or anauxite. Such clays can be used in the raw state or initially subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chemical modification. In addition to the foregoing materials, the ZSM 5 catalyst hereby synthesized can be composited with a porous matrix material such as silica alumina, silica magnesia, silicazirconia, silica thoria, silica beryllia, silica titania as well as ternary compositions such as silica alumina thoria, silica alumina zirconia, silica alumina magnesia and silicamagnesia zirconia. The matrix can be in the form of a cogel. A mixture of these components could also be used.The relative proportions of finely divided crystalline aluminosilicate ZSN 5 and inorganic oxide gel matrix vary widely with the crystalline aluminosilicate content ranging from about 1 to about 90 percent by weight and more usually in the range of about 10 to about 70 percent by weight of the composite.In order to more fully illustrate the nature of the invention and the manner of practicing same, the following examples are presented.In the examples below, an exercise of the effect of OH Si02 and TMA Si02 ratio on effective crystal size in ZSM 5 synthesis was performed using as variables the following mole ratios of reaction mixture components 1600C with stirring SiO2 A1203 Na Si 02 H20 SiO2 TPA SiO2 OH SiO2 TMA SiO2Unless noted all experiments used Q brand sodium silicate, Al2 S04 3.16H20, H2S04, and TPA Br.Table 2 summarizes the effect of TMA Si02 ratio on effective crystal size at one fixed OH Si02 mole ratio whereas Table 3 summarizes the effect of OH Si02 mole ratio on effective crystal size at one fixed TMA Si02 mole ratio.
