# Method and apparatus for detecting hydrogen, oxygen and water vapor concentrations in a host gas.

## Abstract
Sound waves are generated in a sonic cell and prop agated through a gas to a sensor which is coupled to a microcomputer. A gas mixture is first directed into a chamber and the attenuation and transit time of sound waves are calculated. Then, a calibrated gas is directed into the chamber, and the attenuation and transit time are again calculated. With these measurements, the microcomputer calculates the concentrations of at last two gaseous consti tuents such as hydrogen and water vapor, in the gas mixture. The microcomputer acts also as a control for operating valves and heater coils in response to pressure and tempera ture sensors coupled with the chamber.
