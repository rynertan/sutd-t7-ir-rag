# Preparation of cloning vectors for use in streptomyces, escherichia coli and related organisms.

## Abstract
The invention provides recombinant DNA cloning vectors comprising a functional origin of replication containing restric tion fragment of plasmid pFJ258, and one or more DNA seg ments that convey resistance to at least one antibiotic when transformed into a sensitive E. coli or Streptomyces restriction less host cell that is susceptible to transformation, cell division, and culture.
