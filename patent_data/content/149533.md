# Apparatus for receiving super high frequency signals.

## Abstract
Apparatus for receiving super high frequency signals comprises an outdoor unit 2 which includes a converter 8 for converting super high frequency signals received by an antenna 1 to ultra high frequency signals, a local oscillator 9L, 9H for generating a local signal supplied to the converter 8 , a switch 14 for switching the frequency of the local signal, and a detecting circuit 15 for detecting an operating voltage supplied to the outdoor unit 2 and the value of which is changed according to a band range of the super high frequency signals, the output of the detecting circuit 15 controlling the switch 14 an indoor unit 4 which includes a demodulator 23 for generating the operating voltage and a coaxial cable 3 for supplying the ultra high frequency signals from the outdoor unit 2 to the indoor unit 4 and also supplying the operating voltage from the indoor unit 4 to the outdoor unit 2 .
