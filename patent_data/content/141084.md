## Description
VACUUM CLEANER DEVICE ACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present nvention relates to surface cleaning apparatus and sore particularly to vacuum cleaner devices. Upright va ums typically and normally include a floor sweeping portion and an upright handle which houses or carries a collecting bag. so prior vacuum have a sweeper portion that uses a separate frame to which a brush motor, wheels and the like RTI ID 1.20 are mounted. A separate cover is used to conceal and protect the various parts mounted on the frame. Other uprights use a single diecast housing to which the various members are mounted. Such diecast housings must be drilled after the casting process to provide mounting apertures for the various components. Soie diecast housings have internal structures that are cast simultaneously with the housing. such as vacuum chan nel walls and the like. One problem experienced with such housings is that these internal structures produce excessive wear on the diecast molds which necessitates repeated and expensive repairs to the molds. Hence such internal structures are often avoided and components are used instead. Vacuums which have a metal frame or housing present h hazard of electrical shock if conductor contacts the franc or housing. Conversely, a metals associated thermal conductivity assists in reducing the incidents of overheating. Another problem experienced in prior art vacuums that utilize a roller or beater brush is that of vacuum leaks at the drive end of the brash chamber. sane drive ans lust extend fran the motor into the brush chamber, and the greater the degree of air leakage around the drive means the less efficiently the vacuum operates. It is therefore desirable that a vacuum cleaning device be lightweight and easily manufactured with a lini lul amount of manufacturing process steps. It is also d sirable that the vacuum cleaner operate with a high degree of efficiency while protecting against hazards to the operator. SUMMARY or THE INVENTION The vacuum cleaner of the present invention includes a unitary, structural foal housing with a brush chamber and a vacuum passage channel integrally molded within the housing. Also integrally molded are leans for nounting a motor, means for mounting wheel axles and means for mounting an electrical control leans. The housing simultaneously provides a structural main frame and cover to which the motor1 wheel axles and electrical control means can be mounted.The structural foam housing mav also have vacuum channel side walls which extend downwardly, so that a closed vacuum passage can be effected by simply securing a cover over the channel walls. In one aspect of the invention, the housing has an upwardly opening niation opening located above and generally adjacent the motor. Spaced raised posts on the housing upper surface surround the ventilator opening0 and cover is mounted on the lands to leave generally open spaces which allow the air heated by the motor to flow through the ventilator opening. In another aspect of the invention, a brush cham ber gasket seals the end wall aperture, and includes a mounting flange and a sealing flange having a receiving aperture for the driven end of the brush. The housing has a flange mounting surface oriented adjacent the end wall so that the sealing flange and mounting flange form an angle greater than the angle between the mounting surface and end wall. The sealing flange is therefore forced tightly against the end wall. In another aspect of the invention, the electrical circuitry ans for controlling the motor is mounted on an electrical mounting panel which is removably secured to the housing so that the panel can be removed from the housing, in order to provide access to the circuitry. The housing say also include an electrical circuitry means containlent chamber which is located behind the mounting panel so that the containment chamber and mounting panel form a fully nonconductive enclosure which surrounds the electrical circuitry leans. These and other aspects, features and advantages of the invention will be more fully understood and apprec rated by referenced to the written specification and appended drawings.

DETAILED DISCRIPTION OF Till PREFERRED EMBODIMENT In the preferred embodiment vacuum cleaner 1 Fig. 1 is of an upright design, having a sweeper portion 2 and a tank or handle portion 3. Sweeper portion 2 includes a unitary, structural foam housing Fig. 2 , which has a brush chamber 16, a vacuum passage channel 20, means 56 for bunting a motor, leans 48 for mounting wheel axles, and means 34, 40 for bunting electrical control means all integrally molded with housing 10. Motor 72 Fig. 2 mounted in housing 10, is vented through vent aperture 58 adjacent motor 72.Vent aperture 58 is covered by a cover 154 mounted on raised posts 59 so as to leave a specs through which air heated by motor 72 can flow for cooling purposes. Brush chamber 16 is sealed at end wall 28, through which the rotating driven. end 82 of brush 10 extends, by brush chamber seal 90 having sealing flange 92 and a mounting flange 94 mounted on a seal pads 30 adjacent end wall 28.Sealing flange 92 and mounting flange 94 define an angle greater than the angle between end wall 28 and seal pads 30, so that sealing flange 92 is pressed tightly against end wall 28 and deformed hen mounting flange 94 is mounted on seal pads 30. A plastic circuit box plate 136 is removably secured to housing 10, Fig. 9 to which various electrical circuitry 144, 146 and 148 is mounted. Plate 136 can be simply removed to access the electrical circuitry for servicing Housing 10 Fig. 3 is molded fro structural foal plastic and includes a top 12, a front wall 13, a rear wall 14, and two sides 15.Structural foam phenylene oxyde is the preferred material, having a tensile strength of about 3400 p.s.i., , flexural strength of about 6800 p.s.i., , compressive strength 10 deformation of about 5200 p.s.i., and ultimate shear strength of about 4450 p.s.i.Other structural foam plastics lay be satisfactory substitute materials. Inside housing 10 is an elongated roughly rectangular brush chamber 16 that extends along the front of housing 10. Brush chamber 16 is separated from the remainder of housing 10 by divider wall 18 and end wall 28, in order to provide a vacuum chamber for vacuum 1. Spaced along divider 18 and front wall 13 are screw apertures 31 which are used to secure a plate or shoe 106 to chamber 16. A rectangular vacuum channel 20 communicative with brush chamber 16 is formed by channel walls 22 that extend downward frond top 12. Channel walls 22 also have screw apertures 23 which are used to secure a channel 20. Vacuum aperture 24 is located, et the end of vacun channel 20 opposite brush chamber 16 and ellows dirt picked up by sweeper portion 2 to be traneported through housing 10 and into tank portion 3.Loca ed in channel 20 are recesses 26 which extend into top 12 in order to reduce the thickness of top 12 in the vicinity of channel 20. A cover plate not shown fits inside of channel 20 and covers recesses 26 so that channel 20 has a smooth top surface. Through end wall 28 of brush chamber 16 is an aperture 29 that is large enough to receive the driven end 82 of a beater brush 80 Fig. 13 . Adjacent end wall 28 are two seal mounting pads 30. Seal mounting pads 30 are flat surfaces, each of which has an aperture for securing brush chamber seal 90. Pads 30 are generally parallel to each other, but lie in two different verticle planes. A brush shaft mounting surf ce 32 is located on side 15 between seal pads 30. An electrical itch box 34 Fig. 3 is located in housing 10 adjacent vacuum channel 20. Electrical switch box 34 has walls 36 that extend downwardly fran top 12 to forming a quadrangel around an electrical switch mounting surface 38. A wire passage 39 extends fran the inside of switch box 34 through recess 26 so as to be corn sunicative with the opposite side of vacuum channel 20.Four screw apertures 37 are located at the corners of walls 36 that are used to secure a cover plate 118 to switch box 34. An open backed circuit box 40 is formed in the rear of housing 10 by walls 42 which extend downward frol top 12. Walls 42 separate the inside of circuit box 40 fran the remainder of the inside of housing 10, with the exception of a wiring aperture 44 Fig. 8 located in one of walls 42. A circuit plate 136 carries a variety of strain roliefe and control components located within circuit box 40.On rear wall 14 of housing 10 is a circuit plate mounting surface 46 Fig. 8 which has screw apertures 43 which are used to secure a circuit plate 136 to housing 10. Protruding from rear wall 14 and sides 15 at the rear of housing 10 are mounting surfaces 48 for two axles 128 Fig. 3 . Each mounting surface has a screw receiving aperture 49. Mounting surfaces 48 are disposed in pairs on either side of wheel slots 50. Wheel slots 50 allow the wheels to extend through rear wall 14 Figs. S, 7 . Located forward of axle mounting surfaces 48 are tank pivot bracket mounting surfaces 52 Fig. 3 . A bracket mounting surface 52 is positioned on either side of two spaced tank bracket slots 54, which allow a tank pivot bracket 124 to pass through housing 10 and be pivotally mounted on mounts 52. Four motor mounts 56 Fig. 3 dopend from top 12.Two of the motor mounts 56 are located near the side of vacuum channel 20 opposite electrical switch box 34. Moter mounts 56 are spaced around a roughly rectangular ventilator aperture 58 through top 12. Ventilator aperture 58 passes through a raised top 60. Raised top 60 forms roughly rectangular protrusion up from the smooth top surface of osing 10 Figs. 1, 4 . Ventilator aperture 58 is located in a recessed portion 62 of raised top 60. A lip 64 encircles recess 62.Lip 64 masks aperture 56 fran the side, and extends upwardly sufficiently that when cover 134 is placed over apertures 58, lip 64 and cover 154 give raised top 60 a level upper surface On the upper surface of top 12 are posts 59 which are spaced around vent aperture 58. Each post 59 has an aperture 66 in its center. Extending down into recessed portion 62 on one side of aperture 58 are lots 70. Slots 70 extend through top 12 and into vacuum channel walls 22, so that the thickness of walls 22 are reduced at those locations. Thin wall thickness reduction prevents the formation of hot spots at walls 22 during the molding process, , and insures that the structural foam plastic material does not ripple or deform at walls 22 or recess 62. Mounted within housing 10 is a brush motor 72 Fig. 2 . Rotor 72 is secured to mounts 56 by screws with motor 72 positioned adjacent ventilator aperture 58. In certain spplications of vacuum cleaner 1 a less powerful brush is required, so that r maller brush motor 72 can be used. In such applications r smaller brush motor 72 is mounted on mounts 56 by an adaptor bracket 74, shown in phantom in Figure 2.Adaptor bracket 74 has a base 75 which is screwed to two mounts 56. Two extending legs 75a extend laterally to base 75, to which the smaller motor is bolted. In both applications a pulley 76 is driven by motor 72. pulley 76 driving a belt 78 that rotates brush 80. Rotating brush 80 is an elongated cylindrical brush rotatably mounted in brush chamber 16. Driven end 82 has a narrowed neck 84 that is received in aperture 29 in end wall 28. Carried on driven end 82 is brush pulley 86 that is driven by belt 78. Driven end 82 is rotatably supported on brush mounting surface 32. Positioned adjacent and wall 28 is a seal 90 for sealing end wall aperture 29 around brush 80. Seal 90 Figs. 10 13 has b sealing flange 92 fran which extends a mounting flange 94. Sealing flange 92 and mounting flange 94 form an angle of one hundred degrees relative to each other.Mounting flange 94 has two protrusions or feet 95, each of which hava a hole 96 sed to sount seal 90. Feet 95 have faces that lie parallel to each other, but which lie in different horizontal planes in order to mate with seal mounting pads 30 on housing 10a Sealing flange 92 has a flat surface 93 that contacts end wall 28 when seal 90 im secured to housing 10.Sealing flange 92 has an oblong aperture 98 that has h width greater than the diameter of brush pulley 86 but a height less than that of brush y 86, so that seal flange 92 can be placed over one edge of brush pully 86 and shifted until seal flange 92 contacts narrow neck 84, allowing seal 90 to be pivoted past remainder of brush pulley 86. In each hole 96 through feet 95 is a pin 97, which fit into holes 33 in seal pads 30.End wall 28 and seal pads 30 form an angle of approximately ninety degrees relative to one another. Since the approximately one hundred degree angle formed by sealing flange 92 and mounting flange 94 is greater than the approximately ninety degree angle defined by pads 30 and end wall 28, when in place sealing flange 92 is pressed into abutment and deformed against end wall 28 Fig. 14 . This deformation forms a tight seal between sealing flange 92 and end wall 28.Sealing flange 92 has a shaved area 100 round the circumference of aperture 98 on the surface facing pulley 86. Shaved area 100 provides clearance between pulley 86 and seal 90, so that pulley 86 may rotate freely without interference from seal 90. Sealing flange 92 has a curved bottom edge 102 that extends past the bottom edge of end wall 28 when seal 90 is in position Fig. 14 . A brush shoe 104 covers the periphery of brush chamber 16 and defines a rectangular slot through which air flows into chamber 16 Fig. 2 . Brush shoe 104 is secured by screws to front wall 13 and divider wall 18, and has a pulley cover portion 106 at one end that covers pulley 86 and end wall 28. On one side of pulley cover port ton 106 is a curved groove which is shaped to s alingly engage bottom edge 102 of seal 90 Fig. 14 . When screwed into place shoe 104 presses pins 97 on seal 90 into seal pads 30 and deforms sealing flange 92 against end wall 28 to form a tight seal between end wall 28, shoe 104 and seal 90. Vacuum channel covers 110, 111 seal vacuum chan nel 20 Fig. 2 to form an air imp rmeable vacuum tunnel for transporting dirt from brush chamber 16 to vacuum aperture 24. Removable cover 110 is secured by a clip 112. Screws 114 hold cover 111 in place. An electrical switch box cover 118 covers electrical switch box 34 and the electrical switch mounted within. Switch cover 118 is formed from a plastic material and is secured to walls 36 by screws 120 which are contained completely within walls 36, so that electrical switch box 34 provides a completely nonconductive enclosure for the switch within. Two tank bracket axles 122 are mounted on tank bracket mounts 52, Fig. 2 with tank mounting bracket 124 extending through slots 54. One axle 122 has a spring 126 which urges tank mount bracket into a normally upright portion Two axles 128 are mounted on wheel axle mounts 48, each axle 128 having a wheel 130. A circuit box cover 132 Fig. 2 covers the bottom of circuit box 40 and is screwed to screw apertures 43 in walls 42. A circuit plate 136 Fig. 7 is screwed onto plate mounting surface 46. With circuit box cover 132 and circuit plate 136 in place, a fully nonconductive contsinment box rursounds the circuitry contained within.Mounted on plate 136 are two cords 142, one of which permits connection of the machine with an outlet source and the other providing power to the vacuum tank motor located in tank portion 3. Each cord 142 has a strain relief 144 which is located in plate 136 to prevent wear and failure of wires 142 at the point where wires 142 pass through plate 136. Also, carried on plate 136 is a circuit breaker switch 146 and a motor disconnect switch 148 that shuts off power to the motor driving the roller brush.Circuit breaker 146 Fig. 9 is a standard circuit breaker switch that has a threaded metal throat which is used to connect circuit breaker 146 to a mounting surface. Plate 136 carries a ring guard 140 that encircles the threaded metal throat in order to prevent accidental contact of the metal throat by a exposed wire. On the top of housing 10 is a cover plate 154 tigs. 5, 6 . Cover plate 154 has a surface periphery 156, about which are spaced raised pads 158. Depending from pads 158 are cover posts 160 that are shaped to be received in posts 59 on housing 10.Cover 154 is rectangular in shape and has a periphery slightly less than the periphery of recessed portion 62 in raised top 60. When cover plate 154 is mounted in recessed portion 62, a gap 162 is formed between cover plate 154 and housing 10. Gap 162 extends around cover plate 154 and is communicative with ventilator opening 58 to air flow from inside housing 10 through gap 162. Intending through the central portion of housing 10 is a height adjustment cam rod 150 Fig. 2 of standard design which is held in position by a bracket 152. Pivotally connected to the bottom of housing 10 is a bottom plate 164 on which are mounted front wh els 166 and which is shown in the open position in Fig. 2. Height adjustment bar 150 raises and lowers bottom plate 164 by conventional mains and thus adjusts front wheels 166. Extending around the outer periphery of housing 10 is a rubber guard strip 170 . Located at the leading edge of the right side 15 of housing 10 is a roller guide 172 Fig. 5 . Roller guide 172 has a housing 174 in which are mounted two rollers 176 that are generally aligned and rotatably connected to housing 174 by rivets 178, Rollers 176 are cylindrical and have vertically orient axes so they smoothly roll along an abutting vertical surface. ASSEMBLY AND OPERATION Housing 10 is molded as an integral element fro structural foam plastic material. Simultaneous with the molding of. housing 10, all of the internal structures, such as divider wall 1 , end wall 28, vacuum channel walls 22, electrical itch box 34, and circuitry box 40 are molded to form an integral unit with housing 10.During the molding of housing 10 all of the mounting surfaces, uch as seal mounting pads 30, brush mounting surface 32, whcel axle mounting surfaces 48, tank bracket mounting surfaces 52 and motor mounting surfaces 56 are also integrally molded within housing 10, with the mounting surfaces having their respective screw apertures for self tapping ere and the like molded in position in the initial molding process.Therefore the housing and all the internal structures are simultaneously molded in a single process step, and apertures need not be trilled nor surfaces ground down after this molding step. All mounting surfaces and walls must be dimensioned to allow a sufficient wall thickness. The structural foam material should develop an internal porous portion with a closed outer skin on either side.Structural surfaces should have a structural foam depth of about one quarter inch to develop an adequate porous portion. If the surface depth is less than approximately one quarter inch, the structural foam say not form the proper strength required to firmly mount all the chanical and electrical elenents. Prior to mounting brush 80 in chamber 160 oblong aperture 98 of seal 90 is passed over the top of pulley 86. Seal 90 is slid downward until it contacts narrow neck 84, , and is then pivoted around the remainder of pulley 86. Brush 80 is then connected to housing 10.Seal 90 is pressed into position with pins 97 received into holes 33. Brush shoe 104 is screwed into position on housing 10 with bottom edge 102 of seal flange 92 received in shoe slot 108. Sal 90 is deformed by shoe 104 so that the angle between sealing flange 92 and mounting flange 94 is reduced in order to provide tight seal between sealing flange 92 and end wall 28. Seal 90 reduces air flow around driven end 82 of brush 80 so that efficiency of vacuum cleaner 1 is increased, yet seal 90 does not interfere with the rotation of brush 80. When mounted in position, motor 72 is located adjacent ventilation aperture 58. Cover plate 154 is fitted over ventilator opening 58 with cover posts 160 passing through the holes in posts 59 on housing 10.Press fasteners fit over the ends of cover posts 160 to hold cover plate 154 in place. Gap 162 allows air flow round cover plate 154 so that the air heated by motor 72 may exhaust upward around cover plate 154 in order to cool both motor 72 and housing 10. Structural foam housing 10 does not conduct heat like aluminum housings or the like.If ventilator opening 58 were not provided, motor 72 could overheat and fail or the portions of housing 10 surround ing motor 72 could melt from the trapped heat. Electrical controls are installed in electrical switch box 34 and circuit box 40. Wires pass from circuit box 40 through back aperture 44 to motor 72. Other wiring passes through passage 39 into electrical switch box 34 to be connected to the electric switch mounted on mounts 38.With electrical switch cover 110, circuit box cover 132 and circuit box plate 136 screwed into place the electrical contzois punted in housing 10 are all confined within nonconductiv enclosures. These nonconductive enclosures provide a barrier to contacting the wiring and reduce the possibility of loose wiring contacting a conductive portion of the housing with consequent hazard to the operator and the vacuum cleaner. Since circuit box plate 136 carries cords 142, circuit breaker 146 and switch 148, these RTI ID 17.13 elements are all easily accessible for servicing by simply removing the four screws holding plate 136 in place. Guard ring 140 on the beck of plate 136 encircles the metal threaded throat on circuit breaker 146. Should a wire become disconnected within circuit box 140 guard ring 140 tends to shield the circuit breaker throat thus preventing electrical shock to an operator attempting to push the circuit breaker switch.The screws holding the plates in place all extend into the insulating walls where they cannot contact loose wiring or components. Roller guide 172 aligns sweeper portion 2 with a wall or other upright surfaces when cleaning along such surfaces. Also roller guide 172 serves as a bumper that prevents damage to the wall if sweeper portion 2 is accidentally struck against the wall. Since roller guide 172 has two pivotal rollers 176 that are generally aligned, roller guide 172 orients housing 10 in alignment with the wall being vacuumed against and koeps sweeper portion 2 in close abutment as rollers 176 roll along the wall It is to be understood that the above is merely a description of the preferred embodiment, and that various changes or modifications can be made without departing from the spirit or concept of the invention.
