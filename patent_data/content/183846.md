## Description
The invention relates to a system comprising a gas turbine and a sight tube assembly for controlling the firing temperature of the gas turbine, said gas turbine comprising A sight tube assembly of this type is known from GB A 1,589,531. Utility companies and other industries use large, stationary gas turbines to drive electric generators, pumps, or other types of machines. In the turbine section of the engine there are several rows of cup shaped blades, known as turbine blades, which are mounted on a rotor shaft. A gas heated to extremely high temperatures often above 980 C is directed against the turbine blades, which causes them to rotate and thus drive the rotor shaft. Before each row of rotating turbine blades is a row of stationary guide vanes, which are a part of the turbine section structure. As the hot gas moves through the turbine section, each row of guide vanes directs the flow of the gas so that it impinges on the rotating blades in the next row at the proper angle. Power output and fuel thermal efficiency of the gas turbine increase as the firing temperature increases. The service life of the turbine components turbine blades and guide vanes decreases with increasing temperature. There is thus an optimum firing temperature for which power production is maximized, fuel consumption per unit of power is minimized and the turbine components retain their integrity for their full design life. The first row of guide vanes and the first row of turbine blades operate at higher temperatures than do the successive rows of guide vanes and turbine blades. The hot gas cools as it expands from the high pressure in the turbine engine to the near atmospheric pressure in the turbine exhaust duct. At present there is no reliable method to directly monitor the temperatures of the first row of guide vanes and the first row of turbine blades in large industrial gas turbines. Thermocouples are short lived at such temperatures. Also, they are not easily adapted to measure the temperature of the rotating turbine blades, which historically have been the components whose failure has caused the gas turbine engines to be seriously damaged when over fired. Thus, it is most desirable to directly monitor the metal temperature of the first row of rotating turbine blades. At present, the average firing temperature is usually calculated in a control processor, which receives as input data the average turbine exhaust temperature and the compressor discharge pressure of the gas turbine. The control processor modulates the fuel supplied to the combustor or combustors in the engine, thus controlling the gas temperature at the inlet of the turbine section of the engine. A known prior optical pyrometer system which may be used for measuring blade temperatures and controlling operation of gas turbines is described in the above mentioned GB A 1,589,531. This system is used with fibre optics primarily for in flight temperature monitoring of engines on jet aircraft, and for obtaining blade temperature profiles in jet aircraft and other turbine engines mounted on test stands. The transducer of this known instrument comprises a fibre optic head, a flexible light guide and a detector amplifier module. The sight tube component of this system is mounted on the turbine engine, such that the lower end passes through the turbine section of the engine housing and is secured in an opening between two vanes in the first rob of the stationary guide vane section. The fibre optic head is connected to the upper end of the sight tube, and the probe for the optic head extends downwardly into the sight tube. At the lower end of the probe is a viewing lens, which is positioned a short distance behind the sight tube opening through the guide vane section. This allows the pyrometer to view the first row of the rotating turbine blades. The sight tube includes an air purge inlet near its upper end. Air for cooling the probe and purging the lens is directed through the inlet and flows downwardly through a small annular space between the probe and the inside of the sight tube. The flexible fibre optic light guide is connected at one end to the optic head and at its opposite end to the detector amplifier module, the module being enclosed in a housing and mounted in a remote location. An important disadvantage of this known system is that some of the transducer components must operate within the severe environment of the turbine engine, where they are subjected to high temperatures and pressures, vibration, and contaminants. Because these components are positioned within the engine environment, the engine must be shut down periodically to repair or replace such parts. The penetration of the lower end of the sight tube through the first row of the stationary guide vane section is particularly undesirable in large industrial turbines, because of the difference in construction from aircraft gas turbine engines. Another drawback of this system is that the line of sight from the optic head to the first row of turbine blades is restricted to a given size and position. In addition, the snug fit of the probe inside the sight tube does not allow for adjustment of the line of sight to move the target spot to different locations on the rotating blade surfaces. This limitation is undesirable, since the fixed target may not be the hottest part of the turbine blade. For example, scale buildup on the turbine blades can have an adverse effect on the temperature readings. Therefore, if the target spott falls on a part of the blade that is scaled over the temperature readings will probably be inaccurate. The invention has for its object the provision of a sight tube assembly in which these drawbacks are remedied. This object is achieved by a sight tube assembly in which The optical pyrometer and sight tube assembly of this invention has distinct advantages over the above described system for measuring blade temperatures in turbine engines. For example, the pyrometer and detector components are fastened to the sight tube at a position that is completely outside the high temperature and high pressure environments of the turbine engine. The sight tube is positioned in the turbine such that the pyrometer unit has a direct line of sight to the first row of the turbine blades. At the same time, the line of sight can be moved within the sight tube, so that the pyrometer can scan the blade surfaces to find the hottest spot, or the coolest spot. This invention may include a means for isolating the pyrometer unit from the engine environment, to perform service work, or to remove the pyrometer, without shutting the turbine down. Another advantage of this invention is that the sight tube structure provides an excellent view of the rotating turbine blades without penetrating the stationary guide vane section or other parts of the turbine section structure. Preferably the annulus surrounding the sight tube is in fluid communication with the compressor discharge section of the gas turbine, said sight tube having a plurality of openings therein positioned near the first end of the sight tube, said openings being in fluid communication with the annulus so that the sight tube can be purged with pressurized air from the compressor discharge section. One embodiment of a system, comprising a gas turbine and the sight tube assembly according to the invention will be further described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which With particular reference to Figures 1 and 2, the letter A indicates generally one embodiment of an optical pyrometer and sight tube assembly of this invention. Numeral 10 refers to the optical pyrometer unit, and a tubular member extending from the pyrometer unit defines a coupler neck 11. The flanged end of coupler neck 11 is connected to one of the flanged ends of a valve 12. A sight glass pressure seal 13 is sandwiched between the flanged ends of the coupler neck 11 and valve 12. The pyrometer unit 10 and sight glass 13 can be isolated from the environment of the turbine inlet section 19a by closing valve 12. Valve 12 can be operated manually or automatically, by electrical or pneumatic control systems. Suitable valves for this purpose are those in which there is a clear line of sight through the valve bore when the valve is in an open position. Examples of such valves are gate valves, ball valves, and plug valves. The sight tube assembly is made up basically of the sight tube 15 and a tubular member 14. The front end of the tubular member 14 is provided with a flange 14a which is secured to the flanged end of valve 12 which is opposite from coupler neck 11. The opposite end of the tubular member 14 not flanged is fastened to the turbine casing 16. The sight tube 15 fits inside of the tubular member 14. A flange 15a on the front end of the sight tube 15 is clamped between the flanged end 14a of the tubular member 14 and the flange of the valve 12. The outside diameter of the sight tube 15 is slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the tubular member 14, such that an annular space 17 is defined between the sight tube 15 and tubular member 14, as best shown in Figure 4. The lower end of sight tube 15 extends through a hot gas duct member 18 and prevents excessive leakage of compressor discharge air into the turbine inlet section 19a. As best shown in Figure 2, it is preferred that the lower end of the sight tube be flush with the inside surface 18a of the duct member 18. Beyond the surface 18a is the turbine inlet section 19a, where the gas temperatures are extreme. In the practice of this invention, the reason for not allowing the sight tube 15 to extend into the hot gas duct is to lessen the chance that thermal degradation will cause the end of the tube to fragment and break off. The sight tube 15 has several small openings 20 which are located near the flange 14a of the tube, as shown in Figure 4. The compressor discharge section of the turbine compressor 21 is an area that lies between the casing 16 and the hot gas duct 18 or ducts , as indicated generally by the numeral 21a. Within the turbine section 19 there are several rows of stationary guide vanes 22, and several rows of rotating turbine blades 23. As best shown in Figure 1, each row of turbine blades is mounted on a rotor shaft 24, and each row of the stationary guide vanes 22 is mounted within the turbine section, such that a row of guide vanes 22 is positioned before each row of the turbine blades 23. In a typical operation, the pyrometer unit continuously monitors the temperature of the first row of rotating turbine blades 23 and utilizes this data to automatically control the firing temperature of the turbine. There are several commercially available optical pyrometer systems that may be used in the practice of this invention. One of these systems, known as a two color pyrometer, is preferred as the primary temperature monitoring system in this invention. The detector of this unit responds to two wavelength bands of radiation, in which the temperature data is calculated as a ratio product of the two wavelengths. A particular advantage of this unit is its ability to compensate for changes in emissivity from the rotating blades. Another advantage is that the unit can compensate for variations in the transmission of the radiation through the sight glass, which can be caused by films or other materials that might obscure the view through the glass. Since the detector has a slow speed of response, a profile of individual blade temperatures cannot be obtained, but it does have the capability of reading out average temperature values. Other conventional optical pyrometer systems utilize a single band wavelength to detect radiation. A particular advantage of some of these systems is that the detector has a high speed of response to the radiation. This enables the pyrometer unit to read individual blade temperatures and thus find the hottest blades in the turbine section. One of the drawbacks of this unit is the emissivity variable, which is an integral part of the detector function. This variable makes the unit less reliable over a long period of time for obtaining average blade temperature readings. Another commercially available optical system, known as a spectrum analyzer, may be used in the practice of this invention to monitor the temperature of the rotating blades in a gas turbine. This unit can be used either in place of the pyrometer systems described above, or as a secondary instrument to supplement temperature data obtained by either of these instruments. A specific advantage of this unit is a detector that responds to radiant energy wavelengths across the entire spectrum, that is, from infrared to ultraviolet. To provide for the temperature monitoring operation, the optical pyrometer unit 10 and the sight tube assembly are installed, as previously described, in a position such as that shown in Figures 1 and 2. When the installation is complete, the turbine is started and valve 12 is moved to its open position. The pyrometer unit 10 is then adjusted to give a direct and clear view of a selected target spot on the first row of the rotating turbine blades 23. In Figure 3 a typical target spot is indicated schematically by a small s that appears on one of the turbine blades that is passing through the field of view. As illustrated in the drawings, the line of sight, indicated by reference numeral 26, follows a direct path from the pyrometer unit 10, through valve 12, sight tube 15, and passes through the opening between two of the stationary guide vanes 22 in the first row of the vanes. As mentioned earlier, the first row of the stationary guide vanes 22 is positioned ahead of the first row of turbine blades 23. It is the actual positioning of the sight tube 15 in the turbine engine that enables the pyrometer unit 10 to view the rotating turbine blades 23 along a direct line of sight. This capability of the optical pyrometer 10 to view the turbine blades 23 along the direct line of sight, which does not pass through any component of the turbine section, as illustrated herein, is believed to be a unique improvement. over any known technique for measuring turbine blade temperatures by optical pyrometry. As explained earlier, the function of the optical pyrometer unit 10 is to continuously monitor and sense the temperature of the turbine blades 23. The temperature data is transmitted to an electronic control circuit not shown , which controls various turbine operating conditions, such as inlet gas temperature, outlet gas temperature, fuel input, and the like. This enables the control circuit to automatically regulate the fuel supply to the turbine, and thus maintain the firing temperature at a desired level. During operation of the turbine, water vapor inside the turbine structure can move upwardly through the sight tube 15 and valve 12 and condense on the inside of the sight glass 13. The resulting condensate film on the sight glass can obscure the line of sight sufficiently to produce incorrect temperature readings. This problem is solved by purging the sight tube 15 with pressurized air from the compressor discharge section 21a. For example, air in the compressor discharge section 21a is at about 150 psi, which is about 5 psi higher than the inlet pressure of the gas in the turbine inlet section 19a. This pressure differential allows the air in the compressor discharge section 21a to flow back through the annular space 17 between tubular member 14 and sight tube 15. The air in space 17 passes through the openings 20, and flows through the sight tube 15 to the turbine section. As the air moves through the sight tube 15, it carries any water vapor with it. The sight glass 13 has the function of a viewing window for the pyrometer unit 10. Since the sight glass 13 is a solid piece of material with no openings therein, it functions as a critical pressure seal between the turbine and the pyrometer unit 10 when the valve 12 is in an open position. In the preferred embodiment of this invention, as described and illustrated herein, valve 12 provides a means for isolating the sight glass 13 and pyrometer unit 10 from the turbine engine environment. As pointed out earlier, this is an important feature of this invention, because it makes it possible to remove and replace the pyrometer unit 10 or the sight glass 13, or to service the instrument while the turbine is running. The scope of this invention also includes a second embodiment in which the valve 12 is omitted from the structure illustrated herein. In this embodiment the coupler neck 11 of the pyrometer unit 10 is connected directly to the flanges 14a and 15a of the tubular member 14 and sight tube 15, with the sight glass 13 being positioned between the flange of the coupler neck 11 and the flange 15a of the sight tube 15. As described earlier, it is the actual positioning of the sight tube in the turbine engine that enables the pyrometer unit to view the rotating turbine blades along a direct line of sight. The practice of this invention also includes being able to install the sight tube in a position that will allow the pyrometer unit, or another sensing instrument, to view other components internal to the engine, such as the stationary guide vanes, the hot gas duct, the combustors, or other parts. Another type of pyrometer that could be used in this invention is one that has been tuned to the emissions wavelengths of the gases present in the hot gas duct. Such a pyrometer could be used in conjunction with a sight tube, installed as described herein, and the sight tube could be purged with an appropriate gas that freely transmits the radiation emitted by the gases in the hot gas duct. This would enable the pyrometer to monitor the temperature of the gases in the hot gas duct. For the sake of simplicity, the disclosed invention has been illustrated in the drawings as a gas turbine utilizing a single hot gas conduit. The invention is applicable to gas turbines which include a plurality of hot gas conduits as indicated by the verbal description. In fact, the invention was first utilized in a multiple conduit turbine. The number of hot gas conduits is a matter of gas turbine design, and bears no relationship to the subject matter of the present invention.
