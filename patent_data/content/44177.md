# BLEND OF SULFONE POLYMER AND WHOLLY AROMATIC POLYESTER

## Abstract
A polymer blend which is capable of exhibiting an anisotropic melt phase, improved processability characteris tics, and the ability to form shaped articles having satisfac tory mechanical properties is provided. The polymer blend comprises aproximately 5 to approximately 75 percent by weight, based upon the total weight of the blend, of a sulfone polymer which is selected from the group consisting of polyether sulfone having recurring units of the formula
