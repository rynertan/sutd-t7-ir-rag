# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO COMPUTER MATRIX PRINTERS

## Abstract
A computer matrix printer has a ribbon carrier 26 pivotally supporting a body 12 of a printing head 14 . Solenoid arrangernents 32, 34 connect between the body 12 and the carrier 26 and are controlled by electronic means including a microprocessor, whereby the printing head 14 can be moved in opposite directions from a central position. Movement of the printing head 14 is therefore relative to the ribbon 16 held by the carrier 26 and enables printing in any one of three parallel discrete areas on the ribbon 16 holding different coloured inks. The micro processor can also enable printing in further colours by over printing one of the discrete colours with another, the over printing being carried out when the first ink applied to the print out 18 is still wet. Thus a plurality of colours can be provided with no registration problems and this is particularly suitable for a colour display on a video display unit. Further discrete colours may be included on the ribbon with suitable modification of the arrangement controlling movement of the printing head 14 .
