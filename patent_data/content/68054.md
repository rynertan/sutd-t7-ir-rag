## Abstract
An electric pump 14 is housed in a recess 12 in a wall of a water container 10 and the pump inlet tube 16 plugs into a lower portion 18 of the container. A polarized electri cal connector 32 plugs on to blade terminals 30 on top of the pump. In order to protect the connector from contamina tion and corrosion, even while allowing the unit to be moun ted externally on a tractor or other vehicle, the connector 32 carries a cover plate 40 attached by apertures lugs 36 of the connector snapped on to pegs 38 on the under side of the plate 40 . A plurality of pairs of pegs in different positions can be provided for use with pumps having their terminals 30 of like form but variously positioned. When the unit is fitted with the recessed wall against a mounting surface of the vehicle, the enclosure of the pump is com pleted.
