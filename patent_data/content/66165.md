# A totally porous activated gel.

## Abstract
A totally porous activated gel which comprises a matrix of a totally porous crosslinked copolymer comprising as main components vinyl alcohol monomer units and cross linkable monomer units and having a specifc surface area of 5 to 1000 mÂ² g and an reactive group linked to said matrix by a covalent bond. The present activated gel is very useful for effectively separating bio substances due to the peculiar behaviour of the reactive group of the activated gel. The activated gel is rigid, and is excellent in mechanical strength, resistance to chemicais, high pH, low pH, high temperature and low temperature, and is very effective in specific adsorption of bio substances. The activated gel can be subjected to freeze drying sterilization, heat sterilization and radiation sterilization, so that it can be utilized for the medical treatment by extracorporeal perfusion of, for example, blood.
