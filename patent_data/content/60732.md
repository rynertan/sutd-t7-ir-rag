# CONTROLLED COOLING APPARATUS FOR A WIRE ROD

## Abstract
A controlled cooling apparatus is disclosed for a wire rod 1 coiled into loops immediately after hot rolling. The coiled wire rod 1 is transported with said loops laid sub stantially flat at a given pitch from one another on a cooling bed 7 . Nozzles 6 are provided to project a cooling fluid such as forced air from below the cooling bed 7 at an angle of from 40 to 140 with respect to the plane of the cooling bed to cool the coiled wire during its transportation. The nozzles 6 are open in a transverse direction of the cooling bed 7 with a nozzle opening area ratio of from 0,8 to 1.2, to provide uniform distribution of the cooling fluid in the transverse direction and thus provide uniform cooling. This reduces the variation in the cooling rates as between densely overlapped loop portions and sparsely overlapped loop portions.
