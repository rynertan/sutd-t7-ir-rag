# Brake control system.

## Abstract
A brake control system for a multiple unit train of mixed motor cars and trailer cars of the type usually to be found operating as metro or mass transit trains and in which the motor cars have dynamic brakes operation of which is blended with, but given preference over, the friction brakes of all units. A brake demand signal calling for a given level of train retardation is weighted on each vehicle, according to the load of the vehicle, and the level of dynamic braking effort invoked on each motor car is limited in accordance with a maximum adhesion level calculated in proportion to the measured load of that car. In a modified arrangement the adhesion level is calculated in accordance with the load of the lightest loaded motor car. Signals representing the amount of dynamic brake effort achieved by each motor car is supplied to a trailer car and subtracted from the load weighted braking effort for the trailer car and the result used to actuate the friction brakes of the trailer.
