# Induction motor control system.

## Abstract
In a control circuit for driving an induction motor wherein an AC voltage is converted into a direct current by a rectifying circuit and the direct current is converted into a signal of a variable voltage and frequency by means of a transistor inverter connected in parallel with a smoothing capacitor, a regenerative circuit is connected in parallel with the inverter, and a first monitoring circuit is provided for comparing the terminal voltage V
