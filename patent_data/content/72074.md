# Means and method for testing and sorting miniature electronic units.

## Abstract
System of testing and sorting according to tested ranges of values of miniature electronic capacitor and resistor units 10. A planar carrier 20 with rows 26 and files 24 of openings, loaded with such units 10, is dis posed in an oblique plane to retain the units 10 in place. The carrier 20 ist moved in a stepped manner past an electrical testing station 119 and past a series of sorting stations 121 126. At the testing station 119, a file of probes 90 is brought into electrical contact with one end of a set of electronic units 10 in each file 24. A metal ply 34 laminated in the carrier 20 contacts the other end of the set of electronic units 10. A bridge network 186 makes measurements by connecting to the file of probes 90 and to the metal ply 34. A receptacle 131 136 is disposed at each sorting station 121 126. As each file 24 of electronic units 10 passes the receptacles 131 136, the units 10 are selectively deposited in the receptacles 131 136, by air jets, according to tested ranges of values.
