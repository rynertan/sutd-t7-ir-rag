# Picture frame assembly components.

## Abstract
Components are provided for forming a picture frame which include frame sections 22 adapted to be oriented at an angle to form a corner of the frame at adjacent ends of the sec tions. A bracket 60 is provided for each corner and has a first leg 62 and a second leg 64 . One leg 62 is disposed within a channel 32 formed in one of the frame sections 22 at the corner and the other leg 64 is disposed within a channel 32 of the other of the two frame sections 22 at the frame corner. At least one of the legs of each bracket has a slanting engage ment surface 66, 72 . A screw 80 is threadingly engaged with one of the frame sections and also engages the bracket slan ting engagement surface to urge the bracket leg along the frame section in which it is disposed in a direction away from the other frame section at the corner to draw the facing re gions of the two frame sections together at the corner. The specification also describes clips for retaining sheets within the completed frame, clips for securing hanging wires to the frame, and supports for maintaining the frame upright on a horizontal surface.
