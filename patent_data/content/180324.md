# Infinitely variable belt drive.

## Abstract
An infinitely variable power transmission mechanism com prising a driving sheave assembly and a driven sheave assembly with a torque transmitting drive belt connecting the sheave assemblies, a ratio controlling servo for changing the efective pitch diameter of the sheave assemblies, a belt loading servo for controlling the load capacity of the belt and relatively reduced friction diaphragm achtuators for adjustably positioning movable sheave portions of the sheave assemblies, the belt and sheave assembly portions of the mechanism being in a housing area that is isolated from gearing portions of the mechanism.
