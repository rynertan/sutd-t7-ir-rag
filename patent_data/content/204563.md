## Description
PROCESS FOR DEPOSITING ZINC OXIDE The present invention relates generally to the deposition of zinc oxide films. In one of its more particular aspects, this invention relates to zinc oxide films useful in photoconductive applications deposited by an improved chemical vapor deposition process. In many applications where a zinc oxide film is deposited upon a heat sensitive substrate, such as a photoconductive layer or layers, it is not desirable to deposit the zinc oxide at temperatures which may adversely affect the substrate. Although zinc oxide films have also been produced by chemical vapor deposition, such films have generally been produced only at high temperatures, for example, at temperatures of 350 to 7300 C. In addition, films so produced have been characterized by relatively high resistivities. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a process for depositing a zinc oxide film at a relatively low temperature. Another object of this invention is to provide such a process in which various additives can be conveniently added to the zinc oxide during deposition of the film to decrease the resistivity thereof. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description. The present invention utilizes an improved chemical vapor deposition CVD process for depositing zinc oxide films having properties which make them useful in photoconductive applications such as in solar cells and other photovoltaic devices. The process includes introducing an organotinc compound, an oxidant and an inert carrier gas into a chamber containing a substrate heated to a temperature in the range of about 60 to 3500 C. The resulting zinc oxide films inlay have a resistivity in the range of about 10 4 to 10 2 ohm centimeter.Such films may contain hydrogen and may be fabricated to contain a group III element by introducing volatile group III compounds into the chamber along with the organozinc compound and oxidant. In general, the present invention relates to an improved chemical vapor deposition process for depositing doped zinc oxide films upon substrates such as photoconductors. Since many photoconductors are heat sensitive, it is an advantage of this inven tion that the deposition of zinc oxide, according to the process of the present. invention, does not require high temperatures. Another advantage is that the resistivity of the resulting zinc oxide film can be varied by the use of suitable additives. In fact, the reistivity can be varied during the deposition process to produce a film or layer in which the resistivity varies from bottom to top. Another advantage is the low cost of depositing zinc oxide films using the improved CVD process of this invention. The process is conducted by introducing an organozinc compound, an oxidant, and any desired vola tile additive into a chamber containing the desired substrate, which is heated to a temperature within the range of about 60e to 3500 C, preferably 100e 200 and more especially to a temperature of about 150 C.By heating the substrate, deposition of zinc oxide upon the walls of the chamber is avoided. In addition, deposition takes place only upon those areas of the substrate which are heated, thus making it possible to deposit a zinc oxide layer upon the entire surface of the substrate or only selected portions thereof. The system for depositing zinc oxide films in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention utilises a chamber containing a heated table, means for introducing the reactants into the chamber in gaseous form and a regulated pumping system to provide a dynamic gas flow through the chamber. An organozinc compound and oxidant are carried into the chamber in individual streams of an inert carrier gas. Mixing of the organozinc vapor and oxidant occurs before contact with the heated surface of the substrate in the space between the point of introduction thereof and the heated substrate surface.Reaction between the organozinc compound and oxidant results in decomposition of the organozinc compound to produce zinc oxide, which is deposited upon the substrate as a thin film, with COZI CO and volatile hydrocarbons as possible byproducts of the reaction. The zinc oxide film contains hydrogen and may contain a groupIII element where a volatile compound of a group III element is also introduced into the deposition chamber. Suitable organozinc compounds include zinc dialkyls having the formula R2Zn, wherein R is an alkyl radical, preferably a lower alkyl radical. Dimethyl zinc, CH3 2Zn and diethyl zinc, C2H5 2Zn are particularly preferred. Suitable oxidants include water, oxygen, ozone, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and other oxygencontaining gases as well as organic oxygen containing compounds. Representative of suitable organic oxygencontaining compounds are alcohols having the formula, R OH ethers having the formula R O R aldehydes having the formula,EMI4.1 ketones having the formula,EMI4.2 esters having the formula,EMI4.3 amides having the formula EMI5.1 and sulfoxides having the formulaEMI5.2 whereR and R are alkyl. referably lower alkyl to mention but a few of the possible organic oxidants which might be used. The composition of the gaseous streams can be varied. The organozinc vapor is produced by vaporizing the organozinc compound into the gas stream, for example by bubbling a stream of inert gas through a reservoir of organozinc compound. Other vaporization methods are equally effective. The mole fraction of the organozinc compound in its carrier gas stream can be up to about 0.5. A mole fraction of about 0.2 is especially preferred The oxidant is similarly introduced into the deposition chamber by any suitable method. Bubbling an inert gas through a reservoir of deionized water to produce a mixture of inert carrier gas and water vapor, for example, is an effective method for introducing water vapor. The mole fraction of water vapor or other oxidant in its carrier gas stream can be up to about 0.5. The proportion of oxidant to organozinc compound can be varied depending upon the particular properties of the zinc oxide film desired. In general, an excess of oxidant is desirable. Films deposited using excess organozinc compound have markedly higher resistivities and display poor adhesion to the substrate.A range of about 1 3 moles oxidant per mole of organozinc compound can be used. The flow rates of the mixture of inert gas and organozinc compound, and the mixture of the inert gas and oxidant can be varied depending upon the particular mole ratios and partial pressures of reactants which are intended to be reacted at the surface of the substrate. For example, where bubblers are used to introduce the reactants, flow rates of the mixture of the inert gas and organozinc compound and inert gas and oxidant should be in the range of about 5 SCCM to 100SCCM per square foot of deposition surface. The inert gas used as a carrier for the organo zinc vapor and the oxidant can be any inert gas, for example, argon or helium, or any gas which is inert under the conditions prevailing in the deposition chamber, such as nitrogen. Pressures within the deposition chamber in the range of about 0.1 torr to 2 torr have been found to facilitate the deposition process. Pressures can be varied by control of the reactant gas streams or by means of a regulated pumping system. The hydrogen containing zinc oxide deposited according to the process of the present invention has been found to have a resistivity in the range of about 10 4 to 10 2 ohm centimeter and a light transmission of greater than 90 . The resistivity can be reduced by adding group III elements to the zinc oxide film. For example, aluminum can be introduced by using trimethyl aluminum, CH3 3Al. similarly, boron can be introduced by utilizing diborane, B2H6. Gallium and indium can also be used as additives. Addition of about 1 4 mole percent of the selected additive or additives based on the organozinc vapor content has been found to be desirable. Addition of about 2 mole percent is preferred.Where boron is to be incorporated into the zinc oxide film, diborane is introduced in a stream of inert gas, such as argon, along with the organozinc compound and oxidant. Boron containing zinc oxide layers produced in accordance with the process of the present invention have been found to have resistivities in the range of about 5 x 10 4 ohm centimeter to 2.5 x 10 3 ohm centimeter. Aluminum containing zinc oxide layers have been found to have resistivities in the range of about 1.0 x 10 3 ohm centimeter to 2 x ohm centimeter. Deposition rates of about 200 Angstroms per minute at 125 C. and 600 Angstroms per minute at 1500 C. are readily attainable. Rates are also controlled in part by gas flow rates and partial pressures of reactants. Zinc oxide films can be deposited to any desired thickness by controlling the time and rate of deposition. Typical films are 1 2 microns thick. The polycrystalline boron containing zinc oxide formed is found to have an x ray diffraction pattern corresponding predominantly to 002 orientation with respect to the plane of the substrate, whereas aluminum containing zinc oxide has 100 preferred orientation. By means of the process of the present invention, it is thus possible to deposit large areas of zinc oxide and to control the resistivity thereof. In this manner, for example, conductive zinc oxide layers for use in solar cells can be readily deposited. Depending upon the particular additive utilized in the process, it is also possible to produce other zinc oxide layers for use in photoconductive devices and having varying physical and electrical properties. While certain specific embodiments of the invention have been disclosed as typical, the invention is, of course, not limited to these particular forms, but rather is applicable to all such variations as fall within the scope of the intended claims. For example, other group III additives than aluminum and boron can be used to provide zinc oxide layers having varying properties. In addition, various other reaction conditions than those specifically mentioned above can be used in the process of the present invention.
