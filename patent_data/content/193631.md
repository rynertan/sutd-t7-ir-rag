## Description
EVICE FOR DISSIPA TING HEXA, PARXICULARLY, IN MOTOR VEHICLE HEADLIGHTS, SEARCHLIGHUS, AND THE LIKES This invention relates to a device for dissipating heat particularly in motor vehicle headlights, search lights, and the like. As is known, foglights, headlights, and other comparable lighting fixtures carried on motor vehicles and having a parabolic reflector body formed from some plastic material incur the serious.problern of how to dissipate the heat, generated by incandescent lamps, when lit inside the reflector body towards the outside thereof. In fact, the heat produced is, in some cases quite substantial and may result in deformation of a lamp holder body made of plastics. In an attempt to solve this problem, a conventional approach is that of installing, on the interior of the parabolic reflector body, reflective metal surfaces which practically form a protective shield against the heat for the parabolic reflector. This prior approach, whilst providing a surface having good light reflecting properties, is less than fully satisfactory from a functional standpoint of heat dissipation, because such a protective shield is only effective to protect the surfaces from heat generated by an incandescent lamp, lit inside the reflector body, instead of dissipating the heat to the exterior thereof, and has the additional disadvantage of increasing the manufacturing and assembling costs for the parabolic reflector. It is,.therefore, the ail of this invention to obviate the above problem by providing a device for dissipating heat particularly in motor vehicle headlights, lights, and the like, which includes means for encouraging the dissipation of heat, generated by a lit incandescent lamp from the interior to the exterior of a parabolic reflector. Within the above aim, it is a particular object of the invention to provide such a device which is simple to assemble, and, while affording greatly improved performance, requires no additional component elements over and above those which are normally comprised in a motor vehicle headlight, searchlight or the like, by adapting elements which are normally included in any such headlight or searchlight to dissipate heat. It is a further object of this invention to provide such a device which is simple to manufacture and can give full assurance of being reliable and safe to use. The above aim, as well as these and other objects such as will be apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a device for dissipating heat particularly in motor vehicle headlights, searchlights, and the like, according to the invention, characterised in that it comprises, on the interior of a parabolic reflector, a lamp holder bracket made of a thermally conductive material and having at least one portion thereof in contact with at least one portion of a connection element formed from a thermally conductive material and having at least one other portion thereof, located on the exterior of said parabolic reflector, adapted for thermal conduction contact with the body of a motor vehicle or the like. Further features and advantages will be apparent from the following detailed description of a device for dissipating heat particularly in motor vehicle headlights, searchlights, and the like, with reference to the accompanying illustrative but not limitative drawings, where Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view of a headlight incorporating the device of this invention Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of the headlight Figure 3 is a view of the parabolic reflector body showing the exterior thereof and Figure 4 is a rear view of the headlight of figure 1, in an assembled condition thereof. Making reference to the cited drawing figures, a device for dissipating heat particularly in motor vehicle headlights, searchlights, and the like, according to this invention, comprises a lamp holder bracket 2 located on the interior of a parabolic reflector 1 having a body ib, formed with a mounting hole Ic and a through hole id, and closed at the front open end le thereof by a glass panel 1a and may have any suitable configuration. Advantageously, the parabolic reflector 1 includes a plastics body which is coated internally with a reflective layer 20. The lamp holder bracket 2 defines, in a conventional manner a substantially U shaped configuration formed at an upper portion 2a thereof, with a yoke 3 for engagement with an in candescent lamp 4, and is formed at the bottom portion 2b thereof with a deep hollow 5 adapted to fit into a seat 6 defined in the bottom portion of the body ib of the reflector 1 at the area where a mounting bracket 11 is located. The lamp holder bracket 2, which is engaged by a lamp retaining spring, Indicated at 8, is formed from a thermally conductive material, such as steel or the like. At the lower portion of the hollow 5 there engages as by contact with the hollow itself a connection element which comprises, in this case, a pin 10, including a mid portion 1Qb and a head 10c, at least an end part of said. pin 10 opposite to said head 10c being threaded, for engagement, with a threaded nut 10a, also being made of steel, for securing the body of the reflector 1 to a mounting bracket 11, comprising a pair of mutually parallel legs lib, each having a through hole 11c, lid formed therein and extending orthogonally from a plane containing a centre portion ila formed therebetween, said mounting bracket 11 advantageously defining a U like shape. The mounting bracket 11 is formed at its center portion ila with a throughgoing hole 12 adapted for engagement by a bolt 13 for fastening to the body of the motor vehicle or the like, whilst said through holes 71c, lid are adapted for engagement by said pin 10, Thus, with the arrangement just discussed, the pin 10 and its respective locknut 10a practically form a heat bridge between the mounting bracket 11 and lamp holder bracket 2, which bridge is effective to transfer to the outside of the lamp holder most of the heat generated by the incandescent lamp 4 when lit. In fact, the pin 10 has its mid portion 10b in close thermal conduction contact with the lower portion 2b of the lamp holder bracket 2, whilst its outer portion of the pin 10 including the head 10c and the nut 10a threadedly mounted thereon is in contact relationship with the legs lib of the bracket 11, which is located on the exterior of the reflector body, and accordingly is effective to dissipate to the outside thereof any heat generated by the incandescent lamp 4, being assisted also by virtue of the fact that the midportion ila is adapted for contacting a motor vehicle body. It may be appreciated from the foregoing description that the invention achieves its objects, and in partic ular the fact is outstanding that without employing any added elements but merely altering and rationalising the configuration of the lamp holder bracket, the important advantage is afforded of establishing an internal to external thermal bridge, whilst introducing no risk of water or the like getting into the lamp holding body. Another important advantage stems from that by providing a device for dissipating heat, the parabolic reflector no longer requires to be made of a metal material separately from the reflector body, but may be simply provided by the reflective coating, indicated at 20, on the inner surface of the reflector body 1 of plastics. In practicing the invention, any materials, dimensions and contingent shapes, may be any selected to meet individual requirementss providing that they are compatible with the intended application.
