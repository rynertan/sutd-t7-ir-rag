# Method for suppressing the generation of hydrogen gas from cured silicone materials.

## Abstract
Contacting cured addition type cured silicone material with hydrogen gas suppressing materials which are com pounds containing phosphorus, sulfur, nitrogen, or aliphatic unsaturation reduces or eliminated the undesirable hyd rogen gas generation. Examples of such hydrogen gas suppressing materials are triethylphosphine, Î³ mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, N,N diethylaminoethanol, 3 methyl 1 butyne 3 ol, and
