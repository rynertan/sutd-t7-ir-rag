## Description
SYNTHETIC PEPTIDES HAVING PITUITARY GROWTE HORMONE RELEASING ACTIVITY Background of the Invention 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to peptides which possess pituitary growth hormone releasing activity.2. Description of the Prior Art Growth hormone, which is secreted from the pituitary, causes growth of all tissues of the body that are capable of growing. In addition growth hormone is known to have the following basic effects on the metabolic process of the body .1. Increased rate of protein synthesis in all cells of the body 2. Decreased rate of carbohydrate utilization in cells of the body 3. Increased mobilization of free fatty acids and use of fatty acids for energy. A deficiency in growth hormone secretion can result in various medical disorders, such as some instances of dwarfism. Various ways are known to release growth hormone. For example, chemicals such as arginine,L dihydroxyphenylamine L DOPA , glucagon, vasopressin, and insulin induced hypoglycemia, as well as activities such as sleep and exercise, indirectly cause growth hormone to be released from the pituitary by acting in some fashion on the hypothalmus perhaps either to decrease somatostatin secretion or to increase an unknown endogenous growth hormone releasing hormone or both. Compounds which directly act on the pituitary to release growth hormone include prostaglandin E1 andE2, theophylline, and cyclicnuclectides. Howevor, these compounds neither specifically release growth hormone nor are they believed to act at the putative growth hormone releasing hormone receptors in the peripheral membrane of the pituitary cell to initiate growth hormone release. In addition, under special conditions certain chemically defined peptides, e.g., vasopressin, thyroid releasing hormone TRH , luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone LH RH , a melanocyte stimulating hormone MSH , glucagon, substance P, neurotensin Met enkephelin, a endorphin, cholera enderotoxin, and basic myelin protein, act to release growth hormone from the pituitary. However, only TRH acts directly on the pituitary to elicit this response. Furthermore, the above listed peptides release other pituitary hormones and under most experimental conditions do not release growth hormone. For example, TRH does not release growth hormone in normal rats or in normal humans or from pituitaries of normal rats or monkeys.In vitro, TRH releases growth hormone, prolactin, and thyroid stimulating hormone TSH and in vivo TRH releases these hormones from bovine pituitary. Vasopressin s induced release of growth hormone is considered to be due to a non specific response to stress caused by administration of high dosages of vasopressin. Accordingly it would be highly desirable to have a compound which directly acts on the pituitary under normal experimental conditions to effect the release of growth hormone therefrom. Such peptides would be useful in vitro as unique research tools for understanding how growth hormone secretion is regulated at the pituitary level and would also be useful in vivo to treat symptoms related to growth hormone defici encies. Summary of the Invention In accordance with the present invention there is provided peptides which act directly on the pituitary under normal experimetal conditions in vitro to release growth hormone therefrom. These growth hormone releasing peptides can be utilized in vitro as unique research tools for understanding, inter alia, how growth hormone secretion is regulated at the pituitary level. Also, the growth hormone releasing peptides of the instant invention can also be administered in vivo to increase growth hormone release. More particularly, this invention encompasses novel peptides having a formula selected from a group consisting of X Y1 Z1 E1 G1 J1 Q I X Y2 Z2 E2 G2 J2 Q II X Y3 Z3 E3 G3 J3 Q III X Y4 Z4 E4 Q IV X Y5 Z5 E5 J5 Q V X Y6 Z6 E6 J6 Q VI X Y7 Z7 E7 G7 J7 Q VII X Y8 Z8 E8 G8 Q VIII X Y9 Z9 E9 G9 J9 Q IX X Y10 Z10 E10 G10 J10 L10 Q X and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein X is selected from a group consisting of NH2, NHCH3, and N CH3 2 Y1, G1, Y2, G2, E4, Z5, J5, Y6, G6, Z7,G7, Y8, G8, Yg, Gg, Y10, and G10 are selected from a group consisting of tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenyl alanine zl, J1 Z2, Z3, E3, Y4, Z4, E5, G5, E61 J6 Y7, E7, Zs, E8, Z9, E9, Z10, and J10 are selected from a group consisting of D tyrosine, D tryptophan, and D phenylalanine and Z6 are selected from a group consisting of glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, hydroxyproline, serine, threonine, cysteine, and methionine E1 is selected from a group consisting of glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, hydroxyproline, serine, threonine, cysteine, methionine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, asparagine, glutamine, and histidine E2 is selected from a group consisting of glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, methionine, and isoleucine J2 is selected from a group consisting of glycine, alanine, D alanine, valine, D valine, leucine, D leucine, isoleucine, D isoleucine, proline,D proline, hydroxyproline, D hydroxyproline, serine,D serine, threonine, D threonine, cysteine, D cysteine, methionine, and D methionine Y3 is selected from a group conisting of tyrosine, D tyrosine, tryptophan, D tryptophan, phenylalanine, and D phenylalanine G3 is selected from a group consisting of lysine and arginine Y5 is selected from a group consisting of D lysine and D arginine J7 is selected from a group consisting of glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, hydroxyproline, serine, threonine, cysteine, methionine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, asparagine, glutamine, arginine, and lysine Jg is selected from a group consisting of natural amino acids and the D configuration thereof X is selected from a group consisting of NHCHOCH3, NH2, NHCH3, and N CH3 2 E10 is selected from a group consisting of glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, serine, threonine, methionine, asparagine, and glutamine L10 is selected from a group consisting of asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine, serine, and threonine and Q is a C terminal functional group selected from a group consisting of amide CONH2 , amide lower alkyl NHR , amide di lower alkyl CONR1R2 , lower alkoxy CH2OR , hydroxy CH20H carboxy COO and the lower ester derivatives thereof COOR .

techniques.The synthesis, for example, can be commenced from theC terminal end of the peptide using an a amino protected amino acid. A suitable starting material can be prepared, for instance, by attaching the required a amino acid to a chloromethylated resin, a hydroxymethyl resin, or a benzhydrylamine resin. One such chloromethylated resin is sold under the tradename BlO BEADS SX l by Bio Rad Laboratories, Richmond,California and the preparation of the hydroxymethyl resin is described by Bodanszky et al., Chem. Ind. London 38, 1597 1966 . The benzhydrylamine ALIA resin has been described by Pietta and Marshall, Chem. Commn. 650 1970 and is commercially available fromBeckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, California in the hydrochloride form thereof BHA HCl . In the preparation of the compounds of this invention, an a amino protected amino acid can be coupled to the chloromethylated resin with the aid of, for example, cesium bicarbonate catalyst, according to the method described by Gisin, Relv. Chim. Acta, 56, 1467 1973 . After the initial coupling, the a amino protecting group can be removed by a choice of reagents including trifluoroacetic acid TFA or hydrochloric acid HCl solutions in organic solvents at room temperature. After removal of the a amino protecting group, the remaining protected amino acids can be coupled stepwise in the desired order.Each protected amino acid can be generally reacted in about a 3 fold excess using an appropriate carboxyl group activator such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC in solution, for example, in methylene chloride CH2Cl2 dimethyl formamide DMF mixtures. After the desired amino acid sequence has been completed, the desired peptide can be decoupled from the resin support by treatment with a reagent such as hydrogen fluoride HF which not only cleaves the peptide from the resin, but also cleaves all remaining side chain protecting groups. When the chloromethylated resin is used, hydrogen fluoride treatment results in the formation of the free peptide acids of Formula I Y COOH .When the benzhydrylamine resin is used, hydrogen fluoride treatment results directly in the free peptide amides of Formula I Y CONH2 . Alternatively, when the chloromethylated or hydroxymethylated resin is employed, the side chain protected peptide can be decoupled by treatment of the peptideresin with ammonia to give the desired side chain protected amide or with an alkylamine to give a sidechain protected alkylamide or dialkylamide. Side chain protection can then be removed in the usual fashion by treatment with hydrogen fluoride to give the free amides, alkylamides, or dialkylamides. In preparing the esters of this invention, the resins used to prepare the acids of Formula I Y COOH can be employed and the side chain protected peptide can be cleaved with base and the appropriate alcohol, i.e., methanol. Side chain protecting groups can then be removed in the usual fashion by treatment with hydrogen fluoride to obtain the desired ester. The solid phase procedure discussed above is well known in the art and has been essentially described by J. M. Stewart, Solid Phase PeptideSynthesis Freeman and Co., San Francisco, 1969 . The growth hormone releasing pentapeptides ofFormula I are useful in vitro as unique tools for understanding how growth hormone secretion is regulated at the pituitary level. This includes use in the evaluation of many factors thought or known to influence growth hormone secretion such as age, sex, nutritional factors, glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, as well as fasting and non fasting states. In addition, the peptides of this invention can be used in the evaluation of how other hormones modify growth hormone releasing activity. For example, it has already been established that somatostatin inhibits growth hormone release.Other hormones that are important and in need of study as to their effect on growth hormone release include the gonadal hormones testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone the adrenal hormones cortisol and other corticoids, epinephrin and norepinephrine the pancreatic and gastrointestine hormones, insulin, glucagon, gastric, secretion, the vasoactive intestinal peptides, i.e., bombesin and the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine. The peptides of the instant invention can also be employed to investigate the possible negative or positive feedback effects of some of the pituitary hormones, e.g., growth hormone and endorphin peptides, on the pituitary to modify growth hormone release. Of particular scientific importance is the use of these peptides to elucidate the subcellular mechanisms mediating the release of growth hormone. The peptides of the present invention can also be administered to warm blooded animals, including man, to release growth hormone in vivo. For example, the peptides can be administered to treat symptoms related to growth hormone deficiencies. In addition, these peptides can be administered to commercially important animals to accelerate and increase their rate and extent of growth.

By introducing various other hormones, e.g., somatostatin, testosterone, ccrtisol, insulin, etc. into the incubation medium of Examples 22 and 23, one can study what effect these latter hormones have on the regulation of growth hormone secretion. Example 24 In Vivo Diagnostic Application A peptide within the scope of this invention is injected It into a mammal, including a human. Blood samples are taken before and at 15 minute intervals after the IV injection for about 1 to about 2 hours. Serum growth hormone levels are measured on each of the blood samples. The rise in growth hormone level is an index of the response. The degree of the growth hormone response is indicative of whether the hypothalmicpituitary unit is functioning normally to secrete growth hormone. This test can be employed for evaluating whether the hypothalamic pituitary system is normal under a large number of different clinical and experimental conditions in both healthy and disease statesThe test has application at all ages and in both sexes. Based on this disclosure, many other modifications and ramifications will naturally suggest themselves to those skilled in the art. These are intended to be comprehended as within the scope of this invention.
