## Description
PLASMIDS The present invention relates to plasmids, and in particular to chimeric plasmids suitable for use in recombinant DNA genetic engineering techniques. A key element in the transfer of foreign NNA into a host organism is the transfer vector. One group of transfer vectors that are commonly employed in genetic engineering techniques are the plasmids. These are circular extrachromosomal DNA that autonomously replicate in susceptible host organisms. They are generally found in microbial cells and represent only a small of a cell s total DNA. The molecular weight of plasmid DNA is generally in the region of a few million daltonso Many of the plasmids that have besn isolated so far, have been found to code for a variety of cell functions, including resistance to antibiotics or heavy metals, or the production of bacteriocins.Plasmids may be used in their natural form or maybe constructed from DNA isolated from two or more different sources. This latter type of plasmid is known as a chimeric plasmid. The transfer of genetic information from one organism to another using a plasmid as a transfer vector is usually performed as follows. First the circular plasmid JA is opened to afford a linear molecule. This step is preferably performed by a restriction endonuclease enzyme. These enzymes catalyse the hydrolysis of DNA molecules at specific sites within the nucleotide chain, the position of hydrolysis being determined by the presence of a specific nucleotide sequence within the DNA molecule. Once openc4, one end of the linear plasmid is then combined with a fragment of foreign DNA and the conibined molecule is then re circularised. The reclrcularised recombinant 2 h is then transferred to the host organinr , this transfer being known as cell transformation. Finally, cells containing recombinant DNA are isolated from those which are recombinantDNA free by a selection process. If the recombinant plasmid is resistant to, for example, a given antibiotic, then selection is effected by treatment of the cells both transformed and recombinant DNA free with the said antibiotic. Only transformed cells will survive the treatment and they may therefore be isolated. Plasmids are therefore particularly suitable transfer vectors because they are able to enter a host organism and replicate during host multiplication they confer, for example, antibiotic resistance to transformed cells and therefore allow the selection of these transformed cells to take place and they combine with and retain foreign heterologous DNA fragments. For some aspects of recombinant DNA technology it is especially desirable that the plasmids used as transfer vectors should, in addition, have at least one further characteristic, namely a large number of single restriction enzyme cleavage sites within their structures. By single restriction enzyme cleavage site is meant one cleavage site for a particular restriction enzyme per plasmid molecule. The presence of a single restriction enzyme cleavage site within a plasmid molecule means that, on digestion of the plasmid with the particular restriction enzyme, the sugar phosphate backbone of the molecule is ruptured in one position only on each of the plasmid s polynucleotide strands. Thus, digestion of the plasmid with such a restriction enzyme, converts the circular plasmid into a linear double stranded DNA molecule preferably with cohesive termini without loss of any of the original circular plasmid s nucleotides. The presence of a large number of single restriction enzyme cleavage sites within a plasmid molecule affords a correspondingly wide choice of positions for effecting this linearisation. If many of this large number of cleavage sites lie outside the essential genetic areas of the plasmid, for example those parts of the gene that determine plasmid replication and expression and confer antibiotic resistance, then linearisation of the plasmid at anyone of these cleavage sites in non essential areas, followed by DNA combination and recircularisation, will normally provide a recombinant plasmid containing a foreign heterologous DNA fragment which retains the replicating, expressing and antibiotic resistance properties of the original plasmid. Thus a large number of single restriction enzyme cleavage sites in the plasmid, especially if many of them lie within the plasmid s nonessential areas, will generally increase the choice of routes to, for example, a desired product that are open to, for example, a person skilled in the recombinant NNA art. Such a plasmid would therefore be particularly useful in any of the fields, for example, medical and industrial, in which recombinant DNA techniques are employed. The present invention provides plasmids that not only fulfil the usual requirements for transfer vectors in recombinant DNA techniques but also, have the desired large number of single restriction enzyme cleavage sites, many of which lie outside the plasmids1 essential genetic areas. According to the present invention there is provided a plasmid selected from the group consisting of a a plasmid conferring resistance to tetracycline Tcr and neomycin Neor on a host, and being built up by the in vitro ligation of a Neor non chimeric plasmid and a Tcr non chimeric plasmid, b a deletion, insertion or deletion insertion derivative of a group a plasmid, and c a rearrangement derivative of a group a or group b plasmid. In the present specification a deletion derivative of a Tcr Neor group a plasmid is a plasmid with part or parts of the Tcr Neor plasmid s nucleotide chain excised, an insertion derivative is a plasmid with one or more foreign heterologous DNA fragments inserted into the TcrNeor group a plasmids nucleotide chain, a deletion insertion derivative is a plasmid with part or parts of the Tcr Neor group a plasmid s nucleotide chain excised and with one or more foreign DNA fragments inserted and a rearrangement derivative is a plasmid derived from a precursorplasmid by rearranging esp reversing part of the precursor plasmid s nucleotide chain. A nonchimeric plasmid is a plasmid which has not been constructed by the in vitro ligation of two or more parent plasmids. One example of a Tc r Neor plasmid according to the present invention is pAB 324S as hereinafter defined. Chimeric plasmid pAB 324 is both tetracycline and neomycin resistant, codes for the pUB 110 replicon and has a molecular weight of about 6.0 Md. With reference to the following restriction enzymes namely Ava I, Bam HI,Bal I, Bcl I, Bgl II, Bst EII, Cau II, Eco RI, hae II, HSeIII, Hga I, Hind II,Hind III, Hma I, Pvu II, Tha I, Xba I and Xho I, hereinafter referred to as the chosen restriction enzymes the nucleotide structure of chimeric plasmid pAB 324 has the following order of cleavage sites, Xba I, Ava I, Bam HI, Pvu II, Tha B Hae 1I, Cau I Hae III, Hae 8 Yii 7 I ffB II iH ad II, Eco RI, Hind III, Hae III, Bcl I, Hind II Hpa I, Pvu II Bal I, Hae III, Tha I, Cau II, Bcl I, Hind II, Bst EII, Eto RI, Tha I, Eco RI, Hga I,Xho I, Xba I. The restriction enzyme cleavage map corresponding to the above order of cleavage sites is illustrated in Figure 1 infra . It is particularly advantageous property of plasmid pAB 324 that it has single cleavage sites for the restriction enzymes Ava I, Bam HI, Bal I, B II, Bst YETI, Hga I, Hind III, Hpa I, Xba I and Xho I. This property makes pAB 324 a very useful transfer vector, expecially for use in microorganisms wherein the pUB 110 replicon present in pAB 324 will operate.Preferred micro organisms include B. subtilis, especially the strainB. subtilis NCIB 11621 deposited on 12 December 1980 at the NationalCollection of Industrial Bacteria, Aberdeen, Scotland equivalent toB subtilis ATCC deposited on 1981 at the AmericanType Culture Collection, Maryland, USA or the strain B subtilis NCIB 11623 deposited on 12 December 1980 at NCIB Aberdeen, Scotland equivalent toB subtilis ATCC deposited on 1981 at ATCC, Maryland,USA . In particular, since insertion of DNA at the Bgl II site is known to inactivate neomycin resistant genes T J Gryczan et al, J.Bact, 1980, 141, 246 this is a particularly preferred site for cloning foreign DNA using pAB 324. The present invention further provides a process for the production of plasmid pAB 324 wherein a B. subtilis is transformed by plasmid pAB 124 pUB 110, as hereinafter defined, b the transformed cells of B.subtilis are selected for tetracycline and neomycin resistance, and c plasmid DNA is isolated from the Tcr Neor cells. Any suitable strain of B.subtilis may be used, preferably however the strain B.subtilis NCIB 11621 or 11623 ATCC is employed. Selection by tetracycline and neomycin is preferably performed at antibiotic levels between about 6 and 25 pg ml. Plasmid DNA may be isolated by any of the methods well known to those skilled in this art, for example, by extraction of total DNA from the Tcr Neor cells, followed by separation of plasmid from chromosomal DNA. Plasmid pAB 124 pUB 110 is a deletion insertion derivative of pAB 324. It expresses only tetracycline resistant genes, codes for both the pAB 124 and the pUB 110 replicon and has a molecular weight of about 5.9 Md. With reference to the chosen restriction enzymes the nucleotide structure of chimeric plasmid pAB 124 pUB 110 has the following order of cleavage sites Xba I, Ava I, Bam HI, Pvu II, Tha I, Hae II, Cau II, Hae III, Hae II, Hind II, Bgl II, Hae Ill Hind II, Eco RI, Xba I, Hae III, Eco RI, IIae III, Bcl I, Hind II Hpa I, Pvu II Bal I, Hae III, Tha I, Cau II, Bcl I, Hind II, Bst ElI, Eco w Tha I, Eco RI, Hga I, Tha I Bcl I, Xba I.The restriction enzyme cleavage map corresponding to the above order of cleavage sites is illustrated in Figure 2 infra . It is particularly advantageous property of the chimeric plasmid pAB 124 pUB 110 that it has single cleavage sites for the restriction endonucleases Ava I, Bam HI, Bal I, Bgl II, Bst EII, HXa I, and lIna I.Digestion of the plasmid with any one of these restriction enzymes will afford an open chain structure which retains the full nucleotide sequence of the circular plasmid pAB 124 pUB 110, in many cases this open chain structure will also possess cohesive termini, at both the 5 and 3 ends of the molecule. Chimeric plasmid pAB 124 pUB 110 may be prepared by the following process wherein a plasmid pAB 124 as hereinafter defined and plasmid pUB 110 as hereinafter defined are each opened, to form open chain structures, at a position within their nucleotide sequences ICTAGA, corresponding AGATOT to their respective Xba I cleavage sites, b the end groups of open chain pAB 124 and open chain pUB 110 are modified to provide respectively linear pAB 124 and linear pUB 110, each with Xba I cohesive termini, and c the linear pAB 124 and linear pUB 110 are annealed and ligated to form chimeric plasmid pAB 124 pUB 110, as herein defined. pAB 124 is a tetracycline resistant plasmid originally derived from the thermophilic bacillus, B. stearothermophilus, as described by A H A Gingham et al, J Gen Microbiol, 1979, 114, 401. A transformed micro organismBacillus subtilis pAB 124 , was deposited on 12 December 1980 at theNational Coilection of Industrial Bacteria NCIB , Aberdeen, Scotland asB.subtilis NCIB 11622 equivalent to ATCC deposited on 1981 at ATCC, Maryland, USA . pAB 124 nay be isolated from any suitable natural source or from any suitably transformed micro organism, in particular B.subtills NCIB n16 2 ATCC by DNA extraction, followed by separation of plasmid from chromosomal DNA. With reference to the chosen restriction endonucleases the nucleotide structure of pAB 124 has the following order of cleavage sites, Xba I,Hae III, Eco RI, Hae III, Bcl I, Hind II tipa I, Pvu II Bal I, Hae III,Tha I, Cau II, Bcl I, Hind II, Bst EII, Eco RI, Tha I, Eco RI, Hga I,Tha I Bcl I, Xba I. The restriction enzyme cleavage map corresponding to the above order of cleavage sites is illustrated in Figure 3 infra . pUB 110 is a neomycin Kanamycin resistant plasmid originally derived from Staphylococcus aureus as described by R W Lacey et al, J Med.Microbiol, 1974, 7, 285, and has been characterised by T J Gryczan et al,J.Bact, 1978, 134, 318. A transformed micro organism B.subtilis pUB 110 , containing pUB 110, was deposited on 12 December 1980, at NCIB, Aberdeen as B.subtilis NCIB 11624 equivalent to ATCC deposited on 1981 at ATCC, Maryland, USA . pUS 110 may be isolated from any suitable natural source or from any suitable transformed micro organism, in particular B.subtilis NCIB 11624 ATCC by DNA extraction followed by separation of plasmid from chromosomal DNA. With reference to the chosen restriction endonucleases, the nucleotide structure of pUB 110 has the following order of cleavage sites, Xba I, Ava I, Bam HI, Pvu II, Tha I, Hae II, Cau II, Hae III, Hae II, Hind II,Bgl II, Hae III Hind II, EFo RI, Xba I. The restriction enzyme cleavage map corresponding to the above order of cleavage sites is illustrated inFigure 4 infra . Step a of the above process for producing pAB 124 pUB 110 may be performed by any suitable method well known in the recombinant DNA art. For example the openings of pAB 124 and pUB 110 may be performed by hydrodynamic shear by digestion with an appropriate restriction enzyme to form, for example, non cohesive flush ended termini or by limited treatment with a non specific endonuclease eg DNase I . In step b of theprocess of the invention the open chain pAB 124 and open chain pub 110 are modified to provide, respectively, linear pAB 124 and linear pUB 110, each with Xba I cohesive termini by any suitable method. For example, open chain pAB 124 and open chain pUB with noncohesive termini may each be joined to an appropriate synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide.to provide Xba I specificity at their 5 and 3 ends. The ends with a phosphate group on, respectively, the 5 and 3 carbon . The synthetically modified open chain pAB 124 and pUB 110 may then be digested with restriction enzyme Xba I to provide linear pAB 124 and linear pUB 110 with the required Xba I cohesive termini. In a preferrred embodiment of the present process steps a and b are combined, linear pAB 124 and linear pUB 110, each with Xba I cohesive termini, being obtained by digesting pAB 124 and pUB 110 respectively with the restriction endonuclease Xba I. Linear pAB 124 and linear pUB 110 each having the required Xba I cohesive termini are then joined by annealing the cohesive termini of the two linear plasmids and then covalently bonding the two plasmids to each other sealing the nicks between the plasmids by ligation using DNA ligase . pAB Subsequently the chimeric plasmi4 124 pUB 110 may be obtained in substantially pure form by transforming the mixture obtained from step c above into cells of a suitable host micro organism, selecting the Tcr only cells and isolating pAB 124 pUB 110 from the selected tetracycline resistant cells.Alternatively, pAB 124 pUB 110 may be obtained in substantially pure form by transforming the mixture into cells of a suitable host micro organism, selecting the Tcr Neor cells, and isolating pAB 124 pUB 110 from the plasmid pUB 110 and other nucleic acids contained in theseTcr Neor cells. The purification of pAB 124 pUB 110 by transformation into a host Tc selecting r Tcr r r organism, selection for Tcr or Tc Neo resistance and isolation may be performed by any of the methods well known in the art. Any host organism in which the pAB 124 replicon, the pUB 110 replicon or both of these replicons are active may be used. Preferred organisms are, for example B.subtilis, or a thermophilic bacillus such as B.stearothermophilus. Tetracycline concentrations of between about 6 and 25 pg ml are preferred. pAB 124 pUB 110 being a hybrid of both pAB 124 and pUB 110, contains both Tcr genes from pAB 124 and Neorgenes from pUB 110 . It is therefore a surprising feature of pAB 124 pUB 110 that only the Tcr gene is expressed.pAB 124 pUB 110 also codes for both the pAB 124 and pUB 110 replicon. This may allow pAB 124 pUB 110 to replicate in micro organisms in which the pAB 124 replicon operates, the pUB 110 replicon operates or both the pAB 124 and pUB 110 replicon operate. For example replication of pAB 124 pUB 110 will take place in B.subtilis. Transformation of plasmid pAB 324 into competent cells of B.subtilisNCIB 11621 ATCC gives 3050 Neo and 3250 Tcr transformants per g DNA, all of which may be shown to have a Neor Tc r phenotype by replica plating. The plasmid pAB 324 therefore gains, by comparison with its precursor pAB 124 pUB 110 the ability to express Neor genes. It is believed that this ability results from the deletion of part of the nucleotide structure of pAB 124 pUB 110, although the invention is not in any.way limited by this explanation. A comparison of the cleavage site maps of pAB 124 pUB 110 and pAB 324 respectively Figures 2 and 1 infra indicates two regions of homology.One corresponding to the neomycin resistance genes, the other to the tetracycline resistance genes. Between these two regions a deletion has occurred where one Eco RI, one Xba I and one Hae III site in pAB 124 pUB 110 has been deleted in pAB 324, and a Hind III site not present in pAB 124 pUB 110 has been generated in pAB 324. Further comparison of pAB 324 and pAB 124 pUB 110 show a quite large insert, in pAB 324, adjacent to the Xba I site. This insert contains a unique Xho I site that is not present in pAB 124 pUB 110, with a small deletion to the right where one Tha I and one Bcl I site present in pAB 124 pUB 110 has been deleted. The insert in pAB 324 containing the Xho I site is derived from the B.subtilis chromosome. pAB 324 or other Tcr Neor plasmids according to this invention may be used as transfer vectors in recombinant DNA technology either in their original form or with certain parts of their nucleotide chains deleted.Such deletion products may be produced by any suitable method, for example by hydrodynamic shear, or restriction enzyme cleavage, followed by recircularisation. These deletions will preferably occur in a non essential part or parts of the Tcr Neor plasmids nucleotide structure. Suitable deletions will leave resultant plasmid with the ability to replicate in a suitable host organism and, preferably, also to confer antibiotic resistance especially or Neor or both onto said host. Depending on the position of the deletion in the nucleotide structure of the Tcr Neor plasmids the micro organism suitable for transformation by the new deleted plasmid, may be, for example,B subtilis or a thermophilic bacillus, such as B.stearothermophilus. In one example of such a deletion, deletion of the Bam HI Bgl II 1 Md fragment of pAB 324, yields a new plasmid pAB 624 as hereinafter defined . pAB 624 is a tetracycline resistant plasmid which codes for the pUB 110 replicon. c.f. pAB 324 which is both Tcr and Neor and codes for the pUB 110 replicon . pAB 624 has a molecular weight of about 5.0 Md.With reference to the chosen restriction enzymes and the restriction enzyme Mbo I, the nucleotide structure of pAB 624 has te following order of cleavage sites, Xba I, Ava I, 14bo I, Hae III Hind II, Eco RI, Hind III,Hae III, Bcl I Mbo I, Hind II XDa I, Pvu II Bal I, Hae III, Tha I, Cau II, Bcl I Mbo I, Hind II, Bst EII, Eco RI, Tha I, Eco RI, Hga I, Xho I, Xba I. The restriction enzyme cleavage map corresponding to the above order of cleavage sites is illustrated in Figure 5 infra . It is a particularly advantageous property of pAB 624 that it has single cleavage sites for the restriction enzymes Ava I, Bal I, Bst EII, Cau II,Hga I Hind III, Hpa I, Pvu II, Xba I and Xho I. This property makes pAB 624 a very useful transfer vector, especially for use in micro organisms in which the pUB 110 replicon present in pAB 624 will operate. Preferred micro organisms include B.subtilis, especially the strain B.subtilis NCIB 11621 or 11623 ATCC or pAB 624 may be prepared from pAB 324 by any suitable method. Preferably, however, pAB 624 is prepared by a the consecutive digestion of pAB 324 with the restriction enzymes Bgl II and Bam HI to yield two linear DNA molecules followed by b recircularisation of the longer linear DNA molecule obtained from step a by annealing and ligation. On recircularisation the combined Bam HI and Bgl II cohesive termini form an Mbo I cleavage site. pAB 624 may then be obtained in substantially pure form by transforming the mixture obtained after recircularisation of the longer linear DNA molecule into a suitable host micro organism, selecting the cells that are only resistant to tetracycline and isolating pAB 624 from the selected tetracycline resistant cells. Suitable host micro organisms include any micro organisms in which the pUB 110 replicon operates, particularlyB. subtilis, especially the strain B. subtilis NCIB 11621 or 11623 A ISC or Tetracycline concentrations of between about 6 and 25 MgXml are preferred. Insert ion of one or more heterologous DNA fragments into a Tcr Nor plasmid, such as pAB 324, or into a deletion derivative thereof, such as pAB 624, may be performed by, for example a The terminal transferase procedure, b The restriction enzyme procedure, c The synthetic linker procedure, or d The transformation into a suitable micro organism procedure outlined below. The foreign DNA frapllent may be obtained by, for example, digestion with one or more restriction enzymes or fragmentation by physical methods sonication, homogenisation etc of the complete DNA molecules derived from sources, heterologous to the plasmid, such as eukaryotic or prokaryotic sources. Alternatively the foreign DNA fragment may be synthesised chemically or enzymatically, for example, by using the enzyme reverse transcriptase derived from RNA tumour viruses. The foreign DNA fragment may itself be significant in the medical1 industrial or research fields or it may, for example, be a structural gene coding for a protein having such significance.Such proteins would include the hormone insulin, a growth hormone, an interferon, a virus antigen such as hepatitis B virus antigen and other therapeutically active proteins or peptides. Alternatively, the insertion of the foreign DNA fragment into a Tcr Neor plasmid according to this invention or deletion derivatives thereof may yield still further plasmids useful as transfer vectors. In one example of the terminal transferase procedure the chosen plasmid Tcr Neor plasmid or deletion derivatives thereof is first cleaved in a non essential part of its nucleotide structure to give a linear molecule.This step may be performed by, for example, digestion of the plasmid with a suitable restriction enzyme in particular an enzyme with only one cleavage site in the plasmid molecule . The linear plasmid and the foreign DNA fragment, obtained by a suitable method, are then separately treated with the enzyme Xexonuclease, an enzyme that removes nucleotides from the 5 end of DNA strands. The linear plasmid is then mixed with a deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate e.g. deoxyadenosine triphosphate, dATP in the presence of the enzyme terminal transferase. This step provides the 3 termini of the linear plasmid with a homopolymeric tail comprising a polydeoxyribonucleotide e.g. poly dA . The foreign DNA fragment is then similarly treated with terminal transferase, but in the present of the deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate that is complementary to that added to the linear plasmid e.g. deoxyribothymidine triphosphate dTTP . In an alternative embodiment of this process the X exonuclease step may be omitted if the terminal transferase steps are performed in the presence of cobalt ions . The linear plasmid and the foreign DNA fragment now contain homopolymeric tails that are complementary in sequence, and, thus, when they are mixed under annealing conditions they are able to associate by formation of hydrogen bonds at the 3 terminal sequences. Reaction of the annealed product with DNA polymerase and DNA ligase in the presence of deoxyribonucleotides produces a recombinant DNA molecule consisting of the reformed plasmid with an inserted foreign DNA fragment that is flanked by two tailing sequences. In one example of the restriction enzyme procedure the plasmid TcrNeor plasmid according to the present invention or deletion derivatives thereof is cleaved by a restriction enzyme at a single site within a non essential part of the plasmid s structure. The fragment of foreign DNA is then obtained from a suitable source by digestion of the foreign DNA with the same restriction enzyme used to cleave the plasmid. The linear plasmid and foreign DNA fragment now have the same cohesive termini and thus, when they are mixed under annealing conditions, hydrogen bonds are formed between their complementary base pairs. The new composite molecules are then sealed by ligation, to form a recombinant DNA molecule comprising the entire plasmid and a foreign DNA fragment. In one example of the synthetic linker procedure the plasmid Tcr Neo r plasmid according to the present invention or deletion derivatives thereof is cleaved in a non essential part of its structure by a restriction enzyme A. The linear plasmid is then treated with an S1 Nuclease enzyme to remove the linear plasmid s single stranded ends and to form a molecule with non cohesive termini. This modified plasvid is then joined at both of its termini to a synthetic linker a chemically synthesised double stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide specific for a second restriction enzyme B. Digestion of the linear plasmid now affords a molecule having the cohesive termini cbaracteristic of restriction enzyme B. The fragment of foreign DNA is obtained from a suitable source by digestion of the foreign DNA with restrictio enzyme Be The linear plesmid and the foreign Th trn t now htvc t.ho z cohesive termini a .d thus, when they ar r k per a a ui Y hydrogen bonds are formed between their complementary base pairs. The new composite molecules are then sealed by ligation. Finally, in the transformation of a plasmid into a suitable microorganism, the Tc r Neo plasmid, according to the present invention or deletion derivatives thereof, is transformed, into a suitable host microorganism and deletion of part of the plasmid s nucleotide structure insertion of a foreign DNA fragment, from the host micro organism s chromosomal DNA into the plasmid or both deletion and insertion may occur. A particularly preferred micro organism for the above procedures, in the insertion of foreign DNA into the plasmids of the present invention, is B.subtilis, especially the strain B.subtilis NCIB 11621 or 11623 ATCC or Insert ion derivatives of the Tcr Neor plasmids of this invention or deletion derivatives thereof should retain the ability to replicate in a suitable host organism and, preferably, to confer antibiotic resistance especially Tcr, Neor or both onto said host. Further, if the inserted heterologous fragment is a structural gene one which codes for a protein , this gene should be expressed in the host organism. Preferably, when a structural gene is inserted into a Tcr Neor plasmid or a deletion derivative thereof the reading frame of the structural gene will be in register with the reading frame of the Tcr Neor or deletion plasmid and the direction of transcription of the structural gene is the same as the direction of transcription of the Tcr Neor or deletion plasmid. Most preferably the structure s gene is operatively linked to an expression control sequence within the Tcr Neor or deletion plasmid. Depending on the position of the insertion and on the structure of the inserted polynucleotide, the micro organism suitable for transformation by the new insertion plasmid derivative of the Tcr Neo or deletion plasmid will be one in which the recombinant DNA Tcr Neor or deletion plasmid plus insertion replicates and may be one in which the recombinant DNA expresses antibiotic resistance, especially Tc r Neor or both, and, if the heterologous fragment is a structural gene, expresses the structural gene. Preferred micro organisms will be either B subtilis or a thermophilic bacillus, such as B. stearothermonhilus, One example of an insertion derivative of a deletion derivative of aTcr Neor plasmid according to this invention which may be useful as a transfer vector is pAB 724 as hereinafter defined . pAB 724 is a tetracycline resistant plasmid which codes for the pUB 110 replicon. pAB 724 has a molecular weight of 6.0 Md.With reference to the chosen restriction enzymes and the restriction enzyme Mbo I, the nucleotide structure of pAB 724 has the following order of cleavage sites, Xba I, Ava I, Mbo I,Hind II, Hae II, Hae III, Cau II, Hae II, Tha I, Pvu II, Mbo I, Hae III Hind II, Eco RI, Hind III, Hae III, Bcl I Mbo I, Hna I Hind II, Bal I Pvu II, Hae III, Tha I, Cau II, Bcl I Mbo I, Hind II, Bst ElI, Sco RIi Tha I, Eco RI, Hga I, Xho I and Xba I. The restriction enzyme cleavage map corresponding to the above order of cleavage sites is illustrated inFigure 6 infra . It is a particularly advantageous property of plasmid pAB 724 that it has single cleavage sites for restriction enzymes Ava I, Bal I, Bst EII,Hga I, Hind III, Hpa I, Xba I and Xho I. This property makes pAB 724 a very useful transfer vector, especially for use in micro organisms wherein the pUB 110 replicon, present in pAB 724 will operate. Preferred microorganisms include B.subtilis, especially the strain B.subtilis NCIB 11621 or 11623 ATCC or pAB 724 may be prepared by any suitable method.Preferably however pAB 724 is prepared from pAB 624 by a partially digesting pAB 624 with the restriction enzyme Mbo I, b reacting the linearised pAB 624 with the Bam HI Bgl II fragment deleted from pAB 324 to form pAB 624, and c recircularising the products obtained from step b by annealing followed by ligation. In the above process not only is pAB 724 formed by pAB 324 and pAB 624 are reformed. Therefore in order to isolate substantially pure pAB 724 from the mixture obtained from step c above, said mixture is first transformed into a suitable host organism, the cells resistant only to tetracycline are selected and pAB 724 is isolated from the selected tetracycline resistant cells. In order to obtain pAB 724 free from pAB 624 cells containing pAB 724 may also be selected from cells containing unchanged pAB 624 by treating the plasmids obtained from the respective cells with the restriction enzyme Mbo I. Cells which contain a plasmid with four Mbo I sites are those transformed with pAB 724. Alternatively pAB 724 may be prepared from pAB 324 as follows a digesting pAB 324 consecutively with the restriction enzymes II II and Bam HI, b treating the mixture obtained from step a under annealing conditions, and c ligating the products obtained from step b . In the above process not only is pAB 724 formed but also pAB 624 is formed and pAB 324 is reformed. Therefore in order to isolate substantially pure pAB 724 from the mixture obtained from step c , said mixture is first transformed into a suitable host micro organism and the cells resistant only to tetracycline are selected. Cells containing pAB 724 are then selected from cells containing pAB 624 by treating the plasmids obtained from the respective cells with the restriction enzymeMbo I. Cells which contain a plasmid with four Mbo I sites are those transformed with pAB 724. Suitable host micro organisms for transformation in either of the above methods include any micro organism in which the pUB 110 replicon operates, particularly B.subtilis especially the strain B.subtilis NCIB 11621 or 11623 ATCC or Tetracycline concentrations of between about 6 and 25 g ml are preferred. It will be seen that pAB 724 is also a rearrangement derivative of pAB 324, the Bam HI, Bgl II 1 Md segment of pAB 524 being reversed in pAB 724. The insertion derivatives of the deletion derivatives of the Tcr Neor plasmids, the deletion insertion D I plasmids, for example pAB 724, may be used as transfer vectors in recombinant DNA technology either in their original form as hereinbefore set out or with certain parts of their nucleotide chains deleted. Such deletion products may be produced by any suitable method. For example by hydrodynamic shear, or restriction enzyme cleavage, followed by recircularisation. These deletions from the D I plasmids will preferably occur in a non essential part or parts of the D I plasmid s nucleotide structure.These suitable deletions willleave the resultant plasmid with the ability to replicate in a suitable host organism and, preferably, also to confer Tc resistance especially r r, Neon antibiotic resistance especially Tcr, neor or both onto said host.Depending on the position of the deletion in the nucleotide structure of theD I plasmids the micro organism suitable for transformation by the new deleted plasmid may be, for example, B.subtilis or a thermophilic bacillus, such as B stearothermophilus. Insertion of one or more heterologous DNA fragments into a D I plasm id, such as pAB 724, or a deletion derivative thereof a D I D plasmid may be performed by, for example, any of the insertion procedures outlined for insertion into a Tcr Neo plasmid. Suitable fragments of heterologous DNA may include those listed under the insertion derivatives of Tc Neo plasmids. Alternatively, the insertion of the heterologous DNA fragment into a D I or D I D plasmid may yield still further plasmids suitable as transfer vectors. Insertion derivatives of a D I or a D I D plasmid should preferable retain the ability to replicate in a suitable host organism and to confer antibiotic resistance especially Tcr, Neor or both onto said host. Further, if the inserted heterologous fragment is a structural gene one which codes for a protein , this gene should be expressed in the host organism. Preferably when a structural gene is inserted onto a D I or aD I D plasmid the reading frame of the structural gene will be in register with the reading frame of the D I or the D I D plasmid and the direction of transcription of the structural gene is the same as the direction of transscription of the D I or the D I D plasmid. Most preferably the structural gene is operatively linked to an expression control sequence within theD I or the D I D plasmid. Depending on the position of the insertion and on the structure of the inserted polynucleotidef the micro organism suitable for transformation by the new insertion plasmid derivative of the D I or the D I D plasmid will be one in which the recombinant DNA plasmid plus insertion replicates and may be one in which the recombinant DNA expresses antibiotic resistance especially Tcr, Neor or both, and, if the heterologous fragment is a structural gene, expresses the structural gene. Preferred micro organisms will be B.subtilis or a thermophilic bacillus, such as B.stearothernophilus. D I plasmids derived from a Tc r Neor plasmid according to the present invention may also be prepared by a synthetic route which is independent of the Tc r Neor plasmid. One example of such a D I plasmid is pAB 124 pUB 110, a deletion inserticn derivative of the Tcr Neor plasmid, pAB 3 4. As outlined above pAB 124 pUB 110 expresses only tetracycline resistant genes, codes for both the pAB 124 and the pUB 11 replicon and has a molecular weight of about 5.9 Md. This plasmid may be prepared by combining pAB 124 and pUB 110. pAB 124 pUB 110 may be used as a transfer vector in recombinant DMA technology either in its original form ashereinbefore set out or certain parts of its nucleotide chain deleted. Such deletion products, which do not include the removal of the pAB 12h nucleotide sequence .eafXng pUB 110 or the removal of the pUB 110 nucleotide sequence leaving pAB 124 may be produced by any suitable process. For example, treatment of pAB 124 pUB 110 with the restriction endonuclease Hae II, will remove a DNA fragment with a molecular weight of about 0.28 Md.Recircularisation by, for example, annealing followed by logation of the linear molecule, from which the 0.28Md fragment has been deleted, affords a new plasmid pAB 024, with a molecular weight of about 5.6 Md, and with the following order of restriction enzyme cleavage sites with reference only to the chosen restriction enzymes ,Xba I, Ava I, Bam HI, Pvu II, Tha I, Hae II, Hind II, Bgl II, Hae III Hind II, Eco RI, Xba I, Hae III, Eco RI, Hae III, Bcl I, Hind II 1Ia I,Pvu IIgBal I, Rae III, Tha I, Cau II, Bcl I, Hind II, Bst YETI, Eco RI Tha I,Eco RI, Hga I, Tha I Bcl I, Xba I. The restriction enzyme cleavage map of pAB 024 corresponding to the above order of cleavage sites is illustrated inFigure 7 infra . These deletions from pAB 124 pUB 110 will preferably occur in a nonessential part or parts of pAB 124 pUB 110 s nucleotide structure. Thus suitable deletions from pAB 124 pUB 110 would leave the resultant deleted plasmid with the ability to replicate in a suitable host organism and preferably also to confer antibiotic resistance especially Tcr, Neor or both onto said host. Depending on the position of the deletion in pAB 124 pUB 110 s nucleotide structure, the micro organism suitable for transformation by the new deleted plasmid may be, for example, B.subtilis or it may be a thermophilic bacillus such as B stearothermophilus. The insertion of a foreign heterologous DNA fragment into plasmid pAB 124 pUB 110 or plasmids, derived from pAB 124 pUB 110, with part of the nucleotide sequence of pAB 124 pUB 110 deleted, may be performed by any of the methods well known to those skilled in the art. For example by a The terminal transferase procedure, b The restriction enzyme procedure, c The synthetic linker procedure, or d The transformation into a suitable micro organism procedure outlined above. Suitable fragments of heterologous DNA may include, for example, DNA which is significant per se in the medical, industrial or research fields, or DNA which codes for a protein having such significance. Such proteins would include the hormone insulin, a growth hormone, an interferon, a virus antigen, such as hepatitis B virus antigen, and other therapeutically active proteins or peptides. Alternatively, the insertion of the heterologous NNA fragment into pAB 124 pUB 110 or deletion derivatives thereof may yield still further plasmids suitable as transfer vectors. Insertion derivatives of pAB 124 pUB 110 or deletion derivatives thereof should retain the ability to replicate in a suitable host organism and preferably to confer antibiotic resistance especially Tcr, Neo or both onto said host. Further, if the inserted heterologous fragment is a structural gene one which codes for a protein , this gene should be expressed in the host organism. Preferably, when a structural gene is inserted into plasmid pAB 124 pUB 110 or a deletion derivative thereof the reading frame of the structural gene will be in register with the reading frame of pAB 124 pUB 110 or its derivative, and the direction of transcription of the structural gene is the same as the direction of transcription of pAB 124 pUB 110 or its derivative. Most preferably the structural gene is operatively linked to an expression control sequence within pAB 124 pUB 110 or its derivative. Depending on the position of the insertion and on the structure oi the inserted polynucleotide, the micro organism suitable for transformation by the new insertion plasmid derivative of pAB 124 pUB 110 or deletion derivative will be one in which the recombinant DNA plasmid plus insertion replicates and may be one in which the recombinant DNA expresses antibitotic resistance, especially Tc r Neor or both, and, if the heterologous fragment is a structural gene, expresses the structural gene.Preferred micro organisms will be either B subtilis or a thermophilic bacillus such as B stearothermophi7us The plasmids of the present invention, especially pAB 024, pAB 124 pUB 110, pAB 324, pAB 624 and pAB 724, being plasmids with the ability to replicate in a suitable host organism, with the ability to confer antibiotic resistance onto a host organism, and having a large number of single restriction enzyme cleavage sites, many of them in non essential genetic areas of the plasmids, are particularly suitable for use as transfer vectors in recombinant DNA techniques. They may be particularly useful in recombinant DNA processes designed to produce large quantfties of 1 for example, 23A, messenger RNA, tre ssfer RKA or proteins, for use in the medical, industrial or research fieldse The plasmids, processes for preparing said plasmids, and transfoxiilcj ricro orranisms containing said plasmils will now be described by way out example only with reference to the Figur Coils Figure 1 is a restriction enzyme cleavage site map of pAB 324, Figure 2 is a restriction enzyme cleavage site map of pAB 124 pUB 110, Figure 3 is a restriction enzyme cleavage site map of pAB 124, Figure 4 is a restriction enzyme cleavage site map of pUB 110, Figure 5 is a restriction enzyme cleavage site map of pAB 624, Figure 6 is a restriction enzyme cleavage site map of pAB 724S Figure 7 is a restriction enzyme cleavage site map of pAB 024, Figures 1 to 4 and 7 are with reference to the chosen restriction enzymes only, Figures 5 and 6 are with reference. to the chosen restriction enzymes plus Mbo I.Isolation of plasmid DNA from cell cultures i.
