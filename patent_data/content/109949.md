# Apparatus for compensing axial strain in an isostatic press.

## Abstract
An isostatic press acts against a moulding tool 4,5,11,12,32,33 enclosed in the pressing chamber of the press, the cavity 4 of the press tool being defined in the press by an enveloping wall 5 of an elastomeric material and two end walls 11, 33 meeting the enveloping wall 5 . The dry pressing chamber of the press is defined by a radially deformable elastomeric jacket 6 exercising press pressure against the enveloping wall 5 of the moulding tool, and two press end structures 2,3 meeting the pressing chamber jacket 6 and carrying the end walls 33, 11 of the moulding tool. At least one end wall 33, 11 is carried by an adjacent end structure 3,2 via an elastomeric element 31 . The elastomeric element is disposed with its peripheral edge exposed against, and lying adjacent the deformable elas tomeric jacket 6 of the pressing chamber. When the press is pressurized, the jacket 6 will press radially against the elastometic element 31 such that the latter is axially expanded, thereby compensating for the axial strain of the press frame.
