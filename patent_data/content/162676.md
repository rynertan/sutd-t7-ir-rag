# ROLLING APPARATUS

## Abstract
Rolling apparatus, for example for moving semiconduc tor wafers in a clean environment, has a support member with a bearing connected thereto. The bearing is mounted for rotation about its axis relative to the support member. A tyre formed of a material which is softer than the bearing is mounted on its circumference. The tyre has a circumference that increases across its width from a smaller diameter side to a larger diameter side. A lip extends radially inwardly over a portion of the bearing on the larger diameter side of the tyre. The lip is biased against the bearing as the tyre travels, and the tyre is prevented from moving off the bearing at either side.
