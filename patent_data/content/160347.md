# A METHOD AND AN ARRANGEMENT FOR THE APPLICATION OF FILM WRAPPINGS

## Abstract
In the application of preprinted film wrappings around packing containers it is sometimes required that the text or decorative pattern of the wrapping should be located in a certain position in relation to the edges of the finished packing container. One method of application of a film wrapping around an object, e.g. a packing container, makes this possible in that a film web 19 is joined to a waste material web 24 and is advanced with the help of this until the decoration is situated in a predetermined position. Subsequently the packing containers 1 are wrapped whilst the film web 19 is delivered from a film roll 2 whereupon the sealing is performed on a previously unused part of the film web. An arrangement for the realization of the method comprises co operating sealing jaws 15, 16 and a conveyor 5 consisting of two parallel parts.
