# A method for making a device for measuring temperature.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to an apparatus for measuring temperature, comprising a temperature sensitive sensor, whose electric properties, for example, resistance, vary with the temperature, for example, a thermistor 2, 2 , 3 or 3 which is connected to two electric lines 5, 6 , which, in their turn, may be connected to a read off unit for reading off values of current, voltage or the like corresponding to the temperature. The apparatus comprises one or more further sensors 2, 2 , 3 or 3 which, together with the first mentioned sensor, are selected and coupled such that they, at least within a deter mined temperature range, have a value of the above mentioned electric property accurately corresponding to the temperature. In this instance, the sensors are preferably cou pled in series between the above mentioned electric lines 5,6 and are selected such that their deviations from certain determined values have a predetermined value, for example, zero. The disclosure also relates to a method of producing the above defined apparatus, the above mentioned electric property being measured for a large number of sensors and forming the basis of a sorting within accurately determined intervals, whereafter two or more sensors are selected for each apparatus, the sensors, on desired coupling to the elec tric lines, giving a desired value of the above mentioned elec tric property.
