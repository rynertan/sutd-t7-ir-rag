## Description
POLYSULFIDE ALKOXY SLANT COUPLING AGENTS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to sulfur vulcanizable elastomer composites which are based upon vulcanizable unsaturated polymers and copolymers such as natural rubbers, polyisoprenes, polybutadienes, poly butadiene co styrene , poly butadiene co acrylontrile , poly isobutylene cobutadiene, and the like. More particularly, this invention relates to means for enhancing the coupling action, in such sulfur v.lcanizable elastomers, of polysulfie alkoxy silane coupling agents.2. Description of the Prior Art Polysulfide alkoxy silane coupling agents are known, and are described e.g. in U.S. Patents Nos.3,842,111, 3,873,489, 4,003,843, and 4,044,037. Polysulfide functional organosilanes are, like mercapto functional organosilanes, useful as coupling agents in silica filled and silicate filled sulfur vulcanizable elastomer composites.However, the polysulfide functional organosilanes are, as compared to themercapto functional organosilanes, less active. Under comparable conditions, the former produce lesser improvements than do the latter in elastomer vulcanizate properties such as tensile modulus. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that triorganophosphines can be utilized to enhance the coupling action of polysulfide alkoxy silane coupling agents. More specifically, it has been found that compositions which contain triorganophosphine referably in admixture with water1 lower alkanol, and porous inert organic solid carrier can be utilized to enhance the coupling action of polysulfide alkoxy silane coupling agents in the preparation of vulcanizable rubber from formulations comprising a major proportion of vulcaniz able unsaturated polymer or copolymer and a small amount of polysulfide alkoxy silane coupling agent.Also, it has been Sound that compositions which contain a polysulfide alkoxy sflane coupling agent and a triorganophosphine, referably in admixture with water, lower alkanol, and porous inert organic solid can be utilized in the vulcanization of sulfur vulcanizable formulations containing a major proportion of vulcanizable unsaturated polymer or copolymer.The utilization of such compositions improves the elastomer vulcanizate properties as compared to the use of similar compositions without the triorganophosphine. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The sulfur vulcanizable elastomer composites in waich improved coupling action according to the present invention can be obtained are those based upon unsaturated polymers and copolymers such as natural rubbers, polyisoprenes, polybutadienes, poly butadiene co styrene , poly butadieneco acrylonitrile , poly isobutylene co butadiene , and the like. The preferred sulfur vulcanizable elastomer composites are those based upon styrene butadiene copolymers. The polysulfide alkoxy silane coupling agents which can be employed according to the present invention are known as a class and are described, for example in U.S.Patents Nos. 3,842,111, 3,873,489, 4,003,843, and 4,044,037.A preferred variety of these coupling agents is represented by the formulaEMI3.1 wherein X represents an alkoxy radical, R represents an alkyl radical having up to four carbon atoms, y has a value of from 0 to 2 inclusive, R represents a divalent bridging group selected from the group consisting of alkylene and alkyleneoxy radicals having up to seven carbon atoms, n has a value of 0 or 1, p has a value of 0 or 1, Ar represents an aryl radical containing from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, S x represents a divalent polysulfide radical each free valence thereof being directly bonded to an aromatic carbon atom of an Ar radical whereby each Ar radical is bonded to another Ar radical through a S radical, x has a value of from 2 to 6, a has a value of at least 2, b has a value of at least 1, and the ratio of a to b is a value of not more than 2. Illustrative of this preferred variety of coupling agents are the silanes having the formulae CH30 3Si CH2 3 2 Sx wherein x has an average value of about 4, CH30 3Si CH2 3 2 S2i, andEMI4.1 where y has an average value of about 3. The latter silane is most preferred. The organophosphines which can be used according to the present invention are those of the formula R1R2R3P, wherein each R represents an organo radical. The preferred organo radicals are alkyl radicals, especially those having up to eight carbon atoms. Exemplary organophosphines include trimethylphosphine, triethylphosphine, triisopropyl phosphine, triheptylphosphine, etc. The most preferred organophosphine is tri n butylphosphine. The organophosphine additive is conveniently utilized in the form of a dry concentrate. One approach is to stir the organophosphine and water in a lower alkanol,e.g. methanol solvent for a few minutes at room temperature, and then to take up the liquid on a porous inert inorganic solid1 .g. calcium silicate,carrier to form a dry concentrate. The dry concentrate can then be added to sulfur vulcanizable rubber formulations which contain polysulfide silane coupling agent. Another approach is to stir the polysulfide silane coupling agent as well as the organophosphine and water in a lower alkanol,e.g. methanol,solvent for a few minutes at room temperature, and again to take up the liquid on a porous inert organic solid g. calcium silicate,carrier to for a dry concentrate.Said dry concentrate can then be added to sulfur vulcanizable rubber foroula ions. It is believed that the water supplies protons which reduce the polysulfide linkages. The anount of water utilized will be that necessary to obtain the desired rubber curing rate. EXAMPLES The specific examples which follow are illustrative of the principles of the invention. Elastomer Base A typical elastomer base contains 100 parts by weight of SBE 1502, a styrene butadiene copolymer as described in The Elastomers Manual , International Institute of Synthetic Rubber Producers, 1974Edition, page 22 , 50 parts by weight of precipitated high surface area silica, 8 parts by weight of aromatic hydrocarbon oil, 1.0 parts by weight of tetramethylthiuram monosulfide, 1.5 parts by weight of 2 mercaptobenzothiazole, 2.0 parts by weight of sulfur, 5.0 parts by weight of zinc oxide, 1.0 part by weight of stearic acid, and varying parts by weight of additives according to the present invention. The elastomer base is processed as follows The SBR 1502 is banded on a two roll 6 to 12 laboratory 51 C rubber mill at a roll temperature of 1250F and is milled for one minute, dry concentrates according to the present invention are added and dispersed by further milling for about two minutes, half of the silica filler are added followed by the ado ton of the remaining half along with the aromatic hydrocarbon oil, and these components are dispersed by further milling for two to tepee minutes, at which time the remaining vulcanizing chemicals is added and dispersed the mixture so obtained is from the mill as a sheet and is press vulcanized at 320 F to formASTM tensile test sheets Physical tests of the vulcanizate were performed acccrding to standard ASTM test methods. Tensile Modulus Evidence of action by a coupling agent in a composite is manifested through changes in composite physical property values away from the values displayed by the composite in the absence of the agent. Composite properties which may be favorably altered by coupling agent action are many and varied. For example, in elastomeric composites, the effects of coupling agents are seen in terms of increased tensile modulus and abrasion resistance and in decreased hysteresis losses in flexure.In highly extensible elastomeric composites, the measurement of changes in tensile modulus is a particularly useful way of observing coupling effects and has been used extensively in the experimental work described herein. Tensile modulus is defined here as the tensile stress in pounds per square inch of original cross sectional area necessary to produce a selected extension in a composite specimen, usually 100 , 2007., or 300 of the unstressed length these parameters are sually indicated as M100, M200, or M300, resDectively.
