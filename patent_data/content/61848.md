# Fuel heater system and self regulating heater.

## Abstract
A self regulating heater 12 used particularly in an early fuel evaporation system for an automotive engine comprises a thermally conducting metal radiator body 22 of substan tial size and thermal conductivity having a first heat receiving side 24 and having a second, opposite side 26 for transferring heat to a fuel or other heating zone. A thin plate 35 of thermally and electrically conductive metal material has a plurality of self regulating electrical resistance heater discs 36 of a ceramic material of positive tempera ture coefficient of resistivity arranged with one disc side reliably bonded to a first side 35 of the plate in electrically and thermally conducting relation to the plate 35 . The opposite side of the plate 35 is secured in closely spaced, facing, electrically connected relation to the heat receiving side 24 of the radiator 22 for transferring heat to the radiator 22 and for connecting the heater discs 36 to electrical ground through the radiator body 22 . Power supply means are electrically connected to the opposite sides of the heater discs 36 and a thermally conducting filler material 39 is disposed between the opposite plate side 35 and the heat receiving side 24 of the radiator 22 to enhance heat transfer to the radiator body 22 . If desired, a thermally conducting cover cooperates with the radiator body 22 for enclosing the heater discs 36 and a thermally conducting, electrically insulating compound fills the enclo sure to provide improved heat transfer from both sides of the heater discs 36 to the radiator 22 .
