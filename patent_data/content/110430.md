# A METHOD FOR THE TREATMENT AND PACKAGING OF A FOOD PRODUCT

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for the treatment and packaging of a food product, in particular fish, comprising a grinding or breaking down of the product so that it obtains a fluid or semi fluid consistency. To the ground product is added a coagulating substance which consists of sodium alginate. The product is sterilized through the effect of heat, and it is then packed in sterile packages under aseptic conditions. In these packages the product obtains solid consistency as a re sult of the sodium alginate reacting chemically with calcium compounds which contain strongly complex bonded calcium ions and which are added to, or are present in, the product, to form calcium alginate..
