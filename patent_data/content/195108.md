# Embedding medium suitable for the preparation of thin sections of embedded biological materials.

## Abstract
The invention concerns embedding media for producing essentially non polar and polar embedding media. The non polar embedding medium comprises ethyl methacry late, n butyl methacrylate, 1,3 butanediol dimethacrylate, and a small amount of polymerization initiator. The polar embedding medium comprises 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylate, n butyl methacrylate, methoxyethyl methacrylate, ethoxyethyl methacrylate, 1,3 butanediol dimethacrylate, and a small amount of polymerization initiator. The embedding media of the inven tion are particularly suitable for the preparation of a polymer embedded biological material for light or electron micros copy study of thin sections thereof. The embedding mediums can be polymerized at low temperature and UV light employed for initiating polymerization.
