# Image enhancer.

## Abstract
An image enhancer for a color television camera using plural CCD image sensors is proposed, wherein an image of an object on the image sensors for generating the green signal is displaced in the horizontal direction by half the alignment pitch of picture elements relative to the image of the object projected on the image sensors for generating red and blue signals. A vertical image enhancing signal is generated from the green signal only, and a horizontal image enhancing signal is generated from the equally added sum of the green signal and a signal formed of at least the red signal. A composite image enhancing signal is formed by adding the vertical and horizontal image enhancing signals, and is added to the primary color signals.
