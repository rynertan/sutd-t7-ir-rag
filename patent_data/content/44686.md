# Organic electroluminescent cell, process for manufacturing the cell and its use.

## Abstract
Describes an organic electroluminescent cell 10 includ ing an anode electrode 12 , a cathode electrode 22 , and a luminescent zone between said electrodes containing at least one organic luminescent agent and a binder having a breakdown field strength of at least about 10‚Åµ volt cm, wherein a hole injecting zone comprising a layer 18 of a porphyrinic compound is situated between said luminescent zone and said anode electrode. Also relates to a process for manufacturing such cell, characterized by coating the anode electrode with layers constituting the luminescent zone and the hole injecting zone by solvent coating and or vapor deposition techniques and then applying the cathode elec trode. Further relates to the use of the organic electrolu minescent cell for generating light by subjecting said electroluminescent cell to a selected voltage source.
