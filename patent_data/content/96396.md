# Stabilization of polycondensation catalysts.

## Abstract
The process for the stabilization of polycondensation catalysts and the stabilization composition used in such process for producing polyesters and copolyesters by the polycondensation of dicarboxylic acid and an aliphatic glycol using certain metal containing polycondensation catalysts in conjunction with a stabilization composition formed as the reaction product of phosphoric acid, meta phosphoric acid, superphosphoric acid or mixtures thereof and an aliphatic epoxide having between 2 and about 10 carbon atoms.
