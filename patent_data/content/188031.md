## Description
This invention relates to novel substituted phenyl ethers, a process for their preparation, and their use in the preparation of substituted phenols. 4 Trifluoromethylphenol and 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethylphenol are useful intermediates in the preparation of certain substituted phenyl ethers see for example US Specifications 3819755 and 3888932. These phenols are however rather difficult to synthesise, as the trifluoromethyl group tends to be unstable under a wide range of reaction conditions which might normally be used to introduce a hydroxy group into a phenyl ring. Accordingly much research has been devoted to the preparation of these compounds, and many possible routes have been described, see for example French Specification 1469596 and German Patent 1257784. All such processes, however, are either chemically or economically unattractive. The Applicants have now found a reaction which unexpectedly gives a novel intermediate which can be used in the preparation of these substituted phenols. The present invention provides a compound of the general formula Preferably X represents a hydrogen atom, and preferably each of R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ represents a hydrogen atom. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the general formula I, which comprises reacting a compound of the general formula Suitable bases include alkoxides such as sodium or potassium tertiary butoxide alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and quaternary ammonium hydroxides such as sodium or potassium hydroxide and alkali metal hydrides and amides. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a suitable polar aprotic solvent, for example dimethylsulphoxide, sulpholane, a polyether such as dimethoxyethane or the various oligo ethylene glycol bis ethers such as bis 2 methoxyethyl ether diglyme or tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether tetraglyme , or an amide such as dimethyl formamide, dimethyl acetamide, hexamethylphosphoramide or N methylpyrrolidone. Mixtures of solvents may be useful. The reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range of from 70 200 C, especially 100 150 C. The molar ratio of the reactants is not crucial typically the molar ratio of the compound of the general formula II to the compound of the general formula III is in the range of 1 5 to 5 1, preferably 1 3 to 1 1. It is most surprising that the process according to the present invention leads to a compound of the general formula I. It would have been expected that, on the contrary, the isomeric compound containing the group The compound used for the lysis may be water or a mono or poly functional alcohol, for example a sugar, for example galactose or glucose, or an alcohol derived from an alkane having up to 8 carbon atoms, for example ethylene glycol, glycerol, trimethylol ethane, trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol, and monoalkanols having up to 4 carbon atoms. The water or alcohol itself may act as solvent for the reaction, or one or more additional solvents may also be used. Suitable additional solvents include for example hydrocarbons or chlorinated hydrocarbons such as carbon tetrachloride, benzene, toluene or petrol, ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone or acetone, or ethers such as dimethoxy ethane, bis dimethoxyethane ether or tetrahydrofuran. The acid used is not critical mineral acids such as sulphuric, hydrochloric or phosphoric acid, organic acids such as If it is desired to prepare a phenol of the general formula IV in which X is a chlorine atom, this may be done by using as starting material a compound of the general formula I in which X is a chlorine atom. Alternatively, the compound may be prepared by chlorination of the phenol of the general formula IV in which X represents a hydrogen atom. This reaction may be carried out using any suitable chlorinating agent, for example N chlorosuccinimide or elemental chlorine, preferably at a temperature in the range of from 0 150 C, conveniently under reflux or at room temperature. Any suitable solvent may be used, for example a hydrocarbon or chlorinated hydrocarbon such as those listed above. Surprisingly, it has been found that the compound of the formula IV in which X is a chlorine atom, can be obtained easily and in high yield and high purity, if the lysis of the compound of the general formula I is carried out in the presence of an inert organic solvent, preferably a hydrocarbon or a chlorinated hydrocarbon, and in the additional presence of a polyfunctional organic alcohol containing at least two hydroxyl groups, and the resulting reaction mixture is chlorinated The following Examples illustrate the invention. Examples 1 to 8 illustrate the preparation of compounds of the general formula I, while Examples 9 to 16 illustrate the use of these compounds in the preparation of phenols. Example 17 illustrates the conversion of a phenol into its chlorinated analogue.
