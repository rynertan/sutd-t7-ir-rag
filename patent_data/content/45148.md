# Electrode for use in electrolytic cell.

## Abstract
An electrode, suitable for use in an electrolytic cell of the filter press type, and comprising a substantially pianar support member 1 and on at least one face of the support member, and preferably on both faces, a plurality of elongated members 9, 10 for example strips, substantially parallel to each other and each attached at both ends to the support member, a sub stantial part of the elongated members lying in a plane dis placed from and substantially parallel to the support member and the faces of the elongated members lying in planes sub stantially parallel to the plane of the support member. Also an electrolytic cell, incorporating the electrode.
