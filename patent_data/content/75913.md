# Refrigerated transport unit.

## Abstract
Fresh produce is loaded into an enclosed trailer 10 , and the doors closed. Chilled water is pumped through overhead sprinkler pipes 30 to chill the product to about 167 C. The excess water is drained through a special drain at the bottom of the trailer 10 . Liquid nitrogen is used to maintain the trailer 10 cold during transit and storage. Nitrogen tanks within the trailer 10 are filled during the water chill operation. The nitrogen tanks are bled during the filling operation and the bled nitrogen extends through expansion tubes 56 which are located co axially within the water sprinkler pipes 30 in the ceiling. From there the nitrogen is fed through exhaust pipes along the floor of the transport to purge the product of atmosphere and more particularly to purge it of respiration gases. With the transport unit and method fresh produce can be transported efficiently and safely.
