# Improvements in and relating to stranding machines.

## Abstract
A device for use in loading a rotary stranding machine of the so called fork construction comprises an L shaped loading platform 7 located laterally adjacent to the strand ing machine to receive wire supply bobbins resting thereon. The loading platform is mounted for rectilinear upward sliding movement upon mountings 10 which are in turn mounted for pivoting movement about a horizontal axis 11 parallel to the rotary axis of the stranding machine. A jacking means 12 is linked between a fixed anchorage and a part of the loading platform 7 spaced from the horizontal pivotal axis 11 whereby upon extension of the jacking means 12 the loading platform is first tilted about the horizontal axis 11 and then moved rectilinearly to bring the ends of the bobbin 17 into alignment with loading pintles 3 of the stranding machine.
