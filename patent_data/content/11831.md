# Position shift apparatus.

## Abstract
A position shift apparatus having an actuator section for moving up and down a magnetic head 30 through a screw feeding, and a control section 200 in which, when the screw feeding is made in the up direction, it is made by a given distance up to target position and, when in the down direc tion, it is made beyond the target position, and then is again made by the distance exceeding the target position in the up direction. Even if the head 30 is positioned on either the lower or the upper side, the head is screw fed toward the target position always in the up direction.
