## Description
This invention relates to an improved precipitation process for the production of alumina hydrate from Bayer process sodium aluminate liquors. More particularly, it relates to a precipitation process which produces coarse and strong alumina hydrate at high yields while simultaneously achieving energy savings, as well as reduced equipment and operating costs. The Bayer process production of alumina hydrate has been practiced since 1888, and the process involves digestion of bauxite with an aqueous caustic medium at elevated temperatures and pressures. Digestion results in a slurry consisting of a liquor containing the alumina values dissolved from the bauxite in the form of sodium aluminate and a caustic insoluble digestion residue, the so called red mud . The red mud is generally separated from the liquor and the alumina content of the liquor is recovered by precipitation. Precipitation is usually induced by seeding the sodium aluminate liquor with solid alumina hydrate and the precipitated alumina hydrate is recovered. Precipitation of alumina hydrate from the sodium aluminate liquor is an involved operation due to the many process variables and the product quality requirements. The process variables involved in the precipitation step, such as temperature, seed charge, holding time, alumina and caustic concentrations, impurity content, etc., affect product quality and yield, and, consequently, this operation requires close control, as well as a thorough understanding of the precipitation process. The desired characteristics of the alumina hydrate produced by the Bayer process include suitable particle size distribution which is typically measured by screen analysis. To reduce dusting and improve aluminum reduction cell operations, the 325 mesh screen fraction 44 micrometres is used as an industry standard for comparing alumina hydrates for suitability. Generally, only a small quantity of less than 44 micrometres size particles is allowed. Another factor is strength, which is represented by resistance to abrasion during handling and particularly during calcination, again to avoid excessive dusting. In addition to these quality requirements, it is also important that the alumina hydrate produced by precipitation should be recovered at high yields at a minimum of energy input and at the lowest possible capital equipment cost requirement. Energy savings can be achieved, for example, by conducting the precipitation at relatively low temperatures, i.e., below about 68 C 155 F and equipment costs can be minimized by eliminating the need of a cooling stage between precipitation stages and also by reducing the need for costly precipitators and classifiers which separate the coarse alumina hydrate fraction from the fines. Over the years, many efforts were made to improve the precipitation stage of the Bayer process to achieve the above stated goals. In the American Bayer process practice, major emphasis was placed on obtaining a coarse, sandy product of high strength. The yield of alumina hydrate, however, was unsatisfactory. In the European Bayer process practice, the yield of alumina hydrate was relatively high in comparison to the American Bayer process however, the product was too fine and required overcalcination to reduce dustiness. Overcalcination reduces the surface area of the alumina and makes it unsuitable for dry scrubbing in state of the art aluminum reduction facilities. Both processes, the American and the European, had certain advantages, but these advantages were always accompanied by unavoidable difficulties and disadvantages. During the past few years, several proposals were made to combine the advantages of both of these processes without the accompanying disadvantages. Thus, U.S. Patent No. 4,234,559 1980 describes a two stage precipitation method, each stage proceeding within defined temperature ranges, and to each stage, seed alumina hydrate of different particle size distribution is added to induce precipitation. In the first stage, fine seed is added in such an amount as to provide a defined seed surface area to aluminate liquor ratio, expressed in g l supersaturation per m In U.S. Patent No. 4,305,913 1981 , a three stage process is disclosed for the production of coarse and strong alumina hydrate with yields in the range of 70 80 g l. The process also produces a high percentage of coarse material, at least 90 by weight of the product has a size in excess of 45 micrometres. The process disclosed in this patent provides a significant advance in the precipitation art, since it is applicable to both the American and European Bayer processes. The need for three distinct but interconnected stages requires significant capital expenditure in addition, classification associated with each stage adds to processing costs. In DE A 3,324,378 a precipitation process is described wherein coarse alumina hydrate is obtained at reported Al DE C 3,030,631 first publication February 19, 1981 provides a precipitation process wherein the supersaturated sodium aluminate solution is separated into two streams and each of these streams are separately seeded. Extensive recycling to allow sufficient residence time and, consequently, production of coarse agglomerates, is essential in this process, together with the use of a large number of classifiers to reduce the fine fraction in the product alumina hydrate. While the process allows production of coarse alumina hydrate product, it does so at the cost of yield and it also involves increased operating and capital costs. It has now been found the alumina hydrate can be produced in high yields in the form of a coarse and strong product from supersaturated sodium aluminate liquors resulting from both the American and European Bayer processes. The process according to the present invention utilizes a single, relatively small seed charge, which, when added to the entire liquor stream, gives rise to the production of alumina hydrate of the desired quality and yield, without requiring the extensive recyle systems of the prior art or large scale use of interstage cooling and classification equipment. EP A 0102403 describes a continuous process for the extraction of alumina hydrate from Bauxite according to the Bayer process, the process being set out in claim 1 of the document. The present invention provides a process of production of alumina hydrate from supersaturated Bayer process sodium aluminate liquor derived by digesting bauxite with a caustic medium at elevated temperature and pressure which comprises Preferably the average residence time of the solids in step d is from 30 to 90 hours. The invention also provides a process of production of alumina hydrate from supersaturated Bayer process sodium aluminate liquor derived by digesting bauxite with a caustic medium at elevated temperature and pressure, which comprises Preferably the average residence of the solids in step d is from 20 to 60 hours. Advantageously, the particle size distribution of the seed charge introduced into the second stage is such that not more than 12 to 15 weight percent of the particles have a particle size below 44 microns. In either process provided by the invention, a seed charge surface area in the range from 1 to 2.5 m In either process, a temperature in the range from 40 to 680C is advantageously maintained in step c . Both of the preferred embodiments of the process of the invention are described in detail below in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Due to the relatively low temperatures utilized, the process may dispense with the use of interstage cooling and thus can result in significant energy savings. Extensive recycling of alumina hydrate is also eliminated, as well as any large scale use of classification equipment and additional precipitators. This invention relates to the production of a strong, coarse alumina hydrate at high yield from Bayer process sodium aluminate liquors. More particularly, it concerns a process wherein one relatively small, single seed charge is added to relatively cool supersaturated sodium aluminate liquors in a first precipitation line to precipitate a limited quantity of coarse alumina hydrate. The alumina hydrate containing slurry is then transferred to a second precipitation line, where the solids content of the slurry is allowed to increase during a predetermined residence time. In the second precipitation stage, growth and strengthening of the solids take place, resulting in the production of a coarse, strong alumina hydrate product which is recovered at high yield. For the purposes of this invention, the terms supersaturated sodium aluminate liquor or pregnant liquor refer to a sodium aluminate solution which, under the conditions of the present precipitation process temperature, caustic and Al The terms alumina to caustic ratio or A C refer to the quantity of Al The terms precipitation line 1 or first precipitation stage refer to one or several parallelly arranged precipitation vessels, each of which is charged with pregnant liquor and also charged with seed to induce precipitation. The terms precipitation line 2 or second precipitation stage refer to at least one, preferably several, precipitation vessels connected in series. In the process of the present invention, the pregnant liquor utilized in the precipitation system is generated by the digestion of bauxite. The bauxite employed in the digestion can be of any desired source, thus bauxites mined in the United States, the Caribbean, South America, Africa, Australia, Asia, and Europe, can be equally employed for the generation of pregnant liquors. The digestion conditions utilized for the production of the pregnant liquor can be the conventionally used American or European Bayer process conditions. With regard to the A C ratios and caustic concentrations employed in the digestion stage, the conventionally utilized alumina and caustic concentrations are acceptable. Thus, the entire range of A C ratios commonly used in both the American and European practices apply, i.e., A C ratios within the range of 0.575 and 0.700, at caustic concentration values within the limits from about 165 to about 300 g l can be utilized for the generation of the pregnant liquor employed in the precipitation system of the present invention. In the following, the novel aspects of the precipitation process of the present invention will be explained in detail and with reference to the Figures. It is to be understood, however, that the schematic flowsheets shown in the Figures are for illustrative purposes only. It is not intended to limit the scope of the invention by simply referring to these. As shown in Figure 1, pregnant liquor from the digestion stage of the Bayer process is charged to a first precipitation stage. This first precipitation stage can consist of a single precipitation vessel, or if desired, of several precipitator vessels arranged in parallel relationship to each other. The pregnant liquor charged to the first precipitation line has an A C ratio within the range from about 0.575 to about 0.700 and its caustic concentration is within the limits from about 165 g l to about 300 g l, preferably from about 175 g l to about 250 g l. The liquor charged to the first precipitator line is seeded with a charge of alumina hydrate seed to induce precipitation of dissolved alumina from the pregnant liquor. The seed to be charged to the first precipitation stage has to meet certain specifications in accordance with the present invention. In the first instance, the seed should have a large fraction of fine particles, preferably up to about 50 70 by weight of the seed to be charged to the first precipitation stage should have a particle size below about 44 micrometres 0.044 mm . The seed surface area to the pregnant liquor volume ratio is of prime importance for the purposes of this invention. While in conventional Bayer process precipitation practice the seed surface area to pregnant liquor volume is kept as high as possible and at not less than 6 m The temperature, where the seeding of the pregnant liquor is accomplished in accordance with the present process, is kept below about 68 C 155 F and generally within the range from about 40 C to about 68 C. The average residence time of the seeded pregnant liquor in the first precipitation stage is usually in the range from about 90 minutes to about 300 minutes. This average residence time at the given seed charge to liquor ratio and temperature range results in the precipitation of about 30 to 40 g l alumina hydrate. During the time period referred to hereinabove, the precipitation vessel s may be agitated in a conventional manner, for example, by mechanical or air agitation, to achieve maximum contact of the low seed charge with the pregnant liquor. From the first precipitation stage, the produced slurry is then introduced into the second precipitation line or stage. This precipitation stage can, as shown, consist of several precipitation vessels all arranged in series. Also, depending upon the number of first stage precipitation vessels employed in parallel, a number of second precipitation lines may be used in parallel, each line consisting of several vessels in series. The number of precipitation vessels used in both the first and second stages depends upon the Bayer process liquor volumes generated by the plant, the availability of vessels and other economic and operational considerations. This facet of the precipitation process is within the skill and knowledge of the practitioner. For the sake of ready understanding, this description, as indicated in Figure 1, will only consider a single first stage precipitation vessel and a second precipitation stage consisting of several precipitation vessels connected in series. Slurry from the first precipitation stage is charged to the second precipitation stage where the solids content of the slurry is allowed to increase from the initial 30 40 g l to 250 700 g l by the dual effect of further precipitation and accumulation of hydrate from the first stage. This is suitably accomplished by well known techniques employed in the Bayer process. The average residence time of the solids in the second precipitation stage is within the range from about 30 to 90 hours. During this residence time, agglomeration and coarsening of the alumina hydrate takes place resulting in a strong, coarse product. The temperature in the second precipitation stage is kept within the range from about 40 to about 55 C. If the temperature in the second precipitation stage approximates the temperature maintained in the first stage, cooling will not be required when slurry is being transferred from one vessel to another within the second precipitation stage. If a significant temperature drop is desired between the individual precipitation vessels of the second precipitation line for optimization of the process, then so called interstage cooling may be employed. However, the instant invention operating at relatively low precipitation temperatures allows, if so desired, the elimination of the need for interstage or intervessel cooling and thus can result in significant energy savings. From the last precipitation vessel of the second precipitation stage, the high solids content slurry is introduced into a classifier where classification of the solids by particle size takes place. Due to the novel use of low seed charge in the first precipitation stage, in combination with the high solids second stage precipitation line, the process results in an alumina hydrate product which consists of at least about 90 , preferably 95 , by weight of coarse, strong particles having a particle size in excess of 44 micrometres in a yield based on the Al From the classification stage, the overflow, containing the fine fraction, is introduced into a clarifier settler where the slurry is allowed to settle in order to separate the finely divided alumina hydrate particles from the spent Bayer process liquor. The spent liquor, having an A C ratio in the range from about 0.350 to about 0.375 is recycled to the Bayer process after its caustic concentration is increased, for example, by evaporation and or addition of caustic. The fine alumina hydrate discharged in the underflow from the settler is subjected to a washing treatment to remove adhered impurities therefrom. The washed hydrate is then employed as seed for precipitation of alumina hydrate in the first precipitation stage of the instant process. The process of the present invention involving the use of a relatively small seed charge in the first precipitation stage can also be advantageously employed in conventional batch or continuous precipitation systems where under the known precipitation conditions excessive production of finely divided alumina hydrate occurs. As mentioned hereinbefore, many conventional precipitation processes produce a large fraction of fines and or weak alumina hydrate which necessitates extensive recycling of the slurry and the large scale utilization of classification apparatus, both of which result in operational difficulties and significantly increased operating and capital expenditures. To minimize these disadvantages, it has been found that the process of the invention can be adapted to conventional precipitation systems where multiple seeding is utilized. Thus, as shown in Figure 2, in a first precipitation stage, only a small quantity of seed is added to the pregnant liquor and then the produced slurry is introduced into a second precipitation line as taught by the present invention. In the second precipitation stage, accumulation of the solids content is achieved in accordance with the invention, however, reduction of fine particle generation and production can be achieved by recycling a portion of the medium sized alumina hydrate particles to at least one, preferably to more, precipitation vessels in the second precipitation stage. These particles are cemented and strengthened along with the coarse agglomerates generated in the second stage, thus producing strong alumina hydrate products in addition to reducing the overall quantity of fines. As shown in Figure 2, in the event the inventive process is employed in combination with conventional precipitation systems, the high solids content slurry discharged from the second precipitation line is subjected to a classification step primary thickener to separate the product alumina hydrate from the fine fraction. The overflow slurry from the thickener containing the finer fraction is then subjected to a second thickening step and the underflow containing slightly coarsened but still fine alumina hydrate is recycled to the second precipitation stage as seed to aid in precipitation and accomplish cementation. The overflow slurry is charged to a third thickener from where the underflow, consisting of alumina hydrate of fine particle size, is subjected to a washing step and the washed hydrate is used as seed in the first precipitation stage in accordance with the process of the present invention. The following examples are given to further facilitate the understanding of the invention. Pregnant Bayer process liquor having an A C ratio of 0.675 and a caustic concentration expressed as g l Na The product hydrate recovered from the classification stage was analyzed for particle size distribution and strength. It was found that about 95 by weight of the product hydrate consisted of particles having a size in excess of 44 micrometres and the attrition test of the product hydrate indicated high strength. Only a very small portion of the hydrate suffered attrition when subjected to an attrition test. The yield of product hydrate from the precipitation was 80.5 g l based on the alumina Al In this example, the beneficial effects of the process of the invention on a conventional precipitation system are shown. In the conventional system, unacceptable quantities of fine, weak alumina hydrate particles less than 44 micrometres size are produced unless the produced fine hydrate is recycled in large quantities to the precipitation stage to allow agglomeration and growth. To avoid the need for such extensive recycle and associated operational and capital costs, the conventional precipitation system, involving addition of seed in more than one stage, was combined with the precipitation process of the present invention. The novel process utilizing a single, relatively small seed charge in a first precipitation stage in contact with the entire pregnant liquor stream is established, as shown in Figure 2, ahead of the conventional system. Thus, pregnant liquor having an A C ratio of 0.700 and a caustic concentration of 215 g l was contacted with a charge of fine alumina hydrate seed. The fine alumina hydrate seed contained about 45 by weight particles having an average particle size below 44 micrometres. The pregnant liquor kept at 68 C 155 F was seeded in a first precipitation stage with sufficient seed to obtain an approximately 2 m The product hydrate recovered from the primary thickener was obtained in a yield in excess of about 75 g l the major improvement observed by the combination described resulted in the reduction of the overall fine particle generation. It was found that the fine particle generation of the combined process was substantially less in comparison to the conventional precipitation process. The combination shown resulted in a total fine particle content reduction of about 10 . In addition, the produced product hydrate had high strength characterized by at least about a 10 increase in attrition resistance.
