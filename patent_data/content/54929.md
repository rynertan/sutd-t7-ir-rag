# Method of controlling electromechanical actuator in camera and such camera.

## Abstract
To control an electromechanical actuator in a camera from a digital computer without an expensive digital to analog conversion device, a series of electrical pulses are created and the duty cycle is varied in accordance with the computer output. The resulting signal is then applied to an electromechanical actuator which responds to the average current of the signal. An actuator controllable by such a method is of the type having a planar coil 22 mounted on an arma ture 20 for rotation in the plane of the coil. To reduce friction and reduce parts, the armature 20 is mounted on a flexure spring 26 which urges the armature 20 toward its initial position.
