# Apparatus for detecting the imminent occurrence of an event.

## Abstract
Apparatus for detecting, in advance, by a desired length of time, the imminent failure of electric output power provided by an electric power supply due to the reduction or loss of input power. The magnitude of the voltage on an energy storage reservoir capacitor is monitored for deriving a voltage signal proportional to the rate of change thereof. The rate of change voltage Vc is multiplied 35 by a voltage VWT proportional to a desired early warning time interval and this product is added to a voltage Vm propor tional to a minimum vlaue of voltage on the capacitor, thus representing an amount of stored energy sufficient to sus tain normal output power for a desired time interval. The voltage derived by the adding means is compared 38 with the voltage on the energy storage capacitor for signalling imminent power supply failure when the compared voltages are equal.
