## Description
Ceramic engine part with improved abrasion resistance The present invention relates to a ceramic engine part and, more particularly, to a ceramic engine part which is excellent in abrasion resistance. Metal engine parts are currently used for vehicles. However, studies for using ceramic engine parts are bein made in order to make an engine lighter and more efficie t. However, no decisive conclusion has been made as to which ceramic is best suited for engine parts of vehicles. It is an object of the preset invention to provide an engine part which is made of a ceramic. It is another object of the present invention to provide a ceramic engine part which is excellent in abrasion resistance. In order to achieve the above and other objects, there is provided according to the present invention an engine part at least portion of which is a sintered body mainly comprising zirconia and yttria, yttria being contained in the sintered body. in an amount of 0.1 to 15 moQZ with respect to the total of zirconia and yttria, and which has a surface roughness of 5S or less, a fracture toughnes KIC of 6 to 15 MPa m1 2, a porosity of 10 o cr less, and a grain size of 5 um cr less. The present inventors have made various studies and have conducted various experiments in an attempt to search for a ceramic suited for engine parts for vehicles. As a result of such studies and experiments, an yttria Y2O3 stabilized zirconia sintered body or a sintered body of zirconia containing, in the form of a solid solution, yttria in an amount of 0.1 to 15 more and, preferably 2 to 4 more and having predetermined surface roughness, fracture toughness, porosity and grain size was found to have excellent mechanical strength and abrasion resistance and to be suited for an engine part. The surface of the yttri stabilized zirconia sintered body according to the present invention is smoother than those of many other ceramics. The sintered body of the present invention has a surface roughness of 5S or less. For this reason, unnecessary surface processing need not be performed, resulting in less friction and better abrasion resistance. The yttria stabilized zirconia sintered body of the present invention has a fracture toughness KIC of 6 to 15 xSpaXml 2 and is thus best suited for engine parts among various ceramics. Since the yttria stabilized zirconia sintered body of the present invention has a porosity of 10 or less, it may be conveniently used at a part where it is brought into contact with a metal part. Abraded powder of the metal is accomodated within the micropores in the sintered body, so that an increase in the coefficient of friction may be prevented Since the yttria stabilized zirconia sintered body of the present invention has a grain size of 5 pm or less, grain separation does not occur when an external force acts thereon. When the sintered body is used as an engine part, this leads to an advantage of easy prevention of a decrease in efficiency, which may ctherwise be caused by an increase in the clearance due to abrasion wear. In addition to these advantages, the yttriastabilized zirconia sintered body of the present invention has a composite crystal system of the cubic system and the tetragonal system. A solid solution having such a crystal system does not undergo a transformation due to thermal or mechanical energy in the engine cycle and can be used as a stable engine part. The yttria stabilized zirconia sintered body of the present invention has a coefficient of thermal expansion which is closer to those of metals than other ceramics. For example, a sirtered body may be provided which expands substantially linearly as a function of temperature within a temperature range of 25 to 1,3000C. This sintered body may have a coefficient of thermal expansion which is closer to those of metals than other ceramics. For this reason, even if the sintered body of the present invention is used together with the metal parts, damage due to heat as in other ceramics may not be caused. Thermal conductivity of the yttria stabilized zirconia sintered body of the present invention can be set to 1 to 5 W m.0C. Therefore, better heat insulation and corsustion efficiency may be obtained when the sintered body is used as an engine part. The mechanical strength of the yttria stabilized zirconia sintered body can be set to be within the range of 200 to 1,500 MPa, thus satisfying the strength requirement for an engine part. The yttria stabilized zirconia sintered body of the present invention has a thermal shock resistance such that a critical thermal shock temperature difference ATc is 300 to 500 C. The sintered body can be used for an engine part which is subjected to a great temperature gradient. The sintered body has a Young s modulus as small as 150 to 250 GPa which is close to those of metal engine parts. The sintered body of the present invention thus provides excellent compatibility with metal engine parts. The yttria stabilized zirconia sintered body has a density as high as 5.3 to 2.9 x 103 kg m3. This results in an improved abrasion resistance, a longer service life and better reliability of the engine when the sintered body is used as an engine part. The yttria stabilized zirconia sintered body as described above has an excellent specific wear volume of 1 x 10 6mm3 kgf mm or less when it is subjected to an abrasion resistance test with a steal member under lubrication. When the sintered body is used as a tappet, an opening or closing timing delay of the valve may not be caused even after a prolonged period of time. Since the sintered body does not react with metals, it can withstand sliding movement over a long period of time. The yttria stabilized zirconia sintered body has a coefficient of friction of 0.7 or less with a steel member. Therefore, energy loss due to friction may be reduced to the minimum, and the combustion efficiency may be improved. Sintered bodies of zirconia are generally reinforced by ageing. However, when a sintered body of zirconia contains yttria in the form of a solid solution, reinforcement may be achieved only by sintering and does not require ageing. For this reason, drawbacks of the engine parts such as deformation due to the ageing or non uniform precipitation by non uniform heat treatment may be prevented. The sintered body of the present invention is moreover preferable in that the additional step such as ageing is not required. When the yttria stabilized zirconia sintered body of the present invention is subjected to a processing of a relatively great surface roughness instead of repeated processing of a relatively small surface roughness as in the other ceramics, degradation in the mechanical strength is not caused. For this reason, the processing may be performed faster, and a sintered body of desired shape may be manufactured fast, resulting in industrial advantage. The sintered body of the present invention allows various types of processing such as diamond and stone grinding, ultrasonic processing, and laser processing. The mechanical strength of the yttria stabilized zirconia sintered body can be set to be higher than that of an alumina type ceramic and is suitably adapted for an engine part which is subjected to more severe conditions than those other ceramics can withstand. The yttria stabilized zirconia sintered body of the present invention is chemically stable, is easy to handle with, and does not impose a special requirement on assembly of the engine parts. Since the yttria stabilized zirconia sintered body is an oxide, it is excellent in oxidation resistance and is thus preferable as an engine part. The yttria stabilized zirconia sintered body of the present invention is most preferably manufactured by precipitating a coprecipitate of zirconium and yttrium from a solution containing zirconium ions and yttrium ions, drying the coprecipitate at a low temperature to provide a mixture containing zirconia and yttria, and sintering the mixture. This invention can be more fully understood rom the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing, in which Fig. 1 shows an engine of a vehicle. As has been described above, an yttria stabilized zirconia sintered body consists of yttria and zirconia.Yttria is contained in the amount of 0.1 to 15 mo and preferably 2 to 4 more An engine part must have a good abrasion resistance. In order to satisfy this requirement, the yttriastabilized zirconia sintered body has a surface roughness of 5S or less and preferably 2S or less, a fracture toughness of 6 to 15 MPa ml 2 and preferably 8 to 15 MPa, a porosity of 10 or less and preferably 1 or less, and a grain size of 5 pm or less and preferably 2 vm or less. The yttria stabilized zirconia sintered body is most preferably manufactured in the manner to be described below. First, an yttrium compound, which may be converted into an oxide upon heating, such as yttrium nitrate, is mixed with a zirconium compound, which may also be converted into an oy.ide upon heating, such as zirconyl chloride, in such a manner that yttria is contained in a predetermined ratio in the final oxide product. The mixture obtained is dissolved in a hydrochloric acid solution and is mixed well. Ammonia is added to this solution to precipitate a coprecipitate containing zirconium and yttrium.The coprecipitate is dried at a low temperature of 150 to 4000C to prepare a mixture containing ZrO2 and Y2O3. The mixture is pulverized, is formed into a predetermined shape at a pressure of 300 to 2000 kg cm2 by an isotactic press e.g., a rubber press , and is sintered at a temperature of 1450 to 16500C. The crystal system of the sintered body thus obtained is mainly comprised of a composite crystal system of the cubic system and the tetragonal system.Monoclinic system may be present in a small amount. The sintered body thus obtained is processed by diamond griping, laser processing or the like to provide a desired engine part. In order to provide an engine part of better quality, the sintered body of the present invention has one or more of the properties to be shown below General range Preferable rangeCoefficient of 8 13 x 10 6 9 11 x 10 6 thermal expansionThermal conduc 1 5 W m0C 1.5 3 W m C tivityFlexural 200 1500 MPa 600 1500 MPa strengthCritical thermal 300 5000C shock temperature differenceYoung s modulus 150 250 GPa 180 250 GPaDensity 5.3 6.2 x 103.kg m3 6.0 6.2 x 103kg m3Specific wear 1 x 10 6mm3 kgf mm 1 x 10 8mm3 kgf mm volume with or less or less steel member under lubricationCoefficient of 0.7 or less 0.5 or less friction with a metal member The sintered body of the present invention may be conveniently used for a cylinder 2, a cylinder liner not shown , a piston 4, a piston cap 6, a suction valve 8, an exhaust valve 10, a precotbustion chamber 12, a cam 14, a tappet 16, a fuel injection pump 18, a bearing 20, a push rod 22, or a rotor 24 of the engine 1 as shown in Fig. 1.Examples Zirconyl chloride and yttrium nitrate were mixed such that the final oxide may contain yttria in the amount indicated in Table below. After the mixture obtained is dissolved in a hydrochloric acid solution and is well mixed, ammonia was added to the solution to prepare a coprecipitate containing zirconium and yttrium. The coprecipitate was dried at a low temperature to prepare a ZrO2 Y203 containing mix. The mix was pulverized and then was formed into a pressed product with an isotactic press.
