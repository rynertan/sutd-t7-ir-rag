# Vacuum tight assembly.

## Abstract
A vacuum tight assembly, such as a discharge tube 10 for a sodium vapor arc lamp, includes a high density polycrystalline ceramic body, such as alumina or yttria, having a cavity 12 and at least one closure member 14 and a sealing material 24 for sealing the cavity 12 from the atmosphere. The closure member 14 is formed from a molybdenum alloy containing titanium, vanadium, chro mium or mixtures thereof. The closure member 14 and the sealing material 24 have thermal coefficients of expansion closely matched to the thermal coefficient of expansion of the ceramic body over a wide temperature range. In a preferred embodiment, an alumina discharge tube 10 is sealed by a closure member 14 formed from a molybde num alloy containing 50 atom percent titanium.
