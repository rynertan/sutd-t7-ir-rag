The microorganisms according to the invention, including new species Nocardia sp. YS 02931, are collected from soil. An example of the new species of microorganism according to the invention is Nocardia sp.YS 02931K, which is a type strain of the species. The species and strain designations YS 02931 and YS 02931K used herein are our temporary informal nomenclature pending allocation of formal permant names. Bacteriological properties of the type strain Nocardia sp.YS 02931K, are described below. 1. Morphology Nocardia sp. YS 02931K strain forms no aerial mycelium when grown on organic or inorganic agar media. When grown on a favorable medium, its basal hyphae are comparatively long and grow straight with irregular branching, but some times extend in a zig zag way. Round protrusions like wens are often observed at the top of basal hyphae, indicating their growth by acrope tal budding. Spores are elliptical in shape and have smooth surfaces, each measuring 0.8 L 1.2 x 2.0 3.5 mm, and part of hyphae tend to break in the later stage of culture, showing a bacillary shape. Presence of verticil late spores, sclerotium like structure, sporangia and zoo spores was not detectd. The species is negative to acid fast staining. 2.

Analysis of Cell Wall Composition The cell wall composition of Nocardia sp. YS 02931K and the acid hydrolyzate of the whole cell body were analyzed according to the method of Lechevallier et al. Lechevallier, Mp. et al. PP227 238 in Dietz, A et al. ed., Actinomycetes Taxonomy. SIM special publication No.6, 1980 .Presence of meso diaminopimelic acid and galactose was proved, but arabinose, which is characteristic of type IV cell walls, was detected only in a very small amount. To sum up, YS 02931K strain does not form aerial mycelium at all when grown on various media its basal hyphae generally grow straight but sometimes extend in a zig zag way, with protrusions like wens often observed at its top, indicating their growth by acropetal budding spores are elliptical in shape and are formed basipetally in positions slightly apart from the top of hyphae part of hyphae tend to break in the later stage of culture, but only to a limited extent. The analytical result on the compositions of cell walls and sugars involved suggests that this microorganism falls in the category of type IV cell wall though only little arabinose was detected . No sporangium or mobile spore was detected. Judging from the morphological properties and cell wall type, species YS 02931 might belong to either genus Nocardia or Pseudonocardia. It is similar to the species of Pseudonocardia in that its hyphae grow by acropetal budding, its spores are elliptical in shape, and its basal hyphae sometimes extend in a zig zag way. However, it forms no aerial mycelium, while the species of Pseudonocardia generally show deposition of white mycelia, in powdery form or in thick layers, on the basal hyphae. In addition, the species of Pseudonocardia have no ability to decompose starch, or to peptonize or coagulate nonfat milk, unlike YS 02931. Taking these facts into consideration, it seems reasonable to consider that the new microorganisms belong to the morphological group III ofNocardia as specified in Bergey s Manual of DeterminativeBacteriology, 8th edition 1974 . Since they are not identical to any species in this group, we identified them as a new species of Nocardia and named it Nocardia sp. YS 02931, and the type strain YS 02931K has been deposited at theFermentation Research Institute under Agency of IndustrialScience and Technology as FERM PNo.7962.Clearly, other microorganisms of genus Nocardia having the characteristic bacteriological properties of strain YS 02931K belong to the novel species designated YS 02931. Microorganisms are generally subject to natural and artificial mutation the invention includes strains isolated from the natural environment, strains derived by artificial variation e.g. by the action of UV rays, X rays or chemical agents, and natural mutants e.g. natural and artificial mutants and derivatives of type strain YS 12931K . YS 02931 K substance can be obtained by growing Nocardia YS 02931 in a suitable medium. Any commonly used culture method may be employed, but submerged culture in a liquid medium is normally preferable. Any culture media containing nutrients assimilable byNocardia YS 02931 may serve the purpose. These include synthetic, semi synthetic and natural media, which contain glucose, arabinose, fructose, starch, vegetable oil, etc., as carbon source and meat extract, peptone, gluten meal, cottonseed oil cake, soybean meal, peanut meal, fish meal, corn steep liquor, dry yeast, yeast extract, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, urea, etc., as nitrogen source. Salts of Na, K, Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe and other metals sulfates, nitrates, chlorides, carbonates, phosphates, etc. may also be contained as required. These culture media may also include, as necessary, an accelerator for antibiotic formation or a defoamer, such as methionine, cysteine, cystine, thiosulfates, methyl oleate, lard oil, silicone oil and surface active agents. Fermentation under aerobic conditions is generally advantageous, and should preferably be carried out at about 18 to 350C most preferably at about 300C . pH of the medium is best held in the range from. about 5 to 10, more preferably from about 5 to 7, to obtain satisfactory results. YS 02931K substance can be isolated by known methods commonly used for isolation of antibiotics from microbial cultures. This substance, produced principally in the culture liquid, is isolated by first removing the microbial cells by centrifugation or filtration, followed by extraction of the effective compound from the supernatant or filtrate. Isolation and purification can be effected by known techniques commonly employed for the manufacture of antibiotics those utilizing difference in various properties, such as solubility, precipitation, adsorption and distribution between two liquid phases , which may be used alone, in any desired combinations, or repeatedly. The invention is further illustratec by the following example. Example Culture medium pH 7.1 containing 3.08 potato starch, 1.5 soybean meal, 0.5 corn steep liquor, 0.2 yeast extract, 0.05 magnesium sulfate hepta hydrate, 0.3 sodium chloride and 0.002 cobalt chloride hexahydrate was prepared. This medium was dispensed into 500ml conical flasks 60 ml in each and sterilized at 1200C for 20 minutes. A pinch of hyphae of Nocardia sp. YS 02931K strain grown on Bennett s agar medium was added to the sterile medium prepared above, and subjected to shake cul ture at 270C for 72 hours to make a master culture.Twen ty five liters of culture medium of the same composition as above and also containing 0.03 Adekanol product of Asahi Denka Xogyo was placed in a 30 liter stainless steel fermentor, and the master culture obtained above was charged in an amount of 3.0 . Fermentation was continued at 28.0 28.50C for 72 hours aeration 20 1 mien agitation 95 150 rpm , when the maximum activity against Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 strain was achieved. Radiolite 600 product of Showa Chemical Industry was added to the culture liquid and the mixture was stirred well and filtered, giving 20 liters of filtrate. It was adjusted to pH 3 by addition of 0.1N HCl, 20 liters of ethyl acetate was added, the mixture was thoroughly agitated, and the organic layer was col lected.The ethyl acetate solution thus obtained was treated with 3 liters of 18 NaHC03 solution, and the aqueous layer was collected and acidified to pH 3 with 0.1N HCl. Three liters of ethyl acetate was added, the mixture was stirred well, and the organic layer was collected and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After filtering off the drying agent, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, leaving about 1 g of orange oil. It was dis solved in a small amount of chloroform, the chloroform solution was adsorbed on 50 g of Wakogel C 200 Wako Jun yaku packed in a column, and the adsorbed matters were chromatographed using chloroform methanol 100 1 as de veloping solution. The fractions showing activity against Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 re collected and concentrated under reduced presure, giving 70 mg of yellow oil.It was dissolved in a small quantity of methanol, the methanol solution was applied to a silica gel 60F254 thin layer plate Merck along its edge, and thin layer chromatography was performed using chloroform methanol 7 1 as developing solution. The portion which showed an Rf value of 0.34 and exhibited activity against Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 was scraped off, the collected silica gel powder was treated with chloroform methanol 7 1 , and the eluate thus ob tained was concentrated under reduced presure, affording 4 mg of pure YS 02931K p substance as yellow powder. As indicated above, in the accompanying drawings Figure 1 shows the ultraviolet absorption spectrum of YS 02931K p substance, Figure 2 its infrared ab sorption spectrum, and Figure 3 its NMR spectrum.
