# FUEL CELL SYSTEM FOR MOBILE APPLICATIONS AND PROCESS IN WHICH FUEL PROCESS GAS AND OXIDANT PROCESS GAS ARE INTRODUCED INTO ANODE AND CATHODE SECTIONS, RESPECTIVELY, OF A FUEL CELL

## Abstract
A fuel cell system wherein a fuel conditioner supplied with fuel and with exhausted cathode gas is adapted to partially oxidize a portion of the fuel with the cathode exhaust gas and to utilize at least the water in the oxidation products and at least the water in the cathode exhaust gas to steam reform a portion of the fuel to produce fuel process gas.
