# Two circuit fluid pressure control valves.

## Abstract
A dual circuit foot valve for a compressed air braking system has a plunger 38 which acts through a spring 39 on a first piston 6 which carries an exhaust seat for a first double valve controlling the supply of pressure from an input port 27 to a first circuit delivery port 28 , the delivered pressure at 28 acting beneath the piston 6 in a sense to cause lapping of the valve and also acting above a second piston 16 which similarly acts as a control piston for a further double valve controlling the supply of pressure from an input port 29 to a second circuit delivery port 30 , a further spring 43 being carried within the piston 6 to be engageable with a projection 55 of the second piston 16 following operation of the plunger to act on the second piston to beneficially influence the differential between the two delivered pressures.
