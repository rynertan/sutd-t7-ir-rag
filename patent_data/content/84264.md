# Molded high voltage splice body.

## Abstract
A method for making a molded high voltage splice body by positioning a conductive elastomeric electrode on a mandrel, positioning an extruded conductive elastomeric sleeve over the elastomeric electrode, sealing the ends of the elastomeric sleeve, placing the mandrel with the electrode and sleeve on it into a mold, injecting a curable insulating compound between the electrode and the sleeve under pressure and curing the insulating compound.
