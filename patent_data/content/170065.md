## Description
MOLDED ELECTRICAL DEVICE AND COMPOSITION THEREFORE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to a molded electrical device comprising an electrically conductive pathway and an insulating material, the device being capable of interconnection with external circuitry, said insulating material comprising a blend of a particular amorphous thermoplastic polymer and a particular crystalline thermoplastic polymer. Also, this invention is directed to a composition suitable for use as an insulating material in an electrical device comprising from about 35 to about 65 weight percent of an amorphous polymer selected from a polyarylethersulfone resin, a polyarylether resin, a polyetherimide, or a polyarylate and from about 65 to about 35 weight percent of a crystalline polymer selected from a poly arylene sulfide a polyester, or a polyamide. It is well known that a wide variety of thermoplastic polymers have been used as substrates for electrical components, such as circuit board substrates. These substrates have been molded from, for example, polyphenyleneoxide, polyphenylenesulfide, polyimide and polyethersulfone. Additionally, the following U.S.Patent Applications disclose substrates made from thermoplastic polymers U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 516,863, filed in the name of J.E. Harris et al, on July 25, 1983, titled A Composition Useful For Making Circuit Board Substrates and Electrical Connectors commonly assigned describes a composition useful for making circuit board substrates and electrical connector comprising a blend of certain proportions of a poly ether.sulfone and a polysulfone. U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 566,298, filed in the name of H. Cheo et al, on December 28, 1983, titled A Polymer Useful For Molding Into ACircuit Board Substrate commonly assigned describes a select polyarylethersulfone which is useful for molding into circuit board substrates. U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 448,376, filed in the name of J.E. Harris, on December 9, 1982, titled A Composition Useful For MakingCircuit Board Substrates Andlor ElectricalConnectors commonly assigned describes a composition comprising a blend of a poly aryl ether , a poly etherimide polymer, a fiber and a filler which is useful for making circuit board substrates and or electrical connectors. The polymers described above are used as circuit board substrates and in other electrical devices such as chip carriers. These materials are solderable by hand or wave soldering techniques.However, unlike hand and wave soldering, vapor phase soldering VPS constitutes a considerably more rigorous form of thermal exposure as, for example, temperatures of about 4200F, and times of exposure of the substrate of from 30 seconds to in excess of 2 minutes . Unlike wave soldering which involves momentary exposure of the device to temperatures of 5000F, VPS requires that the electrical device be corresponding to European patent application 83 112 378.1 totally immersed in the soldering media. Thus amorphous resin containing formulations that performed satisfactorily in hand and wave soldering exhibit deficiencies upon VPS exposure, i.e., they exhibit bubbles, blisters, distortion, and foaming.This is attributed to relatively high moisture absorption and low apparent modulus at the VPS processing temperature of the substrate made from amorphous resins. Crystalline resin systems, on the other hand, have been found to exhibit low moisture absorption and a relatively high modulus at VPS processing temperatures. For example, mineral and or glass filled relnforced poly ethylene terephthalate has demonstrated exceptional resistance to bubbling, blistering, and foaming inVPS exposure. However, while possibly suited for making small articles such as chip carriers, filled reinforced poly ethylene terephthalate systems are unacceptable for printed wiring board fabrication due to anisotropic behavior which results in severe bow and warp of the fabricated wiring board. Thus, there is a desire to develop a resin formulation which can be used to fabricate a large variety of molded electrical devices requiringVPS exposure and which maintain their dimensional integrity after VPS exposure. THE INVENTION In the present invention it has been found that the combination of a particular amorphous thermoplastic polymer and a particular crystalline thermoplastic polymer provides a material which is useful as an electricalisupport element in electrical devices, is vapor phase solderable, and maintains its dimensional integrity. The present invention is also directed to a molded electrical device comprising an electrically conductlve pathway and an insulating material, the device being capable of interconnection with external circuitry, said insulating material comprising a blend of a particular amorphous thermoplastic polymer and a particular crystalline thermoplastic polymer. Further, this invention is directed to a composition suitable for use as an insulating material in an electrical device comprising from about 35 to about 65 weight percent, preferably from about 40 to about 60 weight percent, and most preferably about 50 weight percent, of an amorphous thermoplastic polymer selected from a polyarylethersulfone, a polyarylether resin, a polyetherimide, or a polyarylate, and from about 65 to about 35 weight percent, preferably from about 40 to about 60 weight percent, and most preferably about 50 weight percent of a crystalline polymer selected from a poly arylene sulfide , a polyester, or a polyamide. Preferred compositions include blends of polyarylethersulfone with poly arylene sulfide or polyesters or polyamides or mixtures of one or more of these polyarylether with poly arylene sulfide or polyesters or polyamides. Most preferred compositions include mixtures of polyarylethersulfone and polyesters, particularly poly ethylene terephthalate mixtures of polyarylethers and polyesters mixtures of polyarylethersulfone and poly arylene sulfide or mixtures of polyarylethers and poly arylene sulfide .The Electrical Device The electrical device of this invention includes chip carriers which are holders for microcircuits with contacts and wire bonding pads used to protect the microcircuit and interconnect it with a printed circuit board printed circuit boards as an extruded injection moldable, or laminated support for additive or substractively produced circuit elements and components electrical connectors which are assemblies of conducting elements arranged in the insulating material of this invention and used for circuit element interconnection. The chip carrier, printed circuit board and electrical connectors are made by well known methods in the art such as by injection, compression, or transfer molding or by lamination. Representative methods are described in, for example, U.S. Patents 4,147,889 and 3,975,757. The Amorxhous Polymers A. Polvarvlethersulfones The polyarylethersulfones of this invention are amorphous thermoplastic polymers containing units of the formula EMI5.1 and EMI6.1 and orEMI6.2 wherein R is independently hydrogen, C1 toC6 alkyl or C4 to C8 cycloalkyl, X is independentlyEMI6.3 wherein R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen orC1 to C9 alkyl,EMI6.4 wherein R3 and R4 are independently hydrogen orC1 to C8 alkyl, and B1 is an integer of 3 to 8 S , O , orEMI6.5 a is an integer of O to 4 and n is independently an integer of 1 to 3 and wherein the ratio of unit I to the sum of units II andlor III is greater than 1.The units are attached to each other by an 0 bond. A preferred polymer of this invention contalns units of the formula EMI7.1 and Another preferred polyarylethersulfone of this invention contains units of the formula EMI7.2 and These units are attached to each other by an 0 bond. The polyarylethersulfone may be random or may have an ordered structure. The polyarylethersulfones of this invention have a reduced viscosity of from about 0.4 to greater than about 2.5, as measured inN methylpyrolidone, or other suitable solvent, at 25 C. The polyarylethersulfones of this invention are prepared by reacting the monomers represented by the following formulae EMI8.1 VII and orEMI8.2 wherein R, a, X and n are as previously defined, and X and Y are independently selected from Cl, Br,F, NO2 or OH and at least 50 percent of the Y s are OH. The ratio of the concentration of OH groups to Cl, Br, F andlor NO2 groups used to form the polyarylethersulfone is from about 0.90 to about 1.10, preferably from about 0.98 to about 1.02. The monomers, represented by formulas IV , V , VI and VII , include the following 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane, 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfide, 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl ether. 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone, 2,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone, 4,4 dichlorodlphenyl sulfone, 4,4 dinitrodiphenyl sulfone, 4 chloro 4 hydroxydiphenyl sulfone, 4,4 biphenol, hydroquinone, and the like. The preferred monomers include hydroquinone, 4,4 biphenol, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 4,4 dichlorodiphenyl sulfone, and 4,41dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone or 4 chloro 4 hydroxydiphenyl sulfone. The polymers are prepared by contacting substantially equimolar amounts of the hydroxy containing compounds depicted in formulas IV to VII suPra and halo and or nitro containing compounds depicted in formula IV and V supra with from about 0.5 to about 1.0 mole of an alkali metal carbonate per mole of hydroxyl group in a solvent mixture comprising a solvent which forms an azeotrope with water in order to maintain the react ion medium at substantially anhydrous conditions during the polymerization. The temperature of the reaction mixture is kept at from about 120 to about 180 C, for about 1 to about 5 hours and then raised and kept at from about 200 to about 2500C, preferably from about 210 to about 2300C, for about 1 to 10 hours. The reaction is carried out in an inert atmosphere, e.g., nitrogen, at atmospheric pressure, although higher or lower pressures may also be used. The polyarylethersulfone is then recovered by conventional techniques such as coagulation, solvent evaporation, and the like, The solvent mixture comprises a solvent which forms an azeotrope with water and a polar aprotic solvent. The solvent which forms an azeotrope with water includes an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, chlorobenzene, andthe like. The polar aprotic solvents employed in this invention are those generally known in the art for the manufacture of polyarylether sulfones and include sulfur containing solvents such as those of the formula R S O b R3 in which each R5 represents a monovalent lower hydrocarbon group free of aliphatic unsaturation, which preferably contains less than about 8 carbon atoms or when connected together represents a divalent alkylene group with b being an integer from 1 to 2 inclusive. Thus, in all of these solvents all oxygens and two carbon atoms are bonded to the sulfur atom.Contemplated for use in this invention are such solvents as those having the formula EMI10.1 where the R6 groups are independently lower alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and like groups and aryl groups such as phenyl and alkylphenyl groups such as the tolyl group, as well as those where the R6 groups are interconnected as in B divalent alkylene bridge such as EMI11.1 in tetrahydrothiophene oxides and dioxides.Specifically, these solvents include dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylsulfone, diphenylsulfone, diethylsulfoxide, diethylsulfone, diisopropylsulfone, tetrahydrothiophene l,l dioxide commonly called tetramethylene sulfone or sulfolane and tetrahydrothiophene l monoxide. Additionally, nitrogen containing solvents may be used. These include dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl formamide and N methylpyrolidone. The azeotrope forming solvent and polar aprotic solvent are used in a weight ratio of from about 10 1 to about 1 1, preferably from about 7 1 to about 5 1. In the reaction, the hydroxy containing compound is slowly converted, in situ, to the alkali salt thereof by reacting with the alkali metal carbonate. The alkali metal carbonate is preferably potassium carbonate. Mixtures of carbonates such as potassium and sodium carbonate may also be used. Water is continuously removed from the reaction mass as an azeotrope with the azeotrope forming solvent so that substantially snhydrous conditions are maintained during the polymerization. It is essential that the reaction medium be maintained substantially anhydrous during the polycondensation. While amounts of water up to tout one percent can be tolerated, and are somewhat beneficial when employed with fluorinated dthalobenienoid compounds, amounts of water substantially greater than this are desirably avoided as the reaction of water with the halo andlor nitro compound leads to formation of phenolic species and only low molecular weight products are secured. Consequently, in order to secure the high polymers, the system should be substantially anhydrous, and preferably contain less than 0.5 percent by weight water during the reaction. Preferably, after the desired molecular weight has been attained, the polymer is treated with an activated aromatic halide or an aliphatic halide such as methyl chloride or benzyl chloride, and the like. Such treatment of the polymer converts the terminal hydroxyl groups into ether groups which stabilize the polymer. The polymer so treated has good melt and oxidative stability. B. Polvarylether resin The poly aryl ether resin suitable for blending with the polyarylethersulfone, is different from the polyarylethersulfone and is a linear, thermoplastic polyarylene polyether containing recurring units of the following formula O E O E wherein E is the residuum of a dihydric phenol, andE is the residuum of a benzenoid compound having an inert electron withdrawing group in at least one of the positions ortho and para to the valence bonds both of said residua are velently bonded to the ether oxygens through aromatic carbon atoms. Such aromatic polyethers are included within the class of polyarylene polyester resins described in, for example U.S.Patents 3,264,536 and 4,175,175. It is preferred that the dihydric phenol be a weakly acidic dinuclear phenol such as, for example, the dihydroxyl diphenyl alkanes or the nuclear halogenated derivatives thereof, such as, for example the 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, l,l bis 4 hydroxphenyl 2 phenyl ethane, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane, or their chlorinated derivatives containing one or two chlorines on each aromatic ring. Other materials also termed appropriately bisphenols are also highly valuable and preferred.These materials are the bisphenols of a symmetrical or unsymmetrical joining group, as, for example ether oxygen 0 , carbonylEMI13.1 sulfoneEMI13.2 or hydrocarbon residue in which the two phenolic nuclei are joined to the same or different carbon atoms of the residue. Such dinuclear phenols can be characterized as having the structure EMI14.1 wherein Ar is an aromatic group and preferably is a phenylene group, R7 and R 7 can be the same or different inert substituent groups such as alkyl groups having from 1 to 4 carbons atoms, aryl, halogen atoms, i.e., fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, or alkoxyl radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, the c s are independently integers having a value of from 0 to 4, inclusive, and R8 is representative of a bond between aromatic carbon atoms as in dihydroxyl diphenyl, or is a divalent radical, including for example, radicals such asEMI14.2 0 , S , SO , S S , SO2, and divalent hydrocarbon radicals such as alkylene, alkylidene, cycloalkylene, cycloalkylidene, or the halogen, alkyl, aryl or like substituted alkylene, alkylidene and cycloaliphatic radicals as well as aromatic radicals and rings fused to both Ar groups. Examples of specific dihydric polynuclear phenols including among others the bis hydroxyphenyl alkanes such as 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2,4 dthydroxydiphenylmethane, bis 2 hydroxyphenyl methane, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane, bis 4 hydroxy 2,6 dimethyl 3 methoxyphenyl methane, 1,1 bis 4 hydroxy phenyl ethane, 1,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane, 1,l bis 4 hydroxy 2 chlorophenyl ethane, 1,1 bis 3 methyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 1,3 bis 3 methyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2, 2 bis 3 phenyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 3 isopropyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2, 2 bis 2 isopropyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxy naphthyl propane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane, 3,3 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl heptane, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl phenylmethane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl l phenyl propane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1,1,1,3,3,3, hexafluoropropane, and the like di hydroxyphenyl sulfones such as bis 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfone, 2,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone, 5 chloro 2,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone, 5 chloro 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone, and the like di hydroxyphenyl ethers such as bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ether, the 4,3 , 4,2 2,2 2,3 ,dShydroxyphenyl ethers, 4,4 dihydroxyl 2,6 dimethyldiphenyl ether,bis 4 hydroxy 3 isobutylphenyl ether, bis 4 hydroxy 3 isopropylphenyl ether, bis 4 hydroxy 3 chlorophenyl ether, bis 4 hydroxy 3 fluorophenyl ether, bis 4 hydroxy 3 bromophenyl ether, bis 4 hydroxynaphthyl ether, bis 4 hydroxy 3 chloronaphthyl ether, and 4,4 dlhydroxyl 3,6 dimethoxydiphenyl ether. As herein used the E term defined as being the residuum of the dihydric phenol of course refers to the residue of the dihydric phenol after the removal of the two aromatic hydroxyl groups.Thus as is readily seen these polyarylene polyethers contain recurring groups of the residuum of the dihydric phenol and the residuum of the benzenoid compound bonded through aromatic ether oxygen atom. Any dihalobenzenoid or dinitrobenzenoid compound or mixtures thereof can be employed in this invention which compound or compounds has the two halogens or nitro groups bonded to benzene rings having an electron withdrawing group in at least one of the positions ortho and para to the halogen or nitro group. The dihalobenzenoid or dinitrobenzenoid compound can be either mononuclear where the halogens or nitro groups are attached to the same benzenoid rings or polynuclear where they are attached to different benzenoid rings, as long as there is an activating electron withdrawing group in the ortho or para position of that benzenoid nuclear. Fluorine and chlorine substituted benzenoid reactants are preferred the fluorine compounds for fast reactivity and the chlorine compounds for their inexpensiveness.Fluorine substituted benzenoid compounds are most preferred, particularly when there is a trace of water present in the polymerization reaction system. However, this water content should be maintained below about 1X and preferably below 0.55 for best results. An electron withdrawing group can be employed as the activator group in these compounds.It should be, of course, inert under the reaction conditions, but otherwise its structure is not critical. Preferred are the strong activating groups such a8 the sulfone groupEMI17.1 bonding two halogen or nitro substituted benzenoid nuclei as in the 4,4 dichlorodiphenyl sulfone and 4,4 difluorodiphenyl sulfone, although such other strong withdrawing groups hereinafter mentioned can also be used with equal ease. The more powerful of the electron withdrawing groups give the fastest reactions and hence are preferred. It is further preferred that the ring contain no electron supplying groups on the same benzenoid nucleus as the halogen or nitro group however, the presence of other groups on the nucleus or in the residuum of the compound can be tolerated. The activating group can be basically either of two types a monovalent groups that activate one or more halogens or nitro groups on the same ring such as another nitro or halo group, phenylsulfone, or alkylsulfone, cyano, trifluoromethyl, nitroso, and hetero nitrogen, ss in pyridlne. b divalent groups which can activate displacement of halogens on two different rings, such as the sulfone groupEMI18.1 the carbonyl groupEMI18.2 the vinylene groupEMI18.3 the sulfoxide groupEMI18.4 the azo group N N the saturated fluorocarbon groupsEMI18.5 CF2 CF2CF2 organic phosphine oxidesEMI18.6 where R9 is a hydrocarbon group, and the ethylidene groupEMI18.7 where A can be hydrogen or halogen. If desired, the polymers may be made with mixtures of two or more dihalobenzenoid or dinitrobenzenoid compounds. Thus, the E residuum of the benzenoid compounds in the polymer structure may be the same or different. It is seen also that as used herein, the E term defined as being the residuum of the benzenoid compound refers to the aromatic or benzenoid residue of the compound after the removal of the halogen atom or nitro group on the benzenoid nucleus. The polyarylene polyethers of this invention are prepared by methods well known in the art as for instance the substantially equimolar one step reaction of a double alkali metal salt of dihydric phenol with a dihalobenzenoid compound in the presence of specific liquid organic sulfoxide or sulfone solvents under substantially anhydrous conditions. Catalysts are not necessary for this reaction. The polymers may also be prepared in a two step process in which a dihydric phenol is first converted in situ in the primary reaction solvent to the alkali metal salt of the reaction with the alkali metal, the alkali metal hydride, alkali metal hydroxide, alkali metal alkoxide or the alkali metal alkyl compounds.

Slight molar excesses, e.g., about 0.001 to 0.10 molar excess of either the dinitro substituted organic compound or of the dialkali metal salt of formula XIII may be employed. When the molar ratios are approximately equal, the polymer is substantially terminated by a Z NO2 at one end and a phenolic group at the other end. If there is a molar excess of one compound, that particular terminal group will predominate. The conditions of reaction whereby the alkali metal salt of formula XIII is reacted with the dinitro substituted organic compound of formula XII can be varied widely. Generally, temperatures of the order of about 25 to about 1500C are advantageously employed, although it is possible to employ lower or higher temperature conditions depending on the ingredients used, the reaction product sought, time of reaction, solvent employed, etc. In addition to atmospheric pressure, superatmospheric pressures and subatmospheric pressures may be employed depending upon the other conditions of reaction, the ingredients used, the speed at which it is desired to effect reaction, etc. The time of reaction also can be varied widely depending on the ingredients used, the temperature, the desired yield, etc. It has been found that times varying from about 5 minutes to as much as 30 to 40 hours are advantageously employed to obtain the maximum yield and desired molecular weight.

The tensile specimens were immersed in water at about 250C for 16 hours and then directly immersed in molten solder at 4200F for 60, 90, and 120 seconds to simulate typical VPS exposure conditions. No distortion, bubbling, or foaming was observed. Example 6 Fifty parts by weight of Polyetherimide, 30 parts by weight of the advanced poly phenylene sulfide resin of Example 4 and 20 parts by weight of the fiberglass of Example 5 were blended as described in Example 5 and injection molded and tested as described in the SOLDER TEST. No distortion, bubbling, or foaming of the test specimens was observed. Control C Eighty parts by weight of Polyetherimide and 20 parts by weight of the fiberglass of Example 5 were blended as described in Example 5 and injection molded and tested as described in theSOLDER TEST. The specimens showed foaming. Example 7 Fifty parts by weight of Polyarylate and 50 parts by weight of nylon 6,6 Zytel obtained from E. I. duPont De D Nemours Co. were blended as described in Example 5 and injection molded and tested as described in the SOLDER TEST. No distortion, bubbling, or foaming of the test specimens was observed. Control D Polyarylate was injection molded and tested as described in the SOLDER TEST. The specimens showed distortion.
