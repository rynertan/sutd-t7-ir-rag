# Image processing welding control.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a welding control system and method. The welding control system comprises an infrared camera 17 and a fibre scope 18 which is directed to a welding pool and around the pool. The infrared camera 17 is connected to an image processing device 19 to transfer thereto photographed image information and process the image information to produce control signals which are transfered to a welding control panel 20 . The welding control panel 20 controls electric power for driving a torch driver 21 according to the signals from the image proces sing device 19 and electric power supplied from a welding electric source 21 to the welding torch 13 according to the welding conditions. A welding control method using image processing comprises detection of isothermal pattern of a weld zone in the welding state through photographing the weld zone by the infrared camera 17 calculation of the area of the region defined by the isothermal line detected comparison of the area with a standard area which is obtained in advance control of welding heat input such that the area will be substantially the same as the standard area whereby a suitable welding heat is input the welding portion detection of an asymmetric extent of said isother mal pattern and controlling the torch position such that the asymmetric extent will be within a predetermined value, so that the torch will be strictly aligned with the welding groove center. This method enables two kinds of welding control methods, torch position control and welding heat input control, based on the same image information.
