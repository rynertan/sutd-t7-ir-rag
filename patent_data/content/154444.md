# 6 Aminoacyloxymethyl penicillanic acid 1, 1 dioxides as beta lactamase inhibitors.

## Abstract
beta Lactamase inhibitors which are aminoacid esters of 6 alpha and 6 beta hydroxymethyl pencillanic acid 1,1 dioxides pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof conven tional esters thereof which are hydrolyzable in vivo bis methanediol esters thereof or mixed methanediol esters with said beta lactamase inhibitors and sulbactam. Phar maceutical compositions comprising said beta lactamase inhibitors and a conventional beta lactam antibiotic, said compositions useful in the treatment of bacterial infections. Compounds useful as intermediates in the synthesis of said beta lactamase inhibitors. Antibacterial mixed bis methanediol esters of said aminoacyloxymethyl penicillanic acid 1,1 dioxides and ampicillin or amoxicillin, also useful in the treatment of bacterial infections and intermediates therefor.
