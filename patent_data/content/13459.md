## Description
TOPICAL ANTI ACNE COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to topical compositions comprising benzoyl peroxide and certain topical carriers as well as processes for the topical use of such compositions.More particularly, the invention relates to topical compositions for the treatment Of dCflC and similar skin lesions und methods for treating acne whereby benzoyl peroxide is delivered through skin and other barrier tissue to the underlying focus of infection. Acne and seborrhea are conditions of the human skin characterized by an excessive flow of sebum, or skin oil, from the sebaceous glands located in the pilosebaccous apparatus. Sebum roaches the skin surface through the ducts of the sebaccous follicles. One of the carly events leading to acne lesions is hyperkeratinization. Hyperkeratinization leads to the formation of microcomedones which obstruct the sebaccous follicle. This obstruction leads to the clinical manifestations of acne such as papules, pustules, open comodones, or cysts. The environ ment of the microcomedo is conducive for the growth of bacteria which cause some aspects of the inflammatory response. Acne is particularly characterized by the presence of comedones, inflammatory papules, pustules, or cysts.The effect of acne ranges from slight skin irritation and pitting to disfiguring cars. Many topical therapeutic agents are employed in the treatment of acne and seborrhea to prevent the blocking of tha 1cllicular duct, or, once it has become blocked, to t against the bacteria, and to provide combinations of each of these actions. The horny outer layer of the skin stratum corneum is formed of dead cells composed largely of keratin. Therapeutic agents which act to prevent the blocking of the follicular duct by promoting the removal or sluffing off of excess keratin are known as keratolytic agents. Sulfur, resorcinol and salicylic acid have been used as keratolytic agents in the treatment of acne. For over sixty years, benzoyl peroxide has been used as a keratolytic agent in the topical treatment of skin lesions such as burns, varicose ulcers, sycosis vulgaris, seborrhea, and acne. Benzoyl peroxide, C6H5CO 2O2, is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, crystalline solid, stable at ordinary room temperatures it is a powerful oxidizing agent, yet generally safe for human use. As noted, benzoyl peroxide has been used as a very effective topical keratolytic and antibacterial agent in the treatment of acne.While benzoyl peroxide is an effective topical agent for, the treatment of acne in formulations currently available, there is a continuing search for more effective delivery vehicles It has no been discovered that certain penetrating aids cause benzoyl peroxide to penetrate through keratinized structures such as the stratuin corneum.It is believed that the increased keratolytic and antibacterial benefits of the compositions of the present invention result from the increased pnnetration of benoyl peroxide into the keratinized structures which form the plugs in the sebaceous follicles. When used in the treatment of acne, benzoyl peroxide productes dryness, exfoliation, and a decrease in bacterial flora. The use of benzoyl peroxide in topical compositions for treating skin lesions such as burns, varicose ulcers, sycosis vulgaris, and acne h s bean known for some 60 years. Levine, et al., OhioState Med. J. l65, 492 1969 . Benzoyl peroxide has bren used in various formu lations containing standard cosmetic ingredients. Broad catecjoities of emollients and humectants have becn disclosed for use with benzoyl peroxide. For example,U.S. Patent 4,075,353, nanny, et al., February 21, 1978 describes a process for treating acarid sin infections of animals by topically app.lying benzoyl peroxide.The compositions disclosed include benzoyl peroxide and nonrective carrier materials such as C2 to C20 aliphatic alcohols, glycols including ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, and C12 C22 fatty acids and their esters U.S. Patent 4,052,515, MacDermott, et al., October 4, 1977 claims a method of treating acne by applying a composition containing a C6 C12 unsaturated or saturated alcohol and a C2 C3 monoalcohol propylene glycol is disclosed as a diluent. An additional patent relates to antiacne preparations. U.S. Patent 3,535,422, Cox, et al., October 20, 1970 relates to stable benzoyl peroxide compositions containing organic emollients. The compositions include emollients selected from C4 C20 aliphatic alcohols,C2 C3 glycols, C12 C20 fatty acids and their esters, and mixtures thereof. Although the werkers in the art have made broad disclosures of preparations using benzoyl peroxide, tey do not appear to have realized that the specific ingredients and compositional ranges of use taught herein provide unique, skin penetration enhancing benefits. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention encompasses compositions for use in the topical treatment of acne and similar skin lesions comprising from about 0.5 to about 25 benzoyl peroxide and from about 8 to about 99 of a penetrating carrier consisting essentially of a C6 C14 primary alkanol, or mixtures thereof, and a diol selected from 1,2 prooanediol, 1,2 butanediol, 1,3 butanediol, and 2,3 butane iol, or mixtures thereof, the weight ratio of primary alcohol to diol bring in the range from about 5 1 to about i 30 the balance of the composition comprising cosmetically acceptable excipients. The present invention also encompases a method for treating acne and similar skin lesions, comprising applying to the afflicted situs a safe and effective amount of a composition comprising a from about 0.5 to about 25 by weight of benzoyl peroxide h from about 1 to about 40 of a C6 C14 primary alkanol, or mixtures thereof c from about 5 to about 85 by weight of a diol selected from 1,2 propanediol, 1,2 butanediol, 1,3 butanediol, and 2,3 butanediol, or mixtures thereof and the balance water and optional excipients. It has now been discovered that benzoyl peroxide formulations containing the ingredients described art increase the penetration of benzoyl peroxide across t stratum corneum, and, it is believed, into the follicul keratious tissue especially comedones that leads to cli nically observable acne. The increased penetration results in increased keraholytic and antibacterial benefits, and provides more effective control of the symptoms of acne. Benzoyl peroxide is an item of commerce. The compositions of the present invention comprise from about 0.5 to about 25 benzoyl peroxide preferably from about 1 to about 15, t and most preferably from about 2 to about 10 benzoyl peroxide. By penetrating carrier as used herein is meant the kin penetration promoting mixture of primary alcohol and diol used with benzoyl peroxide. The topical penetrating carrier is typically in the from of cream, gel, or lotion. The topical carrier consists essentially of two critical ingredients, a C6 to C14 primary alcohol and a diol in a weight ratio of from about 5 1 to about 1 30, preferably from about 1 1 to about 1 15 and most preferably from about 1 2 to about 1 10. The anti acne compositions herein typically contain from about 1 to about 40 of the C6 to C14 primary alcohol, or mixtures thereof. Exemplary n alcohols are hexanol octanol, noiianol and decanol lauryl or myristyl alcohol are preferred, and myristyl alcohol is most preferred. TheC6 to C14 primary alcohol is preferably present in the composition at from about 1 to about 10 by weight, and is most preferably present at about 2 to about 5 by weight. The anti acne compositions herein also typically contain from about 5 to about 85 by weight of a diol selected fro 1,2 propanediol, 1,2 butanediol, 1,3 butanediol, 2,3 butanediol, or mixtures thereof 1,2 propanediol is preferred. Ethylene glycol and 1,3 propanediol do not aid the skin penetration of benzoyl peroxide. The diol component is preferably present at from about 7 to about 35 by weight, and most preferably from about 9 to about 15 by weight. The compositions typically comprise cosmetic excipients suc as water and azater ethanol mixtures.Additionally, chelating agents such as EDTA, nitrilotriacetate, and gluconic, citric, and tartaric acids, preferably at a level of from 0.01 to 1 of the composition, can be uscd to avoid the deoomposition of the peroxide compound by metal ions. Other optional components such as finely divided sulfur, USP grade, at a level of from 1 to 25t of the composition, thickening agents, such as methyl cellulose, crows linked carboxyl polymethylene polymers, bentonite, a level of from 1 to 10 of the compositionn, and trace amount of fragrance materials such as perfumes can also be used. Cosmetic resins and film formers can be also be present By the term corprising herein is meant that vdrious other, compatible ingredients can be present in the compositions as long as Thenzoyl peroxide and the critical components of the topical carrier, n alcohol and diol, are present. The term comprising thus encompasses the more restrictive terms consisting essentially of and consisting of . All percentages herein are weight weight. The compositions are typically prepared by thoroughtly blending all of the components together in admix ture, and milling, if necessary, to reduce all particles of benzoyl peroxide to impalpable size typically loss than 0.25 mm . The benzoyl peroxide should be of high purity, on the order of 97 to 100 pure, and in the form of a finely divided powder. The powder may be either wet or dry, but is preferably wet for ease of handling and safety.If wet benzoyl peroxide is used, it may be necessary to grind the crystals before admixture or to mill the composition after admixture and blending to reduce the crystals to impalpable size. Preferably, the milling or grinding operation is performed in the cold to prevent decomposition of the peroxide by localized friction. The compositions are typically applied twice daily to acne lesions. A typical safe and effective usage rate is about 0.001 cm2 skin to about 0.5 g cm2 skin, per application, but this can vary with the user, the severity of the affliction, and the concentration of benzoyl peroxide compound as well as the composition of the topical carrier in the particular composition being used. The examples herein illustrate the present. methods and compositions, but are not intended to be limitations thereof The following compositions illustrates the present invention with the most desired components and formulati Compound by Weight Benzoyl Peroxide 10 Myristyl Alcohol 2 1,2 propanediol 10 Carbopol 940 1.35 Carboset 514H 0.63 NaOH 0.35 Ethanol 13.5 Water Balance 4.0 grams of B. P. Goodrich Carbopol 940 are dispersed in 200 ml H2O. To this solution is added 30 of ethanol. To this mixture is added about 6 pallets 0.6 g. of sodium hydroxide. The mixture immediately gels. To a standard, commercially available solution ofB.F.Goodrich Carboset 514H 30 active polymer in ar water is added sufficient water to produce a solution containing 5 by weight of the active polymer. 50 ml of this dilute solution is added to the previously prepared gel and the mixture is stirred until a uniform gel obtained. To the gel so produced, the other components of the composition are mixed to achieve the desired concentration. Complete mixing of the components is followed by cold milling using a colloid mill to reduce thc particle size of the benzoyl peroxide. The final composition is effective yet reasonably mild to the skin. The composition thus prepared is then applied as needed to the silus of affliction. Typically, the composition is applied morning and night with fingertips, pads, cotton balls, or the like. Although 1,2 propandiol is the preferred diol for formulation purposes, 1,2 butanediol 1,3 butanediol, and 2,3 butanediol can also be used in the present compo sitions to yield enharced penetration of benzoyl peroxide into keratinous tissue. The following examples are typical of the compositions herein. In the rain, the topical application of the compositions of this invention provides excellent anti acne results cver a period of a fe days or weeks.
