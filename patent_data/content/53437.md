# Pump and actuator mechanism.

## Abstract
A pump is described in which a flexible enclosure 11 defines a pump chamber 13 and in which the contents of the pump chamber 13 are expelled by movement of a pair of opposed pusher elements 15, 17 engaged with the enclosure 11 . The pusher elements 15, 17 are displaced by at least one pair of beam springs 27, 33 , each of which is pivotally 57, 59 sup ported at one end and is engaged with one of the pusher elements 15, 17 at the other end. The ends of the beam springs 27, 33 remote from the pusher elements are pivoted by actuation of symmetrical solenoid arma tures 63, 65 , causing each of the springs 27, 33 to be stressend. Relief of the spring stress forces the pusher 15, 17 elements towards each other. De energi zation of the solenoid armatures 63, 65 permits the beam springs to pivot back to the original position upon filing of the pump chamber 13 .
