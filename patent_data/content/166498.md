# Double heterostructure light emitting semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A double heterostructure light emitting semiconductor de vice including a p GaAs substrate having a first electrode 27 formed on one surface and a current confining layer 22 on the other surface. A confined current conduction layer 29 is formed in the current confining layer 22 and a light emitting layer structure 30 is formed on these layers. A capping layer 26 of GaAs having a second electrode 28 is formed on the light emitting layer structure. A light exit window layer 31 for exciting the emitted light is constructed by a thin film of the capping layer.
