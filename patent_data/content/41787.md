## Description
FBC Limited Herbicidal Mixtures This invention relates to herbicidal compositions and to a method of selectively controlling weeds in crops. Benazolin is the common name for a herbicide having the chemical name 4 chloro 2 oxobenzothiazolin 3 ylacetic acid. In this specification this name is used to mean benazolin as the free acid or one of its salt e.g.potassium salt or ester e.g. ethyl ester derivatives acceptable in herbicidal applications. It has now been found according to the invention, that under certain circumstances synergism is exhibited when benazolin is mixed with a 3,5 dihalo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile. The invention comprises a herbicidal composition comprising benazolin in admixture with a 3,5 dihalo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile. In this specification the term 3,5 dihalo 4 hydroxy benzonitrile means 315 dibromo or 3,5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzo nitrile, salts or ester derivatives acceptable in herbicidal applications, particularly the sodium or potassium salts or the n octanoate ester. The free phenols are known by the common names bromoxynil and ioxynil respectively. The invention is generally applicable in controlling weeds in the presence of growing crops such as cereals e.g.wheat and barley. Examples of weeds that may be controlled include mayweeds such as Matricara recu tita, chickweed Stellaria media , knotgrass Polygonum aviculare and speedwells Veronica spp. The weight ratio of benazolin to the 3,5 dihalo 4hydroxybenzonitrile in the mixture of the invention is preferably within the range of from 10 1 to 1 15, more preferably 5 1 to 1 12. As examples of the quantities that are most suitable, the rate of application of benazolin can be from 25 to 500 e.g. 25 250 g. hectare. The rate of application of the 3,5 dihalo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile is preferably from 50 1000, e.g. 100 350 g. hectare. If desired the compositions may include other suitable herbicidese.g. to broaden the spectrum, and especially phenoxyalkanoic acid herbicides and preferably phenoxypropionic acids such as dichlorprop or mecoprop.Such ingredients may be present as the free acid or a suitable salt or ester derivative and are preferably used at a rate of application of osteo 2, e.g. l 1.5,kg. hectare. In this specification ratios and quantities of active ingredients are based on the weight of the free acid, in the case of acids or derivatives thereof or the free phenols in the case of the 3,5 dihalo 4 hydroxybenzonitriles. The mixture of active herbicides can be applied by, for example a spray treatment in any form known in the art for the formulation of herbicidal compounds and preferably as a dispersion, an aqueous emulsion or an aqueous concentrate. As a dispersion, the mixture comprises the active components dispersed in a liquid medium, preferably water.The primary composition for a dispersion can be provided in a number of forms. For example it can be a dispersible solution which comprises the active components dissolved in a water miscible solvent with the addition of a dispersing agent or it can be a dispersible powder comprising the active components and a dispersing agent. A further alternative comprises the active components in the form of a finely ground powder in association with a dispersing agent and intimately mixed with water to give a paste or cream which can if desired be added to an emulsion of oil in water to give a dispersion of active components in an aqueous oil emulsion. An emulsion comprises the active components dissolved in a water immiscible solvent which is formed into an emulsion with water in the presence of an emulsifying agent.An emulsion of the desired concentration can be formed from a primary composition of following types a concentrated stock emulsion comprising the active components in combination with an emulsifying agent, water and waterimmiscible solvent, or an emulsifiable concentrate comprising a solution of the active components in a water immiscible solvent containing an emulsifying agent. The preferred formulation is an aqueous concentrate of the components in a water soluble form dissolved in water and also containing a surfactant. The above herbicidal formulations are to be regarded as part of the invention. The total concentration of the active components in a composition for direct application to the crop by conventional ground methods is preferably within the range of 0.02 to 10 per cent by weight, especially 0.05 to 1 per cent by weight, of the composition, but more concentrated compositions containing, for example up to 20 per cent may be desirable. In a primary composition the total amount of active compound can vary widely, for example, from 5 to 95 per cent by weight. The invention is illustrated in the following ExampleExampleA A field of barley infested with various weeds was divided into replicate areas and sprayed at various application rates with aqueous emulsions or solutions of active ingredients alone and in admixture. The herbicidal effects three weeks after spraying was assessed visually using a scoring system from 0 to 10 in which 0 is no control and 10 is complete control. With certain weeds and mix tures, synergism was exhibited as shown in the following tables scores are the average of two replicates unless marked with an asterisk in which case only one plot was treated with that particular dose . The weight of active ingredient is based on the weight of free acid in the case of benazolin or free phenol in the cases of the 3,5 dihalo 4hydroxybenzonitrile.Speedwell Veronica spp. Benazolin Ethyl Ester Ioxynil octanoate ester Mixture Control g1ha Control g ha Control Expected Observed 75 0 100 3.5 3.5 8 50 1.5 1.5 4.5 150 0 100 3.5 3.5 9.5 50 1.5 1.5 4.5Benazolin K salt Bromoxynil K salt Mixture Control g. ha Control g. ha Control Expected Observed 75 0 300 3 3 6 150 1.5 1.5 3Mayweed Matricaria recutita Benazolin K salt Bromoxynil K salt Mixture Control Control g ha Control Expected Observed 75 0.5 75 2 2.5 6.75 37.5 0.5 1.0 5 In a similar manner experiments were carried out with fields of wheat.
