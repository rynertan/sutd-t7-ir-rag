# Document inserter systems.

## Abstract
A document inserter has an improved control arrange ment. The document inserter has a system for orderly shut down and re start. The system comprises a first web module for receiving the first web, scanning the sprocket strips of the first web for control information, removing the sprocket strips, storing and retransmitting the control information, separating the web into discrete forms, forming accumulations of the dis crete forms, and feeding said accumulations for further pro cessing by the system. The system further includes a second web module for receiving a second web, separating the second web into discrete forms, forming second accumulations of the second discrete forms, and feeding the second accumulations synchronously with the first accumulations for further pro cessing by the system. The system is controlled by a supervi sory control system which includes a non volatile memory, which supervisory control system receives the retransmitted control information and controls the operation of the system. The supervisory control system is further responsive to a shut down signal to complete operations in accordance with control information from control forms which have been separated from the first web, receive from the first web module the con trol information associated with unseparated control forms from which the sprocket strips have been removed, store this information in the non volatile memory, and halt operation of the system. The supervisory control system is further respon sive to a restart signal to read the stored information from the non volatile memory and restart operations in accordance with the stored information to complete processing of the control documents from which the control information has been re moved.
