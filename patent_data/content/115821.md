## Description
FLUORAN COMPOUNDS The present invention relates to novel fluoran compounds. More particularly, the present invention relates to 2 chloro substituted benzylamino 6dibutylamino fluoran compounds useful as a coloring material for heat or pressure sensitive record sheets. As a typical conventional fluoran compound, A 1 2 benzylamino 6 diethylamino fluoran represented by the formula EMI1.1 is well known Japanese Examined Patent Publication No.4614 1971 , which undergoes color development when brought in contact with an acidic substance. Also known are A 2 2 2 chlorobenzylamino 6 diethylamino fluoran represented by the formula EMI1.2 and A 3 2 4 chlorobenzylamino 6 diethylamino fluoran represented by the formula EMI2.1 U.S. Patent No. 3,825,561 . The present inventors have found that novel fluoran compounds which are similar to the conventional fluoran compounds but have an N,N dibutylamino group at the 6 position instead of the N,N diethylamino group and a chloro substituted benzylamino group at the 2 position, have superior properties as a coloring material for heat or pressure sensitive record sheets. Namely, the present invention provides 2 chloro substitutedbenzylamino 6 dibutylamino fluoran compounds represented by the formula EMI2.2 The fluoran compounds of the formula I are novel compounds, which are substantially colorless solid and which, when brought in contact with an acidic substance, i.e. an electron acceptor such as an organic acid, an acid clay, an activated acid clay, a phenol resin, a metal salt of an aromatic carboxylic acid, or bisphenolA, readily form coloring agents having a deep greenish black color. The coloring agents thus developed, have superior properties useful for a coloring material for heat or pressure sensitive record sheets. As compared with the conventional fluoran compounds, the fluoran compounds of the general formula I are superior in 1 the solubility in an organic solvent, when used for pressure sensitive record sheets, and 2 the rising for color development, 3 the low temperature color development and 4 the resistance to self color development under humidity, when used for heat sensitive record sheets. Thus, they are extremely useful for a color developing record material. Now, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the preferred embodiments. The fluoran compounds of the formula I include the following specific compounds B 2 2 chlorobenzylamino 5 di n butylamino fluoran of the formula EMI3.1 C 2 t3 chlorobenzylamino 6 di n butylamino fluoran of the formula EMI4.1 D 2 4 chlorobenzylamino 6 di n butylamino fluoran of the formula EMI4.2 The solubility of the fluoran compounds B , C and D of the present invention in organic solvents was compared with that of the above mentioned conventional fluoran compounds A 1 , A 2 and A 3 , and the results are shown in Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, the fluoran compounds B , C and D of the present invention are superior to the conventional fluoran compounds A l , A 2 and A 3 in the solubility in the organic solvents and thus have good oil compatibility which is essential for a color developing material. The present inventors have conducted extensive researches for fluoran compounds to be used for heat sensitive record sheets which have no substantial self color development, a high developed color density, a low color development initiation temperature, a high rising for color development and excellent resistance to self color development under humidity, and have found that the fluoran compounds of the formula I have excellent properties to satisfy the above requirements. The fluoran compounds of the formula I of the present invention may be prepared by the following method 1 or 2 . 1 A benzylamine compound represented by the general formula EMI6.1 where R is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group, and 2 2 hydroxy 4 diDutylamino benzoyl benzoic acid of the formula EMI7.1 are reacted at a temperature of from 0 to 80 C for from a few hours to some 10 hours in the presence of a condensing agent such as concentrated sulfuric acid.After the reaction, the reaction mixture is poured into water, and an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is added to bring the pH to from 8 to 10. The precipitate thereby formed, is collected by filtration. To the cake, toluene and an aqueous solution containing from 5 to 10 by weight of sodium hydroxide are added, and the mixture is stirred for 1 to 3 hours under reflux. The toluene layer is separated by liquid phase separation, washed with water and concentrated. The precipitated crystals are collected by filtration. By the filtration of the crystals, a 2 chloro substituted benzylamino 6 dibutylamino fluoran compound of the formula I is obtainable in high purity and good yield. If necessary, the product is recrystallized from an organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, toluene or acetone. 2 2 Amino 6 dibutylamino fluoran of the formula EMI7.2 is reacted with a chloro substituted benzylchloride represented by the general formula EMI8.1 in water or in a volatile organic inert solvent in the presence of an acid binding agent such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or sodium hydrogen carbonate, whereby a fluoran compound of the formula I is obtainable. From the practical point of view, the method 1 is preferred. As the condensing agent to be used in the present invention, there may be mentioned concentrated sulfuric acid, acetic acid anhydride, phosphoric acid, polyphosphoric acid, phosphorus oxychloride and zinc chloride. From the practical point of view, it is preferred to use concentrated sulfuric acid.
