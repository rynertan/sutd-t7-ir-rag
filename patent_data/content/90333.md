# Method of making integral molded silicone products with different phases and the molded products prepared therefrom.

## Abstract
Integral silicone molded products comprising a unitary structure of a substrate with different phases is made by coating a substrate with a mixture of an alkenyl containing polyorganosiloxane, a polyorganohydrogensiloxane, and an addition reaction catalyst where at least one component is applied to the substrate and then additional components are applied and diffuse to result in a coating with a poly organosiloxane phase having a low degree of crosslinking and a polyorganosiloxane phase having a high degree of crosslinking and the former phase is next to the substrate. Such molded products can constitute coated hybrid IC tran sistors, solar battery modules, and optical fibers.
