# Apparatus for delivering varying quantities of a fluid.

## Abstract
An apparatus is provided which is adapted to deliver or absorb variable amounts of torque or to deliver variable quan tities of an incompressible fluid at a predetermined pressure. The device comprises a positive displacement pump 38, 42, 44 capable of pumping a compressible fluid and an incom pressible fluid or a mixture of a compressible fluid and an incompressible fluid together with appropriate pressure con trol 94 and flow control mechanisms 114 and interconnect ing duct means 110, 14, 90 , check valve mechanisms being provided when required.
