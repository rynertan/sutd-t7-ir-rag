# Photopolymerisable compositions comprising derivatives of aryl ketones and p dialkylaminoarylaldehydes as sensitisers for visible light.

## Abstract
Photopolymerizable compositions comprising a photopolymerizable monomer, hexaarylbiimidazole as an initiator and a sensitizing amount of a selected compound derived from aryl ketones and p dialkylamino arylaldehydes. The photopolymerizable compositions which optionally contain inert components such as organic polymeric binders, solvents, etc. are photoactivated in the visible region of the spectrum. The photopolymerizable compositions are useful in lithographic and letter press printing plantes, engineering drafting films, lithographic films, photoresists and solder masks.
