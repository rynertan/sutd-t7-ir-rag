# PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE ENZYMES AND THE USE THEREOF

## Abstract
A newly discovered and isolated heat stable NAD P linked secondary alcohol specific dehydrogenase enzyme is derived from microorganisms grown under aerobic condi tions in a culture medium containing a carbon containing compound having at least two carbon atoms, preferably a C₂ C₁₀ alkane or a C₂ C₁₀ alkyl radical donating compound, as the major carbon and energy source. The purified form of this enzyme, in the presence of NAD P , is capable of converting primary and secondary alcohols, diols and aldehydes to their corresponding oxidation products and acetone to propanol. In addition, a newly discovered NAD P linked primary alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme can be isolated from the same microorganism source.
