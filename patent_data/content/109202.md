# Power transmission chain.

## Abstract
A rocker joint 18 for a drive chain or a chain belt comprising a pair of joint members of like cross section and having front surfaces which rock or roll on one another. The joint members each have a fromt surface defined by a first radius 36 and a back surface defined by a second 42 and a third radius 45 both progressively smaller than the first radius. A rocker joint pair of members fits into each group of aligned apertures in the inter leaved sets of links to join the links and permit articulation of the chain. The link apertures are generally round and have a surface substantially engaged by a back surface of a pivot member.
