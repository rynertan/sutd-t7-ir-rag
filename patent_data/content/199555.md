## Description
This invention relates to molybdenum or tungsten sulphide containing catalysts. In particular this inventin relates to a process for the preparation of promoted molybdenum or tungsten sulfide catalysts, the catalysts prepared by such process and their predecessors and to the use of such catalysts for hydroprocessing, particularly hydrotreating. More particularly, this invention relates to the preparation and use of promoted catalysts useful for hydroprocessing processes such as hydrotreating wherein said catalysts are formed by treating molybdenum sulfide or tungsten sulfide containing materials which may be supported with an organometallic complex containing a transition metal promoter. The most preferred transition metals are selected from Co, Fe and Ni. The petroleum industry is increasingly turning to coal, tar sands, heavy crudes and distilled residual oils as sources for feedstocks. Feedstocks derived from these heavy materials often contain more sulfur and nitrogen than feedstocks derived from more conventional crude oils and are commonly referred to as being dirty feeds. These feeds require a considerable amount of upgrading before being introduced into processes which make lighter products such as fuel oil or gasoline. Such upgrading or refining generally is accomplished by the hydrotreating processes which are well known in the petroleum industry. Hydrotreating processes may require the step of treating the hydrocarbon with hydrogen or a catalytic material to convert at least a portion of the feedstocks to lower molecular weight hydrocarbons, or to remove unwanted components, or compounds, or to convert them into innocuous or less undesirable compounds. Hydrotreating may be applied to a variety of feedstocks, e.g., solvents, light, middle, or heavy distillate feeds and residual feeds, or fuels. In hydrorefining relatively light feeds, the feeds are treated with hydrogen, often to improve odor, color, stability, combustion characteristics, and the like. Unsaturated hydrocarbons are often hydrogenated to saturation. Sulfur and nitrogen are occasionally removed as part of such treatments. In the treatment of catalytic cracking feedstocks, the cracking quality of the feedstock is generally improved by the hydrotreating in that elemental carbon yield is reduced and gasoline yield is increased. In the hydrodesulfurization HDS of heavier feedstocks, or residua, the sulfur compounds are hydrogenated and cracked. Carbon sulfur bonds are broken, and the sulfur, for the most part, is converted to hydrogen sulfide which is removed as a gas from the process. Hydrodenitrogenation HDN , to some degree, also accompanies hydrodesulfurization reactions. In the hydrodesulfurization of relatively heavy feedstocks, emphasis is on the removal of sulfur from the feedstock. Catalysts most commonly used for hydrotreating reactions include materials such as cobalt molybdate on alumina, nickel on alumina, cobalt molybdate promoted with nickel, nickel tungstate, etc. Molybdenum sulfide is also used to upgrade oils containing sulfur and nitrogen compounds by catalytically removing such compounds in the presence of hydrogen, which processes are collectively known as hydrotreating or hydrorefining processes, it being understood that hydrorefining also includes some hydrogenation of aromatic and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons. Thus, U.S. Patent No. US A 2,914,462 discloses the use of molybdenum sulfide for hydrodesulfurizing gas oil and U.S. A 3,148,135 discloses the use of molybdenum sulfide for hydrorefining sulfur and nitrogen containing hydrocarbon oils. U.S. A 2,715,603 discloses the use of molybdenum sulfide as a catalyst for the hydrogenation of heavy oils, while U.S. A 3,074,783 discloses the use of molybdenum sulfides for producing sulfur free hydrogen and carbon dioxide, wherein the molybdenum sulfide converts carbonyl sulfide to hydrogen sulfide. Molybdenum sulfide has other uses in catalysis, including hydrogenation, methanation, water gas shift, etc., reactions. Catalysts comprising molybdenum sulfide in combination with other metal sulfides are also known.

Additionally, Gleim Gatsis s U.S. Patent No. US A 3,262,874, suggests a variation of the above noted processes in which the catalyst is the decomposition product of a mixture of a heteropoly acid and nickelous sulfate.

The use of nickel to promote various sulfide catalysts has been reported. None of the above cited prior art discloses a molybdenum or tungsten sulfide catalyst suitable for hydroprocessing in which the molybdenum or tungsten sulfide is promoted by use of low valent transition metal compounds. US A 4431747 describes and claims a process for the preparation of supported carbon containing molybdenum sulfide and tungsten sulfide catalyst which comprises The decomposition temperature may range from about 150 C to about 400 C, the salt impregnated catalyst precursor composite may be contacted with hydrogen at a flow rate ranging from about 250 to about 5000 SCF Bbl 0.0445 to 0.89 liter H₂ liter feed , at pressures ranging from about 50 to about 4000 psia, and with a liquid feed hydrocarbon at a flow rate of hydrocarbon catalyst precursor of from about 0.05 to about 50 volumes of hydrocarbon per volume of catalyst per hour, and the added sulfur may be equivalent to a sulfur content which ranges from about 0.1 to about 10 percent, calculated as elemental sulfur based on the weight of the hydrocarbon feed. US A 4431747 also describes the use of the supported carbon containing molybdenum sulfide tungsten sulfide catalysts for hydrotreating petroleum feedstocks. The present invention relates to a method of preparing a hydroprocessing catalyst comprising promoted molybdenum sulfide and or tungsten sulfide components, the method comprising bringing into contact The component 2 may comprise a solution of a soluble complex of a molybdenum sulfide and or a tungsten sulfide. The soluble complex may be a molecular complex of an ammonium and or hydrocarbyl substituted ammonium salt of a molybdenum sulfide and or tungsten sulfide cluster having an anion of general formula Mo The hydrocarbyl substituted ammonium cation s of the said salts may be of formula R¹R²R³R⁴N wherein R¹, R², R³, R⁴ are the same or different positively charged radicals selected from hydrogen i.e., H , C₁ C₁₈ alkyls, C₅ C₁₈ cycloalkyls, C₆ C₁₈ alkyl substituted cycloalkyls, C₆ C₁₈ aromatics, and C₇ C₁₈ alkyl substituted aromatics e.g., the soluble complex sulfide may be selected from tetraalkylammonium thiomolybdates and or thiotungstates, such as tetrabutylammonium thiomolybdates and or tetrabutylammonium thiotungstates . Organometallic materials which operate to promote molybdenum sulfide in hydroprocessing reactions include any low valent transition metal organometallic complex which is capable of reaction with the molybdenum or tungsten sulfides or polysulfides . Examples of the organometallic complex materials include Co₂ CO ₈ Co NO CO ₃ cobalt cyclopentadienyl dicarbonyl nickel di 4,5 cyclooctadiene Ni CO ₄ C₂H₅O ₃P ₄Ni C₄H₆Fe CO ₃ and Fe₂ CO ₉. Hydroprocessing process is meant to include any process that is carried out in the presence of hydrogen including, but not limited to, hydrocracking, hydrodesulfurization, hydrogenation of aromatic and aliphatic unsaturated hydrocarbons, methanation, water gas shift, etc. The present catalyst is especially suitable as a hydrodesulfurization catalyst. These reactions include hydrotreating and hydrorefining reactions, the difference generally being thought of as more of a difference in degree than in kind, with hydrotreating conditions being more severe than hydrorefining conditions. As noted above, this invention deals with bulk or supported molybdenum or tungsten sulfide hydroprocessing catalysts which have been promoted with low valent, transition metal organometallic complexes. The molybdenum sulfide containing or tungsten sulfide containing material which is treated with the low valence transition metal containing organometallic complex may be a solid bulk material having the general formulae of MoS The molybdenum or tungsten sulfide containing material may also be a soluble molecular complex wherein an ammonium and or a hydrocarbyl substituted ammonium salt of a molybdenum or tungsten sulfide cluster having an anion of the general formulae Mo The cations of the Mo Generally preferred soluble MoS Mixtures of the molybdenum and tungsten sulfide starting materials whether they be bulk or soluble are also contemplated as are one or the other or both as a suitable substrate of the type readily known in this art. The low valent organometallic complexes may be based on any reactive transition metal. The preferred metals are Fe, Ni or Co and the most preferred is Co. By low valent is meant that the metal is in the 0 or 1 valence state. The complex may be monometallic or may contain two or more of the cited transition metals. Although carbonyl complexes are desirable because they are readily available and reactive, other complexes are similarly suitable, e.g., Co NO CO ₃, cobalt cyclopentadienyl dicarbonyl, nickel di 1,5 cyclooctadiene , Ni CO ₄, C₂H₅O ₃P ₄Ni, C₄H₆Fe CO ₃ and Fe₂ CO ₉. For the purposes of discussing this invention, the material produced by the reaction of the molybdenum or tungsten sulfide with the low valent organometallic complex will be called the predecessor or predecessor catalyst . The predecessor catalyst may be introduced directly into the reaction vessel without additional treatment and brought up to operation on oil . The predecessor catalyst, as present in the reactor after having been brought up on oil will be referred to as the catalyst . The predecessor catalyst may be treated with hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide either prior to its introduction into the reaction vessel or in situ within the reaction vessel. The predecessor material so treated will be referred to as the sulfided catalyst . Each of the predecessor catalyst , sulfided catalyst and catalyst form variations of the present invention. There are three general methods for producing the catalytic materials of this invention 1 impregnation of the low valent transition metal organometallic complex into a catalyst support containing molybdenum and or tungsten sulfides 2 direct addition of the organometallic complex to bulk molybdenum and tungsten sulfides and 3 direct addition of the organometallic complex to a soluble molybdenum and or tungsten sulfide complex. The first process involves the treatment of a catalyst support containing molybdenum or and tungsten sulfide with the noted complexes. Production of supported molybdenum tungsten sulfide is taught generally in U.S. Patents US A 4,431,747 and US A 4,430,443 to Siever and Chianelli. The preferred support for the catalyst species of this invention is alumina, and the composite support can contain for example, one or more of alumina, bentonite, clay, diatomaceous earth, zeolite, silica, activated carbon, magnesia, zirconia, boria, titania and the like, these latter with alumina, usually in a range of from about 1 to 20 weight percent, based on the weight of the support. A preferred support for the practice of the present invention is one having a surface area of more than 50 m² g, preferably from about 100 to about 300 m² g. A solution of the organometallic complex is simply contacted with the supported molybdenum or tungsten sulfide, preferably at or near room temperature, although gentle heating may occasionally be desirable until the reaction is complete. When using a carbonyl complex, for instance, the reaction is substantially done when the evolution of gaseous CO ceases. Similarly, when promoting the bulk form of the molybdenum or tungsten sulfide, the organometallic complex solution is simply mixed with the base molybdenum tungsten sulfide material for a period of time sufficient to complete the reaction. When promoting a molybdenum or tungsten sulfide substrate which is solubilized as a complex e.g., TBA ₂MoS₄, the organometallic complex is added in an appropriate amount and the product recovered after precipitation. The suitable Mo W complexes include those generally specified above. Calcination is not usually desired lest the hydroconversion activity of the catalyst of the invention be curtailed. As discussed above, molybdenum and tungsten sulfide catalysts both bulk and supported , have many uses, including hydrotreating. Hydrotreating conditions vary considerably depending on the nature of the hydrocarbon being hydrogenated, the nature of the impurities or contaminants to be reacted or removed, and, Finally, the catalysts of this invention are particularly useful for removing sulfur from sulfur containing feedstocks whether or not the feedstock additionally contains other contaminants such as nitrogen. Indeed, these materials are exceptionally selective as HDS catalysts. The invention will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples. A sample of 1.2 g MoS₃ 6.25 mmoles was placed in a 50 ml Schlenk flask in an inert atmosphere chamber, and slurried in 10 ml THF. An amount of 90 mg Co₂ CO ₈ .263 mmoles was dissolved in 5 ml THF and added to the MoS₃ slurry. Slow evolution of gas CO was observed. After 18 hours the solution was colorless, and gas evolution had ceased. The solid was filtered under an inert atmosphere, pressed and sieved to 20 40 U.S. Standard mesh 0.84 0.42 mm . Assuming complete reaction of Co₂ CO ₈, the Co Mo ratio was 0.084. The HDS activity of the bulk product precursor catalyst produced in Example 1 was tested by the following procedure. The catalyst as produced was placed in an autoclave operating at 3150 kPa and 350 Approximate first order rate values are compared, in the Table below, with that of a well known commercial HDS catalyst made up of sulfided CoMo on alumina having an initial composition of 12.5 MoO₃ and 3.5 CoO. It should be noted that in both runs, the activity increases during the run, and the reported pseudo first order rate values must be interpreted accordingly. Nevertheless, it is clear that this inventive catalyst exhibits a very high activity particularly when the low Co Mo ratio 0.1 is taken into account. A catalytic material was prepared according to the following procedure 7.61 g of ammonium pore paramolybdate NH₄ ₆Mo₇O₂₄ in 121 g H₂O was impregnated on 76.8 gm of Al₂O₃ using an incipient wetness method. The impregnate was then calcined at 400 The inventive precursor catalyst produced in Example 3 Catalyst A was then evaluated on a real feed of light catalytic cycle oil LCCO . The test was carried out in an automated, continuously stirred tank reactor unit consisting of a one liter autoclave, calibrated feed burette, pump, gas liquid separator, and product liquid collector. Twenty cc of precursor catalyst 6.32 g was charged in a stainless steel basket which was placed inside the autoclave. The test conditions were 325 As can be seen, the catalyst gives an unusual combination of high HDS and low HDN. This selectivity behavior for HDS can further be quantified by taking the ratio of the HDS reactive rate K Table 3 shows the comparison of HDS selectivity between the two catalysts. The high HDS selectivity of the experimental catalyst suggests that it may be used to advantage if it is used in combination with an HDN selective catalyst in a composite bed or a two stage reactor system. A process of this type would provide greater control over hydrogen utilization and allow each of the two selective catalysts to be individually optimized for different quality feeds.
