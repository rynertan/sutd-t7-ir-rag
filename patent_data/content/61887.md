# A method of producing a resistance element for a resistance thermometer.

## Abstract
A resistance thermometer element having a thin layer of platinum metal on an insulating substrate is formed by magnetron sputtering in a gaseous atmosphere containing at least 10 by volume of oxygen. Any balance gas has less than 10 by volume of krypton and xenon. The atmosphere may have up to 100 oxygen with any balance gas being inert to platinum. Air can be used. A planar magnetron may be used.
