## Description
This invention relates to clinical transplantation and treatment of autoimmune diseases. The invention is directed to the identification of a class of compounds with antiphagocytic and immunomodulating properties which can prevent graft rejection of donor tissue by a recipient. Immunosuppressive agents are currently employed in a wide variety of medical applications including clinical transplantation, treatment of autoimmune diseases and investigations into basic immunological functions. In particular, transplantation of organs represents the major solution to human organ failure but immunosuppression of the recipient is essential for graft survival in mismatched donor recipient combinations. The current understanding of graft rejection suggests that passenger antigen presenting cells of donor type are a prerequisite for the induction of the immune response in the recipient which will eventually lead to the rejection of the animal graft. It has been shown that long term Unfortunately, most of the drugs commonly used for immunosuppression are themselves toxic and must be administered systemically causing impairment of the host s immune system and other deleterious effects. Research has established that a fungal product, cyclosporin, can be employed in clinical transplantation with some success. However, nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, systemic administration leading to patient susceptibility to opportunistic infection, spontaneous lymphomas, and expensive long term therapy are among the major drawbacks when using this product. From this earlier research, it is apparent that there still exists a demand for bettor and less toxic immunomodulating agents. It is well established for review see Taylor, A. 1971. The toxicology of sporidesmins and other epipolythiadioxopiperazines. In Microbial Toxins VII, pp 337 376. Edited by S. Kadis, A. Ciegler and S.J. Ajl. New York Academic Press that a variety of fungi produce epipolythiodioxopiperazines when cultured in a nutrient broth. These compounds have been investigated Thus, J. Med. chem. vol. 17 1974 , pages 827 835 discloses a method of synthesizing gliotoxin tetrasulphide by inserting sulphur atoms in the disulphide linkage of gliotoxin. Although the Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, considered at present the optimal laboratory model for multiple sclerosis. Studies on the pathogenesis of this model disease strongly point to the cellular nature of the immune damage and it is thought that macrophages are important in both afferent and efferent limbs of the immune response leading to the pathological state of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Again, nothing is known concerning the effects of the above mentioned fungal and or synthesized compounds, belonging to the epipolythiodioxopiperazines, on the etiology of this disease. One object of the present invention is to provide a method of treating biological material in order to prevent graft rejection in mismatched donor recipient combinations. By the expression biological material is meant any material which may be involved in transplantation procedures such as, for example, single cells, clumps of cells, complete organs, groups of organs or any combination thereof. We have found that certain of the class of compounds known as epipolythiodioxopiperazines exhibit antiphagocytic and immunomodulating properties. A number of compounds falling within the class of epipolythiodioxopiperazines have been found to be particularly effective in preventing graft rejection, in particular gliotoxin, gliotoxin tri sulfide, gliotoxin tetra sulfide, sporidesmin, 1,4 dimethyl 3,6 epidithio 2,5 dioxopiperazine and dehydrogliotoxin. Accordingly, the present invention provides the use of a compound of the general formula 1 wherein R wherein R⁵, R⁶, R⁷, R⁸ and R⁹ are radicals separately selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, sulfate, and halogen or R² and R³ together represent a radical of the general formula 3 wherein R¹⁰ and R¹¹ both represent hydrogen or together, represent a valence bond R¹², R¹³, R¹⁴, R¹⁵ are radicals selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydroxy, alkoxy, sulfate and acyloxy and n is an integer selected from the range 2 to 4 Alkyl and alkoxy radicals have 1 to 6 carbon atoms, more especially 1 to 4 carbon atoms. An acyloxy radical has 1 to 6, more especially 1 to 4, carbon atoms, in addition to the carbonyl carbon atom, and is, for example, an alkanoyloxy radical. The agent may be used, for example, in the treatment of auto immune diseases. It may also be used in a clinical transplantation procedure in which biological material is treated An advantage of the present invention is that it permits the treatment, not necessarily of the recipient, but rather of the donated biological material, for example an organ, in transplantation procedures. One advantage of treating donated material is that it eliminates the side effects of the currently used immunosuppressive drugs. Specific side effects averted may include toxicity to organs in the recipient, development of opportunistic infections such as pneumonia, expensive long term therapy, etc. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a method of treating transplantable biological material to produce anti phagocytic and immunoregulating properties which comprises incubating the material prior to transplantation, alone or in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents, with a compound of the general formula 1 as defined above or with sporidesmin or 1,4 dimethyl 3,6 epidithio 2,5 dioxopiperazine. It is hypothesised that the treatment of donor material according to the invention may result in the selective inactivation of passenger leucocytes within the donor material which are responsible for initiation of graft rejection within the recipient. Such treatment may, unlike conventional treatments, It is known that the species of the fungi We have now established that these compounds display anti phagocytic activity as tested by macrophage adherence to plastic as well as phagocytosis of particulate matter and, when used to pretreat stimulator spleen cells, inhibit the cells ability to induce alloreactive and major histocompatibility complex restricted cytotoxic T cells. This is the model system for graft rejection. The metabolites see Figure 1 were chloroform soluble and purified separately into three biologically active compounds on thin layer chromatography. These compounds were purified Figure 2 and one of them was confirmed as gliotoxin Figure 1, n 2 . Authentic gliotoxin was found to have similar anti phagocytic and immunomodulating activity as the purifed sample. A method for the isolation of substantially pure gliotoxin from fungal cultures is provided by the following examples It was also found that Thus the present invention also provides gliotoxin trisulfide C₁₃H₁₄N₂O₄S₃ and a pharmaceutical preparation comprising gliotoxin tri sulfide in association with one or mote pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents. The invention further provides gliotoxin tri sulphide for use as a medicament or in a clinical transplantation procedure. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of gliotoxin tri sulfide, which comprises cultivation of a gliotoxin tri sulfide producing strain of fungi in contact with a nutrient medium and isolating gliotoxin tri sulfide therefrom, more particularly cultivation of a gliotoxin tri sulfide producing strain of Similarly gliotoxin tetrasulfide may be prepared by cultivation of a gliotoxin tetra sulfide producing strain of fungi in contact with a nutrient medium and isolating gliotoxin tetra sulfide therefrom, more particularly by cultivation of a gliotoxin tetra sulfide producing strain of By way of example only, methods for isolating substantially pure gliotoxin tri and tetra sulfide from We have discovered that gliotoxin, gliotoxin trisulfide and gliotoxin tetrasulfide and related compounds belonging to the class of epipolythiodioxopiperazines inhibit phagocytosis by macrophages Table 1 , white cells that participate in the host s defense system against infection and co operate with other immune cells in mounting an immune response. One aspect of this defense system, which is shared by all stimulator cells macrophage like white cells , is the presentation of antigen by the cells of one animal to responder lymphocytes another white cell of another animal with the subsequent generation of cytotoxic or killer T cells. This model, that is, Thus, compounds that may be used according to the present invention are a class of compounds, structurally related to gliotoxin and substantially pure, which exhibit similar anti phagocytic and immunomodulating properties to those of gliotoxin, said compounds being selected from those having the general formula 1 and from sporidesmin and 1,4 dimethyl 3,6 epidithio 2,5 dioxopiperazine. One aspect of the use of the present invention is in the manufacture of an agent for use in a method of treating animal tissue or donor animals A further aspect of the present invention is the use of these compounds for the manufacture of an agent for use in a method of preventing the onset of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis by treatment of sensitized donor immune cells prior to implantation into recipient animals. The invention further provides gliotoxin tri sulfide for use in modulating or suppressing the immune response of animals or humans and gliotoxin tri sulfide for use in treating auto immune diseases in animals or humans. Details of the materials and methods as used in the present invention will now be described.

TGM target cells were labelled with ⁵¹Cr Amersham, England for 1 hr, washed thoroughly and added in 0.1 ml aliquots at 2x10⁵ cells ml and incubated at 37 Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy NMR was performed on a JEOL FX90Q spectrometer operating at 89.56 MH The absorbance at 540 nm, indicative of the residual adherent neutral red labelled TGM population, was plotted against the dilution of solutions containing epipolythiodioxopiperazines. Similar plots were constructed as a function of concentration for known or identified substances. The effective dilution of unknown samples is defined as that dilution which results in 50 of the maximum observed loss of adherent TGM the corresponding parameter for purified fractions of known compounds is expressed as the ED₅₀ or effective dose. The amount of biological activity in culture or purified fractions is determined by the following formula where gliotoxin Cells 5 x 10⁶ ml in Eagle s minimal essential medium F15 Grand Island Biological Co., Grand Island, N.Y. supplemented with 5 FCS were preincubated for 30 min at 37 Phagocytosis of carbonyl iron was measured by light microscopy following the method described by Koren H S, and Hodes R F, Uptake of fluorescent microspheres 0.57 um diameter Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA was analyzed by the fluorescent activated cell sorter.

The inhibitory effects of GT upon phagocytosis is generally expressed in terms of the ED₅₀ value which is defined as that concentration of GT which resulted in one half the measured inhibitory effect. Details of the results obtained from the present invention will now be described. The R Electron impact mass spectroscopy of Component A gave M at 262, 244, 226, and 214. No fragments with m e greater than 262 were observed. Chemical ionization of Component B gave M 1 at 327, 263 M 1 S₂ , 245 M 1 S₂ H₂O and 227 M 1 S₂ 2H₂O . Chemical ionization of Component C gave M 1 at 391, 359 M 1 S , 327 M 1 S₂ , 263 M 1 S₄ , 245 M 1 S₄ H₂0 and 227 M 1 S₄ 2H₂0 . The high resolution chemical ionization mass spectra indicated the following The optical rotation of Component C CHCl₃, conc. 2.33 x10 ⁴M was M ₄₀₄ 1890 The chemical properties, stability characteristics, TLC mobility, high resolution NMR, IR and mass spectroscopy combined with comparisons of authentic samples of gliotoxin permit identification of Components A, B, C as gliotoxin, gliotoxin tri sulfide and gliotoxin tetra sulfide, respectively. Indeed in the high resolution mass spectra of Components A, B, C, the fragmentation patterns are identical except for the initial additional losses of sulfur for Components B and C. These effects are contained in Table 1. The uptake of carbon by TGM was inhibited 82 with gliotoxin 1000 ng ml . The concentration of gliotoxin which resulted in one half the observed effect ED₅₀ in ng ml was similar for all particles and for both elicited and resident cell populations. Adherence to plastic surfaces, which is akin to phagocytosis for macrophages and monocytes was inhibited by gliotoxin in a dose dependent manner as reflected in the values for ED₅₀ Table 1 . Table 7 illustrates the effects of a variety of epipolythiodioxopiperazines on phagocytosis by macrophages. All of these compounds inhibit phagocytosis. Table 8 demonstrates that other fungal metabolites which do not possess the epipolythiodioxopiperazine moiety have no activity. The fact that the dimethylthioether derivative of gliotoxin also has no activity in this assay emphasizes the essentiality of the epipolythiodioxopiperazine moiety of these compounds.

Thus, they are useful in the suppression or formation of or proliferation of immunocytes or lymphocytes and are therefore useful in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, and suppressing the rejection of transplants e.g. thyroid, skin and pancreatic islet cells. Details are as below. The apparent cellular nature of the immune damage in this disease and the macrophage component thereof provides for a good model for effects of said compounds on macrophage function For all the above uses, the dosages will of course vary depending on the compound employed, mode of administration and treatment desired.
