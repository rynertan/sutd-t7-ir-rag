# HIGH SPEED MODEM SUITABLE FOR OPERATING WITH A SWITCHED NETWORK

## Abstract
A high speed modem suitable for operating with a switched network and capable of achieving essentially 9600 bit per second information transfer rate through the switched telephone network. The high bit rate is achieved notwith standing the variations in the characteristics of the switched telephone network by phase and amplitude modulating a plurality of sub carriers 39 at a relatively low baud rate. Correlation detection 35 is employed at the receiver 33 38 to extract or demodulate the information contained in the various sub carriers. To allow correlation detection with orthogonal signals, each of the sub carriers is harmonically related to a fundamental which fundamental is, however, slightly higher than the baud rate. This allows the receiver 33 38 to delay correlation for a gap time, which reduces the effect of transients produced by modulation and also provides greater tolerance to inter symbol distortion. Since the fundamental of all the sub carriers is higher than the baud rate, the receiver sees orthogonal signals during the integ ration or correlation time which is maintained as the period of the fundamental. In addition to the information sub carriers, a pair of unmodulated sub carriers 36 are also transmitted to enable the receiver to maintain the correlation interval in proper synchronization with the transmitter, and to correct for phase distortion and frequency offset.
