# Method of plating aluminium.

## Abstract
Aluminum containing 1 8 alloyed zinc is free from grease and organic contaminants, e.g. by the use of alkaline and etching cleaners cathodically cleaned employing sulfu ric acid, to free it of any oxide film, and then subjected to ca thodic deposition of cyanide and borate salts. A bronze coat ing 58 88 tin is then electrodeposited on to the alumi num up to one hour after. A final, lustrous decorative coat ing e.g. of chromium or nickel, may then be electrodeposited thereon.
