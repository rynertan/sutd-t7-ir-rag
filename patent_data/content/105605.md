# Extended hub valve closure member.

## Abstract
A valve closure member 122 with a hub 128 which extends beyond the radius of the circumferential sealing region of the closure member to a point 144 greater than the extended edge of the lip 120 of the valve seat recess in the valve body. The extended hub is spaced from the circumferential sealing region 126 by a recess to receive a portion of the lip when the closure member is rotated.
