# Process for increasing deasphalted oil production from upgraded oil residua.

## Abstract
A process in fuels production for increasing the yield of deasphalted oil production from upgraded residua and improving deasphalter 42 operability involving mixing the upgraded residua with an aromatics solubilizing aid to prevent the formation of an immiscible third phase during deasphalting. The aromatics solubilizing aid may be selected from a cat cracker 36 fractionator stream of initial boiling point IBP from 260 to 430 C, a heavy cycle gas oil, a heavy coker gas oil and a distilled non upgraded residuum having an IBP not less than 370 C.
