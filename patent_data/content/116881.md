# MAGNETIC RECORDING MEDIUM AND PROCESS OF MANUFACTURING THE SAME

## Abstract
A magnetic recording medium comprising a substrate and a magnetic layer thereon, the magnetic layer a being a continuous magnetic layer made mainly from iron oxides, and b having not less than 0.5 of ratio between perpendi cular to plane residual magnetization and in plane residual magnetization of said magnetic layer, M A process of manufactuing a magnetic recording medium comprising a substrate and a continuous magnetic layer made mainly from iron oxides formed thereon and having not less than 0.5 of ratio between perpendicular to plane residual magnetization, M
