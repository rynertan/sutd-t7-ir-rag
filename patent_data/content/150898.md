# Novel pillared interlayered clays, processes for their production and uses thereof.

## Abstract
The invention relates to silanised pillared interlayered clays which are produced by hydrolysing a hydrolysable silicon compound in the liquid or vapour phase in the presence of a pillard interlayered clay or a precursor thereof. The resulting silanised clays are more active as catalysts and or more stable than the clays from which they are derived.
