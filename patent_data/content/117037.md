# Apparatus for freezing fertilized ova, spermatozoa or the like.

## Abstract
An apparatus for freezing fertilized ova, spermatozoa or the like is constructed to comprise a heat transfer bottom board block formed at the lower end of a heat insulating peripheral wall with a lower refrigerant passage capable of flowing refrigerant, a bottom board temperature sensor attached to the bottom board block, an upper heat transfer block placed on the bottom board block through a heat insulating joint member, formed with an upper refrigerant passage for flowing the refrigerant, a temperature control heater, an upper block temperature sensor, a plurality of erecting tube charging spaces of tubes opened at the top thereof with the bottom board block as a bottom member between the peripheral wall and the upper block in such a manner that the tubes respectively erected and charged into the spaces are cooled at the lower ends thereof by said bottom board block and at the upper part containing articles to be frozen such as fertilized ova, spermatozoa or the like contained in buffer solution in said tubes. Thus, the buffer solutions in the tubes can be controlled to be cooled at the buffer solution of the lower noncontaining part by said bottom board block and the buffer solution of the containing part above the buffer solution of the lower noncontaining part by said upper block.
