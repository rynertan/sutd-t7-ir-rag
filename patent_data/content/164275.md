# INFORMATION SIGNAL RECORDING MEDIUM

## Abstract
An information signal recording medium comprises a core material made of a non conductive material, and a sur face material made of a conductive material and in close adherence with at least one surface of the core material. Variations in geometrical configuration in accordance with information signals to be recorded on the recording medium are compression molded on the surface material. The ma terials constituting the surface material and the core material are selected so that a ratio V
