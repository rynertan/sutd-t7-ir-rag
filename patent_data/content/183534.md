# Skeletal tissue stimulator and a low voltage oscillator circuit for use therein.

## Abstract
A skeletal tissue stimulator and especially a bone growth stimulator 10 ano a circuit 12 adapted to be coupled to the skeletal tissue in a body, and especially bone tissue in the body, whose growth is to be stimulated, which tissue acts as a load 22 for the circuit 12 . The circuit 12 has a battary 24 and an oscillator circuit 26 which is adapted to be coupled to the load 22 . The oscillator circuit 26 is coupled to a storage device 28 which is charged from the battery 24 and discharged through the load 22 . The storage device 28 controls the state of the oscillator circuit 26 which in turn controls current flow from the battery 24 directly through load 22 . The bone growth stimulator 10 and circuit 12 are characterized in that all the current provided by the battery 24 must flow through the load 22 , either directly from the oscillator circuit 26 or as a result of discharge from the storage device 28 .
