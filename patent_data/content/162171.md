# METHOD OF CODE CHANGING FOR ELECTRONIC LOCK

## Abstract
A combination changing method is used in an access control system which includes one or more keys encoded at a central console with a function information code, a key identification information code, an operation select infor mation code and a two field key combination information code and one or more locks having at least one memory level in which a lock identification information code and a lock combination information code are stored. A key is initially inserted into a selected lock and the data from the key is transferred to the lock. The lock identification information code is first compared with the key identification information code. If there is no correspondence, power to the lock is turned off for a set period of time. If the identification infor mation codes correspond, a test field of the key combination information code is compared with the lock combination in formation code. If these correspond, the lock opens. If the identification information codes correspond but the test field of the key combination information code and the lock com bination information code do not, then the operation select information code is used to select from a predefined set of operations logical and or arithmetic and or other . The op eration selection is then performed on an operand field of the key combination information code. This results in a com puted combination information code which is compared with the lock combination information code. If this comparison is successful, the test field of the key combination information code is stored in the lock in place of the lock combination information code and the lock opens.
