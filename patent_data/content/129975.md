# Recovery of aluminium scrap.

## Abstract
In a process for recovery of aluminum metal from coated light gauge aluminum scrap the scrap fragments are first decoated and then fed substantially continuously onto the surface of a body of molten metal above a channel type induc tion heater. The molten metal is stirred to produce strong down flows at the molten metal surface to submerge the decoated scrap particles. The submergence may be effected by a coreless induction heater acting on the body of molten metal or other electromagnetic device such as one or more linear induction motors which are employed to set up a strong axial down flow at the center of the metal surface or to gener ate a vortex at that location.
