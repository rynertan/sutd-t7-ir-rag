# Robot system.

## Abstract
The present invention consists in a robot 15 wherein a slit light detector 12 which is constructed of a light projector 6 for projecting light so as to form a slit light on an object to be handled and an image detector 3 for detecting an image of the light section waveform, is mounted on an operating member 17 of the robot means 9 for scanning the slit light detector 12 is disposed and the slit light detector 12 detects range data, on the basis of which a position, posture, inclination etc. of the object in a three dimensional shape are detected, so that the robot 15 can handle the object.
