## Description
This invention relates to semiconductor photodetector devices and more particularly to depletion mode thin film semiconductor photodetectors, e.g., thin film transistors TFT s or photodiodes, especially suited for use in large area image sensor arrays. Because of its ease of deposition on transparent substrates over a large area and ease to obtain reproducible transistor operations, crystallized silicon TFT s show great potential in applications including large area displays, photodetectors, image sensors and integrated optics devices. Because of its photosensitivity, silicon has been employed in photosensors in the configurations of photodiodes, phototransistors and charge coupled devices. Ordinarily, these configurations are fabricated on bulk single crystalline silicon substrates. The overall size of such configurations is limited by the size of the silicon wafer. The use of light collection optics for reading a large image area requires a bulky sensing system. Because of the ease of deposition of amorphous silicon a Si H thin films on transparent substrates of arbitrarily large size, these thin films have been employed in large area image sensor arrays for contact document input scanners. See, for example, U.S. Patent 4,419,696. However, because of the low carrier mobilities in a Si H, the photosensitivity and the speed are, in general, found to be poorer than compared to sensors fabricated in bulk crystalline silicon c Si . Recent progress in laser crystallization have enabled formation of defect free, single crystalline silicon thin films on bulk amorphous substrates for formation of high performance TFT s to permit applications to direct view large area electronic devices such as flat panel displays and image sensors on transparent substrates. See for example, U.S. Patent 4,409,724. Recent demonstration of TFT shift registers also promises to broaden the field of application from local switching of individual transducers to include logic circuits having sufficiently high speed for data rates often encountered in image processing. See, for example, A. Chiang et al., in NMOS Logic Circuits in Laser Crystallized Silicon on Quartz , Proceedings of the 1983 Materials Research Society, Boston, Massachusetts, November, 1983, soon to be published in the book, Crystallization of silicon thin films on insulating substrates, e.g., fused quartz, in patterned and encapsulated configuration by a scanned CW laser have been well documented in the art. See, for example, U.S. Patent 4,330,363 and the book, These advances in the technology of laser crystallized silicon thin films on insulating substrates have produced numerous novel NMOS and CMOS thin film electronic devices with performances comparable or superior to that of bulk devices. However, the photosensitivity demonstrated in enhancement mode TFT s has not been sufficiently great to provide a desired level of S N ratio and dynamic range for contact input scanner applications such as high speed, high resolution in compact electronic copiers or printers or facsimile machines. A thin film semiconductor phototransistor according to the precharacterising portion of Claim 1 is known from DE A 2440325. According to this invention, a depletion mode thin film semiconductor photosensitive device has pronounced photosensitivity compared to comparable enhancement mode thin film transistors or amorphous silicon photodiodes, such as three or more orders of magnitude improved photoconductive gain in depletion mode thin film TFT photosensor of this invention over the photosensitivity of such prior devices. The present invention provides a thin film semiconductor photosensitive device comprising, on an insulating substrate, a crystalline silicon thin film with first and second electrode regions and a light sensing region formed therebetween, a gate oxide formed over said light sensing region, and a gate electrode formed on said gate oxide, characterized in that The p n junction located parallel to the surface of the substrate functions as a space charge separation region in the film for photogenerated carriers. In an embodiment of the invention, the second portion of the light sensing region comprises a p region functioning as a storage zone for holes while the first portion comprises an n region functioning as a current channel between the electrode regions of the photosensitive device by forming a storage zone or potential well for electrons. A TFT photosensor of this invention, with n source and drain electrode regions functioning as an ohmic contacts to the channel n region, exhibits high photoconductive gain with low background signal and even at low light intensities when the device is operated with a fully depleted channel by a reverse biased gate, ie., when the n channel region is fully pinched off by an applied gate voltage to the gate electrode which is sufficiently negative as compared to the threshold voltage of the photosensor. When the drain electrode region is replaced by a p region functioning as an ohmic contact to the p region of the lightsensing region, a depletion mode gated diode is formed. When a plurality of linearly spaced gate electrodes are formed on the gate oxide region with an input diode formed adjacent to the first of such gate electrodes and an output diode formed adjacent to the last of such gate electrodes, the device functions as a charge coupled device. By way of example only, embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

Figure 7 is a cross sectional illustration of a depletion mode gated photodiode of this invention. Figure 8 is a cross sectional illustration of a depletion mode buried channel charge coupled device of this invention. Referring now to Figure 1, there is shown the thin film depletion mode TFT photodetector 10 of this invention. Photodetector 10 comprises a buried channel thin film transistor on a transparent and insulating substrate 12, such as fused quartz. Substrate 12 can be of other insulating material such as glass or ceramic plates. The transparency of substrate 12 is useful for sensing light at the transistor through the substrate, although fabrication also permits transmission of light through the polysilicon gate electrode 22 of the transistor. In any case, substrate 12 may be chosen to be transparent or nontransparent depending upon the desired design for light transmission to an integrated semiconductor array including transistor photodetectors 10 of this invention. Transistor photodetector 10 comprises a crystallized Si thin film layer 13 which is patterned by photolithography into a discrete island. Layer 13 may be, for example, be 0.5 µm thick. The range of thickness for layer 13, and correspondingly the channel region 11 formed by regions 14 and 16, may be in the range, for example, of about 0.3 µm to 50 µm. It is doped by conventional techniques e.g., ion implantation to form a lower half p type region 14 e.g. boron and an upper half n type region 16 e.g., phosphorus forming a p n junction 15. Gate oxide layer 20 is thermally grown by oxidizing the n layer 16 followed by depositing n polysilicon layer 22 comprising the gate electrode. Gate oxide layer 20 may, for example, be about 0.13 µm thick and polysilicon gate 22 may be about 0.35 µm thick. The source and drain regions 26 and 28 are formed on opposite sides of the channel region 14 and 16 by As implantation to form highly doped n regions functioning as ohmic contacts to channel 16. Source electrode 30 and the drain electrode 32 may be comprised of vapor deposited Al. Transistor photodetector 10 may be formed by fabrication techniques known in the art. For example a 0.5 µm thick layer of LP CVD polysilicon on a fused quartz wafer may be patterned by photolithography and plasma etching to provide a plurality of islands which are then subjected to a laser melting treatment to bring about recrystallization. Laser crystallization is accomplished with a scanned CW CO₂ laser spot which is offset from the center of the islands to generate a tilted solidification front which it is scanned across each of the islands. This technique produces predominantly 100 textured, and 100 oriented crystal silicon islands without sub grain boundaries. After laser crystallization, fabrication of the TFT s may be carried out, for example, with an NMOS process with six mask levels as described in the previous paragraph and in A. Chiang et al, Proceedings of SPIE Symposium on Laser Processing of Semiconductor Devices Vol. 385, 76 1983 , and in the book The p layer 14 in the depletion mode TFT photodetector 10 of Figure 1 is formed by implantation of boron ions through the gate oxide prior to deposition of the polygate electrode 22 to give an acceptor concentration of about 10¹⁷ cm³ in the lower region 14 of layer 13. Similarly, the n layer 16 is formed by implantation of phosphorus ions to achieve a donor concentration of comparable density in the upper region 16 of layer 13. The acceptor and donor concentration may be in the range of 10¹⁶ cm³ to 10¹⁸ cm³. For comparison of photosensitivities, enhancement mode TFT s are fabricated with a nearly identical process. The only exception in the fabrication process is the replacement of the n layer 16 with a lightly doped p layer by implantation of boron ions to obtain a donor concentration of 2 x 10¹⁶ cm³ in the upper half of the channel region, i.e., region 16. The photosensitivity of a depletion mode and an enhancement mode TFT of identical geometry are compared in Figures 2A and 2B. The drain current for each device illuminated with 400 µW cm² green light through the substrate, I For V For V The silicon island forming photodetector 10 is about 0.5 µm thick and absorbs only 25 of the incident light, the fundamental photoconductive gain, G, may be as large as 3440 electrons absorbed photon, if reflection is ignored and unity quantum efficiency is assumed. Such a large gain in an n type photodetector with ohmic contacts implies a very long electron lifetime which can be estimated from an alternate definition for photoconductive gain, G set forth in Equation 1 . For L equal to 20 µm, V The physics of the depletion mode TFT photodetector 10 can be qualitatively explained with the aid of an energy band diagram of the channel region 14 and 16 shown in Figure 3. The solid lines E The gate bias induced depletion layer and the junction depletion layer in the n region 16 merge to form a potential minimum about 0.1 µm beneath the Si SiO₂ interface. Similarly, a potential maximum also exist in the p region 14 because of the depletion by a positive fixed oxide charge in the substrate characteristic of silicon devices fabricated on SiO₂ substrates. Photo generated electron hole pairs are separated by diffusion and drift across the p n junction. Electrons are collected in a buried conducting channel defined by the potential minimum in the n layer and holes are collected in the potential maximum in the p layer 0.2 µm away from this minimum. Under constant illumination, this charge separation reaches a steady state condition with each type of carrier making a distinct contribution to photoconductivity. Holes remain in the floating p layer as space charge while electrons in the buried channel contribute to photocurrent until they recombine with holes across the p n junction and to a much smaller extent at the top or bottom interfaces 17 and 19. As the electrons are electrostatically confined in the buried channel away from the holes in the p layer and from the Si SiO₂ interfaces which generally have more defects than the bulk, the recombination process is greatly inhibited. Consequently, the photoelectrons effectively contribute to the photocurrent for times exceeding the transit time of the channel, giving rise to a photoconductive gain G, as defined in Equation 1 , much greater than unity. Thus the major contributing factors for such high level of photosensitivity in the depletion mode TFT photodetector of this invention are This photoconductive gain of several 1000 s electrons absorbed photon in depletion mode TFT of this invention is much superior to that in phototransistors of the art that characteristically have a G of approximately 100. To compare with thin film photodetectors known in the art and fabricated of other material or structure, the µ In terms of photodetector performance, the depletion mode TFT photodetector 10 referred to in Figures 1 and 2, with only a 0.5 µm thick silicon film 13 to absorb 10 in the red, 25 in the green and 60 in the violet, can be operated with appreciable photosensitivity throughout the visible range and with nearly linear low light level responses. Figure 4 shows the spectral photoresponsivity, defined as the ratio of photocurrent to incident power, for TFT photodetector 10. For illumination through the polysilicon gate 22 with an 18W tungsten incandescent lamp, responsivity illustrated by curve 52 is in the range of about 200 300 Amp Watt incident power and it is to be noted that photodetector 10 is nearly panchromatic in the visible range. For illumination through the transparent substrate 12, illustrated by curve 54, the responsivity is correspondingly higher because the incident power is comparatively higher. Again to be noted is that photodetector 10 is nearly panchromatic in the visible range. In Figure 5, photocurrent change relative to illuminated incident power level is disclosed. Curve 56 is linear and shows a linear dependence on incident power down to about 1 µW cm², which is indicative of the low light level photosensitivity of TFT photodetector 10. Further optimization of the device geometry and doping conditions should lead to even more desirable photodetector operations in terms of large photocurrent, low noise, wide dynamic range, and customized spectral sensitivity. High speed 10 µs line , high resolution 10 µm channel width, or up to 2500 lines in contact imaging page wide document input scanner should be achievable. If even higher speed is desired, a tradeoff between photoconductive gain and detection speed can be obtained in such high gain depletion mode photodetectors without too much sacrifice in photosensitivity. This can be achieved by varying dopant concentrations to change the p n junction barrier height and thereby altering the generation recombination process and lifetime of the photocarriers. As the depletion mode TFT is a standard component of NMOS logic circuitry, a large area image sensor array with its own charge integration, amplification and logic circuits may be fabricated with an NMOS process developed for laser crystallized TFT s with little differences or modifications. Figure 6 depicts an application for TFT photodetector 10 in a large area image sensor array 60 wherein the drain region outputs 62 are supplied to charge integration and amplification circuits 64 where the signals on lines 62 are integrated over time and amplified. The amplified signal is provided via lines 66 to a series of shift registers and image processing circuits 68 where the signals are buffered and image processed for serial output on line 70. The principle of buried channel photoconduction in thin film devices to avoid surface recombination and lengthen photocarrier lifetime is applicable to other device configurations to make viable thin film photodetectors on large substrates with photosensitivities that are at least comparable to, if not better than, that found in their counterparts fabricated in the bulk silicon substrate. For example, Figure 7 discloses the photodiode version of the semiconductor photodetector of this invention. Photodiode 10A is essentially the same in construction as TFT photodetector 10 of Figure 1 except drain region 28 is replaced by a highly doped p region 28A functioning as an ohmic contact to p region 14. The depletion mode buried channel thin film gated diode 10A may be employed as a photodetector with close to unity gain but much higher operating speeds, such as in the range of nanosecond response, compared to its TFT photodetector 10 counterpart in Figure 1. Diode 10A provides a charge separation mechanism for a negative biased photodiode wherein photogenerated carriers can be separated and collected in reverse biased conditions in the buried channels in both the p and n regions 14 and 16 with high efficiency. Amplification of the output at terminal region 28A of diode 10A can be carried out with an integrated TFT circuit fabricated with NMOS or CMOS process with the same thin film structure as shown in Figure 1 immediately adjacent to the diode terminal region 28A. For another example, Figure 8 discloses a thin film buried channel charge coupled device CCD 10B fabricated with essentially the same process as the depletion mode TFT photodetector 10 except the channel region between the input diode ID 30 equivalent to source and the output diode OD 32 equivalent to drain can be as long as several inches, and the gate electrode 22 is segmented into many individual gate electrodes 22 each defining an image sensing site. The first gate electrode 22A is the input gate IG and the last gate electrode 22B is the output gate OG of CCD 10B. This device may be operated like a buried channel CCD photodetector built in bulk silicon with expected and comparable performance but with comparably higher operating speeds. Again, the realization of thin film CCD 10B permits the integration of the photodetector array with various readout capabilities, for example, with other electronics over large area substrates. While the invention has been described in conjunction with a few specific embodiments, it is evident to those skilled in the art that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent in light of the foregoing description. For example, reverse polarity of the dopants for photoconduction with holes can be accomplished by doping regions 26 and 28 as p and lower region 14 with n and upper region 16 with p.
