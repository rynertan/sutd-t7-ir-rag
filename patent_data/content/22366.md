# A sensor circuit including a sensing device.

## Abstract
A sensor circuit includes a sensing device comprising a sensor element 1 the impedance of which varies according to the concentration of water vapour, gas or the like and, disposed integrally therewith, a heating element 12 for heating said sensor element 1 . The above integrated structure precludes entry of the electric signal 10 applied to the heating 2 element into the impedance detection signal of the sensor element 4 , thus ensuring an accurate detection of changes of impedance of the sensor element.
