# Process for the copolymerization of propylene.

## Abstract
In a copolymerization process of propylene, a mixture of unreacted propylene and ethylene is recovered. It is then fed to a distillation system which includes first and second distillation columns. The distillation system is operated in such a way that the temperature and pressure of the top of the second distillation column remain constant and an ethylene propylene mixture can be recovered at a constant ethylene propylene ratio from the top of the second distilla tion column. By using the thus recovered ethylene propylene mixture, the copolymerization reaction can be carried out under excellent control so that the ethylene propylene copolymer can be obtained with uniform quality and properties.
