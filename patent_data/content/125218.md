# LINEARIZED TRAVELING WAVE AMPLIFIER WITH HARD LIMITER CHARACTERISTICS

## Abstract
A travelling wave tube 10 has a helical slow wave struc ture 18 including a sever 21 . A dynamic velocity taper is provided by gradually reducing the spacing 26 between the adjacent repeating elements of the slow wave structure, which are the windings of the helix. The red uction takes place between Z
