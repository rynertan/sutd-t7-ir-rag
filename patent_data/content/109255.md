## Description
DESCRIPTION GLYCEROL DERIVATIVES The present invention is concerned to new glycerol derivatives. More particularly, this invention is concerned to new glycerol derivatives having antagonistic effect on platelet activating factor abbreviated as PAF hereafter , hypotensive effect like PAF, inhibitory effect on phospholipase and further, inhibitory effect on growth of tumour cell or induction of differentiation, and, furthermore, this invention is concerned to the process for their preparation and pharmaceutical composition comprising them as active ingredients. Recently, the study on the release reaction of active amine dependent on leukocyte from platelet, has been energetically carried out. As a result, a substance strongly inducing platelet aggregation was discovered and it was named asPAF cf. J. Immunol., 106, 1244 1971 , J. Exp. Med., 136, 1356 1972 and Nature, 249, 581 1974 . Thereafter, it was confirmed that PAP exists in various animals including human beings. In 1979, its chemical structure was identified cf. J.Biol. Chem., 254, 9355 1979 and C. R. Acad. Sci., Serve D Paris , 289, 1017 1979 and has turned out to be a mixture of two alkylphospholipids of the following general formula wherein n is 15 and 17 cf. J. Biol. Chem., 255, 5514 1980 EMI2.1 wherein n represents 15 or 17 . It was found that PAF has not only strong secretory effect on platelet aggregation known at that time, but also powerful hypotensive effect and bronchodilating effect. PAP is considered to be one cf platelet aggregating factors in human beings, and further, one of substances inducing allergy and inflammation. Accordingly, there is a great possibility that compounds having antagonistic effect on PAF inhibitory effect on PAP may become a platelet aggregation inhibitor, anti asthmatic agent, anti allergic agent or anti inflammatory agent. Furthermore, PAP is considered to become a hypotensive agent without inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation by selecting hypotensive effect out of various effect. Widespread investigations have been carried out in order to discover compounds possessing antagonistic effect onPAP or hypotensive effect like PAF, we have already proposed glycerol derivatives of the general formula EMI2.2 tb 1 SEP A1 R11 SEP tb 2 SEP SEP SEP B Rê tb 3 SEP D R R4 tb wherein A represents an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom, B represents an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom, D represents an oxygen atom or a carbonyloxy group i.e.EMI3.1 in which the carbonyl group should be attached to a group R and the oxa group should be attached to the carbon atom at the third position of the glycerol skeleton , R represents an alkyl group of 6 to 22 carbon atoms, or an alkyl group of 2 to 5 carbon atoms being substituted by a phenyl group, Rê represents, when B is an oxygen atom, a hydrogen atom, or a group of the general formula EMI3.2 COR or CONHR , in which R5 represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or an alkoxy group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R6 represents an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or a phenyl group and R7 represents an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or a phenyl group, and R represents, when B is a sulfur atom, a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or a group of the general formula EMI3.3 CS OR , in which R8 represents an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or a phenyl group and R5 is as hereinbefore defined, R3 represents an alkylene group of 1 to 12 carbon atoms atoms and R4 represents an amino group, or a group of the general formula NHCOR9 , NHR10 , N R10 2, R10 3. , in which R9 represents an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or a phenyl group, an represents an alkyl group of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, with the proviso that, when R4 represents a group of the formula N R10 2 orEMI4.1 two or more of R10 may be same or different to each other, and Y represents an anion of an acid , and non toxic acid addition salts thereof see the UnitedStates Patent ApplicacLon No. 494481 and European PatentApplication No. 8310445.3 . It has no re found that by replacing the group of the formula B Rê in compounds of the above general formula by an amino group or derivatives thereof, the pharmacological effects of new glyce l derivatives hereinafter described as compounds of the general formula I are, in some aspects of their effects, improved or modified, having completed this invention. Furthermoe, it has been found that the compounds of the present invention of the general formula I have inhibitory effect on phospholipase A2 and phospholipase C. PhospholipaseA2 and phospholipase C dependent on calcium in a living body are concerned in the mechanism for the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids. It is known that arachidonic acid is released by physiological stimulus and then becomes incorporated into the metabolic routes of prostaglandins and is finally metabolized to thromboxane A2 having a strong effect on platelet aggregation, to other prostaglandins or to various leukotrienes being a significant bronchostrictor in an asthmatic paroxysm.Accordingly, it is considered that compounds having an inhibitory effect on phospholipase A2 and phospholipase C, which are concerned in the mechanism for the release of arachidonic acid, can become a platelet aggregation inhibitor, anti asthmatic agent, anti allergic agent or anti inflammatory agent, based on the inhibition of phospholipase A2 and phospholipase C, having a different mechanism from PAF antagonist and further, being different from conventional anti inflammatory agents represented by aspirin based on the inhibition of cyclooxygenase. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention of the general formula I show inhibitory effect on growth of tumour cell and induction of differentiation and, therefore, are may be useful as anti tumour agents. Accordingly, the present invention provides new glycerol derivatives of the general formula EMI5.1 tb 1 SEP O RÚ tb 2 SEP SEP Rê SEP I tb 3 SEP A R R4 tb wherein A represents an oxygen atom Or a carbonyloxy group i.e. O CO , in which the carbon group should be attached to a group R3 and the oxa group should be attached to the carbon atom at the third position of the glycerol skeleton , R1 represents an alkyl group of 6 to 22 carbon atoms, or an alkyl group of 2 to 5 carbon atoms being substituted by a phenyl group, R2 represents an azido group N3 group , an amino group NH2 group or a group of the general formula NHCOR5, NHCOOR5 or NHCONHR5,in which R5 represents an alkyl group of 1 to 10 carbon atoms or a phenyl group, with the proviso that, when A represents a carbonyloxy group, Rê does not represent an amino group, R3 represents an alkylene group of 1 to 12 carbon atoms and R4 represents an amino group, or a group of the general formula NHCOR6, NHR7, N R7 2 or 7 e in which K represents an alkyl group of 1 to 6 N R 3.Y, in which R represents an alkyl group of 1 carbon atoms or a phenyl group, R7 represents an alkyl group of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, with the proviso that, when R4 7 represents a group of the formula N R7 2 or N R 3 Y, two or more of R7 may be same or different to each other, and Y represents an anion of an acid , and non toxic acid addition salts thereof. Throughout the specification including claims, the term alkyl or alkylene means a straight or branched chain alkyl or alkylene group. As is obvious to those skilled in the art, the compounds of the general formula I have at least one asymmetric center, i.e. the carbon atom at the second position of the glycerol skeleton. When the alkyl or alkylene moiety of various substituents represented by RÚ, Rê, R3 and R4 represents a branched chain, there is a possibility that other asymmetric centers are occurred. The existence of an asymmetric center forms isomers as is well known. However the compounds of the general formula I in the present invention are concerned with all isomers or mixtures thereof.
