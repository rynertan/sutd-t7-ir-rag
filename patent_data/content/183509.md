## Description
This invention relates to an eletrophotographic developing method, and more specifically, to a magnetic brush developing method for forming a toner image of high quality by using a two component developer comprising a magnetic carrier and a chargeable toner. The invention also pertains to a method for forming an image of high quality easily and conveniently without the need for a high level of mechanical precision in a development section. In electrophotography using a two component magnetic developer, a chargeable toner and a magnetic carrier are mixed and the two component mixture is fed onto a development sleeve equipped with a magnet therein to form a magnetic brush composed of this mixture. By bringing the magnetic brush into frictional contact with an electrophotographic plate bearing a latent electrostatic image, a chargeable toner image is formed on the electrophotographic plate. The chargeable toner, upon frictional contact with the magnetic carrier, is charged to a polarity opposite to that of the latent electrostatic image on the electrophotographic plate. The toner particles on the magnetic brush are attracted and adhered to the latent electrostatic image by the Coulomb force whereby the latent electrostatic image is developed. On the other hand, since the magnetic carrier is attracted by the magnet within the sleeve and its charge is of the same polarity as the charge of the latent electrostatic image, the magnetic carrier remains on the sleeve. For the frictional contact of the magnetic brush with the photosensitive plate, two methods are available, one involving moving the two in the same direction, and the other involving moving them in opposite directions. These methods have their own advantages and disadvantates. The former method of moving the two in the same direction permits soft contact between the magnetic brush and the surface of the photosensitive plate. Hence, the reproducibility of a halftone is excellent and the quality of the resulting image is generally good. But with this method, it is difficult to obtain a high image density. According to the latter method, the magnetic brush contacts the surface of the photosensitive plate while it is in the compressed state, and therefore, a high image density is easy to obtain. On the other hand, it has the defect that the resulting image has a defect called brush marks which are many rows of slender and short white lines extending in the rubbing direction of the brush, or other defects such as tailing frequently occur in the resulting image. It is an object of this invention to provide an improvement in a magnetic brush development wherein the photosensitive plate and the magnetic brush are moved in the same direction, and particularly an improved magnetic brush development method capable of forming a toner image having high quality and a high density. In accordance with this invention, the above object is achieved by a development method for forming a toner image of high quality, which comprises supplying a two component developer composed of a mixture of magnetic carrier particles and toner paricles chargeable by frictional contact with the magnetic carrier particles onto a development sleeve comprised of a non magnetic sleeve and provided therein, a magnet having alternately and circumferentially arranged magnetic poles of different polarities to thereby form a magnetic brush of the developer, and bringing the surface of a photosensitive drum bearing a latent electrostatic image into frictional contact with the magnetic brush while a bias voltage is applied between the photosensitive drum and the sleeve thereby to form a toner image corresponding to the latent electrostatic image characterized in that a brush cutting doctor is disposed on the non magnetic sleeve so that the tip of the doctor is positioned nearly centrally between two magnetic poles of different polarities, and the development is carried out while moving the photosensitive drum and the development sleeve in the same direction at the site of frictional contact and using a developer in which the concentration Ct, of the toner is determined by the following equation wherein Sc is the specific surface area cm² g of the carrier, St is the specific surface area cm² g of the toner, and k is a number of from 0.80 t 1.14. The invention will now be described in detail with reference to its preferred embodiments in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. In one example of a developing device used in this invention which is shown in Figure 1, a magnet roll 1 having many magnetic poles N and S is received within a sleeve 2 made of a non magnetic material such as aluminum. The magnet roll 1 is fixed and the sleeve 2 is provided so as to rotate in the direction of the arrow, i.e. in the counterclockwise direction. A two component developer 3 is supplied to the sleeve from a developer agitating and supplying roller 4 to form a magnetic brush 5. The magnetic brush 5 rotates with the sleeve 2 and thus moves in the same direction as the rotating direction of the sleeve. A brush cutting doctor 7 is provided above the sleeve 2 so that its tip 6 is positioned nearly centrally between magnetic poles N and S. The doctor 7 cuts the magnetic brush 5 to a predetermined length. In proximity to the non magnetic sleeve 2 is disposed a drum 9 having an electrophotographic layer 8. The electrophotographic layer 8 is rotates so that it moves in the same direction as the moving direction of the magnetic brush 5 in a development zone 10. As a result, a latent electrostatic image on the photographic layer 8 is rubbed by the magnetic brush 5 and developed by the chargeable toner. A first characteristic feature of the invention is that the brush cutting doctor 7 is disposed in the aforesaid positional relation, and the moving directions of the photosensitive drum 9 and the development sleeve 2 are made the same at the position of frictional contact. This feature is employed in this invention for the following reasons. The development of a latent electrostatic image formed on the photosensitive drum is carried out by forming a magnetic brush of a developer composed of a toner and a carrier on the development sleeve 2 and bringing the magnetic brush into frictional contact with the photosensitive drum. The conditions for the frictional contact between the magnetic brush and the photosensitive drum at this time are important, and the quality of the resulting copy depends upon the control of these conditions. Since the present invention contemplates the production of copies having high quality, the length of the magnetic brush is adjusted and the photosensitive drum and the development sleeve are moved in the same direction at the position of frictional contact so as to avoid any excessive force during frictional contact. To adjust the brush length, the doctor is disposed so that its tip is positioned between magnetic poles. At this position of the development sleeve, the magnetic flux is not concentrated as at the position of the magnetic poles, and the magnetic force acting on the developer is weak. Therefore, the developer does not form a brush but exists densely by its own weight on the surface of the sleeve. Accordingly, if the brush is cut at this position, it can be adjusted to a predetermined length with good precision. Since the magnetic restraining force at this position is weak, no excessive restraining force acts on the developer nor slippage of the developer occurs on the surface of the sleeve. The slippage of the developer , as referred to herein, denotes a phenomenon in which since the magnetic interacting forces of the developer particles are large at a position near the magnetic poles where the magnetic restraining force is strong, the restriction of the tip portion of the magnetic brush results in restriction of the entire magnetic brush and hence the magnetic brush fails to move. Accordingly, if the magnetic brush is restricted between magnetic poles, cutting of the brush can be carried out stably over a long period of time, and the frictional conditions mentioned above can be easily controlled. Consequently, the latent electrostatic image can be developed to a toner image having excellent quality with an increased image density, a high resolution and excellent gradation without a significant scattering of the toner. A second characteristic feature of the invention is that the development is carried out while the concentration Ct, of the toner in the developer is determined by the following equation wherein Sc is the specific surface area cm² g of the carrier, St is the specific surface area cm² g of the toner, and k is a number of 0.80 to 1.14. By a combination of these first and second features of the invention, the resulting image has an improved density, resolution and gradation and is free from fogging. In equation 1 , the term Sc St Sc on the right side relates to the specific surface areas of the carrier and the toner. Specifically, it is a value expressing the proportion of the surface area of the carrier based on the total surface area of a mixture of equal weights of the carrier and the toner to be referred to as the carrier surface occupancy ratio . In the present invention, when an electrostatic image is developed with the two component developer under conditions such that the concentration of the toner becomes equal to this carrier surface occupancy ratio or a value close to it, the density of the resulting image is increased simultaneously with a decrease in fog density, an increase in resolution and an improvement in gradation. The difference between the concentration of the toner Ct and the carrier surface occupancy ratio Sc Sc St , can be evaluated by determining the ratio of the two, namely the coefficient k of the following formula The coefficient The investigations of the present inventor has shown that when the coefficient In the invention, the specific surface area Sc of the carrier in equation 1 means a measured value obtained by the transmission method. The transmission method is described in detail at pages 108 to 113 of Powder Handbook , edited by Japan Powder Industry Association, published by Nikkan Kogyo Press. The specific surface area St of the toner in equation 1 means an effective specific surface area which is calculated on the basis of the volume average particle diameter of the toner measured by a Coulter counter, under the assumption that the toner particles are true spheres. Specifically, it is calculated in accordance with the following formula where r is the radius cm determined from the volume average particle diameter measured by a Coulter counter, and p is the true specific gravity g cm² of the toner. The reason for the determination of the specific surface area St of the toner in this way is that since the radius of the toner is much smaller than that of the carrier, the frictional contact of the toner with the carrier is limited to the raised portions on the surface of the toner and there is virtually no problem if only the raised portions on the surface are assumed to be an effective surface for triboelectrical charging and that this assumption well agrees with the experimental fact. In the present invention, the developer containing the toner in the concentration is determined by the above equation 1 is applied to the developing method characterized by the first feature mentioned above. According to the first feature, the electrostatic image can be developed to a toner image of excellent quality. This, however, is possible only when the conditions of the developer itself are optimal. Accordingly, the first feature of the invention is inseparable from the second feature regarding the concentration of the toner defined by the empirical equation 1 . From another viewpoint, good conditions for the developer is determined by equation 1 , but this toner concentration should be satisified at the magnetic brush with which the development is performed. As stated above, the doctor for adjusting the length of the brush to a predetermined value is used in the formation of the magnetic brush. If this adjustment is carried out in a state in which a strong force is exerted on the magnetic brush, the concentration of the toner is adversely affected. With regard to the developer on the sleeve, it is only the carrier to which the magnet roll directly imparts a conveying force. Hence, the restricting force of the tip of the doctor is liable to act on the toner which has not gained this conveying force from the magnet roll. In other words, the toner is only electrostatically bound to the carrier. As a result, the toner is detached from the carrier which tends to move against the restricting force upon the action of the magnetic conveying force thereon. Thus, since in the above state, the toner is detached from the carrier by the strong restricting force of the doctor, the developer adjusted to a predetermined toner concentration will have a toner concentration lower than the adjusted value when it is on the magnetic brush on which it contributes to the development. In the present invention, since the restricting force at the time of brush cutting can be decreased in accordance with the first feature, the variations in toner concentration during the application of the doctor can be suppressed and the concentration of the toner in accordance with the second feature can be maintained effectively. For the foregoing reason, the best developing conditions can be maintained in this invention by the effective interaction of the conditions defined by the first and second features. A toner image of high quality can be formed in accordance with this invention by varrying out the magnetic brush development method which satisfies a combination of the first condition relating to the positional relation of the brush cutting doctor and the relation of the moving directions of the drum and the sleeve and the second condition relating to the concentration of the toner. In the present invention, a toner image having higher quality can be formed by combining the above two conditions with one of the following two additional conditions. A first additional condition concerns the relation between the distance brush cutting clearance The first additional condition is that the development is carried out under conditions defined by the following expressions where This embodiment of the invention is based on the new discovery that a toner image having a satisfactory density and quality can be formed by selecting the difference b a of the two clearances above within a specified range depending upon the electric resistance of the carrier. Figure 2 of the accompanying drawing is obtained by plotting the experimental results in an example to be described above. The electrical resistance R of the carrier is taken on the abscissa, and the difference b a of the clearances, on the ordinate. In Figure 2, the double circular marks refer to images having a density of at least 1.00 with no trouble in image quality. The X marks refer to images having an image density of less than 1.00. The triangular marks refer to images having quality defects such as trailing end missing, or having a reduced resolution. The straight lines in Figure 2 are defined by the following equations. It will be understood from Figure 2 that to form an image having a high density and high quality, it is very critical to prescribe the developing conditions such that the b a and logR values come within the region defined by the four straight lines I , II , III and IV above. The difference b a between the development clearance and the brush cutting clearance has closely to do with the development time which is the time during which the magnetic brush is in contact with the surface of the drum. If the difference b a becomes larger, the development time becomes shorter. If the difference b a becomes smaller, the development time becomes longer. If a carrier having a high electric resistance is used, the development time must be long in order to obtain the desired image density, namely the desired development current. On the other hand, with a carrier having a low electric resistance, a sufficient image density can be obtained by development for a short period of time. From the standpoint of preventing a decrease in the potential of the latent electrostatic image, the development time should preferably be shorter. The development in this embodiment of the invention very well agrees with the experimental results plotted in Figure 2. Specifically, in a region above the straight line II or on the right of straight line III, the image density is very low. In a region below the straight line I or on the left of straight line IV, the frictional contact is excessive, and consequently, the quality of the resulting image is considerably degraded. In contrast, according to this invention, an image having a high density and high quality can be obtained by performing the development under conditions defined by the area surrounded by these straight lines. The clearance According to the aforesaid embodiment of this invention, the development method has a very important advantage in practice in that the aforesaid advantage can be achieved without requiring a high level of mechanical precision in a developing section. If the b a is set at nearly the middle of the aforesaid region, namely so as to substantially satisfy the following equation according to the electrical resistance of a carrier used at the time of designing the developing device, errors of 0.2 mm or more can be completely absorbed, and the work of accuracy adjustment during assembling can be reduced. Furthermore, without so much increasing the accuracy of the development section, an image of high quality can be easily obtained. A second additional condition pertains to the relation between the peripheral speed V The second additional condition is that the development is carried out under conditions which satisfy the following expressions where V This embodiment of the present invention is based on the finding that according to the developing conditions for the aforesaid method, there is an optimum range of the ratio of the peripheral speed of the development sleeve to the peripheral speed of the drum V Figure 3 is a graphic representation showing the relation between the peripheral speed V The straight lines in Figure 3 are defined by the following expressions It will be understood from Figure 3 that to form an image having a high density and high quality, it is very critical to prescribe the development conditions so that the values of V The peripheral speed V In a region below straight line II in Figure 3, the breaking of the image or its insufficient density is remarkable due to the insufficient supply of the toner, and there is a large tendency to fogging due to insufficient frictional contact. In a region above straight line I, trailing end missing occurs in the resulting image, or its resolution tends to decrease. Furthermore, the tendency to toner scattering increases. In contrast, according to this embodiment of the invention, an image having a high density and high quality and being free from fog attributed to toner scattering can be obtained by performing the development under conditions defined by the region surrounded by the straight lines in Figure 3. In the developing method, the other developing conditions may be those known The carrier used may, for example, be a ferrite carrier or a known iron powder carrier. As the ferrite carrier, sintered ferrite particles, particularly spherical sintered ferrite particles, are used advantageously. The sintered ferrite particles preferably have a particle diameter of 20 to 200 µm in general. If the particle diameter of the sintered ferrite particles is less than 20 µm, the flowability of the ferrite particles is reduced, and troubles tend to occur in the mixing and stirring of the carrier with the toner. On the other hand, if the particle diameter of the ferrite particles is larger than 200 µm, the amount of the toner that can be mixed becomes excessively small, and its control becomes difficult. The sintered ferrite particles that can be used in this invention are known Advantageously, the iron powder carrier has an electric resistance within the range described hereinabove and a particle diameter of 30 to 300 µm, and is particularly in the form of roundish particles with the corner portions removed. The toner that can be used in this invention may be any colored toner having chargeability and fixability. It may be a granular composition having a particle diameter of 5 to 30 µm comprising a binder resin and dispersed therein, a coloring pigment, a charge controlling agent, etc. The resin may include thermplastic resins, uncured thermosetting resins and initial condensates of thermosetting resins. Suitable examples of the resin include, in decreasing order of importance, vinyl aromatic resins such as polystyrene, acrylic resins, polyvinyl acetal resins, polyester resins, epoxy resins, phenolic resins, petroleum resins and olefinic resins. The pigment may be one or more of carbon black, Cadmium Yellow, Molybdenum Orange, Pyrazolone Red, Fast Violet B, Phthalocyanine Blue, etc. Examples of the charge controlling agent include oil soluble dyes such as Nigrosine Base C150415 , Oil Black Cl26150 and Spilon Black, metal naphthoates, fatty acid metal soaps, and resin acid soaps. In the present invention, a bias voltage is applied between the photosensitive drum and the development sleeve. The bias voltage is prescribed such that the charge is sufficiently injected into the toner during development, but troubles such as discharge breakdown do not occur in the photosensitive drum or the magnetic brush. The suitable bias voltage is generally 100 to 500 volts, particularly 150 to 300 volts. The polarity of the bias voltage should be the same as that of the charge of the photosensitive drum. Known electrophotographic materials may be used as the photosensitive plate. Examples are a selenium vapor deposited photosensitive material, amorphous silicon photosensitive material, a CdS photosensitive material, and an organic photoconductive photosensitive material. A latent electrostatic image may be formed on the photosensitive material by methods known The following Examples illustrate the present invention more specifically. A copying test was carried out under the following conditions in a copying machine having a developing device of the type shown in Figure 1 built therein. Under these conditions, 10,000 copies were produced continuously at the varying toner concentrations indicated in Table 1. The toner concentration was detected by a commercial magnetic sensor Model TS 003, a product of TDK , and the toner was supplied as required so as to maintain the toner concentration at a predetermined value. The results show that in the developing device shown in Figure 1, the resulting copies can be used substantially for practical purposes at a k value in the range of 0.8 to 1.07.
