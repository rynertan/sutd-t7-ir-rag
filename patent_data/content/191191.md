# Improvement in adhesive tapes.

## Abstract
In making pressure sensitive tapes having an olefinic polymer or copolymer support, in particular polypropylene, or a support of coextruded film of an olefinic polymer and of another polymer or copolymer, modification of the ad hesive by addition of a mineral or synthetic oil brings about a substantial reduction of noise upon unwinding the tape. Said modification can be combined with modification of the release coat provided on the back of the tape and or with special treatment of the support back.
