# Long stroke, high resolution optical position sensor.

## Abstract
A high resolution optical position sensor for measuring the linear displacement of a reciprocating device with a long stroke, includes a code plate 12 having a substrate com prised of a fiber optic faceplate 16A having a plurality of parallel optical waveguides 70 which are fused together and aligned perpendicular to each of two major surfaces of the faceplate, and an optical mask 14 with serial transparent and opaque regions encoded in each of a plurality of bit channels disposed on one of the two major surfaces of the faceplate, a portion of the plurality of optical waveguides being in regist ration with the transparent regions of each bit channel.
