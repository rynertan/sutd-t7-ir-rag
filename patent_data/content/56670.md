# Assembly comprising a heat recovery device.

## Abstract
Complementary device which is incorporated in the combustion gas discharge duct of a gas or oil fired heating apparatus with a liquid or air circuit, substantially comprising a supply and a discharge connection for the combustion gases to be passed through, a heat exchanger to be installed between the combustion gases and the liquid or air circuit, and a fan with which the combustion gases can be forced past the heat exchanger. Means are provided by which, if the fan is operating the combustion gases are forced to flow through the heat exchanger, to be subsequently led in the direction of the combustion gas discharge, and by which, of the fan is not operating or is operating inadequately, the combustion gases from the heating apparatus are led at least in part direct to the combustion gas discharge duct. The heat exchanger extends at most partly in the combustion gas discharge duct, and means are present to lead the gases, after heat exchange, obliquely upwards into the combustion gas discharge duct in such a manner that they form a gas shield extending substantially across the transverse section of the combustion gas discharge duct.
