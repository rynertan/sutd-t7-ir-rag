## Description
A tool for tightening and slackening large threaded parts such as tubes and the likeThe invention described herein is a tool for thightening and slackening threaded parts, especially those having larger dimensions such as tubes, pipes etc.The need for tightening or slackening of large threaded components such as wide diameter tube, hydraulic reservoirs and so forth, is encountered not infrequently furthermore these parts or components are invariably apt to be located in positions with little ease of access. Whether for the difficulty in laying hold of the part, or the difficulty in reaching it, the need arises for special kinds of tool.Conventional tools in current use make use of flexible or articulated elements which wind around the part or component to be screwed tight or slackened like tools are furnished with any one of a variety of devices which produce drag in the articulated or flexible element wound round the workpiece the articulated or flexible element thus transmits torque to the part to be tightened or slackened, producing the desired screwing tight or unscrewing of the part or component itself.It is often the case that such tools are unwieldy or awkward to use as a result of difficulty experienced in reaching the work.One object of the invention herein is that of providing a tool for tightening or slackening large threaded parts which enables working on components out of easy reach or awkward to lay hold on.A further object of the invention is that of providing a simple, inexpensive and compact tool.A further object of the invention is that of creating a tool which may be used in conjunction with others normally untilised by fittersgmaintenance men.These and other objects are attained to by the tool described herein which is characterised by the fact that it comprises a cylindrical body provided with a shank which, paireditii acoventjonal .wrench spannr of the appropriate size, allows for rotation of the cylindrical body around its own taxis, to which the extremity of a chain is permanently attached in such a way that the axis of rotation relative to each link thereof lies parallel with the, said cylindrical body s axis locking means designed for making the said chain fast to the said cylindrical body by any one of the individual links thereof.Further features and advantages of the invention will emerge more clearly from the detailed description which follows of a preferred, though not exclusive form of embodiment of the tool described herein, illustrated as a strictly unlimited example with the aid of the accompanying drawings, in which Fig 1 shows a vertical elevation of the tool to which the invention refers, in that position wherein one extremity only of the chain is attached to the cylindrical body of same Fag 2 shows a vertical elevation of the tool described herein, in that position wherein the chain thereof is wrapped around th work to be tightened or slackened, the latter illustrated only in part Fig 3 shows a cross section according to ttl t tI in fig 2, illustrating the tool to which the invention refers engaging a part or component to be tightened or slackened.The tool described herein comprises a cylindrical body 1 provided with a shank 2 the shank 2 may be any one of a variety of types viz. prismatic with square hexagonal cross section, or splined or similar, and, paired with a conventional spanner wrench of correct size which needless to say must be of corresponding cross section to the shank furnishes the means for causing the cylindrical body 1 to rotate around its own axis. The wrench in question clearly could be a box spanner, socket wrench or any other kind.The lateral surface of the cylindrical body is given axially disposed knurling, for reasons which will become apparent hereafter.The cylindrical body 1 comprises a cylindrical mid section 5 of a lesser diameter than that of the body 1 as a whole, being defined by an annular recess 6 located in the cylindrical body 1 itself.One extremity of a chain 3 is permanently attached to the cylindrical body 1 and disposed in such a way that the axis of rotation of each link thereof lies parallel with the cylindrical body 1 axis provision is made for attachment of the chain extremity to the cylindrical body by means of a first pin 7 threaded through the end link of the said chain itself and fixed permanently to the cylindrical body a second pin 8 fixed likewise to the cylindrical body 1 holds the end link afore mentioned hard against the cylndr ical mid section 5.Pins 7 8 are disposed internally of annular recess 6 with axes parallel to that of cylindrical body 1 the extremities of pins 7 8 being bedded into the fla,nk walls of annular recess 6.The tool described herein further comprises locking means designed for locking the chain 3 to the cylindrical body 1 by any one of its several links.The locking means comprises a third pin 9 which may be inserted into or withdrawn from cylindrical body 1 to this end there is a hole 12 located in the lower section of the cylindrical body 1 which admits the introduction of the said third pin 9. The extremity of the pin 9 is threaded in order to be screwed into a further, second hole 13 located in the upper section of the cylindrical body 1.As per pins 7 8, pin 9 is disposed with axis parallel to that of cylindrical body 1, being likewise positioned internally of annular recess 6 said pin 9 is disposed all but diametrically opposite to second pin 8.The function of the tool thus described is as follows Chain 3, having one extremity permanently fixed to cylindrical body 1 and one extremity free, is wrapped around the part or component to be tightened or slackened, for instance around a tube 10 as illustrated inFigs 2 3 chain 3 is then fastened to cylindrical body 1 in such a way as to maintain contact to all intents and purposes between cylindrical body and part component to this end one of the chain links is introduced into annular recess 6, whereupon pin 9 is inserted into holes 12 13 in such a way that the chain link introduced into annular recess 6 is lodged between pin 9 itself and cylindrical midsection 5. In this manner pin 9 holds said chain link fast against cylindrical mid section 5 thereby fastening chain 3 itself to cylindrical body 1.It will be clear that, according to the size of the part or component to be tightened or slackened, links correspondingly nearer to or farther from that permanently fixed must be fastened to the cylindrical body 1 the surplus stretch of chain remains free, offering no hindrance to the tools normal function.Cylindrical body 1 is then caused to rotate in either direction by means of an appropriate implement engaging shank 2 in response to said rotation chain 3 is obliged to wrap around cylindrical body n thus gripping tube 10 tightly and imparting torque thereto causing tightening up or slackening off of same.Once pressure exerted upon the wrench is relaxed following the rotation of cylindrical body 1, the body itself remains anchored to tube 1Q by virtue of th afore mentioned knurling on its lateral surface, thereby disallowing any sudden loosening of chain 3.Provision may therefore be made for the implement used in rotating cylindrical body 1 to engage shank 2 in such a way as to prevent its sudden wihdrawal therefrom this may be achieved by a spring loaded ball catch, for instance, located on shank 2 which seeks out a countersink made in spanner or wrench, or by, any arrangement of grooves, splines etc located either on shank 2 or corresponding implement. In any event such means of engaging wrench and socket would be of the conventional kind Should a wrench be used of the kind which remains united to the tool, it will be possible once the latter is safely.anchored to the tube 10 to position if assembling or extract if dismantling the tube without needing to lay hold thereon.The special shape of the tool described thus allows its being used for tightening or slackening threaded parts or components in the most inaccessible of locations in fact, dimensions of the tool are such that , being small, the tool may be applied to the workpiece in practically any position whatever, a fact which makes for ease of access with a wrench or spanner to the shank 2.Numerous modifications of a practical nature may be applied to the tool design, for instance the shank may be male or female to accommodate whatever kind of wrench, spanner or extension bar etc. without straying from within the bounds of protection afforded to the basic concept as described above, and as claimed below.
