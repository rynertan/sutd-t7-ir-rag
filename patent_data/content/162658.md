# Apparatus and method for checking time slot integrity of a switching system.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method are disclosed for checking the time slot data word integrity of data communications in a time multiplexed communication system. A predetermined control bit BIT 1 of each data word of a date frame is al ternately switched from its normal control bit function to a bit of a pseudo random sequence PRS for time slot data word integrity checking. During alternate data frames a checking circuit 220 compares the predetermined bit of re ceived consecutive data words against consecutive bits of a reference PRS and outputs a time slot cross connect error signal ERR when a difference occurs.
