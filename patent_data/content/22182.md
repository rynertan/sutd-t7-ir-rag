# Synthetic polyester pulp and process for preparing same.

## Abstract
Synthetic polyester pulps are provided which are comprised of substantially fibrous fibrils made of a linear aromatic polyester, said fibrils i having branches at least in part thereof, ii being of an oriented crystalline structure, iii having cross sectional shapes that have irregular and unusual contours, and iv exhibiting a freeness of from 50 to 700 cc. The fibrils preferably possess an average fiber diameter of smaller than about 10 microns and a fiber diameter variance of not larger than about 0.7. The pulps are prepared by a process, which comprises the steps of forming a shaped article from a mixture of a linear aromatic polyester and an organic compound which is incompatible with said polyester and soluble in an alkaline solution treating the shaped article with an alkaline solution so that the polyester ingredient in the shaped article be at least partially hydrolyzed and the organic compound be at least partially dissolved in the alkaline solution and then, beating the alkaline solution treated shaped article.
