# Laminated plastic container and process for preparation thereof.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a laminated plastic container in the form of a bottle 1 , the wall 2 of which comprises a substrate 5 formed of a melt moldable plastic material, a coating layer 6 formed on at least one surface of the substrate, said coating layer being composed of a copolymer consisting essentially of 99 to 70 by weight of vinylidene chloride and 1 to 30 by weight of at least one acrylic or methacrylic monomer and further including up to 100 parts by weight of at least one member selected from other ethylenically unsaturated monomers per 100 parts by weight of the total amount of said two monomers, said copolymer having a defined oxygen permeation coefficient and a defined water vapour permeability coefficient, and a protecting surface layer 7 of a film forming synthetic resin other than a vinylidene chloride resin, which is formed contiguously to said coating layer 6 .
