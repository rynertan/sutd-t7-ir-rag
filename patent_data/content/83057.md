# Aqueous sized glass fibers for reinforcing thermosetting polymers.

## Abstract
Sized glass fiber strands are provided, that have an improved slip flow property and resultant thermosetting articles reinforced with the sized glass fiber strands have improved impact properties. The aqueous sizing composition has a poly vinyl acetate silane copolymer, epoxy polymer, one or more lubricants, an organo silane coupling agent, which may be an amino silane coupling agent, lubricant modified amino organo silane coupling agent, epoxy containing silane coupling agent vinyl containing silane coupling agent or a mixture of one or more of these coupling agents, one or more nonionic surfactants, a polyethylene containing polymer and or a wax, a hydrocarbon acid and water. Polyethylene polymer is present in an amount of about 0 to about 25 weight percent of the solids of the aqueous sizing composition. The wax is present in an amount of about 0 to about 5 weight percent solids of the aqueous sizing composition. The amount of the hydrocarbon acid present is that sufficient to give a pH for the composition in the range of about 4 to around 9. The amount of water present in the aqueous sizing composition is that sufficient to give a total solids for the composition of about 1 to about 30 weight percent. The sized glass fiber strands have good choppability in that there is not a high amount of fly or fuzz produced during the chopping operation. The sized glass fiber strands in any form may be used for reinforcing thermosetting polymeric material.
