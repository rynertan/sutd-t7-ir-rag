## Description
The present invention is concerned with novel compounds having an antiallergic activity and their manufacturing methods. Certain types of cells, for example, mast cells release the chemical mediators which mediate the allergic reaction in response to antigen antibody reactions. As the chemical mediators participating in the immediate allergic reaction, histamines and SRS A slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis are looked upon as important, but the latter plays the most important role particularly in the bronchial asthma. SRS A is the mixture of leukotriene Câ‚„ Therefore it is expected from the drugs which antagonize to the action of SRS A to be useful as antiallergic agents. At this time, only a few drugs are known to have such an activity, but none of them are known to have such an activity when used internally. The EP A O 181 779 falling under Art. 54 3 EPC is directed to 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic compounds having 1 to 3 hetero atoms selected from the groups containing an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom, and a nitrogen atom, for example isothiazole ring, pyrazole ring, and a pyrimidine ring, etc. including optical isomers based on the existence of an asymmetric carbon atom which are useful for the prophylaxis and treatment of various allergic diseases for examples bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, urticaria, etc. and ischemic heart diseases. The object of the present invention is to provide compounds having the general formula I A further object of the present invention is a process for the preparation of compounds of the general formula I , A further object of the present invention is a process for the preparation of compounds of the general formula I , A further object of the present invention is a process for the preparation of compounds of the general formula I , As a result of the extensive investigation on the compounds having an antiallergic action, the present inventors have found that novel compounds shown by a formula I have an excellent anitallergic action, in particular, extremely powerful inhibitory action on the anaphylaxis, which may be caused by SRS A, even when used internally, According to the present, invention the compounds shown by the general formula I can be manufactured through various pathways. I The compounds wherein n means 0 in the general formula I with the exclusion of 4 3 2 benzimidazolylthio propoxy 2 hydroxy 3 propylacetophenone, can be manufactured through allowing the compounds of the general formula II to react with phenoxyalkyl derivatives of the general formula III . Typically, they can be manufactured through allowing the compounds of the general formula II to react with phenoxyalkyl derivatives of the general formula III in a suitable solvent, for example, methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran or the like, and in the presence or absence of the base, for example, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydride or the like, In following, the present invention will be explained by using concrete examples. But the invention is not confined to them. Manufacture of 2 isopropyl 3 thiocyanopyrazolo 1,5 a pyridine To a solution of 3 g of 2 isopropylpyrazolo 1,5 a pyridine in 56 ml of methanol was added 5.74 g of potassium thiocyanate and stirred at room temperature. 3.3 g of bromine was dissolved in 13 ml of methanol saturated with potassium bromide and added dropwise to the previous solution. Then, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for an hour, poured into 130 ml of water and resulting precipitate was filtered and dried. This crude pre cipitate was recrystallized from methanol to give 3.53 g yield 87 of the aimed compound as pale yellow prismatic crystals. mp 91 92.5 C. Manufacture of 2 methyl 3 thiocyanopyrazolo 1,5 a pyridine This compounds was synthesized by the same method as referential example 1 using 2 methylpyrazolo 1,5 a pyridine instead of 2 isopropylpyrazolo 1,5 a pyridine. Pale yellow powder yield 50 . mp 111 113 C. Manufacture of 3 3 4 acetyl 3 hydroxy 2 propylphenoxy propylthio 2 isopropylpyrazolo 1,5 a pyridine To a suspension of 1 g of 2 isopropyl 3 thiocyanopyrazolo 1,5 a pyridine described in referential example 1 in 25 ml of methanol was added 2.6 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and stirred at room temperature. To this solution was added 1.3 g of zinc powder little by little, then stirred at room temperature for an hour. This solution was diluted with 40 ml of water and extracted with dichloromethane twice, then organic layer was combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was reacted with the same method as example 1, the crude products were purified by flash column chromatography dichloromethane benzene 2 1 and then recrystallized from n hexane to give 750 mg yield 38 of the aimed compound as colorless needles. mp 95 95.5 C. Analysis for Manufacture of 3 3 4 acetyl 3 hydroxy 2 propylphenoxy propylthio 2 isopropylpyrazolo 1,5 a pyridine S oxide To a solution of 800 mg of 3 3 4 acetyl 3 hydroxy 2 propylphenoxy propylthio 2 isopropylpyrazolo 1,5 a pyridine described in example 2 in 25 ml of dichloromethane, cooled with ice salt water bath below 0 C, was added 405 mg of m chloroper benzoic acid and stirred at 0 C for 15 minutes. To the reacting mixture was added 4 g of calcium hydroxide and stirred at room temperature for 10 minutes, then precipitate of suspension was filtered off with Celite. The filtrate was further washed with 5 aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. The crystalline residue was recrystallized from dichloromethane n hexane to give 770 mg yield 93 of the aimed compound as colorless powder. mp 145 146 C. Analysis for Manufacture of 3 3 4 acetyl 3 hydroxy 2 propylphenoxy propylsulfonyl 2 isopropylpyrazolo 1,5 a pyridine To a solution of 2 g of 3 3 4 acetyl 3 hydroxy 2 propyl phenoxy propylthio 2 isopropylpyrazolo 1,5 a pyridine described in example 2 in 50 ml of dichloromethane, cooled with water bath below 15 C, was added 2.22 g of m chloroperbenzoic acid and stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. The purification procedure was same as described in example 3. The resulting residue was further recrystallized from dichloromethane n hexane to give 1.98 g yield 92 of the aimed compound as pale yellow powder. mp 169.5 170.5 C. Analysis for Using the procedure described in examle 1 to 4, compounds shown in Table 1 were synthesized. The compounds presented here have shown the potent antagonizing effect on
