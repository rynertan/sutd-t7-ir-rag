# THERMAL DECOMPOSITION OF ALUMINUM CHLORIDE HEXAHYDRATE

## Abstract
Aluminum chloride hexahydrate is thermally decomposed to alumina by sequential treatment in two dense fluidized bed decomposers, the first decomposer being operated at a tem perature of about 200 to 400 C and the second at a tempera ture of about 900 to 1100 C. About 90 to 95 percent decompo sition is achieved in the first decomposer, with substantially complete decomposition of the remainder in the second de composer. Fluidization in the first decomposer is preferably achieved by means of recycle of product gases.
