# Ultrasonic imaging system.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic imaging system utilising a multi element ultrasonic transducer array for transmission and reception of ultrasonic signals wherein a different number of elements L is used in reception compared to transmission so as to reduce sidelobes in the resultant ultrasonic beam pattern. The elements may also be focussed to a different focal length in reception compared to transmission so as to obtain increased depth of field.
