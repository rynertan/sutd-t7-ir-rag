# Surface treatment of paper and paperboard.

## Abstract
Paper or paperboard 10 which has been thoroughly dried, but not calendered is provided with a smooth surface by rewetting a thin layer along one surface thereof and then pressing the resulting damp surface against a substantial portion of the surface of a heated smooth surfaced drying cylinder 20 . This technique provides the web 10 with a surface comparable in smoothness with that which can be obtained by calendaring, but without the degree of compaction which occurs in calendaring, due to the fact that with the major portion of the web dried, it is highly resistant to such compaction.
