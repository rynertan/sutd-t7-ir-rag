# PHOTOCHROMIC PHOTOSENSITIVE COMPOSITION.

## Abstract
A photochromic photosensitive composition containing a benzothiazolinospiropyran compound represented by the following general formula Addition of a phenol compound to the composition serves to further enhance the heat stability. As compared with conven tional photochromic compositions, this photochromic photo sensitive composition is thermally extremely stable in a colored state, and the colored image can be stored for an enough long time to be suited for long time recording.
