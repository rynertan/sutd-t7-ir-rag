# Polyester compositions for gas and moisture barrier materials, barrier materials formed from said compositions and a container formed from a layer of said barrier material.

## Abstract
Polymer blends of a a polymer selected from the group consisting of a poly ester and copolymers thereof, and b a polymer selected from the group consisting of poly vinyl alcohol and copolymers thereof, may be fabricated into barrier packaging materials having very low permeabilities to oxygen, other fixed gases and moisture.
