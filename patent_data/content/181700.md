## Description
STEERING MECHANISM The present invention relates to an energy absorbing steering mechanism for use on a vehicle. It is known to use energy absorbing arrangements to minimise damage to a vehicle and avoid injury to occupants caused by high velocity impacts such as crashes. Examples of these arrangements include collapsible steering wheel columns for automobiles and landing gear assemblies for aircraft or helicopters. The present invention relates to an energy absorbing steering mechanism suitable for use with a vehicle such as a helicopter and which is capable of absorbing energy during high velocity impact such as is experienced in a crash landing. Thus according to the present invention there is provided an energy absorbing steering mechanism for a vehicle comprising a steering shaft comprising an elongate energy absorbing, t e a steering means connected to the upper end of the t r inS shaft, a steering gear connected to the lower end of the steering shaft, the tube being bonded to one or both of the steering means and steering gear, the longitudinal axial component of the bond being adapted to disrupt under crash impact and to allow the tube to progressively collapse and absorb the impact energy. The steering mechanism may be used on g number of vehicles such as for steering the wheels of a e, licopter or of ag automobile. The means for turning the drive shaft may be manual or power assisted as in an automobile or be motor dri,V , in a helico . The steering gear may be, gor ecs example, a rack and pinion arrtngement for an automobile. The energy absorber preferably comprises a hollow tube of composite material which is capable of progressive disintegration under an applied axial load. The composite material may be of fibres and resin. Examples of fibres include fibre glass, carbon fibre and Kevlar an aramid fibre . Examples of resins include polyester, phenolic and epoxy resins. The hollow elongate member is attached preferably by adhesive to the driveshaft. In the preferred configuration, a hollow tube is bonded by an adhesive to a peripheral collar on the shaft, the adhesive being adapted to have a peripheral bond sufficiently strong to allow steering forces to be transmitted through the hollow tube to the steered member eg wheels but having a bond along the longitudinal axis of the tube which is disrupted by a severe impact such as a crash. The peripheral collar preferably has a lower flange adapted to deflect debris from the disrupted tube outwards so that it will not contaminate other mechanisms. The invention will now be described by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of part of the underside of a helicopter. Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of an automotive steering column. Figure 3 shows examples of bonding between the energy absorbing composite tube and collar of the undercarrtage. The wheel 1 of the helicopter is connected to the piston 2 of a conventional shock absorber of the hydraulic type. The cylinder body 3 of the hydraulic strut is free to slide and rotate by means of a bearing 4 on the airframe 5. The steering for the wheel 1 is provided b a torque link 9 between the wheel axle and the cylinder body 3 of the strut and a further torque link between the atrfreme S and the cylinder body 3 being provided by the energy absorbing composite tube 7. The drive for the steering is provided by a motorlgear combination 6. The strut 3 is linked at its lower end to the composite tube 7 by means of a peripheral collar 8. The bonding of the peripheral collar 8 to the composite tube 7 is deigned so that it is sufficiently strong to transmit the steering torque from the motor 6 to the strut 3 but the adhesive bond will rupture in case of a sudden strong force along the longitudinal axis of the composite tube as would be the case during crash impact at helicopter landing. The peripheral collar 8 is turned outwards in the form of an Shaped flange at its lower end. This serves to deflect debris from disintegration of the composite tube outwardly and away from any mechanism which may be damaged by its presence. There is an inspection gap between the end of the composite tube and the outward flange of the peripheral collar 8. In normal use of the helicopter, the steering means or motor 6 under the control of the pilot is used to turn the wheels 1. The torque from the motor is transmitted to the wheels through the steering shaft or composite tube 7 via the steering gear or torque link 9. In case of crash landing of the helicopter, the force along the longitudinal axis of the strut 5 causes the adhesive bond between the collar 8 and tube 7 to disrupt, the tube 7 then collapsing and absorbing the eneergy of impact. The flange of the collar tends to deflect debris from the tube 7 away from any sensitive mechanisms. Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of an automotive steering column incorporating a steering mechanism according to the invention. A steering wheel 20 operates through a steering column 21 linked to the automotive chassis through a sliding upper bearing 22. The steering column 21 is attached to a first energy absorbing composite tube 23 through either bonded or rivetted joints 24. The first tube 23 is connected to one end of a similar second energy absorbing composite tube 25 through a further bonded or rivetted joint 24, the further joint being attached by a bearing 26 to the vehicle chassis. The other end of the second tube is linked by another bonded or rivetted joint 24 to the steering gear 27 or rack of the vehicle. Normal torsional steering loads are taken by the steel inserts and composite tubes through either bonded or rivetted joints. Under crash loads from the front of the vehicle the steering rack will be forced backwards. The bond joint at one of the lower tube inserts will fail due to the generated axial load and allow the composite tube to crush. The crush load is reacted into the vehicle chassis at an intermediate thrust bearing. In the event of the driver s chest contacting the steering wheel, one of the joints of the upper tube will disrupt due to the axial force, allowing the upper tube to crush. The crush load of this tube is chosen to ensure no damage is caused to the drivers chest. The crush load of the upper tube is reacted into the chassis at the central bearing. Figure 3 shows a number of different ways in which the bonding can be made between the composite tube and the peripheral collar.The walls of the collar and the composite tube may be tapered or cut away to give a design bond strength capable of taking steering forces around the periphery of the collar but which rupture along the longitudinal axis of the composite tube under severe forces such as during crash landing. The adhesive used in the bond between the collar and composite tube is suitably an epoxy or acrylic resin.The composite tube is fabricated from glass fibre and polyester resin. The following techniques may be used to control the strength of the bond between the collar and the composite tube, i the use of a tapered adhesive line thickness ii the use of tapered ends of either the tube or the collar and iii the control of the shear and axial moduli of the ends of the tube or collar. Figures 3 a , 3 b and 3 c shows bonding arrangements using a taper on the metal or collar fitting. In Figures 3 a and 3 c the tapers are at opposite ends of the fitting and Figure 3 b shows an untapered geometry. Calculations indicate that the ratio of axial to torsional strengths can be altered by approximately 10 by use of small tapers. More complex profiles would produce larger variations. Further control of bond strength may be achieved by changing the axial and shear elastic moduli of the ends of the composite material by varying the angle of fibre orientation in the composite tube. Theoretical calculation shows that a 30Z change in shear modulus of the composite material may produce a 20X change in the ratio of axial to torsional loads.
