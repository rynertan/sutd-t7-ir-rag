# Multiple sample needle assembly.

## Abstract
A multiple sample needle assembly includes a housing 12 with a chamber 28 therein. A first cannula 14 for insertion into a liquid source is in fluid communication with the chamber 28 . A second cannula 15 is movably posi tioned in the housing and is out of liquid communication with the chamber 28 when in a first position. A liquid flow mechanism 26 inside the chamber 28 is operatively responsive to inward movement of the second cannula 15 to a second position for allowing liquid to flow from the chamber 28 into the second cannula 15 . After the liquid has been collected, the flow control mechanism 26 automa tically returns the second cannula 15 to the first position.
