# Transmission provided with a variable V belt transmission and a hydrodynamic transmission.

## Abstract
A transmission provided with a hydraulically controlled variable V belt drive 2 in combination with a fluid coupling or torque convertor 1 hydrodynamic unit can be provided with a lock up 15,16,17 to close lock the hydrodynamic unit i.e. to have a direct mechanical connection between the input shaft 4 and the output shaft 10 of said unit. Said lock up is operable depending on the fluid pressure in the hydraulical operating cilinder 8 of the primary pulley of the V belt drive.
