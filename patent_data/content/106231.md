## Description
This invention relates to aminoglycoside antibiotic compounds, and more particularly to an improved process for the o demethylation ofO methyl containing aminoglycosides. The aminoglycoside antibiotics are a valuable therapeutic class of antibiotics which are useful in the treatment of susceptible bacterial infections. Once an aminoglycoside antibiotic has been in clinical use for a period of time, microorganisms resistant to the antibiotic s growth inhibition activity may develop. In many cases, the resistance is R factor mediated and is attributed to the ability of the microorganism to enzymatically modify the amino or hydroxyl groups of the antibiotic, and thereby reduce or eliminate its growth inhibition properties. Thus, there is always a need for new chemical entities which can be held in reserve to combat bacterial strains which have become resistant to treatment by clinically used aminoglycoside antibiotics. In the past, it has been found that the antibacterial and pharmacological properties of many naturally produced aminoglycoside antibiotics can be altered by structural modifications.As an example, certain chemical modifications in the gentamicin and kanamycin families of aminoglycoside antibiotics provide structures which are less toxic than the parent antibiotic. Further, in the same series, certain structural modifications alter the antibacterial spectrum advantageously either by increasing the antibiotic s intrinsic activity or by increasing the antibiotic s activity against resistant strains. As with the gentamicin and kanamycin families of antibiotics, it previously has been determined that chemical modification of fortimicin also called astromicin aminoglycoside compounds can result in derivative compounds which exhibit reduced toxicity or increased antibacterial activity with respect to particular susceptible microorganisms or which exhibit equivalent or reduced activity, but nevertheless are useful as reserve antibiotics in the event resistant strains should develop after a period of clinical use of one or more of the fortimicin antibiotics. One such chemical modification of the parent fortimicin compounds that has received attention is 3 O demethylation.For example, United States Patent No. 4,124,756 discloses reacting fortinicin B, or other appropriate derivatives containing the fortamine moiety, with excess metallic lithium. in an amine solvent, such as ethylamine or ethylenediamine, to obtain, e.g., 3 O demethylfortimicinB. The 3 O demethylated compound may then be 4 N acylated or alkylated to obtain other useful 3 0demethylfortimicin B derivatives. As a further example,United States Patent No. 4,187,297 discloses other 2 Nacyl and 2 N alkyl 3 O demethylfortimicin B derivatives which are produced by a similar method. While the foregoing 3 O demethylfortimicin compounds have been found to exhibit highly desirable properties, the methods disclosed in the foregoing patents for obtaining these compounds result in relatively low yields, and in slow and costly production. In order to overcome these problems, various alternative processes for producing 3 O dem.ethylfortimicins previously have been proposed.For example, United States Patent No. 4,220,756 discloses reacting lithium wire with ethylenediamine under an inert atmosphere at a temperature of about 80 to about 1160C. until a deep blue color appears, and thereafter stirring fortimicin B in the solution at room temperature until the blue color disappears to obtain 3 o demethylfortimicin B in a yield of about 54 . United States Patent No. 4,242,503 discloses reacting a fortimicin with hydroiodic acid or trimethylsilyl iodide to obtain the corresponding 3 O demethylfortimicin in a yield of about 10 to 30 . United States Patent No.4,230,848 discloses reacting a fortimicin with a boron trihalide, preferably boron tribromide, in an inert solvent, at a temperature of about 40C., removing residual solvent and boron trihalide, and then isolating the desired product by chromatography to obtain the corresponding 3 O demethylfortimicin in a yield of about 30 to about 40 . United States Patent No. 4,330,673 additionally discloses employing this technique in theO demethylation of other O methyl containing aminoglycoside compounds. While the O demethylation processes disclosed in these latter patents represent an improvement in yield over the O demethylation process of United StatesPatent No. 4,124,756, they still result in relatively low yields on the order of about 10 to 50 , and remain costly and inefficient processes for producing the desired compounds. It has now been determined that O methylcontaining aminoglycoside compounds can be O demethylated in improved yields, and frequently in yields exceeding 60 , by reacting an O methyl containing aminoglycoside compound with a boron tris haloacetate . The process of the invention is useful in the production of O demethylated aminoglycoside compounds having antibiotic activity in the production of o demethylated aminoglycoside compounds used as intermediates in the production of semi synthetic aminoglycoside antibiotics and for other purposes. In accordance with the process of the invention, an O methyl containing aminoglycoside compound is reacted with a boron tris haloacetate to obtain the corresponding O demethylated compound. For purposes of illustration, the inventive concepts will be hereinafter described in detail in connection with the O demethylation of fortimicin compounds. However, it is contemplated that the invention may be employed in connection with theO demethylation of any aminoglycoside compounds containing an O methyl group which remain stable upon mild acid treatment. Illustrative examples of such other aminoglycoside compounds which may be employed in the practice of the invention include, without limitation, the istamycins, the sannamycins, the dactimicins, the sporaricins, the seldomycins, such as seldomycin factor 5 and like O methyl containing compounds. In the case of dactimicin, the O demethylated derivative produced in accordance with the invention is 3 O demethylfortimicin A. The fortimicin compounds which can be O demethylated in accordance with the invention include, without limitation, such illustrative fortimicin factors as fortimicins A, B, C, D, E, KE, KF, KG, AH, AI, and derivatives thereof, such as the 4 N substituted fortimicin derivatives, the 6 N substituted fortimicin derivatives, the 2 N substituted fortimicin derivatives, and the 1 , 2 , 5 , and or 6 modified fortimicin derivatives, e.g., l epi fortimicin A, 2 epi fortimicin A, 2 deoxyfortimicin A, l epi 2 deoxyfortamicin A, 2 N glycylfortimicin A, 6 epi fortimicin A, 4 N L 2 hydroxy 4 aminobutyl fortimicin B, 2 amino 2 deoxyfortimicin A, 2 amino 2deoxy 2 epi fortimicin A, 6 N methyl fortimicin A, 2 deoxy 4 N beta aminoethylfortimicin B, 2,3 di epifortimicin A and other O methyl containing fortimicin derivative compounds. As used herein, the term laminoglycoside is intended to cover both the free base of such compounds and the nontoxic, pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of such compounds. Suitable salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the aminoglycoside starting materials or o demethylated products of the invention, or by reacting the free base with a suitable organic or inorganic acid. Illustrative salts include hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, bisulfate, acetate, haloacetate, oxalate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, borate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate and napsylate salts, and the like.In a presently preferred embodiment of the invention, the trifluoroacetate acid addition salt of the aminoglycoside to be O demethylated is used as a starting material, although other salts and or the free base may be used for this purpose. In accordance with the process of the invention, an O methyl containing aminoglycoside compound is reacted with a boron tris haloacetate to obtain the desired O demethylated aminoglycoside derivative. The boron tris haloacetate compounds useful as reactants in the process of the invention include boron tris trichloroacetate , boron tris trifluoroacetate , boron tris tribromoactate , boron tris triiodoacetate , boron tris dichloroacetate , boron tris difluoroacetate , boron tris dibromoacetate , boron tris diiodoacetate , and the like. presently preferred reactants for this purpose include boron tris trifluoroacetate and boron tris trichloroacetate , with a presently particularly preferred reactant being boron tris trifluoroacetate . The O demethylation reaction may be conveniently carried out in a suitable solvent or suspending agent medium. A suitable solvent or suspending agent may be any solvent, mixture of solvents, suspending agent and or mixture of suspending agents which does not react with the O methyl containing aminoglycoside or the boron tris haloacetate and which does not interfere with the O demethylation reaction.Suitable solvents include, for example, acetic acid or a halogenated acetic acid, and when the Q demethylating agent is boron tris trifluoroacetate , a presently preferred solvent medium is trifluoroacetic acid. The reaction may optionally be conducted under an inert atmosphere, such as under a nitrogen atmosphere. The use of an inert atmosphere is particularly desirable when a hygroscopic medium, such as a halogenated acetic acid, is employed as a solvent or suspending agent. In order to optimize reaction yields, it is desirable to employ at least about 1.0 equivalents of the boron tris haloacetate , more preferably at least about 1.2 equivalents of the boron tris haloacetate , based upon the amount of aminoglycoside in the reaction mixture, although amounts of the boron tris haloacetate substantially in excess of 1.0 equivalents may be employed if desired. The O demethylation reaction may be carried out at temperatures of from about 15 C. to below the decomposition or degradation temperature of the aminoglycoside, more preferably from about OOC. to about 500C., and most preferably from about 200C. to about 300C. At relatively high temperatures, such as above about 20C. in the case of fortimicin A, the aminoglycoside is subject to degradation, thereby limiting the ability to obtain the desired O demethylated derivative. At temperatures below about 150C., theO demethylation reaction proceeds too slowly to be commercially practicable. The reaction is allowed to proceed until a substantial amount of O demethylation has occurred, preferably until at least about 60 conversion to the desired O demethyl derivative has been obtained. The precise reaction time will depend upon many factors, including the nature of the aminoglycoside, the nature and amount of boron tris haloacetate employed, the nature of the reaction solvent, the reaction temperature, and other reaction conditions. In general, however, reaction times on the order of at least about 1 hour, more preferably at least about 5 hours, and most preferably at least about 24 hours are satisfactory. In a presently preferred embodiment, the reaction mixture is formed by adding a solution of the aminoglycoside in a suitable solvent, e.g., trifluoroacetic acid, to a solution of the boron tris haloacetate in the solvent. The boron tris haloacetate solution may be formed by dissolving the boron tris haloacetate in the solvent.Alternatively, the boron tris haloacetate may be formed in situ by reacting a boron trihalide, such as BBr3, BC13 and the like, with a haloacetic acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, and the like. When the boron tris haloacetate is formed in this manner in situ, it is a presently preferred practice to maintain the temperature of the reaction mixture below about 150C., and most preferably from about 100C. to about 100C., during formation of the boron tris haloacetate . AS a further alternative, the boron tris haloacetate may be formed in situ by adding a boron trihalide to a solution of the aminoglycoside in a haloacetic acid solvent, such as, e.g., trifluoroacetic acid, to complete the reaction mixture. After the desired degree of O demethylation has been obtained, the product may be recovered from the reaction mixture using conventional recovery techniques, such as by evaporation of excess boron tris trihaloacetate and or solvent, precipitation, crystalization, co crystalization, extraction, chromatographic separation and the like. If desired, the product may optionally be subjected to additional purification techniques, such as chromatographic separation, and may be converted to the free base and or to other pharmaceutically acceptable salts, in a conventional manner as will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
