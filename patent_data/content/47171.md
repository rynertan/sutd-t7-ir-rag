# PROCESS FOR IRRADIATION OF POLYETHYLENE

## Abstract
A process for the irradiation of homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene and higher Î± olefins is disclosed. The process comprises subjecting the polymer in the form of granules to an atmosphere of steam, irradiating the polymer in an inert atmosphere with electron or gamma irradiation and reducing the level of free radicals in the irradiated polyethylene by further subjecting the polymer to an atmosphere of steam. The preferred inert atmosphere is steam. The amount of irradiation used is less than 1.5 Mrad. The irradiated polymer, which exhibits improved processa bility and or product properties when compared with non irradiated polymer, may be used in a wide variety of end uses e.g. fabrication into film, pipe and other articles, using extrusion, injection moulding and blow moulding techniques.
