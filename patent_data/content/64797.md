## Description
Preparation of novel N diarylmethyl 3 amino Lt alkenaryl 2 azetidinonesThis invention relates to a process of preparing certain p lactams azetidinones which are useful as intermediates in the synthesis of pharmaceutically useful agents, and to the novel p lactams. In Tetrahedron Letters, No. 30 1979 , at page 2771,A. K. Bose et al describes the synthesis, from an a methyl ss methoxycarbonyl vinylaminoacetic acid EMI2.1 and an azomethine compound Schiff base derived from cinnamaldehyde and veratrylamine EMI2.2 in the presence of ethyl chloroformate and triethylamine, of the productEMI2.3 However, since the yield was low, and since the product 3 was an oil, it was necessary to recover it by silica gel chromatography. This synthesis. of a product usable in the synthesis of isocephalosporins is therefore not readily used on an industrial scale.We have now devised a new synthesis of this type whereby the azetidinone ring is synthesized, which provides novel intermediate compounds in good yield and with easy recovery.The processes according to the invention are represented by the following reactions carboxylic acid azomethine compound EMI4.1 The azetidinones D and E are novel compounds. Acid addition salts can be formed of compound D .The process of the invention thus comprises preparing anN diaryl 3 substituted amino 4 methylvinylbenzyl 2azetidinone of the formula D . An active acid anhydride derivative C is prepared from an a methyl p alkoxy carbonyl vinylaminoacetic acid of the formula A , wherein the alkyl group can, e.g., be methyl or ethyl the derivative C can be prepared i by various known processes, e.g. by a mixed anhydride process which uses a chloroformate ester such as ethyl chloroformate. In the reaction ii with the azomethine compound AB , triethylamine is preferred as the base but other bases such as pyridine or lutidine may be used. The reaction is conducted in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane, optionally mixed with 1,2 dichloroethane, chloroform or toluene.The further step iii of the process consists in treating the compound D with an acid, e.g. p toluene sulfonic acid, to give the 4 unsubstituted amino derivative E .Compound E can by acylated to produce various amido derivatives, e.g. with an acylating agent such as trichloromethyl chloroformate or thienylacetyl chloride in the presence of a base, as described in ourEuropean Patent Publication No. 0 023 097.The following Examples I and 2 illustrate steps i and ii of the process of the invention, and Example 3 illustrates step iii .Example 1To N 2 methoxycarbonyl 1 methylethenyl glycine potassium salts 63.3 g and triethylamine 30.3 g in dry dichloromethane 1,250 ml was added dropwise ethyl chloroformate 32.7 g in dry dichloromethane 100 ml at 200C, and stirred for 30 minutes at the same temperature.To the reaction mixture was added dropwise trans cinnamilidene di 2 anisyl methylamine 53.55 g in dry dichloromethane 150 ml at the same temperature, and the reaction mixture was stood overnight at room temperature and filtered over the filter aid Celite. The filtrate was washed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate 4 and then water, dried and evaporated in vacuo to give crude crystals, which were recrystallized from diisopropyl ether to give pure crystals of 4 2 phenylethenyl 3 2 methoxyzarbonyl 1 methylethenyl amino N di p anisyl methyl 2 azetizinone 76 . m.p. 164 1660C.

Example 3To 4 2 phenylethenyl 3 2 methoxycarbonyl 1 methylethenyl amino N di E anisyl methyl 2 azetizinone 58.7 g in dioxane 1,174 ml were added toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate 23.96 g and water 12.4 ml and stood overnight at room temperature. The mixture was cooled with ice water, and precipitates were collected by filtration and dried under reduced pressure to give, as white powder, 4 2 phenylethenyl 3 amino N di E anisyl methyl 2 azetizinone, p toluenesulfonic acid salts. m.p. 172 174 C.
