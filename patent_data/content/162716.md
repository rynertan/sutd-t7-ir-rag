# A process for preparing polymer particles.

## Abstract
Substantially spherical solid particles of a substantially uniform particle size are prepared by dispersing a solution of a polymerizable substance in a first liquid by means of a suitable emulsifier to form droplets of the polymerizable sub stance of a substantially uniform particle size, which are thereafter poured into a second liquid with which the first liquid is immiscible and which contains a sufficient amount of a reactant to polymerize the polymerizable substance. After the polymerization the substantially embodiment, an aqueous solution of an alkaline metal silicate, especially so dium silicate, is dispersed in a coparaffinate by means of a suitable emulsifier, and the emulsion is poured into an aqueous solution of the polymerization reactant to form gelled, substantially spherical hydrated silica particles.
