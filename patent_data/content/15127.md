# Fluid motor pump assembly.

## Abstract
A fluid pump or motor 10, 110 has a stationary cylinder block 28 , pistons 24 , and a swash plate type mechanism 36 to link reciprocation of the pistons with rotation of a shaft 46, 146 . A valve plate 66 rotates with the shaft 46, 146 , and controls the flow of fluid between low and high pressure connections 18, 16 22, 20 and ports 60 in the cylinder block 28 , leading to the cylinder bores 26 . The valve plate 66 is biased against the cylinder block 28 by an axially movable but non rotating balancing member 80 , which contains balancing pistons 88 , supplied with pressure from the ports 76, 78 in the valve plate 66 through passages 86 . The reaction from the pistons 88 biases the member 80 against the valve plate 66 . The balancing member 80 is also biased by the pressure from the high pressure connection 16 20 acting on a shoulder 96 .
