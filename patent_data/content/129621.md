## Description
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a process for fluidized catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons and catalyst regeneration. In a fluid catalytic cat cracking unit, catalyst is circulated in transfer lines between two vessels, a reactor and a regenerator each of which can be provided with a dense phase fluidized bed of the catalyst. The feed, generally a gas oil, is preheated and injected, usually with recycle feed, into one of the circulating lines which contains hot regenerated catalyst which is being moved, or transported, from the regenerator to the reactor. The catalyst vaporizes the fresh feed and recycle feed, and the vapor with steam is injected to atomize the liquid feed, and fluidize the catalyst. The feed is cracked at about 9000F in the fluidized bed of the reactor in an endothermic reaction which consumes the heat brought from the regenerator by the catalyst. Coke is deposited on the catalyst, this inevitably lessening its activity.The cracked products from the reactor are passed through a staged cyclone separator system which collects entrained catalyst fines and returns them to the reactor.The vapors are passed to a primary fractionator, which separates the gasoline and lighter products from the heavy products. The gasoline and lighter products are sent to a light ends recovery unit while the heavy material is separated and recycled to the reactor, or withdrawn from the unit. Regeneration of the catalyst by the removal of deposited coke, and heat balance of the unit are both essential and in commercial operations both are interrelated. Spent catalyst is withdrawn from the bottom of the reactor, stripped with steam, and then recycled, or conveyed by a stream of air into the regenerator where deposited coke is burned from the catalyst in a dense phase fluidized bed at temperatures ranging from about 11000F to 14000F. Entrained catalyst is removed by staged cyclone separators, and flue gas is removed from the stack.. The hot regenerated catalyst is withdrawn from the regenerator and transported to the reactor to supply heat to the latter. The spent catalyst recycled to the regenerator contains some unburned hydrocarbons, since it is not possible by present techniques to remove all of the hydrocarbon vapors from the catalyst by stripping.Hence, some hydrocarbon products are carried from the reactor to the regenerator and burned this consuming some of the regeneration air, and decreasing the yield of useful products. In the combustion, it is desirable to burn all of the coke in the regenerator to carbon dioxide which, if possible, is certainly not practical.Carbon monoxide is also formed. Carbon monoxide in the flue gas, however, represents wasted heat values, except to the extent that the carbon monoxide can be burned in downstream equipment for recovery of the wasted heat.The flue gases leaving the regenerator differ in composition depending upon the part of the regenerator bed the gases leave since there is only a small amount of lateral mixing of the gases ascending through the regenerator bed. Variations in the carbon monoxidecontaining flue gas composition leaving the regenerator can be troublesome. This is because the flue gas is often burned with air in a steam generator, or in a furnace which directly warms the fresh feed or heats other refinery streams. Variations in the carbon monoxide content of the flue gas creates undesirable process instability. It is desirable to burn all the carbon monoxide in a cat cracker regenerator to very low values, i.e., 500 ppm or less, to meet air polution regulations directly, or to conserve all the heat of combustion in the process. In this case it is desirable to have as good a gas distribution as possible inasmuch as it reduces the amount of excess oxygen required to meet the desired low carbon monoxide level. For example, a unit with poor solids gas distribution may require an excess oxygen content of 2 to 3 percent to obtain a 500 ppm carbon monoxide level, while a unit that has good solids air distribution can achieve the 500 ppm level with only 0.5 percent excess air. Some compensation for this unequal distribution of gases in the regenerator bed might be provided by introducing additional air at the location where the catalyst enters the vessel. However, this results in high local gas velocities in the bed which does little to dispose of the problem, and in fact may introduce new problems. It is, accordingly, the primary objective of the present invention to provide improved apparatus, and process whereby the velocity distribution of air is equalized throughout the bed. This object is achieved in accordance with the present invention embodying apparatus and process wherein spent, coked catalyst is admixed with combustion air externally to the regenerator and introduced through an annulus, annular area or zone around the spent, coked catalyst standpipe from which regenerated catalyst is removed from the regenerator and recycled to the reactor.Generally from about 3 percent to about 20 percent, preferably from about 5 percent to about 10 percent, of the total air introduced into the regenerator is introduced in this manner and the balance of the air, which is in itself sufficient for complete combustion, is introduced via a separate air inlet into the regenerator. This produces a more even flow of the spent, highly coked catalyst into the regenerator with the result that the coke is burned from the catalyst and a flue gas of more constant composition is produced throughout the regenerator. Hydrocarbon contaminants from the reactor, not removed by stripping, are also effectively burned and as a result, the flue gas generated in this portion of the catalyst bed differs little from flue gas formed in other parts of the bed. The invention, and its principle of operation, will be better understood by reference to the following more detailed description, and to the attached drawings, to which reference is made in the description. In the drawings Figure 1 depicts, for the most part schematically, a flow diagram of a cat cracking unit, inclusive of reactor, regenerator, and other downstream production facilities. Figure 2 depicts in partial section the pertinent portions of the regenerator, including particularly the improved apparatus features related to the present invention. Figure 3 depicts in partial section these improved apparatus features in somewhat greater detail that presented by the preceding figure. Referring first to Figure 1, there is described generally a reactor 10, a regenerator 20, and a fractionation column or fractionator 30 into which off gas from the reactor 10 is fed and fractionated into various product fractions, inclusive of heavy, intermediate and light catalytic gas oil fractions, unstabilized gasoline and wet gas. The usual feed to the reactor 10 is a virgin gas oil, or portion of a crude oil boiling between about 6000F and 10500F which contains an admixture of aromatics, naphthenes and paraffins. Catalyst is circulated rapidly in the U bend transfer lines 11, 21 between the reactor 10 and regenerator 20. The feed, which is usually a.heavy gas oil, is preheated and injected via line 12 into the stream of regenerated catalyst moving from the regenerator 20 to the reactor 10. The hot catalyst vaporizes the oil, and the vapors help to fluidize the catalyst in the reactor. This mixture flows into the reactor 10 where cracking takes place at temperatures usually ranging from 900 to 10000F. The reaction is endothermic and consumes the heat brought from the regenerator 20 by the catalyst. The cracked products pass out of reactor 10 through two stages of cyclones 13, 14 which collect entrained catalyst and returns it to the dense phase fluidized bed. Velocities at the outlet of the dense bed are normally 2.0 2.5 ft. sec. Upon leaving the cyclones, the vapors are transmitted via line 18 to the primary fractionator 30 which separates the heavy products from the gasoline and lighter components.The light products are passed on to the light ends recovery unit, a unit which forms no part of the present invention. The heavy material is separated and either recycled to the reactor 10 or withdrawn from the system. Carbon, or coke, is all too rapidly deposited on the surface of the catalyst and covers the active sites and, since catalyst activity falls as a result of coke deposition thereon, it is desirable to restore the activity of the catalyst by oxidizing coke or carbon deposits therefrom. In normal operation, the catalyst is held in the reactor stripper vessel 10 only about 1 2 minutes. This is accomplished by the rapid circulation of catalyst between reactor 10 and regenerator 20 via lines 11, 21, which in the large units may represent a solids transfer as high as 40 50 tons minute. The spent catalyst is withdrawn from the bottom of the reactor 10, 11 through stripper 15. Spent catalyst is stripped with steam in the stripper 15 to vaporize the hydrocarbons remaining on the surface of the catalyst. Stripping also removes most of the hydrocarbon vapors which are entrained between the particles of catalyst, this preventing most of the hydrocarbon products from being carried to the regenerator 20 and needlessly burned to consume much of the regeneration air, and decrease the yield of useful products. The stripped catalyst from line 11 enters spent catalyst riser 27 and is picked up by a stream of air introduced via line 16 and carried via the diagonal i.e. slanting or inclined oriented catalyst riser 27, and line 28 into the regenerator 20 where the carbon is burned in a fluidized regeneration bed 25 contained in the regenerator 20 at temperatures in the range of from about 1100 to 14000F 593.3 to 760.00C by air introduced into the bed 25. Preferably, most e.g. at least 80 , preferably 80 to 97 , more preferably 90 to 95 of the air introduced into the bed 25 is supplied from a main air conduit 17, the remainder or balance of the air supplied e.g. 20 or less, preferably 3 to 20 , more preferably 5 to 10 being supplied via line 16.Entrained catalyst is again removed by staged cyclones 22, 23 and the flue gas is emitted through the stack 24.The hot, regenerated catalyst leaving the regenerator 20 via line 21 takes with it much of the heat of combustion.The heat carried over to the reactor 10 vaporizes the feed and balances the endothermic heat of cracking.Thus, the process is heat balanced. With reference to Figure 2, the regenerator 20 includes a hollow regenerator vessel, the upper portion of which is provided with a pair of staged cyclones 22, 23 and flue gas outlet 24. The lower portion of the regenerator vessel contains, or can contain, a dense phase fluidized bed of catalyst 25 which is supported atop a perforated grid 26. The catalyst in reactor 10 is gradually deactivated by the formation of coke on the catalyst. To maintain catalyst activity, catalyst is transported from the reactor 10 via line 11 to said regenerator 20 wherein coke is burned from the coked catalyst and reactivated. Spent, coked catalyst is conveyed from the reactor 10 to the catalyst regenerator 20 by means which include a spent, coked catalyst standpipe 11 and the diagonally oriented coked catalyst riser 27 operatively communicating with said Spent, coked catalyst standpipe 11.Air is injected via line 16 into the coked catalyst riser 27 to transport said catalyst, and introduce at least a portion of the air requirements, or an excess of air into said dense phase fluidized catalyst bed 25 of the spent, coked catalyst regenerator 20 for regeneration of the catalyst.The regenerator 20 also includes a vertically oriented regenerated catalyst standpipe outlet 31 for recycle of regenerated catalyst via line 21 and a regenerated catalyst riser 29 Figure 1 to the reactor 10. The improvements which constitute key and novel features of the present invention are best described by continued reference to Figure 2, and by further reference to Figure 3. These improvements include a conduit 11 communicating with said spent, coked catalyst riser 27, which extends via members 27, 28 into the lower end of said regeneration vessel 20.The wall of member 28 surrounds said regenerated catalyst standpipe outlet 31 and forms an annulus, or annular zone through which spent, coked catalyst and air can be passed into the dense phase fluidized bed 25 of said regenerator vessel 20. This combination also includes a radial distributor plate or baffle 32 located within said regenerator vessel 20 adjacent to the terminal end of said annulus, the distributor plate 32 lying within the path of the spent, coked catalyst and transporting air entering into the regenerator 20 and against which the spent, coked catalyst and air are impinged and substantially uniformly dispersed outwardly within the dense phase fluidized bed 25 of the regenerator vessel 20. Preferably, the lower face of the distributor plate 32 is notched.Disc and doughnut distributors or gas distributors 33, 34 are circumferentially dispersed about the inside wall of the conduit and along the outside wall of said regenerated catalyst standpipe outlet forming said annulus to aid in creating a more uniform flow of air and catalyst into the dense phase fluidized bed 25 of said regenerator 20. The spent, coked catalyst riser 27 which conveys catalyst from said reactor 10 to said regenerator 20, it will be observed, is diagonally disposed or inclined relative to the horizontal, the segment of the conduit 28 which forms the annulus about said regenerated catalyst standpipe outlet 31 is vertically oriented, the portion of the regenerated catalyst standpipe outlet about which said conduit is disposed is likewise vertically oriented, and the deflector plate 32 is located upon the outer wall of the regenerated catalyst standpipe outlet 31 above and preferably adjacent to the annul us at the location wherein the spent, coked catalyst riser is operatively communicated with said conduit. The annular inlet, it will be observed, empties into the very bottom of the dense phase fluidized bed. This is so that the coke begins to burn from the coked catalyst near the bottom of the bed. Consequently, the catalyst near the top of the dense phase fluidized bed will be of low carbon level, and hydrocarbons that enter with the coked catalyst will be consumed at the bottom of the bed, hence, any combus table material leaving the top of the bed will be burned by the oxygen leaving the bed down to a very low carbon monoxide level. It is apparent that various modifications and changes can be made without departing the spirit and scope of the invention. In this patent specification, the following conversions of units apply Temperatures expressed in OF are converted to OC by subtracting 32 and then dividing by 1.8. Velocities expressed in feet per second ft sec are converted to m s by multiplying by 0.3048. Masses expressed in tons are converted to tonnes 1 x 103 kg by multiplying by 1.016.
