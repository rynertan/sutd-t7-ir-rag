# Method and apparatus for determining the state of charge of a battery.

## Abstract
A method of determining the state of charge of a motor vehicle battery 1 in which a stabilization load 2 is applied to the battery 1 after the engine is switched off to accelerate the stabilization of the charge distribution within the battery 1 . The stabilization load 2 is applied until the terminal voltage of the battery 1 reaches a level corresponding to a predicted value of the state of charge of the battery 1 . After a pre determined delay of 8 hours or less, the terminal voltage of the battery 1 is measured and the state of charge derived therefrom.
