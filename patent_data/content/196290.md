## Abstract
Substantially pure antigenic surface proteins of Anaplasma marginale have been identified, and are capable of inducing immune responses in ruminants which neutralizes virulent Anaplasma marginale. The antigenic surface proteins have one or more components having a molecular weight of about 105,000 daltons, 86,000 daltons, 61,000 daltons, 36,000 daltons, 31,000 daltons, or 15,000 daltons, and can be purified by an immunoaffinity chromatography process comprising the steps of disrupting Anaplasma marginale initial bodies by treatment with a detergent, passing the disrupted initial bodies over a chromatography column comprising an insoluble matrix coupled to monoclonal antibodies against a determinant on said antigenic surface protein to selectively bind said antigenic surface protein to said monoclonal antibodies and recovering the bound substantially pure antigenic surface protein from said insoluble matrix. The antigens have further utility in diagnostic tests for anaplasmosis. They can be synthesized by polypeptide procedures or by genetic engineering.

## Description
ANAPLASMA MARGINALE SUBUNIT ANTIGEN FOR VACCINATION AND DIAGNOSISFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to proteins which can be used as antigens in a vaccine to immunize ruminants against challenge with AnaPlasma marqinale or can be used as antigens for diagnosing anaplasmosisBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Anaplasmosis is an arthropod borne homeparasitic disease of cattle and other ruminants caused by a rickettsia Anatlasma marainale A. marginale . The disease occurs worldwide and severely constrains livestock production in tropical and subtropical regions.The rickettsia is transmitted by ticks, biting flies, and blood contaminated fomites to susceptible animals.where it infects erythrocytes. The intraerythrocytic initial body a single A. marginale organism in the mature infective stage reproduces by binary fission to form two to eight initial bodies which are subsequently released to infect additional erythrocytes. During acute infection the parasitemia increases geometrically and severe extravascular anemia occurs. Marked weigh loss, abortion, and death can occur during the acute crisis. Animals that recover from the acute infection remain persistently infected and are a reservoir for transmission to susceptible animals. Current immunoprophylaxis for anaplasmosis includes premunization with a less virulent A. marginale isolate or A. centrale, a less virulent anaplasma species ,followed by tetracycline treatment to control severe infection in some animals, and vaccination with a killed whole organism preparation contaminated with host erythrocyte stroma. Premunition is successful in controlling severe clinical disease when cattle are challenged with a virulent isolate. However, clinical disease including weight loss, abortion and occasionally death may result from premunizing inoculum. This inoculum may also transmit other hemoparasites Babesia, Theileria, Tryanosoma and viruses bovine leukemia virus to the host.Challenge of cattle immunized with the killed A. marqinale erythrocyte stroma vaccine results in mild clinical disease and persistent infection. In addition, the presence of erythrocyte stroma in the vaccine has been shown to induce anti erythrocyte antibodies that when colostrally transferred cause neonatal isoerythrolysis in nursing calves.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to overcome some of the known disadvantages of prior art vac cines and diagnostic tests. This is accomplished by isolating one or more substantially pure antigenic surface proteins from A. marfinale which are capable of inducing an immune response in ruminants. One specific antigenic protein which has been isolated is a protein which has a molecular weight of about 105,000 daltons. This particular protein will be referred to hereafter as Am 105. Other antigenic proteins which have been identified to date have molecular weights of about 80,000 daltons. AM 86 , 61,000 daltons AM 61 , 36,000 daltons Am 36 , and 15,000 daltons AM 15 . The antigen might also comprise an active agent of one or more such proteins, or an immunologically similar protein produced by polypeptide synthesis or genetic engineering. The substantially pure antigenic surface protein is isolated by purifying A. marginal initial bodies, disrupting the purified A. marqinale initial bodies by use of a detergent, passing the disrupted A. marginale initial bodies through an insoluble matrix. such as an affinity chromatography column, coupled to monoclonal antibodies specific to the protein or which recognize one or more epitopes on the protein to adsorb it onto the insoluble matrix, washing the non adsorbed materials through the affinity chromatography column, and recovering the substantially pure protein from the insoluble matrix. The monoclonal antibodies are prepared by vaccinating mice with bovine erythrocytes infected with A. marginal, obtaining lymphocytes from the spleen of infected mice, and fusing the lymphocytes with myeloma cells to produce hybridomas which produce monoclonal antibodies to A. marginal antigens. The hybridomas are then initially screened for anti A. marginale antibody by indirect immunofluorescence on smears of A. marginale infected blood. The hybridomas are then further screened for monoclonal antibody against the protein by immunoprecipitation of the protein which reacts with the monoclonal antibody and subsequent determination of the molecular weight of the precipitated protein by gel electrophoresis. Additional monoclonal antibody to the selected protein from the desired hybridomas is produced by collection of ascitic fluid from mice bearing the hybridoma and the collected monoclonal antibody is purified by precipitation, dialysis and chromatography. The purified monoclonal antibody is then coupled to an insoluble matrix such as Sepharose to prepare an immunoaffinity matrix. Partially purified disrupted A.marginale initial bodies are then passed through the immunoaffinity matrix and the selected protein is selectively absorbed onto the matrix. The purified protein which has absorbed onto the matrix is then recovered from the matrix. The degree of purity of the protein achieved in accordance with the present invention is much higher than the purity of the surface antigen in its natural state. As an example, in its natural state AM 105 is believed to be present in an amount of about 0.1 to 1 of the total protein present in the initial bodies. In its natural state, many other impurities such as about 200 other proteins, carbohydrates, red cells, glycoproteins, and nucleic acid are present However, the AM 105 can be purified to a purity of at least 90 weight percent, preferably at least 95 weight percent and most preferably at least 98 weight percent. The purified AM 105 has a molecular weight of about 105,000 daltons and is reactive with monoclonal antibodies produced by cell lines ANA 15D2 and ANA 22B1. The Am 105 is essentially free of contaminating proteins, glycoproteins, carbohydrates, red cells, glycoproteins and nucleic acids. The Am 105 is a polypeptide having a molecular weight of about 105,000 daltons. However, it is believed that an active fragment of this polypeptide may be effective in inducing immunity to A. marginale in cows. The size of the active fragment may be as small as six to twenty or possibly six to ten amino acids. The Am 105 or an active fragment thereof may be produced by immunoaffinity chromatography as will be described hereinafter, polypeptide synthesis or genetic engineering DNA cloning with protein fragment expression . The Am 105 should be present in a single dose of the vaccine in an amount of 1 200 g, preferably 5 100 g, and most preferably 10 25 g. A single injectable dose will usually have a volume of about 1 ml. There fore, the concentration of purified surface antigen in an injectable vaccine composition will usually be in the range of from about 1 to about 200 g ml and preferably about 5 to about 100 g ml and most preferably 10 25 g ml. The Am 105 will usually be dissolved in an adjuvant such as Freund s incomplete adjuvant. The vaccine, in addition to containing the substantially pure surface antigen and optionally an adjuvant, may also contain any other pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent is a compound, composition or solvent which is preferably a non toxic sterile liquid. In order to immunize ruminants, young animals are inoculated with a vaccine comprising the substantially pure antigenic surface, an active fragment thereof, or an immunologically similar protein produced by polypeptide synthesis or genetic engineering is added to a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Preferably, the animals are successively inoculated with a single dose as defined above at one to six week intervals, preferably two to four weeks intervals about two to eight times, preferably three to five times. The substantially pure protein should be present in the vaccine in an amount effective to induce an immune response in the calves to Anaplasma marginale whereby when the animals are subsequently challenged with virulentA. marinale, the degree of acute infection is substantially reduced or even prevented.Injection will usually be performed intramuscularly i.m. or subcutaneously s.c. . The isolated protein, an active fragment thereof, or an immunologically similar protein produced by polypeptide synthesis or genetic engineering can also be used as the basis of diagnostic tests, such as an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay for serologic diagnosis of anaplasmosis. When blood samples from suspected animals are tested using such antigens , results distinguishing infected and non infected animals are obtainable.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONA. Preparation of Monoclonal Antibodies to A. marqi nale. The source of antigen, mouse immunization protocol, myeloma cell lines used, culture media and conditions, and cell fusion and cloning are described inDavis et al., Development of monoclonal antibodies toAnaplasma marginale and preliminary studies on their application. Proc. Seventh National Anaplasmosis Conf.Oct. 21 23, 1981, Mississippi State University Press.The procedure can be summarized as follows. Animals Young Hereford and Holstein cattle were used.Animals to be infected with A. marginal were splenectomized. Two inbred strains of mice, BALBIc andB10.A 3r , were used as a source of cells to make hybridomas. These and additional strains, B10.A, BlO.A 5R and B10.A 2R , were used as a source of thymocytes for co culture as feeder cells with hybridoma cells. Preparation of A. marginale infected erythrocytes Splenectomized cattle were infected with an Idaho isolate of A. marginale as described in Davis, W.C. et al., Infect. Immun. 22 597 602 1978 . For tissue culture studies, blood was collected in heparin every two to four days after infection. Blood smears were made and stained with Wright s Giemsa stain and examined for anaplasma bodies. When parasitemia reached 20 50 , blood was collected, centrifuged, freed of the buffy coat and then frozen in 30 dimethylsulfoxide DMSO for later use. Additional blood smears were prepared and frozen at 700C until used to detect monoclonal antibodies. Preparation of antigen and immunization Two types of preparations were used as a source of antigen. In the first, frozen cells 50 packed cell volume with a parasitemic of 30 were thawed and them immediately lysed with Tris 0.01M ammonium chloride 0.87 solution pH 7.2 . The lysate was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 30 minutes the pellet was washed 3 times in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution HBSS and resuspended in 10 ml of HBSS. Six mice B10.A 3R J were injected intraperitoneally i.p. with 1 ml of lysate.Three days before the spleens were taken for cell fusion, the mice were given an intravenous booster injection of 0.2 ml of lysate. The second preparation, a lysate of infected erythrocytes, was purified on aRenografin density gradient 25 55 as described inDavis, N.C. et al., Infec. Immun. 22 597 602 1978 .The bands containing anaplasma bodies and contaminating erythrocyte stroma were collected and washed, as described above, then resuspended in 10 ml of HBSS. Five BALBIc mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml for primary immunization and intravenously with 0.2 ml for booster immunization as described. All mice were immunized at least three weeks before receiving a booster injection. Myeloma cell lines used to produce hybridomas Several HAT hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine sensitive, tissue culture adapted mouse myeloma cell lines were used as fusion partners in the production of antibody producing hybridomas. NS1, a cell line that produces, but does not secrete K light chains, Oi et al., V.T., In Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology Eds. B.B. Mishell and SM Shiigi, WH Freeman and Co., pp 351 372 1980 and SP2 O Agl4, a cell line derived from a NS1 BALB c hybrid that synthesizes neither light or heavy chains, Schulman, M. et al., Nature, 276 279 1978 were obtained from the Salk Institute. X63Ag8.653, another cell line that does not produce light or heavy chains, Kearney, J.F. et al., J. Immunol 123 1548 1550 1979 was provided by M.Lostrum from theFred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA. Culture media and culture conditions Dulbecco sModified Eagle Medium DMEM , containing 13 fetal calf 5 serum FCS , 5 x 10 M 2 mercaptoethanol 2ME , penicillin 100 units ml and streptomycin 100 mg ml , was the primary culture medium for maintaining the myeloma cell lines and new hybridoma cell lines. Glutamine 2 mM was added when the medium was used 14 days after preparation. Fusion and transfer media were prepared by adding HAT and HT hypoxanthine and thymidine , respectively, according to the method of Littlefield, Monoclonal Antibodies Hybridomas A New Dimension of Biological Analysis Eds. Kennett, R.H. et al., Plenum Press, pp. 363 416 1981 . RPMI 1640 containing 15 FCS and penicillin streptomycin was used to culture anaplasma infected erythrocytes, Davis W.C. et al., Infect. Immun. 22 597 602 1978 . All cultures were maintained in a 5 C02 gas air mixture at 370C. Cell fusion and cloning Methods for fusing spleen and myeloma cells were similar to those described by Oi et al., supra. Myeloma cells were maintained in log phase of growth in T75 flasks by removing excess cells and feeding every 3 to 4 days. The day before fusing. cells were collected, washed by centrifugation 7 and plated in T75 flasks at 1 x 10 cells per flask.On the day of use, cells were collected, centrifuged and resuspended in DMEM without FCS. Mice are immunized by injecting disrupted bovine erythrocytes which contain A. marginale initial bodies. Spleen cells were obtained from the freshly killed, immunized mice by injecting the spleen with DMEM, gently tearing it apart with tweezers and then pressing it through a 100 mesh screen into a 50 ml test tube. Following removal of particulate debris, the cells were centrifuged into a pellet and the medium removed. Contaminating mouse erythrocytes were selectively lysed by brief exposure to distilled water 2 ml and the spleen cells were then quickly diluted in DMEM. Thymocytes to be used as feeder were collected as above but without water 7 lysis and suspended in DMEM FCS HAT at 1 x 10 cells per ml.Myeloma cells and spleen cells were counted, then mixed either at a ratio of 5 or 2.5 spleen cells 8 to 1 myeloma cell. Usually, 10 spleen cells were 7 mixed with 2 or 4 x 10 myeloma cells. The cell mixture was sedimented and the supernatant removed. One ml of a 50 solution of polyethylene glycol PEG 1540,Baker Chemical Co. was then placed over the cell pellet and slowly mixed with the cells so as to form a 3 slurry of small 1 mm clumps of cells. Following 3 minutes of mixing, the cells were slowly diluted by adding 10 ml DMEM in 10 minutes and 20 ml over the next 5 minutes. The resultant mixture of fused cells was centrifuged into a pellet and the cells were resuspended in DMEM FCS HAT. Thymocytes were then added to 8 give a mixture containing 10 spleen cells. tumor cells and 1 x 10 thymocytes.Cells were distributed in ten 96 well culture plates and placed in the incubator. One half the tissue culture medium was replaced every 3 to 4 days. When clones of hybridomas were 300 1000 cells in size usually by 12 18 days , the supernatants were collected and tested by indirect immunofluorescence on smears of infected erythrocytes.Cells from positive wells were identified and transferred to 24 well 2 ml culture plates. Three to 5 x 6 10 thymocytes were added as feeder cells to support growth. At 14 days or when the cultures needed to be thinned, the medium was replaced with DMEM FCS HT. The cells were maintained in static cultures 1 week inDMEM FCS HT then on DMEM FCS for two weeks by removing excess cells and feeding every 2 4 days, depending on the rate of replication of individual clones. At this time, a duplicate plate was prepared and allowed to overgrow. The supernatants from this plate were tested for antibody activity. All cell lines identified as antibody producers by this procedure were then taken from the master plate and expanded into 6 well plates 5 ml capacity in each well as single cultures, 3 wells per cell line.Cells were collected twice and 6 frozen 3 10 x 10 cells in 10 DMSO in liquid nitrogen. The remaining cells were allowed to proliferate and die. The supernatants were then collected approximately 15 ml and frozen for subsequent analy 515. When cell lines producing antibody of immediate interest were identified, they were taken from the freezer, thawed and cloned by limiting dilution immediately or following 24 hrs. culture. Usually, hybridoma cells were plated in 2 to 6 96 well plates, 3 cells per well in the presence of 106 thymocytes.Wells containing single colonies were identified microscopically and supernatants were collected and tested for antibody activity. Cells from positive wells were transferred as above to 24 well plates and then to 6 well plates for colony expansion and preservation. Four to 6 cloned lines were preserved for each line. In preliminary studies several methods of preparing hybridomas were compared to determine the optimal conditions for use of monoclonal antibody technology in the study of A. marginal. The results obtained revealed that SP2 0 AG 14 and X63 Ag8.653 myeloma cells were the most useful fusion partners because of their growth characteristics, the efficiency of outgrowth of hybridomas, and their inability to secrete light or heavy chains. The fusion ratios found to be the most effective were 5 to 1 for SP2 0 Agl4 and 2.5 to 1 for X63Ag8.653. Under the culture conditions employed, it was essential to have 2 ME in the culture medium and thymocytes as feeder cells. When these measures were disregarded, outgrowth of the hybridomas was unpredictable however. when the measures described were taken, 600 to 1000 hybrids were obtained per fusion. The use of erythrocyte contaminated preparations of A. marginale as antigen presented no problems. Both the crude lysate and renografin purified preparations were highly immunogenic. The majority of the hybrids detected in primary culture produced antibody to A.marginale. More anti erythrocyte antibody producing hybrids were seen when the lysate was used as a source of antigen, however. When a sufficient number of hybridomas were collected and preserved, they were tested by immunodiffusion to determine the class of antibody being produced. In addition, they were tested by indirect immunofluorescence on smears of infected erythrocytes to determine their patterns of binding to A. marginale or erythrocytes, on cultures of infected monocytes grown in short term culture and on acetone fixed sections of tissue taken from infected cattle.B. Selection of Cell Lines Producing Anti Am 105 Monoclonal Antibodies. The hybridoma cell supernatants are initially screened for anti A. marginale antibody by indirect immunofluorescence on acetone fixed smears of A. marqinale infected blood. The positive antibody producing cell lines are then further screened for specific production of anti Am 105 antibodies using immunoprecipi 35 tation of either E SI methionine radio labeled or 125 1 13 surface radiolabeled A. marginal. The exact procedure for this, which is a slight modification of the procedure reported by Palmer, G.H, et al., J. Immunology, 133 1010 1984 , is as follows. The immunoprecipitation of surface radioiodinated initial bodies and erythrocyte stroma was performed by using a modification of the technique described by Shapiro, S.Z. et al., J. Tmmunol. Methods, 13 153 1976 . The initial bodies or erythrocytes were disrupted with 1 v v Nonident P 40 and 0.1 wZv SDS at 4 C for 30 min, centrifuged at 135,000 x G for 60 min, passed through a 0.2 m filter Uillipore Corp., Bedford, MA , and sonicated for 15 sec at 50 W. Two hundred thousand trichloroacetic acid precipitable cpm were added to 50 ml hybridoma supernatant followed by 10 ml rabbit anti mouse immunoglobulin in siliconized tubes and were incubated at 40C for 30 min. One hundred microliters of 10 v v protein A bearing Staphylococcus aureus Calbiochem Behring Corp., La Jolla, CA were added to each tube, incubated for 30 min at 4 C, and washed six times with Ten buffer 20 mM Tris HCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1 M Nail, 15 mM NaN3, pH 7.6 containing 0.1 Nonident P 40, and for the first four washes 2 M NaCl, by using centrifugation at 1250 X G. The precipitated label was eluted by boiling the staphylococci bound complexes for 3 min in 50 ml SDS PAGE buffer and centrifuging at 1000 x G. The immunoprecipitates 2000 to 10,000 cpm and the radioiodinated initial bodies and erythrocytes 200,000 cpm were electrophoresed on 7.5 to 17.5 w v gradient polyacrylamide gels. The gels were fixed in glassdistilled water methanol acetic acid 6 4 1 , were dried, and were exposed to Kodak X OmatAR film Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY at room temperature for 48 hr to identify the radioiodinated initial body and erythrocyte polypeptides, and at 700C by using Cronex Quanta III intensifying screens DuPong,Wilmington, DE for 72 hr to identify the immunopreci pitates. 14C Labeled proteins used for m.w. comparison Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL consisted of myosin, 200,000 mw. phosphorylase b, 92,500 bovine serum albumin, 69,000 ovalbumin, 46,000 carbonic anhydrase, 30,000 and lysozyme, 14,300. If the hybridoma supernatant contained monoclonal antibodies to Am 105, a band on the X ray film autoradiograph is observed at a molecular weight of about 105,000. Two cell lines ANA 15D2 and ANA 22B1 were identified that produced anti Am 105 antibodies. The cell lines were double cloned and the supernatants concentrated to 0.1 mg immunoglobulin ml following determination of isotype both were IgG3 . The concentrated supernatants were used for all further testing. The immunoprecipitation of 125I Am 105 was repeated with the double cloned hybridoma supernatants. The evidence that Am 105 is an initial body protein and not of erythrocyte origin includes unreactivity of ANA 15D2, ANA 22B1, or rabbit anti Am 105 antibodies all positive on initial bodies in infected erythrocytes with uninfected erythrocytes or infected erythrocyte membranes using immunofluorescence, and failure of these antibo 125 dies to immunoprecipitate I radiolabelled erythro cyte ghosts.Additionally, ANA 15D2 and ANA 22B1 immunoprecipitate Am 105 metabolically radiolabelled in vitro during short term erythrocyte culture. It has 35 been demonstrated that during short term cultures S incorporation occurs exclusively in initial bodies. Am 105 is immunoprecipitated as a doublet band seen most 35 clearly with S labelled Am 105 or silver stained Am 105. The doublet is consistently present and most likely represents differences in post translational modification. In order to test for initial body neutralization using the two anti Am 105 monoclonal antibodies, 10 initial bodies were incubated with pooled ANA 15D2 andANA 22B1 ascitic fluid, and the mixture was injected into splenectomized calves. Although complete neutralization was not observed, a significant prolongation of the prepatent period occurred Table 1 . The experiment was repeated with the assumption that the prolonged prepatent period observed with 1010 initial bodies indicated partial neutralization and that complete neutralization would likely occur at a lower infective dose. In the second experiment complete neutralization of initial body infectivity occurred using 7 10 initlial bodies and partial neutralization as judged by prolonged prepatent periods occurred using 10 , 10 , and 10 initial bodies. The mechanism of neutralization by the anti Am 105 monoclonal antibodies is unknown at present. Certainly monoclonal antibodies directed against an initial body determinant necessary for erythrocyte receptor binding would neutralize infectivity. ANA 15D2 and ANA 22B1 may recognize the same or overlapping determinants as they reciprocally inhibit binding of each other to 125, Am 105 in a competition radioimmunoassay. Other modes of neutralization include agglutination and when possible across murine bovine species lines, interaction with bovine effector cells and complement fixation with initial body lysis. The effective use of AM 105 as a protective immunogen to prevent bovine anaplasmosis would require that the determinants recognized by the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies be common to all isolates in a given region. Both similarities and differences in protein and antigenic composition among various isolates of A. marginal have been demonstrated. Six isolates from widely geographically separated areas of the U.S. Florida Okanogan, Washington South Idaho North Texas Clarkston, Washington Virginia have been examined for the presence of determinants recognized by ANA 15D2 andANA 22B1 using indirect immunofluorescence on acetone fixed blood smears. The determinants were present on 100 of the initial bodies as determined by comparison with Wright s stained initial bodies in an adjacent section of the smear in all six isolates. Additionally. the determinants were present at all stages of a primary, acute infection from 1 parasitemia through peak parasitemia with hemolytic crisis.The presence of these determinants now identified as protective antigens on multiple isolates and their presence at all stages of infection fulfill important criteria for use of Am 105 or its fragments as a vaccine. Am 105 and Am 105 polypeptides containing determinants recognized by the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been tested as effective immunoprophylaxis for bovine anaplasmosis. A. Partial neutralization of infectivity of 10 A. marinale initial bodies of monoclonal antibodies ANA 15D2 22B1 . BALBIc X B1OA 3r mice were injected intraperitoneally i.p. with 1.0 ml Pristane and one week later with with 2 3 X 10 double cloned hybridoma cells suspected of producing anti Am 105 antibodies. Ten days after injection with the hybridoma cells, ascitic fluid was withdrawn from the mice, centrifuged to pellet debris, and passed over a glass wool column. The indirect fluorescent antibody IFA titer is determined. A strong titer would be 1 16,000. 1010 initial bodies are purified from A. marginale Florida isolate infected erythrocytes as described in Palmer, G.H. et al.,J.Immunology, 133 1010 1984 and resuspended in 2.5 ml RPMI 1640 2SM L Glutamine, 25mM HEPER The initial bodies are added to 2.5 ml of ascitic fluid. The initial body ascitic fluid suspension is briefly vortexed, incubated for 45 min. at room temperature, and injected into the left semitendinosus muscle of each calf. Daily blood samples are collected for 75 days post inoculation DPI to determine packed cell volume PCV and parasitemia 1000 erythrocytes counted . Probability values p are calculated using the pooled t test p values of less than 0.05 are considered significant. NS, not significant. ND, significance not determined. The results of a test using two cell lines designated ANA 15D2 and ANA 22B1 which produce monoclonal antibodies to Am 105 and a cell line TRYP lEl which produced monoclonal anti bodies against Trvpanosoma brucei are reported in Table I.

Neutralization of infectivity of graded numbers of initial bodies by monoclonal antibodies ANA 15D2 22B1 The experiment was repeated with the hypothesis that the prolonged prepatent period observed with 10 initial bodies indicated a partial neutralization and that complete neutralization would likely occur at a lower infective dose. The protocol used was similar to that described inPart a. A constant amount of ascitic fluid was inoculated with either 10 , 10 , 10 , or 10 purified A. marqinale Florida isolate initial bodies, injected into calves, and infection monitored as previously described.

Purification of Monoclonal Antibodies. The steps for purifying the monoclonal antibodies to couple to the immunoadsorbent column are 1. BALB c X B10 A 3r mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1.0 ml Pristane Aldrich Chemical Co., 6Milwaukee, WI and one week later with 2 3 X 10 dou ble cloned hybridoma cells. Ten days later, ascitic fluid was withdrawn from the mice, centrifuged at 1,675X G to pellet insoluble debris and passed over a glass wool column.2. A 50 v v NH4SO4 precipitation is conducted on the wool column effluent and following resuspension in .032M Tris is dialyzed for 24 hrs. against .032 MTris. This dialyzed sample is chromatographed on aDE 52 cellulose column and eluted using a 0 0.2M NaCl continuous gradient in .032M Tris. The eluted fractions are titered using indirect immunofluorescence on acetone fixed smears of A. marinale infected blood.The purity of the antibody is determined using sodium dodecyl suLfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE with detection of protein using CoomassieBlue staining. D. Preparation of the Monoclonal Immunoaffinity Chro matography Column.1. The purified monoclonal antibody, ANA 15D2 pure by Coomassie Blue staining on SDS PAGE is dialized against 0.1M Narc03, 0.5 M NaCl pH 8.3. The dialyzed protein is coupled to CNBr activated Sepharose 4B Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, N.J. at 10 mg protein ml settled Sepharose 4B overnight at 40C rotation. The coupled immunoaffinity matrix ANA 15DZ Seph 4B is poured into an Econo column 11.5 ml column Bio Rad Lab., Richmond, CA and stored at 40C until use. E. Source of the A. marqinale Initial Bodies. A. marginale has never been successfully grown in longterm in vitro culture. The source of A. marqinale therefore is blood of infected, splenectomized calves. 10The calves are inoculated with 10 initial bodies intramuscularly and then checked daily for evidence of parasitemia using Wright s stained blood smears. When the percentage of infected erythrocytes reaches 40 95 , 4 7 liters of blood are collected into 4 units ml heparin sulfate. The erythrocytes are washed 3X with phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2 and the resuspended 1 1 in 31.2 dimethylsulfoxide in phosphate buffered saline. This suspension is frozen in liquid nitrogen and constitutes the A. marginale initial body source.F. Disruption and Treatment of A. marainale Initial Bodies. The A. marginale infected erythrocytes 10 will yield approx. 1.0 mg pure Am 105 are thawed from liquid nitrogen at 37 C and washed 5X in phosphate buffered saline using centrifugation at 27,000 X G. The sediment is resuspended in 35 ml phosphate buffered saline, disrupted by 2 min. of sonication at 50 watts 127 X 4 mm titanium probe, Braun sonic 1510, BraunInstruments, San Francisco, CA and then washed two times at 1650 X G for 15 min. The purified initial bodies are disrupted in 5 ml 50mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 1.0 Nonident P40, 0.1 sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5mMEDTA, 5mM iodoacetamide, lmM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 0.1 mM tosyl L lysyl chloromethane and applied to the ANA 15D2 Sepharose 4B monoclonal immunoaffinity column. G. Column Chromatography. The ANA 15D2 Sepharose 4B monoclonal immunoaffinity column is washed with 100 X column volume with TEN buffer 20mM Tris HCl, 5mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCl, 25mMNaN3, pH 7.6 1 NP 40, 0.1 SDS and the approxima 1012 tely 1012 disrupted initial bodies are loaded onto the column at a rate of 25 ml hr. The unbound proteins are washed out using 100 X column volume TEN with 1.0 NP 40 and 0.1 SDS and then any remaining unbound proteins and the NP 40, SDS non dialyzable detergents are removed by 100 X column volumes TEN without detergent. The specifically bound Am 105 is eluted using 50mM Tris pH 8.0 with 0.5 deoxycholate and 2M KSCN.H. Recovery of Purified Surface Antigen. The eluted protein Am 105 is dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline to remove the KSCN and deoxycholate. Am 105 is quantitated using a modified Lowry protein assay and frozen at 700C until use.I. Preparation of Vaccine. Am 105 is thawed and suspended in Freund s incomplete adjuvant to produce a vaccine in which substantially pure Am 105 is present in an amount of 10, 25 or 100 mg ml.J. Immunization Studies. Groups comprised of 5 Holstein calves, weighing approximately 100 kg, were immunized 4 times with 100 mg of either ovalbumin emulsified in Freund s complete adjuvant group 1 , Am 105 emulsified in Freund s incomplete adjuvant group 2 , or Am 36 emulsified inFreund s incomplete adjuvant group 3 . The immunizations were conducted on day 1, day 17, day 35 and day 59. Group 4, which consisted of 4 calves, was not immunized. The antibody response of the 4 groups to Am 105 was determined using a radioimmunoassay based on 1251 Am 105. The calves were challenged on day 83 with 108 purified Florida isolate A. marqinale initial bodies.The calves were monitored for infection by daily clinical examination, determination of hematocrit, and examination of Wright s stained blood smears for presence of parasites.The results are presented in Table III.

The significant elongation of the prepatent period days until infection was detected , significant reduction in parasitemia, significant difference in PCV, and complete protection in 2 of 5 Am 105 vaccinates relative to calves immunized with ovalbumin indicates thatAm 105 is capable of inducing significant protection against challenge with A. marqinale.K. General Discussion. The six major A. marginale initial body surface proteins identified to date Am 105, Am 86, Am 61, Am 36, Am 31, Am 15 each have a surface location on the initial body. Evidence for the surface nature of Am 105, Am 86, Am 61, Am 36, Am 31, and Am 15 proteins was obtained by radioiodination of the proteins on intact initial bodies using a membrane impermeant radiolabeling technique lactoperoxidase Palmer, GH, McGuireTC J. Immunol. 133 1010 1015, 1984 . A. marqinale initial bodies were purified from parasitized erythrocytes by using ultrasonic disruption and differential centrifugation. The initial bodies were intact as determined by electron microscopy, were not agglutinated by anti bovine erythrocyte sera and were infective.Nine initial body proteins were surface radioiodinated using lactoperoxidase Am 220, Am 105, Am 86,Am 61, Am 56, Am 42, Am 36, Am 31 and Am 25 and five Am 105, Am 86, Am 61, Am 36 and Am 31 were precipitated by neutralizing antibody. The latter five proteins are major surface proteins and one or more of these proteins alone or in combination might be incorporated in a vaccine or diagnostic test. In fact, the date presented in Table III shows that either purified Am 105 or Am 36 will induce protective immunity against virulent A. marpinale challenge in calves.That purified proteins will work as vaccines indicates that similar results might be achieved with synthetic peptides of 6 amino acids or more mimicking the antigenic structure of the biologically active epitopes, with antigens expressed in heterologous bacteria containing the genes coding for the biologically active epitopes of the surface proteins or with one or more antigens expressed in virus vectors containing the genes coding for biologically active epitopes of the surface proteins. The five major A. marginale initial body surface proteins Am 105, Am 86, Am 61, Am 36 and Am 31 bear epitopes recognized by neutralizing antibody. Antiserum prepared by immunization of rabbits with purifiedA. marginale initial bodies completely neutralized the 10 infectivity of 10 purified initial bodies for splenectomized cattle. Using the technique of immunoprecipitation these five proteins were recognized by the neutralizing antibody, demonstrating their potential roles, either individually or in combination, in inducing neutralizing antibody and therefore their use as an improved vaccine for cattle. The recognition of these 5 surface proteins was consistent regardless of the isolate Florida, Washington O, Virginia of A.marginale used to immunize the rabbits to prepare the antiserum. It has been shown that Am 105 and Am 36 each bear an epitope common among all A. marginale isolates tested Florida, Washington O, Washington C, Virginia, N.Texas, S. Idaho, Kansas, Oklahoma, Kapiti Kenya , andIsrael round and Israel tails and to A. centrale a less virulent species that are capable of inducing neutralizing antibody. The purification of Am 105 orAm 36 by monoclonal antibody immunoaffinity chromatography and the demonstration of its ability to induce protection in cattle immunized with the protein clearly shows their importance, either alone or in combination with other surface proteins, as an improved vaccine against anaplasmosis. These Am 105 or Am 36 epitopes are completely protease sensitive and do not bear any carbohydrate residues and as such can be easily mimicked by short minimum 6 amino acids synthetic peptides or by polypeptides expressed in a foreign bacterium or virus containing the gene coding for the epitopes.The availability of the monoclonal antibody makes both the synthetic peptide and the gene cloning procedures alternative approaches to vaccine development. The six surface proteins Am 105, Am 86, Am 61, Am 36, Am 31, Am 15 identified to date are specifically recognized by serum taken from cattle over a period of 30 days to 255 days post infection. This recognition is consistent regardless of the isolate used to infect the cattle Florida, Virginia, N. Texas . This specific recognition is required for selection of A. marqi nale proteins to be used individually or in combination as the antigen in an improved serologic assay to diagnose anaplasmosis in cattle. These supporting data point to use of these proteins for diagnosing anaplasmosis. The isolation and incorporation of these proteins into a serologic assay for diagnosis is a straightforward technical procedure. The findings to date also indicate potential use of a synthetic peptide of 6 amino acids or more or a polypeptide expressed in a vector organism as immunologically equivalent agents for diagnostic purposes. Am 105 and Am 36, isolated by monoclonal immunoaffinity chromatography and coated into wells of a microtiter plate at 5 to 100 ng well, have been tested as the basis of an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay ELISA for serologic diagnosis of anaplasmosis. Each assay has been found capable of differentiating non infected from A. marpinale or A. centrale infected cat tle at periods from 30 225 days post infection and was accurate regardless of the isolate used to infect the cattle Florida, N. Texas, Virginia, Washington O,Washington C, Idaho, Kenya, Israel round, Israeltailed . The present serologic assay is based on the isolated whole Am 105 or Am 36. These findings. however, imply the potential use of an immunologically similar synthetic peptide of six amino acids or more or a polypeptide expressed in a vector organism. Proteins of 105,000 daltons Am 105 , 86,000 daltons Am 86 , 61,000 daltons Am 61 , 31,000 daltons Am 31 and 15,000 daltons Am 15 , all identified as surface proteins, are strongly antigenic as evidenced by antibody in A. marginale infected cattle. In addition, dilutions of the post infection sera have high titers to Am 86 and Am 15 throughout infection, indicating a preferential response. Use of Am 86 alone or in combination with Am 105, Am 61, Am 31, or Am 15 as an antigen in a diagnostic test is implied from these findings. The present stage of this research also points to potential use of an immunologically similar synthetic peptide of six amino acids or more or a polypeptide expressed in a vector organism which has epitopes recognized by post infection sera as antigens in diagnostic tests for anaplasmosis. Hybridomas ANA 15D2 andANA 22B1 have been deposited in the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland, under the terms of the Budapest Treaty.
