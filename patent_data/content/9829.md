# Scan rate converter utilizing discrete differentially coded signals.

## Abstract
A scan rate converter utilizing a discrete differential cod ing system is disclosed. The scan rate converter converts input FSTV and SSTV video information into discrete diffe rentially coded signals and stores these signals in a high speed memory 158 . The stored video information is read out of the high speed memory at both a fast scan and a slow scan rate and is reconverted into respective FSTV ans SSTV output signals.
