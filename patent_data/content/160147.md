# LAMINATED IRON CORE FOR ELECTRIC MACHINE

## Abstract
A laminated iron core for an electric machine, wherein a plurality of iron core elements 1 1, 1 2, ..., 1 n , each of which being provided with half punched projections 3 , 4 of linearly symmetrical portions thereof in such a manner that the half punched projections 3 , 4 protrude in the thickness direction of the core element from front and rear surfaces thereof are divided into two, and one divided iron core elements 1 1, 1 2, ..., 1 n are reversed around a line of symmetry thereof and engaged with the other divided iron core elements 1 1, 1 2, ..., 1 n , so that each of the half punched projections 3 , 4 are fitted into corresponding half punched recess of the adjacent core element to thereby combine the core elements together.
