## Description
This invention relates to signal generator circuits. More particularly, but not exclusively, the invention relates to a signal generator circuit for generating a synchronisation signal, a display clock signal and similar signals for a television receiver employed in a character and picture image information system such as a CAPTAIN In the CAPTAIN and other videotex character and picture image information systems and in similar systems using a colour television receiver as a display apparatus, there are required signals such as vertical and horizontal synchronisation signals, a colour sub carrier signal for example, a signal having a frequency of substantially 3.58 MHz and a display clock signal for example, a signal having a frequency of substantially 5.727 MHz . When character and picture information is displayed on the screen of a television receiver, the display portion in the horizontal direction is determined with reference to the horizontal synchronisation signal that is, such information is displayed at a predetermined position time with respect to the position time of the horizontal sychronisation signal. To indicate such display position, a special pulse is generated. The position of the special pulse is determined by the operation of a counter which begins at a time which, because of deficiencies in previously proposed structures, may change by one clock period in successive horizontal lines. This of course correspondingly displaces the display position pulse so that a jitter appears in the horizontal direction in a picture reproduced on the screen of the television receiver. According to the present invention there is provided a signal generator circuit comprising A preferred signal generator circuit embodying the invention and described hereinbelow can generate a synchronisation signal for a television receiver for use with a CAPTAIN or other videotex character and picture information system and similar systems. In the preferred signal generator circuit, a display position pulse is formed at a constant position with respect to a horizontal synchronisation signal so that jitter in the horizontal direction of a picture displayed on a screen can be avoided. The preferred signal generator circuit can produce a display clock signal and a horizontal synchronisation signal having a constant phase relation therebetween such that, for example, the rising edge of the display clock signal and the rising edge of the horizontal synchronisation avoid coincidence with each. The invention will now be further described, by way of illustrative and non limiting example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like references designate like elements and parts throughout, and in which Figure 1 shows a typical previously proposed signal generator circuit for generating a colour sub carrier signal and a display clock signal for use in a television receiver forming part of a CAPTAIN or other videotex system or the like. In Figure 1, an oscillator circuit 1 generates an oscillation signal with a frequency of substantially 14.32 MHz, which is four times the desired colour sub carrier frequency of substantially 3.58 MHz. The oscillation signal is supplied to a television synchronisation signal generator circuit 2, which produces a vertical synchronization signal P The oscillation signal of 14.32 MHz from the oscillator circuit 1 is supplied also to a frequency divider 3, which divides the input frequency of 14.32 MHz by four to produce the colour sub carrier signal SC of 3.58 MHz. The colour sub carrier signal SC is utilised in a known manner by circuitry not shown. Since the horizontal synchronisation signal P The colour sub carrier signal SC of 3.58 MHz from the frequency divided 3 is supplied also to a frequency divider 4, which divides the input frequency of 3.58 MHz by five and supplies a signal having a frequency of substantially 716 KHz to a phase comparator 5. A voltage controlled oscillator VCO 6 generates a signal having a frequency of substantially 11.454 MHz. This signal is supplied to a frequency divider 7 that divides by two. An output of the divider 7 is supplied to a frequency divider 8 that divides by eight. An output of the frequency divider 8 is supplied to the phase comparator 5 in which it is compared in phase with the signal of substantially 716 KHz which results from frequency dividing the colour sub carrier signal SC of 3.58 MHz by five. An error signal from the phase comparator 5 is supplied through a low pass filter 9 to the voltage controlled oscillator 6 as a control voltage thereof. Accordingly, the voltage controlled oscillator 6 produces an oscillation signal of substantially 11.454 MHz and the frequency divider 7 produces a signal of substantially 5.727 MHz which is supplied to circuitry not shown as a display clock signal CLK. The display clock signal CLK is, of course, synchronised in phase with the colour sub carrier signal SC. The frequency 5.727 MHz of the display clock signal CLK is thus 8 5 times the frequency 3.58 MHz of the colour sub carrier signal SC. Phase synchronisation is established between the signal obtained by frequency dividing the colour sub carrier signal SC by five by means of the divider 4 and that obtained by frequency dividing the display clock signal CLK by eight by means of the divider 8 . As a result, the phase difference between the display clock signal CLK shown in line A of Figure 2 and the colour sub carrier signal SC shown in line B of Figure 2 assumes five different values at the times P₁ to P₅. Specifically, each of the times P₁ to P₅ coincides with a rising edge of the colour sub carrier signal SC, but only the time P₁ coincides with a rising edge of the display clock signal CLK the remaining times P₂ to P₅ fall varying distances between rising and falling edges of the display clock signal CLK. Since, as indicated above, the horizontal synchronisation signal P In this previously proposed signal generator circuit, the one of the times P₁ to P₅ at which the phase difference between the rising edges of the horizontal synchronisation signal P When character and picture information is displayed on the screen of a television receiver employed in a CAPTAIN or other videotex system or the like, the display position in the horizontal direction is determined with reference to the horizontal synchronisation signal P The display position pulse is generated by employing the rising edge of the horizontal synchronisation signal P However, as indicated above, there is a possibility that the phase difference between the rising edges of the horizontal synchronisation signal P Figures 3 and 4A to 4I illustrate a preferred embodiment of signal generator circuit according to the present invention which reliably prevents horizontal jitter in the display. In this signal generator circuit, the display clock signal CLK Figure 4H and the horizontal synchronisation signal P In Figure 3, parts corresponding to parts of Figure 1 are designated by the same references and are not described in detail. A television synchronisation signal generator circuit 2 has a clock input terminal CK to which an oscillation signal having a frequency of substantially 14.32 MHz is supplied from the oscillator 1. On the basis of the oscillation signal of 14.32 MHz supplied thereto, the synchronisation signal generator circuit 2 produces a vertical synchronisation signal P The oscillation signal of 14.32 MHz from the oscillator 1 is supplied also to a frequency divider 3, which divides the 14.32 MHz signal by four and produces a colour sub carrier signal SC having a frequency of substantially 3.58 MHz. The colour sub carrier signal SC is supplied to a frequency divider 4, which divides the 3.58 MHz signal by five and produces a signal having a frequency of substantially 716 KHz. The output of the frequency divider 4 is supplied to a phase comparator 5. The oscillation signal from a voltage controlled oscillator VCO 6, which forms a part of a phase locked loop PLL circuit, is supplied to a frequency divider 10. The frequency divider 10 divides the frequency of the signal from the VCO 6 by sixteen and supplies an output to the phase comparator 5. The frequency divider 10, like the other frequency dividers employed in the present signal generator circuit, may comprise a counter. The divider 10 may comprise, for example, an up mode counter for counting from 0 to 15 and producing one output pulse for every sixteen input pulses. The phase comparator 5 makes a phase comparison between the signal supplied by the divider 10 and the above mentioned signal which is generated by the frequency divider 4 when it divides the frequency of the colour sub carrier signal SC of 3.58 MHz by five. The compared error signal from the phase comparator 5 is supplied through a low pass filter LPF 9 to the VCO 6 as its control voltage so that the VCO 6 produces an oscillation signal CLK₀ shown in Figure 4A of substantially 11.454 MHz. The oscillation signal CLK₀ from the VCO 6 is supplied to a timer circuit 11. In the timer circuit 11 the oscillation signal CLK₀ supplied thereto is counted. Until the above described PLL circuit is stabilised, the timer 11 produces a low level signal 0 at its output thereafter, the timer 11 produces a high level signal 1 at its output. The output signal from the timer 11 is supplied to one input terminal of an AND gate 12. A detecting circuit 13 is provided to detect a time P₁ at which the rising edge of the colour sub carrier signal SC of 3.58 MHz shown in Figure 4C coincides with the rising edge of the oscillation signal CLK₀ of 11.454 MHz shown in Figure 4A . The detecting circuit 13 is supplied with signals corresponding to selected bits of a counter incorporated in the frequency divider 10 so that the detecting circuit 13 produces a signal S An output signal from the AND gate 12, which is produced when and only when a signal is supplied to each input terminal of the AND gate, is supplied to a J input terminal of a J K flip flop 14. The K input terminal of the flip flop 14 is grounded, and a clock input terminal CK thereof is supplied with the oscillation signal CLK₀. A power source terminal 15, to which a positive A signal S The signal S For comparison, the display clock signal CLK of Figure 1 and line A of Figure 2 is reproduced in Figure 4B. It is evident that the display clock signal CLK in Figure 4B is 180 The above described signal generator circuit embodying the invention operates as follows. When power is applied to the terminal 15, a signal which is low or 0 during a predetermined period T₀ is produced at the junction P between the resistor 16 and the capacitor 17 and supplied to the clear terminal After the phase locked loop PLL circuit including the VCO 6 stabilises, the timer circuit 11 produces an output signal which is high or 1 and which is supplied to one input terminal of the AND gate 12. During the interval from t₀ to t₁, the detecting circuit 13 produces the signal S If the above described predetermined period T₀ has elapsed, the signal S At the time t₁, the signal S Since the time t₂, when the display clock signal CLK begins, follows the time t₁, when the operation of the synchronisation signal generator 2 begins, by one cycle of the signal CLK₀ or one half cycle of the clock signal CLK, the rising edge of the horizontal synchronisation signal P The signal generator circuit embodying the invention is thus ideally suited for a television receiver for use with a CAPTAIN or other videotex character and picture information system and similar systems. A display position pulse is formed at a constant position so that jitter in the horizontal direction of a picture displayed on a screen is avoided. The signal generator circuit embodying the invention can produce a display clock signal and a horizontal synchronisation signal having a constant phase relation therebetween such that, for example, the rising edge of the display clock signal and the rising edge of the horizontal synchronisation signal are never coincident with each other. Many modifications of the preferred embodiment of the invention disclosed herein will readily occur to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the foregoing disclosure. For example, the phase relationship between the rising edge of the display clock signal CLK and the rising edge of the horizontal synchronisation signal P
