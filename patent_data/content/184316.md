# Positive correction of gravure plates.

## Abstract
Gravure printing plates are corrected by applying a physical resist, usually an elastomeric polymer composition, to the tops of the cell walls in the area to be corrected, deepening the cells in that area using a jet of abrasive particles in a fulid and then removing the resist. The jet usually comprises an abrasive in water. The process is particularly suitable for the correction of gravure plates having an epoxy resin surface.

## Description
Positive Correction of Gravure Plates A gravure printing surface consists of a large number of cells defined by cell walls and carried on a plate that may be a flat plate or a cylinder. The cells may be discrete cells or they may be grooves. For instance the cells on a gravure cylinder may be helical grooves. Various methods for making the cells are well known and include engraving by various mechanical methods or by striking the surface with a laser, ion or electron beam. Ink is spread on to the plate and a doctor blade scrapes the ink off the tops of the cell walls leaving it only in the cells. A proof sheet to be printed is laid against the plate and takes up the ink from the cells.The volume of the cells determines the amount of ink taken up and therefore the density of the printing. If the proof print is satisfactory the plate is then used for a print run. If not, the cells must be altered. For instance it is often necessary to change the density of the printing over some or all of the area of the plate. To increase the density of the printing the cells must be deepened and this is termed positive correction. Unless a very large area of the plate has to be positively corrected, it is not practicable to engrave by repeating the initial mechanical or radiation induced engraving because of the difficulties of achieving exact registration of the plate on the machine and of programming and operating the machine. Ancther method of correcting plates is by chemical etching. In this method the whole of the plate surface is coated with a chemical resist that is usually a protective ink which does not go into the cells. The ink is then dried and the area that is not to be corrected is covered by a layer of bitumen or other protective material, which enters the cells as well as providing a layer over the cell walls. The remaining parts of the plate are then swabbed with an etching solution which is maintained in the cells for as long as is necessary to give the desired correction. Then the protective coating and the resist are washed off. The method is inconvenient for feathering corrections, that is corrections where adjacent areas require to be corrected by different amounts, since the etchant must be left in contact with the cells for varying lengths of time. This is generally done by repeating the process several times but varying the area covered by the protective coating each time, thereby controlling the exposure of the cells to the etchant. A development of this process is described in EP 0031646 where the etchant is temperature sensitive. In this method the etchant etches the plate at high temperatures but not at the lower, ambient, temperatures at which the etchant is applied to the plate.Feathering corrections can easily be carried out in a one step process by applying the etchant over the whole of the area to be corrected and differentially heating those areas to obtain a feathering effect. Also the rate at which the cells are etched can be controlled easier than in earlier processes. Chemical etching methods of positive correction are suitable for metal printing plates since the etchants are not necessarily too harsh. Unfortunately printing plates made of synthetic resins tend to be chemically very inert and so the chemical etchants suitable for these have to be extremely harsh, the one most often used being 85 sulphuric acid. The normal etchants are so harsh that they generally attack the protective ink resist and even the protective coating, or, if these are inert enough to stand up to the etchant, then they are very difficult to remove when the positive correction process has been completed. In addition the chemical etchants are environmentally hazardous and corrosive, therefore difficult to use and expensive to dispose of. Accordingly at the present time there is a need for a method of positively correcting gravure plates that will give the desired properties by a quick and easy method and which uses cheap readily available materials that are not an environmental hazard and which is suitable for correction of resin plates. A process according to the invention for the positive correction of an area of a gravure plate comprises applying a physical resist to the tops of the cell walls in that area, deepening the cells in that area by abrasion with a jet of abrasive particles in a fluid and then removing the physical resist. The process of the invention may be used for plates having metal or synthetic surfaces. It has been found that the process of the invention is particularly useful for positive correction of plates having continuous resin surfaces, which have a very high chemical resistance and which are difficult to correct by conventional chemical processes. Any resin suitable for use as the continuous surface of a gravure print surface may be used. Various resins have been proposed in the literature, especially acetal resins and epoxy resins. See for instance GB 1,544,748, 2,034,636, 2,071,011 and 2,071,574. The plates preferably have a printing surface of an epoxy novolac based resin system, most preferably as described in EP 0094142.The process of the invention is also useful on plates of a soft metal, for example copper or aluminium, and on plates where the cells are preformed of metal and, before engraving, are filled with removable resin. The physical resist must have properties such that it protects the cell walls against abrasion during the deepening of the cells by abrasion. It may be wholly resistant to abrasion, in which event the amount on the tops of the cell walls can be quite low, or it may be abraded to some extent by the abrasive, in which event the amount on the tops of the cell walls must be of sufficient thickness that they remain adequately covered by physical resist throughout the abrasion process. The physical resist is generally formed of an elastomeric material that is resistant to abrasion, most preferably an elastomer based on urethane. The resist is generally applied as a liquid using a soft, e.g. rubber, roller by conventional rolling up methods. The resist may be applied as several layers, particularly where the resist is sacrificial and therefore generally fairly thick. The rheology of the resist as it is applied must be such that the tops of the cell walls are completely covered. Generally the liquid does not penetrate to the base of the cells although some penetration can be tolerated provided the amount of resist in the base of the cells is sufficiently low that it can be abraded while the walls remain protected. The liquid is then cured to a solid, by conventional methods which may include polymerisation, e.g. by heating, evaporating off a solvent or exposing to U.V. light or, if the resist is applied as a melt, by cooling. Optionally, areas adjacent to those to be corrected may be fully stopped off, that is the cells are filled with a resist to prevent abrasion, before the step of abrading. The abrasion may be by a dry abrasion method in which fluid in which the particles are entrained is air or another gas. However unless the particles are very fine or relatively soft this is liable te give rather vigorous abrasion. To permit easier control of the degree of correction the jet of abrasive particles is preferably a slurry of the particles in a liquid, which is usually aqueous, generally water. The abrasive comprises finely divided particles of for instance silica, pumice or talc. The particle size is generally between 0.5 and 20 microns, preferably between 1 and 5 microns. The slurry is generally between 2 and 50 by volume in solids, preferably between 5 and 20 , and usually about 108. The slurry may comprise other reagents, for example a slurry used for abrading a metal surface may additionally comprise a chemical etchant to accelerate the engraving process. The etchant may be a conventional chemical etchant. It may be advantageous for slurries using a very fine abrasive, for example talc, to include a dispersant, for example a low molecular weight polymeric dispersant. The particles are suitably jetted through a conventional type of gun which may be hand held or automatically directed. The abrasive is generally fed to the gun as a more concentrated slurry or as a finely divided solid and the liquid or other fluid is fed to the gun separately. The abrasive is usually collected and recycled. The depth of engraving is dependent upon the pressure of the jet, the distance of the gun from the surface of the plate, the dwell time and the size of the abrasive particles. The depth will also depend of course on the nature of the plate. The pressure of the jet is usually between 300 and 1000 kPa, preferably from 450 to 600 kPa and often between 480 and 550 kPa. The gun will generally have a nozzle of 1 to 5 cm, preferably approximately 2.5 cm in diameter and may be held between 1 and 20 cm, preferably 2 to 10 cm, from the surface of the plate. The dwell time of the jet on the areas to be corrected may be from a few seconds to several minutes. The plate is generally rinsed after the abrasion step.The rinse is conveniently carried out using the same liquid as that which comprises the slurry pimply by closing off the abrasive feed to the gun. After the abrasion and the optional rinsing step, the resist is removed generally by dissolving off with a suitable solvent. Toluene and other aromatic hydrocarbons will dissolve many of the suitable elastomers. The plates may then be treated by conventional treatment steps. A metal plate may also be coated with, for instance chrome, to give a harder surface. The process of the invention is particularly suitable for feathering corrections since it is easy to produce areas over which there is a gradual increase and or decrease in the dwell time of the abrasive jet. By the method of the invention it is possible to use reagents and abrasives that are not environmentally hazardous and which do not require special precautions for their use. The resists do not need to be chemical resistant and it is therefore easier to find suitable resists. By the process of the invention the inner surfaces of the cells have suitable surface properties and are found to give reasonable properties with respect to release of ink on printing. The reagents used in the process are reusable and are in any case cheap. The equipment used to carry out the process of the invention is readily available or may be converted from equipment that is readily available and inexpensive. As an example, an epoxy novolac gravure cylinder may be formed as in EP 94142, laser engraved and proofed. In those areas where positive correction is required a urethane elastomer may be rolled onto the tops of the cell walls and cured. A 10 slurry of pumice below 5 microns particle size in water may be jetted into the cells needing correction from a 2.5 cm diameter nozzle, 10 cm from the plate, at a pressure of about 500 k Pa for about a minute, the time being sufficient to give the desired deepening but without exposing the tops of the cell walls. The plate may then be rinsed with water and the elastomer removed by application of toluene.
