# Liquid crystal type dazzle free reflection mirror.

## Abstract
A liquid crystal type dazzle free reflection mirror arrangement which change reflectivity of the incident light by way of changing the transmittivity of the incident light through a liquid crystal 6 provided within a frame body 2 is desclosed A semitransparent mirror 8 is positioned behind the liquid crystal 6 and a photo sensor 10 is positioned behind the semitransparent mirror 8 . When the photo sensor 10 detects that the intensity of the incident light passing through the semitransparent mirror is high, an alternating current electric field is applied to the liquid crystal 6 which responsively decreases the transmittivity of the incident light. A heater for heating the liquid crystal is activated when a door of an automobile is opened and the temperature of the liquid crystal is low.
