# Xerographic machine with means for replenishing the developer mix with virgin and used toner.

## Abstract
A transfer type xerographic machine employing a two component developer mix has two toner containers 80 and 81 in the developer station 25. One of these containers receives virgin toner, the other, toner collected by a cleaning station 38 from imaging element 12. The developer mix is replenished by toner from both containers simultaneously. A toner level monitoring system provides an indication of low level of virgin, but not used, toner.
