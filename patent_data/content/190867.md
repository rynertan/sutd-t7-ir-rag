# Process for manufacturing a photomask.

## Abstract
A photomask manufacturing process including a step of forming metal silicide film 4 on a transparent silica glass substrate 1 . A resist 3 is applied onto the metal silicide film 4 and then a patterning mask is provided by light or electron beam, followed by developing step. Exposed por tions of the metal silicide film is etched away using a dry etching process.
