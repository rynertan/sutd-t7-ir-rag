## Description
FUNCTIONALIZED POLYACRYLAMIDE GRAFTED STARCH POLYMER WET STRENGTH ADDITIVES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to the field of wet strength additives for paper products. Specifically, the present invention is a functionalized preferably glyoxalated polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer which can be used as a wet strength additive. The use of additives to improve the wet strength of paper materials is well known in the art.Typical wet strength sizing agents are glyoxalated acrylamide type polymers such as those disclosed inUSP Nos. 3,556,932 and 3,658,640, both of which issued to Coscia et al. Glyoxalated acrylamide starch polymers as described in USP No 3,740,391 issued to Williams et al have also been known heretofore. This patent discloses a water soluble ionic glucopyranosyl polymer, of which starch is a particular example, wherein 50 100 mole percent of the total number of glucopyranosyl or glucose linkages carry acrylamide linkages.This resulting polymer is reacted with glyoxal such that at least 0.05 percent of the acrylamide linkages carry glyoxal substituents. USP Nos. 3,061,471 and 3,095,391, issued to Brockway, disclose the preparation of acrylamide starch polymers prepared with a mild oxidizing agent, such as persulfates, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroperoxides. The resulting polymer has acrylamide polymers grafted to the glucose linkages of the starch. SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION The present invention provides a functionalized preferably glyoxalated polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer which is useful as a wet strength additive. Specifically, the functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer is prepared by reacting a material containing two or more aldehyde units with a polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer comprised of at least about 5 weight percent polyacrylamide, preferably, from about 5 to about 90 weight percent, more preferably, from about 5 to about 70 weight percent. In one preferred embodiment, the polyacrylamide is from about 5 to about 15 weight percent of the corresponding polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer, as defined below, while in another preferred embodiment from about 15 to about 70 weight percent.The functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer is provided with an effective amount of substituents derived from a material containing aldehyde units for providing sufficient wet strength to paper prepared with the functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention is a functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer which is useful as a wet strength agent for paper substrates. The functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer of the present invention is comprised of a starch backbone from which polyacrylamide segments, as defined below, are grafted by a free radical or an equivalent reaction process. This polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer is then reacted with a material containing two or more aldehyde units preferably glyoxal . The resulting functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer is essentially water soluble, as would be necessary in the conventional wet end treatment of paper pulp. The preferred method of preparing functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer in accordance with the present invention involves the free radical polymerization of acrylamide monomer from the starch. It is believed that a free radical is formed on the starch backbone which free radically polymerizes acrylamide monomer. Typically, these polyacrylamide grafted starch polymers are prepared by suspending the starch in an aqueous solution, adding acrylamide monomer, heating the suspension until the starch is gelatinized and then adding free radical catalyst. The free radical polymerization reaction is typically carried out above the gelatinization temperature of the starch.Free radical catalysts useful in accordance with this invention may be those of the type that establish mild oxidizing conditions in the reaction mixture in the concentrations used and are usually classified as free radical formers or sometimes called peroxidic catalysts. This class of catalysts include, among others, hydrogen peroxides, aqueous soluble organic peroxides, hydroperoxides, persulfate salts such as potassium and ammonium persulfate and ceric ion. Other free radical catalysts are those classified as water soluble 1 azo1, catalysts such as 2,2 azo bis amidinopropane hydrochloride.The reaction is typically carried out until all of the acrylamide monomer is consumed. The resulting polymer is comprised of a starch upon which polyacrylamide segments are grafted. This polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer is then functionalized by reacting with a material containing two or more aldehyde units e.g., glyoxal by methods well known to those skilled in the art such as by a condensation reaction. For the purposes of the present invention, the term polyacrylamide l shall mean a polymer segment having more than two repeating units of vinyl type monomer residues prepared by a free radical or an equivalent polymerization process, wherein at least about 50 weight percent of the polymer segment is acrylamide monomer residue. More preferably, the polyacrylamide of the present invention consists essentially of acrylamide monomer residue. It is believed that polyacrylamides as prepared in accordance with the present invention will typically have a minimum molecular weight of about 350. However, this is only a theory and should in no manner be taken to limit the scope of the present invention. All references herein to molecular weights refer to number average molecular weights which are determined by well known methods. As defined above, the polyacrylamide seg I ments of the present invention are comprised of at least about 50 weight percent acrylamide with up to about 50 weight percent of the polyacrylamide segments comprised of other vinyl type monomers. For the purpose of the present invention, other vinyl type monomer shall mean any of various organic compounds containing a vinyl group which is available for free radical or equivalent polymerization provided such compound is capable of copolymerizing with acrylamide monomer to result in a polymer segment, which polymer segment when containing at least 50 weight percent acrylamide monomer residue and grafted to starch and functionalized as taught herein results in a polymer which has utility as an essentially water soluble paper wet strength additive as taught herein In other words, any of a wide variety of comonomers are envisioned as being able to be employed without destroying the utility of the functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymers taught herein.Typically, vinyl type monomers other than acrylamide are used to provide the polymer of the present invention with anionic or cationic charges which as well known to those skilled in the art is useful when preparing paper by differing processes. Included among these compounds are styrene and substituted styrenes such as vinyl toluene, a methyl styrene and chlorostyrene compounds having the acrylic group as the polymerizable nucleus, such as acrylic and methacrylic acids, and salts or esters thereof including the methyl, ethyl, and butyl esters acrylonitrile vinyl chloride vinyl acetate and other vinyl esters vinyl pyridine and vinyl pyrrolidone vinyl ketones vinylidene compounds, such as vinylidene chloride allylidene compounds such as allylidiene diacetates conjugated diene monomers such as butadiene 1,3, isoprene, chlorobutadiene l,3 and so on Other vinyl type monomers useful which will impart an ionic charge to the glyoxalated polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer, include diallylamine and its respective salts, N alkyl diallylamine and its respective salts, diallyl dialkyl ammonium quaternary salts,N,N dialkyl aminoalkyl acrylate and methacrylate and their respective salts, N,N dialkyl amino alkyl acrylamide and methacrylamide and the respective salts and Ar vinylbenzyldialkyl amine and their respective salts, and such acids as vinylsulfonic acid, styrene sulfonic acid, meth acrylamidopropanesulfonic acid and their respective salts. Starches which are useful in preparing the polymers of the present invention include various carbohydrates such as, for example, indian corn starch, rice starch, waxy maize, waxy sorghum starch, tapioca starch, wheat starch, potato starch, pearl starch, sweet potato starch and derivatives thereof.The derivatives within the definition of the term starchy herein include oxidized starches, hydroxyalkylated starches, carboxyalkylated starches, various solubilized starches, enzyme modified starches, etc.Thus, any of a wide variety of starch derived materials can be used so long as they comprise material having repeat units of D glucose linked together as in starch and containing sites for grafting of the polyacrylamide segments as taught herein. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the starch from which the grafted starch polymer is prepared is a degraded starch. By degrad ed starch it is meant a starch which has been subjected to any of the degrading processes which are well known to those skilled in the art, such as reacting the starch with selected acids or enzymes, such that the resulting starch when in a 25 percent solids starch aqueous solution will possess aBrookfield viscosity of less than about .05 Pa.s and, more preferably, less than about .03 Pa.s.The measurement of Brookfield viscosity is well known in the art. A typical enzyme used to prepare degraded starches is a amalyase. The functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer of the present invention is prepared by reacting a material containing two or more aldehyde units, such as glyoxal, with a polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer which is comprised of at least 5 weight percent polyacrylamide preferably from about 5 to about 90 weight percent, more preferably, from about 5 to about 70 weight percent.In accordance with one preferred embodiment, the polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer is comprised of from about 5 to about 15 weight percent of polyacrylamide while in another preferred embodiment from about 15 to about 70 weight percent For the purpose of the present invention, the calculation of the weight percentage of polyacrylamide in the functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer shall be expressed in terms of the weight of polyacrylamide in the corresponding polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer with the term corresponding polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer meaning the polymer corresponding to the functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer but without the aldehyde derived substituents. The term functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer shall mean the polymer with the aldehyde derived substituents. The amount of substituents derived from a material containing aldehyde units present on the glyoxalated polyacrylamide grafted starch polymers of the present invention is an effective amount for providing paper which has been prepared using the polymer of the present invention with sufficient wet strength.More specifically, by effective amount of such substituents it is meant an amount which results in a functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer which when added to paper stock at about 10 kgs tonm with the paper stock being 50 50 hardwoodsoftwood and the paper prepared therefrom having a basis weight of about 13.6 keg 278.7 2 will provide the paper with an initial wet strength of at least about 200 gram cm, which result is an improvement over the wet strength obtained in the same test employing just the corresponding polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer. The wet strength is calculated according to the Technical Association of the Pulp and PaperIndustry standard test procedure T4560M 82, copyright 1982 by the Technical Association of the Pulp andPaper Industry, Technology Park Atlanta, P. O.Box 105113, Atlanta, GA 30348, U.S.A. Preferably, the weight ratio on a solid basis of the corresponding polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer to substituents derived from a material containing aldehyde units is at least 1 1, preferably, from about 1 1 to about 20 1, more preferably about 5 1 to about 20 1, even more preferably about 8 1 to about 15 1. One method of preparing the functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer is by condensing a polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer with the aldehyde containing material, e.g., glyoxal, in an aqueous solution at a pH between 7 and 9 5. Glyoxal is the preferred material to functionalize the polymers of the present invention.Other preferred materials containing more than one aldehyde unit include gluteraldehyde, cyanuric acid acrolein condensates i.e., cyanuric acid aldehydes , hexaglyoxalolmelamine, and condensate resins containing two or more reactive aldehyde groups such as melamine aldehyde condensates. Other exemplary materials include malondialdehyde, succindialdehyde, tetraglyoxalolurea, urea melamine glyoxal condensates and phenol aldehyde condensates. Any material which provides the desired functionality on the polymers of the present invention to result in the utility taught herein may be employed. A material containing more than one aldehyde unit can react with the amide functionality of the polyacrylamide resulting in the polyacrylamide segment being functionalized with a unit having one or more aldehyde units, e.g., glyoxal reacts with the amide functionality of the polyacrylamide forming substituents having the theoretical formula NH CH OH CHO. The aldehyde unit remaining on the polyacrylamide segment is available for further reaction in the process of paper treatment. The functionalized polyacrylamide starch polymer of the present invention is typically applied to the wet end of a paper making process. The general manufacturing process for paper including the term wet end is well known to those skilled in the art.Generally, the amount of the functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymers of the present invention used to prepare paper on a solids weight basis is between about 2.5 kgs tonm and about 12.5 kgs ton. As will be demonstrated below, one of the preferred embodiments of functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymers in accordance with the present invention is wherein the polyacrylamide is from about 5 to about 15 weight percent of the corresponding polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer. This polymer provides paper with an unexpectedly improved wet strength that may be reduced to less than about 50 percent of the original wet strength after prolonged i.e., 5 to 30 minutes soaking. Typical applications, where it is advantageous to have this type of reduction of wet strength are uses such as paper towels and toilet paper. In fact a permanent wet strength may not only be unnecessary for these types of applications, but may inhibit the decomposition of the paper materials in the natural environment, causing a pollution problem. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the polyacrylamide is from about 15 to about 70 weight percent of the corresponding polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer. As will be demonstrated below, these polymers when used to prepare paper provide the paper with unexpectedly improved wet strength. Glyoxalated acrylamide starch polymers, such as those exemplified in USP No. 3,740,391 issued toWilliams et al, teach starch polymers wherein 50 100 mole percent of the glucose linkages carry acrylamide linkages which can be subsequently reacted with glyoxal. The polymers as exemplified by the Williams et al patent were prepared by reacting starch and acrylamide in the presence of sodium hydroxide which catalyzes an addition reaction between the acrylamide monomer and the starch. It is believed that the resulting polymers prepared by this reaction process and as taught by the Williams et al patent are comprised of monomeric acrylamide linkages attached to the starch. This is in contrast to the polymers of the present invention wherein polyacrylamide is grafted to the starch by free radical or equivalent polymerization.In any event, as will be demonstrated below, functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymers in accordance with the present invention when used to prepare paper provide the paper with unexpectedly improved wet strength properties over the above discussed prior art glyoxalated acrylamide starch polymers. The following Examples illustrate the functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymers in accordance with the present invention and compare these starch polymers with those polymers exemplified in Williams et al patent. EXAMPLES 1 5 Examples 1 5 demonstrate the preparation of glyoxalated polyacrylamide grafted starch polymers in accordance with the present invention. All of these examples were prepared by the procedure as set forth below and from an enzyme converted corn starch i.e., degraded starch which had a Brookfield viscosity at 25 percent solids in water of less than .03 Pa.s. This enzyme converted corn starch was prepared by adding to a slurry of Penford Gum 290 a hydroxyl ethyl ether derivative of corn starch sold by Penick Ford,Limited, a subsidiary of. Penwest, 1001 First Street,S.W., Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 52406, with the numerical designation 290 referring to the degree of substitution the process for manufacturing these starches is described in U. S. Patent Nos. 2,516,632, 633, and 634 0.3 0.4 grams gm of an a amalyase enzyme for every 350 gm of corn starch, heating the mixture to 760 C and holding at this temperature for 1 hour. The temperature of the mixture was raised to 960 C and held at this temperature for 15 minutes. The procedure for preparing the glyoxalated polyacrylamide grafted starch polymers of Examples 1 5 is as follows. First, polyacrylamide grafted starch polymers were prepared in an aqueous solution by charging a 4 neck round bottom flask with acrylamide monomer, the enzyme converted corn starch, water and an ionic monomer which provides the final polymer with an ionic charge for purposes well known to those skilled in the art any suitable ionic monomer can be used in the amounts listed below in Table I. The contents of the flasks were heated to 800 C at which time three separate equal portions 6.67 milliliters ml of potassium persulfate a 3 percent aqueous solution were added to each flask in over a ninety minute period 0, 45 and 90 minutes . The contents of the flasks were then allowed to cool to room temperature. Next, these polyacrylamide grafted starch polymers were glyoxalated by separately reacting the prepared polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer solutions at room temperature with 10 gm of an aqueous solution of glyoxal 5 gm of glyoxal and raising the pH of each solution to between about 8 and about 8.5 with a 10 NaOH aqueous solution. The amounts of acrylamide monomer, starch, water, ionic monomer and the percent of polyacrylamide and weight ratio of corresponding polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer to glyoxal derived substituents used for each of the Examples 1 5 is listed below in Table I.

EXAMPLES 6 AND 7 Examples 6 and 7 were prepared substantially in accordance with the procedures outlined in USP No.3,740,391 for Example 1, which teaches the preparation of a glyoxalated acrylamide starch polymer for use as a wet strength agent. These examples were prepared for comparing the wet strength properties of these polymers with those of the present invention. Example 6 was prepared from Apollo 480 a cationic ether derivative of corn starch also sold byPenick Ford, Limited while Example 7 was prepared from the same starch which was degraded as described above for Examples 1 5. In both Examples 6 and 7 acrylamide monomer and starch were dissolved in water.To this mixture, an aqueous solution of NaOH was added and the temperature of the mixture was raised to and held at 700 C for 1 hour. The amounts of acrylamide, starch, water, NaOH, and acrylamide to glyoxal used for each example is listed below in Table II. These mixtures were then cooled to room temperature at which time they were poured into 5 liters 1 of stirring methanol. The methanol was decanted off and the mixture was allowed to dry overnight forming a precipitate. 50 gm of each of the resultant precipitates were redissolved in 1250 ml of water. The temperature of each mixture was raised to about 95 980 C and held at this temperature for 30 minutes. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature and 30 gm of Na2HPO4.7H2O were added to each mixture. The pH of each mixture was adjusted to 7.9 by adding a sufficient amount of NaOH. To each mixture 110 gm of water and 63 gm of a 40 aqueous glyoxal solution 0.043 moles were added. The mixtures were stirred for 1 to 2 hours at 500 C until there was an appreciable increase in the viscosity of the solution. The reaction was terminated by adjusting the pH to 3.5 with 12 Normal N HC1 solution and cooling to room temperature. As seen from the above description, the procedure is substantially as set forth in Example 1 of the 391 patent, except for an approximate 10 fold increase in the amounts of materials used to prepare the polymers. This was done to ease the handling of the materials. TABLE IIEx.

G. MacDonald, Editor J. N.Franklin, Tech. Editor, McGraw Hill Book Company, 1970. The functionalized polyacrylamide grafted starch polymer was added at 10 kgs tonm to a paper stock of 50 50 bleached hardwood kraft softwood kraft.On the Pilot Fourdrinier paper machine which was used, the addition point was between the machine chest and the fan pump with in line mixing providing uniform dispersion throughout the thick stock. The paper samples prepared using each of the starch polymerExamples 1 7 were cut into strips for the measurement of wet strength by the aforementioned TechnicalAssociation of the Pulp and Paper Industry TAPPI , standard test procedure T4560M 82 which is well known to those skilled in the art. Three wet strength measurements were made of each paper sample the first being the initial wet strength measured after saturation of the paper with deionized water and the second and third after the paper was subjected to soaking in deionized water for 5 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively.The resulting wet strengths for each paper sample are listed below in Table III according to the starch polymer example used to prepare the paper.
