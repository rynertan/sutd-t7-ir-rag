# Natural gas and air mixing device.

## Abstract
A mixing device for feeding a conventional carburated internal combustion engine with a mixture of natural gas and air. The device includes a gas plenum which disperses natural gas through apertures into a mixing chamber, where the gas mixes with air drawn through passageways in an annular rim which is fitted over the air intake of a convention al carburetor. The construction of the device allows alternate operation of the engine with gasoline as the fuel.
