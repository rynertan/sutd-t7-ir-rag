# Derivative of adult T cell leukemia virus antigen peptide.

## Abstract
Recombinant plasmids are constructed by inserting a DNA fragment coding for a fused protein of an adult T cell leukemia virus antigen peptide and an enzyme into a vector DNA. Microorganisms are transformed with the recombinant plasmid and thereafter cultured to express the fused protein. The fused protein is useful for the detection and diagnosis of adult T cell leukamia.
