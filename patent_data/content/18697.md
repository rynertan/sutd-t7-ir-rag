# Digital frequency detector for detecting one or more of a plurality of fixed frequencies in an analog signal.

## Abstract
Device for digitally detecting one or more of a plurality of fixed frequencies in an analog signal according to correlation method, the fixed frequencies occurring in a first group and in a second group, and the third harmonic of one or more frequencies of the first group being equal or almost equal to a frequency of the second group. Reference pulse series containing for each of the frequencies of the first group six equidistant pulses per period, which pulses have the values 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, and 0, respectively, and containing for the frequencies of the second group two equidistant pulses per period, which pulses have the values 1 and 1, respectively, can be stored in a reference memory 5 . There are means for reading the reference memory 5 at a frequency the value of which is equal to the product of the number of memory places in the reference memory and the frequency which is the highest common factor of the frequencies to be detected.
