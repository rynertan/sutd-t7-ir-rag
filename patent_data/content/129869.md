# Method of making replaceable lamp unit for automotive headlight.

## Abstract
A method of making a replaceable lamp unit 10 for use within an automobile headlight. The method comprises the steps of providing three spaced apertures 29 within a wall 25 of a plastic holder 19 , positively securing a metallic eyelet 27 within each aperture, attaching a metallic support wire 43 to each of at least two lead in wires 31 of an electric lamp 39 , inserting the support wires within each of the eyelets and thereafter soldering 45 the support wires to the respective secured eyelets. Precise alignment of the envelope 33 of the electric lamp is provided prior to the soldering operation. The soldering operation assures not only a sound electrical connection, but also provides both a hermetic seal between eyelet and support wire components and a means for maintaining the lamp support wire sub assembly in fixed position with the holder.
