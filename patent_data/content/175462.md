# COOKING PAN BOTTOM CONFIGURATION

## Abstract
A die formed cooking utensil 10 for use on a cooking heat source has a side wall 11 and a bottom wall 12 . The bottom wall is provided with a raised area 15 generally centred on the centre of the utensil, said raised area having a maximum elevation of between 0.17 and 0.25 cm above the lowermost plane 14 of the bottom wall when the utensil is cold. The bottom wall is deformed to be substantially planar when heated to cooking temperature. The raised area may comprise an annular region 15 which surrounds a less elevated central region 17 but other configu ration of the bottom wall are also possible.
