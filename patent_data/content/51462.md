# SPEECH PROCESSOR

## Abstract
A system and apparatus for generating human speech or other complex sounds from a digital command signal and using a hybrid synthesis technique comprises a digital, fixed repertoire speech processor 10 which includes a first circuit 12 for modeling the behaviour of the human vocal tract and a second circuit 11 for controlling the behaviour of the modeling circuit 12 . The processor may advantageously be implemented on a single VLSI integrated circuit chip.
