# Resin derived from acenaphthene and process for its production.

## Abstract
The resin comprises oligomers of naphthalic acid groups bridged by substantially only keto groups, the oligomers being joined together with a di or tetra functional primary aromatic amine and having been derived from a resin produced by acid catalysed condensation of acenaphthene and a formaldehyde donor. It is envisaged that the resin will be of use in the preparation of drogue parachutes and in other circumst ances where a thermally stable resin is required.
