# Robot control data processing apparatus.

## Abstract
A robot control data processing apparatus comprises a robot control data dividing processor 24 for dividing a robot control data 40 46 adapted for monitoring and controlling robots into a plurality of operation elements 50, 60, 70 56, 66, 76 57, 67, 77 and storing the robot control data in unit of the operation element, and a robot control data editing processor 26 for selectively combining and editing one or more of the plurality of the divisional operation elements 50, 60, 70 56, 66, 76 57, 67, 77 . The robot control data is prepared by teaching the robots in operation and or prog ramming a robot oriented language.
