## Abstract
A stator assembly of an electric motor includes a lamination stack, a field coil, an end cap 80 having a plastics body 85 fixed to the lamination stack, a brush box 81 made of electrically conducting material, mounted on the plastics body and housing brushes resiliently biased towards the axis of the assembly and a plurality of electrical conductors 91A, 91B, 106, 108 in the form of strips of predetermined configuration located on the plastics body for making electrical connections between components of the motor. The electrical conductors include a first conductor 106 extending from the brush box 81 , a second conductor 108 extending from a termination of the field coil and a conducting means 90 , which incorporates an inductance, connects the first and second conductors. The inductance in the connection is altered by altering the inductance of the conducting means. The first conductor 106 is wrapped around the brush box 81 to give a good and reliable electrical connection. The end wall of the brush box 28 is connected by a tongue enabling it to be flexed repeatedly to allow brush replacement without the end wall breaking off. An impedance, typically a capacitor, that is connected across the power supply of the motor is clamped on the end cap by a plastics clamping arm 111 .
