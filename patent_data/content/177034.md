# Plastic parts with surface hardening coating containing ultraviolet absorber.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an improved surface hardening coating on a plastic body such as a plastic lens. The surface hardening coating consists of a hard coat layer of a polymer base composition and an underlying primer layer, which contains an ultraviolet absorber low in the bleeding tendency amount ing to 0.5 50 wt of the plastic component of the primer. A triazole having a vapor pressure not higher than 1 10 ‚Åµ KPa at 100 C is preferred as the ultraviolet absorber. The introduction of such an ultraviolet absorber into the primer layer has the effect of greatly enhancing the durability and weatherability of the coating without sacrificing the surface hardness.
