# Forming corrosion resistant coatings upon the surfaces of metals, especially zinc.

## Abstract
An aqueous alkaline coating solution having a pH value no greater than about 10.2, for forming on metal especially zinc surfaces a corrosion resistant coating, which may itself be coloured and serves as a good foundation for subsequently applied overlying siccative coatings, contains in solution one or more of the follow ing metals cobalt, nickel, iron and tin together with an inorganic compiexing material which is effective in maintaining the metal in solution and optionally, a re ducing agent. A process for forming coatings by contact ing the metal surface with the solution includes the step s of preliminary make up and or subsequent re plenishment of the solution with appropriate concentra tes. The replenishment concentrate with a pH of 6.8 7.2 containing cobalt and or iron also contains an organic complexing agent.
