# Apparatus for producing a woven slide fastener stringer.

## Abstract
An apparatus for producing a woven slide fastener stringer includes a loom 11 for weaving a stringer tape 12 and a rotor assembly 13 for coiling an element forming monofilament 14 around a mandrel 24 to form a coiled coupling element 26 , which is then woven into the stringer tape along a longitudinal edge thereof. The rotor assembly 13 comprises a rotor 33 rotatably mounted eccentrically on a stationary shaft 34 and having a guide hole 43 for passage therethrough of the monofilament 14 and a pin 44 angularly spaced 180 degrees from the guide slot and slidably received in a radial slot 48 in a radial arm 47 to which there is drivingly connected a drive shaft 36 rotatably mounted on the stationary shaft 34 . When the drive gear 49 rotates, the guide hole 43 rotates at a reduced angular velocity as it approaches the loom, thereby allowing harnesses 31 for warp threads 30 which bind the coupling element 26 to be moved across the orbital path 55 for the monofilament 14 without interference.
