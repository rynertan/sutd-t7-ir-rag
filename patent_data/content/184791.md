# Information processing device capable of rapidly processing instructions of different groups.

## Abstract
In an information processing device comprising an in struction decoder 11 , an instruction processing unit 12 , and a memory unit 13 , the instruction decoder 11 classi fies a sequence of instructions into a first group for the in struction processing unit 12 and a second group for mak ing the memory unit 13 cooperate with the instruction pro cessing unit 12 . The instructions of the first group are tem porarily retained in an instruction stack register 36 before delivery to the instruction processing unit 12 while the in structions of the second group is directly delivered to the memory unit 13 . A state indication unit 32 produces a plu rality of flags representative of internal states of the instruc tion processing unit 12 . A monitoring unit 42 monitors the instructions, the retained first group instruction, and the flags to enable the instruction processing unit 12 , the memory unit 13 , and the instruction stack register 36 and to change the flags. The memory unit 13 can consecutively be accessed for loading the instruction processing unit 12 with data signals or for storage of data signals into the in struction processing unit 12 so as to make the same con tinuously run without superfluous interruption because the instructions of the second group are executed prior to ex ecution of the first group.
