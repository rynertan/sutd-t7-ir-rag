## Description
COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING FLURBIPROFEN OR IBUPROFEN Flurbiprofen and ibuprofen are nor steroidal antiinflammatory drugs which are used in rheumatic and degenerative diseases of the joints and for reducing platelet adhesiveness. Ibuprofen has been used to reduce dental pain. Acetaminophen is a known analgesic and anti pyretic drug. It is used in a wide variety of arthritic and rheumatic conditions involving musculoskeletal pain, for headache, dysmenorrhea, myalgesia and neuralgias, and as an analgesic anti pyretic in patients who are sensitive to aspirin. The usual adult oral dose is 0.3 to 1 g, administered three or four times a day. The administration of acetaminophen as a supplemental analgesic in clinical studies of flurbiprofen administration is disclosed inEuropean Journal of Rheumatology and Inflammation, vol. 3, no. 3, pp. 180 186 1980 and Br., J. Clin. Pharm. 11, pp. 477 484 1981 .The administration of acetaminophen as a supplemental analgesic in clinical studies of ibuprofen administration is disclosed in Scand.J. Rheumatology 7 113 117 1978 and Annals of the RheumaticDiseases, vol. XXVIII, pp. 513 517 1969 . A pharmaceutical oamposition according to the invention comprises flurbiprofen or ibuprofen, or a C18 alkyl ester or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof acetaminophen and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. For concomitant administration, a package comprises a first pharmaceutical composition comprising flurbiprofen or ibuprofen, or a C18 alkyl ester or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and a second compositicn comprising acetaminophen and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Examples of esters are methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and octyl esters. Examples of salts are sodium, potassium and ammonium salts. Administration of compositions of the invention allows acetaminophen to be used in an amount less then its usual therapeutic analgesic dose. The low amount of acetaminophen in the combination provides the advantage of reducing the gastric erosion or distress that can accompany the administration of a therapeutic amount of flurbiprofen. The dose of flurbiprofen, its salts or esters, is the same dose known for treating conditions for which it is known to be useful. In general, from about 1 mg to about 5 mg per kilogram body weight is administered daily in single or divided oral dosage amount. The dose of ibuprofen, its salts or esters, is the same dose known for teaching conditions for which it is known to be useful. In general, from about 5 mg to about 50 mg per kilogram body weiaht is administered daily in single or divided oral dosage amounts. The amount of acetaminophen to be administered concomitantly is less than the therapeutic dose of 300 mg to 1 gm, preferably about 60 or less. The acetaminophen and flurbiprofen or ibuprofen can be administered in the same dosage unit or can be prepared in separate dosage units and the dosage units administered at the same time. Different forms of dosage units can be used, i.e., a tablet of flurbiprofen or ibuprofen and a capsule of acetaminophen. The compositions of the present invention are preferably presented for oral administration to humans or animals in unit dosage forms, such as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules, and oral syrups, solutions, or suspensions, and the like, containing suitable quantities of the combination of active ingredients. Fcr oral administration either solid or fluid unit dosage forms can be prepared. Powders are prepared quite simply by comminuting the active ingredients to a suitably fine size and mixing with a similarly comminuted diluent. The diluent can be an edible carbohydrate material such as lactose or starch. Advantageously, a sweetenina agent or sugar is present as well as a flavoring oil. Capsules are produced by preparing a powder mixture and filling into formed gelatin sheaths. Advantageously, as an adjuvant to the filling operation, lubricant such as talc magnesium stearate, calcium stearate and the like is added to the powder mixture before the fill ing operation. Soft gelatin capsules are prepared by machine encapsulation of a slurry of active ingredients with an acceptable vegetable oil, licht liquid petrolatum or other inert oil or triglyceride. Tablets are made by preparing a powder mixture, granulating or slugging, adding a lubricant and pressing into tablets. The powder mixture is prepared by mixing the active ingredients, suitably comminuted with a diluent or base such as starch lactose, kaolin, dicalcium phosphate and the like. The powder mixture can be granulated by wetting with a binder such as corn syrup, gelatin solution, methylcellulose solution or acacia mucilage and forcing through a screen. As an alternative to granulating, the powder mixture can be slugged, i.e., run through the tablet machine and the resulting imperfectly formed tablets broken into pieces slugs . The slugs can be lubricated to prevent sticking to the tablet forming dies by means of the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc or mineral oil. The lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets. Advantageously, the tablet can be provided with a protective coating consisting of a sealing coat or enteric coat of shellac, a coating of sugar and methylcellulose and a polish coating of carnauba wax. Fluid unit dosage forms for oral administration such as syrups, elixirs and suspensions can be prepared wherein each teaspoonful of composition contains a predetermined amount of the active ingredients for administration. The water soluble forms can be dissolved in an aqueous vehicle together with sugar, flavoring agents and preservatives to form a syrup. An elixir is prepared by using a hydroalcoholic vehicle with suitable sweeteners together with a flavoring agent. Suspensions can be prepared of the insoluble forms with a suitable vehicle with the aid of a suspending agent such as acacia, tragacanth, methylcellulose and the like. The term unit dosage form as used in the specification and claims refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human and animal subjects, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of flurbiprofen or ibuprofen calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with acetaminophen and the required pharmaceutical diluent, carrier or vehicle. The specification for the novel unit dosage forms of this invention are dictated by and are directed dependent on a the unique characteristics of flurbiprofen or ibuprofen and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and b the limitation inherent in the art of compounding such an active material for therapeutic use in humans, as disclosed in this specification, these being features of the present invention.Examples of suitable unit dosages forms in accord with this invention are tablets, capsules, troches, powder packets, wafers, cachets, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls, segregated multiples of any of the foregoing and other forms as herein described. The following examples are illustrative of the present invention, but are not intented to be limiting.Example 1 Hard Gelatin Capsules One thousand two piece hard gelatin capsules for oral use, each capsule containing 50 mg of flurbiprofen and 150 mg acetaminophen are prepared from the following types and amounts of ingredients Fl urbiprofen 50 gm Acetami nophen 150 gm Lactose 100 gm Corn starch 20 am Talc 20 gm Magnesium stearate 2 gm The flurbiprofen and acetaminophen finely divided by means of an air micronizer are added to the other finely powdered ingredients, mixed thoroughly and then encapsulated in the usual manner. The foregoing capsules are useful for treating rheumatic diseases by the oral administration of one capsule four times a day. Using the procedure above, capsules are similarly prepared containing acetaminophen in 100 and 75 mg amounts by substituting 100 and 75 gm of acetaminophen for the 150 gm used above.Examples 2 Soft Gelatin Capsules One piece soft gelatin capsules for oral use, each containing 50 mg of flurbiprofen and 75 mg of acetaminophen finely divided by means of an air mirconizer are prepared by first suspending the compounds in 0.5 ml of corn oil to render the material capsulatable and then capsulating in the above manner.
