A masking cover for a wall surface 16 around a pipe 15 which emerges therefrom, constituted by two circular con centric plates 10 and 11 each provided with a radial slot 13 having parallel edges which are connected together by a semicircular portion 14 having its centre coinciding with that of the plates 10 and 11, the plates being arranged for mounting by way of their slot 13 around the pipe 15 in order to form a single stable facing in the form of a circular masking cover.
