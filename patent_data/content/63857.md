# Multi component valve which can be assembled in a straight line or in an elbow configuration.

## Abstract
In order to provide a valve which can be assembled in two different configurations, for insertion either be tween two aligned conduits or between two conduits forming a 90 elbow, the valve body 20 is divided in two halves or main components 31, 32 along a plane inclined at 90 to the axis of the obturator spindle 11 such that the two halves can be assembled either with the axes of the connection sleeves 21, 22 aligned or with the axes of such sleeves at 90 to each other.
