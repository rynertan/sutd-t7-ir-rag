## Description
A LIQUID MIXING EXTRACTORBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a liquid mixing extractor which mixes a plurality of liquid agents such as adhesives, and puts it out while mixing subsequent agents.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Conventionally, there have been extractors pressing out the plurality of the adhesives at the same time, but those means merely push out the liquids and do not have a mixing function. SUMMARY OF THE INVENT ION It is an object of the invention to provide a liquid mixing extractor which could satisfactorily agitate and mix the liquid agents such as the adhesives, and press out the complete mixture. It is another object of the invention to provide a liquid mixing extractor which may be easily treated. It is a further object of the invention to provide a liquid mixing extractor which heats the liquid agents to be mixed for increasing a mixing effect. It is a still further object of the invention to provide a liquid mixing extractor which is easily cleansed and can be repeatedly used. Other and further objects, features and advantages of the invention will appear more fully from the following description.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a plan view of an embodiment of the invention Fig. 2 is a side view of the same Fig. 3A, Fig.3B, Fig. 3C and Fig. 3D show shapes of end portions of agitating bars, respectively Figs.4 and S show mechanisms for reciprocating agitating bars Fig. 6 shows an agitating bar with a screw Figs.7 and 8 show mechanisms for mixing the agents with heating devices Figs.9 and 10 show amechanism for mixing the agents with a zigzag plate Fig.ll shows a cross sectional view of the product made through the above mechanism Fig.12 shows another agitating bar rotation mechanism Fig. 13 shows the other agitating bar rotation mechanism and, Fig.14 shows the other mixing nozzle.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is to offer a liquid mixing extractor which is equipped with a plurality of cylinders in parallel, and the front ends of these cylinders ai i t into one body at a mixing nozzle having an agitating function, whereby a plurality of the liquid agents are pressed out in complete mixture. Figs.l to 3 illustrate an embodiment where the liquid agents are agitated and mixed by an agitating bar to be rotated by a motor. The cylinders 1, 1 herein are double into which double pistons 2, 2 are inserted from the rear side of the shown mixing extractor, and are connected via a thumb plate 3. At the front end of the cylinders, a mixing nozzle 4 is provided. As seen in Fig 5.6 and 8, the nozzle 4 communicates with flow passages from the cylinders. The agitating bar 6 goes into the mixing nozzle 4 at its end portion. As end portions of the agitating bars, various kinds will be assumed, and Figs.3A to D show some examples thereof. Fig.3A shows that lots of bar like projections 7 are radially extended from the agitating bar 6. Fig.3B shows that plate like projections 8 are substituted for the bar like ones 7. Fig.3C shows that the agitating bar 6 is formed in wave.Fig.3D shows that the agitating bar 6 is formed in crank shape. The motor 5 has a power source of a cell 9, and it is preferable that the motor 5 and the cell 9 are, as seen inFig. 2, positioned above the cylinders 1, 1. Figs.4 and 5 illustrate mechanisms of reciprocating the agitating bar 6. Fig. 4 shows a cam 10 to be rotated by a motor 11. As the cam 10, such as a cylindrical cam is preferable. The agitating bar 6 is secured by mounting on a coil spring 12 between the cylinders 1, 1. Therefore, the agitating bar 6 is pushed in accompany of rotation of the cam 10 and returned by the coil spring 12, so that it is reciprocated laterally. Fig. 5 shows that a magnet 13 or an iron piece is secured on the agitating bar 6 and held between a couple of magnets 14, 15, and either plus or minus of the magnets 14, 15 is successively broken, so that the agitating bar 6 is moved. The end points of the agitating bar 6 of Figs.4 and 5 are shaped in the same as said above. Fig. 6 shows an embodiment having a screw 17 to be rota ed by the motor 16 at a junction of the mixing nozzle 4. Fig. 7 shows an embodiment covered with a heater 18 around an outer circumference of the mixing nozzle 4. This heater 18 heats the liquids flowing within the mixing nozzle 4. The mixing nozzle 4 is preferably made of such as cupper or the like of high heat conductivity. The heater 18 may be made of a resistor as nichrome wire. If a ceramic heater is used, a desired temperature may be easily obtained without a control circuit. When the liquid agents are heated for mixture, the viscosity is lowered so that the fluidity is increased and workablity is heightened such as mixture, defoam and coating. In addition, since a chemical reaction is accelerated, time for solidification is saved. Fig. 8 shows an embodiment positioning a spiral heater 19 of a cartridge type in a junction of the mixing nozzle 4.The adhesive within the mixing nozzle 4 is heated by the heater 19 and follows the spiral. The heating effect is as said above. Fig. 9 shows an embodiment comprising a zigzag plate 20 to be positioned at a junction of the mixing nozzle 4. Fig.10 illustrates mixing thereby. When the liquid agents are supplied at both sides A and B of the zigzag plate 20, the liquid agents are partitioned by the zigzag plate 20 as seen in Fig.ll and taken out in lamination. Fig.12 shows an embodiment rotating the agitating bar 6 by pushing a pistion 2. The cylinder 1 is provided with a flange 22 defined with a female screw 21 into which a screw shaft 23 is screwed, the screw shaft 23 being held with a thumb plate 3 at its rear side and provided with a driving gear 24 at its front end to be geared with a gear 25 fixed to the agitating bar 6 pivoted on the cylinder 1. The end point of the agitating bar 6 is as mentioned above and positioned within the mixing nozzle 4. When the piston 2 is pushed, the screw shaft 23 is pushed, but since the screw shaft 23 is in mesh with the female screw 21, it is rotated. Then the agitating bar 6 is rotated, since the driving gear 24 engages the gear 25. Fig.13 shows an embodiment having a handle 26 on the cylinder 1. The handle 26 and the agitating bar 6 are connected via bevel gears 27, 28. If the handle 26 is rotated, the agitating bar 6 is driven. Fig.14 shows an embodiment dividing a mixing part of the nozzle 4 into the two sections, and each of them is provided with weirs 29 in obliquity. The adhesives change the flowing direction by means of the weirs 29, and are agitated and mixed.The remaining adhesive solidified after use is easily removed by opening the mixing part. In each of the above mentioned embodiments, the adhesive is charged int., the cartridge und in the cylinder 1, it is directly poured into the cylinder. The agitating and mixing mechands is furnished in th mixing nozzle, and a plurality of the liquid agents may be exactly agitated and mixed.
