# Process for the preparation of sulfonylamino benzophenones.

## Abstract
A novel process is provided which produces intermedi ates useful in the regiospecific synthesis of benzimidazole antiviral agents. The process comprises reacting a 3 fluoro 4 nitrobenzophenone with an anion of a sulfonamide to yield a 3 substitutedsulfonylamino 4 nitrobenzophenone. Novel in termediates are also disclosed.
