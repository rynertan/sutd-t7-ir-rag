# Repair of blast furnace refractory walls.

## Abstract
A method for making repairs in the refractory wall of a blast furnace is described which comprises the steps of providing an opening through the furnace wall, providing a guide bar member and a tubular member which fits on the outside of the guide bar member, the tubular member having a plurality of slits in its axial direction, forcing the guide bar member together with the tubular member under pressure into the furnace so as to spread the divided pieces of the tubular member having a reinforced stud function, each in the manner of a flower petal, and forming a repaired refractory body incorporating a support structure consisting of radially spread pieces of the tubular member.
