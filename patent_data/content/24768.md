# Key loop.

## Abstract
A key loop for releasably supporting keys on the key head of a key case. The loop is of integral construction and formed of spring metal rod stock and includes an enlarged head 12 for connecting the loop to the key head at the upper end of a shank portion 15 which extends downwardly from the head. From the lower end of the shank, the key loop is reversably curved outwardly and upwardly with its free end terminating adjacent the inner surface of the shank 15 at a substantial distance below the head. The free end of the key loop includes a retainer portion 30 which extends inwardly and at least partially toward the lower end of the loop. The upper surface of said retainer portion and opposed portion of the shank provide an access opening 18 for the apertured head of a key. The inner surface of said retainer portion 30 serves to prevent inadvertent removal of a key from the loop.
