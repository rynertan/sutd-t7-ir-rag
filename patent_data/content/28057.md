# Process for preparing dimethylaminosilanes.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a dimethylaminosilane having the general formula H Preferably a fluid bed reactor is used and the copper activated silicon particles are prepared in situ during the process. The described process avoids the use of an inter mediate product between silicon and the desired silane by using a one step reaction. The dimethylaminosiane products are useful as poly mer cross linking agents, e.g. for vulcanisabie silicone rub ber compositions,
