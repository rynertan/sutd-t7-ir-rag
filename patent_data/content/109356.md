# ELECTRODE FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE PROCESSES AND ITS USE

## Abstract
Electrode for high temperature processes, comprising an active section and a cooling section attached to it and extend ing into the furnace interior, said cooling section 3 comprising at least one heat pipe 5 with a polytropic heat exchanger in the furnace interior which has an additional cooling system e.g. 6 in Fig. 1 for the dissipation of heat. The additional cool ing system may comprise further heat pipes, a gas and or a fluid circulation system, with the cooling fluid being pumped, and or a heat insulation. The electrode is intended for use in high temperature pro cesses, particularly in the production of steel. It is character ized by a safe and flexible manoeuvrability.
