# Polymer composition.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a polymer composition based on a copolymer of an unsaturated nitrile, a substantially saturated rubber, a chlorinated polyethylene, and a vinyl chloride polymer. To improve the impact resistance and the flexural modulus the polymer composition according to the inven tion comprises a. 50 95 parts by weight of a.1 5 70 parts by wt. of one or more polymers obtained by polymerizing a mixture of 10 90 wt. styrene and or styrene derivatives, 90 10 wt. acrylonitrile and or methacrylonitrile, and 0 20 wt. of one or more other monomers, and a.2 95 30 wt. of vinylchloride polymer, and b. 5 50 parts by weight of b.1 a substantially saturated rubber, and b.2 chlorinated polyethylene, with the vinychloride polymer content in the overall polymer composition being not lower than 25 by weight.
