# Emission computed tomography apparatus.

## Abstract
An emission computed tomography apparatus in which a radiation detector 12 is moved along an elliptical orbit about a subject 13 under examination. The effective field of view of the radiation detector is reduced depending on the position of the detector. Thereduction of the field of view produces a false image in a reconstructed image and re duces spatial resolution. To prevent this, part of image data, collected by the detector at a first position, for part of the subject from which radiation cannot be detected due to the reduced effective field of view, is interpolated with part of image data, collected by the detector at a second position, for the part of the subject from which radiation cannot be detected at the first position. The first and second positions are opposite to each other with the subject interposed therebetween.
