# Protective relaying methods and apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention provides methods and apparatus for detecting a single phase to ground fault on a three phase electrical power system, and for identifying a faulted phase. A single phase to ground fault is correctly distinguished from other faults, including phase to phase to ground faults, even with transmission lines which utilize series capacitors, by taking into consideration the phase to phase voltage which is in quadrature with the voltage to ground of the monitored phase.
