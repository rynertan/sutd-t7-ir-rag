# Heating apparatus.

## Abstract
Heating apparatus consists of a shallow circular tray 1 having a layer 2 of thermally insulative material disposed therewithin and supporting a number of infra red emitting, tunsten halogen lamps 7 on flanges 3,4 , beneath a glass ceramic cooktop. A moulding 8 of ceramic fibre material is press fitted around the ends of the lamps 7 and a thermal limiter 11 is provided to limit the operating termperature of the cooktop. The tray is constructed so as to constrain infra red energy from the lamps to preferentially heat a defined area of the cooktop so as to form a hot plate in said area.
