# Process and apparatus for cleaning solids laden gas.

## Abstract
A solids laden gas is cleaned by introducing a fluid in the gas to saturate the gas and allowing liquid to condense onto the solids to form enlarged particles. Liquid separated from the gas with enlarged particles is atomized in the gas, to form ag glomerates of liquid and enlarged particles, whereafter the formed agglomerates are separated from the gas, for recover ing substantially solids free gas. Apparatus for carrying out the above process.
