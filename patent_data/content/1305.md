# Anionic surfactant containing detergent compositions having soil release properties.

## Abstract
Detergent compositions, particularly effective in removing oily soils from hydrophobic fibers, such as polyester, are disclosed, containing specific anionic surface active agents, polyester soil release polymers, and which may contain only limited amounts of certain incompatible anionic surface active agents. The process of laundering fabrics in aqueous solutions of these compositions is also disclosed.
