## Description
Light sensitive silver halide photographic materialBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a novel light sensitive silver halide photographic material used for formation of photographic images. More particularly, it relates to a novel light sensitive silver halide photographic material which is capable of forming dot images of high contrast and has high usefulness in the filed of lithography.Heretofore, photographic images of very high contrast have been known to be formed by use of a light sensitive silver halide photographic material. For instance, known is a method in which dot images or line originals of high contrast is obtained by treating a light sensitive silver halide photographic material comprising a silver chlorobromide or silver chloroiodide emulsion which contains fine grains of silver halide grains having a mean grain size of about 0.5 p or less, having a narrow grain size distribution and uniform grain size, and has the content of silver chloride being, e.g., 50 moles or more, with use of an alkaline developing solution having low sulfite ion concentration and containing only hydroquinone as a developing agent. This kind of light sensitive silver halide photographic emulsion is known as a lith type light sensitive silver halide photographic material, which is generally used during the lithographic procedures to convert the variation in concentrations of continuous gradation in an original to the aggregation of dots having larger to smaller areas in proportion to the concentrations. For such convertion, the lith type light sensitive silver halide photographic material is used, whereby dot images are formed by photographing an original through means of a cross line screen or a contact screen, and then carrying out development with use of a so called lith developer, or a lith type developing solution, which has very low sulfite ion concentration and, in addition, contains only a hydroquinone developing agent.Gamma of this lith type light sensitive silver halide photographic material is 5 or 6 at most even when processed by an ordinary developing solution having high sulfite ion concentration, e.g., a commercially available developing solution for processing a photographic paper, thereby frequently generating fringes which must be prevented with utmost care for the purpose of the dot formation.Accordingly, it has been considered essential for the material to be used in combination with the above lith type developing solution when it is used for the halftone negative positive. This lith type developing solution, which is disclosed in detail in J. A. C. Yule J.Franklin Institute, Vol. 239, page 221 1945 , contains substantially only hydroquinone as a developing agent, and is a developing solution which plays a role as an antioxidant for the developing agent, having low sulfite ion concentration.Such developing solution has inferior preservativity and is subject to autoxidation. Accordingly, in order for lithographers to obtain halftone negative and halftone positive immages always having high quality, it is required to control the developing solution to keep constant its degree of activity which may have decreased with lapse of time, thereby inevitably being accompanied with troublesome operations.Since advantages from improvement in the preservativity of the lith type developing solution are very great, enormous efforts have been made for such improvement.However, the improvement having been made was absolutely insufficient as compared with developing solutions having high preservativity, such as Metol hydroquinone developing solution and Phenidone hydroquinone developing solution which are developing solutions for continuous tone.Now, several attempts have been made to provide a method of forming high contrast images suitable for lithography development by use of a phenidone hydroquinone type developing solution having high sulfite iron concentration. For instance, Japanese Unexamined PatentPublication No. 106244 1981 discloses that the high contrast images can be obtained by using a hydrazine compound and incorporating into a developing solution an amino compound in an amount by which the development may be promoted. Also, Japanese Patent Publications No.17825 1984, No. 17818 1984, No. 17819 1984, No.17820 1984, No. 17821 1984, No. 17826 1984, No.17822 1984, etc. disclose light sensitive silver halide photographic materials containing a tetrazolium compound.However, in the former art using the hydrazine compound, it is required to adjust the pH of the developing solution to as high as about 12, and therefore there is a problem in the stability of the solution. Moreover, black dots called black pepper are generated at non image portions, thereby causing serious drawbacks in the practical use.Also, the tetrazolium compound disclosed in the latter arts, which, however, has no drawback as in the former art, can not be said to be very satisfactory in the light of high contrastiness and dot quality. This means that there is in fact a background that no prior art materials can be said to have attained sufficient performance corresponding to the recent trend to the remarkable improvements in the field of lithography. Thus, it has been sought after to make further improvement in the method for formation of high contrast images with use of the tetrazolium compound.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is an object of this invention to provide a light sensitive silver halide photographic material which may solve the above mentioned problems in the silver halide emulsions employing the tetrazolium compound, and which has very high contrast and also is stable as being free from detorioration of its performance during storage under high temperature and high humidity.As a result of intensive studies, the present inventors found that the above problems can be solved by providing a light sensitive silver halide photographic material having on a substrate at least one silver halide emulsion layer and at least one hydrophilic colloid layer, wherein a triphenyltetrazolium compound represented by the following General Formula I is incorporated in at least one of said silver halide emulsion layer and said hydrophilic colloid layer, whereupon this invention has been accomplished.General Formula I EMI5.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 each represent a hydrogen atom or a group showing a negative value in Hamett s sigma value ap , and P represents an p2 anion except that R11 R and R3 are hydrogen atoms at the same time. Also, a light sensitive silver halide photographic material which is stable as being free from detorioration of its performance even during storage under high temperature and high humidity, can be obtained by providing a light sensitive silver halide photographic material having on a substrate at least one silver halide emulsion layer and at least one hydrophilic colloid layer, wherein the silver halide grains contained in said silver halide emulsion layer are those formed in the presence of a water soluble rhodium salt used in an amount of 1 x 10 7 to 5 x 10 7 mole per mole of silver halide and, at the same time, at least one triphenyltetrazolium compound represented by the following GeneralFormula I is incorporated in said at least one hydrophilic colloid layer.General Formula I EMI5.2 wherein R1, R2 and R3 each represent a hydrogen atom or a group showing a negative value in Hamett s sigma value asp , and represents an anion except that R1, R2 and P3 are hydrogen atoms at the same time.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTSAs mentioned above, it is required in this invention that the subsitutents R1, R2 and R3 in the phenyl groups of the triphenyltetrazolium compound represented by GeneralFormula I or I represent a hydrogen atom or a group showing a negative value in Hamett s sigma value ap which indicates an electron withdrawing degree, namely, an electron withdrawing group.Hamett s sigma value in the phenyl substitution is seen from a number of papers, for instance, a report by C.Hansch et al, disclosed in Journal of Medical Chemistry, vol. 20, page 304, 1977. Groups having the negative sigma value may inlude, for example, methyl group top 0.17 hereinbelow all in ap value , ethyl group 0.15 , cyclopropyl group 0.21 , n propyl group 0.13 , iso propyl group 0.15 , cyclobutyl group 0.15 , n butyl group 0.16 , iso butyl group 0.20 , n pentyl group 0.15 , cyclohexyl group 0.22 , amino group 0.66 , acetylamino group 0.15 , hydroxyl group 0.37 , methoxyl group 0.27 , ethoxyl group 0.24 , propoxyl group 0.25 , butoxyl group 0.32 , pentoxyl group 0.34 , etc. These are useful as the substituents for the compound of General Formula I or I of this invention.Of the compounds according to General Formulae I and I , preferable compounds are the componds having the total carbon atom numbers when the respective carbon atom numbers in the substituents R1, R2 and R3 are totaled, of 4 or less, preferably 2 or less, in the light of the dot quality. Also, it is preferable that R1, R2 and R3 are each substituted at the para position of the phenyl ring.On the other hand, also preferable are the compounds in which at least one of these substituents is a hydrogen atom, more specifically, any one of R1, R2 and R3 is a hydrogen atom, more preferably, R1 is a hydrogen atom.When any one of R1, R2 and R3 is a hydrogen atom, it is preferred that at least one of the remaining two substituents represents an alkyl group. When both the two substituents are alkl groups, it is preferred that both of them are alkyl groups having the same carbon atoms, and it is further preferred that they are the same alkyl group.Specific examples of the compounds represented by GeneralFormula I or I used in this invention inlude, but are by no means limited by, the following EMI7.1 EMI8.1 EMI9.1 EMI10.1 EMI11.1 The tetrazolium compound used in this invention can be readily synthesized by a method dislcosed, for instance, in Chemical Reviews, Vol. 55, pp.335 483.The tetrazolium compound of this invention may preferably be used in an amount ranging from about 1 mg to about 10 g, preferably from about 10 mg to about 2 g, and more preferably from about 10 mg to about 1 g, per mole of the silver halide contained in the light sensitive silver halide photographic material of this invention.The light sensitive silver halide photographic material according to this invention comprises a substrate and at least one silver halide emulsion layer and at least one hydrophilic colloid layer provided by coating on the substrate. This silver halide emulsion layer may be either directly coated on the substrate or coated thereon by interposing a hydrophilic colloid layer containing no silver halide emulsion, and the hydrophilic colloid layer may be either coated on the silver halide emulsion layer or coated as a protective layer between the substrate and the silver halide emulsion layer. Further, the silver halide emulsion layers, when provided in plurality, may comprise silver halide emulsion layers each having different sensitivity, e.g., high sensitivity and low sensitivity.In this occasion, the silver halide emulsion layers may be provided between the layers with an intermideate layer of a hydrophilic colloid layer, or may be provided with an intermediate layer between a silver halide emulsion layer and a protective layer. The layer in which the tetrazolium compound of this invention is incorporated is the silver halide emulsion layer and or the above mentioned various kind of hydrophilic colloid layers.The most preferred embodiment of this invention is a light sensitive silver halide photographic material in which the tetrazolium compound of this invention is incorporateded in the silver halide emulsion layer and also the hydrophilic colloids contained in the silver halide emulsion layer and the hydrophilic colloid layer are gelatin derivatives.In order to incorporate the tetrazolium compound of this invention in the silver halide emulsion layer and or the hydrophilic colloid layer, there may be employed a method in which the tetrazolium compound is added by dissolving it in a suitable aqueous and organic solvent a method in which the compound is added by dissolving it in a suitable aqueous and organic solvent and then mixing in a matrix of a hydrophilic colloids such as gelatin or gelatin derivatives, or after dispersing it in a latex.Any of these method may be employed in this invention.The tetrazolium compound used in this invention can attain preferable image properties when used singularly.Also, this tetrazolium compound does not adversely affect the image properties even when two or more kinds of the compound are used in combination at an appropreate proportion. Further, the tetrazolium compound of this invention and the other tetrazolium compounds outside this invention may also be used in combination at an appropreate proportion.As a preferred embodiment of this invention, the tetrazolium compound according to this invention may be incorporated into a silver halide emulsion layer. In another preferred embodiment of this invention, it is incorporated into a hydrophilic colloid layer directly adjacent to a hydrophilic colloid layer containing a silver halide emulsion, or into an adjacent hydrophilic colloid layer by interposing an intermediate layer. As a still another embodiment, the tetrazolium compound according to this invention may be incorporated into a light sensitive silver halide photographic material by dissolving it in a suitable organic solvent, for example, alcohols such as methanol and ethanol, ethers, esters, etc., and then directly applying the mixture thus obtained on an outermost layer of silver halide emulsion layers of the light sensitive silver halide photographic material.In this invention, a particularly preferable result can be obtained when an anion is used in combination as it bonds to the tetrazolium compound of this invention to lower the hydrophilicity of the compound. Such anion may include, for example, acid radicals of inorganic acids such as perchloric acids, acid radicals of organic acids such as sulfonic acids and carboxylic acids, and anion type activators. More specifically, it may include lower alkylbenzenesulfonate anions such as p toluensulfonate anion, p dodecylbenzenesulfonate anions, alkylnaphthalenesulfonate anions, laurylsulfate anions, tetraphenylborates, dialkylsulfosuccinate anions such as di 2 ethylhexylsulfosuccinate anion, polyether alcohol sulfuric acid ester anions such as cetylpolyethenoxysulfate anion, stearate anion, polyacrylate anion, etc.These anions may be previously mixed with the tetrazolium compound of this invention and thereafter added to a hydrophilic colloid layer. Alternatively, they may be added singularly to a silver halide emulsion layer or a hydrophilic colloid layer containing or not containing the tetrazolium compound of this invention.The water soluble rhodium salt which may be used in this invention may include rhodium dichloride, rhodium trichloride, ammonium hexachlororhodate, etc., and preferably, a halogen complex compound of trivalent rhodium, e.g., hexachlororhodium III acid or its salt or rhodium trichloride trihydrate.In this invention, the amount of adding the water soluble rhodium salt may be 1.0 x 10 7 to 5.0 x 10 7 mole per one mole of silver halide. When the water soluble rhodium salt is in less than 1.0 x 10 7 mole, the stability under high temperature and high humidity which is an aim in this invention will become insufficient. On the other hand, when it is in more than 5.0 x 10 7, the desensitizing effect by the watersoluble rhodium salt to the silver halide will increase as well known to a person skilled in the art, thereby making it difficult to obtain desired sensitivity.In this invention, the water soluble rhodium salt may be present at the time of formation of silver halide grains.The words the time of formation is herein meant to be a course during which the silver halide is emulsified and subjected to physical ripening, and it may be added at an optional time during this course and by a conventional manner. However, it is preferably added at the time of emulsification. More preferable is a method in which an emulsion is prepared by adding the water soluble rhodium salt in a halide solution. The distribution of rhodium ions in the silver halide emulsion should preferably be uniform for each of the silver halide grains. There is no particular limitation for its distribution in one grain, and its distribution at the surface of a grain and the inside of the grain may be uniform or its distribution may be partial to the surface side or the inside.The silver halide used in the light sensitive silver halide photographic material of this invention is preferably silver chlorobromide having the AgCl AgBr ratio of 100 0 to 2 98, particularly preferably the one having the AgCl AgBr ratio of 90 10 to 50 50.Also, the silver halide grains are preferably of monodispersed type, having a mean grain size of from 0.15 vm to 0.40 ijm and a grain size distribution coefficient, represented by standard deviation in grain size distribution mean grain size , of 15 or less.Preferably, the silver halide emulsion layer according to this invention may be prepared in the following manner.Namely, the silver halide emulsion in the silver halide emulsion layer may be prepared by a method of preparing a silver halide photographic emulsion by adding in an aqueous solution of hydrophilic colloid an aqueous solution of a water soluble silver salt and an aqueous solution of a water soluble halide in accordance with a double jet method, wherein said aqueous solution of a water soluble silver salt and said aqueous solution of a water soluble halide are added at an addition rate such that the rate of growth of silver halide grains in said aqueous solution of hydrophilic colloid does not exceed the critical growth rate, and EAg value of said aqueous solution of hydrophilic colloid is kept at substantially constant value set within the range of from 140 mV to 200 mV during a period corresponding to one thirtieth 1 30 to one fifth 1 5 of the whole addition period from initiation of mixing and, thereafter, kept at substantially constant value set within the range of from 80 mV to 140 mV during a period corresponding to at least a half 1 2 of the whole addition period.The words the rate of growth of silver halide grains does not exceed the critical growth rate means that the supersaturated concentration at which new nuclei of silver halide grains are generated is not ocurred in a solution.The critical growth rate herein mentioned can be determined by actually forming crystals in an actual system while varying the rate of addition of various silver ions and halogen ions, and making sampling from a reaction vessel to confirm the presence or absence of the generation of new nuclei by an electron microscopic observation.The EAg value is a concept well known to a person skilled in the art, designating a silver potential which is indicated by a value measured with use of a metal silver electrode and a double junction type saturated Ag Cl reference electrode.For instance, the EAg value is disclosed in JapaneseUnexamined Patent Publication No. 197534 1982.The silver halide used in this invention may be sensitized by use of various kinds of chemical sensitizers. The sensitizers may include, for example, active gelatins, sulfur sensitizers such as sodium thiosulfate, arylthiocarbamide, thiourea and arylisothiacyanate , selenium sensitizers such as N,N dimethylselenourea and selenourea , reduction sensitizers such as triethylenetetramine and stannic chloride and various noble metal sensitizers typically exemplified by potassium chloroorite, potassium orithiocyanate, potassium chloroorate, 2 orosulfobenzothiazol methylchloride, ammonium chloropalladate, potassium chloroplatinate, sodium chloropalladite, etc. Each of them may be used singularly or in combination of two or more kinds. When gold sensitizers are used, ammonium thiocyanate may be used as an auxiliary. The silver halide emulsion used in this invention may be subjected to optical sensitization with use of one or more of sensitizing dyes to impart sensitivity to each of the desired light sensitive wavelength region. The sensitizing dyes to be used may include various ones, and the optical sensitizing dyes advantageously usable in this invention may inlclude cyanines, merocyanines, trinulear or tetranuclear merocyanines, trinuclear or tetranuclear cyanines, styryls, holopolar cyanines, hemicyanines, oxonols, hemioxonols, etc. These optical sensitizing dyes are preferably those which contain in a part of the structure a basic radical such as thiazoline and thiazole or a nucleus such as rhodanine, thiohydanto in, oxazolidinedione, berbituric acid, thioberbituric acid and pyrazolone, as a nitrogen containing heterocyclic nucleus.Such nucleus may undergo alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, halogen, phenyl, cyano or alkoxy substitution. Also, these optical sensitizing dyes may have undergone condensation with a carbocyclic ring or a heterocyclic ring. When the above optical sensitizing dyes, in particular, the merocyanine type sensitizing dyes are used, an effect of widening the development latitude can be obtained in addition to the optical sensitization.Also, the silver halide emulsion used in this invention may be stabilized by use of the compounds disclosed, for instance, in U.S. Patents No. 2,444,607, No. 2,716,062 and No. 3,512,982, West German Patent Publications No.1,189,380, No. 2,058,626 and No. 2,118,411, JapanesePatent Publication No. 4133 1968, U.S. Patent No.3,342,569, Japanese Patent Publication No. 4417 1972 No.4417 1972, West German Patent Publication No. 2,149,789,Japanese Patent Publications No. 2825 1964 and No. 13566 1974 preferably, for example, 5,6 trimethylene 7 hydroxy s triazolo l,5 a pyrimidine, 5,6 tetramethylene 7 hydroxy s triazolo 1,5 a pyrimidine, 5 methyl 7 hydroxy s triazolo l,5 a pyrimidin, 7 hydroxy striazolo l,5 a pyrimidine, 5 methyl 6 bromo 7 hydroxy striazolo l,5 a pyrimidine, gallates such as isoamyl gallate, dodecyl gallate, propyl gallate and sodium gallate , mercaptans such as l phenyl 5 mercaptotetrazole and 2 mercaptobenzothiazole , benzotriazoles such as 5 brombenzotriazole and 5 methylbenzotriazole , benzimidazoles such as 6 nitrobenzimidazole .The above silver halide and the tetrazolium compound may be present in a hydrophilic colloid layer, and the hydrophilic colloid particularly advantageously usable in this invention is gelatin.

These developing agents may be used singularly or in combination of two or more kinds, but more preferred is to use two or more kinds.Further, in the developing solution used in this invention, sulfite such as potassium sulfite and ammonium sulfite may be used as a preservative. Even if it is used, the effect of this invention will not be damaged, and this can be said to be one of the features of this invention. Hydroxylamines and hydrazide compounds may also be used as the preservative.In addition, it may be optioanlly carried out to control the pH of, and impart buffer action to, the developing solution by using alkali hydroxide, alkali carbonate or amine which is usually used in a black and white developing solution, and to add an inorganic development restrainer such as potassium bromide and an organice development restrainer such as benzotriazole, or to add an agent of capturing metal ions, such as ethylenetetradiamine IV acetic acid, a development accelarator such as methanol, ethanol, benzylalcohol, polyalkyleneoxide, a surface active agent such as sodium alkylarylsulfonate, natural saponin, saccarides and an alkyl ester of the above compound, a hardening agent such as glutaraldehyde, formalin and glyoxal, and an ion strength regulator such as sodium sulfate.The developing solution used in this invention may further contain alkanol amines and glycols as organic solvents.

As to the processing temperature, the developing temperature, for instance, is preferably 500C or lower, particularly preferably, 300C or lower.The development may be completed in 3 minutes in general, particularly preferably in 2 minutes to often bring about desired results. Further, optionally employable processing steps other than the development are, for example, water wahing, stopping, stabilizing, fixing, and further optionally, prehardening, neutralization, etc., which may be omitted accordingly. Still further, these processing steps may be carried out in either the so called development by hand such as dish development and frame development or the mechanical development such as roller development and hanger auto development.This invention will be described in greater detail by the following Examples.Example 1Silver chlorobromide emulsions were prepared by use of the following solutions, Solution A, Solution B andSolution C.Solution A Ossein gelatin 17 g 10 Ethanol solution of sodium poly isopropyrene polyethyleneoxy disuccinate 5 ml Distilled water 1280 ccSolution B Silver nitrate 170 g Distilled water 410 mlSolution C Sodium chloride 40.9 g Potassium bromide 35.7 g 10 Ethanol solution of sodium poly isopropyreneoxy disuccinate 5 ml Ossein gelatin 11 g Distilled water 407 mlAfter keeping Solution A at 400C, sodium chloride was added so as to give the EAg value of 160 mV.

Also, in adding Solution B and Solution C was used a roller tube quantitative pump of a flow rate variable type a pump capable of controlling the flow rate .During the addition, electron microscopic observations were performed by sampling of the emulsions to confirm that no generation of new grains was recognized in the system.Also during the addition, the system was controlled by use of a 3 aqueous solution of nitrous acid to keep constant the pH value therein at 3.0.After completion of the addition of Solution B andSolution C, the emulsion was subjected to Ostwald ripening, followed by desalting and water washing by a conventional method. Thereafter, 600 ml of an aqueous solution of ossein gelatin containing 30 g of ossein gelatin were added for dispersion with stirring at 550C for 30 minutes to prepare 750 cc of the emulsion.Thereafter, the emulsion was subjected to gold sulfur sensitization, and as a stabilizer 6 methyl 4 hydroxy1,3,3a,7 tetrazaindene was added thereto.

Co., Ltd. The above sample pieces were processed by means of a automatic processing machine having a developing tank of 40 lit. capacity, using a developing solution according to the prescriptions mentioned below and a commercially available fixing solution.Development Conditions Step Temperature Time Developing 280C 30 Sec.

The exposure range at toe portion was indicated by the exposure range from 0.1 to 0.5 in optical density log E value and the gamma was indicated by tan 0 value of straight line portion ranging from 1.0 to 2.5 in optical density.As for the samples on which xenon light was used to carry out halftone photography with use of a lithographic camera, dot quality of the dots formed was evaluated.The dot quality was evaluated by a five stage indication system in which a dot being small in fringe was indicated as 5 when the state of fringe or fading observed at the periphery of dots was visually judged as to the so called 50 dots which are equal in the dot portion area and the clear portion area. Namely, 5 means to be excellent and 1 means to be very poor. When the 50 dot quality is not more than 3 , such value can not in general be made acceptable.Results of the above are shown in Table 3.

All ofSample Nos. 12 to 20 in which the phenyl substituents are electron withdrawing groups are quite insufficient for use as light sensitive materials for lithography.Also,Sample No. 11 wherein triphenyltetrazolium chloride is used is applicable, though unsatisfactorily, to practical use. However, the difference in its performance is clear when compared with those employing the compound of this invention.Thus, the light sensitive silver halide photographic material according to this invention, containing the tetrazolium compound having the electron donative substituent can achieve very high contrast and high dot quality, and has properties particularly excellent for the lithography.Example 2Silver chlorobromide emulsions were prepared by use of the following solutions, Solution A, Solution B andSolution C.Solution A Ossein gelatin 17 g 10 Ethanol solution of sodium poly isopropyrene polyethyleneoxy disuccinate 5 ml Distilled water 1280 ccSolution B Silver nitrate 170 g Distilled water 410 ml Solution C Sodium chloride 38.0 g Potassium bromide 41.7 g Rhodium trichloride trihydrate, in an amount shown in Table 5 10 Ethanol solution of sodium poly isopropyrene polyethyleneoxy disuccinate 3 ml Ossein gelatin 11 g Distilled water 407 mlWhile keeping Solution A at 400C, Solution B and SolutionC were added by a double jet method with stirring by use of a mixing stirrer disclosed in Japanese UnexaminedPatent Publications No. 92523 1982 and No. 92524 1982.

Thereafter, 600 ml of an aqueous solution of ossein gelatin containing 30 g of ossein gelatin were added for dispersion with stirring at 550C for 30 minutes to prepare 750 cc of the emulsion.In measurement of the EAg value, used were a silver metal electrode and a double junction type saturated Ag AgCl reference electrode To constitute the electrode was used a double junction disclosed in Japanese Unexamined PatentPublication No. 197534 1982. .Also, in adding Solution B and Solution C was used a roller tube quantitative pump of a flow rate variable type.During the addition, electron microscopic observations were performed by sampling of the emulsions to confirm that no generation of new grains was recognized in the system.Also during the addition, the system was controlled by use of a 3 aqueous solution of nitrous acid to keep constant the pH value therein at 3.0.Emulsions EM 1 to EM 7 were prepared while varying the amount of rhodium trichloride trihydrate in Solution C as shown in Table 5.

As a result, all the samples showed cubic crystals and very good monodispersity. These emulsions were subjected to gold sulfur sensitization, and as a stabilizer 6 methyl 4 hydroxy l,3,3a,7tetrazaindene was added thereto. Further added as a sensitizing dye was l B hydroxyethyl 3 phenyl 5 3 y sulfopropyl a benzoxazolidine ethylideneithio hydantoin in an amount of 150 mg per one mole of Ag.Next, 2,3 di p toryl 5 phenyltetrazolium chloride Exemprary Compound 2 in amount of 700 mg, sodium p dodecylbenzene sulfonate in amount of 400 mg, saponin in amount of 3.5 g and a styrene maleic acid copolymer in amount of 2 g per one mole of Ag, respectively, were added to the emulsions, which were applied on substrates by coating so as to have the Ag amount of 4.0 g m2 and the gelatin amount of 2.0 g m2. Simultaneously, as a protective layer, a gelatin layer containing 30 mg m2 of sodium l decyl 2 3 isopentyl succinate 2 sulfonate as a spreading agent and 25 mg m2 of formalin as a hardening agent was overlapped by coating so as to have the gelatin amount of 1.2 g m2 . Samples thus obtained were divided into two groups, one of which was left as it is, and the other of which was, after humidity controlled at 250C and relative humidity of 80 , hermetically wrapped with a water proof packaging material and heated at 500C for 72 hours, in order to evaluate the stability of the performance. Both groups of the samples were applied with optical wedge and carried out the exposure by use of a tungsten light source.The above test samples were processed by means of a automatic processing machine having a developing tank of 40 lit. capacity, using a developing solution according to the prescriptions mentioned below and a commercially available fixing solution.Development Conditions Step Temperature Time Developing 280C 30 Sec.

The sensitivity was determined from a reciprocal number of the amount of exposure required for giving 2.5 in opotical density, and indicated by a relative sensitivity when the sensitivity of a sample prepared by use of EM 4 is regarded as 100. Also, the sharpness at the toe portion was indicated by the exposure region log E value of 0.1 to 0.5 in optical density. The smaller this value is, it means that the sample has desired characteristics as being excellent in the sharpness of the toe portion.The above results are shown summarizingly in Table 6.

The samples were subjected to halftone stepwise exposure by xenon light with use of an optical wedge. Developments were carried out in the manner according to Example 2 to evaluate the sensitivity and the quality of dot dot quality of each of the samples.
