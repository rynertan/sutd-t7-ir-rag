## Description
There has long been a need in the field of drug delivery devices to have a drug released in the human or animal tissue at the place where it is most therapeutically effective and to have said drug released in the tissue in a controlled manner over a long period of time. U.S. Patents 4,093,709 and 4,304,767 disclose polymers which can be used as a matrix to contain a drug. The polymers contain labile backbone bonds which hydrolyze in the presence of water causing a controlled erosion of the matrix and resultant release of the drug. These polymers have the disadvantage, however, that they hydrolyze extremely slowly. The polymers of the instant invention have the advantage that the pendant acid functionalities catalyze the hydrolysis of the labile polymer backbone bonds. The instant invention is directed to a poly ortho ester polymer with at least one labile backbone bond per repeating unit and at least one pendant acid functionality per thousand repeating units which is defined in more detail by the claims. The instant invention is also directed to a controlled release device which comprises The polymers of the instant invention may be prepared by reacting a polyol, preferably a diol, having a pendant acidic group with a polymer containing a labile backbone bond. Excess amounts of either component may be used in preparing the final polymer, although stoichiometric amounts are preferred. U.S. Patents 4,093,709 and 4,304,767, disclose numerous polyols. Any of these polyols may be modified to contain one or more pendant acidic groups per thousand repeating units, up to a maximum of one per repeating unit. The number of acid groups incorporated depends on the desired rate of erosion. For increased erosion, relatively more acid groups would be incorporated. A preferred group of polyols may be represented as follows where X is the acidic group and Y is a spacer group. R and Y may be an alkyl, aryl or substituted alkyl or aryl, preferably containing 1 to 18 carbon atoms, most preferably 2 to 10 carbon atoms. The Y group may optionally be eliminated. Any acidic group may be used in the polyol. Examples include carboxylic, carbon acid, phosphoric, sulfonic and sulfenic acid groups. Tri and higher hydroxyl functional polyols may be used, which will result in crosslinked polymers. Any poly ortho ester polymer containing at least one acid labile backbone bond per repeating units preferably two per repeating acid unit may be used to react with the polyol containing a pendant acid group. Examples of polyorthoesters, polyorthocarbonates are disclosed in U.S. 4,093,709, and 4,304,767, 4,221,779 and 4,150,108. The preparation of the polymers may be by a variety of methods. U.S. 4,093,709, column 8, line 11 through column 9, line 47, outlines several methods of preparation. Any beneficial substance e.g. therapeutics or biologically active agents may be used in the controlled release device. The substance should not significantly interfere with the acid catalyzed hydrolysis of the labile polymer backbone bond. Basic substances may cause some interference. It is preferred that any acid substances be in the salt form. Representative examples of the polyols are as follows 9,10 dihydroxystearic acid 3,6 dihydroxynaphthalene 2,7 disulfonic acid 2,4 dihydroxybenzoic acid 3,4 dihydroxycinnamic acid 6,7 dihydroxy 2 naphthalene sulfonic acid 6,7 dihydroxy 2 naphthalene sulfenic acid 2,5 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid 2,4 dihydroxypyrimidine 5 carboxylic acid 4,8 dihydroxyquinoline 2 carboxylic acid and mixtures thereof. It will be realized that these are merely representative examples and that any polyol containing an acidic group can be used provided it does not adversely affect the polymerization reaction or leads to toxicologically undesirable degradation products. Thus, any group that can be incorporated into the polymer and which when placed in water inonizes to produce a pH lower than about 7.0 is a useful group provided the above limitations are met. The molecular weight of the polymer is not critical. The molecular weight is preferably at least 1,000 as determined by low angle light scattering. Representative beneficial substances therapeutics and biologically active agents for incorporation into or to be surrounded by the polymer matrix to be used with this invention and to be released to an aqueous environment include without limitation, the following Other drugs having the same or different physiological activity as those recited above can be employed in drug delivery systems within the scope of the present invention. Other benificent compounds which can be released in a controlled manner over time can also be incorporated in the present invention. These include but are not limited to herbicides, pesticides, fertilizers, antifouling agents, biocides germacides . One skilled in the art would realize that any beneficial substances which are released to the aqueous atmosphere can be used in this invention. Drugs or therapeutically beneficial substances can be in various forms, such as uncharged molecules, components of molecular complexes, or nonirritating, phamacologically acceptable salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, borate, acetate, maleate, tartrate, salicylate, etc. For acidic drugs, salts of metals, amines, or organic cations e.g., quaternary ammonium can be employed. Furthermore, simple derivatives of the drugs such as ethers, esters, amides, etc which have desirable retention and release characteristics but which are easily hydrolyzed by body pH, enzymes, etc, can be employed. The amount of drug or beneficial substance incorporated into the polymer matrix will vary greatly depending on the partucular drug, the desired therapeutic effect and the time span in which the polymer matrix is eroded to release the particular drug. Thus, there is no critical upper limit on the amount of drug incorporated in the polymer matrix and the lower limit will also depend on the activity of the drug usually at least 0.1 , preferably 0.1 to 30 , by weight, based on the total weight of the device and the time span for the erosion of the polymer and subsequently the drug release. Thus, it is not practical to define a range for the therapeutically effective amount of drug to be incorporated in the novel polymer matrixes of the instant invention. Also in the case of the drug or other beneficial substance incorporated into the polymer matrix as stated above, the amount of drug or beneficial substance will depend on the type of drug or substance for the condition being treated and can generally be up to 70 of the polymer matrix by weight. The drug or other beneficial substance can be administered in various ways and shapes. For example, the polymer drug or beneficial substance can be incorporated into disc shaped devices, rods or sheets for under the skin implantation, spherical shapes and the like. Those skilled in the art would realise that the invention can be incorporated in any shaped device for the particular application it is being used for. The above described devices can be prepared by, for example At least enough water must be present in contact with the polymer to cause degradation. Water in excess of this amount will not materially effect the performance of the invention. When the polymer is exposed to water, the acid functionality of the polymer slowly catalyzes the hydrolysis of the labile backbone bond of the polymer, and the beneficial substance is released at a controlled rate. 16.30 g 0.113 moles of trans cyclohexanedimethanol, 8.15 g 0.069 moles of 1,6 hexanediol and 11.08 g 0.035 moles of 9,10 dihydroxystrearic acid where dissolved in 350 ml of tetrahydrofuran in a 1 liter 3 necked round bottom flask equipped with an overhead stirrer, argon inlet and rubber septum.
