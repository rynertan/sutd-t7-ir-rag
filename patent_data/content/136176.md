# ELECTROCHEMICAL CONVERSION OF OLEFINS TO OXYGENATED PRODUCTS

## Abstract
A process for the electrochemical conversion of an olefinic compound in its gaseous phase to an oxygenated derivative thereof in an electrochemical cell comprising an anode, a cathode and an electrolyte solution characterised in that the conversion of the olefinic compound to the oxygenated de rivative occurs within the electrolyte solution in a gas diffusion electrode.
