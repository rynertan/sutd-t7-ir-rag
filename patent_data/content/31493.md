# Alpha content match prescan method and system for automatic spelling error correction.

## Abstract
Method and system for reducing the computation re quired to match a misspelled word against various candi dates from a dictionary to find one or more words that represent the best match to the misspelled word. The method consists in inventorying steps 20 27 , without regard to position, the respective characters in the misspel led words and in each of the dictionary candidate words. Then steps 28 31 a candidate word is dismissed from additional processing if there is not a predetermined per centage match between its character content and that of the misspelled word. Such a prescan alpha content match reduces the number of candidates in contention so as to make a high resolution match computationally feasible on a real time basis.
