# High efficiency scroll type compressor.

## Abstract
An efficient scroll type compressor is disclosed which has a large number of spiral turns, yet yields gradual, con trolled compression. The compressor includes a housing, a fixed scroll and an orbiting scroll. The fixed scroll is fixedly disposed relative to the housing and has a circular end plate from which a first spiral wrap extends. The orbiting scroll has a circular end plate from which a second spiral wrap extends. The spiral wraps interfit at an angular and a radial offset to make a plurality of line contacts to define at least one pair of sealed off fluid pockets. The fluid pockets move toward the center of the spiral wraps with consequent reduction of their volume by the orbital motion of the orbit ing scroll. The spiral wrap of each scroll has a transition portion between a higher inner portion of the spiral, and a lower outer portion thereof. The circular end plate of each scroll is provided with a stepped portion between a deeper inner portion of the end plate and a shallower outer portion thereof. The opposed transition and stepped portions are in registry, so that the higher spiral portions engage the deeper end plate portions, and the shorter spiral portions engage the shallower end plate portions.
