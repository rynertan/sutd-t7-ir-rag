# Improvements relating to the production of zeolite agglomerates.

## Abstract
Strengthened zeolite molecular sieve agglomerates are prepared by treating the agglomerates with an aqueous solution of a water soluble silicon compound and subse quently with an aqueous solution of a mineral acid of sufficient strength to decationise the molecular sieve and or increase its SiO₂ Al₂O₃ ratio. The strengthened agglomerates are suitable for use as catalyst supports.
