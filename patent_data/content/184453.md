# JOINT FOR ORTHOTIC DEVICE

## Abstract
A joint for an orthotic device comprises a first member 16 , a second member 17 pivotally mounted thereto and adjustable limit means 45,50 to limit relative pivotal movement between the first member 16 and second member 17 . A movable abutment part 35 may be provided having an inuse position in which the required limitation of pivotal movement is provided and another position in which greater angular movement is permitted. The joint has particular relevance to a hip guidance orthosis. The provision of additional pivotal movement beyond the normal limited movement enables a person wearing the orthotic device to sit down.
