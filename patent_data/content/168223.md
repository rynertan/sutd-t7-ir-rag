# Quick connect coupling.

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to a quick connect coupling including a tubular socket 10 or receptacle part having an internal groove 29 formed therein, a tubular nipple or insert part 11 having an external groove 28 formed thereon, and a snap ring 12 . The nipple 11 is insertable into the socket 10 and when so inserted the two grooves 28,29 are radially aligned. The snap ring 12 is mounted in and extends between the two grooves 28,29 to lock the socket 10 and the nipple 11 in assembled relation. Prior to final assembly, the snap ring 12 is positioned in the socket groove 28 , and in the space within the socket groove 28 and around the snap ring 12 is applied a relatively viscous fluid 46 . This fluid 46 which may be a grease, holds the snap ring 12 in the desired position in the groove 28 prior to and during assembly, and it also serves as a lubricant on the ring 12 which facilitates the assembly of the parts. The disclosure also describes the method of assembly of the coupling.
