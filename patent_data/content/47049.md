# Opacity monitoring apparatus.

## Abstract
An opacity monitor 10 includes a light source 12 mounted on one side of a duct 14 , and a detector 16 mounted on the opposite side of the duct. The light source 12 and the detector 16 are rotated by motor means 26, 36 , respectively, between a first position aligned with each other along an open light path defined across the duct 14 and a second position aligned with each other on opposite sides of a calibration tube 18 extending across the duct 14 . Shutters 28, 38 rotate with the light source 12 and the detector 16 , respectively, and are aligned with the calibra tion tube 18 when the light source 12 and the detector 16 are aligned with the open light path, and vice versa.
