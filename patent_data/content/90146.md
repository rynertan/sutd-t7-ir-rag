# Pluggable modular terminal.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a modular terminal comprising a frame 70 , a data distribution chamber 85 , a power distribution apparatus 90 and plural functional units 10, 11, 20, 21, 30, 50, 60 . The functional units are supported and oriented by the frame in such a way that each interconnects with the power distribution components. Functional units communicate via optical transmissions through the data distribution chamber. This allows a functional unit to be inserted, removed or moved from one frame location to another without special equipment or tools by unskilled personnel.
