# Web threading apparatus.

## Abstract
An automatic tape threading apparatus for a magnetic tape transport uses a pantograph mechanism 44 to deter mine the path 48 of a coupling pin 46 engageable with the leader block 18 on the free end of a tape 16 wound on a supply reel 14 in a replaceable cartridge 12 . The panto graph mechanism comprises a rotatable arm 54 mounted on the shaft 56 of a motor, a coupler guide arm 52 pivotally connected thereto, a follower arm 60 pivotally connected to the coupler guide arm and carrying a cam follower 64 , and a link 66 pivotally connecting the rotatable arm and the follower arm. The cam follower 64 is engaged in a cam groove in a cam plate 42, which forces the follower to describe a path 41 which represents the pin path 48 on a reduced scale. Rotating the rotatable arm causes the pin to follow the path in a sweeping motion past tape guides 30,31,34,36 and a transducer 32 into a take up reel 28 . This draws the tape out along a tape path 50 and connets it to the take up reel.
