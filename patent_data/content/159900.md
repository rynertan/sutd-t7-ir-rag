# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR INSERTING FLOW CONTROL MEANS INTO A WELL CASING

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for inserting flow control means into a well casing 10 is disclosed. A receptacle 22 having portions adapted to receive check valve means 20 is mounted within the well casing and the well casing is in serted into a well. The check valve means may be pumped down into engagement with the receptacle 22 to regulate the flow of fluid through the well casing. Alternatively, choke valve means may be pumped down into engagement with the receptacle instead of the check valve means. The choke valve means may be constructed having portions adapted to receive check valve means so that check valve means may be pumped down into engagement with said choke valve means to regulate the flow of fluid through the well casing.
