Compounds of the invention are tested for in vitro antimicrobial activity using standard testing procedures such as the determination of maximum inhibitory concentration MIC by agar dilution as described in Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically MF T Published January 1983 by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, 771 East Lancaster Avenue, Villanova, PA 19084. Briefly, MIC values are determined in unsupplemented Mueller Hinton Agar MHA . The compounds tested are diluted serially into molten MHA at 47 C. The agar is poured into petri dishes and allowed to harden. The various bacterium used for testing are grown overnight on MHA at 35 C and transferred to Tryptiease Soy Broth TSB until a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland standard is obtained. The bacterium are diluted one to twenty in TSB and inoculated on the plates 1 µl using a Steers replicator . The plates are incubated at 35 C for 20 hours and the MIC is read to be the lowest concentration of drug that completely inhibits visible growth of the bacterium. The MIC test results of two compounds of this invention are found in Table 1. The process for making compounds of Formula I is illustrated in Chart 1. In Chart 1 the starting compound IV, can be made by methods known in the art, i.e., .J. Am. Chem. Soc., 95 2401 2404 1973 or by the novel process illustrated in Chart 2, as will be described below. In step 1 of Chart 1, a compound of Formula IV is subjected to acylation to prepare a compound IIb. The general conditions for conducting this acylation are well known in the art. A preferred method involves reacting compound of Formula IV with the appropriate carboxylic acid in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 1 hydroxybenzotriazole and a catalytic amount of 4 dimethylaminopyridine. The reaction can be conducted at a temperature of about 0 30 C for a time of about 1 to 5 hours. The resulting compound of Formula IIb can be isolated from the reaction mixture by conventional means such as crystallization or chromatography and combinations thereof. Step 2 involves the introduction of a sulfo or alkylphosphonic acid residue on to the nitrogen atom at position 1 of the azetidinone ring IIb to yield a compound of Formula I. This is accomplished by reacting the compound with a sulfonating or phosphorylating agent. Depending on the desired final product, protecting groups well known in the art are optionally placed on sites subject to random sulfonation or phosphorylation. Protecting groups include t butoxycarbonyl, 9 fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl and phenylmethoxycarbonyl. A preferred manner of introducing the sulfono group is by reacting dimethylformamide sulfur trioxide with an optionally protected compound of Formula IIb in the presence of a solvent. The reaction can be conducted at a temperature of about 20 to 60 C for a time of about 1 to 5 hours. Preferred reaction temperature and reaction times are about 0 to 25 C and 1 to 3 hours, respectively. Solvents that can be used include dimethylformamide and methylene dichloride. The preferred solvent is dimethylformamide. The protected sulfonated compound is removed from the reaction mixture by conventional means, i.e., an extractive work up procedure and then deprotected to yield compounds of Formula I. Deprotection, when needed, can be accomplished by methods well known in the art such as treating the compound with an acid. The sulfonate compound I can be removed from the reaction mixture and further purified by methods well known in the art. The general methods of phosphorylation of azetidine rings are known. Koster, W.H. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 105 3743 1993 . A preferred method of phosphorylation is by treating the 2 azetidinone with an alkyllithium base typically n butyllithium followed by alkylphosphorochloridate typically methyl or n butyl phosphorochloridate at 78 C for 2 3 hours. The resulting dialkylphosphonate azetidinones are then dealkylated by methods known in the art. Gray, M.D.M. and Smith, D.J.H., Tet. Lett. 21 859 1980 . The preferred dealkylation is by treating the dialkylphosphonate azetidinones with thiourea in acetonitrite at reflux temperatures for 1 2 hours to obtain 2 azetidinone 1 phosphonic acid. Typical examples of phosphorylated azetidinones are cis 3 2 2 amino 4 thiazolyl Z 2 1 carboxymethoxy imino acetamido 4 N formylglycinoyl oxymethyl 2 oxy 1 azetidinemethylphosphonic acid potassium salt and cis 3 2 2 amino 4 thiazolyl Z 2 1 carboxymethoxy imino acetamido 4 N formylglycinoyloxymethyl 2 oxy 1 azetidine N butylphosphonic acid potassium salt. Compounds of Formula IV may be substituted at C 3 with X where X is hydrogen, methoxy or formylamino. Methods for introducing methoxy and formylamino substituents at C 3 of the β lactam ring are known in the art. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 95 2401 2404 1973 . As indicated above, some starting material utilised in the process illustrated in Chart 1, are prepared by the novel process illustrated in Chart 2 wherein R₁₂, R₁₃ and R₁₄ are independently selected from C₁ C₄ alkyl and phenyl . The starting compound III is known. J. Org. Chem., 47 2765 2767 1982 . It may be cis or trans with respect to the substituents on C 3 and C 4. It is recognised that alternative alkoxycarbonyls of from 1 5 carbon atoms, inclusive, or aralkoxycarbonyls of from 5 14 carbon atoms, inclusive, either unsubstituted or substituted by 1 4 groups of halogen, nitro, or C₁ C₄ alkyl could be used in place of the phenylmethoxycarbonyl group on compound III. In Step 1, the nitrogen at position 1 is protected by conversion to a compound of Formula IIc wherein R₁₂ R₁₄ have the meanings defined in Formula II. Silylation is the preferred protection method. Silylating agents well known in the art may be used. Typically, a trialkylsilyl chloride or an arylalkylsilyl chloride in the presence of an organic base is used. The reaction is conducted at a temperature of about 0 to 25 C for a period of about 1 to 5 hours in any of several anhydrous solvents, e.g. ethyl acetate, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, or dimethylformamide, in the presence of either an inorganic base or a tertiary amino such as trialkylamine or imidazole. A preferred solvent is dimethylformamide. Compounds of Formula IIc can be removed from the reaction mixture by conventional means such as crystallisation, filtration, chromatography and combinations thereof. The protected amino azetidinone IIc is reduced in Step 2 to give a compound of Formula IId. The reaction is conducted in the presence of a metal hydride at a temperature range of 0 C to room temperature for times of 2 to 5 hours. The preferred method is to treat compounds of Formula IIc with lithium borohydride in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran under cold conditions for several hours. Compounds of Formula IId can be obtained from the reaction mixture by conventional methods such as crystallisation or column chromatography, and combinations thereof. In Step 3, hydrogenolysis of the phenylmethoxycarbonyl substituent of compounds of Formula IId is carried out in the presence of palladium black or palladium on a support such as carbon under hydrogen gas to give compounds of Formula IIe. In step 4, amino compounds IIe are converted to amides of Formula IIf wherein R₂₀ has the meaning defined in Formula I. This conversion may be carried out by any of a number of amide or peptide forming reaction sequences such as described in Methoden der Organischem Chemie, Vierte Auflage, Band XV 2, E. Wunch ed., Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, p. 1. A preferred acylation process is the use of approximately molar quantities of a desired acid, 1 hydroxy benzotriazole, and a carbodiimide, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. There reagents are added to the solution of the amine in a solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, or acetonitrile. A temperature of 0 C 60 C is operative, with 20 35 C preferred. The time of reaction is variable from 0.5 24 hr being required, although usually 3 4 hr is sufficient. A precipitate of dicyclohexylurea is formed during the reaction. This is removed by filtration. The amides IIf are isolated from the filtrate by extractive procedures and chromatography. In step 5, the silyl group of compounds of Formula IIf are removed to yield compounds of Formula IIg IV which are compounds of Formula IV where X is hydrogen. Desilylation is accomplished by reacting compounds of Formula IIf with a fluoride ion in the presence of a solvent at a temperature of about 20 to 60 C for a time of about 1 to 12 hours. Preferred reaction temperature and times are about 0 to 25 C and 1 to 5 hours, respectively. Solvents that can be used include methylene dichloride, methanol, tetrahydrofuran and ethanol. The preferred method of conducting this step is to treat compounds of Formula IIf with triethylammonium fluoride in methanol. Compounds of Formula IIg IV are then used as starting material as illustrated in Chart I. Optically active isomers of the disclosed compounds are resolved by methods known in the art. Takeda European patent application 8310461 3. The resolving agents are any of the known resolving agents such as optically active camphorsulfonic acid, bis o toluoyltartaric acid, tartaric acid, and diacetyl tartaric acid which are commercially available and which are commonly used for resolution of amines bases , as for example in Organic Synthesis, Coll. Vol. V., p. 932 1978 , resolution of R and S α phenylethylamine with tartaric acid. Compounds of this invention are converted into optically active diastereomeric salts by reaction with an optically active acid in a manner standard in the isomer resolution art. The optically active acids include the resolving agents described above. These diastereomeric salts can then be separated by conventional means such as differential crystallization. Diastereomeric salts have different crystallization properties, which are taken advantage of in this separation. On neutralization of each diastereomeric salt with aqueous base in the corresponding optically active enantiomers of Formula I compound are obtained, each of which can subsequently and separately be converted as herein described to the desired salt. Preferably the separation of enantiomers is carried out by forming salts of optically active tartaric acid or derivatives thereof and taking advantage of the difference in solubility between the resulting diastereomers. Salt formation is carried out prior to acylation of the amino acid moiety at the C 4 position of the azetidinone ring. The preferred starting compound for making optically active compounds of Formula I, cis 1 2 ,4 dimethoxyphenyl methyl 4 methoxycarbonyl 3 phenylmethoxycarboxyamido 2 azetidinone, is known. Chem. Pharm. Bull., 32 2646 2659 1984 . The C 3 protecting group is removed by hydrogenolysis to the corresponding free amine. An appropriate substituted tartaric acid enantiomer is then added such as di p toluoyl D tartaric acid and reaction conditions altered to facilitate precipitation of the appropriate azetidinone diastereomeric salt. The tartaric acid is removed by treating the compound with inorganic base such as sodium bicarbonate to obtain C 3 free amino azetidinone. The compounds of Formula I are effective for treating bacterial infections in animals, including humans. Various compositions of the compounds of the present invention are presented for administration to humans and animals in unit dosage forms. The term unit dosage form , as used in the specification, refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and animals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired pharmaceutical effect in association with the required pharmaceutical diluent, carrier or vehicle. The specifications for the novel unit dosage forms of this invention are dictated by and directly dependent on a the unique characteristics of the active material and the particular effect to be achieved and b the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active material for use in humans and animals, as disclosed in detail in this specification, these being features of the present invention. Examples of suitable unit dosage forms in accord with this invention are tablets, capsules, pills, suppositories, powder packets, wafers, granules, cachets, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls, dropperfuls, ampoules, vials, aerosols with metered discharges, segregated multiples of any of the foregoing, and other forms as herein described. For oral administration, either solid or fluid unit dosage forms can be prepared. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the compounds of Formula I are mixed with conventional ingredients such as talc, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, magnesium aluminum silicate, calcium sulfate, starch, lactose, acacia, methylcellulose, and functionally similar materials as pharmaceutical diluents or carriers. Capsules are prepared by mixing the compound with an inert pharmaceutical diluent and filling the mixture into a hard gelatin capsule of appropriate size. Soft gelatin capsules are prepared by machine encapsulation of a slurry of the compound with an acceptable vegetable oil, light liquid petrolatum or other inert oil. Fluid unit dosage forms for oral administration such as syrups, elixirs, and suspensions can be prepared. The water soluble forms can be dissolved in an aqueous vehicle together with sugar, aromatic flavoring agents and preservatives to form a syrup. An elixir is prepared by using a hydroalcoholic ethanol vehicle with suitable sweeteners such as sugar and saccharin, together with an aromatic flavoring agent. Suspensions can be prepared with an aqueous vehicle with the aid of a suspending agent such as acacia, tragacanth, methylcellullose and the like. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the compound and a sterile vehicle, water being preferred. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions the compound can be dissolved in water for injection and filtered sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anesthetic, preservative and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. The dry lyophilized powder is then sealed in the vial and an accompanying vial of water for injection is supplied to reconstitute the liquid prior to use. Parenteral suspensions can be prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound can be sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound. Additionally, a rectal suppository can be employed to deliver the active compound. This dosage form is of particular interest where an animal cannot be treated conveniently by means of other dosage forms, such as orally or by insufflation, as in the case of young children or debilitated persons. The active compound can be incorporated into any of the known suppository bases by methods known in the art. Examples of such bases include cocoa butter, polyethylene glycols carbowaxes , polyethylene sorbitan monostearate, and mixtures of these with other compatible materials to modify the melting point or dissolution rate. These rectal suppositories can weigh from about 1 to 2.5 gm. An effective quantity of the compound is employed in treatment. The dosage of the compound for treatment depends on many factors that are well known to those skilled in the art. They include for example, the route of administration and the potency of the particular compound.

The reaction is complete in 2 hours. The precipitate solid is filtered off, washed with methylene dichloride 50 ml and the filtrate solution is stirred with aqueous sodium bicarbonate 1.89 g sodium bicarbonate in 40 ml water at room temperature for 15 minutes. The organic layer is taken, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is passed through the medium presure silica gel column eluting with 3 1 hexane ethylacetate followed by ethyl acetate to obtain 3.6 g of cis 3 2 2 t butoxycarbonylamino 4 thiazolyl Z 2 1 t butoxycarbonylmethoxy imino acetamido 4 N formylglycinoyl oxymethyl 2 azetidinone. Dimethylformamide sulfur trioxide complex solution 2.85 ml of 0.904 mole solution is added to a solution of cis 3 2 2 t butoxycarbonylamino 4 thiazolyl Z 2 1 t butoxycarbonylmethoxy imino acetamido 4 N formylglycinoyl oxymethyl 2 azetidinone 1.5 g, 2.56 mmole in dimethylformamide 5 ml at 0 C and stirred for one hour at that temperature. The ice bath is removed and it is allowed to stay at ambient temperature for an hour. When thin layer chromatography still shows starting material left, an additional 1 ml of dimethylformamide sulfur trioxide complex solution is added. After 45 minutes a small amount of starting material is still left but the reaction is quenched by adding aqueous potassium phosphate monobasic solution 690 mg potassium phosphate monobasic in 40 ml water and methylene dichloride 50 ml followed by tetra N butylammonium hydrogen sulfate 1.74 g .
