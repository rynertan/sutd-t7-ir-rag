# Process for preparing a polymerization catalyst and process for the production of ethylene polymers.

## Abstract
A catalyst composition formed from selected organo aluminum compounds and a precursor composition of the formula Mg A process for preparing such precursor composition by spray drying it from a slurry or solution in said electron donor compound, using atomization. A process for using said catalyst to readily prepare ethylene polymers having a density of about 0.91 to 0.97, a melt flow ratio of 22 to 32 and a bulk density of about 18 to 32 lbs ftÂ³ and controlled particle shape and size in a low pressure gas phase process at a productivity of 50,000 pounds of polymer per pound of Ti.
