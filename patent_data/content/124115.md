# Semiconducter ROM device and method for manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A read only memory ROM contains a conductive layer 16 of polysilicon which contacts the drains of memory cell MOS transistors and lies near and on a gate electrode. A data line 18 made of aluminium and the drain of the MOS transistors are interconnected through the conductive layer 16 . A method of manufacturing the ROM structure is also disclosed.
