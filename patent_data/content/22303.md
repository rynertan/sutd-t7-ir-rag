# ADJUSTABLE SLICING BLADE ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
An adjustable slicing blade assembly comprises basically a slicing or spacer disk having a centrally disclosed opening, a cylindrical flange extending from the under side of the spacer disk and surrounding the circular opening, and the rotatable shaft axially movable within the cylindrical flange and through the circular opening and having a slicing blade extending radially from its upper end. Appropriate mechanism is provided to rotate the spacer disk and the shaft in a given position with respect to each other. Associated with the shaft and cooperating with such locating mechanism is an arrangement for maintaining such given position and also varying the same and thereby the separation between the slicing blade and the spacer disk.
