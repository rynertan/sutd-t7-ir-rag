## Description
CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS This invention relates to thiadiazine derivatives, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as histamineH2 antagonists. Histamine, a physiologically active compound endogenous in mammals, exerts its action by interacting with certain sites called receptors. One type of receptor is known as a histamine Hl receptor Ash andSchild, Brit. J. Pharmac. Chemother. 27 427 1966 and the actions of histamine mediated through these receptors are blocked by drugs commonly called antihistamines histamine H1 antagonists a common example of which is mepyramine. A second type of histamine receptor is known as the H2 receptor Black et al. Nature 1972, 236, 385 . These receptors are not blocked by mepyramine but are blocked by burimamide. Compounds which block these histamine 2 receptors are called histamine H2antagonists. Histamine H2 antagonists are useful in treating disease conditions caused by the biological effects of histamine mediated through H2 receptors, for example, as inhibitors of gastric acid secretion, in the treatment of inflammation mediated through histamine H2 receptors and as agents which act on the cardiovascular system, for example, as inhibitors of effects of histamine on blood pressure mediated through histamine H2 receptors. Cimetidine is an example of a histamine H2antagonist. Cimetidine has been shown to be useful in the treatment of duodenal, gastric, recurrent and stomal ulceratXon, and reflux oesophagitis and in the management of patients who are at high risk from haemorrhage of the upper gastrointestinal tract. In some physiological conditions the biological actions of histamine are mediated through both histamineH1 and H2 receptors and blockade of both types of receptors is useful. These conditions include inflammation mediated by histamine, for example skin inflammation, and those hypersensitivity responses due to the action of histamine at H1 and H2 receptors, for example allergies. Accordingly the present invention provides compounds of the formula I EMI2.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, whereinR1 and R2 are independently hydrogen, C1 6alkyl, aryl C1 6 alkyl, heteroaryl C1 6 alkyl, C3 10cycloaikyl, hydroxy C2 6 alkyl, or halo C2 6 alkyl, wherein said hydroxy and halo groups are not substituted on the carbon atom adjacent to the nitrogen atom or R1 and R2 together represent CH2 q wherein q is 4 to 7, to form together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached a 5 8 membered saturated ring n is an integer from 1 to 6 Z is 1,3 phenylene, 1,4 phenylene, 2,4 pyridyl wherein the R1R2N CH2 n group is in the 4 position m is zero or one Y is oxygen, sulphur or methylene p is two, three or four andR3 and R4 are independently hydrogen, C1 6alkyl, aryl, aryl C1 6 alkyl or pyridyl C1 6 alkyl, or R3 andR together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached form a benzene ring optionally substituted by C16alkyl. When used herein alkyl means groups that are either straight chained or branched. In general preferred alkyl groups are methyl and ethyl. Suitably in the definitions of R1, R2, R3 and R4 aryl is phenyl, aryl C16 alkyl is phenyl C1 6 alkyl and heteroaryl C1 6 alkyl is furanyl C1 6 alkyl or thienyl C1 alkyl. Suitably R1 is aryl C16 alkyl for example benzyl or phenethyl, heteroaryl C1 6 alkyl for example furanyl C16 alkyl such as furanylmethyl or thienyl C1 6 alkyl such as thienylmethyl, halo C2 6 alkyl for example 2,2,2 trifluoroethyl, or C cycloalkyl for example 3 19 cyclohexyl. More suitably R is C1 6alkyl, for example methyl, ethyl or propyl. Suitably R2 is hydrogen or Cl 6alkyl, for example methyl, ethyl or propyl. Suitably R1 and R2 have the same value, for example they both are methyl or they are both ethyl.In another suitable aspect R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a pyrrolidino or piperidino ring. Preferably n is one. Suitably Z is 1,3 phenylene. Suitably Z is 2,4pyridyl. Favourably when Z is 1,3 phenylene, m is zero and preferably Y is oxygen. Favourably when Z is 2,4pyridyl m is one and preferably Y is sulphur. In an alternative favourable aspect when Z is 2,4 pyridyl, m is zero and preferably Y is oxygen. Suitably m and p when added together equals three, that is suitably p is two when m is one, and suitably p is three when m is zero. Examples of favoured groupsR1R2N CH2 n Z CH2 m Y CH2 p p CH2 p 4 dimethylaminomethylpyr id 2 ylmethylthioethyl, 4 piperidinomethylpyr id 2 ylmethylthioethyl, 4 dimethylaminomethylpyr id 2 yloxypropyl, 4 piperidinomethylpyrid 2 yloxypropyl, 3 dimethylaminomethylphenoxypropyl, 3 piperidinomethylphenoxypropyl, 3 dimethylaminomethylphenylmethylthioethyl or 3 piperidinomethylphenylmethylthioethyl.

The compounds of the formula I are depicted in the 4 H tautomeric form, and exist in equilibrium with the 2 H tautomeric form and the tautomeric form with an exocyclic double bondEMI5.1 The present application covers all isomeric and tautomeric forms, and mixtures thereof, of the compounds of the formula I . Specific compounds of this invention include 3 3 3 piperidinomethyl phenoxy propylamino 5,6 dihydro 1,2,4 thiadiazine l,l dioxide and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof 3 3 3 piperidinomethyl phenoxy propylamino l,2,4 benzo thiadiazine l,l dioxide and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof 3 3 4 dimethylaminomethyl3pyrid 2 yloxy propylamino 1,2,4 benzothiadiazine l,l dioxide and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof 3 E3 4 piperidinomethyl3pyrid 2 yloxy propylamino 1,2,4 benzothiadiazine l,l dioxide and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof 3 3 4 piperidinomethyl pyrid 2 yloxy propylamíno 5,6 dihydro 1,2,4 thiadiazine 1,l dioxide and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof 3 2 4 dimethylaminomethyl pyrid 2 ylmethylthio ethyl amino 1,2,4 benzothiadiazine 1,1 dioxide and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and 3 2 4 dimethylaminomethyl pyrid 2 ylmethylthio ethyl amino 5,6 dihydro l,2,4 thiadiazine l,l dioxide and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The activity of the compounds of formula I as histamine H2 antagonists can be demonstrated by their ability to inhibit histamine stimulated secretion of gastric acid from the lumen perfused stomachs of rats anaesthetised with urethane, and to reverse histamineinduced inhibition of contractions of the isolated rat uterus. These are actions of histamine which, according to Ash and Schild, Bait. J. Pharmac. Chemother. 27 247 1966 , are not mediated by histamine H1 receptors. The histamine H2 antagonist activity of the compounds can also be demonstrated by the inhibition of histaminestimulated acid secretion in the Heidenhain Pouch Dog, the inhibition of histamine induced tachycardia in the isolated guinea pig right atrium and the inhibition of histamineinduced vasodilatation in the anaesthetised cat. The measurement of inhibition of histamine stimulated secretion of gastric acid from the lumen perfused stomachs of rats anaesthetised with urethane, and the measurement of inhibition of histamine induced tachycardia in the isolated guinea pig right atrium, are detailed inEuropean Patent Application Publication No 49173. To illustrate the level of activity of the compounds of the invention we have determined that where tested the products of the Examples have ED50 values in the lumenperfused rat test of less than one micromol kg 1 i.v. and pA2 values in the guinea pig atrium test of more than six. In order to use compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for medical purposes, they are normally formulated in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice as pharmaceutical compositions. The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formula I above or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be administered orally, parenterally, cutaneously or rectally. Compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts which are active when given orally can be formulated as syrups, tablets, capsules and lozenges.A syrup formulation will generally consist of a suspension or solution of the compound or salt in a suitable liquid carrier for example, ethanol, glycerine or water with a flavouring or colouring agent. Where the composition is in the form of a tablet, any suitable pharmaceutical carrier routinely used for preparing solid formulations may be used. Examples of such carriers include magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, sucrose and cellulose. Typical parenteral compositions consist of a solution or suspension of the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in a sterile aqueous carrier or parenterally acceptable oil. Typical compositions for administration to the skin include lotions and creams in which the compound of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is contained in a liquid vehicle. A typical suppository formulation comprises a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof which is active when administered in this way, with a binding and or lubricating agent such as gelatin or cocoa butter or other low melting vegetable waxes or fats. Preferably the composition is in unit dose form such as a tablet or capsule so that the patient may administer to himself a single dose. Each dosage unit for oral administration contains preferably from 15 to 250 mg and for parenteral administration contains preferably 0.5 to 25 mg of a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof calculated as the free base. The invention also provides a method of blocking histamine H2 receptors which comprises administering to an animal an effective amount to block said receptors of a compound of the formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention will normally be administered to a subject for the treatment of peptic ulcers and other conditions caused or exacerbated by gastric acidity in the same general manner as that employed for known histamine H2 antagonists, due allowance being made in terms of dose levels for the potency of the compound of the present invention relative to known histamine H2 antagonists. Thus an adult patient will receive an oral dose of between 15 mg and 1500 mg and preferably between 20 mg and 250 mg or an intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular dose of between 0.5 mg and 150 mg, and preferably between 1.0 mg and 20 mg of compound of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof calculated as the free base, the composition being administered 1 to 6 times per day. In a further aspect of this invention the compounds of the formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be prepared by a process which comprises a reacting a compound of the formula II with a compound of the formula III R1R2N CH2 n Z CH2 m Y CH2 p NH2 II EMI9.1 wherein R1 R2 R3 R4 Z, V, m n and p are as hereinbefore defined, and Q is a group displaceable by amine or b reducing a compound of the formula IV or V EMI9.2 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, Z, V, n, m and p are as hereinbefore defined, R5 is a precursor of a group R1R2N CH2 n as hereinbefore defined and R6is a group CONH or CH N or c for preparing compounds wherein Z is phenylene, m is zero and Y is oxygen, reacting a compound of the formula VI or chemical equivalent thereof with a compound of the formula VII EMI10.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, n and p are as hereinbefore 1. defined, and Q1 is a moiety displaceable by phenol or chemical equivalent thereof or d for preparing compounds wherein m is one and Y is sulphur, reacting a compound of the formula VIII or chemical equivalent thereof with a compound of the formula IX RlR2N CH2 n Z CH2SH VIII EMI10.2 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, Z, n and p are as hereinbefore defined, and Q2 is a moiety displaceable by thiol or chemical equivalent thereof or e for preparing compounds wherein m is one and Y is sulphur, reacting a compound of the formula X with a compound of the formula XI or chemical equivalent thereof R1R2N CH2 n Z CH2 Q3 Q X EMI11.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, n, Z and p are as hereinbefore defined, and Q3 is a moiety displaceable by thiol or chemical equivalent thereof or f for preparing compounds wherein R3 and R4 together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached form a benzene ring optionally substituted by Cl 6alkyl, cyclizing a compound of the formula XII EMI11.2 wherein R1, R2, n, Z, m, Y and p are as hereinbefore defined, R is hydrogen or Cl 6alkyl, and Q4 is a moiety displaceable by amine and optionally thereafter forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Suitably Q is C1 6alkylthio, benzylthio, chloro or bromo. Favourably Q is methylthio.

When Q3 is an arylsulphonyloxy or alkylsulphonyloxy group the reaction is preferably performed under mildly basic conditions for example in pyridine solution. The cyclisation of a compound of the formula XII is suitably performed in an organic solvent. Suitably 4.Q is a Cl 4alkylthio group for example methylthio. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the formula I may be prepared from the corresponding base of the compounds of the formula I in conventional manner. For example the base may be reacted with an acid in a Cl qalkanol, or an ion exchange resin may be used. The salts of the compounds of the formula I may be interconverted using ion exchange resins.Non pharmaceutically acceptable salts are therefore of use as they can be converted to pharmaceutically acceptable salts.
