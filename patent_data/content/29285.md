# Fast crystallising block copolyester composition.

## Abstract
A fast crystallising polyester composition comprising a block copolyester containing the repeating polymeric seg ments A and B wherein A is a polymeric segment of ethylene terephthalate units and B is a polymeric segment having a glass transition temperature of less than 0 C and preferably less than 20 C, the concentration of the segments of B being between 0.05 and 10 mole of the block copolyester, and a crystallisation nucleant which is an at least partially neutralised salt, preferably an alkali metal salt, of a polymer containing pendant neutralisable groups.
