# A differential signal receiver.

## Abstract
A differential signal receiver comprising a differential am plifier 15, 16, 17, 18, 23 for comparing differential voltages of differential input signals Vi₁, Vi₂ with a threshold voltage Va, Vb , to provide logical output signals includes an emitter follower 19, 21 and an impedance means 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 . The outputs of the emitter followers 19, 21 are superimposed through the impedance means 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 on the differential input signals Vi₁, Vi₂ so that the threshold voltage is variable and is controlled by controlling the input voltage Ve, Vf of the emitter follower 19, 21 . This differential signal receiver has the advan tage that a constant 1 or 0 level output signal is generated for a zero input signal and so provides a signal receiver having a high noise tolerance.
