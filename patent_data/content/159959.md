# Method for recovering denitrating catalyst for ammonia catalytic reduction.

## Abstract
A method for recovering a denitrating catalyst for ammonia catalytic reduction which is characterized by treat ing the denitrating catalyst for ammonia catalytic reduction, in which a performance has deteriorated, with at least one selected from the group consisting of SO₄² compounds, sul fur compounds and sulfonic acid compounds in order to re plenish the catalyst with a sulfur content.
