# Silver halide color photographic material and method of processing the same.

## Abstract
A quick desilvering process of silver halide color photo graphic materials is provided, wherein the total amount of coated silver is 5.2 g mÂ² or less, an average iodide content in the whole light sensitive silver halide grains is 5.5 mol or less and a 2 equivalent magenta polymer coupler is included as a magenta coupler, and bleach fixing treatment, or bleaching treatment at a pH of 5.5 or less, or desilvering treatment in the presence of a specific desilvering accelerator is carried out. Silver halide color photographic materials which permit the quick desilvering are also provided. These contain a specific desilvering accelerator.
