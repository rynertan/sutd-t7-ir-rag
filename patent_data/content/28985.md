# A method for making fasteners by drawing a cold wire or rod.

## Abstract
The invention deals with a method for making fasteners by drawing a cold wire or rod. The method aocording to the invention for making a fast ener having a head and a shank horn wire or rod consisting essentially of AISI 200 or 300 series stainless steel comprises the following steps a cooling the wire or rod to a temperature of less than about minus 75 C b drawing the cold wire or rod through a die at a strain sufficient to provide a tensile strength for the wire or rod in the range of about 517 MPa to about 1,104 MPa, the strain and the die size being such that the area of the wire or rod will be reduced by at least about 3 percent and c dividing the wire or rod into slugs and cold heading each slug to provide the fastener.
