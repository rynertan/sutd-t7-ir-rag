# Portable unit of self sufficient habitable equipment with built in multifunctional furnishings for various kinds of location.

## Abstract
Support modules, work boards or tops , connectors and packaging constitute the essential parts of the invention, which consists of realizing a system or set of pieces that, when mounted and assembled, offer a person the possibility of having a bed, a table, some chairs, shelter from the natural environment, and a corner for his personal needs. The originality of the invention does not lie in the parts as such, but rather in the whole, which is readily portable as that term is understood in the light of the geometric and physical possibilities of a person of average body stature . Optional accessories can further enhance the invention and make it compatible with the logistic needs of groups of people. Figure No. 1 illustrates the essence of the invention, whose realization calls for an industrial type of manufacture.

## Description
Translation Industrial invention by David William DavenportTitle Portable unit of self sufficientEMI1.1 equipment withEMI1.2 multifunctional furnishings for various kinds of locations.EMI1.3 The words portable unit are here to be understood as referring to a set of pieces of a modular struc ture that permit the composition of fundamental it ms of furniture and all capable of being contain ed in a small suitcase of such size and weight as to enable a person of normal stature to carry it either by hand or in a rucksack on his back. SeeDrawing No.1 Figure 1. Descri tion of the pieces of the invention a supporting boards of a modular structure made of metal or plastic material or wood b Working boards or tops of metal, plastic material or wood c She ts of natural and or synthetic fibres or m tal mesh or rubberized tissue d a system of connectors for assembling the various pieces with screws, springs, large springs, friction coupling , and other types of joints.All these pieces, packed side by side, amke the unit portable. With these pieces it is possible to compose any of the following basic items of furniture 1 A bed as shown in Figure No.2 of Drawing No.2. The bed consists of a certain number of su ort mod ules for a sheet to be hooked to them. The internal perimeter of one of these modules is indicated inFigure No.2 of Drawing No.2 with the letters ABCD. The sheet on which the person settles down to rest or sleep is indicated with the letters FHMR. Figure No.1 of Drawing No.1 shows an open view of the suit case to illustrate how the upport modules are ar ranged side by side inside it. 2 A hammock as shown in Figure No.3 of Drawing No.3. The sheet, indicated by the letters FHMR, can be seen hooked by means of the usual adequate systems to two support modules, whose external perimeter is indicated by the letters XYZT. 3 A wardrobe as shown in Figure No.4 of Drawing No.4, where one can see both su port modules and work boards, one of which is indicated by the letters NPSK. These work boards constitute the back wall of the wardrobe. The elements like the one indicated by the letters LQE form part of the socalled con nectors referred to in paragraph d above.4 A large table as shown in Figure No.5 of Drawing No.5. The part shown entirely in black indicates the table top and is realized by assembling several modules of the type indicated by the letters PSK in Figure No.4 of Drawing No.4.5 Two small tables as shown in Figures Nos.6 and 7 of Drawing No.6, where one can see the support mod ules like the one indicated by the letters XYZT and the work boards like the one indicated by the let ters NPSK.6 A miniature table even smaller than those indi cated in paragraphs 4 and 5 above, all as shown in Figure No.8 of Drawing No.7, where the work board or top is indicated by the letters ILWE.7 A chair like the one shown in Figure No.9 of Drawing No.7. The chair consists of su port modules like the one indicated by the letters XYZT and a sheet on which one can sit, indicated by the letters GOUV. The su port modules, work board, sheets and connector systems permit one to choose between a bed and a hammock, between a large table and small tables, between one, two or more chairs, between a large wardrobe and two small ones, and so on, providing an W DE range of alternative choices according to he functions desired or according to the environment in which one finds oneself. Since a single person can carry two and even three equipment units, it follows that it is possible to use one of the sheets as the carrying structure of the bed and the other over to provide shelter. Analogously, the wardrobe may constitute a shower cubicle or a retreat or hygienic functions.On the work boards it is possible to constitute reflecting surfaces for mirrors, absorbing surfaces for solar energy, or to provide electric installations for lighting or cookers. Likewise, the suitcase can be proyided not on ly in the rucksack version, but also in a form suitable for parachute drops. The bed itself may act either as a stretcher or a hammock. Some pieces of chord not shown on the drawings attached hereto and some small tools, appropriately packed, constitute the accessories of the portable unit.The invention under consideration consists essentially of having organically and integrally applied the presentEMI4.1 of odular construction technique and the present EMI4.2 of packaging technique to the field of emer gency HABITAB E structures, the needs of civil de fence and the operational requirements of mobile par ties or detachments, be they military or civil, pub lic or private, h manitarian or scientific, or for tourist or commercial purposes. The originality of the invention is therefore to be found in the conception of a portable unit of HAB1 TABLE equipment that confers a considerable degree of self sufficiency upon both individuals and groups as regards the elementary functions of sleeping, eat ing, personal hygiene and transport of articles of use in zones characterized by a wide range of differ ent environments. The invention, as it were, seeks to imitate nature, which has provided snails and tortoises with portable houses. The idea generates an industrial invention rather than a useful model for the simple reason that it is destined not only to be reproduced on a mass production scale, but also because it implies a type of sophisticated fabrication or manufacture inasmuch as it is light and yet strong and incorporates acces ories of a type analogous to printed electronic circuits and inasmuch as it foreshadows new industrial manufac turing techniques in sten with the most advanced and most recent technological developments.
