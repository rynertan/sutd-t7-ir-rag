# Steering handle for luggage case.

## Abstract
A luggage case is provided with a steering handle 15 for steering the case when it is being rolled on the ground. The handle 15 is pivoted to the case shell 19 by means of a pivot pin 20 for movement between a closed position in which the handle 15 lies adjacent the shell 19 and an extended position in which the handle projects from the shell. Movement of the handle 15 away from the closed position is limited by means of a stay 23 connected be tween the case shell 19 and a position on the steering handle 15 spaced from the pivot pin 20 towards the free end of the handle 15 . The stay 23 is of resilient flexible material. The base moulding 17 of the handle is provided with a projection 32 which holds the stay 23 in a flexed condition when the handle 15 is in the closed position so that the stay 23 exerts a force on the handle tending to hold the handle 15 in the closed position. Thus, the need for a separate spring to hold the handle in the closed position is avoided.
