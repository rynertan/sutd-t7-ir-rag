## Description
TRIS 3 HYDROXYALKYL PHOSPHINE OXIDE FLAME RETARDANTCOMPOSITIONS The present invention relates to thermoplastic polyamide polymers which are rendered flame retardant by having combined therewith an effective amount of a tris 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide. The polyamide nylon 6 6 was one of the first engineering thermoplastics, so called because of its highly rated mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties to which standard metal design methodology could be applied to yield parts having predictable short and long term performance characteristics. Since 1955 other polyamides, i.e., nylon 6, 6 6, 6 10, 6 12, 6 9, 11, 12 and copolymers like 6 66 have been introduced.However, nylon 6 6 and 6 have always dominated the polyamide market and account for the majority of nylons used as engineering thermoplastics. With the current and future federal requirements obligating automotive manufacturers to improve the efficiency of their product and reduce fuel consumption, there is a substantial growth in the use of engineering plastics as a replacement for metal to achieve weight reduction. At the present time, nylon is the dominant engineering thermoplastics for transportation end uses. Polyamides such as thermoplastic nylons, are in general, characterized as being relatively stable thermally upon long exposure to processing temperatures and shear. Upon exposure to flame, however, they burn quite readily. The flammability is characterized by dripping behavior of the burning nylons. There is a substantial and increasing demand for flame retardant nylon. To meet flame retardant requirements, nylon is customarily compounded with flame retardant additives, i.e., organic halogen compounds plus antimony oxide the most often used combination being 17 208 of a poly chloro bicyclic hydrocarbon plus 5 antimony trioxide.Sometimes iron oxide is used with the organohalogen compound. Red phosphorus has also been used as a flame retardant for nylon. Such additives, however, frequently degrade or cause degradation under processing conditions extrusion at about 250 C resulting in poor mechanical performance of the thermoplastic nylons themselves. The known flame retardants for nylon such as haloalkyl phosphates, suffer generally from one or more deficiencies including low compatibility, low thermal stability or poor fire retardant behavior in molded nylon components. Additionally, a serious problem posed by organohalogen flame retardants in nylon is attributable to acid formation, either due to or arising from light exposure or thermal degradation with the released acid then attacking metal components in end use applications. Some organohalogen compounds are contraindicated as fire retardant additives due to toxicity problems of the compound, i.e., mutagenicity. In accordance with the present invention the addition of a small but effective amount of one or more tris 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide having the formula EMI2.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are any radical selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, phenyl and alkyl radicals of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and n may be 1, 2, or 3, to a thermoplastic polyamide substantially improves the flame retardant properties of the polyamide. The addition of a tris 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphi ne oxide to the polyamide in the amount required to improve flame retardant properties does not adversely modify the physical properties of the polyamide to a point where its commercial use is impaired. The tris 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxides described above are readily compatible with the polyamide and effective when added in small quantities, i.e., 10 25 parts per hundred.Particularly preferred compositions are flame retardant nylon molding resins to which have been added from about 14 to about 21 parts per hundred of a tris 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide. The flame resistant polyamide tris 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide blends of the present invention are particularly advantageous for use in the internal circuitry of appliances, business machines, terminal strips, connectors and blocks. The tris 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxides of the present invention are more soluble in water than in polar organic solvents such as chloroform. Such tris 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxides combine high compatibility in polyamides with high thermal stability and excellent fire retardant efficiency either alone or in combination with organohalogen products. The addition of a tris 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide to polyamide such as the various polyamides referred to above, improves mixing parameters and reduces polymer degradation by lowering the processing temperature of the polyamide. Although the present invention is not to be limited by any theoretical assumption, it is believed that one possible mechanism by which tris 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide imparts flame resistance is by reaction of the hydroxyl groups upon pyrolysis with the amide linkages in the polymer chain to yield a very tough crosslinked foamed and thermally insulating char, which supresses further resin pyrolysis at the flame front and also eliminates the dripping behavior of the polymer under combustion conditions.The merits that may be attributed to such tris 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide flame retardant relative to conventional flame retardant agents in present use include no corrosion, high ultraviolet stability, non toxicity and minimal adverse change in the physical properties of the polymer. In addition to providing fire resistance to molded polyamide parts, the tris 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxides may also be present in nylon fibers making them flame retardant, more resistant to dirt and static build up and rendering the fibers less hydrophobic, thereby improving the wearability. Flame retardant treatments for conventional nylon fabrics are seldom used in practice suggesting the lack of effective treatments for nylon fabrics. The addition of tris 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxides to nylon to be used in the manufacture of floor covers is particularly advantageous. Tris 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide may be prepared by first reacting a 3 hydroxy 1,2 unsaturated olefin such as 1 butene 3 ol or 2 butene 3 ol with phosphine in the presence of a free radical catalyst as described in United States Patent No. 3,489,811. We have discovered that the use of stoichiometric quantities of reactants or as little as 4 excess alcohol reduce the formation of higher molecular weight byproducts. The tris 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine obtained by this process is readily converted to the corresponding phosphine oxide by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide. Phosphine oxides having different 3 hydroxyalkyl groups on the phosphorus atom such as EMI4.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are any radical selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, phenyl and alkyl radicals of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and n is either 1, 2, or 3, may be prepared by reacting phosphine with a mixture of allyl alcohol and an alcohol having the formula EMI4.2 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are any radical selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, phenyl and alkyl radicals of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and oxidizing the resulting product. These mixed phosphine oxides as well as physical mixtures of such mixed phosphine oxides with tris hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxides such as tris 3hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide and or tris 3 hydroxy2 methylpropyl phosphine oxide are useful additives having application in the present invention.Particularly preferred alcohols are allyl alcohol and methallyl alcohol. When a mixture of allyl alcohol and methallyl alcohol are reacted with phosphine and the resulting product oxidized such mixed phosphine oxides are more volatile than the tris 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide. The relative volatility of this series of compounds rate of vaporization by thermogravimetric technique in order of increasing volatility is tris 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide, bis 3 hydroxypropyl 2 methyl 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide, tris 2 methyl3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide and 3 hydroxypropyl bis 2 methyl 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide. These mixed phosphine oxides as well as physical mixtures of such mixed phosphine oxides with tris 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide and or tris 2 methylpropyl phosphine oxide are useful additives having application in the present invention. As indicated above, the less common hydroxy olefins may be reacted with phosphine to form a 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine that may be oxidized to the corresponding phosphine oxide. Examples are 2 butene 1 ol, 1butene 3 ol, 2 heptene 1 ol, cinnamyl alcohol, 2 butyl 2 propene 1 ol butene 2 diol 1,4 and 2 hydroxymethylpropene 1 ol 3. The resulting products, are more costly to manufacture and have the disadvantage of containing less phosphorus than the preferred additives of the present invention. The following examples will more fully illustrate the invention. Example 1 Preparation of Tris 3 Hydroxypropyl Phosphine Oxide Tris 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine is prepared by the method described in Example 1 of Patent No.3,489,811. Into a one liter pressure reactor is placed 307 g 5.3 moles allyl alcohol and 20 ml of a solution containing 3 g azobisisobutyronitrile dissolved in 100 ml of allyl alcohol. The pressure reactor is closed and charged with 36 g 1.06 moles of phosphine. The reaction mixture is agitated by rocking the reactor for two hours at 800C. The reaction mixture is permitted to cool to room temperature and the pressure vessel is vented in a hood to release any unreacted phosphine. An additional 20 ml of the azobisisobutyronitrile solution described above is added to the reactor which is closed and the system is again heated to 80 C and rocked for one hour.The addition of 20 ml of the azobisisobutyronitrile solution is repeated with intermediate agitation at 80 C for one hour under pressure until all of the azobisisobutyronitrile solution 100 ml has been added.The contents of the reactor are then heated to 800C under pressure and rocked for an additional five hours. The yellow solution that results from the above reaction is vacuum distilled by heating to about 85 C 1 mm Hg and maintaining at that temperature and pressure for about four hours to remove volatiles mono , and bis 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine and unreacted allyl alcohol. The residue remaining in the distillation pot is a clear yellow syrup weighing 184 g. This non volatile yellow syrup is dissolved in an equal volume of a 50 50 mixture of isopropanol methanol and oxidized by stirring with the dropwise addition of a 30 aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution diluted with an equal volume of isopropanol. When the exothermic reaction subsides, the solution of phosphine oxide is tested by adding one drop of the solution to 1 ml of carbon do sulfide until no red coloration can be detected visually in the carbon disulfide layer. This indicates complete oxidation of the phosphine to tris 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide. Following oxidation with hydrogen peroxide, the solvents water, isopropanol and methanol are removed from the reaction product by heating to 650C under vacuum. The viscous yellow slush which remains is filtered through a Buchner Funnel to collect 42.4 grams of a white solid that is insoluble in isopropanol at room temperature. The yield, based on the phosphine used is 17.8 . After washing with isopropanol and air drying, the white solid analyzes for tris 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide.

The results are reported in Table I. Example 2 Preparation of Tris 3 Hydroxypropyl Phosphine Oxide Example 1 above is repeated using a smaller amount of allyl alcohol 4.1 excess . Four hundred and fifty grams 13.23 moles phosphine is reacted with 2,400 g 41.33 moles of allyl alcohol in the presence of 30 g azobisisobutyronitrile over a period of nine hours.The temperature varies over a range of 25 C 170 C and the pressure over a range of 600 psig to 60 psig. The reaction product is heated to 1700C at 10 mm Hg pressure to remove volatiles and the residue is oxidized with hydrogen peroxide 11.90 moles over two hours at a temperature up to 104 C. The solvents are removed by heating to 65 C under vacuum. The residue 2,737 g, 92.25 yield solidifies at room temperature to form an off white solid. This product analyzes for tris 3hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide. Found Theory C 48.41 C 48.2 H 9.28 H 9.38 P 13.3 P 13.84 Example 3 Preparation of Tris 3 Hydroxy 2 Methylpropyl Phos phine Oxide Tris 3 hydroxy 2 methylpropyl phosphine is prepared by the method described in Example 1 above. Into a four liter pressure reactor equipped with a stirrer and thermometer is placed 690 g 9.6 moles of methallyl alcohol and 40 ml of a solution containing 9 g azobisisobutyronitrile dissolved in 900 ml of toluene. The pressure reactor is closed and charged with 96 g 2.8 moles of phosphine. The reaction mixture is heated with stirring to 60 C at which temperature the reaction becomes exothermic and the temperature rises to 107 C. Stirring is continued as the temperature subsides from 107 C to 90 C and the pressure drops from 100 psig to 50 psig. The temperature is maintained at 90 C with heating and stirring for one hour at which time 50 ml of the azobisisobutyronitrile solution in toluene is pumped into the reactor. The reaction mixture is maintained at 90 C for one hour with stirring after the second addition of catalyst. The addition of 50 ml of the azobisisobutyronitrile solution is repeated with continuous stirring at 90 C each hour until all of the azobisisobutyronitrile solution 200 moles has been added. The contents of the reactor are then stirred while maintaining the temperature at 90 C for an additional four hours. After the last addition of catalyst solution, the pressure in the reaction vessel has dropped to 0 psig. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, removed from the reaction vessel and heated up to 35 C at 2 mm Hg to distill off the volatile components toluene, methallyl alcohol, mono , and bis addition products . The non volatile colorless liquid residue tris 3 hydroxy 2 methylpropyl phosphine weighs 614.7 g.It is dissolved in an equal volume of isopropanol and chilled on ice. The phosphine present in solution is oxidized by the dropwise addition with stirring of a 30 aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution diluted with an equal volume of isopropanol. Inasmuch as the oxidation reaction is exothermic, the course of the reaction may be followed by the temperature increase upon addition of hydrogen peroxide.When the exotherm subsides, a small aliquot of the reaction mixture is tested after each addition of hydrogen peroxide with hydrogen peroxide test paper and by addition of a few drops of the reaction mixture to 1 cc of carbon di sulfide. At the end of the oxidation reaction, the observed red color of the carbon do sulfide indicative of unoxidized phosphine, disappears and the hydrogen peroxide test paper indicates the presence of hydrogen peroxide. When the oxidation of the phosphine to phosphine oxide has been completed, the water and isopropanol are removed from the phosphine oxide by heating to 65 C at 2 mm Hg until all volatiles have distilled off. The residue, a clear colorless viscous liquid, weighs 633.5 g and has the following analyses Found Theory C 54.59 C 54.14 H 9.35 H 10.15 P 11.1 P 11.65 The theory value is calculated for tris 3 hydroxy2 methylpropyl phosphine oxide. This compound is effective in improving the flame retardance of nylon.
