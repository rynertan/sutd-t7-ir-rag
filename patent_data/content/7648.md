Process for the obtention of new acylureas with pharmacol ogical activity, of the general formula I as defined in Claim 2. characterized because in the event that the compound of starting III be an acid halyde one may alternatively use an acid catalyst as for example concentrated sulphuric acid in the reaction of the obtention of the acylurea of the general formula IV. in which R is the same as in I and III, which acylureas IV, once isolated are used as the acid component for the obtention of the acylureas I, in a reaction of amino methylation with morpholine and a suitable form of formaldehyde formaline, trioxymethylene, or paraformaldehyde , carried out in a suitable solvent. The procedure for obtaining the acylureas of the general formula I is the following Stage a. Obtention of the acylurea of the general formula IV. Add slowly the activated form III on to a continuously stirred suspension of urea in a non alcoholic organic solvent inert to reagents, as for example benzene, tuolene, xylene, pyridine, a chlorohydrocarbon derivative, etc. When . III is an acid halide, an acid catalyst can be used alternatively, as for example concentrated sulphuric acid, or basis, as for example pyridine or tri ethylamine, in which case it is appropriate to use a quantity of at least the stoichiometric with respect to III, which acts as the acceptor of the hydrogen halide given off in the reaction. The selection of the reaction temperature is not critical as the process can take place between ambient and the solvent boiling point, the latter being preferable so as to accelerate the rate of reaction. The stirring and the heating is kept up for a period varying from 1 to 24 hours after which the solution is allowed to cool at rest. A crystaline precipitate is obtained which is washëd with the same solvent used in the reaction, followed with a solution of sodium bicarbonate then finally with water, thus obtaining the intermediate acylurea of the general formula IV. Stage b. Obtention of the acylurea of the general formula I. The acylarea thus obtained is made to react with morpholine and formaldehyde in a solvent of which the polarity is not critical, such that one can use water, acetic acid, dioxane, an alcohol such as ethanol or isoamylic alcohol or mixtures in varying proportions of these solvents the medium can be slightly acid, neutral or basic and being preferably solvents with lower boiling points. Formaldehyde may be used, either in the form of an aqueous solution, preferably in a concentration between 35 and 40 So formaline or in the form of trioxymethylene in which case the medium must be slightly acid and the reaction times extended or in the form of paraformaldehyde polyoxymethylene in any of its forms. The mixture of acylurea IV, morpholine, formaldehyde and the solvent is taken to the boil and is so kept during a period varying between 1 and 24 hours. The product is isolated either by crystalization and filtration of the cold crude from the reaction or by precipitation followed by filtration of the crude poured onto an excess of water. The product so obtained, of a richness approximating to 900 is purified by obtaining the corresponding hydrochlori de for this one disolves in an organic solvent such as alcohol, dioxane, or a hydrochloride derivative and causes to bubble,a stream of hydrogen chloride across the organic solution until total precipitation1 or one adds a stoechiznwetric quantity of concentrated hydric chloride acid to the said solution.

The results obtained using clofibrate . ethyl esther of p chlorophenox yisobutiric acid , as a reference standard are shown in Table II below. For this hypercholesterolaemia activity, among the products examined, that with the reference ITA 375 stands out for its efficacity.For the determination of the hyperlipaemia activity the products were administered orally suspended in 10 ml kg of olive oil ,evaluating the lactescence of the serum 6 hours after administration. The results obtained against clofibrate are also shown in Table II below,..As may be observed the products sunder reference ITA 375 and ITA 378 stand out in this activity.
