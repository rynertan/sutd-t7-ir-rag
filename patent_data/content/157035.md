## Description
This invention relates to a mechanical key actuated membrane switch assembly for generating binary coded electrical signals, the keyboard having a date input through the agency of mechanically depressible keys and starts from EP A 0 087 389. The conventional electrical keyboard, for an electronic typewriter or for a data entry station, comprises a set of discrete key modules arranged in a suitable matrix very often chosen to satisfy the requirements of the application. Each key module comprises at least one electrical part of a switch and supports an interchangeable cap which bears the required legend for that key. Actuation of a key changes the electrical properties of a respective circuit either directly or indirectly, hence creating a perceptible signal. Such changes may be brought about through opening or closing electrical contacts, capacitative effects, magnetic effects i.e. inductive, Hall effect, etc. or by optical effects. Desired characteristics for such keyboards, arising from the practice of touch typing are key operating pressures of between 50 and 100 gms force, and a full travel of about 4 mm for each key. Some overtravel in the key operation is a requirement in order to ensure positive operation, generally of the order of 1.5 mm, but this effect should not be perceptible to the operator and the aforesaid 4 mm travel includes this overtravel. By way of example, key modules of the above type, based on the electrical making and breaking of a conductive path, are described in US A 4,316,066. Such key modules are usually inserted into a supporting apertured plate for positioning above a printed circuit board which carries the electronic components associated with encoding the key signals for onward transmission and the inter module wiring into which the key modules are soldered. Touch or pressure sensitive panels comprising membrane switch arrays are also used to provide data entry stations having a visually similar arrangement to that of conventional keyboards, but these have not been found suitable for high speed typing because the mode of operation, e.g. absence of key travel, etc., eliminates or reduces mechanical feedback of information to the operator during operation. This shortcoming of such panels has been ameliorated to some extent by, for example, interposing a collapsible element between each key and the associated membrane switch contacts so as to provide for a greater travel of the key . By interposing a second compressible element a degree of switch overtravel has been introduced without greatly complicating the structure, but only at the expense of an increase in the operating force when the overtravel operation is brought into effect. Hence the overtravel characteristic is perceptible to the operator. Moreover, difficulty has been found in providing a tactile response with such elements which corresponds with normal, acceptable, key operation, and the actuating force is often very much higher than the optimum force referred to above. One object of the present invention is to provide an actuating mechanism which can be interposed between a conventional key cap of a module of a keyboard switch array and the corresponding switch element in the switch array so as to provide the operating characteristics of a normal full travel key, for example as illustrated in the aforesaid US A 4,316,066. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an electronic keyboard with discrete mechanically depressible keys, at relatively low cost, and having a sealed membrane switch array panel to prevent ingress of contaminants. A prior keyboard which approaches this objective is described in EP A 0087369. Each key module has, as its switch actuating member, a Y shaped spring, the vertical leg of which constitutes a free end whilst the bifurcated arms are attached to and are integral with a base member from which the spring has been struck. An integral downward facing portion is formed at the junction of the arms of the spring member to abut the upper membrane of the membrane panel. When the free end of the spring is pushed downwards by the corresponding key plunger, the downward facing member pushes on the membrane underneath and closes the corresponding contacts. Overtravel of the key causes the spring to bow about a node formed along the spring at the downward facing member. This spring arrangement is relatively complicated and the diverging slots which must be provided to define the bifurcated arms weaken the base member to the extent that the latter has to be secured to a rigid floor member at the junctions of each of the arms with the base member. This involves penetrating the membrane package at each fixing point and hence any hermetic sealing is compromised. The present invention provides a key actuated membrane switch assembly, having at least one switch, comprising a key operated switch actuating member mounted on a displacement sensor consisting of first insulative membrane adjacent the switch actuating member and a second insulative membrane, each membrane being respectively positioned on either side of a third membrane comprising an apertured spacing means, said first and second membranes each bearing on their internally facing surfaces in respect of each switch a respective one of an opposed pair of contacts on a common axis, each contact consisting of a conductive layer deposited on the respective membrane, said pair of contacts being disposed in an aperture in the third membrane and comprising part of a normally open circuit which is closed when the said first membrane is flexed into the space provided by the said aperture so as to abut the said second membrane, the said conductive layers thereby touching, and in which said switch actuating member is arranged such that when actuated it applies pressure on said first membrane along the common axis of said contacts through the intermedium of a spring, electrially insulated from the contacts, formed as a flat strip supported at one end and having a bend along its length so as to define a lever having one end at the bend about which it flexes and another, free end which is displaceable by the switch actuating member, said lever providing an abutment surface which bears on the first membrane along the common axis of the contacts when the spring is flexed, characterised in that the bend of the spring is spaced away from the spring support so as to define an elongate lever having first and second elongate portions on either side of the bend and the latter defines a discontinuity in direction of the said portions, said bend being aligned with the common axis of the contacts, said first elongate portion of the lever extending from said supported end of the spring to the bend along a plane which is substantially parallel to the plane of the said first membrane, and the second elongate portion of the lever extending from the bend to the free end of the lever generally in the same direction as the first portion and in a plane disposed at an angle intermediate the plane of the first membrane of the displacement sensor and the plane perpendicular to the said first membrane, the bend in the lever forming a knee is flexed towards the first membrane, which when depressed by actuation of the switch actuating member against the adjacent said first membrane, displaces the latter into contact with the said second membrane. The invention is also characterised in that the displacement sensor, comprising said first, second and third membranes, forms a sealed package. The free end of the lever is arranged directly beneath the respective key. When the key is depressed the spring is hinged substantially bodily about its supported end until the said knee by contacting the membrane surface, causes actuation of the respective switch. Further travel, i.e. overtravel, of the key arises as a result of a flexing of the second portion of the spring relative to the first said portion. Such an assembly may be readily adapted to form various keyboards. In one embodiment of the invention a series of parallel sided tongues are arranged along a common axis and each comprising one such cantilevered spring are formed in, or are struck out of, the web of a channel sectioned strip formed from a resilient material, said strip providing the support for the springs and being mounted, preferably by means of an adhesive, on the membrane surface of a member switch panel. In another embodiment each spring is a separate member and each is supported by the body housing of the switch actuating member. In the preferred arrangement of this embodiment the said body is permanently affixed to the said membrane surface by an adhesive. Moreover the membrane panel itself is similarly affixed to a rigid panel which forms its only support. The panel can therefore be a sealed package with the option that external fluid connections can be provided to internally provided channels. Hereinafter the invention is further described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Referring to the drawings, membrane switch panels for the keyboard as shown in Figure 1 are known to comprise first and second sheets of which at least the upper one is flexible, which are positioned on either side of a third sheet. The mutually facing surfaces of the first and second sheets carry positionally corresponding arrays of contacts and the third sheet which acts as a spacing member has an array of apertures which positionally correspond with the arrays of contacts on the said first and second sheets. Each said aperture defines a switch cell containing a pair of opposed contacts. Pressure on the upper one of said first and second sheets brings the two contacts of the switch cell together within the space defined by the respective aperture in the third sheet so as to make an electrical circuit. The upper sheet normally is resilient so as to obviate any necessity for additional biasing means to restore the upper sheet to its normal planar condition after each actuation. The bottom sheet may be rigid, in which case the switch panel consisting of the three sheets may be mounted directly into a console, the bottom sheet providing all the necessary support. In the present arrangement, all said sheets are flexible and are adhesively held together. The bottom sheet is adhesively mounted on a rigid backing plate. In the first embodiment of the invention described hereinafter the switch actuating members, forming the actuating part of the key modules, are mounted by being clipped into C channel strips in which actuating levers, called herein springs, are integrally formed. In a second embodiment, also described hereinafter, there is a separate spring for each key module, mounted on the switch actuator member body, and the latter is secured directly on the upper surface of the membrane switch panel by means of adhesives. In respect of the aforesaid first embodiment, a blank 2 as shown in Figure 2 is prepared from a suitable material, e.g. plastics, sheet spring steel, sheet beryllium copper, etc. The blank is in the form of an elongate strip and may be of any convenient length depending on the number of key modules to be mounted on the strip. Along one side there are a series of regularly spaced notches 3 and along each side there is a row rectangularly shaped apertures 4, the apertures on one side being in registration with the apertures on the other so as to form a longitudinal sequence of equally spaced pairs of apertures alternating with the notches 3. Along the central axis 12 there is provided a row of U shaped slots 6 which terminate at each end in larger diameter apertures 7, thus defining a weakened zone 8 at the neck of each U shaped slot. The slots correspond in number with the pairs of rectangular apertures. Two rows of holes 9, spaced on each side of the U shaped slots, enable the strip to be riveted to a base. A key module mounting strip is formed by bending up the sides of the strip along fold lines indicated by the dash lines 10 so as to provide a channel of the shape indicated in Figures 3 and 4. The tongues defined by the U shaped slots are deformed about fold lines 11 normal to the axis 12 out of the plane of the floor of the strip and into the channel interior as shown in Figures 3 and 4, so as to provide a row of springs 13. Each spring is cantilevered to the floor of the channel and is precisely bent so that its free end is a precise prescribed distance above the floor. The notches 3 define a series of coplanar flanges 14 on one side of the channel which may be individually sprung aside to enable a respective key module 15 to be inserted into the channel as shown in Figure 5, or easily removed, the apertures 4 receiving locating lugs or bosses 16 provided on the lateral sides of the key modules 15. In the keyboard the channel is mounted, in a parallel array with others to give a keyboard layout required by the particular application, for example as shown in Figure 1, one switch element of which is shown in the enlarged sectional view in Figure 6. As shown in Figure 6, the membrane switch panel comprises a pair of flexible sheets 18, formed of plastics material, separated by the spacer 19 of plastics material. An array of apertures 20 only one of which is shown registers with metallic, opposed, contacts 21 deposited with associated inter element printed circuitry not shown , on the internal facing surfaces of the pair of sheets 18. The upper and lower surfaces of the spacer 19 are uniformly covered with an adhesive layer of acrylic material, thus bonding the two sheets 18 and the spacer 19 together. The arrangement forms a sealed assembly, imperviously to moisture from, say, accidental spillage of liquids. A further layer of adhesive 22 secures the switch membrane assembly to a substructure 26, e.g. a rigid aluminium plate. The channel strips are mounted directly onto the switch membrane so that the fold line 11 of each spring 13 coincides with the central axis of the pair of opposed contacts 21 in a respective one of a row of switch elements and so that the pair of holes 7, defining the aforesaid weakened zones 8, correspond with respective internal walls 23 of the spacer. The respective key module not shown in Figure 6 is mounted to the appropriate apertures 4 in the flanges of the channel on the left, as shown in Figure 6 so that its actuating axis is in line generally with the free end of the spring 13. The actuating axis of the key module is therefore displaced from the corresponding switch axis by a distance equal to the length from the bend to the free end of the spring. Rivets 24 only one shown are used at appropriate intervals to secure the channel strips to the assembly however, other forms of attachment of the strip may be used, including suitable adhesives. The function of the weakened zones 8 of the springs 13 defined by the pairs of holes 7, is to create a line of easy flexure, that is a form of hinge. When the associated key is depressed the relevant spring 13 hinges about the weakened zone hence the knee 25 of the spring, formed at the fold line 11, forces together the respective pair of contacts 21 disposed underneath the knee so as to make a circuit. The spring 13 is therefore acting initially as a lever providing a mechanical advantage to actuate the switch of about 4 1. When the contacts 21 are abutting further displacement of the knee is prevented. Additional pressure on the spring causes overtravel, i.e. flexure of the spring about the fold line 11 so that, in its ultimately depressed condition, the spring takes up the disposition shown in dashed outline in Figure 6. The upper sheet and the contact 21 thereon will naturally be displaced downwardly in this condition, but as an aid to clarity, this detail is not shown in Figure 6. When the key is released the spring and the related part of the membrane switch return to their pre actuated condition. The increase of pressure, necessary to cause the overtravel of the spring and key, is slight and not objectionable to the operator. With reference to Figures 7 The membrane switch shown in Figs. 7 Prior to assembly both surfaces of the spacing sheet 114 are coated with an acrylic adhesive material. The three flexible sheets are then pressed together to form a sealed package which is impervious to moisture. So as to avoid problems caused by a compression of the air trapped in the cells during operation, or as a consequence of changes in atmospheric pressure, the rows of apertures in sheet 114 are linked by slots. These slots may extend to pneumatic terminals not shown and be coupled thereby to air inlet filters, etc., or one or more, pneumatic pressure compensators not shown by means of which large changes in ambient pressure may be compensated, such as may be experienced, for example, in aviation use. Between the upper membrane 112 and the assembly of key modules 100 there is provided a further apertured spacing sheet 118 having an array of apertures 119 in mutual correspondence with the switch cells and the respective key modules. Sheet 118 is also coated on both sides with an adhesive material before assembly so that it forms an adherent member for adhesively mounting the key modules on the membrane switch panel 111. The apertures 119 are made large enough to accommodate the entire operative length of the spring and the sheet thickness is chosen to provide the specified pre contact free travel of the spring upon actuation. For the example quoted hereinafter the thickness of the sheet was 5 thousandths of an inch .125 mm . The apertures 119 may be of any convenient shape, e.g. circular, elliptical, oblong, etc., and need not be linked by slots as they are open to the atmosphere via the interior of the switch actuating member bodies. A further, usually non apertured membrane not shown coated on both sides with adhesive material may be used to adhesively mount the assembled membrane switch panel 111 on a rigid base plate 120. The precise arrangement of the switch actuating members 101 on the membrane switch panel 111 is shown in the enlarged section detail of Figure 8 On actuation of the respective key module the free end of the arm of the spring is engaged and depressed by the plunger 108, the spring flexing bodily substantially about the right angle bend at the base of the dog leg portion until the knee 107, by engaging the upper membrane 112 through the aperture 119 and displacing it into the aperture 117, is arrested by the coming together of the contacts 115. Overtravel of the spring occurs thereafter, but the flexing now takes place at the knee 107 and in the said second portion of the spring. In the fully depressed condition of the spring its free end will be lodged within the aperture 119. One of the features of the form of mounting used for the spring in the second embodiment is that any tendency for the spring to come out of the slot in the foot which is unlikely because of the bowing of the dog leg portion is overcome when the key is fully actuated because the spring tries to pivot about its knee 107 during the overtravel portion of movement and thereby force the dog leg portion fully into the slot if it is not so disposed already. By this means permanent fixing of the spring onto or in the body of the switch actuating member becomes totally unnecessary, thereby greatly simplifying manufacture and reducing the parts required in this form of the switch actuating member to four, namely the body 101, the spring 104, the plunger 108 and the key cap 110. Figures 9 The key module of Figure 9 is provided with two horizontal elongate recesses 121 , 122 , and two vertical elongate recesses 123, 124 in the external upper surfaces of the body 101. These recesses are intended to house a light emitting diode 125 and allow a choice of locations, the location being dependent upon the type of key cap which is fitted to the module. In use, the diode is, of course, energised, so as to provide under illumination of the key cap, whenever the respective key is operated. A plurality of slots and passages through the foot of the body which communicate with the aforesaid recesses are provided to enable the terminal wires 126 of the diode to be taken through the foot of the module and through the membrane switch panel and be wired up to switches on the electronic encoding circuit board. The said body 101 also has a passage 127 on its upper part through the respective side wall which exposes the lower part not seen in the drawing of the plunger 108. The latter has a recess in its side, which is aligned with the said aperture 127, which is adapted to receive the cranked end of an optionally fitted double cranked bar 128, the latter when fitted being pivotally supported and retained within a threequarter circular shaped recess 129 provided in a web 130 formed on the side of the body and being similarly supported by identical arrangements on adjacent key modules. A similarly recessed web 131 is provided on the same body alongside the first said web on the near side of the aperture 127, as shown, for the purpose of supporting the double cranked bar from that side. The function of the bar is to provide a mechanical linkage which transmits a key displacement from one key module to another key module situated in the same row. Such provision is required, for example, when two spaced apart switch actuating members are employed to support a space bar, or when one lengthened key cap is fitted to two adjacent key modules. In pre production models of the second embodiment of the key actuated membrane switches described herein which have successfully completed more than 5000,000 key depressions, the salient dimensions were
