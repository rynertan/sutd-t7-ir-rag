## Description
This invention relates to a cartridge handling device and method, and, more particularly, relates to loading and unloading of a rigid, diskette containing cartridge into and from a diskette drive mechanism of a recording reproducing apparatus. Recording and or reproducing apparatus are well known, and such apparatus has heretofore been known which has the capability of reading and or writing magnetic signals on interchangeable flexible disks. While such flexible disks have been known which are loosely contained in a flexible cartridge or envelope as shown and described, for example, in U.S A 4,193,102 , it is also known that such disks may be contained in a rigid cartridge such as shown and described, for example in U.S. A 4,445,157 . The use of a rigid cartridge has now become commonly utilized with 3 1 2 inch 8,9 cm diameter diskettes, and the handling device and method of this invention is designed for use with rigid cartridges. The rigid envelope, or casing, of such a cartridge normally has a central aperture through which the central core disk at the central aperture of the diskette is engageable for rotational drive of the diskette, and there is also a head access slot through the cartridge near one end portion so that a recording head or heads can interact with the surface of the diskette. The head access slot is normally closed by a slidable cover which must be moved in a direction normal to direction of inserting movement of the cartridge, before or during loading of the cartridge, to provide head access to the diskette within the cartridge through the head access slot. In addition, a notch is also normally provided at the edge of the cartridge casing having the shutter mounted thereat, and full cartridge insertion is precluded unless the notch is exposed by moving the shutter to the open position to allow a portion of the device to be received in the de pression at full insertion of the cartridge. When a diskette is loaded into the diskette drive mecha nism, the slidable cover must therefore be moved to the open position for accessing the diskette, and the car tridge must be precisely positioned to allow the record ing reproducing head or heads to contact the diskette at the proper predetermined position through the access slot in the cartridge. Actuators for lifting and then lowering a recording head for use with floppy disks are well known, and examples of such actuators may be found, for example, in US A 4,040,106 and 4,193,102. In addition, devices are known for handling loading and unloading of rigid cartridges, and examples of such devic es are shown, for example, in US A 4,445,157. In the device shown in U.S. A 4, 445, 157, a pressure member, with compression springs depending thereof, is utilized above the cartridge to force the cartridge downwardly againt positioning pins for positioning the cartridge, and pro jections are utilized at the rear of the cartridge space to prevent erroneous cartridge positioning. While not shown in U. S A 4, 445, 157, such devices have heretefore normally included side panels, roller elements, and or carrier pivot means for effecting positioning of the cartridge in loaded and unloaded positions. An another example of such device is disclossed in GB A 2, 142, 464 which describes a recording and reproducing apparatus for a disk cartridge, comprising a cartridge holder for hold ing the disk cartridge and movable between an eject posi tion and a loading position. A load lever is provided for resiliently urging the cartridge holder toward the loading position, and a movable lock member is engageable with the load lever for keeping the cartridge holder in the eject position. An eject lever also serves to open the shutter of the cartridge on insertion. Thus, while diskette handling devices and methods are now known and or utilized, further improvements thereto are still felt warranted, including reducing manufacturing expense and or improving the loading unloading arrange ment. This invention as defined in the independent claims provides an improved cartridge handling device and method for loading and unloading of a rigid cartridge into and out of a diskette drive mechanism. To accomplish the desired end, sliding movement is utilized, without requiring roller elements, side panels or carrier unit pivoting, and smooth and dependable loading and unloading is realized with unloading requiring only a minimum of force and relatively short stroke of an eject button. The resulting device has a minimum of parts, high reliability, and can be assembled by automation. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide an improved cartridge handling system and method for loading and unloading a cartridge into and out of a drive mechanism. With these and other objects in view, which will become apparent to one skilled in the art as the description proceeds, this invention resides in the novel construction, combination, arrangement of parts and method substantially as hereinafter described and more particularly defined by the appended claims, it being understood that changes are meant to be included as come within the scope of the claims. The accompanying drawings illustrate a complete embodiment of the invention according to the best mode so far devised for the practical application of the principles thereof, and in which The cartridge handling system, or device, 14 of this invention shown assembled in figure 6 , includes bases, or support, unit 16 and a carrier unit 17. Base unit 16 includes, as best shown in figures 1 and 2, a casting 19, a lifter mechanism 20, and a base plate and spindle mount 21. While cartridge loading device 14, as shown herein, is particularly adapted to use with a three and one half inch 8,9 cm diameter diskette cartridge, as is now typically used in some computer applications, it is to be realized that the invention described herein can be modified, as would be apparent to one skilled in the art, so as to be usable with any diskette cartridge such as shown in figures 7 through 10 of the drawings and as described herein. As best shown in figures 7 through 10, such a diskette cartridge 23 normally includes a centrally apertured flexible magnetic diskette 24 within rigid, or hard, casing 25 which diskette can be seen in figures 8 and 9 through the partially open figure 8 and fully open figure 9 access aperture in the casing . Casing 25 has a central aperture 26 opening from the bottom side, and a slidable protectived cover, or shutter, 27 at the forward portion 28 of the cartridge. Shutter 27 has slots 29 therein, at the top and bottom sides with only the top slot being illustrated in figures 7 through 10 . As shown by figure 7, shutter 27, when in the closed position, covers head access apertures 30 as illustrated in figures 8 and 9 in the top and bottom sides of the cartridge casing, as well as a notch, or depression, 31 in the edge of the cartridge casing as illustrated in figures 7 through 10 . When in the open position, shutter 27 allows head access to diskette 24 within casing 25, as is necessary during use. A diskette cartridge of this type is set forth in greater detail, by way of example, in U.S. A 4,445,157, except that the shutter, as contemplated for use with this invention, is normally maintained in the closed position by means of an internal spring not shown , which automatic shutter actuation to the closed portion is not specifically shown in U.S. A 4,445,157. As best shown in figures 1 and 2, casting 19 of base unit 16 is formed to receive the remainder of the components of the assembly thereon. As shown, stepping motor 32 is mounted on the top side of casting 19 at a rear corner thereof. Stepping motor 32 is connected with head mounting unit 33 having head or heads 34 thereon through motor shaft 36 and head driving mechanism 37. As is conventional, stepping motor 32 causes head unit 33 to step head or heads 34 along a radial line with respect to flexible diskette 24 by causing movement of head mounting unit 33 along guide 39 mounted on casting 19 to maintain the head or heads 34 upper or lower aligned with the desired track on the diskette. Head or heads 34 are maintained contiguous to diskette 24 through the apertures 30 in the cartridge casing when shutter 27 is in the open position as illustrated in figure 9 . As indicated in figures 1 and 2, head unit 33 has an apertured shoulder 41 through which guide rod 39 is received so that head mounting unit 33 can slide with respect to the guide rod. Bias is applied to head mounting unit 33 by means of spring 43. As also shown best in figures 1 and 2, casting 19 also has lipped holders, or retainers, 44 thereon at the upper side of the casting to receive cooperating tabs, or ears, 45 of lifter mechanism 20 to form a sliding relationship therebetween. When assembled, lifter mechanism 20 is limited to motion forwardly and rearwardly along and with respect to casting 19 and is precluded from movement toward and away from the casting. Casting 19 also has an eject button mounting ledge 46 mounted adjacent to front edge 49 of casting 19. As best shown in figures 1 and 2, latch mechanism 51 has an apertured central portion 52 for mounting of the latch mechanism on upstanding post 53 on casting 19 so that latch mechanism 51 can be pivoted along and adjacent to the upper surface of the casting. As shown, latch mechanism 51 has a ledge 54 extending from central portion 52, a cartridge engaging post, or protrusion, 55 extending upwardly from ledge 54, and a latch 56 extending outwardly from one side of ledge 54. A flat spring 57 extends from central portion 52 in a direction generally opposite to that of ledge 54, with the free end of spring 57 being constrained by post 58 as shown in figure 2 so that, when assembled, bias is applied to the latch mechanism to bias post 55 toward the front of the devie. In addition, a return spring 59 is provided on lifter mechanism 20 as shown in figures 1 and 2 . As best shown in figures 1 and 2, lifter mechanism 20 includes a generally U shaped slider portion 60 having ears 45 extending from the inner sides of the slides, which ears are slidably receivable in the holders 44 of casting 19. Carrier engaging members 62 are mounted on the outer sides of the slider with each member 62 having a ramp 63 with surfaces 64 and 65 thereon that are inclined at different angles with respect to one another, and a flat top portion 66 for supporting the carrier when in the up, or unloaded, position as opposed to the down, or loaded, position . While surfaces 64 and 65 are indicated to be planar, these surfaces could be arcuate, if desired. In addition, latch notch 68 is provided in slider portion 60 of lifter mechanism 20 near one foot thereof, and eject button mechanism 69 is mounted on slider portion 60 at the forward end thereof. Ejector button mechanism 69 includes an actuating button 70 and a bridging portion 71 that is mounted forwardly of ledge 46 of casting 19 with ejector button mechanism 69 being positioned on ledge 46 so that travel of slider portion 60 is limited in both the forwardly and rearwardly directions with respect to base unit 16. Base cover and spindle mounting plate 21 is secured at the bottom of casting 19 so that spindle 73 extends upwardly through aperture 74 in casting 19. When assembled, spindle 73 extends upwardly a sufficient distance to engage and rotate diskette 24 within cartridge 23 when the cartridge is inserted into the cartridge receiving area and the carrier unit, with the cartridge therein, is in the loaded position. In the loaded position, cartridge 23 is supported by upstanding locating posts 75 on casting 19. As shown in figures 1, 2, 5 and 6, upstanding ears 76 and 77 are provided at each side of casting 19, which ears receive side blocks, or abutments, 78 which abutments are located on lower carrier 79 of carrier unit 17, as shown best in figure 3 so that, when assembled, the ears and slide blocks cooperate to constrain the movement of carrier unit 17 to vertical movement upwardly and downwardly with respect to base unit 16 with no forward or rearward movement therebetween being permitted as shown best in figures 5 and 6 . While the side blocks are visible only on one side of the lower carrier as shown in figures 3, 5 and 6, it is to be appreciated that identical side blocks are present at both sides of the carrier as indicated in figures 7 through 10 . Bias is applied to carrier unit 17 in the downward direction relative to, and toward, base unit 16 by carrier return flat springs 81 as shown in figures 5 and 6 extending, at each side of the device, between tab 82 on carrier plate 84 of carrier unit 17 to lip 85 and protruding mount 86 on casting 19 of base unit 16. As best shown in figure 3, carrier plate 84 is a part of carrier unit 17, as is lower carrier 79. Hall effect sensors 87 and 87 , are positioned on the upper side of base plate 21. Sensor 87, senses cartridge presence, and sensor 87 senses the position of the write protect flag carried by the cartridge. Mounts 58, 88 and 89 mounts 89 have notches 90 therein extend upwardly from the rear and front portions, respectively, of casting 19 to receive top cover 92 as shown in figure 6 to complete the assembly of the device. As shown in figure 3, lower carrier 79 has various apertures 94 in main wall 96 to allow the necessary movement of the carrier unit with respect to the base unit, a notch 98 at the front edge, upwardly extending side walls 100, and pins 102 extending upwardly from side walls 100 at the top thereof for mounting carrier cover plate 84 thereat. A cartridge receiving area 104 is established between top cover 84, main wall 96 and side walls 100 to receive cartridge 23 therein, which cartridge is inserted from the front of the unit i.e. immediately above notch 98 in lower carrier 79 as shown in figure 3 . Cartridge 23 is then moved rearwardly for loading the cartridge into the device, as brought out more fully hereinafter. As also best shown in figure 3, a biasing arm 106 is provided in carrier cover plate 84. Arm 106 extends downwardly from plate 84 so that the free end 108 of the arm is engageable with a cartridge inserted into cartridge area 104 to provide a cartridge drag spring and to provide downward bias on the cartridge when in the cartridge area . As shown, biasing arm 106 is preferably integrally formed with respect to carrier cover plate 84 at junction 110. In addition, cartridge guides 112 are provided at the front of the cover plate to assist in guiding a cartridge into cartridge area 104. As shown in figure 4, lift profiles 114 are established on the bottom surface of main wall 96 of lower carrier 79. These profiles contact ramps 63 on lifter mechanism 20 for raising, or lifting, the carrier unit as brought out more fully hereinafter. Shutter actuator 117 is mounted for pivotal movement on pin 118 at the lower rear portion of lower carrier 79. Shutter actuator 117 has an actuating leg 120 extending inwardly along the surface of plate 96 of the lower carrier. Leg 120 terminates at a foot 121 having a protruding heel 122. A shutter actuator return spring 124 extends from shutter actuator 117 in a direction substantially normal to that of leg 120. The end of spring 124 is received between L shaped stop 126 and post 127, both of which extend upwardly from the rear edge portion of main plate 96 of the lower carrier. The assembly of the cartridge handling system, or device, of this invention is progressively shown by figures 1 through 6. The various components, as shown in figure 1, are mounted on casting 19, after which latch mechanism 51 is inserted onto post 53, button ejector mechanism 69 is snapped onto lifter mechanism 20, lifter mechanism 20 is snapped into place on casting 19, and bottom cover 21 is secured to the bottom of the casting to provide the completed base unit 16 as shown in figure 2 . Carrier unit 17 is assembled by snapping shutter actuator 117 on plate 96, using post 118, and securing top cover 84 onto the top of pins 102 of the lower carrier, as indicated in figure 3. The assembled carrier unit 17 is then placed onto the top of the assembled base unit 16 with side blocks 78 on the lower carrier received between ears 76 and 77 of casting 19 , and the flat springs 81 are then installed so that each spring has one end in tab 82 and the other end extending under lip 85 and over mount 86, as indicated in figure 5. Top cover 92 an electronic circuit card is then placed at the top of the device with the front end received in notches 90 of mounts 89 on casting 19, and with the rear end retained on the top of mounts 58 and 88 by screws 129 to complete the assembly, as shown in figure 6. As can be appreciated from the foregoing, fasteners required for assembly have been largely eliminated, and the number of parts have been substantially reduced to facilitate automatic assembly of the device. Operation to load and unload a cartridge into and out of the device of this invention is shown in figures 7 through 9, with figure 10 illustrating a condition under which loading of the cartridge is precluded by the device of this invention. All loading and unloading is accomplished using sliding motion, and there are no roller elements. For loading of a cartridge into the device, the cartridge is inserted into the cartridge receiving area, which opens to the front of the device, with the end portion of the cartridge having the shutter thereat being first inserted into the device. The cartridge inserting direction is, therefore, from front to rear and hence the cartridge ejecting direction is from rear to front of the device. As brought out hereinabove, the carrier assembly, or unit, 17 is constrained by ears 76 and 77 and side blocks 78 so that the carrier unit can slide only toward and away from the base unit i.e., only upwardly and downwardly in a vertical direction toward and away from the base unit when the carrier unit is positioned above the base unit . The carrier unit is spring loaded toward the base unit by the carrier return springs 81. The carrier unit is, however, held in the up or unloaded position, against the return springs, by lifter mechanism 20 when the lifter mechanism is in a first or rearmost position so that the carrier unit is supported by flat portions 66 of members 62 of the lifter mechanism. The lifter mechanism is held in this position by latch 56 of latch mechanism 51 against the bias provided by return spring 59. Lifter mechanism 20 is constrained by tabs 45 slidably received in lipped holders 44 so that the lifter mechanism can move only in a horizontal plane from front to rear along and with respect to casting 19 when the casting is upright as shown in figures 1 through 3 . As the cartridge is pushed toward the rear of the cartridge area 104, the casing is brought toward contact with shutter actuator 117, as indicated in figure 7, so that an accessible shoulder and the edge of the shutter at the shuttered end of the cartridge casing are brought into engagement with the shutter actuator. Continued inserting movement of the cartridge causes leg 120 of shutter actuator 117 to pivot and, in so doing, foot 121 pushes, or slides, shutter 27 on the cartridge towards the open position, as indicated in figure 8. This exposes the media diskette 24 within the cartridge to the read write head or heads . This opening movement of shutter 27 also allows the toe of foot 121 of the shutter actuator 117 to fall into depression, or notch, 31 in the cartridge, which is necessary to allow further rearward movement of the cartridge. During the last portion of cartridge travel in the inserting direction, the end portion of the cartridge having the shutter thereat contacts post 55 on latch mechanism 51. Further movement then causes the latch to rotate against return spring 57 thereby releasing the lifter mechanism, as indicated in figure 9, at full insertion of the cartridge. The lifter mechanism return spring 59 then causes the lifter mechanism so slide from the rearmost position toward the front of the drive. This forward movement of the lifter mechanism i.e., from the rearmost toward the front of the device is stopped by eject button mechanism 69 to establish the foremost position of the lifter mechanism. When the lifter mechanism slides forward, the carrier unit is no longer supported on the flat portions 66 of members 62 of the lifter mechanism, and carrier return springs 81 pull the carrier unit downwardly toward the base unit. This downward motion also moves the cartridge downwardly when a cartridge is within the cartridge area of the carrier unit and positions the cartridge on the locating posts 75 extending upwardly on casting 19. The carrier unit and cartridge are now in the cartridge loaded position in which position, reading and writing are enabled . This cartridge loaded position also locates the diskette present magnet within lower carrier 79 in the appropriate relationship to Hall effect sensor 87 to indicate that the cartridge is loaded. If, during the cartridge insertion process, shutter actuator 117 does not slide shutter 27 on the cartridge to the open position, or if the cartridge has been improperly inserted, the toe at foot 121 of the shutter actuator will not fall into the depression, or notch, 31 in the cartridge. When this occurs, the heel 122 of shutter actuator 117 contacts stop surface 126 which is mounted on lower carrier 79 , as indicated in figure 10. This toe and heel arrangement at the end of leg 120 of shutter actuator 117 thereafter prevents the cartridge from being inserted far enough into the device to trip the latch, which prohibits the cartridge from being moved to the cartridge loaded position, and thus prevents possible damage to the heads. To eject a cartridge from the cartridge loaded position, the process is essentially reversed. The eject cycle is initiated by depressing eject button 70 located at the front of the device. As button 70 is depressed, the button eject mechanism 69 is moved rearwardly, which causes lifter mechanism 20 connected therewith to also slide rearwardly from the foremost position toward the rearmost position to the lifter mechanism . As the lifter mechanism slides rearwardly i.e., towards the rear of the device , the ramps 64 and 65 on the lifter mechanism are successively brought into contact with the lift profiles 114 on the bottom surface of lower carrier 79 so that such rearward motion of the lifter mechanism causes profiles 114 on the lower carrier to climb up the lifter ramps. Since the carrier unit is constrained to movement toward and away from the base unit, this rearward motion of the lifter mechanism causes the carrier to be forced upwardly in a vertical direction away from the casting. The eject button must be depressed a sufficient distance so that the carrier unit is secured in the up or unloaded position by lifter mechanism 20. If the button is not sufficiently depressed, the carrier unit will return to the loaded position. When button 70 has been sufficiently depressed, arm 54 of latch mechanism 51 is freed to rotate and, when rotated, falls into latch notch 68 in the lifter mechanism. As the latch mechanism rotates, upwardly projecting post 55 contacts the end portion of the cartridge i.e., the end portion having the shutter thereat . Further latch rotation pushes the cartridge toward the front of the device. After the cartridge has been pushed far enough forward to release end 121 of shutter actuator 117 from depression 31 in the cartridge, this allows the shutter return spring within the cartridge not shown and shutter actuator return spring 124 to eject the cartridge still further so that the end portion of the cartridge opposite to that having the shutter thereon can be easily grasped for manually completing removal of the cartridge from the device. Cartridge drag spring 106, positioned at the upper carrier plate, places a slight drag on the cartridge to control the distance the cartridge is ejected by the springs. During the eject cycle, rotation of the latch mechanism is also restricted by the lifter mechanism. This prevents the cartridge from being prematurely ejected from the device before the latch release position is reached to prevent possible damage to the head or heads . As can be appreciated from the foregoing, the device and method of this invention provides improved cartridge handling utilizing only sliding motion and without requiring roller elements, with initiation of cartridge ejection requiring only a relatively short stroke and low force, and results in a device that has high reliability and can be assembled by automation.
