## Abstract
The burner comprises a body 10 for receiving gas and a plurality of spaced apart burner elements 12 fixed to the body in a substantially gas tight manner. The elements 12 locate in slots 18 in the body with a slotted intermediate member 13 arranged between the body and the element. Each of the elements has marginal portions 27 which project through associated slots in the body and intermediate member. The portions 27 are deformed so as to interconnect the body and the burner.
