# Process for desensitizing 2,4,6 trinitrotoluene, solutions thus obtained and their application for preparing phloroglucinol.

## Abstract
A process for desensitizing the explosive 2,4,6 trinitrotoluene TNT by preparing a solution of TNT in oleum of which the strength may vary from 10 to 40 by weight as well as solutions thus obtained are described. Preferably, at least 400 g and at most 480 g of TNT are dissolved per litre oleum of 20 25 . The solutions of TNT in oleum thus obtained are espe cially useful for the preparation of phloroglucinol.
