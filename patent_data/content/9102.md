# A multipolar resolver.

## Abstract
A multipolar resolver having a substantially cylindrical rotor of magnetic material with A n rotor poles 12, B₁ B₁₀ provided equidistantly on the outer periphery thereof, a stator of magnetic material with B n stator poles P₁ P₈ provided equidistantly along the circumference concentric with the axis of said rotor, and a central coil 15 provided on said stator along substantially the same axis as said rotor axis. A, B and n are positive integers and the value of A dif fers from the value of B by one such that A B 1. In order to provide a multipolar resolver which re quires no coils on the rotor and which permits an increase in the number of poles of the resolver without a correspond ing increase in complexity and manufacturing cost, sine and cosine coils 16, S₁ S₄ 17, C₁ C₄ are wound alter nately on circumferentially successive ones of the stator poles P₂, P₄, P₆, P₈ P₁, P₃, P₅, P₇ . Circumferentially succes sive ones of the sine coils 16, S₁ S₄ are connected in series with each other and are wound in opposite directions of winding alternately and circumferentially successive ones of said cosine coils 17, C₁ C₄ are connected in series with each other and wound in opposite directions of wind ing alternately.
