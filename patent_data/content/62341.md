# Pump assembly with improved seal.

## Abstract
A hand actuatable pump assembly 10 is adapted to be sealingly secured to the mouth of a container 11 for dispensing material in the container. The pump assembly includes a generally tubular adapter 20 that defines a discharge passageway 22 . A spray member is seated on the adapter 22 and defines a discharge opening 19 in communication with the passageway 22 A stem 24 defines a tubular portion 26 that is secured to the adapter 22 . A valve body 30 defines a pressure chamber 34 . A piston 40 sealingly and slidably en gages the wall of the valve body 30 . The piston 40 comprises a first portion that is clamped between the stem 24 and the adapter 20 , and a second deflectable portion in sealing engagement in a position of rest with the stem 24 , and being out of sealing engagement with the stem in a second position of actuation. The deflec table portion of the piston 40 is deflectable in response to hydraulic pressure upon movement of said piston downwardly into the valve body 30 to expose the pas sageway 22 to communication with the pressure cham ber 34 .
