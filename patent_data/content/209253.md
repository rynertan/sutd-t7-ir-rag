# Manufacture of butyl rubber.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a continuous process for the manufacture of butyl rubber in which the monomers are polymerised using a halogenated polymerisation medium in a self cleaning screw extruder at a constant pressure under boil ing plug flow conditions by means of a modified aluminium halide catalyst which operates at high temperature relative to prior art very low temperatures of e.g. 100 C . In contrast to prior art slurry processes, the polymerisation mixture forms a sticky, highly viscous mass which is conveyed by screw ac tion to the extruder outlet as polymerisation proceeds. The butyl rubber product is separated at a high concentration from vapours of unreacted monomers and polymerisation medium which are recycled. Cooling is effected by vapourisation of a portion of the mixture of monomers and polymerisation medium in a flash tank before supply to the extruder and return ing the vapourised fraction and recycle vapours to the flash tank through, in succession, a compressor, heat exchanger and throttle valve. By using the process of the invention, the total energy con sumption in butyl rubber manufacture can be cut to about 20 of that of prior art processes.
