# All dry solid potassium seed regeneration system for magnetohydrodynamic power generation plant.

## Abstract
Process for converting potassium sulfate formed by using potassium carbonate to increase conductivity and scavenge sulfur in a magnetohydrodynamic power plant back into potassium carbonate for reuse in the power plant. The potassium sulfate is first reacted with a reducing agent in the presence of up to about 40 boric oxide at from 800 to 1300 C for at least about one hour to produce potassium sulfide. The potassium sulfide is then reacted with carbon dioxide and steam at from 450 to 750 C for at least about an hour to produce hydrogen sulfide and potassium carbonate. Finally, the potassium carbonate and the hydrogen sulfide are separated and the potassium carbonate is recycled.
