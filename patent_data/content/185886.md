# A method and device for detecting an internal ground fault on the coil of an induction furnace.

## Abstract
A method and device for detecting an internal ground fault in the coil of an induction furnace is described. The voltage or current across the coil is monitored and this is compared with the current passing through the melt bath. The companion between these preferably by determining the phase difference, indicates whether a ground fault exists. A graphic representation of the furnace is also generated to illustrate the location of the ground fault with respect to the turns and yokes of the coil.
