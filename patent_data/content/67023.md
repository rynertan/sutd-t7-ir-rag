# CASTORS

## Abstract
A castor suitable for supporting a builders staging allows support to be provided by either a wheel or a base plate resting on a ground level. Braking means permit the castor to be locked in either case. The castor incorporates a wheel 10 mounted on an axle 11, which axle is connected to two plates 25, 26 depending on either side of the wheel from a support plate 24 mounted above the wheel. A leg member 35, rotably mounted to the support plate, connects to an upright 36 of a builders staging. A base plate 13 includes upstanding plates 14, 15 which are piv otally mounted to the axle, the base being capable of assuming a lower position whereby the base provides support, or of assuming an upper position whereby the wheel provides sup port. A braking lever 47 includes cam plates 41, 42 having cam slots to locate with the axle. Depression of the lever brings the wheel into firm contact with braking bar 40.
