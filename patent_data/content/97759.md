# Barrier anodizing of aluminium and aluminium alloy substrates.

## Abstract
In a barrier anodizing process for an aluminium or aluminium alloy substrate, the anodizing current density is maintained between 20 and 300 ma cmÂ² and the current is terminated after a period of time not appreciably exceeding the barrier formation time. The voltage is preferably main tained between 150 and 200 volts.
