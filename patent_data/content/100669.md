# Acicular ferromagnetic alloy particles for use in magnetic recording media.

## Abstract
Acicular ferromagnetic alloy particles doped with silicon, chromium, nickel and optionally magnesium for use as the magnetic material for magnetic recording media such as magnetic tapes and discs are prepared by heating at 300 to 500 C under reducing atmosphere acicular particles of α iron III oxide hydroxide doped with silicon, chromium, nickel and optionally magnesium or acicular particles of α ferric oxide doped with silicon, chromium, nickel and optionally magnesium obtained by dehydrating the acicular particles of α iron III oxide hydroxide doped with silicon, chromium, nickel and optionally magnesium.
