# CONNECTOR MEANS FOR TRANSDUCER MONITOR SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A connector 3 for connecting a transducer 1 to a moni tor 2 in a system for monitoring physiological conditions in humans and other animals includes means 4 for transforming the impedance level of signals from the transducer to a level ap propriate for the monitor and for drawing and adapting power from the monitor for effecting this impedance transformation. The connector 1 may also include one or more of the follow ing means 5 a mechanism for adjusting the offset or sensitiv ity of the signal from the transducer a mechanism for detecting the absence of the transducer a mechanism for detecting an open circuit between the monitor and the transducer a device for converting power drawn from the monitor to direct current where the power drawn from the monitor is, before conver sion, either sine wave or pulsed a mechanism for regulating the current from the monitor and a mechanism for eliminating common mode voltage errors from the transducer signal.
