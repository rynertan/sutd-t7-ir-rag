# PACKAGING MACHINE

## Abstract
A packaging machine for articles or products, of the type in which the article, preferably disposed on a tray or container 10 , is wrapped with a film of transparent plastic material.The machine comprises microprocessor control, and incorporates a weighing unit and a labelling unit. The mechanical drive ac tions are distributed selectively by a main shaft 50 which is constantly rotated by worm gearwheel couplings 51 61, 52 62, 53 63, 54 64 controlled by electromagnetic clutches 71, 73, 74 , A peripheral cam contour associated with micro swtiches controls the elementary operations of each individual phase, which requires one complete revolution of the corre sponding gear wheel. The operating stages can be selected so as to enable the weighing unit, the labelling unit etc. to be used alone. A lifting plate 20 is formed from a matrix structure of support members 400 able to pass through the horizontal pro duct conveyor, and the resting surfaces of the support mem bers can be swivelled to facilitate folding the plastics sheet, without compromising the support stability.
