Example of realisation 1. The crank mechanism shown in figs 1, 2, 3 of the drawing comprises a piston 1 connected with the connecting rod 2 by means of a piston pin 9. Bee ides, it comprises an eccentric sleeve 4 being an intermediate element between a connecting rod journel 5 of the crankshaft 6 end the big end of the connecting rod 2. The axis of the internel hole of the sleeve 4 is moved in relation to the exis of the external cylindrical surface of the sleeve 4 by the size of the eccentric e equal to 6 of the crsnkthrowR of the cranksheft 6. The eccentric sleeve 4 is connected with the driving gear ensuring the angular velocity m of the sleeve 4 in relation to the connecting rod journal 5 of the value m 157 s 1, the angular velocity of the crsnksheft b being equal to 314 The driving gear shown in fig.4 and fig,5 of the drawing consists of e pair of external gear wneels 7 and d, tne gear wheel 7 being coupled with the eccentric sleeve 4, and the gear wheel 8 being coupled with the crankshaft 6 through the intermediary of e set of gear wheels 9. The control mechanism 10 of the angular position of the eccentric sleeve 4, as shown in fig.6 of the drawing, causes definite position of the axis 11 of the sleeve 4, expressed by the angle alpha o 0 , in relation to the crankthrow R of the crankshaft 6, determined at such position of the crankthrow R in which the piston 1 is moat distant from the crenkshaft 6. The mechanism operates in the below described way. During rotation of the crankshaft 6 the driving gear of the sleeve 4 makes the sleeve 4 spin around the connecting rod journal 5 with the angular velocity m 157 s 1, thet is, with the angular velocity twice lower from the spinning velocity of the crenksheft 6, the sleeve 4 spinning in the direction compatible with the spinning direction of the crankshaft 6. Subsequent nositions of the crenk mechanism are shown in fig.7 of the drawing. At the angle of rotation of the crankshaft 6 equal to Oo the crank throw R, the eccentric axis e and the connecting rod 2 are set in one line. When the crankshaft 6 turns by the angle of lao0, the crenkthros R is directed downwards, whereas the eccentric axis a is turned in relation to the connecting rod journal 5 by the angle of 900. During that time the piston 1 performed the stroke S1. At the angle of rotation of the crankshaft 6 by 3600, the crankthrowR is directed upwards, whereas the eccentric axis e turned in relation to the connecting rod journal 5 by the angle of 180 .During that time the piston 1 performed the stroke S2, shorter from the stroke S1. On the other hand, at rotation of the crsnksheft 6 by the angle of 5400, the piston 1 performs again the stroke S2. After rotation of the crankshaft 6 by the angle of 7200 the engine working cycle is finished, whereby the elements of the crank mechanism take up such a position PS at the 0 angle of rotation of the crankshaft 6.

During that time the piston 1 has also performed the stroke S.
