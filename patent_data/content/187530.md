# Process for the preparation of alpha L aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester.

## Abstract
Process for preparing alpha L aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester which comprises treating, as a raw material, N formyl alpha L aspartyl L phenylalanine in methanol in the presence of an acid to form alpha L aspartyl L phenylalanine dimethyl ester, hydrolyzing the alpha L aspartyl L phenylalanine dimethyl ester by bringing it into contact with hydrochloric acid in the presence of methanol as desired, separating the thereby precipitated alpha L aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride and neutralizing the hydrochloride. The raw material may contain N formyl beta L aspartyl L phenylalanine in an amount of 30 by weight or less.
