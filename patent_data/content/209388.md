# DRY SPRINKLER SYSTEM

## Abstract
A dry sprinkler system has a compressed gas pipe 27 connected to supply a pilot of a normally open water valve 23 and for charging a main dry sprinkler pipe 3 . The valve 23 is interposed between a water a supply pipe 2 and the sprinkler pipe 3 . The pilot activates the valve 23 in response to gas pressure to a closed position in which water pressure helps to maintain the valve 23 closed. A pressure operated switch means 35 reacts to low pressure in the pipes 3 at a level between the closing pressure and a low pressure at which the pilot allows the valve 23 to open in the event of a fire.

## Description
This invention relates to a dry sprinkler system for use especially but not exclusively for domestic or small commercial applications. Dry sprinkler systems are known utilizing dry piping up to the sprinkler head which is filled with water only when required to douse a fire. This type of dry system is used where the system is exposed to temperatures which are liable to drop below freezing which would normally freeze a wet sprinkler system. The known dry sprinkler systems use clapper valves which are held closed by the pressure of air or gas in the dry sprinkler pipes, the air being on one side of a clapper valve and water under pressure being on the other side of the clapper valve. This type of dry system has been in use for about 100 years. The clapper valve has been made of cast iron and is used in connection with pipe sizes the smallest of which is a 2 ½ inch 63.5 mm supply pipe. The invention provides a dry sprinkler system in which a compressed gas pipe is connected for feeding compressed gas to a pilot of a normally open water valve and for charging a main dry sprinkler pipe, the valve being in interposed between a water supply pipe and the main dry sprinkler pipe and being activated by the pilot, in response to gas pressure, to a closed position maintained by the water pressure in the pipe. The sprinkler system may be pressurized with compressed air. The water valve may be a normally open unit in which the main water flow orifice is sealed by a disc, the disc being held in closed position by water pressure. The gas operated pilot valve may maintain or release the water pressure so causing the disc to open or close the water flow orifice. Preferably the compressed gas circuit includes a pressure gauge and a check valve to prevent backflow of water from the sprinkler system back to the pilot valve. Preferably a pressure switch means is also provided which senses reduction in pressure of the compressed gas and which may sound an alarm to indicate low air pressure either through malfunction or through a sprinkler head having opened during a fire. Preferably a visual and or audible low pressure alarm is arranged to be activated by the pressure switch means at a lower pressure condition at a first pressure level, preferably at from 18.5 and 30 p.s.i.g 12.95 to 21 per sq mm gauge , and a visual and or audible alarm is arranged to be activated by the pressure switch means at a second pressure level below the first to provide a fire alarm, preferably at from 10.5 to 18.5 p.s.i.g 7.35 to 12.95 g per sq mm gauge . Referring to Figure 1, the sprinkler system consists of a valve and control system box 1 for accepting a pressurized water supply 2 and for connecting such supply to a sprinkler system 3 having sprinkler mounts 5 to which are secured standard heat operated sprinkler heads 7. The front of box 1 has an aperture 9 through which can be observed a pressure gauge 11 which shows the pressure of the compressed air in the pipe 3. The visual and audible alarm 13 is also secured to box 1 by a wiring conduit 15. The alarm 13 has a low pressure light 17, a fire alarm indicator light 19 and an audible alarm 21. Referring to Figure 2 the water supply main 2 is coupled to an air operated normally opened water valve 23 which is one of a standard line of valves manufactured by Ascoletric Limited of Brantford, Ontario, Canada. The model numbers of suitable valves are The compressed air part of the system has a quick disconnect 25 which feeds pipe 27, the pressure in the system being indicated by a pressure gauge 29. A pipe 31 feeds compressed air directly to valve 23. A check valve 33 is positioned between pipe 27 and a pipe 3 to prevent backflow of water into the valve from the sprinkler system after activation. A double acting pressure switch 35 is coupled to the pipe 27 and is electrically connected to the visual and audible alarms 17, 19 and 21. Standard electrical circuitry can be used for the alarm circuits. The system operates as follows To charge the system, a supply of compressed air is fed to quick disconnected 25 through pipe 27 to raise the entire pressure up to approximately 40 pounds per square inch 28 g per sq mm and close the valve 23. The main water supply can then be opened to the valve 23 which will be held closed. In the event of a gradual loss of system pressure through leakage, the pressure gauge will show the reduction in pressure and when it reaches 30 pounds per square inch 21 g per sq. mm as indicated in Figure 3, the low pressure visual indicator will light and the audible alarm 21 will produce an intermittent alarm signal Figure 3 . The source of leakage should then be located and the compressed air be brought up again to 40 pounds per square inch. In the event of a fire Figure 4 , at least one of the standard sprinkler heads 7 will open, the air pressure in the sytem will drop as air leaves the sprinkler head, and the low pressure indicator and alarm will be activated, followed shortly by the fire alarm indicator and a continuous audible firm alarm signal. At the time the fire alarm visual and audible signals are produced, the valve 23 will operate through a reduction of air pressure in the air pilot valve and the water supply main will be connected directly to the sprinkler pipe system so flushing or purging the sprinkler pipe system of air and providing water at the open sprinkler head or heads. The sprinkler system is now fully functional to slow the spread of fire and will continue to supply water through the sprinkler head until the water supply is terminated. This is the condition of the system as shown in Figure 5. In the event of a loss of system pressure due to a compressed air leak, the valve 23 would open under the influence of the pilot valve, the sprinkler pipe system would then be charged with water so that the system would function as a wet pipe system. The loss of air pressure would also activate the low pressure visual and audible alarms and possibly the fire visual and audible alarms, depending upon how low the sytem presure reaches, however no water would be ejected from the system as the sprinkler heads 7 would still be closed. The sprinkler system would however then be prone to freezing, however the alarms should provide sufficient warning to the operator to check the system and put it back into a safe from freezing condition Figure 6 . Referring to the graph as shown in Figure 7, a more detailed analysis of the working of the system is provided as follows It will again be noted that from point 3 in this abnormal sprinkler operation, all visual and audible warnings are ignored and no checks were made. Also, if there had been no fire during this abnormal sprinkler operation, the system would have been full of water and subject to freezing. In this default mode the system of the invention is still operative but exposed to freeze damage. In another embodiment of the invention a micro compressor is used in the system to automatically replenish loss of compressed air due to leakage, and Figure 8 shows a graph in which a micro compressor is utilized in the air system. It will be noted that when the micro compressor is operated, the low pressure visual and audible warnings are also operated to alert that there is leakage which should be attended to. The use of a micro compressor, however, does prevent the system from reverting from a wet system which could happen when the system is left unattended. The danger of freezing therefore can be avoided and system maintenance minimized. The operation of the systems has been discussed with reference to Figures 7 and 8 utilizing various parameters, however these can obviously be altered to suit the conditions. In this regard, it has also been found that the use of a lower charging pressure than 40 pounds per square inch has been found to provide satisfactory and in fact superior operation. Referring specifically to Figure 10 which shows the operation of the dry sprinkler system with an on line micro compressor, an analysis of the working of the system is as follows. The air pressure can also be obtained from a pressure regulated reservoir which could already be used for other purposes in a commercial establishment such as, for instance, a service station. The operation of such a system is shown in Figure 11 and can be analysed as follows In Figure 9 there is shown another embodiment of the system which, as well as having the common features as shown in the embodiment of Figure 2 also include features which make the system react more quickly after a sprinkler head is opened under the influence of heat. The sprinkler pipe system has been modified in this embodiment so that there are separate sprinkler branches from the sprinkler main pipe 3, these pipes feeding individual zones and each being controlled by its own valve. Two separate zone pipes 37 and 39 are shown, these being controlled by air operated water valves 41 and 42 respectively, these valves being each identical to valve 23. Both of these valves 41 and 42 are operated through an extension 43 of the compressed air pipe 27. Pipes 44 and 46 feed compressed air respectively to valves 41 and 42 through respective check valves 45 and 47. Check valves 49 and 51 are positioned to quickly bleed air from the valve when the air pressure in one of the sprinkler zones drops due to a sprinkler head opening. In order to replenish the air in the system, as well as the quick disconnect 25, a micro compressor 53 is used, this compressor feeding air through a check valve 55 into the compressed air pipe 27, upon activation of the circuit which controls the low pressure alarm. In the event that sprinkler head 7 is identified in Figure 9 opens due to a fire in that zone, pilot air pressure to valve 41 will be lost in pipe 37 through the check valve 49 such that the zone valve 412 will quickly open. The compressed air from pipe 27 will also quickly vent through pipe 44 and branch 37 thus venting the pilot pressure through pipe 31 from the main valve 23. Thus the main valve 23 will open even before air pressure in the sprinkler main pipe 3 has fallen significantly. Water will thus flow much earlier from water supply main 2 into sprinkler pipe system 3 than in the previous embodiment and will then immediately flow through the open valve 41 into the sprinkler zone pipe 37 and out of sprinkler 7. Unless the fire spreads to further sprinkler arms, the other sprinkler heads will remain sealed and pressurized and water supply will only have to flood the main and triggered zone. Thus the water will achieve full discharge pressure much quicker than in a non zoned system. It becomes unnecessary to purge water from the pipes in the other zones if these are not affected by fire. Referring now specifically to Figures 12 and 13 there is shown a parallel local zone valve system which has a control box 57 into which enters a main water pipe 59 which branches to pilot operated zone valves 61 and 63. Each zone valve is coupled to a separate sprinkler system 65, two being shown in Figure 12 and three being shown in Figure 13. Of course, in Figure 13, three zone valves would be required in the control box 57. Each zone valve operates in the same manner as does the valve 23 as shown in Figure 2. The air pressure to operate the zone valves 61 and 63 is supplied from an air pressure manifold 67 which can be either supplied by a central compressor and reservoir or as shown in Figure 12 can be supplied by a micro compressor 69. Alarms 71 and 73 are provided similarly to those shown in Figure 2. The control box which includes the zone valves can be located inside or outside of the protected area. However if located in an area in which it would be exposed to freezing conditions, then the control box and its main water supply pipe should be insulated and heat traced. The sprinkler distribution pipes can be totally external as they are normally dry. The system will operate as follows Figures 14 and 15 show a series remote zone valve system which will primarily be used for industrial applications such as large unheated outdoor storage or unheated indoor storage. A master control box 75 is used, this including a pilot valve 77 operated from an air pressure manifold 77 which has a normal compressed air supply 79, a pressure gauge 81 and an alarm unit 83. Water enters the control unit by way of a main water pipe 85. The outlet from pilot valve 77 is a dry distribution pipe 87 which is then coupled through one way valve 79 to zone pilot valves 91. The zone pilot valves are operated from the compressed air manifold 77 through a pipe system 93. An outlet 95 is coupled through a valve 97 to pipe 87. The sprinkler heads are fed from pipes 99 from the zone valves. When originally charging the system, after the zone valves 91 are set, the pipe 87 can be discharged of compressed air through valve 97 and pipe 95 and the system will then be set. The operation of the system is as follows Figures 16 and 17 show a parallel system having remote zone valve control having a control box 54 with a pilot controlled main valve 56 and the normal type of control system as shown in Figure 14 as being included in the main control 75. A branch pipe 58 feeds to zone pilot valves 60 directly, these being operated by a pipe 62 from the main compressed air manifold 64. The operation of the system is as follows The dual system shown in Figures 18 and 19 is one having wet and dry zones and is meant primarily for one or two family dwellings and other buildings in which there are heated and unheated areas. The control box 64 is the normal self contained unit similar to the one shown in Figure 2 and has a main pipe 66 feeding into it. The water pipe is branched before the pilot valve 68 and has branches 70 which directly feed wet sprinkler systems. A dry pipe system 72 leaves the control box 64 and feeds a dry sprinkler system. The control box 62 will be normally located inside a heated area of a building and can have either a remote or locate audible and visual fire alarm. The system operates as follows It is also possible to easily test the dry systems disclosed without flooding the dry system by inserting extra valves at required places and utilizing an extra pressure gauge to monitor the pressure at the inlet side of the valve. The sprinkler system can then be tested with air pressure above by closing off the water supply and using air pressure on both sides of the valve. The testing procedures will not be described in detail as there are various procedures which can be followed to comply with local firecodes or fire safety regulations these being obvious to a person skilled in this field. The dry sprinkler system is eminently suitable for use in domestic premises, residences, restaurants, service stations and the like which do not require large commercial installations. The system of the invention can be used piping from ¾ of an inch 19.05 mm diameter up to 3 inch 76.2 mm diameter, this larger diameter being the minimum diameter at which known commercial systems operate. The system can operate in conjunction with small diameter pipes at a reasonable cost. Hammer associated with clapper valves can be avoided and the risk of the valves being jolted open with attendant flooding and freeze risks can be avoided. Wet and dry operation can be combined. The system can be operated in untreated areas or in areas outside the wiring area of a house such as attics. The system can be used in bungalow or on the top floor where insulation is laid between and over joists in the standard manner. Various combinations of the above described systems can of course be made within this invention and, although it has been indicated that the main use of this system is for relatively small sprinkler systems, it can of course be used in larger sizes with existing full size systems which utilize 6 inch 152.4 mm diameter or larger pipes. The use of compressed air pilot operated valves in systems of the invention is more reliable than existing clapper valve systems. The use of valves operated by pilot through a supply shared with that for charging the main dry sprinkler pipe provides a system which is reliable in operation and can be combined into a cost effective zoned sprinkler circuit. The system can be provided if necessary with compressed air back up but will continue to function without it although at the risk of freezing problems. The valves so operated provide a large pressure range within which pressure switches and back up systems for compressed air can operate without triggering fire alarms. The valves will remain firmly sealed even in the presence of water supply or gas pressure variations unless triggered by a considerable gas pressure drop. Once the valve has been opened following a drop in gas pressure of sufficient magnitude, the check valve will prevent re closure of the valve as the water pressure rises in the sprinkler pipe. The pressure of water at the outlet side may also assist in preventing re closure of the pilot operated piston 104.
