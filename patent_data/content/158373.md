# Method and apparatus for recording and or reproducing signals on from a record carrier in the form of a tape.

## Abstract
A helical scan recorder for two channel digital video re cording comprises two pairs of write read heads which are situated diametrically opposite each other. To simplify track ing it is proposed to record tracking signals of different fre quencies with one head of each of said pairs of heads and to read said tracking signals during recording via crosstalk, each time using the other head of each of said pairs of heads.
