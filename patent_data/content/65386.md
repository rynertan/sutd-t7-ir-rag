# Surgical drainage apparatus with suction control and indication.

## Abstract
A surgical drainage unit is provided for draining fluids from the body of a patient wherein the suction pressure, applied through a suction inlet of the unit to draw fluids into the unit, is controlled and a direct indication of the applied suction pressure is afforded. A device 50 which contracts responsive to an increase in suction in a collection chamber 16 of the unit is equipped with an indicator vane 58 that cooperates with a fixed scale 60 to indicate the amount of movement of the bellows 50 and hence indicate the suction within the col lection chamber 18 . A manually adjustable control valve 62 controls the amount of air admitted to the suction line 46 within the unit to thereby control the applied suction.
