# Flyer winder for externally slotted dynamoelectric machine core member.

## Abstract
Apparatus for winding coils in the slots of an externally slotted dynamoelectric machine core member 52 comprises a flyer 24 and a support 56 for the core 52 . A shroud member 78 is disposed within the path of rotation of the flyer 24 , the shroud 75 having portions 84, 86 adapted to extend outwardly over each side 62, 64 of the core 52 to overlay a core portion between two slots around which a coil is to be wound. Two rotatable wheel elements 136, 138 are provided on opposite sides 62, 64 of the core 52 and having peripheral surfaces 142, 144 adjacent the shroud portion outwardly facing surfaces 104, 106 . Each of the wheel elements 136, 138 has a cut out portion 154, 156 which communicates with its peripheral sur face 142, 144 and which has a radially extending trailing edge 158, 160 which faces the respective core side 62, 64 as the wheel element 136, 138 is rotated in a direction 162, 164 to move the edge 158, 160 from the inner 96, 98 to the outer 92, 94 end of the respective shroud surface 104, 106 . The wheel elements 136, 138 are rotated in opposite directions 162, 164 an the cut out portions 154, 156 are phase displaced by 180 to permit passage of the flyer 24, 36 as the same rotates about the shroud member 7 8 so that wire is initially wound around the shroud portions 84, 86 and alternately engaged by the leading edge 158, 160 of a wheel element cut out portion 154, 156 and pulled thereby outwardly over the outer end 92, 94 of a shroud portion 84, 86 to guide the wire into and toward the back of the two slots.
