# Asynchronously equilibrated and pre charged static RAM.

## Abstract
In a static RAM fully asynchronous active equilibration and pre charging of the RAM s bit lines 24 provides improved memory access time and lower active power dissipation. Each change in the memory s row 34 address is sensed for developing a clock pulse 50 of a controlled duration. The clock pulse 50 is received by a group of equilibrating transistors 46 and a group of pre charging transistors 46 which are coupled to the memory s bit lines. When the clock pulse 50 occurs, all the above mentioned transistors 46 conduct to effect simultaneous equilibration and pre charging of the bit lines 24 .
