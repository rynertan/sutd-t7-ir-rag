# Method and apparatus of colour signal processing.

## Abstract
This concerns a method and apparatus for generating individual colour signals for each of a number of colour components present in a multi coloured image, given an initial signal in which successive signal elements represent different colour components, for example, a signal derived from a single CCD array masked with an optical filtering element having a repetitive sequence of red, green and blue stripes. In the method and apparatus described, the initial signal is applied to a tapped delay line 36 , the outputs of which represent signal elements of the initial signal for successive time intervals. Assuming that for a given time interval the output of the centre point 40d of the delay line represents red, its value is compared with the values of the preceding and succeeding stages of the delay line 40a and 40g which at that instant have a red representing signal. A comparator 104 supplies a signal which places switches 108, 110 in their upper or lower positions according to whether the comparison indicates that the selected red value is closer to the succeeding or preceding red value. Switches 118, 120, 122 connect respective output lines in successive time intervals directly to the tapped delay line, through a first of the switches 108 to the tapped delay line and through the second of the switches 110 to the tapped delay line. In this way, density transitions in the original multi coloured image occur simultaneously in each of the three colour output signals, thereby improving the apparent resolution.
