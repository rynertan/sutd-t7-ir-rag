## Description
LIMITED POWER FLUORESCENT CEILING LIGHTING SYSTEM SPECIFICATION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to power line operated low voltage limited power fluorescent lighting systems.Description of Prior Art To the best of my knowledge, no power line operated low voltage limited power fluorescent lighting system is available for purchase or has been described in published literature.Rationale Related to the Invention Due to potential shock and fire hazards, presently available power line operated electric lighting fixtures can not conveniently and safely be installed by persons of but ordinary skills. Moreover, the wiring means required for safe installation is costly to acquire and cumbersome to install. On the other hand, if lighting fixtures could be powered by way of so called Class 2 transformers for definition of such transformers, see report entitled UL 506 Specialty Transformers by Underwriters Laboratories Inc., Northbrook, IL 60062 , they could indeed conveniently and safely be installed by persons of but ordinary skills. however, the output of Class 2 transformers is strictly limited in maximum voltage 30 Volt RMS , maximum rated Volt Amperes 100 VA and maximum current 8 Amp RMS and would not appear to yield enough power to provide an amount of illumination that would be considered adequate in a substantial number of ordinary lighting system installations. Yet, within its maximum Volt Amp rating, a Class 2 transformer does have enough power potentially available to provide for an amount of illumination that is nearly equal to that normally obtained from one of the commonly used four lamp fluorescent ceiling fixtures. Hence, if means were provided by which such ceiling fixtures could each be powered by way of a Class 2 power source, a very safe and easy to install and simple to modify ceiling lighting system would probably result. Against this background, it would seem useful to provide for such a Limited Power Fluorescent Ceiling Lighting System which is indeed the overall object of the instant invention. SUMMAHY OF THE INVENTIONObjects of the Invention A first object of the present invention is that of providing a high efficiency easy to install fluorescent lighting system. A second object is that of providing a fluorescent lighting system that is particularly adapted to be used with suspended ceiling systems and that can readily and safely be installed by persons of but ordinary skills. A third object is that of providing means by which fluorescent lighting fixtures can safely and easily be installed and or removed by the do it yourself er without requiring the assistance of an electrician. These as well as other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following deseription and claim. Brief Description Subject invention relates to a high frequency, low voltage, limited power Class 2 fluorescent lighting system and consists of the following principal component parts a a number of power line operated inverter power supplies, each such power supply providing for a plurality of power lineisolated outputs, each such output being of relatively low voltage magnitude 30 Volt RMS and relatively high frequency 30 kHz and having a substantial and predominantly inductive internal impedance, which inductive internal impedance is operative to limit the short circuit output current from each individual output to a maximum not exceeding 8 Amp RMS b a plurality of fluorescent lighting units, each such unit comprising one or more fluorescent lamps and a matching network operative to derive the requisite lamp operating voltages and currents from one of the inductively current limited high frequency low voltage outputs of one of said inverter power supplies and c a plurality of pairs of conductor wires adapted to provide for easy plug in connection between each of the individual outputs of said power supplies and each individual fluorescent lighting unit generally with one such lighting unit being connected with each of said outputs. The power provided to each lighting unit is provided at a high power factor, thereby under the Class 2 provisions of the National Electrical Code permitting a power level of nearly 100 Watt to be provided to each lighting unit which, with the indicated high frequency operation and with presently available high efficacy fluorescent lamps, can provide for a light output of about 10,000 Lumens per lighting unit. Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 schematlcally illustrates, from an overall systems viewpoint, the preferred embodiment of the invention and shows a plurality of power line operated inverter power supplies, each providing power line isolated current limited high frequencyAC voltage for low voltage power limited operation of a number of individual fluorescent lighting units. Fig. 2 schematically illustrates the preferred embodiment of one of said plurality of power line operated power supplies and its multiple current limited outputs and corresponding individual connections with a number of fluorescent lighting units. Fig. 3 schematically illustrates electrical circuit details of an individual fluorescent lighting unit. DESCRIPTIO OK TIIE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTDetails of System and Circuits In Fig. 1, a source S of 120Volt 60Hz voltage is applied to a pair of power line conductors PL1 and PL2. Connected at various points along this pair of power line conductors are a number m of power line operated inverter power supplies PS1, PS2 PSm. To each such power line operated power supply are connected a variable number n of fluorescent lighting units LU1, LU2LUn. The number n may be different for different power supplies and or at different times. Fig. 2 illustrates in further detail one of the power supplies of Fig. 1 and its associated n lighting units. This one power supply is referred to as PSx, and is powered from power line conductors PL1 and PL2. Inside PSx, power line conductors PL1 and PL2 are directly connected with a rectifier filter combination RF, the substantially constant DC output voltage of which is applied to an inverter I. The output from inverter I is a 30 kHz AC voltage, whichAC voltage is applied to the primary winding Tp of an isolation transformer T. The output of transformer T is provided from its secondary winding Ts and is a 30 kHz AC voltage of approximately 30 Volt RMS magnitude. Secondary winding Ts is electrically isolated from primary winding Tp. By way of a number n of inductor means L1, L2 Ln, this transformer output voltage is supplied to a number n of power output receptacles ORI, OR2 ORn, all respectively. By way of male plugs MP1, MP2 MPn, conduction wire pairs CW1, CW2 CWn, and female plugs FP1, FP2 FPn, the output receptacles OR1, OR2 ORn are connected with input receptacles IR1, IR2 IRn on fluorescent lighting units LU1, LU2 LUn, all respectively. The assembly consisting of rectifier and filter means RF, inverter I, transformer T and the n output receptacles OR1, OR2 ORn, is referred to as power supply PSx. Fig. 3 illustrates one of the n lighting units referred to in Fig. 2 as LU1, LU2 LUn. This one lighting unit is referred to as LUx and has a power input receptacle IRx. Inside lightinp, vlnit LUx is a voltage step up auto transformer AT, the input side of which is directly connected with input receptacle IRx and the output side of which is directly connected across a series combination of two fluorescent lamps FL1 and FL2. Fluorescent lamp L1 has two cathodes Cia and Clb and fluorescent lamp FL2 has two cathodes C2a and C2b. Auto transformer AT has three secondary windings ATs1, ATs2 and ATs3, all of which are electrically isolated from one another as well as from the input side of auto transformer AT. Secondary winding ATsl is directly connected with cathode Cla secondary winding ATs2 is directly connected with a parallel connection of cathodes C1b and C2a and secondary winding ATs3 is directly connected with cathode C2b. A capacitor C is connected directly across the output side of auto transformer AT. Description of Operation The operation of the system and circuits illustrated inFigs. 1 to 3 may be explained as follows. In Fig. 1, the pair of power line conductors PL1 and PL2 provides 120Volt 60Hz power to each and every inverter power supply PS1, PS2 PSm. Each and every inverter power supply converts its 120Volt 60Hz input voltage to a plurality of power line isolated power limited high frequency low magnitude AC voltage outputs and each such AC voltage output is directly connected with a fluorescent lighting unit powering this fluorescent lighting unit by way of said power limited high frequency low magnitudeAC voltage. Fig. 2 shows how said power line isolated power limited high frequency low magnitufle AC voltage outputs are obtained. The 120Volt 60Ilz power line voltage is applied to a reetifier filter combination of conventional construction and the output from this rectifier filter combination is a substantially constant DC voltage. This DC voltage is inverted by conventional inverter I to a 30 kHz AC voltage of essentially squarewave shape. This 30 kHz squar ewave inverter output voltage is applied to the primary winding of voltage step down high frequency transformer T which transformer is of conventional construction. This transformer also provides for electrical isolation between its primary and secondary windings, thereby providing for the requisite power line isolation of the AC voltage outputs from power supply PSx. The output of the secondary winding Ts of transformer T is a 30 kHz non power limited essentially squarewave shaped AC voltage with a substantially constant RMS magnitude of about 30 Volt which AC voltage is provided to the n power output receptacles P01, P02 POn of power supply PSx by way of n inductors Lt, L2 Ln. Thus, the magnitude of the current available at any one of these power output receptacles is limited by the reactance of the inductor connected in series circuit with that receptacle. The magnitude of the reactance of this inductor is chosen such that the current resulting when a given output receptacle is short circuited is no higher than 8 Amp RMS. The high frequency AC voltage output from each of the n power output receptacles is applied to a fluorescent lighting unit by way of a conduction wire pair and its associated male female plug means. Fig. 3 shows how the individual lighting units work and more particularly, how the ballasting of the fluorescent lamps is accomplished. The output from one of the output receptacles of power supply PSx is applied by way of a conduction wire pair to power input receptacle IHx of lighting unit LUx, from where it is applied directly to a voltage step up transformer AT, the output of which is applied directly across two series connected fluorescent lamps. The actual ballasting of the two fluorescent lamps is accomplished by way of resonant interaction between the capacitor which is connected in parallel across the two series connected fluorescent lamps and the particular inductor located in the power supply feeding power to the lighting unit tUx. In other words, part of the ballasting function for the two fluorescent lamps of lighting unit LUx is accomplished by way of one of the inductors within the power supply PSx. The rest of the circuit functions within LUx, such as the provision of cathode heating by way of the three secondary windings on AT, is accomplished in manners well understood by those skilled in the art. It should be noted that any one of the lighting units, such as lighting unit LUx, may consist of any number of fluorescent lamp and that these fluorescent lamps might even be mounted in different locations and or located in different lighting structures and or fixtures. However, within the context of the present invention, it is important that all the fluorescent lamps powered from a single output from any of the inverter power supplies, be ballasted as a single entity and that the aggregateVolt Ampere product drawn from this output not exceed 100 VA. It should also be noted that, due to the resonant matching of the fluorescent lamp loads to the source of high frequency power, the current drawn from the inverter power supplies by the different lighting units will be nearly sinusoidal in waveshape and it will be substantially in phase with the fundamental component of the squarewave AC voltage outputs provided by these power supplies. As a result, the power drawn by the lighting units is drawn with a high power factor, which implies a maximization of the power available within a set limit of Volt Amperes. Moreover, resulting electromagnetic interference by radiation from lamps and or conductor wires is minimized. Yet another thing that should be noted is the fact that capacitor C, which is shown in Fig. 3 as being connected across the secondary side of transformer AT, may just as well be connected across the primary side of said transformer. In fact, to provide for the desired power factor correction, the capacitor may even be connected in series with the output or input side of said transformer. It is additionally made note of the fact that the lighting units may comprise incandescent lamps. It is believed that the present invention and its several attendant advantages and features will be understood from the preceeding description.
