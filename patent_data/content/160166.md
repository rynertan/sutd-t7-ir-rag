## Description
DESCRIPTION LOW tAGNETOSTRICTION AMORPHOUS METAL ALLOYS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to amorphous metal alloys and, more particularly, to cobalt rich amorphous metal alloys that include certain transition metal and metalloid elements.2. Description of the Prior Art There are three physical parameters which can inhibit the easy magnetization and demagnetization of magnetic materials strong anisotropy, non zero magnetostriction and, at high frequencies, low resistivity. Metallic classes generally show resistivities greater than 100 micro ohm cm, whereas crystalline and polycrystalline magnetic metals generally show resistivities below 50 micro ohm cm. Also, because of their randomly disordered structures, metallic glasses are typically isotropic in their physical properties, including their magnetization. Because of these two characteristics, metallic glasses have an initial advantage over conventional magnetic metals. However, metallic glasses do not generally show zero magnetostrict ion.When zero magnetostriction glasses can be found they are generally good soft magnetic metals R.C.

The existence of a zero in the magnetostric tion of Co Mn B glasses has been observed by H. Hiltzinger of Vacuumschmeltze A.G., Hanau, Germany. Reference to Co rich glasses containing 6 atom percent of Cr is made by N. Neiman, R.D. Hempstead and N. Kazama in Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 49, p.5663, 1978. Their interest was in improving the corrosion resistance of Co B thin films. No reference to nagnetostriction is made in that article. Saturation moments and Curie temperatures ofCo80 xTxP10B10 glasses T Mn, Cr, or V were recently reported by T. Mizoguchi in the Supplement to the Scientific Reports of RITU Research Institutes of TonokuUniversity , A June 1978, p. 117. No reference to their magnetostrictive properties was reported. In Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 50, p. 7597, 1979, S. Ohnuma and T. Masumoto outline their studies of magnetization and magnetostriction inCo Fe B Si glasses with light transition metal Mn, Cr, V,W, Ta, Mo and Nb substitutions. They show that the coer civity decreases and the effective permeability increases in the composition range near zero magnetostriction.New applications requiring improved soft zeromagnetic materials that are easily fabricated and have excellent stability have necessitated efforts to develop further specific compositions. Summary of the InventionThe present invention provides low magnetostriction and zero magnetostriction glassy alloys that are easy to fabricate and thermally stable. The alloys are at least about 50 percent glassy and consist essentially of compositions defined by the formula Co1 x y zFexNiyTz 100 b B1 wMw b, where T is at least one i x y z x y z 1OOb B1 M , where T is at least one of Mn, Cr, V, Ti, Mo, Nb and W, M is at least one of Si, P, C and Ge, B is boron, x ranges from about 0.05 to 0.25, y ranges from about 0.05 to 0.80, z ranges from about 0 to 0.25, b ranges from about 12 to 30 atom percent , w ranges up to 0.75 when M is Si or Ge and up to 0.5 when M is C orP, said alloy having a value of magnetostriction of about 7 x 10 6 and 5 x 10 6 and a saturation induction of about 0.2 to 1.4T.A preferred magnetic alloy is one, wherein y ranges from about 0.3 to 0.6 or between 0.60 to 0.80 and z is respectively less than 0.2 or less than 0.15 when T is more than 50 percent of at least one of Cr and V, said alloy having a value of magnetostriction of about 6 x 10 6 to 4 x 10 6 and a saturation induction of about 0.1 to 0.9T.Special magnetic alloys according to the invention have a composition selected from the group consisting of Co53.7Ni15.3Fe5.5Mn5.5B20, Co41Ni30Fe5Mn4B20, Co58Ni12Fe6Mn4B20, 58Ni12Fe6Mn4B2o, Co51Ni18Fe8Cr3B20, Co56Ni12Fe6Cr6B20, Co40Ni30Fe5V5B20, Co52Ni18Fe8Mn2B20,Ni45Co26.5Fe7.5Mn1B20, Co39Ni30Cr6Fe5B20, Co51Ni18Fe9Cr2B20 and Co59Ni1 2Fe6V5B20. The purity of the above composition is that found in normal commercial practice. Brief Description of the DrawingsThe invention will be more fully understood and further advantages will become apparent when reference is made to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention and the accompanying drawing, which is a triangular Fe Co Ni diagram showing regions of positive and negative magnetostriction, the dotted line isolating therefrom the region of nickel rich compositions wherein amorphous metals are difficult to form and thermally unstable Description of the Preferred EmbodimentsThe amorphous alloys of the invention can be formed by cooling a melt of the composition at a rate of at least about 105 C sec. A variety of techniques are available, as is now well known in the art, for fabricating splatquenched foils and rapid quenched continuous ribbons, wire, sheet, etc. Typically, a particular composition is selected, powders of the requisite elements or of materials that decompose to form the elements, such as nickel borides, etc. in the desired proportions are melted and homogenized, and the molten alloy is rapidly quenched either on a chill surface, such as a rotating cooled cylinder, or in a suitable fluid medius,.such as a chilled brine solution. The amorphous alloys may be formed in air. However, superior mechanical properties are achieved by forming these amorphous alloys in a partial vacuum with absolute pressure less than about 5.5 cm of Hg, and preferably about 100 am to 1 cm ofHg, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,154,283 to Ray et al.The amorphous metal alloys are at least 50 percent amorphous, and preferably at least 80 per cent amorphous, as measured by X ray diffraction. However, a substantial degree of amorphousness approaching 100 percent amorphous is obtained by forming these amorphous metal alloys in a partial vacuum. Ductility is thereby improved, and such alloys possessing a substantial degree of amorphous,ness are according preferred.Ribbons of these alloys find use in soft magnetic applications and n applications requiring low magnetostriction, high thermal stability e.g., stable up to about 1000C and excellent fabricability.The following example is presented to provide a more complete understanding of the invention. ExampleAn alloy melt of known composition was rapidly quenched to form non crystalline ribbons, presumably of the same composition as the melt. The ribbons, typically 40 micrometers m by 2 mm in cross section, were cut into squares for vibration sample magnetometer measurements of specific magnetization a 4.2K, 9 Koe and a T, 9 KOe with 295 K T Tx, the crystallization temperature. Curie temperatures were obtained from the inflection points in the a T, 9 KOe curves.The magnetostriction measurements were made in fields up to 4 KOe with metal foil strain gauges as reported in more detail by R.C. O Handley in Solid State Communications,Vol. 22, p. 485, 1977 . The accuracy of these measurements is considered to be within 10 per cent of full strain and their strain sensitivity is on the order of Co rich glass compositions with positive and negative magnetostriction can be added linearly to give zero magneto striction. For example, s for Co70Fe10B20 and Co80B20 glasses are 4 and 4 x 10 6 respectively. A 50 50 per cent mixture of these glasses gives Co75Fe5B20 which does in fact show s O O Handley et al., IEEE Trans Mag 12, p. 942, 1976 . Similarly, for Co40Ni40B40 s 7 x10 6 while for Fe80B20 s 32 x 10 6.A linear mixture having 0 would be 0.18 x Fe80B20 0.82 x Co40Ni40B20 Co33Ni33Fe14B20 which is very close to the observed As 0 S composition, Co33.5Ni33.5Fe13B20.The rule of linear combination of opposing magnetostrictions LCOM can be applied across the Co Ni side of theFe Co Ni triangular magnetostrictions diagram shown in the drawing see also U.S. Patent No. 4,150,981 to O Handley .Table I sets forth some typical near zero magnetostriction compositions.

Yet, glassy alloys of zero or low magnetostriction exist there with potential for various applications. Ni rich glasses are more easily made and are more stable if the late transition metal Ni is balanced to a certain extent by an early TM, e.g., Mn, Cr, V. Examples of such glasses include Ni50Mn30B20, Ni60Cr20B20, or Ni70V10B20.Based on the evidence of s 0 alloys set forth above and S the known stabilizing effects of light TM s on Ni rich glasses, new low magnetostriction glasses rich in Ni have been developed in the region below or near the As 0 line in the drawing i.e., glasses initially showings s O by the addition of Mn, Cr, and or V. Thus, for example, Co.25Ni.75 80B20 can be rendered more fabricable and more stable in the glassy state, and its negative magnetostriction can be increased to near zero by substituting Mn, Cr or V for Co Ni.75Co.25 xTx 80B20.
