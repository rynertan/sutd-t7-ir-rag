# Semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A high density of semiconductor device is disclosed, which comprises a semiconductor substrate 102 of a first conductivity type, first and second semiconductor regions 103 104 of a second conductivity provided in the semicon ductor substrate, the first and second semiconductor regions defining a channel region 113 therebetween at the surface of the substrate, an insulator film 106 disposed on the channel region, a conductive layer 110 formed on the insulator film means for producing depletion layers 111 112 from the first and second semiconductor regions in such a manner that the depletion layers contact with each other to isolate the channel region from the substrate, means for selectively feeding majority carriers of the substrate to the channel region at a density higher than that of the substrate, and a means for detecting the existence of the accumulation of the majority carriers in the channel region.
