# Gas discharge display panel, display apparatus comprising the panel and method of operating the display apparatus.

## Abstract
A gas discharge display including a gas discharge display panel comprising a plurality of cells arranged in a column row matrix. Cathodes are connected to the rows and anodes to the columns of the matrix. The cells are arranged in repeating groups each comprising at least two columns. Corresponding cells in each group are primed contamporaneously in a desired sequence whereby the last cell in the sequence to be primed is adjacent the first cell in the sequence to be scanned. In priming the cells each cell is discharged at a low level. Various types of loop sequences are disclosed together with several techniques for isolating priming pulses from display pulses.
