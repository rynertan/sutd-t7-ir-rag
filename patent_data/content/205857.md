TLC silica gel 10 MeOH CH₂Cl₂ R To a slurry of 102 mg of lithium bromide 1.17 mmol, 2.2 equiv. in 3 ml of dry CH₂Cl₂ at 25 C was added a solution of 293 mg of 3,3 dimethyl 2 oxo heptyldimethylphosphonate 1.11 mmole, 2.1 equiv. in 1 ml of CH₂Cl₂ and 148 ml of triethylamine 1.06 mmole, 2.01 equiv. . After stirring at 25 C for 30 minutes, a solution of ca. 0.53 mmole of 1α,2β 5Z ,3β 1E ,4α,5α,6α 7 5,6 epoxy 3 formyl 7 oxabicyclo 2.2.1 hept 2 yl 5 heptenoic acid, methyl ester prepared as described in Example 1 Part M in 1 ml of CH₂Cl₂ was added. The stirring was continued at 25 C for 18 hours. The reaction mixture was then treated with 5 ml of 1 The residue was purified on a silica gel column. Elution with 25 EtOAc hexane gave 130 mg of title enone as a clear oil. To a solution of 130 mg of Part A enone 0.32 mmole in 1 ml of methanol and 1 ml of THF at 25 C was added 78.4 mg of cerium trichloride 0.32 mmole, 1 equiv. . After stirring at 25 C for 15 minutes, the mixture was cooled to 50 C and 12.1 mg of sodium borohydride 0.32 mmole, 4 equiv. was added. The mixture was stirred at 50 C for 3 hours, then poured into 30 ml of a saturated solution of ammonium chloride. The aqueous solution was extracted with three 15 ml portions of ether. The combined extract was washed with 10 ml of H₂O, dried MgSO₄ and concentrated. The residue was purified on a silica gel column. Elution with 25 EtOAc hexane gave 96 mg of title alcohol ester. A mixture of 96 mg of Example 31 alcohol ester 0.23 mmole , 1 ml of 1 This oil was purified on silica gel preparative plates 50 mg batches 0.5 mm plates 10 MeOH CH₂Cl₂ to yield a total of 49.8 mg of clean acid product.
