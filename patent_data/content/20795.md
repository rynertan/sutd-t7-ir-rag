## Description
An infrared tracking systemBackground of the inventionThis invention relates to tracking systems and particularly to novel and improved infrared video tracking systems that provide accurate and stable tracking of high speed targets of varying image sizes.Some prior art infrared tracking systems employed manual target tracking by means of a hand control or a light pencil, while other trackers incorporated automatic target tracking with fixed size tracking gates. The systems utilizing manual tracking are limited by the operator s response and require an uneconomic application of the operator s time. The fixed gate size prior art tracking systems have encountered accuracy and stability problems when tracking targets of varied image size. Summary of the inventionBriefly the infrared tracking system in accordance with the invention comprises an array of detector elements that sense the thermal radiation characteristics of the energy received thereby. The sensor or detector array is scanned mechanically and electronically in interlaced fields and provide video signals representative of the thermal radiation pattern of objects within the field of view of the scanned raster. The video signals are displayed on a screen such as a cathode ray tube in association with signals indicative of the position and size of tracking gates.A video processor discriminates between a designated target signal and background noise signals by sensing the difference in the amplitude level of the target signals within the tracking gates from the average amplitude of signals in background gates.The video processor generates digital signals the time duration of which are indicative of the target image area.The target digital signals are processed in four pairs of tracking integrators to derive position signals representative of the target s position within the sensor s field of view. The digital target signals are also processed by a target size integrator that develops a signal proportional to the selected targets area. The targets area signal is utilized to control the gain of the tracking integrator so as to improve the system s stability for varying size target images. Means are further provided for manually or automatically controlling the size of the tracking gates and in the latter state for automatically expanding the tracking gate size when the target s image is larger than the gate size. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an adaptive gated tracking system with improved accuracy and stability. Another object of this invention is to provide a tracking system with tracking gates that are manually and automatically adaptable to varying image sizes. A further object of this invention is to provide a tracking system which senses when the target image is larger than the tracking gate and which automatically expands the tracking gates to compensate therefore. Another object of this invention is to provide a closed loop infrared tracking system which enables the tracker to maintain tracking anywhere within the field of view, should the target position with respect to the boresight axis of the sensor be changing at such a rate that the gimbals are not able to maintain tie line of sight to the target coincidence with the foresight axis. Still anoèr object of the subject invention is to provide a novel and improved infrared tracking system that incorporates an array of detection elements that may be scanned electronically ancl mechanically in a raster of interlaced fields.

Description of the Preferred EmbodimentReferring first to FIG. 1, an infrared imagingEMI5.2 tb 4 SEP deE ck SEP t4Xç tb SEP sensorA tb 10 consists of an array of elements 12 that sense the thermal radiation characteristics of infrared energy received thereby.The sensor or detector array 10 is mechanically scanned about an azimuth gimbal 14 in the horizontal plane by an azimuth motor 16. As is well known in the art, the azimuth motor 16 may be controlled by an azimuth servo control unit 18EMI5.3 EMI5.4 V7,1iCh generates an analog outputEMI5.5 tb SEP e orR SEP ZE SEP fiC SEP tb signal SEP Hrthat SEP is tb indicative of the instantaneous horizontal position of the sensor.The azimuth servokunit 18 also venerates a sauare wave siqnal Ha, shown by waveformEMI5.6 tb 23 tb FIG. 2, which signal is at a high level voltage state during the time period that the detector array 10 is in the central portion of an azimuth scan sweep.The elements 12 of array 10 may be positioned with n l spaces between the elements to minimize the complexity of the array and the elevation scan of the detector array 10 is interlaced by n to improve resolution. The detector array 10 is driven in an interlaced elevation scan pattern about an elevation gimbal 20 by an elevation motor 22. A conventional elevation servo EMI6.1 unit 24 controls the elevation motor 22 and the elevation servo unit 24 further provides an output signal V. which is an analog representation of the position of the array 12 in the 25 elevation plane wavefori FIG. 2 .For example, if the elementsEMI6.2 SEP h C SEP F cl llQ SEP NK PY.. I tb SEP l axe SEP positioned SEP such SEP that SEP here tb are five empty positions therebetween, the array would sweep a complete elevation dimension of the raster by a six to one interlace of the raster which would comprise six interlace fields.The horizontal array scan could occur at a forty five cycle per second rate for example and the antenna could sweep from lqft to right on three interlace fields and from right to left on the other three fields. The output terminals of each of the detector elementsEMI6.3 tb are tb coupled on a composite lead 26 to an array multiplexer 28.The array multiplexer, as is well known in the art, may be comprised of counters and ring counters which sequentially sample the output of each of the detector elements during a given time period to provide in effect an electronic scan in the vertical dimension. The array multiplexer 28 may be synchronized by clock 30 and the clock signals waveform 31 of FIG. 3 counted down to provide vertical sync signals V5 waveform 33 of FIG. 3 which indicate the start of one readout sequence of the vertical array. For example, the multiplexer rate could be. counted down from an 18.75 megacycles per second clock rate to a 6.25 megacycles per second rate and the vertical synchronization V5 retrace rate would occur at 150 kilocycles per second. It is noted that the timing values selected for this embodiment are only typical values for a given tracker applicaion and that other time bases may be EMI7.1 utilized in accordance with the subject invention. Since the array multiplexer 28 sequentially samples the detector elements 12 at a high rate, as the sensor array is horizontally scanned in tne horizontal dimension and interlaced in the elevation dimension, the video output signal from the array multiplexer 28 is representative of the infrared energy I distribution received during the raster scan period. The received video signals from the output circuit of the array multiplexer 28 are applied to a suinmation circuit 32 and therein sununed with a signal V h and a signal He The, signal Vch is composed of a series of pulses that are indicative of te relative time of occurrence of a pair of vertical crosshairs and the signal Hch is comprised of a series of pulses that are indicative of the time of occurrence of a pair of horizontal crosshairs.The circuits for mechanization of signals HCh andVch will be explained in detail subsequently, but for now it may he assumed that the relative position or timing of these sianals are such as to present intensified lines on a displayEMI7.2 tb SEP seStsL SEP v tb SEP 40 tb of a display monitor 36. The area formed by intersection of the just mentioned crosshairs on theEMI7.3 tb JIJql SEP SCC tb SEP 40 SEP indicates tb the position of the scanned raster in which targets will be tracked by the system of the subject invention. The combined received video signals and crosshair signals are applied from the smmuation circuit 32 to a video inputEMI7.4 SEP L tb iirc fJ138 SEP of tb the display monitor 36. The horizontal deflection circuits of the display monitor 36 are controlled in response to the horizontal position signal, 11r which is applied from the azimuth servo 18 and the vertical deflection circuit response to a vertical position signal Vrl EMI8.1 the mechanization for which will be explained subsequently. The operation of the subject invention will be better understood by referring to the display screen 40 of the display monitor 36. It may be assumed that the position 42 is the center of the raster beina scanned bv the detector arrav 10 and that in response to the video signals applied toEMI8.2 tb thelH tb input terminal 38 of the display monitor 36 the screen 40 pictorially displays the intensity distribution of the infrared energy received by the detectorEMI8.3 tb array tb It may furtherEMI8.4 tb ALe SEP ht SEP SEP gLcRo55 tb be SEP assumed SEP that1 tb signals are displayed as a pair of intensified lines 44 and 46 and that the vertical crosshair signals are displayed as a pair of intensified lines 48 and 5G.The relative position of the area formed by the intersection of the just mentioned pairs of intensified lines is controllable by an operator, during a target designation period, so that the center of the area finned by said intersection may be superimposed upon a desired target image 52. In the interest of clarity, on the display shown inFIG. 1, the target image 52 is presented as a dot, however, it will be understood that in accordance with the principles of the. subject invention the image 52 may be of varying size and that one of the objects of the invention is to provide a tracker that may accommodate targets of greatly varying image size. As will be explained subsequently relative to the tracker portion of the system of the subject invention, the area formed by the intersection of the crosshairs is further divided into four sub areas as indicated on the screen 40 as areas i, j, k and 1.Target signals representative of the target image areas within each of the just mentioned sub areas are compared by the system of the subjcct invention so as to determine the center of the target image area to automatically position the center of tracking gates in coincidence therewith. For example, the target image signals in areas i and j are combined and compared against the target image signals in areas k and 1 and the difference there between accumulated and used to update the position the tracking gates in the vertical dimension.A signal Pvt which is representative of the position of the center of the tracking gate and therefore the center of the target from the vertical center of the raster 42, is also generated by the tracker portion of the subject system. In a similar manner, the target image signals in sub areas i and k are combined and compared against target image signals in sub areas j and k and the difference therel etween is utilized to update the horizontal position of the tracking gates and to develop a signal Ph which is representative of the position of the center of the target 52 relative to the central position of the raster in the horizontal dimension.Also in accordance with the system of the subject invention, target signals are distinguished from background and noise signals by a comparison technique that samples he received video from positions outside of the tracking gates and uses this sampled video value as a reference to sense changes therefrom within the tracking gates which are indicative of the occurrence of the target video. For example, the received video from an area to the left and right of the upper portion of the tracking gate designated area m on screen 40 of FIG. 1 as well as the received video to the left and right lower portion of the tracking gate designated area N could be sampled and used as a reference for target signal discrimination. The received video signals generated in the array multiplexer 28 FIG. 1 are also applied to an input circuit of a video processor 54. The video processor 54 generates digital target output signals, during the timid of occurrence of the received video signals, that are indicative of a selected target as shown by a waveform 56 of FIG. 3. The operation of the video processor 54 will be better understood by.reference to FIG. 4 which shows the processor in greater detail. Referring now principÅally to FIG. 4 the received video after being amplified in a conventional video amplifier 58 is applied to a signal input circuit of a sample and hold circuit 60.Horizontal background gates HUG and vertical background gates VBG are combined in an AND gate 62 and are then applied to a gate input circuit of the sample and hold circuit 60. The just mentioned background gates have a time of occurrence corresponding to areas of the raster designated by the letters m and n on the screen 40 of the display monitor 36. The circuitry for the mechanization of the background gates will be explained in greater detail subsequently. During the time of occurrence of the signal at the output circuit of the AND gate 62, the sample and hold circuit 60 samples and averages the value of the received video that occurs during the background gating period. The value of the sampled video voltage is held by the sample and hold circuit and applied as reference voltages to a pair of comparators 64 and 66. The amplified received video from the video amplifier 58 is applied to signal input terminals of the aforementioned comparator. The outp signal from the comparator 66 is at a high level voltage state, which may be assumed to b a positive voli level1 during the period that EMI11.1 the input received video is greater than the reference value applied from the sample and hold circuit 60.The output signal from the comparator 66 is at a low level voltage state which may be assumed to be zero or ground potential during the time period that the amplified received video is less than the reference potential. The comparator 64 provides an outputEMI11.2 tb SEP I, , SEP cvYp tb signal SEP ai4 SEP terminal tb 68 that is at the high level state during the time period that the amplified received video is less than the reference potential applied thereto and the output signal is at the low level voltage state during the time period that the amplified received video is greater than the reference potential.An output terminal 70, of the comparator 66, is connected to one terminal of a switch 72 EMI11.3 W4 and tb output terminal 68 of the comparator 64 is coupled to a second terminal of the switch 72. A wiper terminal of the switch 72 is coupled to an output terminal 74 of the video processor 54 of FIG. 1. The position selected for switch 72 determines whether the digital signal at the output terminal 74 is indicative of targets that are hotter than or colder than the background signals sampled during the background gate time interval. Referring again to FIG. 1, the output digital signals at the terminal 74 are applied to the gating terminal of conventional electronic gate 76 and a gate area current GAC is applied to the signal input terminal of the gate. The function and mechanization of the circuit that provide the gate area s current will be explained subsequently, but for the present may be assumed that the gate area current is a current signal that decreases inversely proportional to the square root of the area of the tracking gates. The gate area current, atthe output terminat oj the gate 76, its applied in parallel to the signal input circuits or gates 73 through 81 during the time that digital target signals are applied from the terminal 74.The signals at the output terminal of the gate 76 have a time duration that is representative of the portions of target image areas which are encompassed by the tracking gates and have a magnitude that is a function of the square root of the area of the tracking gates. The output current is transmitted from the gate 76 through the gates 78 through 81 in response to tracking gating signals applied thereto. The target signals, corresponding to the area of the raster contained in sub areas k and 1 on the screen 40, of the display monitor 36, are transmitted through the gate 78 in response to a loser tracking gate LTG signal applied thereto. The gated output current from gate 78 is integrated in a lower fast integrator 82 which has an output terminal coupled to a summation circuit 84.In a similar manner, the target signals corresponding to sub areas i and j, on the raster displayed on a screen 40, are transmitted through the gate 79 in response to an upper tracking gate tl TG signal and then applied to an upper fast integrator 86. The output signal from the integrator 86 is inverted in polarity in a conventional amplifier 88, and then applied to the summation circuit 84. Similarly the target signals corresponding to raster sub areas 3 and 1 are gated through the gate 80 in response to a right tracking gate RTG applied thereto.The output signal of the gate 80 is integratedEMI12.1 tb SEP D a, SEP t tb in SEP i SEP fast tb integrator 90 which has an output terminal coupled to a suloala.ion circuit 92.The target signals corresponding to sub areas i and k are trans mitted through the gate 81 in response to a left tracking gate LtTG . The output current from the gate sl. is integrated in a 3erX fast integrator 9d, reverted in polarity in a conventional amplifi X 96 and then applied to a second input terminal of the summation circuit 92.The output signal from the summation circuit 84, which is a function of the difference in target signals processed from the sub areas above and below a reference point indicated by Pv on the screen 40 is applied to a conventional gate 98. The gate 98 is controlled by an update gate signal UDG and in response to this signal the gate 98 discharges the output signal of the summation circuit 84 into Åa vertical output integrator 100.The mechanization of the update gate signal will be explained in detail subsequently, but for the present it may be assumed that this signal occurs ,after sufficient fields have been scanned so that the data signal at the output terminal of the sum nation circuit 84 is a reliable indication of the deviation of the center of the tracking gates from the center of the targets image.In an identical manner, the signal at the output terminal of the sunnuation circuit 92 is gated through a gate 102 in response to the update gate signal and the output signal therefrom is integrated in a horizontal output integrator 104. The signal Pv, which is an analog representation of the vertical position of the center of the target relative to the center of the raster scanned by the sensor 10, is applied to an armament control computer 106. Also, the output signal from the horizontal position of the target relative to the center of the scanned raster, is applied to the armament control computer 106. The armament control computer also receives a signal AZp, from the azimuth gimbal 14, which is an analog representation of the position of the scanned raster in the horizontal dimension relative to an armament reference line of the vehicle upon which the system of the subject invention is mounted. Further, the armament control computer receives a signaL Etp from an output circuit of the elevation giml al 20, vill.ich is an analog representation of the position of the elevation gimbal relative to the armament reference line of the vehicle upon which the system is mounted.The signals AZ and E may be provided by conventional pickoffs mounted on the gimbals, as is well known in the art. For example, they may be furnished by synchro pickoffs or by linear resolvers. In response to the signals Pht Pv, AZp and Eel,, toe armament control computer, as is well known in the art, computes the line of sight position and the line of sight rate of the designated target relative to the armament reference line and provides control signals to a weapon launch system not shown . Referring now principally to FIG. 5, the circuitry for mechanization of the gating signals that control the gates for the fast integrators of FIG. 1 will now be explained. The clock signals, Pc, are applied from the clock 30 of FG. 1 to an input terminal of an integrator 108, FIG. 5.The clock signals develop a staircase type signal in the integrator 108 which is reset to a reference potential level in response to the vertical sync signal Vs applied from the sync output circuit of array multiplexer 28 FIG. 1 . The instantaneous voltage of the staircase signal, at an output terminal of the integrator 108, is representative of the relative position of the array elements sampled by the array multiplexer 28 and thus are a partial representation of the elevation position of the video beam readout by the array multiplexer 28.The interlace signal from the output terminal of the elevation W servo 24 FIG. 1 is summed with the staircase output voltage ofEMI14.1 EMI15.1 integrator 108.in a suinmation circuit 110. The summation of th interlace signal with the staircase voltage produces six different level staircase signals which permit the tracker to olJcrate or any one of the vertical interlace positions and not just on the same interlace field each frame. The point on the staircase which represents the center of the vertical gate is referenced to ground by summing the staircase with the vertical gate position signal Pv in a summation circuit 112.The output signal from the summation circuit 112 is applied ill parallel to the sianal input terminals of three comparators 113 through 115. ComparatorEMI15.2 tb SEP J .Y tb has tb a gate width voltage signal applied to a reference terminal thereof and the output signal therefrom assumes a predetermined high level voltaic state during the time period that the input signal is greater in magnitude than the reference signal. The gate width voltage signal will be explained in greater detail subsequently but for now it will be sufficient to note that this signal determines the time duration or the size of the tracking gates and in accordance with the principles of the subject invention varies as a function of the target image size.The gate width control voltage, is also applied through a conventional inverter amplifier 12C to a referenced input terminal of the comparator 113. It will be recalled that a portion of the stRirstep signal at the output terminal of the summation circuit 112 had been referenced to ground by sunning the output signal of the swemation circuit 110 and the vertical position signal Pv The signal at the output of the summation circuit 112 is applied to a signal input terminal of the corilparator 113 which is referenced to the gate width voltage after phase inversion through the inverter l20.The signal at the output terminal of the comparator 113 will be at a high level voltage EMI16.1 state during t e time period that the input signal applied thereto has a greater amplitude than the referenced signal. The output signal of the comparator 113 which is designated the leading edge of the vertical gate LEVG is shown by a waveform 118 of FIG. 3.Also the signal at the output terminal of the summation circuit 112 is applied to a signal input terminal of a comparator 115 that has a fixed reference. voltage applied to the comparator reference circuit. For example, ground potential could be applied to the reference terminal of the comparator 115 so that when the input signal exceeds the reference or ground potenti S the output signal of comparator 115 switches to the high . voltage state.The output signal from the comparator 115 is dnated center of vertical gate CVG and is shown by a waveform 122 of FIG. 3.The output signal from the summation circuit 112 is also applied to a signal input terminal of a comparator 114 which has the gate width voltage applied to the reference circuit thereof and the output signal of the comparator 114 assumes the high voltage level state during the time period that the input signal thereto has a greater amplitude than the gate width voltage signal. The output signal of comparator, 114, which is designated trailing edye of the vertical gate TEVG , is shown by a waveform 124 of FIG. 3. The output signal of the comparator 115 is inverted in polarity in the inverter amplifier 126, the output. terminal of which is coupled to a first input terminal of an AND gate 128. A second input terminal of the AND gate 128 is coupled to the output terminal of the comparator 113. The output signal of the AND gate 128 is shown by waveformEMI16.2 tb Hof tb FIG. 3 and is designated the uppor gate UG . As may be seen from. FIG. 3, the upper gate is t the high level state during the time period between the leading edge of the vertical gate and the center of the vertical gate.the output circuit of the comparator 115 is also coupled to a first input terminal of an AND gate 130. A second input terminal of the ND gate 130 is coupled to the output circuit of the comparator 114 and the output signal therefrom is designated the lower gate KI,G and is shown by a waveform 132 of FIG. 3. As may be noted r.rom FIG. 3, the lower gate signal is at the high level voltage state during the time period between the occurrence of the leading dge of the center gate signal and the trailing edge of gate signal. Phe upper UG and lower LG gate signals are applied to the input terminals of an OR gate 131. The output signal from the OR, gate 131, designated vertical gate VG , is at the high level voltage state during both the upper and lower vertical gating periods. The upper gate signal at the output of the AND gate 128 is differentiated in aEMI17.1 tb SEP lfeueclrtTap tb conventIonal SEP SEP SEP SEP e tb circuit 134, and the positive output signals therefrom trigger a mcnostable multivibrator 136, commonly referred to as e one shot o s .In response to the trigger pulses applied thereto, the one shot circuit 136 produces digital signals of a constant pulse width and the output circuit of the one shot 136 is coupled to e first input terminal ofEMI17.2 tb an SEP H SEP gate tb 138. The signal at the output terminal of the AND gate 130 iG is applied to an input circuit of a conventional differentiator 140. The output signals from the differentiator 140 are applied through an inverter 142 and then to the trigger input circuit of aEMI17.3 SEP Q SEP h SEP o tb moncstahZclmultivibrator tb 144.A second input terminal ofEMI17.4 tb the SEP Hi SEP g SEP ae tb 138 is coupled to the output circuit of the one shot circuit 144. The output signal Of EMI18.1 EMI18.2 tb the SEP Q SEP gate tb 1.38, which is designated vertical background gate VBG , is shown by waveform 141 of FIG. 3 as a pair of digital pulses of constant pulse duration. The first one of the vertical background gate pulses occurs at the time of occurrence of the leading edge of the vertical gate and the second one of said pulses commences at the time of occurrence of the trailing edge of the vertical gate.The vertical background gate signals, at the output terminal of theEMI18.3 tb gate tb 138, are differentiated in a conventional differentiator 146 and the positive portions of the signal from the dfferontiator 146 are transmitted through a diode 148 to an output terminal 150. The output signal at the terminal 150 is cornposed of a pair of vertical crosshair pulses as shown by the waveform 152 of FIG. 3. The first pulse of said pair being coincident with the beginning of the leading edge of the vertical gate and the second pulse of said pair being coincident with the trailing edge of the vertical gate. The horizontal gate signals, which are produced in a, manner similar to that just described for the vertical gating signals will now be explained with reference directed to FIG. 6The truncated sine wave signal, Hr, which is an analog representation of the horizontal position ofEMI18.4 tb theXarway SEP 10, tb is applied to a first input terminal of a summation circuit 160 from the As servo 18 FIG. 1 .A point on the truncated sine wave is rercrenced to ground in the summation circuit 160 by summation therein with the signal The The output signal from the summation circuit 160 is applied in parallel to a group of four comparators 162 through 165 inclusively. The comparator 162 has the gate width voltage Ga signal, after it has been inverted in polarity in an inverting amplifier 166, applied to a reference terminal thereof. The output signal of the comparator 162, which is designated left edge of horIzontal gate LEHG , is at the high voltage level state during the time period that the input signal thereto is greater in amplitude than the reference signal applied to the comparator 162.The signal, left edge of the horizontal gate, is shown by a wavefom 168 of FIG. 7. The comparator 164 has a fixed reference signal, for example ground potential, applied thereto and its output signal designated center of the horizontal gate ClIG is shown hy waveform 170 of FIG. 7. The center of the horizontal gate signal is at the high level voltage state during the time period that the input signal from the summation circuit 160 is greater in amplitude than the reference or ground potential. The comparator 163 has the gate width voltage applied to the reference terminal thereof, and the output signal of the comparator 163, designated right edge of the horizontal gate REJIG , is shown by a waveform 172 of FIG. 7. The right edge of the horizontal gate signal is at the high level voltage state during the time period that the input signal to the comparator 163 is of a greater amplitude than the reference signal applied thereto. The center of the horizontal gate signal is inversed in polarity in an inverter amplifier 173 and combined with the left edge of the horizontal gate in an AND gate 174 to form an output pulse that is at the high level state during the time period commencing with the occurrence of the left edge of the horizontal gate and terminating with the occurrence of the center of the horizontal gate. The output signal of the AND gate 174, which is designated left gate LtG is shown by waveform 176 of FIG. 7.In a similar manner the signal right edje of the horizontal gate and the signal center of the horizontal gate are combined in an AND gate 178 to produce a signal right gate RG which is shown by a waveform 179 of FIG. 7. The left LtG and right RG gating signals are applied to the input termInals of an OR gate 175. The output signal from the OR gate 175, designated horizontal gate HG , is at the high level voltage state during both the left and right gating periods A fixed predetermined negative voltage, applied by voltage supply 180, is summed with the gate width voltage in a summation circuit 182 and the output signal therefrom is applied to the refe3 erìce terminal of the comparator 165.The signal input circuit of the comparator 165 is also coupled to the output circuit of the summation circuit 160. The signal at output terminal of comparator 165 switches to the high level state when the input signal thereto is of a greater amplitude than the preference signal applied Lrom theEMI20.1 SEP LL9Z tb summatfMo r7 tb 182.Due to the summation of the voltage at the output terminal of the voltage supply 180, the signal at the output terminal of the comparator 165 will switch to the high level state a predeterr.lined time period prior to the occurrence of the signal at the output terminal of the comparator 162. Therefore comparator 165 provides a signal that precedes the left edge of the horizontal gate. The output terminal of the comparator 165 is coupled to a conventional differeiator circuit 184 which provide s a positive signal coincident with the leading edge of the input signal applied thereby to.The output signal of the differentiator 134 is applied to a trigger circuit of the one shot circuit 186 which in response thereto generates a constant width pulse the leading edge of whichEMI20.2 is coincident with the leading edge of the signal at the output of comparator 165. The output signal of the comparator 163 right edge of horizontal gate is differentiated in a differentiator 188 and the output signal from the differentiator 188 triggers a one shot circuit 190. The pulses provided by the one shot circuits 186 and 190 are combined in an AND gate 192 to generate the horizontal background gates HBG shown by a waveform 194 of FIG. 7.It will be noted from FIG. 7 that the horizontal background gates are a pair of constant time duration pulses with the first pulse preceding the left horizontal gate and the second pulse occurring subsequent to the occurrence of the right horizontal gate. The horizontal background gate signal is differentiated by a differentiator 196 and the negative pulses at the output terniinal thereof are transmitted by the diode 198 to an inverter amplifier 199 and then applied to an output terminal 20G. Signals at the output terminal 200 are designated horizontal crosshairs Hch and are shown by waveformEMI21.1 tb SEP Ljr L tb SEP x SEP tb t of tb FIG. 7.The hoizota crosshair signals are narrow pulses that coincide with the leading edge of the left horizontal gate and the trailing edge of the right horizontal gate and these signals. As was described previously, the horizontal crosshair signals are applied through the summation circuit 32 FIG. 1 to the display monitor 36 to write thereon the narrow white lines representative of the horizontal position of the target gates. The upper tracking gate UTG , the lower tracking gate LTG , the left tracking gate LtG , and the right tracking gate RtG are produced in AND gates 201 through 204 inclusively ofFIG. 7a by cross Aiding the upper lower, right and left gatesEMI21.2 EMI22.1 of FIGS. 5 and 6 with the vertical gateEMI22.2 tb output SEP of SEP 131 tb and horizontal gateEMI22.3 tb output SEP of 175 . tb The function of the signals generated in the AND gates of FIG. 7a is to provide tracking gates for controlling the gates 78 through 81 of PIG. 1. It should be noted that the tracking gate signals occur exclusively during the suh areas i, j, k and 1, shown on screen 40 of FiG. 1, of the scanned raster. The circuits for the mechanization of the gated area current and gate width voltage signals will now be explained in detail with reference to FIG. 8. The digital target signals at the output terminal 77 of the gate 76 FIG. 1 are applied in parallel to a pair of gate circuitsEMI22.4 tb and tb 205. The gateEMI22.5 tb è tb is activatecl by the upper tracking gate and the gate 205 by the lower tracking gate.The output signal of gatesEMI22.6 tb bJand tb 205 are combined in an OR gate 206 the output of which is coupled to an integrator 208. The voltage at the output terminal of the integrator 208, which is proportional to the square root of the image area of the designated target, is applied through a terminal 210 of a switch 212 to a first input terminal of a summation NeTw K circuit 214. An output circuit of the summation network 214 is coupled to a signal input terminal of a gate 216 which, in response to the update gating signal, transmits the signal to the input circuit of an integratorEMI22.7 SEP o 7 tb hand tb discharges the integrator 208. The gate width voltage GWV signal at the output the integratorEMI22.8 tb s tb proportional to the width of the tracking gates. Th gae width voltage is processed by an area gate circuit 220 in such a manner that the output gated area current GAC there from is an inverse function of the gate width voltage applied EMI23.1 thereto. Circuits that provide an output current proportional to the inverse of an input voltage signal are well known in the art, and may be accomplished by a shaping network consisting of a plurality of diodes connected to different appropriate voltages in the emitter of a transistor whose base is connected to the previously mentioned input voltage signal.The output signal from the integratorEMI23.2 tb the tb also applied through a conventional inverting amplifier 222 to a second input circuit of the summation network 214 in a conventional feedback arrangement. A third input signal to the svJIGIdation network 214 is coupled throuah a switchEMI23.3 tb L..Ngg03n SEP R tb 218 which is controlled by the update gating signal UDG applied thereto. The input signal terminal of a comparator 221 is coupled to the output circuit of the integrator 208 and a reference circuit of the comparator is connected to a fixed voltage source 224.The comparator 221 senses when the voltage level at the output of the integrator 208, which indicates target size, is less than the voltage supplied from the source 224 and then gates in the voltage from the output of the comparator 221 thereby enlarging the tracking gate size. The circuits for generating the update gating signal will now be described with reference directed principally to FIG. 9.EMI23.4 tb The SEP signal SEP VI, SEP which SEP is SEP an SEP analog SEP representation SEP of SEP the SEP elevation tb interlace SEP scan SEP pattern SEP of SEP the SEP 9R SEP tilg7LeC.T3a SEP 10 SEP FIG. SEP 2 , tb SEP waveforrry i4 tb is applied in parallel to a pair of comparators 226 and 228.A fixed voltage signal V3 is applied as a reference signal to the eolnparator 226 and a fixed voltage signal Vq is applied as a reference to the comparator 228. The signal V3 is selected to be slightly more positive than the interlace voltage signal represeata EMI24.1 tive of a selected elevation scan interlace level, for example, interlace level 3 ofEMI24.2 tb wave SEP f SEP form tb of FIG. 2. The signal V4 may be selected to be slightly less positive than a second selected scan interlace level, fo example, interlace level 4.The output signal from the comparator 226 will be at the high level voltage state during the time period that the input signal VI is less positive than the signal V31. The output signal from the comparator 228 will be at the high level state during the time period that the signal V1 is greater than the referenced level V4 . The output circuits of the comparators 226 and 228 are combined in an AND gate 230 and the signal at the output terminal of the AND gate will be at a high level state only during the selected interlace scan periods, for example, interlace periods No. 3 and No, 4 for the just described mechanization.The output signal from the tnD gate 230 is transmitted through a gate 232 to the input circuit of a differentiator 234 in response to the enabling signal HA. The negative signals at the output terminal of the differentiator 234 are coincident in time with the termination of the horizontal active period during the interlace scans 3 and 4EMI24.3 tb see SEP waveforms SEP tb of FIG. 2 and is transmitted through the diode 236 to a trigger input circuit of a one shot multivibrator 238. The output signal from the oneshot 238 is the update gating signal which controls the updating time periods of the output integrators 100 and 104 FIG. 1 and which controls the integration timing of gates 216 and 218 FIG. 8 . The system of the subject invention has two modes of operation, acquisition and track which will be described with reference directed primarily to FIGS. 1 and 10. The integration arrangement of FIG. 10 may be utilized for both output integrate 100 and 104 of FIG. 1, and will be explained relative to inte grater 104. In the trac mode of operation switches 252 and 2 of FIG. 10 are in the position thereshown. The output signal from gate 102 FIG. 1 is applied to an input terminal 250 and then transmitted through the switch 254 to an input junction 256 of an operational amplifier 258. The capacitor 262 is coupled between the junction point 255 and an output terminal 260 of the operational amplifier 258 to form a conventional integrator arrangement.The signal at the output terminal 260 therefore is the integral of the input signal applied to the terminal 250.In the acquisition mode of operation the switches 252 and 254 are in the opposite positions from these shown in FIG. 10 and a resistor 264 is shunted across the capacitor 262 and the operational amplifier 258. In the just described switching arrangement the operational amplifier acts as a conventional amplifier and the output signal at the terminal 260 is an amplification of the signal applied to the junction point 256 through the switch 254. In the acquisition mode of operation the signal applied to the terminal 256 is coupled from a wiper terminal of a potentiometer 266. Suitable positive and negative voltages are applied to the terminals of the potentiometer 266 and the wiper position is controllable by the operator. It should be noted that switch 252 and resistor 264 may be deleted and a rate acquisition, rather than position acquisition as ju t described, is effected. In the operation of the system of the subJect invention, the detector array 10 FIG. 1 scans a sector EMI26.1 in space in response to the azimuth servo unit 18 and elevation servo unit 24. The received infrared energy is sequentially readout of the detector elements 12 by the electronic scan arrangement of the array multiplexer 28. The received video signals at the output terminal of the array multiplexer 28 are applied through theEMI26.2 tb SEP t Kt tb summation SEP tb 32 to the display monitor 36. t 7hen the output integrators are switched to the acquisition mode of operation, as explained previously relative to FIG. 10, the acquisition potentiometers, such as potentiometer 266 of FIG. 10, control the voltages Ph and Pv at the output terminals of integrators 104 and 100, respectively. The signals Pv and Ph are applied to the gate generator and crosshair generating circuits of FIGS. 5 and 6 and the vertical crosshair signal Vch and the horizontal crosshair signal Hch are applied through the summation circuit 32 FIG. 1 to the display monitor 36.The operator adjusts the potentiometers, such as 266 of FIG. 10, until the desired target image is within the area formed by the incur section of the crosshairs on the screen 40 of theEMI26.3 tb zJI9 çgJ tb displayl36 tb at which time the opexator switches the output integrators to the track mode of operation. As will be recalled from the previous discussion, in the track mode of operation the signalsPh and Pv are controlled by the updating current transmitted through the gates 1G2 and 98, respectively.However, prior to the arrival of the first update gate signal to the gates 102 and 98, the previous acquisition value of the signals Ph and Pv, that are held by the output integrators, still control the positions of the tracking gate generated in the circuits shown in FIGS. S, 6 and 7a. The received video signals that are readou26 of the array elements through the array multiplexer 28 are processed by the video processor 54, the mechanization of which is shown in FIG. 4. Referring momentarily to FIG. d, the horizontal bacl ground gates and the vertical background gates, which are generated in the circuitry of FIGS . 5 and 6, control the samplin of the received video signals during portions of the array scan outside of the gated tracking area.The sampled signal level is then held and compared against the received video read out of the array multiplexer 28 and digital target signals are.generaLed when the received video is hotter or colder than the sampled background signal depending on the position of the switch 72 FIG. 4 . It should be noted that the horizontal background gates and the vertical background gates have constant pulse s7ic,t h or time durations and therefore their mean sampled value does not have to be compensated for as the tracking gates size varies in response to a change in a target image size.Although the video processor 54 of FIG. 1 utilizes a background reference processing technique, it should be noted that th principles o the invention are not limited to this type of video processor.For example a mean level processor which determines the mean value of the video within the tracking gates and which generates a signal when the video is hotter or colder than the mean level. However the time constant of the mean level detector would have to be compensated for as the target image size changes. Also a target reference processor could be utilized in which tie video level of the target is sampled and held and the video is compared to the level of the target. In a target referenced processor operator selection of hot or cold target is eliminated, ozever, the acquisition procedure becomes more difficult since the sampling gates must be positioned over the target. Also with the target reference processing technique, maximum tracking rates are reduced since the most desirable position within the gate for the sampling time to occur is in the center of the gate and the tracker may lose a target if the target is in the gate hut not at the center thereof. Still referring principally to FIG. 1, the digital tart cut signals at the output terminal 74 of the video processor 54, control the gate 76 which in response thereto applies the gated area current in parallel to the gates i8 through 81. The circuitry for the generation of the gated area current was described previously relative to FIG. 8 and it is important to note that this current decreases inversely proportional to the square root of the tracking gate area and therefore in inverse propoI.tion to the square root of the target image size.Due to the fact that in accordance with the principles of the subject invention the gain of the tracker is compensated for as the target size increases or blooms stability problems that are encountered in prior art trackers are substantially reduced.Signals representative of the target s image area to the left and the right of the position Ph are formed at the output of intccjrators 94 and 90, respectively, and any difference there between is applied from the summation circuit 92 through the gate 102 to update the horizontal output integrator 104 and to correct the value of the output signal Ph. In a similar manncr, signals representative of the target image area above and below a EMI29.1 reference position Pv are formed at the output terminals of integrators 86 and 82 respectively.Any difference between the just stated areas is represented by ,a signal at the output of summation circuit 84, which signal is transmitted through the gate 98 to update the vertical output integrator 1.00 and thereby correct the value of P . In the embodiment described v herein a raster one frame time is scanned in six interlaced fields and sufficient information may be acctunulated for example after three fields to allow the output integrators to be updated and to position the tracking gates to a new position in a reliable fashion.Therefore every three fields, the update gate generating logic circuit of FIG. 9 provides a signal to update the output integrators by actuation of the gates 102 and 98 of FIG. 1. The updating gating signal allows the fast integrators to discharge into the output integrators so that the fast integrators are now ready to accept new tracking inforlaatioll. It may be observed from the update gating signal waveform 21 ofFIG. 2 that the integrators are updated between horizontal active scan periodsEMI29.2 tb waveforzlJ SEP e SEP , tb FIG. 2 so as not to interfere wi.tll tl e data acquisition rate of the system. The signal from the fast integrators is transferred as an incremental current to the output integrators whose stored value represents the gate s center position as of the last sampling interval. This gate position is fed back to the gate generating circuit and also to the other circuits that require the position of the center of the gateS It should be noted that in the circuits shown inPIGS. 5 and 6 that the positions of the leading and trailing e t EMI30.1 of the tracking gates are controlled as a function of the gate width voltage and therefore the width or time duration of the tracking gates is controlled by the gate width voltage.This feature, of having the width of the tracking gates automatically controlled, is a very,important aspect of the improved performance of the system of the subject invention.It will be recalled, relative to the discussion of the circuitry of FIG. 8, that the output signal of the integrator 208 is representative of the linear dimension of the designated target image. This voltage is subtracted from the previously derived gate width voltage and any difference therebetween is gated through the gate 216 to update the gate width voltage integratorEMI30.2 tb SEP aaaaa SEP tb aaaaaa SEP tb that the size of the tracking gates are maintained slightly larger than the size of the target being tracked.Also, it will be recalled from the discussion of the circuits relative to FIG. 8 that by operation of ganged switches 212EMI30.3 tb and tb the operator may manually control the magnitude of. the gate width voltage and therefore the size of the tracking gates. Also, it is important to note that the circuitry, including the comparator 221 and the gate 218, senses when the signal from integrator 208 represents a target area that is smaller than a predetermined target size and increases the size of the tracking gates until the target image size sensed at the output of the integrator 208, is above the minimum predetermined value.The function performed by this circuit is important if due to a sudden transitory change in the image size of the target, the target image cxceeds the size of the tracking gates causing the operation of the background referenced video processor to temporarily become unreliable.In the just descx ecl circumstance, it is possible that no digital target signals will be generated resulting in an unreliable tracking condit .ioi.. IIowever, in the system of the subject invention this momentary problem is sensed, by the circuitry including the comparator 221, as a smaller than practical target image size and the gate 218 is actuated to increase the tracking gate size until the tracking gate is larger than the target at which time the gate 218 is closed. The voltage Ph at the output terminal of the horizontal integrator 104, is applied to a signal input terminal of the azimuth servo unit 18 which unit in response thereto positions the horizontal center of the raster designated 42 on the screen 40 of FIG. 1 into coincidence with the center of the designated target indicated by the nmncral 52 of FIG. 1 . In a similar manner, the output signal of the vertical integrator 100, Pv, is applied to a signal input terminal of the elevation servo 24 and in response to the signal Pv the elevation servo positions the center of the elevation scan such that it is coincident with the center of the designated target.However, for applications involving high tracking rates the servo units may be limited by stability criteria so that they cannot instantaneously center the scanned raster on the target. To compensate for the just stated situation the armament control computer 106 receives the signals AZp, and ELp, representative of the location of the center of the scan raster point 42 of FIG. 1 as well as the signals Ph and Pv displacement which are representative of the displacement of the center of the target from the center of the raster. Using this information, the armament control computer, as is well known in the art, computes the line of sight position of the target as well as the line of sight rate of the target relative to the armament reference line of a weapon launch system not shown so as to intercept the designated target. Thus there has been described an infrared automatic tracking system which provides signals in rectangular coordinates px o ori ional to the angular deviation of a target s line of sight from the sensor s optical axis. In addition the tracking system of the subject invention provides tracking gates which arc automatically adaptable to the size of a designated target image and a tracking integrator mechanism that maintains a subo,talltially constant loop gain independent of the target image size. What is claimed is
