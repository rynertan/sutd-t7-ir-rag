## Description
The present invention relates to an optical recording medium having an indophenol group dye as an information recording layer. More particularly, the present invention relates to an optical recording medium for performing recording by the use of the changes in state of material owing to the optical energy of oscillatory wavelength of a semiconductor laser. Various optical recording media have been already known as the media of the kind described above. For example, a medium having a layer of phthalocyanine group dye on the substrate thereof has been disclosed in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 97033 80 the term OPI as used herein means an unexamined published application . The phthalocyanine group dye has disadvantages of low sensitivity, insufficient deposition because of its high decomposing point, or the like. Further, a disadvantage is that the dye cannot be used for coating by application, because its solubility in organic solvent is very low. A medium having a recording layer of phenalene group dye, and a medium having a recording layer of naphthoquinone group dye have been disclosed in Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 83344 83 and 224793 83, respectively. Such dyes have an advantage of easily depositing but reversely have a disadvantage of a low reflectivity. Because of the low reflectivity, the contrast relating to the reflectivity between a portion recorded by a laser beam and a non recording portions becomes low, thereby making it difficult to reproduce recorded information. In addition, organic dyes generally have a disadvantage of low preservative stability. An object of the present invention is to provide an optical recording medium using a dye being capable of depositing easily, being high soluble in organic solvent, being capable of coating by an application, having a high reflectivity, and being superior in contrast as well as in preservative stability. The gist of the present invention exists in an optical recording medium in which recording and or reproducing is made by the state changes of material owing to a laser beam, comprising an indophenol group dye supported on a substrate. The invention includes an optical recording medium comprising an optical recording layer containing an indophenol group dye and being without silver halide supported on a substrate in which recording is made by thermal transformation of the recording layer with laser beams and reproducing is made by reading a difference of a reflectivity between a non transformed portion and a transformed portion, said dye having a formula II in which In a preferred embodiment the indophenol group dyes are represented by general formula III wherein A represents the same meaning defined above, X and Y each represents a hydrogen atom, a C₁ C₄ alkyl group, a C₁ C₄ acylamino group, a C₁ C₄ alkoxy group, or a halogen atom, R⁷ and R⁸ each represents a hydrogen atom, a C₁ C₈ alkyl group, an aralkyl group, a cyanoalkyl group, or a group represented by C₂H₄O Further preferred embodiments of the present invention are the optical recording media according to the claims 3 to 7. In the present invention, general synthesis of the indophenol group dye supported on the substrate can be made, for example, in the manner as disclosed in the description by P.W. Vittum and G.E. Brown, J. Am. Soc. Chem., While the optical recording medium of the present invention is basically constituted of a substrate and a recording layer, a subbing layer may be provided on the substrate or a protection layer may be provided on the recording layer if necessary. Any of materials transparent or opaque with respect to the laser beam used can be employed for the substrate of the present invention. Examples of the materials of the substrate are supports for general recording materials, such as glass, plastic, paper, plate like or foil like metal, and the like. The preferred is plastic in view of various aspects. Examples of the plastic include acrylic resin, methacrylic resin, vinyl acetate resin, vinyl chloride resin, nitrocellulose, polyethylene resin, polypropylene resin, polycarbonate resin, polyimide resin, polysulfone resin, etc. In the case that the indophenol group dye is used as an information recording layer in the optical recording medium of the present invention, the film thickness thereof ranges from 100 Å to 5 µm, preferably from 1000 Å to 3 µm. With respect to the method of making the film, general methods for making thin film, such as a vacuum deposition method, a sputtering method, a doctor blade coating method, a cast coating method, a spinner coating method, a dip coating method, etc., can be used in the invention. If necessary, a binder can be used. Examples of the binder used include known materials, such as PVA, PVP, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, polyvinylbutyral, polycarbonate, etc. It is desired that the weight proportion of the indophenol group dye to the resin is 0.01 or more. In the case that a spinner coating method is used as a method of making film, the rev number is preferably from 500 to 5000 rpm, and if necessary, a treatment such as heating or applying solvent steam may be made after spin coating. To improve stability and light durability of the recording medium, the medium may contain transition metal chelate compounds as singlet oxygen quencher, for example, acetyl acetonate chelate, bisphenyldithiol, salicylaldehyde oxime, bisdithio α diketone, etc. Further, if necessary, other dyes can be used in combination. Examples of the other dyes are other indophenol group dyes, and different group dyes, such as triarylmethane group dyes, azo dyes, cyanine group dyes, squalillium group dyes, etc. With respect to solvent in the case where the recording layer is produced by the above mentioned methods, that is, a doctor blade coating method, a cast coating method, a spinner coating method, a dip coating method, etc., particularly in the spinner coating method, solvent having a boiling point of from 120 C to 160 C is preferably used. Examples of the solvent include bromoform, dibromoethane, ethylcellosolve, xylene, chlorobenzene, cyclohexanone, etc. The recording layer in the optical recording medium of the present invention may be formed on both sides of the substrate or may be provided to only on one side of the substrate. Recording information onto the recording medium thus obtained is made by the radiation of focused laser beams, more preferably semiconductor laser beams, of about 1 µm to the double side or single side of the recording layer. Thermal transformation in the recording layer owing to the absorption of laser energy, such as decomposition, evaporation, melt or the like, occurrs on a portion irradiated with the laser beams.
