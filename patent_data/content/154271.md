# RADIATION SHIELDING PUTTY LIKE COMPOSITION

## Abstract
The present invention discloses a radiation shielding putty like composition comprising a binder having a fluidity in the range from at least 5,000 c.St. in viscosity at 25 C to at least 100 in unworked penetration at 25 C, and 1,200 to 4,000 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the said binder, of an inorganic powder having a density of at least 5 g cm³ and also having a particle size such that at least 95 by weight thereof passes a 145 mesh sieve, and the said composition being from 1 to 35 mm in consistency and at least 1 g 5sec. in extrudability, and at least 4 g cm³ in density.
