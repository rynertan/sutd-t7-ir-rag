# Connector for optical fiber.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a connector 5 for permanent attachment to an optical fiber 1 , as well as to a method for the production of the connector 5 and various types of adapters 33, 34 for mating with the connector 5 . Specifi cally, the invention relates to a plug in connector 5 for attachment to an end of a light conducting cable including an optical fiber 1 surrounded by a sheathing 3 . The connector 5 is preferably formed of a plastic material cast around the cable and holding the optical fiber 1 in the center of the connector 5 . The connector 5 is formed as a plug in connector to be used where the information transmission occurs at a comparatively low tolerance level and is formed from a one piece, injection moulded plastic part 7 . The connector 5 is injection moulded around the fiber 1 while the fiber 1 is centrally held in an injection moulding die and projects out from the sheathing 3 . The connector 5 extends over a part of the sheathing 3 which is joined to it by moulding The invention is also concerned with a coupling into which two of the above described connectors 5 can be inserted and various adapters 33, 34 which engage with the connector 5 .
