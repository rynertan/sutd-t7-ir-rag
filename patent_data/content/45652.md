# MOORING OF FLOATING STRUCTURES

## Abstract
A method of installing a permanent vertical tethering element 30 between a floating structure 10 and an anchor means 20 said method comprising steps of providing on said anchor means an upward opening guide funnel 108 located above a connector means 102 for connecting a lower end 118 of said permanent vertical tethering element to said anchor means temporarily mooring said floating structure to said anchor means with a plurality of substantial ly vertical temporary mooring lines 18 held in tension by a buoyancy of said structure, while said floating structure is temporarily moored, lowering said permanent vertical tethering element from said floating structure until said lower end thereof is located a relatively short distance above said anchor means observing, with an underwater televi sion camera, a location of said lower end of said permanent vertical tethering element relative to said guide funnel of said anchor means moving said lower end of said permanent vertical tethering element laterally as necessary to position it above said guide funnel stabbing said lower end of said permanent vertical tethering element into said guide funnel guiding, by means of said guide funnel, said lower end of said permanent vertical tethering element into engagement with said connector means and connecting said lower end of said permanent vertical tethering element to said connec tor means.
