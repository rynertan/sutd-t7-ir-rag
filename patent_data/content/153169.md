# USE OF PNICTIDE FILMS FOR WAVE GUIDING IN OPTO ELECTRONIC DEVICES

## Abstract
An electro optical device characterised in that it com prises A a semiconductor body and B at least one pnictide rich layer for guiding light waves in the said body is disclosed. Referring to the accompanying diagram, an electro opti cal device 20 may comprise a semiconductor body 22 and pnictide rich layers 24 and 26. The semiconductor layer of an opto electronic device has one or more films of a pnictide rich material deposited thereon. The pnictide has a smaller reflective index than the semicon ductor layer. These films provide a wave guiding effect to light within the semiconductor layer in opto electronic devices, such as solid state lasers and light emitting diodes and wave guides interconnecting such devices. The invention provides advantages over the prior art.
