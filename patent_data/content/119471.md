## Description
The present invention pertains to an active hydrogen containing composition which provides mold release properties to a molded article and a process for preparing molded polymeric products from the active hydrogen containing composition. Polyether polyurethane moldings are being increasingly used in the manufacture of automobiles, furniture and in home construction. Molded polyether polyurethanes are especially important because they are lightweight and are resistant to moisture, weather, temperature extremes, and aging. As an illustration, molded polyether polyurethane elastomers have become of special interest in the manufacture of force reducing impact media such as safety impact bumpers for automotive vehicles and impact resistant automotive fascia. The high demand for molded polyether polyurethane articles requires that they be produced in the largest numbers in the shortest possible time. Polyurethane forming mixtures are eminently suited for mass production because the reactants are liquid, that is they are pumpable, and are quick reacting. The problem has existed, however, in providing adequate mold release in the shortest possible time to take fullest advantage of the unique capabilities of the polyurethane systems. Heretofore, release of molded articles from molds in which they have been formed has been achieved by coating the surface of the mold cavity with an agent which facilitates release of the molded article from the walls of the mold cavity. Procedures such as this are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,694,530, 3,640,769, 3,624,190, 3,607,397 and 3,413,390. This method has certain disadvantages. The agent, after molding, adheres to the surface of the molded article thereby removing such from the surface of the mold. As the mold release agent is removed from the mold surface, it must therefore be replaced so as to provide continued release of the molded articles from the mold. The necessity for repeated additions of mold release agent results in higher costs due to low productivity as a result of the additional time incurred in applying such additional quantities of mold release agents to the mold surfaces. In addition, mold build up may become a problem, since a fine film of urethane is left in spot areas of the mold surface. This build up on the surface of the mold cavity walls eventually covers and obscures any detail on the mold cavity surface desired to be imparted to the molded article. Also, the presence of the release agent adhering to the surface of the molded article can impede subsequent operations on the article, such as painting or adhering operations. Additionally, the need to reapply the release agent after each molding or a limited number of moldings interrupts the molding operation and slows down output. The use of internal mold release agents for use in molding polyurethane articles has been disclosed by Boden et al in U.S. 3,726,952, Godlewski in U.S. 4,024,088, Bonin et al in U.S. 4,098,731, Sparrow et al in U.S. 4,130,698, Godlewski in U.S. 4,111,861, Kleimann et al in U.S. 4,201,847 and Godlewski in U.S. 4,220,727. Some of these internal mold release agents bleed or creep to the surface of the molded article. Some of these articles can not be painted even after appropriate preparation steps for painting has been done. Others are incompatible with polyether polyols. Most of them seriously reduce the activity of the catalyst. Almost all show degradation of physical properties such as reduced elongation. The use of the salts described in U.S. Patent 3,726,952 has not provided effective release agents for reaction injection molding RIM . While showing release characteristics per se, their use in a screening program wherein hand mixed formulations are cast into an open mold has been found to have other serious problems, namely 1 degradation of the tin catalyst employed in the formulation, 2 excessively long gel and cure time, and 3 poor physical properties. These problems are believed to be caused by the presence of free carboxylic acid. It is released from the salt by the reaction of the amine with the isocyanate, and it is believed that the presence of these free carboxylic acids, or any acid, interferes with the cure rate of the hydroxyl isocyanate reaction to form a urethane structure as disclosed in The reactivity or catalyst kill problem can be overcome to a certain degree by using tertiary amines in place of primary or secondary amines. Both U.S. Patents 3,726,952 and 4,098,731 describe this technique. Since isocyanates cannot react with tertiary amines the salt cannot be split it thus remains neutral the carboxylic acid is not free , hence, catalyst kill does not seem evident. The use of tertiary amines, however, often shows bleed out or exudation problems which in turn result in poor paint adhesion. Further, retention of physical properties is seldom possible because of either excess reactivity when using very catalytically active amines, or because of plasticizer effects brought about by excessively long tertiary amine molecules. The technology of U.S. Patent 4,111,861 states that polar metal compounds can be employed to overcome catalyst kill problems brought on by the presence of fatty carboxylic acids. It states that metal ions must be present in an amount sufficient to neutralize the acid. Reference is made to the use of the Bi, Pb, Na, Li, and K ion, with sodium carbonate, sodium oleate, and potassium laurate being exemplified. They also show sodium oleate alone to be an effective release agent. When evaluated in RIM polyol systems as a single additive, it failed to show adequate release characteristics in a screening program wherein hand mixed formulations were cast into an open mold. Dominquez et al. in U.S. Patent 4,396,729 teach a method of making a reaction injection molded elastomer by injecting two streams via a RIM machine into a molded cavity of the desired configuration. The first stream contains amine terminated polyethers of greater than 1500 molecular weight, an amine terminated chain extender and, as an internal mold release agent, a dimethyl siloxane with organic acid groups. The second stream contains an aromatic polyisocyanate. Zinc stearate has long been known to be an effective release agent for most thermoplastics. It is also used in polyester sheet molding compounds. When evaluated in RIM polyol systems containing only hydroxyl groups as the active hydrogen containing source, zinc stearate as a single additive failed to show adequate release characteristics in a screening program wherein hand mixed formulations were cast into an open mold. Zinc stearate was observed to dissolve in a mixture of oleoyl sarcosine and excess polyoxypropylene diamine of 400 MW and the resultant mixture performed as an effective mold release agent. The present invention provides for an improvement in one or more of the following 1 increased multiple release, 2 increased ease of release, 3 effective and very stable catalyst reactivity, and 4 minimally altered physical properties in molded parts. One aspect of the present invention pertains to an active hydrogen containing composition which provides mold release properties to a molded article prepared from the composition and a polyisocyanate, a polyisothiocyanate or a mixture thereof by a RIM process. The invention is characterized in that the composition consists of Another aspect of the present invention pertains to a process for preparing molded polymeric products which comprises mixing and injecting into a suitable mold a polyisocyanate, a polyisothiocyanate or a mixture thereof as the A side component and an active hydrogen containing composition as the B side component characterized by employing as the B side component the aforementioned active hydrogen containing composition. The term polymer as employed herein means those polymers containing urea and optionally urethane groups. By the term lipophilic as employed herein it is meant that the material contains an R CH₃ group wherein R is a saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group having at least 6 carbon atoms. Any reference herein to the Periodic Table of the Elements refers to that published by Sargent Welch Scientific Company as catalog number S 18806, 1968. Suitable carboxylic acids and the metal salts thereof, components C and A , respectively, useful in the active hydrogen containing composition are materials according to the definition in claim 1. Particularly suitable carboxylic acids include, for example, oleic acid, lauric acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, and mixtures thereof.

These amido carboxylic acids can be prepared by the Schotten Baumann acylation reaction wherein an acyl halide is reacted with an amino acid. Component A and preferably component C , when present, contains at least one terminal or pendant saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon group having from 8 to 22 carbon atoms when said material contains an amido group or from 10 to 22 carbon atoms when said material does not contain an amido group.

Also, mixtures of the acids and metal salts of the acids which are available commercially can be employed when partially reacted, complexed or associated materials are desired. Likewise commercially available metal salts of the acids or amido acids can be employed when the totally reacted, complexed or associated materials are desired.

Also suitable are the corresponding polyisothiocyanates. The polymers can be prepared either in the presence or absence of a conventional catalyst other than A . Those polymers prepared from amine containing polyols do not usually require a catalyst although catalysts can be employed if desired. On the other hand, those polymers prepared from polyols which do not contain nitrogen atoms are prepared in the presence of a catalyst. Suitable catalysts which may be employed herein include, for example, tertiary amines, alkali metal alkoxides, or mixtures thereof. Suitable amine catalysts include, for example, triethylenediamine, triethylamine, tetramethylbutanediamine, N,N dimethylethanolamine, N ethylmorpholine, bis 2 dimethylaminoethyl ether, N methylmorpholine, N ethylpiperidine, 1,3 bis dimethylamino 2 propanol, N,N,N ,N tetramethylethylenediamine, or mixtures thereof.

Preferably, these urethane catalysts are in liquid form, but if they are inherently a solid at the application temperature, then they may be dissolved in an appropriate liquid, such as, for example, dipropylene glycol or they may be dissolved or dispersed in one of the components. The catalysts other than A , when employed, can be employed in quantities of from 0.001 to 5, preferably from 0.01 to 1 part per 100 parts of total polyol employed depending upon the activity of the catalyst. Very weak catalysts could possibly be employed in quantities above 5 parts per 100 parts of polyol. If desired, the polyurethanes can be modified so as to contain isocyananurate or thioisocyanurate groups by employing relatively high NCO or NCS to active hydrogen ratios, e.g. greater than 1.5 1, preferably greater than 2 1, and employing a trimerization catalyst. Suitable trimerization catalysts which can be employed herein include, for example, the zwitterions disclosed by Kresta and Shen in U.S. 4,111,914 and the tertiary amines, alkali metal salts of lower alkanoic acids, or mixtures thereof as disclosed in U.S. 4,126,741 Carleton et al . The zwitterions can also function as a catalyst for urethane formation, i.e. the NCX OH reaction. If desired, the densities of the polymers produced herein can be reduced by incorporating a blowing agent into the formulation. Suitable such blowing agents are fully described in U.S. 4,125,487 and in U.S. 3,753,933. Particularly suitable blowing agents include, for example, the low boiling halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride and trichloromonofluoromethane. Another suitable method for reducing the density is by frothing by injecting an inert gas into the mixture of polymer forming components. Suitable such inert gases include, for example, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, xenon, helium, or mixtures thereof such as air. If desired, cell control agents can be employed, particularly when preparing foams or microcellular products of reduced density and or to assist in paintability of the polyurethane. Suitable cell control agents which can be employed herein include silicone oils such as, for example, DC 193, DC 195, DC 197 and DC 198 commercially available from Dow Corning Corp. SF 1034, PFA 1635, PFA 1700 and PFA 1660 commercially available from General Electric Co. L 520, L 5320 and L 5340 commercially available from Union Carbide Corp. and B 1048 commercially available from PH. Goldschmidt, AG., or mixtures thereof. The polymeric products may additionally contain, if desired, coloring agents, fire retardant agents, fillers, or modifiers. Suitable liquid and solid modifiers include those disclosed and described in U.S. Patents 4,000,105 and 4,154,716. However, any such modifier described therein which fulfills the definition of any of the other components as described in this application are not considered as modifiers but rather as one of the components of the present invention. Particularly suitable as the modifier or filler substances are fiberglass reinforcement fibers, particularly those having lengths of from about 1 16 inch 1.6 mm to about 1 2 inch 12.7 mm and milled glass fibers having a maximum length of 1 16 inch 1.6 mm , 1 8 inch 3.2 mm and 1 4 inch 6.4 mm . Other particularly suitable fillers are mica and wollastonite. The components which react to form the polymeric products can be shaped or formed into useful articles by injecting the reactive mixture into molds which are capable of withstanding the exotherm of the polymerizing mass and are non reactive with and are insoluble when in contact with the liquid reactive mixture. Particularly suitable molds are those made of metal such as aluminum, copper, brass, or steel. In some instances non metal molds can be employed such as those made of, for example, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, or silicone elastomers. Particularly suitable injection methods for RIM applications include those disclosed in a paper entitled THE BAYFLEX 110 SERIES THE NEW GENERATION OF RIM MATERIALS , by W. A. Ludwico and R. P. Taylor presented at the SOCIETY OF AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEERS PASSENGER CAR MEETING, Detroit, Michigan, September 26 30, 1977 a paper entitled THE PROPERTIES OF HIGH MODULUS RIM URETHANES , by R. M. Gerkin and F. E. Critchfield presented at the above meeting British Patent No. 1,534,258 titled PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ELASTOMERIC POLYURETHANE POLYUREA MOULDED PRODUCTS HAVING A COMPACT SURFACE SKIN and a book by F. Melvin Sweeney entitled INTRODUCTION TO REACTION INJECTION MOLDING, Technomics, Inc., 1979. When injecting a relatively rapid setting blend into massive metal molds, it may be necessary in order for the molded article to have good surface characteristics to preheat the molds to an appropriate temperature so that the mold will not abstract the heat of polymerization from the reactive mass and inappropriately delay the solidification time expected of a given formulation. On the other hand, thin wall metal molds could exhibit a minimal heat sink effect on relatively large cross section castings and thus, these thin wall metal molds may not require preheating. Following is a list of materials employed in the examples and comparative experiments. wherein x has a value of 5.6. This product has an average amine hydrogen equivalent weight of 100 and is commercially available from Texaco Chemical Co. as JEFFAMINE D 400. wherein x has a value of 33.1. This product has an average amine hydrogen equivalent weight of 500 and is commercially available from Texaco Chemical Company as JEFFAMINE D 2000. The following examples are illustrative of the present invention, but are not to be construed as to limiting the scope thereof in any manner. The reactive mixtures of each formulation were hand mixed with 0.05 parts of Catalyst A, in order to extend reactivity time and also to better separate reactivity differences between the various samples tested. These mixtures were then hand cast into a 4 in. x 12 in. x 1 2 in. 101.6 mm x 304.8 mm x 12.7 mm container made from aluminum foil which had been washed with methylene chloride. After casting, the samples were cured for 60 seconds in an oven at 150 F 65.5 C . Upon removal from the oven attempts were made to pull the aluminum foil from the casting by peeling a 3 in. 76.2 mm wide strip which was made by scoring with razor blades in the long direction of the molded parts. Ease of release was then judged and ranked according to the following scale Reactivity was measured and identified by two separate points 1 cream time and 2 cure time. Cream time is observed as the time at which the mixture of B side active hydrogen containing composition plus A side polyisocyanate goes from liquid to cream, and cure time is observed as the time when the casting becomes tack free. Following the general procedure, various polyurethane forming compositions were prepared and molded. The components and results are provided in Table I. The general procedure was employed using various components. The components except the isocyanate were blended together and stored for various periods of time at 23 C prior to mixing with the polyisocyanate and molding. The compositions and results are provided in the following Table IV. The general procedure followed in Examples 1 through 40 and Comparative Runs A through T is only a rough screening test. The results observed from hand mixed formulations are not always duplicated by machine mixed formulations. Formulations prepared by machine mixing typically employ either low pressure mechanical mixing or high pressure impingement mixing. These examples and comparative runs employed a production model Krauss Maffei PU 40 reaction injection molding machine. The mold was a Steel Plaque Tool, 22 x 26 x 1 8 558.8 mm x 660.4 mm x 3.175 mm . The mold surface was cleaned and then waxed and buffed 3 times. The conditions employed were as follows The components and results are provided in the following Table V. These examples and comparative run employed a different RIM production machine Cincinnati Milicron RIM 90 and an actual prototype part. The conditions employed were as follows The plaque mold was constructed of P 20 tool steel. The mold surface was cleaned using Slide Mold Cleaner commercially available from Percy Harms Corp. . No subsequent treatment was made prior to molding. 93 parts by weight Polyol B 93 lbs 42.2 kg of Polyol B was weighed into the polyol tank of an Admiral 400 2HP reaction injection molding RIM machine, to it was then added 7 lb 3.2 kg of Polyetheramine A and 18 lbs 8.2 kg of Diamine A. The tank was then closed and pressured 9 psi, 62 kPa with dry nitrogen. The stirrer in the tank was turned on, then the low pressure pump, and then the high pressure pump. The fluid was allowed to circulate till a homogeneous solution was obtained, about 40 minutes 2400 s . The system was catalyzed by the addition of 0.1 by weight of the B side of each of the following catalysts, Catalyst A and Catalyst B. The machine was calibrated to give an index of 105 with a B side A side weight ratio of 1.87 using polyisocyanate B as the A side component. Sample plaques were prepared under the following conditions. The shot time was 2 seconds and the demold time was 60 seconds. The parts were shot into a chrome steel plaque mold which made a plaque 14 x 12 x 1 8 356 mm x 305 mm x 3.18 mm and weighed approximately 470 gms. Before any parts were shot the mold was meticulously cleaned with a propriatory mold cleaner and all traces of previous polymer removed. The mold was then dried and polished. There was no further preparation of the mold. 93 parts by weight Polyol B 63 lbs 28.6 kg of Polyol B were weighed into a stainless steel, twenty five gallon 0.095 m³ vessel equipped with heating and stirring. To it was added 7 lbs 3.2 kg Polyetheramine A and 2.5 lbs 1.13 kg of zinc stearate. The mixture was heated to about 85 C with stirring for about 45 minutes 2700 s , after which time a slightly cloudy solution was obtained. The fluid was transferred to the polyol tank of an Admiral 400 2HP RIM machine, and the remainder of Polyol B, 30 lbs 13.6 kg was added along with 18 lbs 8.2 kg of Diamine A. The tank closed pressurized and recirculated as described in Comparative Experiment AB. The system was then catalyzed as in Comparative Experiment AB. The machine conditions and B side A side ratio, index, and isocyanate were the same as in Comparative Experiment AB as was the preparation of the mold. Parts 1 through 16 were prepared and removed from the mold with no evidence of sticking or adhesion to the mold. The surface of the finished plaques was excellent. The trial was arbitrarily concluded at Part 16. The formulation of Example 47 was changed by substituting 2.5 lbs 1.13 kg of zinc laurate for the 2.5 lbs 1.13 kg of zinc stearate. Method of preparation and all other conditions as in Example 47. Parts 1 through 19 were prepared and removed from the mold with no evidence of sticking or adhesion. The trial was arbitrarily concluded at Part 19. Using the method of preparation and machine condition as in Example 47, but using 0.5 lbs 0.23 kg of zinc stearate. Parts 1 through 15 were obtained without sticking or adhesion. The trial was arbitrarily concluded at Part 15. Method of preparation and all other conditions as in Example 47 except that 6 lbs 2.7 kg zinc stearate were added rather than 2.5 lbs 1.13 kg zinc stearate. Parts 1 through 16 were produced without sticking or adhesion to the mold, arbitrarily concluded at Part 16. 93 parts by weight Polyol B The system was prepared as in Comparative Experiment AB, except that Polyol C was used in place of Diamine A. Formulation as in Comparative Experiment AC with the addition of 2.5 lbs 1.13 kg zinc stearate. Method of Preparation as in Example 47 except that Polyol C was used instead of Diamine A. Machine conditions and isocyanate used as in Comparative Experiment AC. Mold preparation was as previously described. Parts 1 12 were prepared with no sticking or adhesion to the mold. The testing was arbitrarily concluded after Part 12. An experiment was conducted employing an Admiral 400 2HP RIM machine and a stainless steel plaque mold measuring 12 in. x 14 in. x 1 8 in. 305 mm x 356 mm x 3.18 mm . The mold was not treated prior to use. The compositions and conditions were as follows Polyisocyanate B was employed in a quantity which provided an NCO Index of 103. 50 pbw Polyetheramine C weight ratio of A side to B side 0.465 1 Prior to the addition of the zinc stearate to the polyol B side , several plaques were made. These plaques required considerable effort to obtain release of the plaque from the mold. After addition of the zinc stearate to the polyol B side formulation, 17 parts were made with no indication of sticking or polymer buildup before the polyol B side ran low on material causing the experiment to be terminated. Some of these parts literally fell out of the mold upon opening of the mold. An experiment was conducted employing an Admiral 400 2HP RIM machine and a stainless steel plaque mold measuring 12 in. x 14 in. x 1 8 in. 305 mm x 356 mm x 3.18 mm . The mold was treated with external mold release on one side of the mold. After the seventh sample, the external mold release was stripped from that side so that the entire mold was bare steel. The composition and conditions were as follows Polyisocyanate B was employed in quantity which provided an NCO index of 103. 100 pbw Polyol B weight ratio of A side to B side was 0.5 1. The formulation provided good release for 17 samples off one bare steel face and 10 releases off both bare steel faces.
