# A telecommunications system.

## Abstract
A telecommunications system is disclosed which is user programmable comprising convenience circuitry for providing a plurality of features which the station telephone sets may not be capable of by themselves. The convenience circuitry comprises a data processor 110 which receives data input from an incoming ringing signal detector 140 , a telephone signal receiver 115 , a dial tone detector 160 of from an associated user activatable data input device 117 . Responsive to the data input, the data processor provides output through a speech processor 150 , a telephone signal generator 116 , a ring generator 119 or through an associated data output device 113 such as a loudspeaker. A peripheral device interface 114 connects data processor 110 to security, utility meter, fire detection, energy control, appliance and other devices.
