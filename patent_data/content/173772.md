# Extruder for foamed liquids.

## Abstract
An extruder 22 for delivering foamed glue from a foamer selectively to a plurality of spaced apart outlet orifices 104 for extrusion onto a substrate surface and to bypass passageways 62 for diverting the foamed glue to a defoamer for subsequent return to the foamer, is formed of three elongated flat blocks 42, 44, 46 secured together releasably in face abutting relationship. The surface of the outer, inlet 42 and bypass 44 blocks facing the center coupling block 46 are recessed to provide a plurality of passageways all of which extend substantially equal dis tances from inlet 52, 54 ,56 and bypass ports 68, 66, 64 in the inlet and bypass blocks, respectively, to a plurality of coupling ports 26 in the coupling block. An air pressure operated selector valve 80, 82 in the bypass block 44 is operable to communicate the coupling ports selectively with the bypass passageways for bypassing foamed glue to the defoamer and with the outlet orifices for extruding foamed onto a substrate surface.
