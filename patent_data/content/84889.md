# Digital radio paging receiver.

## Abstract
The digital radio paging receiver comprises a first memory circuit for storing a first address codeword assigned to said receiver and comprised of a BCH code and a second memory circuit for storing a plurality of codewords, each comprising a BCH code whose informa tion contents differ from said first address codeword only in a small number of specific bits. A code generator performs exclusive OR operation in a time series between the con tents of said second memory circuit and of said first memory circuits, respectively, and provides as its output second address codewords corresponding to said first address codeword. A comparator time serially compares a selective calling signal with said first and second address codewords to provide responsive to the results of comparison an iden tity signal representing the identity of said calling signal with said address codewords. This digital radio paging receiver is capable of detecting multi address codewords with a reduced PROM capacity and a reduced number of shift registers. Furthermore, it can detect multi address codewords and can be made more compact by reducing the number of socket leads for the cord plug.
