## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONSUBSTITUTED BUTYL GUANINES AND THEIR UTILIZATIONIN ANTIVIRAL COMPOSITIONS.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to substituted butyl guanines. These compounds have antiviral activity. The compounds are particularly effective against herpes viruses, e.g. herpes simplex virus. The compounds of the invention may be represented by the formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 is hydroxy, amino or halogen i.e.fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, preferably chlorine and R2 and R3 are independently selected from hydrogen and a phosphate group havina the formula EMI2.2 2 and 3 or Rê and R taken together form a phosphate group having the formula EMI2.3 or a pyrophosphate group having the formulaEMI2.4 wherein R4 and R5 are independently selected from hydrogen, a pharmaceutically acceptable cation e.g.sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, ammonium, or substituted ammonium such as alkylammonium wherein the alkyl group has 1 to 10 carbon atoms , alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, phenyl, phenylalkyl wherein the alkyl moiety has 1 to 6 carbon atoms, phosphate or pyrophosphate. The present invention also relates to important intermediates for preparing the above compounds. For example, compounds of the formula I wherein R1 is benzyloxy, and R2 and R3 are each henzyloxy or are together isopropylidene. In view of the above, it will be seen that one compound of the invention may be represented by the formula EMI3.1 Another compound of the invention may be represented by the formula EMI3.2 In Compound III, it will be seen that R2 and R3 form a phosphate group which taken together with the carbon atoms to which it is attached forms a 1,3,2 dioxaphosphorinane ring. A chemical structure of the Formula II was disclosed by Pandit et al., Synthetic Communications, 2 6 , 345 351 1972 . However, as shown below in the examples, Pandit et al. did not isolate this compound.We have found that the compound that was isolated was actually the chlorhydroxy analogue which is biologically inactive and has the following structure EMI4.1 Pandit s reaction owes prepare both the biologically active compound of the Formula II and the biologically inactive compound of the FormulaIV. The active compound may be isolated by the chromatographic separation disclosed below in theExamples. However, the desired compound of theFormula II is better prepared as shown below EMI4.2 EMI5.1 Compound V, which is also the starting material for the Pandit reaction, is subjected to a preliminary hydrolysis of the 6 chloro substituent to a hydroxyl group followed by catalytic hydrogenation of the benzyl protecting groups. This yields the desired diol as a single component. Preparation of the cyclic phosphate derivative is illustrated hy the following reaction scheme EMI5.2 EMI6.1 EMI7.1 Compound VII is reduced to VIII which is then phosphorylated to give IX as a mixture of cis and trans isomers. Compound IX is then used to phosphorylate benzyl alcohol to form X. The allyl group of X is converted to the desired hydroxyethyl substituent by ozonolysis followed by reduction of the first formed aldehyde to alcohol. Simultaneously, the ozonolysis converts cyclic p111 to pV The product XI which is still a mixture of cis and trans isomers, is converted to its tosyl derivative XII.From this mixture of cis and trans isomers, a single isomer can be separated by crystallization. The single isomer of XII is used to alkylate XIII yielding a mixture of the 9 isomer and 7 isomer which may be separated by chromatography. Deprotection of the desired 9 isomer by hydrogenation yields the biologically active cyclic phosphate monosodium saltXVI. The desired cyclic phosphate XVI may also be prepared by direct phosphorylation of Compound II using orthochlorephenylphosphorodichloridate followed by deprotection by standard hydrogenation conditions, for example hydrogenation with hydrogen gas in the presence of a noble metal catalyst such as palladium or platinum. An easier preparation of Compound II is shown in the following reaction scheme EMI8.1 Compound XVII, which is the cyclic dimethylacetal of Compound VIII, is conveniently prepared from Compound VIII in acetone solution in the presence of an acid catalyst. Compound XVII is converted to the hydroxyethyl derivative XVIII by ozonolysis and reduction in an analogous manner as for the cyclic phosphate XI. Compound XVIII is converted to its tosylate XIX and used to alkylate compound XIII giving a mixture of the 7 isomer and the 9 isomer which may be separated by chromatography. The 9 isomer is first partially deprotected by hydrogenation to remove the 6 benzyl group and is then treated with mild aqueous acid to yield the desired diol II. Yet another convenient preparation ofCompound II is shown in the following reaction scheme EMI9.1 Compound XX, which is the dibenzyl ether ofCompound VIII, is prepared from Compound VIII by alkylating the disodium alcoholate with benzyl bromide in dimethylformamide solution. Compound XX is converted to the hydroxyethyl derivative XXI by ozonolysis and reduction in an analogous manner as for the cyclic phosphate XI. Compound XXI is converted to its tosylate XXII which is used to alkylate Compound XIII giving a mixture of the 7 isomer and the 9 isomer which may be separated by chromatography. The 9 isomer is then deprotected in one step by catalytic hydrogenolysis of all three benzyl groups to yield the desired diol II. The cyclic pyrophosphate may be prepared from the diol by phosphorylation with phosphorous oxychloride to give the diol bismonophosphate disodium salt, followed by cyclization using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to give the desired product as the disodium salt.

The ethanol was gradually distilled out in approximately 30 minutes, then reflux slow distillation of the residual aqueous 2NHC1 solution was continued with the oil bath at about 1400. After 3 hours, the solution volume was reduced to about 2 ml. An aliquot was resolved on thin layer chromatography silica gel CHC13 aqueous 90 methanol acetic acid 60 40 0.1 and the reaction was determined to be incomplete.The reaction solution was diluted with more aqueous 2N HC1 2 ml and the solution was boiled under reflux for 2 more hours and then evaporated to dryness, first in a stream of N2 1000 then at 1000 0.5 mm.

EXAMPLE 3 9 4 Hydroxy 3 hydroxymethyl butyl guanine The addition of p toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate 83 mg to a magnetically stirred suspension of 9 4 benzyloxy 3 benzyloxymethyl butyl guanine 190 mg at 220 in methanol 5 ml gave a clear solution to which 20 Pd OH2 C catalyst 38 mg was added. The mixture was then hydrotenated at room temperature and pressure. After 60 minutes the reaction was complete by thin layer chromatography silica gel CHC13 aqueous 90 methanol 70 30 . Water 2 ml was added to the reaction mixture which was then titrated to pH 7.0 with aqueous 2N NaOH about 0.32 ml . Most of the methanol was evaporated from the mixture at 700 100 mm and the hot residual aqueous mixture was filtered through diatomaceous earth Supercel , with hot water 2 x 1 2 ml washing. The clear filtrate was evaporated at about 700 100 mm to about 1 ml and allowed to crystallize, yielding colorless, matted leaflets 70 mg , m.p.about 250 271 . Evaporation of the mother liquors at about 700 0.5 mm left a colorless, sticky solid 247 mg which was chromatographed over two 8 x 8 2000 micron GF silica plates CrC13 aqueous 90 methanol 50 50. The appropriate active area was thoroughly extracted with the same solvent yielding a colorless solid 59 mg which was recrystallized from hot water 1 ml to give colorless matted leaflets 19 mg , m.p. 268 273 . The two crops were combined and crystallized from water to give colorless matted leaflets, m.p. 271 275 . The NMR spectrum was identical to that set forth above in Example 1 for fraction 2. EXAMPLE 4 5 2 2 amino 1, 9 dihydro 6 oxo 6B purin 9 yl ethyl 2 hydroxy 2 oxo 1,3,2 dioxaphosphorinane Sodium SaltStep A Diethylallylmalonate 96.00 g, 0.480 mole was added dropwise over a period of 30 minutes, to 800 ml of a 1.OM solution of lithium aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran with vigorous magnetic stirring.The heat of reaction caused the mixture to boil under reflux. The mixture was stirred and allowed to cool to room temperature for one additional hour.Saturated aqueous NaCl 400 ml was then added dropwise, again causing the mixture to boil under reflux. A reasonably granular inorganic precipitate was formed. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature and the supernatant layer was decanted through a sintered funnel. The inorganic material was shaken with two 200 ml portions of ether and the combined organic extracts were evaporated at about 600 water bath temperature at a pressure of 120 mm to yield a pale yellow oil. For drying, this oil was dissolved in 250 ml of ether and magnesium sulfate was added. After filtration, the supernatant was evaporated yielding a pale yellow oil 59.88 g which was fractionally distilled through a 1 x 10 cmVigreux column. The fraction having a boiling point of 850 0.2 mm pressure 40.05 g , 2 allylpropane 1,3diol, was retained for use in the following step.Step B 2 Allylpropane 1,3 diol 20.00 g and sieve dried triethylamine 34.84 g were mixed. Anhydrous ether was then added to bring the volume of the solution Solution A to 100 ml. Freshly distilled PC13 23.65 g was dissolved in anhydrous ether to a solution volume of 100 ml Solution B . SolutionsA and B were added simultaneously, dropwise, at the same rate over a period of one hour to vigorously mechanically stirred anhydrous ether 400 ml at 0 under dry nitrogen in an ice bath. Each portion reacted instantly, precipitating HN Et3Cl with the mixture becoming a thick slurry. Stirring was continued at 0 for an additional 30 minutes. The mixture was then filtered and the solids were washed with two 200 ml portions of ether.The combined ethereal filtrates were evaporated at about 50 water bath temperature and 100 mm pressure. The residue was a colorless oil 31.88 g which was fractionally distilled through a 1 x 10 cm Vigreux column. The fractions boiling at 53 61 0.50 mm pressure were combined 18.72 g and redistilled in the same apparatus. The fraction boiling at 42 44 0.15 mm pressure, a 3.2 1.0 cis trans mixture of 5 allyl 2 chloro 1,3,2 dioxaphosphorinane 16.14g was retained for the next step.It has the followingNMR spectrum EMI18.1 OCHA OC EMI18.2 Cis Trans 2.45 m 1.77 m 1.92 m 2.56 m 4.00 m 3.90 m 4.25 m 4.78 m 5.14 m 5.14 m 5.72 m 5.72 m Step C 5 Allyl 2 chloro 1,3,2 dioxaphosphorinane 1.000 g was dissolved in anhydrous ether 5 ml and added dropwise over a period of 10 minutes to a magnetically stirred solution of benzyl alcohol 628 mg and sieve dried triethylamine 560 mg in anhydrous ether 20 ml at 0 under dry nitrogen in an ice bath. HNEt3Cl rapidly separated. The mixture was stirred at 220 for an additional 20 minutes and then filtered.The solids were washed with two 10 ml portions of ether and the combined ethereal solutions were evaporated at about 400, at a pressure of 100 mm, yielding a cis trans mixture of 5 allyl 2 benzyloxy l,3, 2 dioxaphosphorinane as a colorless oil 1.461 g . A few mg of this oil were retained for NMR and the rest of the sample was treated at once with ozone and sodium borohydride as described below. NMR showed that the trans cis ratio was 3.17 1. Step D Freshly prepared 5 allyl 2 benzyloxy 1,3,2 dioxaphosphorinane 1.400 g was dissolved in CH3CN 28 ml and 0.1 ml of a saturated solution of SolventRed 23 dyestuff Sudan III in acetonitrile was added. The pale pink solution was cooled in a dry ice methanol bath at 15 with magnetic stirring, and a stream of 02 03 from a Welsbach T816 generator 8 lb in 90 volts about 1 2 liter minute about 1 2 mmole 03 minute was bubbled through it, venting through a tube filled with calcium chloride.After 42 minutes, the reaction solution was only very faintly pink and the 02 03 was shut off. An excess of CH3 2S 0.82 ml was then added to the reaction solution and the 150 cooling bath was replaced with a water bath at 300 for 15 minutes.With the reaction solution at about 230, an excess of powdered sodium borohydride 0.210 g was added in portions in about 2 minutes. Rapid reaction occurred and a colorless suspension formed which was stirred at room temperature for 20 minutes. The suspension was then cooled in an ice bath and treated dropwise with a slight excess of a saturated solution of NaCl in aqueous HC1 about 5 ml . The mixture was diluted with 30 ml of chloroform, shaken, and the organic phase was decanted off from the wet opaque inorganic layer. The inorganic layer was extracted with decantation with 20 ml of chloroform and the combined chloroform solutions were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated at about 500, at a pressure of 0.5 mm, leaving a very pale yellow viscous oil 1.405 g .This oil was chromatographed over a 2.2 x 10.5 cm column of silica gel 14 g , prepared in hexane 75 ethyl acetate as follows The oil was shaken with 30 ml of hexane 75 ethyl acetate and a sticky paste formed. The supernatant was decanted onto the column. The paste was then extracted by decantation with three 10 ml portions and the column eluate collected as fraction 1 which was evaporated at about 600 at a pressure of 0.5 mm.This procedure was repeated with three 10 ml portions of various solvents as indicated below in Table I.After fraction 5, very little insoluble material was left. w LE I Frac Material After tion Volume Solvent Evaporation 1 60 hexane 75 ethyl acetate trace gum 14 mg 2 30 hexane 75 ethyl acetate colorless oil 233 mg 3 30 hexane 75 ethyl acetate colorless oil 131 mg 4 30 ethyl acetate colorless oil 15 mg 5 30 ethyl acetate 10 methanol colorless oil 8 mg 6 30 ethyl acetate l0 methanol colorless oil 516 mg 7 30 ethyl acetate 10 methanol colorless oil 167 mg 8 30 ethyl acetate 108 methanol colorless oil 7 mg Fractions 2 and 3 were determined to be identical by thin layer chromatography on silica gel using hexane 75 ethyl acetate as the solvent.Similarly, fractions 6 and 7 were determined to be identical. NMR indicated that fractions 6 and 7 were the desired 2 benzyloxy 5 2 hydroxyethyl 1,3,2dioxaphosphorinane as a 2.6 1 trans cis mixture and that fractions 2 and 3 were 5 allyl 2 benzyloxy 2 oxo 1,3,2 dioxaphosphorinane as a 3 1 trans cis mixture. The latter compound is the result of incomplete ozonization where only pIII has been oxidized to pV. Step E Recrystallized para toluenesulfonylchloride 479 mg was added to a solution of 2 benzyloxy 5 2 hydroxyethyl 2 oxo 1,3,2 dioxaphosphorinane 570 mg in sieve dried pyridine 1.5 ml at 0 ice bath and the solution was magnetically stirred under dried nitrogen for three hours. The solution became a pale yellow slurry. Thin layer chromatography on silica gel with ethyl acetate as the solvent indicated that the reaction was incomplete. Accordingly, additional para toluenesulfonylchloride 40 mg was added to the reaction mixture, which was then allowed to warm up to 220 over a period of 30 minutes, becoming a clear yellow solution. Once again, thin layer chromatography indicated that the reaction was incomplete.After an additional 50 minutes at 220, the solution was shaken with a mixture af 5 ml of ethyl acetate and 0.5 ml of water for 1 minute. An additional 25 ml of ethyl acetate was then added. The solution was then extracted in sequence with two 5 ml portions of water, two 5 ml portions of aqueous lN hydrochloric acid, 5 ml of aqueous 5 sodium bicarbonate and 5 ml of water. The solution was then dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and then evaporated at 600 at a pressure of 0.5 mm, yielding a colorless gum 503 mg . NMR, using CDC13, indicated that the material appeared to be a cis trans mixture of the desired product. On standing at room temperature overnight, the crude product partially crystallized. Triturating the crude product with petroleum ether or diethyl ether gave gummy products.With 0.5 ml of ethanol, however, a finely divided solid was formed. The solid was filtered off, washed with two 0.2 ml portions of ethanol, and dried at 220 at a pressure of 0.5 mm to obtain 2 benzyloxy 5 2 p toluene sulfonyloxyethyl 1,3, 2 dioxaphosphorinane as a colorless waxy solid 160 mg , m.p. 118 1210.

A. Bowles et al., J. Med. Chem., 6, 471 1963 , was dissolved in sieve dried dimethylformamide 1 ml at 230 forming a cloudy solution.This solution was treated with a 57 sodium hydride oil dispersion 24 mg . After several minutes of vigorous magnetic stirring, the oily clumps of the reagent slowly broke up with effervescence, forming a cloudy solution. 2 Benzyloxy 5 2 p toluenesulfonyloxyethyl 2 oxo 1,3,2 dioxaphosphorinane 200 mg was added to the reaction solution at 230 dissolving rapidly with magnetic stirring under dry nitrogen.After three hours, a sample of the solution was tested by thin layer chromatography on silica gel with ethyl acetate 10 methanol as the solvent. The reaction was found to be incomplete and was therefore allowed to continue overnight. The reaction solution was then diluted with 25 ml of ethyl acetate, washed with four 5 ml portions of water, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated at 600 under 0.1 mm pressure, leaving a colorless glass 254 mg . This material was subjected to preparative thin layer chromatography on 2000 micron silica gel plates, using chloroform aqueous 90 methanol, 80 20, as the solvent, followed by further preparative thin layer chromatography on 500 micron plates using the same solvent.Extraction of the band having Rf 0.47 with chloroform aqueous 90 methanol, 80 20, filtration, and evaporation at about 600, under 0.5 mm pressure, yielded the 7 isomer 5 2 2 amino 6 benzyloxy 7H purin 7 yl ethyl 2 benzyloxy 2 oxo 1,3,2 dioxaphpsphorinane 46 mg NMR CDCl3 1.45 m, lH, 2.08 dt, 2H,J 7.5 and 7.5 Hz, CH2 H 3.92 m, 2H, J 20, P , 11.5 gem , clEz, P O CH eq. 4.15 m, 2H,J 11.5 gem , 4 P , ClEz, POCRax 4.20 t, 2H,J 7.5 Hz, N CH2 5.08 d, 2H, J 8Hz, P O CH2Ar 5.26 s, 2H, NH2 5.47 s 2H, OCH2Ar 7.34 7.43 m, 10H, Ar 7.77 s, lH, C8 R .

Extraction of the band having Rf 0.60 with chloroform aqueous 90 methanol, 90 10, filtration, and evaporation at about 600, under 0.5 mm pressure, yielded the 9 isomer 5 2 2 amino 6benzyloxy 9H purin 9 yl ethyl 2 benzyloxy 2 oxo 1,3,2 dioxaphosphorinane 72 mg as a colorless foam. Crystallization from ethanol gave colorless prisms, m.p. 1621660.

Ultimate confirmation of structure was provided by single crystal X ray crystallographic analysis, which showed the dioxaphosphorinane ring to be in the chair form, with the large 2,5 substituents trans and diaxial, and the attachment to the purine system to be at position 9. fiteP G 5 2 2 amino benyoxypurin 9 y ethyl 2 benzyloxy 2 oxo l,3,2 dioxaphosphorinane 70 mg was dissolved in methanol 5 ml and 20 Pd OH 2 C catalyst 20 mg was added. The mixture was hydrogenated with vigorous magnetic stirring at ambient temperature and pressure for 2 hours. The cloudy mixture was then filtered through Fisher diatomaceous earth Celite filter aid with additional washing with three 1 ml portions of methanol. The catalyst and filter bed were then extracted with three 3 ml portions of water at 900, spinning the solids down and decanting the hot supernatant through a fresh filter aid bed. The combined filtrates were evaporated at about 600 and 0.5 mm pressure, leaving a colorless crystalline solid 37 mg .This material was very sparingly soluble in D20 but gave a good NMR spectrum for the desired product, 5 2 2 amino 1,9 dihydro 6 oxo 6Hpurin 9 yl ethyl 2 hydroxy 2 oxo 1,3,2 dioxaphosphorinane, plus some minor extraneous peaks at S 5.8 and 7.5 NMR D20 I 2.01 m, lR, T 2.02 t, 2H, J 6Hz, CH2 4.11 ddd, 2H, J 12, 12 and 5Hz,P O CHA 4.30 t, 2H, J 6Hz, N CR2 4.36 ddd, 2H, J 12, 12 and about 2Hz, P O CHB 8.69 broad s, 1H, C8 H .
