## Description
TITLE INTEGRATED PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF TEXTURED MULTIFILAMENT YARN BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to plastic article shaping processes. More particularly it relates to the forming of continuous or indefinite length material with crimping or crinkling of strands or filaments.Prior Art BackgroundTextured multifilament yarn was initially produced according to a procedure comprising three separate stages, viz., spinning, drawtwisting or draw winding, and texturing. In the interest of increased efficiency and economy, as well as improved product quality, semiintegrated processes such as spin draw winding and draw texturing were later developed. In today s market where speed, efficiency, economy, and product quality must all be significantly enhanced in order to maintain a competitive position a fully integrated spin drawtexturing process is virtually a requirement for most producers. The present invention is an improved spindraw texturing process. Statement of Closest Known Prior ArtThe closest prior art of which the inventors are aware is set forth below.1. U.S. 3,975,484, Okada, et al., relates to a process comprising melt spinning non circular cross section polyamide filaments, which are allowed to cool, treated with a substantially non aqueous oil, passed around a feed roll having a peripheral speed of more than about 200 meters per minute, passed in contact with a heated body through a contact angle between about 800 and about 1600 with the surface temperature of the heated body maintained in the range of about 1700 2500C and with the radius of surface curvature in the range of about 15 75 mm.The filaments are thereby subjected to one sided heating and drawing, passed around a heated draw roll having a peripheral speed of more than about 800 meters per minute and a surface temperature of less than about 2200C, whereupon they are passed through a steam jet crimper which is supplied with steam at a temperature in the range of about 2000 3500C. This detailed spin draw texturing process differs from the improvement which is the present invention in a number of significant aspects, the most notable being that the reference does not comprehend pre tensioning the lubricated melt spun filaments beyond the elastic limit thereof at a temperature between about 200 and 600C prior to the drawing thereof, and pre heating the pretensioned filamentary polymeric material to a temperature between about 30 and 1000C prior to the drawing thereof.2. U.S. 4,096,226, Martin, et al., relates to an integrated process for the continuous spinning, drawing, and texturing of polyamide filaments, in which the following steps are effected in immediate succession a melt spinning filaments of polyamide polymers at temperatures between 2600 and 2950C at a spin draw ratio of between 2 10 and 1 60 b drawing the spun filaments on at least 2 forwarding elements, the initial element having a surface temperature between 500 and 1200C and the final element having a surface temperature between 800 and 3500C, at a draw ratio such that the drawn filament, on leaving the drawing stage, has an extensibility of between 10 and 50 percent and c texturing the drawn filaments at a velocity of between 800 and 3,000 meters per minute by an air jet process wherein the overfeed in the texturing stage is from 10 to 50 percent, and the filament temperature, prior to texturing, is between 500 and 1800C.Not comprehended in this reference is the requirement in the present invention that the following cooperative combination of steps must be employed a Lubricating the filamentary polymeric material from the melt spinning step by applying thereto a lubricating composition comprising 1 a lubricant and 2 a solvent in an amount of from 0 to 90 per cent by weight of the lubricating composition b Pre tensioning the lubricated melt spun filamentary polymeric material beyond its elastic limit at a temperature between about 20 and 600C prior to the drawing thereof followed by c Pre heating the pre tensioned filamentary polymeric material to a temperature between about 30 and 1000C prior to the drawing thereof.3. U.S. 3,939,639, Ellegast, relates to a continuous process for the production of textured multifilament yarns from synthetic thermoplastic high molecular weight polymers by spin draw texturing, wherein the unstretched multifilament yarn is directed from the spinning phase to the draw texturing phase through tubes made of metal, plastics, glass, or ceramics.Nowhere taught or suggested in this reference is the requirement in the present invention that the following cooperative combination of steps must be employed Pre tensioning the lubricated melt spun filamentary polymeric material beyond its elastic limit at a temperature between about 20 and 600C prior to the drawing thereof followed byPre heating the pre tensioned filamentary polymeric material to a temperature between about 30 and 1000C prior to the drawing thereof.4. U.S. 3,854,177, Breen, et al., relates to a process and apparatus for texturing continuous multifilament yarn at high speeds to increase the bulk thereof. A stream of hot compressible fluid is jetted to form a turbulent region, into which the filamentary yarn is passed. The filamentary yarn is removed from the fluid stream by means of a foraminous surface, whereupon it is cooled with fluid on the foraminous surface to set the crimp prior to the imposing of any substantial tension thereon. In FIG. 3 in Col. 3, lines 64 68 and in Col. 4, line 66 to Col. 5, line 11, reference is briefly made to an integrated spin draw texturing process.However, nowhere is it taught or suggested that the following cooperative combination of procedural steps which is the improvement of the present invention, should be followed a Lubricating the filamentary polymeric material from the melt spinning step by applying thereto a lubricating composition comprising 1 a lubricant and 2 solvent in an amount of from 0 to 90 per cent by weight of the lubricating composition b Pre tensioning the lubricated melt spun filamentary polymeric material beyond its elastic limit at a temperature between about 20 and 600C prior to the drawing thereof followed by c Pre heating the pre tensioned filamentary polymeric material to a temperature between about 30 and 1000C prior to the drawing thereof. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe primary object of the present invention is to provide an improvement in the prior art process for the production of textured multifilament yarn from a fiberforming, thermoplastic, linear, high molecular weight polymer by the combination in immediate succession of the procedural steps of melt spinning, drawing, texturing and packaging.The improvement which is the present invention comprises the cooperative combination of the following three procedural steps with those of melt spinning, drawing, texturing and packaging a Lubricating the filamentary polymeric material from the melt spinning step by applying thereto a lubricating composition comprising 1 a lubricant and 2 solvent in an amount of from 0 to 90 per cent by weight of the lubricating composition b pre tensioning the lubricated melt spun filamentary polymeric material beyond its elastic limit at a temperature between about 20 and 600C prior to the drawing thereof followed by c Pre heating the pre tensioned filamentary polymeric material to a temperature between about 30 and 1000C prior to the drawing thereof.All three procedural steps of the instant improvement are essential. When the improvement is employed, the result is a quality yarn, which is characterized by an insignificant number of broken filaments, and excellent physical properties, such as tenacity, elongation, dyeability, and crimp contraction. Moreover, a very low variance in these yarn characteristics is obtained. As a consequence, the yarn produced by the process of the present invention is eminently suitable for use in the fabrication of carpets, employing standard procedures well known in the art. When one or more of the three procedural steps of the instant improvement are not employed, a quality yarn is not produced, as evidenced by a significant number of broken filaments, and less than excellent physical properties, such as tenacity, elongation, dyeability, and crimp contraction.Moreover, a wide variance in these yarn characteristics is obtained. Consequently, the yarn so produced which is characteristic of the prior art processes, is not always suitable for use in the fabrication of carpets, employing standard procedures well known in the art. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGFor a more complete understanding of the present in vention, including its primary object and benefits, reference should be made to the Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments, which is set forth below.This detailed description should be read together with the accompanying drawing, which schematically depicts certain preferred embodiments according to the improved process which is the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTSReferring now to the drawing, a number of particularly preferred embodiments according to the present invention are shown. Supply tank 1 contains the fiberforming, thermoplastic, linear, high molecular weight polymer to be spun, preferably in chip form. This polymer is preferably a polyamide, and most advantageously polycaprolactam. The polymer from supply tank 1 is melted in a standard melt extruder 2, whereupon the molten polymer is directed into a metering pump, preferably two metering pumps 3, as shown in the drawing, which pumps are readily available commercially.Metering pumps 3 cause two polymer streams to pass individually into separate standard spinnerette packs 4, whence each individual polymer stream is spun through a spinnerette having the desired number of holes of a chosen shape to form molten filamentary polymeric strands 5. Before entering the spinnerette holes, each polymer stream has been filtered, as is generally employed and well understood by those of skill in the art. The particular temperature for the polymer in spinnerette packs 4 depends upon the actual molecular weight of the polymer, as is well known by those of skill in the art.Molten filamentary polymeric strands 5 are quenched by means of standard quench cabinet 17, which provides a flow of transversely moving cooling gas, especially air, as shown by the arrows. The two groups of solidified filamentary polymeric strands are then individually configured in separate close packed, essentially monofilamentary layers, to each of which a lubricating composition is applied by means of finish applicators 6. The lubricating composition applied comprises a lubricant, and solvent especially water in an amount of from 0 to 90 percent by weight of the lubricating composition. The finish applicators are any of a number of those known by the skilled artisan, e. g., those described in U.S. Patent No. 3,893,412.Guides 7 are employed to separately direct the individual lubricated multifilament groups around a standard, commerciallyavailable pre tensioning godet and separator roll 8.In one embodiment of the invention, the multifilament groups 20, which have been straightened at ambient temperatures below the elastic limit thereof, are passed around storage rolls 19, which afford a means for providing a residence time of between about 1 and 5 seconds for the straightened filamentary polymeric material.Storage rolls 19, which are large, unheated, standard godets traveling at a low rate of speed, provide that residence time which is sufficient to allow moisture migration to occur within the filamentary polymeric material, in order to ensure that subsequent drawing thereof can be accomplished without breakage of the filaments. Such a residence time is necessary when the lubricating composition contains solvent especially water in an amount of from about 50 to 90 percent by weight of the lubricating composition. Such a residence time is not necessary when the lubricating composition contains only the lubricant, or lubricant and solvent especially water in an amount of less than about 50 percent by weight of the lubricating composition.Under the latter conditions, the multifilament groups 18 from the pre tensioning godet and separator roll 8 bypass the storage rolls 19, and having been pre tensioned beyond the elastic limits thereof at ambient temperatures, they are pre heated and then drawn, for example, between a first set of standard heated drawrolls 9 and a second set of standard heated drawrolls 10 as shown in the drawing.The two individual multifilament groups, or threadlines, are then directed to separate texturing units 11, in order to produce a bulky multifilament yarn, which is discharged in crimped form onto commercially,available cooling belts 12. The texturing units are preferably fluid jet texturing units well known to those of skill in the art and exemplified by those described in U.S.Patents 3,714,686, 3,908,248 and 3,950,831. The textured yarn, which at this point has a degree of entanglement, is removed from cooling belts 12 by means of standard takeaway godet 14 and guides 13, and is, in one embodiment, directed immediately to fluid interlacing jets 15, which provide further entanglement of the individual filaments as desired. If no further entanglement is necessary or desired, the textured yarn is caused to bypass interlacing jets 15, passing directly to standard, commercially,available take up winders 16, by means of which the yarn is wound into packages for subsequent use or sale. The fluid interlacing jets employed are any of a number of those well known to the skilled artisan, such as those described in U.S. Patents 3,115,691 and 3,125,793. All of the procedural steps specified hereinabove are accomplished in immediate succession, thereby affording an integrated process, wherein all steps combine co operatively to give the desired result.As outlined above, filamentary polymeric material from the melt spinning step is first cooled and then lubricated by applying thereto a lubricating composition comprising a a lubricant and b solvent in an amount of from 0 to 90 percent by weight of the lubricating composition. This lubricated, melt spun filamentary polymeric material is then pre tensioned beyond its elastic limit at a temperature between about 20 and 600C, after which it is pre heated to a temperature between about 30 and 1000C before being drawn.Especially advantageous results are obtained when the solvent employed in the lubricating composition is water in an amount sufficient to provide up to about 50 percent by weight of the lubricating composition. The same advantageous results are obtained if no solvent is present, viz., if the lubricant is applied in neat form.Under these conditions, the pre heating of the pretensioned filamentary polymeric material is beneficially accomplished at a temperature between about 35 and 700C prior to the drawing step. Moreover, these conditions are especially desirable when the fiber forming, thermoplastic, linear, high molecular weight polymer is a polyamide, particularly polycaprolactam.When polycaprolactam is employed, the very best results are achieved if the lubricant is a member selected from the group consisting of polyalkoxylated alcohols, thiols, acids, and phenols, and water is present in the lubricating composition in an amount of 0.1 to 50 percent by weight of the lubricating composition. Moreover, it is desirable to apply the lubricating composition uniformly over the width and along the length of the filamentary polymeric material so that a level of from 0.2 to 3 percent by weight of lubricant, based on the weight of the polymer, is achieved. Such uniform application is achieved by means of devices such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 3,893,412. The polyalkoxylated alcohols and thiols are of the type described in U.S. Patent No. 4,111,818 the polyalkoxylated acids are of the type described in U.S.PatentNo. 4,110,227 and the polyalkoxylated phenols are of the type described in U.S. Patent No. 2,674,619.Equally beneficial results are achieved if water is present in the lubricating composition in an amount of 0.1 to 10 percent by weight of the lubricating composition, and the lubricant is a member of the group consisting of polyalkoxylated alcohols as specified above , polyalkoxylated thiols as specified above , polyalkoxylated acids as specified above , polyalkoxylated phenols as specified above , vegetable triglycerides such as coconut oil , polyalkoxylated adducts of natural and synthetic esters of glycerol such as glycerol monolaurate ethoxylated with 23 moles of ethylene oxide by standard techniques wellknown to those of skill in the art , and phosphate antistatic agents such as those available under the designation G 2200 from ICI Americas, Inc. .When the lubricating composition which is applied to the solidified filaments from the melt spinning step contains solvent, especially water, in an amount of from 50 to 90 percent by weight of the lubricating composition, the lubricated filamentary polymeric material is first straightened below the elastic limit thereof, as described hereinabove, after which a residence time is provided for the straightened filamentary polymeric material prior to pre tensioning thereof at essentially ambient temperatures beyond the elastic limits thereof followed by pre heating of the pre tensioned filamentary polymeric material to a temperature between about 60 and 100 C. Whereas a residence time of 0.5 seconds or less has been shown to be unsatisfactory, a residence time of from 1 5 seconds has been shown to be sufficient to afford moisture migration within the filamentary polymeric material, whereby subsequent drawing thereof can be accomplished without breakage of the individual filaments. These conditions are especially applicable when the fiberforming, linear, high molecular weight polymer is polycaprolactam. As described hereinabove with particular reference to the drawing, this residence time is conveniently provided by means of storage rolls 19, which are standard, unheated godets traveling at a low speed.When the fiber forming, thermoplastic, linear, highmolecular weight polymer employed is polycaprolactam, the melt spinning through the spinnerette holes in spinnerette pack 4 referred to above is advantageously carried out at a temperature between about 240 and 2900C, whereby individual melt spun filaments are produced having a modification ratio of from 1 to 4, as understood by those of skill in the art, at a polymer throughput of 0.2 to 0.4 grams minute x textured dtex x number of threadlines employed . The filaments are advantageously quenched by means of air at a temperature between about 5 and 250C and a relative humidity between about 20 and 90 percent. The residence time of polymer in spin duct is beneficially between about 0.1 to 1 seconds.When polycaprolactam is employed as the fiber forming, thermoplastic, linear, high molecular weight polymer, the pre tensioning subsequent to application of the lubricating composition is beneficially carried out at essentially ambient conditions by stretching the poly caprolactam filaments between about 1 and 5 percent of the length thereof, and, most preferably between about 1 and 2 percent of the length thereof. These conditions appertain when solvent, especially water was present in the applied lubricating composition in an amount of 0 to 50 percent, or in an amount of 50 to 90 percent.Moreover, when the fiber forming, thermoplastic, linear, high molecular weight polymer employed is polycaprolactam, the filamentary polymeric material which has been pre tensioned as described in detail immediately above is advantageously drawn by first ensuring that the filamentary polymeric material is at a temperature between about 35 and 700C, and most preferably between about 40 and 600C, wherupon the filamentary polymeric material is stretched in a single zone at a draw ratio of from about 1.5 to 4, and most preferably between about 2.5 to 4, followed by heating the stretched filamentary polymeric material to a temperature between about 120 and 2000C and most preferably between about 140 and 1800C. Under such conditions it is especially beneficial if the elapsed time between the conclusion of the lubrication step and the conclusion of the drawing step is between about 0.1 and 2 seconds.However, if the pre tensioned filamentary polymeric material was lubricated with a lubricating composition which comprised solvent, especially water in an amount of from 50 to 90 percent by weight of the lubricating composition, drawing is most advantageously accomplished by first ensuring that the pre tensioned filamentary polymeric material is brought to a temperature between about 60 and 1000C, and most preferably between about 80 and 100 C, whereupon the filamentary polymeric material is stretched in a single zone at a draw ratio of from about 1.5 to 4, and most preferably between about 2.5 to 3.5. Thereupon the stretched filamentary polymeric material is heated to a temperature between about 120 and 2000C, and most preferably between about 140 and 1800C.Under such conditions it is especially beneficial if the elapsed time between the conclusion of the lubrication step and the conclusion of the drawing step is between about 1 and 7 seconds.At the conclusion of the drawing step, texturing of the drawn filamentary polymeric material is conveniently and advantageously accomplished by fluid jet means. For this purpose, devices such as those described in U.S.Patents 3,714,686 and 3,908,248 have been found to be especially advantageous. When polycaprolactam is the fiber forming, thermoplastic, linear, high molecularweight polymer, fluid temperatures between about 200 and 4500C are utilized at a flow rate of 15 normal cubic meters per hour or less. Under such conditions, both texturing and interlacing of the filamentary polymeric material are effected simultaneously. The textured and interlaced filamentary polymeric material is immediately cooled by means of a fluid to a temperature of less than about 500C without any stress on the filaments, while they are kept in an essentially tensionless state on cooling belts or the like, as outlined hereinabove. Thereupon the cooled textured and interlaced filamentary polymeric material is wound into a package by standard means, for subsequent utilization or sale.Convenience and efficacy are the results when the texturing and cooling fluids are air, and when the texturing process is accomplished with a plurality of threadlines, each entering the fluid texturing device at a linear velocity greater than 200 meters per minute, and wherein the individual threadlines have a weight to length ratio of between about 500 and 3000 dtex.If texturing devices other than those referred to above are employed, or if texturing conditions are utilized which result in little, or effectively no interlacing, or if an enhanced degree of interlacing is required or desired for any purpose, a separate interlacing step may be employed following the conclusion of the texturing operation. Such interlacing is effectively accomplished by the utilization of any of a number of fluid jet interlacing means known to those of skill in the art, such as those devices described in U.S. Patents 3,115,691 and 3,125,793, among many others.In this embodiment the textured filamentary polymeric material is passed through the fluid jet means after cooling of the textured filamentary polymeric material to a temperature of less than about 500C has been effected without stress on the individual filaments, which are kept in an essentially tensionless state on cooling belts or the like, as outlined hereinabove.Resulting from especially preferred embodiments of the process of the present invention as described above is a textured multifilament yarn having the following characteristics Tenacity grams dtex 2.1 2.9 Elongation percent 35 60 Boiled shrinkage percent 2 6 Crimp contraction employing hot air at 1500C percent 10 18 Bulk boiled percent 7 15 Broken filaments km 0 0.5The following examples, which are not limiting but illustrative only, provide a more complete understanding of the present invention, including its primary benefits and advantages over the prior art.EXAMPLE 1 This invention This example illustrates the use of pre tensioning and low pre heat prior to drawing when an essentially nonaqueous finish is used. Nylon 6 chips having a relative viscosity of 2.69 as measured in 96 98 sulfuric acid and containing less than 0.01 titanium dioxide were melted in an extruder and spun at a temperature of 2700C through two spinnerettes with 68 irregular shaped holes each at a thruput of 230 grams per minute per spinnerette 0. 161 grams per minute X textured dtex X number of threadlines 0.161 X 1430 dtex X 2 4607 forming two 68 filament threadlines. The spun filaments were quenched with a cross flow of air at approximately 120C, were lubricated with a non aqueous spin finish of the polyalkoxylated acid group and were wrapped around an ambient pre tensioning godet that established a spinning speed of 645 meters per minute. The threadlines were pre tensioned, at levels ranging from 0.039 pond dtex to 0.238 pond dtex representing a stretch of 0.5 to 2.0 respectively, by establishing a differential speed between the pre tensioning godet and a first heated godet pair.The pre tensioned threadlines were heated on the first godet pair at levels of 35, 45, and 550C, and were immediately drawn in a single zone to a speed of 2000 meters per minute by wrapping the threadlines around a second heated godet pair. The quality of the drawn threads was evaluated by monitoring the number of broken filaments generated at each of the pretension and first godet temperature levels followed by physical property analysis.The following table clearly shows the advantages of pre tensioning and low temperature pre heating Pre Tension Level Pre Heat Broken Fila Fiber Tenacity FiberG Dtex Stretch Tempera ments per G Dtex Elongation Based on Spun, ture Minute per at Break Undrawn Dtex 0C Threadline 0.039 0.5 35 15.0 3.12 35.2 0.238 2.0 35 0.8 3.28 36.7 0.039 0.5 45 1.6 3.19 36.5 0.238 2.0 45 0.1 3.42 37.3 0.039 0.5 55 2.7 3.22 38.3 0.238 2.0 55 0.0 3.38 38.3NOTE Less than 0.3 broken filaments per minute per threadline is considered acceptable.EXAMPLE 2 Not This Invention For Comparative Purposes The example illustrates the unsatisfactory fiber properties obtained when high water content finish, no pretension, and normal pre heat conditions are used.Nylon 6 chips having a relative viscosity of 2.69 as measured in 96 98 sulfuric acid and containing 0.3 titanium dioxide were melted in an extruder and spun at a temperature of 2510C through a spinnerette with 136 irregular shaped holes at a thruput of 415 grams per minute forming a 136 filament threadline. The spun filaments were quenched with a crossflow of air at approximately 100C, were lubricated with a 16.5 oil in water emulsion with an oil in the triglyceride group, and were wrapped around a first heated godet pair rotating at a speed of 500 meters per minute. Runnable drawing performance could not be achieved until the first godet pair was at a temperature above 120 C, which is in the normal range for the discontinuous process. Drawing was accomplished at temperatures of 120 to 1500C at a draw ratio of 3.5X. The following table illustrates that at best only poor drawing performance was achieved and the fiber physical properties of tenacity and elongation are characteristic of a marginally acceptable pre textured fiber.Pre Heat Broken Fihents Fiber Tenacity Fiber Elongation atTemperature per Minute G Dtex Break OC 120 26.0 3.09 52.0 130 2.0 3.27 58.5 140 1.4 2.64 49.3 150 1.8 2.45 46.2EXAMPLE 3 This Invention This example illustrates the effects of water in finish and how excellent tenacity and elongation with low broken filaments are obtained.Nylon 6 chips having a relative viscosity of 2.69 as measured in 96 98 sulfuric acid and containing less than 0.01 titanium dioxide were melted in an extruder and spun at a temperature of 2700C through two spinnerettes with 68 irregular shaped holes each at a thruput of 235 grams per minute per spinnerette forming two 68 filament threadlines. The spun filaments were quenched with a crossflow of air at approximately 120C, and were lubricated with an oil spin finish of the alkoxylated alcohol group than contained varying levels of water from essentially 0 to 30 . The fiber was stretch pretensioned 2 , pre heated to 600C, and stretched 3.35X to a speed of 2000 meters per minute.The fiber finished with 30 water exhibited good tenacity and elongation, 4.2 g dtex and 34.5 , but unacceptable broken filament performance 0.9 filament breaks per minute. The fiber finished without water exhibited good tenacity and elongation as well as a good low break frequency 4.1 g dtex at 34.5 elongation and 0.2 filament breaks per minute.EXAMPLE 4 This Invention This example describes one possible operational condition of the process and its high productivity level.Nylon 6 chips having a relative viscosity of 2.69 as measured in 96 98 sulfuric acid and containing less than 0.01 titanium dioxide were melted in an extruder and spun at a temperature of 2650C through two spinnerettes with 99 irregular shaped holes each at a thruput of 335 grams per minute per spinnerette forming two 99 filament threadlines. The spun filaments were quenched with a crossflow of air at approximately 120C, and were lubricated with an oil spin finish of the polyalkoxylated alcohol group that contained essentially no water. The fiber was stretch pre tensioned 1 1 2 , pre heated to 450C, and stretched 3.25 X to a speed of 2119 meters per minute and heated to 1650C. The stretched threadlines were crimped in a hot air texturizer such as that in U. S.Patent 3,908,248 and deposited onto a rotating cooling sieve through which air was moved by means of a vacuum. The sieve moved at a velocity of 45 meters per minute. The threadlines were unraveled from their plug form on the cooling sieve to a speed of 1732 meters per minute established by a cold pair of godets. The yarns were subsequently interlaced in a conventional air jet and wound up under 200 pond tension on a double cup winder.Some of the fiber produced was processed in a commercial space dyeing operation and exhibited excellent uniformity and bulk cover. Other fiber was commercially cabled, continuously heatset, tufted, and dyed into an excellent residential type carpet. The fiber exhibited physical properties common to BulkedContinuous Filament BCF products including Dtex 1990 Tenacity 2.3 g dtex Elongation at Break 40 Tank Bulk in Hot Water 10.2 Dyeability Piece dyeable in Acid Red absence of noticeable streaks in Ortalon Blue G Tank Bulk was determined by measuring the length change in a skein of fiber exposed to boiling water under two loads of approximately 0.0003 g dtex L2 and 0.09 g dtex L1 , respectively. Bulk was calculated by the following equation Bulk EMI20.1 X 100Although the present invention has been described in detail with respect to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it is understood by those of skill in the art that modifications and variations in this detail may be effected without any departure from the spirit and scope of the present invention, as defined in the hereto appended claims.
