# Percutaneous absorption type adhesive pharmaceutical preparation.

## Abstract
A percutaneous absorption type preparation comprises a backing readily conformable to skin or mucosa and substan tially impermeable to a drug absorbed through the skin or mucosa, and bearing a layer of an adhesive which comprises a polymer which is pressure adhesive at room temperature and which contains the drug present as a saturated solution in the polymer and excess drug is dispersed in the polymer in the form of recrystallized fine particles. The polymer and drug are both dissolved in a solvent to prepare a solution which is coated on the backing, to make the preparation. The excess portion of drug is re dissolved in the polymer when the drug is consumed by absorption through the skin or mucosa. The drug is released continuously over a long period of time.
