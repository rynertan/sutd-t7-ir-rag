# OIL DELIVERY SYSTEM

## Abstract
An oil delivery system for supplying heavy oil from a source that is contaminated with water to burners 34,336 . Control apparatus 8, 14 heats the heavy oil solution until it is preheated above the saturation temperature of water at the pressure in a de watering tank 18 which is connected to the control apparatus and receives the prehe ated heavy oil solution. The tank 18 is maintained at a pressure sufficient to permit any liquid water contained in the heavy oil solution to vaporize and thus be removed from the heavy oil. A low pressure pump 26,28 delivers the de watered heavy oil from the tank 18 to a combustion apparatus such as a marine power generator or oil burner 34,36 .
