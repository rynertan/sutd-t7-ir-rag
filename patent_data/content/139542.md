# ROD MATERIAL FOR FISHING RODS

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a fishing rod 10 formed from one or more lengths of rod material 11 each length of which has a polygonal cross section such as a hexagon or penta gon. Each length is formed from a number of triangular section elements having a base part 21 of a fibre reinforced plastics and an apex part 20 of a rigid plastics foam. The triangular section elements are bonded together with the base parts forming the outer wall of the section and the apex parts forming an inner core to resist collapse of the section when it is heavily bowed.
