# Time base error correction for optical disc players.

## Abstract
An optical apparatus is described for use with a video disc 7 having frequency modulated video information 9 recorded thereon in the form of a plurality of concentric circles or a single spiral. The information track comprises successively positioned light reflective and light non reflective regions 10, 11 . A focused light beam 4 is caused to be positioned over the centre of an information track and the light reflected from the information track is gathered by an objective lens 17 for application to electronic circuitry 30 for recovering the recorded frequency modulated video signals. Radial tracking means are described for maintaining the focused light spot to impinge upon the centre of an information track. Lens focusing means are described for positioning the objective lens at the optimum focused position above the information track for gathering the maximum amount of reflected light from the information track. FM processing means are described for reconstructing the recovered frequency modulated video information such that the ratio between the amplitude of the signals as recorded is essentially the same in the signals as recovered from the video disc member. Further servo means are described for handling the selective change of the intersection of the reading beam with the video disc member in a predetermined preferred mode of operation.
