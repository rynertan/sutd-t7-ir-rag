# Method for manufacturing a circuit board with a through hole.

## Abstract
A method for manufacturing a circuit board with through hole, by taking the processing steps of forming a preferred wire distribution pattern by selectively etching the two side copper clad laminate piercing holes to be used as the through holes at the specified locations masking the surface of the board except the through hole portion by using the conductive layer and the pH resistant layer ink forming the conductive film over the through hole by the electroless plating forming the metal foil with appropriate thickness over the conductive film by the electroplating, by using the conductive layer as the electrode at one end and finally, removing the conductive layer and the pH resistant layer.
