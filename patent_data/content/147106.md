# ELECTRICAL POWER TRACK SYSTEM

## Abstract
An electrical power track system 10 employing an elongate track member 12 having had a plurality of longitudinal slots 36, 44 opening outwardly of laterally opposite surfaces 30, 32 of the track member 12 and providing access to a plurality of offset longitudinal electrical conductors or bus bars 38, 40 and 46 , and a gripper member 14 adapted to be mounted in straddle fashion on the track member 12 and carrying electrical contacts 84, 86 which are manipulated in response to mounting of the gripper member 14 on the track member 12 so as to selectively engage the electrical conductors 38, 40 and 46 and facilitate connection of an electric load to an electrical circuit carried by the track member 12 . The longitudinal slots 36, 44 are L or T shaped in transvere cross section and prevent straight in access to the associated longitudinal conductors 38, 40 and 46 carried by the track member 12 .
