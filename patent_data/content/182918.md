# NUMERICALLY CONTROLLED APPARATUS HAVING PROGRAMMABLE MIRROR IMAGE FUNCTION.

## Abstract
A numerically controlled apparatus in which a mirror image function is processed on a machining program. When a mirror image code and positions S2, S4, S7 of coordinate axes at which mirrors are placed are set to the machining program that is read out, data FX I, FY 1 representing that a mirror image instruction is being issued and mirror positions XM, YM of the coordinate axes are stored S5, S6, S8, S9 with respect to only those coordinate axes on which the mirrors are placed. Depending upon the data and mirror positions, movement instruction values Xi, Yi set to the program are converted S12, S15 into movement instruction values 2XM Xi, 2YM Yi by the mirror image, and are produced S16 . The matching is carried out by the function of the mirror image which is based upon the thus converted outputs.
