# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR USE IN DE PACKAGING PACKAGED GOODS

## Abstract
Apparatus for a process of recovering e.g. cigarettes from faulty packets includes a rotary sorter II having a hopper 13 for depositing the packets on a turntable 12 having a stationary spiral guide wall associated therewith, friction between moving packets and the wall 26 orienting the packets for onward feeding in a direction lengthwise of the packets to a first slitter 33 . The first slitter makes shallow cuts down each long, shallow side of a packet which is then conveyed, without turning, to a second slitter 45 , the latter functioning to cut the packet in two. The cigarettes and the packaging fragments are thereafter separated in a rotary, inclined screening drum having slats spaced apart sufficient ly to pass cigarettes only, the packaging fragments being retained in the drum.
