The carrier or excipient may take various forms depending upon the desired formulation. Thus, for example, one or more compounds of general formula I as hereinbefore defined may, for example, be dissolved in a physiological solution of sodium chloride, or a solution of glucose, lactose and or mannitol in order to formulate a pharmaceutical composition suitable for injection. Alternatively, it is possible to freeze dry the compounds or compound of the present invention, to which sodium chloride is added to prepare a powderly injection agent according to the Pharmacopoeia of Japan. The composition may, if desired, comprise conventional additives or excipients such as for example pharmaceutically acceptable salts which are well known in the pharmaceutical art. The dosage units may contain any appropriate amount of active ingredient, for example, an amount of 0.02 to 1 mg kg day, although the daily dose may vary with differring conditions.The administration may be effected, for example, by intravenous injection and may be administered, for example, from 1 to 3 times per week. The present invention thus includes compositions of the present invention in sterile form. If desired, oral administration may be possible.Dosage unit forms suitable for oral administration may, for example, include tablets, powders, granules and ampoules and may further contain appropriate excipients well known in the pharmaceutical art. If desired, the composition may be administered, for example, into the artery, abdominal cavity or thorax. Formulations of the compounds of the present invention are illustrated in the following non limitingExamples.Example A 7 N, 7 .

The resultant sterilized filtrate 1.0 ml is poured into brown vials 10 mg vial and frozen at 500C for 2 hours. After confirming that the temperature of the ingredient in the vial reaches the atmospheric temperature, the material is further dried in vacuo 0.1 mm Hg at an atmospheric temperature of 200C for 4 hours, and the vial is sealed with a rubber plug In use, a sterilized physiological sodium chloride solution 5 ml containing a dissolution aid is added to the ingredient and well stirred to obtain an injecting solution.Example B 7 N 2 hydroxyethyldithioethyl mitomycin C 3 g prepared by the method of Example 9 is dissolved in distilled water 1000 ml and treated in a smilar manner to that described in Example A with the exception that the second drying is effected at an atmospheric temperature of 300C. Example C 7 N 2 aminoethyldithioethyl mitomycin D 10 mg , prepared by the method of Example 3, lactose 90 mg , corn starch 40 mg , polyvinyl alcohol 4 mg , Avicel 28 mg microcrystalline cellulose, commercially available fromFMC Corpn., U.S.A. and magnesium stearate 1 mg are used to prepare a tablet in conventional manner. The following experiment illustrates the antitumour activities, acute toxicities LD50 and toxicities against bone marrow of certain compounds of the present invention Experiment 1 Effect on Sarcoma 180 solid tumour 5 x 106 cells of Sarcoma 180 solid tumour were innoculated into the abdominal cavities of groups of ddy mice, each group consisting of 5 mice. 7.days after this, on each occasion, the tumour cells were collected from the ascites of the mouse. The cells were washed with a sterilized physiological sodium chloride solution and used to 7 prepare a cell suspension containing 5 x 10 cells per ml of a sterilized physiological solution of sodium chloride, of which 0.1 ml was injected under the skin of the right armpit of a ddy male mouse body weight 20 2 g .A test compound was dissolved in a physiological solution of sodium chloride or a similar solution containing Tween 80 a surfactant commercially available from Atlas Chemical Industries, Inc., U.S.A. . 24 hours after the implantation of the tumour cells, the test compound 0.1 to 0.2 ml was injected into the test mice intraperitoneally. In order to determine the antitumour activity of the test compound, 7 days after the implantation of the tumour cells, on each occasion, the major axis a and minor axis b of the tumour were measured to calculate the volume of the tumour a x b 2 . The anti tumour effect was evaluated by the ratio of the tumour volume in the test animals T to the corresponding volume of the control untreated animals C . 2 Determination of ED50 A dose capable of reducing the volume of a Sarcoma 180 solid tumour to 50 of the corresponding volume of the untreated group on average was defined as the ED50. T C ratios and the doses were respectively plotted on the ordinate in arithmetic scale and abscissa in logarithmic scale on graph paper, from which the relationship between the doses and the T C ratios was calculated as a straight line by the least square method. From the straight tropic line thus obtained, the dose corresponding to a T C of 0.5 was determined. 3 Acute toxicity LD50 On each occasion, the test compound was given to the test animal. After this, the death ratio of the animals of the test group was observed for 14 days, from which LD50 was calculated by Behrens KÃ¶rber s method. 4 Chemotherapeutic Index C.I. The ratio of LD50 to ED50 was defined as C.I.A greater C.I. suggests a greater effective range of the drug. 5 Effect upon the number of peripheral leukocytes 5 x 106 cells of Sarcoma 180 solid tumour were implanted under the skin of each mouse at the right armpit.24 hours after this, venous blood 0.02 ml was collected from the eyepit of the mouse and suspended in Cell Kit Seven solution 10 ml commercially available from Toa Iryo DenshiR.K., Japan . To the suspension, a drop of saponin solution was added to dissolve the red cells and the number of leukocytes were counted using a microcell counter. The number of leukocytes and the corresponding dose were respectively plotted on the ordinate in arithmetic scale and on the abscissa in logarithmic scale on graph paper to investigate the relationship between dosage and the number of peripherical leukocytes. A dose capable of giving 4000 leukocytes mm was defined as WBC 4000, which corresponded to about 1 2 the number of peripherical leukocytes in normal mice. 6 WBC 4000 ED50 The greater the ratio of WBC 4000 to ED50 the smaller the decrease in the number of peripherical leukocytes viz. the lower the toxicity against bone marrow in the area of the effective dose. The results obtained from the experiments are shown in the following Table 2. Table 2 A ... Anti tumour activity B ...
