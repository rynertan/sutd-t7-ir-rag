## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING CATALYTIC SYSTEMCOMPONENTS FOR THE HIGH YIELD POLYMERIZATION OF ALPHAOLEFINES, PRODUCTS OBTAINED THEREBY AND POLYMERIZATION PROCESS EXPLOITING THEM This invention relates to a process for the preparation of catalytic systems useful for the high yield polymerization of alpha olefines, particularly of propylene it relates in addition to the products so obtained. It is known that the catalysts for the preparation of polypropylene must contain in their composition a magnesium halide generally MgC12 and electro donors, which act as supports for the catalytically active element, which is titanium and is present as TiC14, and that such catalytic materials are used as components inZiegler type systems in which the aluminium alkyl is, in its turn, associated with a fraction of the electrodonor. Both the yield and the stereospecificity of the polypropylene produced with such particular catalytic systems are greatly influenced by the correct setting of the ratios MgC12 Ti chloride electron donor in the solid catalytic component and aluminium alkyl electrondonor in the soluble Ziegler component. However, the method of preparation of the support for the solid catalytic component is by far the outstand ing factor in determining the characteristics of the catalytic system, both under the respect of the activity and the stereospecificity in the polymerization of alphaolefines. Among the methods for the preparation of the solid catalytic material the concurrent dry grinding of the individual components is a process which is generally adopted, as disclosed in the German DE OS Specifications 21 43 346 and 21 43 348. More recently, the literature refers to solid catalytic components obtained by synthesizing MgC12, generated in situ, or by halogenation of organic metallic species of the soluble magnesium, or also by Grignard disproportionation Brit. Pat. 867 401,German DE OS 29 04 103 . Catalytic materials of the kind referred to above are generally characterized by specific surface areas which are higher than those obtained by mechanical concurrent grinding and consequently they, in combinations of the Ziegler type, generally display an improved catalytic efficiency in the polymerization of alpha olefines. The present Applicants have now found, and this is the subject matter of the present application, a process for the preparation of the solid component of catalytic systems usable for the high yield polymerization of alphaolefines, more particularly of propylene. The catalytic component so prepared, which is, in turn, another aspect of the present invention, is capable, in point of fact, of producing polypropylene with outstandingly high yields which are higher than those described in the conventional art, under conditions of even very moderate pressures, which can even be as low as 5 atm. A basic feature of the solid components made according to this invention is that they contain, in addition to magnesium chloride, titanium chloride and the electron donor,also All3, the latter being present in a ratio close to the stoichiometric ratio relative to titanium and must possess such a surrounding environment that the possibility of the formation of complexes between it and the electron donor can definitely be excluded. This compound is employed, as outlined above, as a component of a catalytic system in the polymerization of alpha olefines, more particularly of propylene, and the system in question comprises, in addition to the solid component defined hereinabove, an organic metallic compound of aluminium and a variable proportion of an electron donor. The ratio of the Al of the co catalyst to the Ti of the solid catalytic body must be higher than 10 and is preferably comprised between 50 and 100, whereas the proportion of the electron donor relative to the cocatalyst must be such that the molar ratio ED. A1 is lower than 1, ED standing for Electron Donor, and is preferably comprised between 0.01 and 0.5. The Electron Donor s associated to the co catalyst can be same as, or different from, that which takes part to the composition of the solid catalytic component. Such an Electron Donor, preferably one of the non chelating type, can be selected from among ethers, aldehydes, alcohols, phenols, esters, also of a heterocyclic or aromatic nature, amines, nitriles, amides, thioalcohols, tioethers, tioesters or derivatives of phosphorus, such as phosphoramides, phosphites, phosphates, or phosphines. The composition of the solid catalytic component comprises, as specified hereinabove, MgCl2, an electron donor, A1C13 and titanium chloride. The ratio of the magnesium chloride to the titanium chloride is higher than 10 and is preferably comprised between 15 and 30. The Electron Donor, which is preferably an ester and above all an alkyl ester of the bezoic acid or a derivative of the latter acid, is introduced in the catalytic composition so as to exclude the formation of complexes of it with A1C13 and, in addition, it must be present in such an amount that the ratio Electron Donor MgC12 is below 0.5 and is preferably comprised between 0.1 and 0.25.As outlined above, the solid catalytic component must contain AlCl3 so that the ratio AlCl3 Ti chloride is equal to 1 or nearly 1, and the preferred value for this ratio is preferably comprised between 0.8 and 1.5 For the preparation of the solid catalytic component the instant process provides for a synthesis in two sequential steps the first is the preparation of an insoluble metallic organic component which is compo sed by Al, Mq, an electron donor , a halogen and a certain amount of Mg alkyl or Al alkyl groups and which will be called herein the solid metallic organic component A .The second step provides for the formation in proper sense of the solid catalytic component which will be called B herein, as obtained by treating A with an excess of TiC14 and a polyhalogenated hydrocarbon and or an inorganic halide also used in excess, at a temperature generally comprised between 200C and 1500C and preferably between 600C and 1100C. The adoption of the polyhalogenated hydrocarbon and of the inorganic halide is vital to the end of achieving the formation of the compositions indicated for the solid catalytic component B and thus for the display of the maximum activity in polymerization, expressed in term of kg of polymer per g of Ti. These activities, in fact, are at least 5 times a multiple of those which are obtained from catalytic materials which are prepared by omitting the treatment with the polyhalogenated organic or inorganic component. For the preparation of the insoluble metallic organic component A two alternative approaches have been followed. The first procedure comprises the reaction, in a hydrocarbonaceous solvent, between magnesium dialkyl and a metallic organic compound of aluminium, preferably AlEt2Cl,. partially complexed with an electron donor, an ester of the type indicated above whenever possible, and, preferably, an alkyl benzoate or a derivative thereof. The ratio Al Mg must be 2 or slightly above 2 and the ratio Al electron donor must be 2 or higher and a ratio comprised between 3 and 5 is preferred. The second procedure contemplates the use of magnesium atoms as produced by vaporization of metallic magnesium in hydrocarbonaceous solution containing a metallic organic compound of aluminium, preferably AlEt2Cl partially complexed with an electron donor of the same kind as indicated hereinabove and an alkyl chloride, so that the ratio Al electron donor is preferably within the range which has been indicated and the ratio Al RCl Mg is at least 2 or slightly thereabove. Both procedures lead, as outlined above, to a product which contains Mg, Al, chlorine, electron donor s and alkyl metal groups Mg alkyls, Al alkyls this product precipitates from the hydrocarbonaceous solutions and can be collected on a filter and purified by washing it with inert eluants to strip it from the excess of aluminium alkyl and electron donor. As a rule, it is not required that this insoluble metallic organic compound is dried so that it is reslurried in a hydrocarbon petroleum is preferred and kept ready in storage for the subsequent treatment with TiC14 and the polyhalogenated hydrocarbon. The insoluble metallic organic component A exhibits a composition which is different from that of the solid catalytic component proper B more particularly it exhibits a lower Mg Al ratio and a higher Mg Ti ratio these ratios, however, are adjusted in the subsequent treatment with TiC14 and the polyhalogenated hydrocarbon or the inorganic halide and brought to the ranges of the compositions indicated above for the solid catalytic component. The treatment with the excess TiC14 and with the excess of the polyhalogenated hydrocarbon or the inorganic halide is carried out by reslurrying A0 in such pure reagents or in a solution thereof in a hydrocarbonaceous solvent. Among the polyhalogenated hydrocarbons to be used to this purpose, there can be mentioned CC14, CHC13, C2C16, CBrC13, hexachlorocyclopentadiene, hexachloropropylene and others, and, among the inorganic ones, there can be mentioned SnC14, SnC13R, SbCl5, SiC14, POC13 and others CC14 or its derivatives are preferred. A necessary condition is that TiC14 and the organic or the inorganic chlorinated compound are used in a broad excess over the weight of the insoluble metallic organic component B preferably from 10 to 1000 parts by weight. The ratio of the polyhalogenated hydrocarbon and or the inorganic halide to TiC14 can be varied within a wide range, for example from 0.1 to 10, and preferably is confined between 0.5 and 2. The treatment is carried out under hot conditions for a variable time reaction times from half hour to 3 hours and temperatures from 650C to 1100C are advisable. On completion of the treatment, the solid catalytic component B is filtered when still hot, washed with a hydrocarbonaceous liquid and dried in a stream of nitrogen free of oxygen, or under vacuum. The polymerization of polypropylene or other alpha olefines with the catalyst according to the present invention is carried out in conditions which are normally used for the Ziegler type systems, in suspension, or in the gaseous phase or in a monomer in the liquid state at a temperature comprised between ambient temperature and 2000C and under pressures which may attain 150 atm. The as produced polymer has been tested without removing the heterotactic fraction the intrinsic visco sity has been measured in Dl g decilitres per gram units in decaline at 1350C, and the percentage crystal linit has been measured with X ray irradiation on samples which had been annealed at 1300C for three hours. A few examples will now be supplied, having the purpose of illustrating the invention without, however, limiting it.EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of the solid catalytic component B by the method which employs Mg nor. C6H13 2. A solution in nor. heptane 80 mls of AlEt2Cl 20 mls, i.e. 160 millimols was cooled between OOC and 50C and supplemented dropwise during 15 20 minutes, with stirring, with a solution in nor.heptane 20 mls of ethylbenzoate 6 mls, i.e. 40 millimols . The solu tion was reconditioned at room temperature 200C for 30 mins. and was maintained at such a temperature for 30 additional minutes with stirring. The solution was allowed to cool again at OOC 20C and supplemented dropwise with a 17 solution of Mg nor.hexyl 2 in hexane 80 mls., 70 millimols with vigorous stirring during 20 mins. A precipitate was formed, which was stirred for 20 additional minutes at OOC, and two hours at room temperature thereafter. The product was withdrawn from the solution by filtration on a sintered glass filter, washed with nor.heptane 5 times with 3 millimols each and fluidizing it each time in nitrogen counterflow on the filter. The product thus obtained, which was the solid catalytic component A was reslurried without drying it in nor.heptane 70 mls and the slurry was phoned in a solution of TiC14 50 mls in CC14 30 mls which was vigorously stirred at room temperature.
