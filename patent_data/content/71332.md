# Seal and scraper assemblies.

## Abstract
A seal and scraper assembly 10 for a nut and screw actuator has an elastomeric member 16 bonded to a metal ring 18 . The elastomeric member has an annular lip outer portion 20 and a helical thread form inner portion 22 . The inner portion has a plurality of scraper surfaces 24 which interrupt the thread form at an oblique angle and co operate with respective lubricant return surfaces 26 to direct lubricant scraped from the screw thread 14 surface into the housing 12 enclosing the screw actuator. A web portion 30 extends between the outer lip and the inner thread form along the same angle as each scraper surface so that a component of the assembly forces on the outer lip portion is transmitted to the scraper surface so as to increase the thread sealing and scraping forces. The metal ring has a contoured inner surface 36 which is effective to chip ice and other foreign matter from the screw thread outboard of the elastomeric member, and a pair of radially extending lugs 32 which co operate with recesses formed in the nut to prevent relative rotation between the nut and the seal and scraper assembly.
