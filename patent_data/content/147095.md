# Improvements in pipe laying and replacement.

## Abstract
Apparatus for use in the laying and or replacement of pipes underground comprises a sleeve 1 having a front end and a rear end, a percussive drive means in the form of a pneumatically operated impact mole 2 mounted in the sleeve 1 and arranged to drive the front end of said sleeve through the ground, means for securing the leading end of a pipe 10 to the rear end of the sleeve and means for pushing the pipe through a bore formed in the ground as the sleeve is advanced through the ground by the mole 2 . The means for securing the end of the pipe to the sleeve includes an annular spigot 8 which allows relative axial movement to take place between the pipe 10 and the sleeve 1 in order to prevent impact stresses on the sleeve 1 from the mole 2 from being transmitted to the pipe 10 . The pipe pushing means desirably comprise hydraulic rams arranged to bear on a plate located at the rear end of the pipe and a yoke 19 which is connected to the mole 2 by chains 28, 33 .
