# MARKING DEVICE FOR PIPE

## Abstract
A marking device comprises a movable arm having a working end carrying a marking tool, such as a marking head. A controller is associated with the movable arm and so programmed as to axially move the marking tool to a desired axial position opposing the inner or outer surface of the pipe and to circumferentially move the marking tool along the surface while applying a preset mark to the corresponding surface of the pipe.
