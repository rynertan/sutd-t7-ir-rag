# An improved feed forward circuit.

## Abstract
A feed forward circuit 10 includes a first circuit loop 12 to isolate signal noise and distortion and a second circuit loop 14 to reduce signal noise and distorsion. The first circuit loop 12 and the second circuit loop 14 have directional coupler means 18, 24, 34, 42, 52, 62 , amplification means 40, 60 and delay means 32, 50 . The first circuit loop 12 and the second circuit loop 14 are interconnected through a pair of common directional coupler means 34, 42 having common balance circuitry 48 connected therebetween. The first circuit loop 12 has a signal input terminal 16 and an input test terminal 30 and the second circuit loop 14 has a signal output terminal 58 and an output test terminal 68 . The improvement in the feed forward circuit includes a pair of additional directional coupler means 24, 62 . One of the additional directional coupler means 24 connects the first circuit loop 12 with the input test terminal 30 and the other additional directional coupler means 24, 62 are operable to promote an accurate alignment and balance of the feed forward circuit and improve gain flatness and reduce signal distortion during operation thereof. A method is also provided for aligning and balancing such a feed circuit. The presence of the additional directional coupler means 24, 62 in the improved feed forward circuit substantially reduces the magnitude of any undesirable signal present during alignment and balancing to promote an accurate alignment and balancing of the feed forward circuit.
