# Raster scan display device and method.

## Abstract
An A.C. Plasma Display Panel is operated in a video mode using the same signal train as applied to a convention al cathode ray tube terminal. For character generation, a selective erase technique is employed in which all cells in a raster line are energised and then selectively erased in accordance with the video data to be displayed. To facilitate the erase operation, a line of cells in close proximity to the scan line being selectively erased is employed to provide adequate and uniform priming for the erase operation, and is synchronised to maintain its position with respect to the line being erased. A short plasma erase signal is utilised to fit within the scan rate of the display. The invention is also applicable to character generation in block or multi line mode.
