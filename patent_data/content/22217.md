## Description
Background of the Invention The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display device capable of presenting various kinds of displays by using a plurality of stacked liquid crystal cells, especially TN type liquid crystal cells. A display device which is capable of presenting various kinds of displays by using a plurality of stacked TN type liquid crystal cells is already known. The orientation of the molecules of a liquid crystal cell of this type is characterized in that the liquid crystal molecules between the electrodes are twisted through 90 degrees as shown inFigs. 1 A and 1 B . In order to form a liquid crystal display device using a plurality of TN type liquid crystal cells, the TN type liquid crystal cells a shown as three in number are stacked, and polarizing plates b and c are arranged at both outer sides as shown in Fig. 2. After a light ray d, incident from the lower side of the figure, is polarized by the polarizing plate b, it undergoes rotatory polarization when passing through the liquid crystal.The rotation is 90 degrees when the ray is incident on the second liquid crystal cell from the first liquid crystal cell. When proceeding from the second liquid crystal cell to the third liquid crystal cell, the light ray undergoes another rotatory polarization through 90 degrees, and the transmitted light ray is consequently optically rotated with respect to the incident light ray. Thus, the optical rotation may be varied according to the number of TN type liquid crystal cells in the display device. The two polarizing plates b and c are so arranged that their polarizing directions cross. In the TN type liquid crystal cell, liquid crystal molecules g sealed between upper and lower glass bases e and f are gradually twisted so that the major axes of the uppermost and the lowermost liquid crystal molecules are twisted through 90 degrees.In the vicinity of the glass base surface, the major axes of the liquid crystal molecules are parallel to the orienting direction of the glass base. In a known liquid crystal display device of the arrangement and combination shown in Fig. 2, the orientation of the uppermost liquid crystal molecule of one liquid crystal cell and the orientation of the lowermost liquid crystal molecule in the immediately adjacent liquid crystal cell cross each other, resulting in an error in double refraction. The light ray is thus divided into light rays of different wavelengths. This results in the generation of ring shaped interference fringes, making it difficult to visually recognize the intended display Summary of the Invention The primary object of the present invention, therefore, is to provide Ã  liquid crystal display device using a plurality of stacked liquid crystal cells wherein no interference fringes are generated at the side of the display plane. To the above and other ends, the present invention provides a liquid crystal display device capable of presenting various kinds of displays by using a plurality of stacked TN type liquid crystal cells wherein the liquid crystal molecules are rendered optically continuous by aligning the direction of orientation of the liquid crystal molecules at contiguous planes of adjacent liquid crystal cells, thereby eliminating the generation of interference fringes through the continuity of the liquid crystal molecules. The above and other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description made with reference to the accompanying drawings. Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 A is a vector representation from above illustrating the basic molecular orientation of TN type liquid crystal cells. Fig. 1 B is a vector representation from the side of the basic molecular orientation shown in Fig. 1 A . Fig. 2 is a sectional side view illustrating a conventional display device which uses TN type liquid crystal cells. Fig. 3 is a sectional side view of a liquid crystal display device according to the present invention. Fig. 4 A and 4 B are both fragmentary views illustrating the relation of the orienting direction of a glass base and the liquid crystal molecular orientation of a TN type liquid crystal cell. Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment An embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the attached drawings. Fig. 3 shows a liquid crystal device in accordance with the present invention wherein three TN type liquid crystal cells are stacked on top of each other. They are so combined that the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules in adjacent liquid crystal cells is continuous. At the boundary between a first liquid crystal cell 1 and a second liquid crystal cell 2, a lowermost liquid crystal molecule 2a of the second liquid crystal cell 2 and an uppermost liquid crystal molecule la of the first liquid crystal cell 1 are aligned so that their major axes are parallel to each other.In a similar manner, a lowermost liquid crystal molecule 3a of a third liquid crystal cell 3 and an uppermost liquid crystal molecule 2a of the second liquid crystal cell 2 are aligned so that their major axes are parallel to each other. In this case, the orienting direction of a glass base lb above the liquid crystal cell 1 and the orienting direction of a glass base 2b below the liquid crystal cell 2 are opposite to each other. The glass bases align the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules. However, although the orienting direction of a glass base and the major axes of the nearby liquid crystal molecules are made parallel to each other at the interface Of the glass base and the liquid crystal, the liquid crystal molecules cannot be kept precisely parallel, but are slightly separated from the orienting direction of the glass base.Due to this, when the orienting directions of the glass bases are made to be in the same direction when combining two liquid crystal cells, the liquid crystal molecules to be made parallel to each other as shown inFig. 4 B are consequently not parallel. In order to make them parallel, the orienting directions of the glass bases must be made opposite Fig. 4 A as described above. For this reason, the orienting directions of the glass bases are made opposite between the liquid crystal cells 2 and 3.This means that the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules of the adjacent liquid crystal cells are in vector alignment. Numerals 4 and 5 in the figure denote polarizing plates. In summary, in accordance with the present invention, in a liquid crystal display device capable of presenting various kinds of displays by using a plurality of stacked TN type liquid crystal cells, the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is made continuous in all of the liquid crystal cells, so that no errors in double refraction are generated, and the generation of inteference fringes is prevented. It is to be understood that the present invention is not only applicable to a display device using TN type liquid crystal cells alone, but also to a display device which suitably combines TN type liquid crystal cells and CII type liquid crystal cells uniaxially oriented type liquid crystal cells .
