# SLICE LIP ADJUSTMENT

## Abstract
A device for use in conjunction with a slice lip 13 ad justing mechanism for controlling the distribution of stock across the web of a paper machine to obtain a desired cross machine profile of basis weight, moisture, caliper and the like. The slice lip 13 abuts a slice body 12 but is at least slightly movable relative thereto. An apertured adjusting arm 17 engages the slice lip 13 for fine adjustment of the lip position. Disengagement between the adjusting arm 17 and the slice lip 13 is prevented by a headed bolt 33 in combination with a plug 41 and a compressed spring 38 which acts between the plug 41 and the adjusting arm 17 . A tube 39 is provided for receiving the plug 41 at one end, with the opposite end of the tube 39 being spaced from the adjusting arm 17 by a small predetermined clearance b thereby limiting the extent to which the adjusting arm 17 can move away from engagement with the slice lip 13 . Locking means 48 are provided to lock the tube 39 in an adjustable position relative to the plug 41 .
