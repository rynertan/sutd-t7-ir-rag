# MAGNETOELECTRICAL TRANSDUCER

## Abstract
A magnetoelectrical transducer comprising a three terminal magnetic field intensity sensing structure 7 formed by a pair of magneto resistors M₁, M₂ . The magnetic field intensity sensing structure 7 is disposed opposite to a magnetic body 3 arranged for movement relative thereto in a magnetic field and generates a first electrical signal V
