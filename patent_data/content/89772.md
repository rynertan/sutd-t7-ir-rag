# Pervious tunnel liner member.

## Abstract
Prefabricated liner plate 10 for lining the interior of a suberranean tunnel as a primary lining. The liner plate is formed in such a manner that the outer arcuate face 14 has a depression 12 formed therein so that a filter 16 placed in said depression permits water flow therethrough, but pre vents the passage of surrounding soil particles therethrough. Suitable conduit means allows any water which may pass through the filter to be bled through the liner plate and led out of the tunnel.

## Description
PERVIOUS TUNNEL LINER MEMBER BACKGROUND OF UHE INVENTION The construction of large underground tunnels is usually accomplished by removal of material at the tunnel face by machine or otherwise and subsequently lining the exposed tunnel surface with prefabricated liner members as the tunnel progresses through the ground Usually, the tunnelling process will be assisted or in some instances made possible by the use of compressed air in the tunnel during the construction of the tunnel, as is usual in a plenum tunnelling process. The above process has been in use since late in the nineteenth century and has been used successfully to drive tunnels through wide varieties of soil. If the soil through which the tunnel is being driven is impervious, the tunnel driving process is quite straightforward, and a minimum of air pressure will be required to allow the tunnel process to progress, If, however, the tunnel must be driven through areas where pockets or strata of pervious material are present in the plenum area, problems with the ingress of sand and water into the plenum area act to impede the tunnelling process. Pervious materials can cause problems for either of two reasons. In cases where the pervious material allows the air to flow directly to the atmosphere the pressure in the tunnel continuously escapes because the air leaks out, hitherto the only remedy has been to increase the air supply to the tunnel until the supply balances the leakage at the desired pressure. In cases where the pervious materials are totally enclosed by impervious materials, the pervious formation can fill up with air so that the air acts on the water within for formation and allows it to flow into the tunnel, no good solution has been found for this second problem in shield driven tunnels. Tunnellers have had to rely on various methods of face breasting with planks, straw, and other materials to restrain the flow. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention seeks to ameliorate and in some instances eliminate the problem of ingress of water and silt from the pervious strata during the driving of subterranean tunnels, and to control the air pressure and air consumption which have been characteristic of these tunnels. Basically the invention accomplishes its end by the use of a liner which is pervious to water and air but impervious to soil and sand. This is accomplished by providing a liner member for the tunnel which is provided with a recess in the face thereof, which is exposed to soil for the passage of moisture therethrough. The recess will be provided with a foraminous substance in the form of a soil filter to allow the passage of water and air therethrough, but of a small enough size to prevent soil particles from passing therethrough. In order to allow easy passage from the filter medium to the opposite side of the liner member, a plurality of channels are provided in the recess beneath the filter medium which are connected to the through passage s which allow the water to pass through the tunnel liner member. The through passages are connected to a suction line, that is, a system of conduits, the interior of which is at atmospheric pressure. Thus, the water which passes through each of the liner members of the type described above will actually be carried out of the tunnel by the plenum air pressure. The effect of this drainage will be to lower the pore pressures in the soil in contact with the specially fitted liners. This drainage and lowered pressure will improve the behavior of the soil by 1. preventing pressurizing of pervious strata by tunnel air. 2. providing localized water table depression and hence lower air pressure requirements. 3. reducing the pore pressure differential across high working faces.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a perspective view of a liner plate which is the subject of this invention. Figure 2 is a sectional view of the liner plate of Figure 1. Figure 3 shows an alternative embodiment of the invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Throughout this description reference will be made to a tunnel liner plate. Although the word plate will be used, it is understood that the plate may be a prefabricated steel plate or a cast iron plate or a formed concrete block. All the above have been successfully used as primary tunnel lining members. It will be seen when reference is made to the accompanying Figures 1 and 2 that a tunnel liner plate 10 is shown to which this invention is applied. This is a metallic plate of the usual arcuate shape to conform to the surface of the tunnel face. Suitable bolt holes are provided in the tunnel liner member for ready assemblage of the individual liner members into a complete tunnel lining. Arcuate plate 10 is provided with a recess 12 as shown in Figure 2 so that the central portion of the surface facing the soil is somewhat recessed. In the plate shown, the recess is of a rectangular shape and in this instance the recess covers a majority of the area exposed to the tunnel face. A foraminous filter 14 is of a nature which permits the flow of water there through, but will not allow the passage of soil particles therethrough, is placed in the recess above a grillwork 16. Grillwork 16 is provided to ensure that any water which passes through filter 14 will be provided with easy passage to the outlet conduit 18. Outlet 18 is connected to the mop or suction line in the tunnel plenum to allow any water passed through filter 14 to escape. In practice, the use of the liner plates of this invention are used interchangably with standard liner plates of the usual impervious nature. The plates of this invention may be interspersed as required with conventional liner plates or they may be used exclusively in the tunnel construction if the conditions warrant. The plates of this invention may take a variety of forms as far as the filter portion of the liner is concerned. The exposed filter surface may be made to be of almost any size as long as the structural strength of the liner plate is not impaired. The filter medium may be of the treated cellulose fibers type which are widely available in a variety of pore sizes. The filter medium is preferably glued to the liner plate at the periphery thereof for ease of handling and simplicity of installation. A grille 16 of any suitable material, i.e. plastic or wireform metal which is of a nature to provide easy passage of water passing through the filter to the exit conduit 18. Alternatively, suitable passages may be provided in the exterior surface of the liner plate by providing depressions in the liner surface for water flow from the peripheral areas to the interior of the liner plate where the exit conduit is located. It may be found in some instances that more than one exit conduit may be provided. In the alternate embodiment shown in Figure 3, the liner plate 30 is provided with a recess 32 in which the foraminous filter medium 34 is glued and the recessed portion of the liner plate 34 is provided with a plurality of through holes such as the one shown at 36. A shield 38 of a plastic or other suitable material is sealedly fitted to the inside surface of the liner plate. Conduit 40 is again connected to the mop or suction line. Various alternatives are possible, and those skilled in the art will readily understand that whilst the pervious liner rates of this invention have been described for use in association with tunnels, there is no reason why such pervious Dlates may not be just as successfully utilized in the sinking of caissons where the excavation tends to move in a vertical direction instead of the generally horizontal direction in constructing tunnels.
