## Description
The present invention relates to a modified fibrinolytic enzyme in particular modified tissue type plasminogen activator, its preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing it and its use in the treatment of thrombotic disease. The sequence of amino acids making up the enzyme tissue type plasminogen activator t PA and the nucleotide sequence for the cDNA which codes for t PA are known see Pennica et al, 1983 Nature, It has been shown Bányai, L. The applicants have now identified modified forms of the t PA enzyme which retain fibrinolytic activity. According to the present invention there is provided a fibrinolytically active tissue type plasminogen activator which has been modified in the region of the growth factor domain. Suitable modifications may include removal or deletion of certain amino acid residues, or replacement of one or more amino acid residues with different amino acid residues. In a preferred aspect, the modification comprises the deletion of all or part of the growth factor domain. In another preferred aspect, the t PA is modified in the region from amino acid residues 51 to 87 inclusive, in particular by deletion of that region. As used herein, the term tissue type plasminogen activator denotes a plasminogen activator of the group having the immunological properties defined for t PA at the XXVIII Meeting of the International Committee on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Bergamo, Italy, 27 July 1982. The amino acid sequence of various forms of t PA are known. The abovementioned Nature 1983 reference discloses the sequence for the L chain and the mature S chain forms of t PA, also discussed by Vehar The modified t PA of the invention may be derivatised to provide pharmaceutically useful conjugates analogous to known t PA containing conjugates, for example The modified t PA of the invention may take the place of t PA as the enzyme or human protein component, as appropriate, of any of the conjugates described above. The modified t PA of the invention or conjugate thereof can be further derivatised such that any catalytic site essential for fibrinolytic activity is optionally blocked by a removable blocking group. The above mentioned derivatives of the modified t PA may be used in any of the methods and compositions described hereinafter for the modified t PA itself. As used herein the expression removable blocking group includes groups which are removable by hydrolysis at a rate such that the pseudo first order rate constant for hydrolysis is in the range of 10 ⁶ sec ¹ to 10 ² sec ¹ in isotonic aqueous media at pH 7.4 at 37 C. Such blocking groups are described in European Patent No.0009879 and include acyl groups such as optionally substituted benzoyl or optionally substituted acryloyl. Suitable optional substituents for benzoyl blocking groups include halogen, C Suitable optional substituents for acryloyl blocking groups include C In a further aspect, the invention provides a process for preparing modified tissue type plasminogen activator according to the invention which process comprises expressing DNA encoding said modified tissue type plasminogen activator in a recombinant host cell and recovering the modified tissue type plasminogen activator product. The modification of the t PA can therefore be carried out by conventional genetic engineering techniques in which the cDNA which codes for t PA is modified and the modified cDNA expressed in a prokaryote or eukaryote host. The DNA polymer comprising a nucleotide sequence that encodes the modified t PA also forms part of the invention. The process of the invention may be performed by conventional recombinant techniques such as described in Maniatis In particular, the process may comprise the steps of The invention also provides a process for preparing the DNA polymer by the condensation of appropriate mono , di or oligomeric nucleotide units. The preparation may be carried out chemically, enzymatically, or by a combination of the two methods, The above described mutagenesis processes involve the use of oligodeoxyribonucleotides which can be designed according to the changes in the cDNA sequence coding for amino acids 44 to 91 inclusive required. The oligodeoxyribonucleotides which may be used in such processes also form part of the invention. The invention also provides a process for preparing an oligodeoxyribonucleotide of the invention, which process comprises the deprotection of a second oligodeoxyribonucleotide having the same sequence of bases as said oligodeoxyribonucleotide and in which all free hydroxy and amino groups are protected. The oligodeoxyribonucleotides used in the process can be prepared by conventional phosphotriester, phosphite or phosphoramidite chemistry, using solid phase techniques such as those described in Chemical and Enzymatic Synthesis of Gene Fragments A Laboratory Manual, ed. H.G. Gassen and A. Lang , Verlag Chemie, Weinheim 1982 ,or in other scientific publications, for example M.J. Gait, H.W.D. Matthes, M. Singh, B.S. Sproat, and R.C. Titmas, Nucleic Acids Research, 1982, Solid supports which may be employed include conventional supports known in the art, for example kieselguhr polydimethylacrylamide, silica, controlled pore glass, or cellulose paper discs. The base at the 3 end of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide to be prepared is attached, via a spacer group connected to the 3 oxygen of the terminal 2 deoxyribose unit, to the solid support and assembly of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide in a protected form is carried out in the 3 5 direction by cycles of synthesis, the required operations being performed either manually or by an automated instrument. At the end of the synthesis, the protected oligodeoxyribonucleotide may be cleaved from the solid support either before, after, or at the same time as other deprotection steps that are carried out once the desired sequence of bases has been assembled, as described hereinbelow. Conveniently the oligodeoxyribonucleotide is removed from the solid support by treatment with a basic reagent such as aqueous ammonia at ambient or slightly elevated temperature, or with 1,1,3,3 tetramethyl guanidinium Alternatively, the preparation may be carried out conventionally by phosphotriester chemistry in solution as described, for example, by C.B. Reese, Tetrahedron, 1978, The required sequence of nucleotide bases in the oligo deoxyribonucleotide may be built up conventionally, for example as described in the aforementioned publications, by the condensation of appropriate mono , di or oligomeric nucleotide units in the presence of a suitable condensing agent such as 1 mesitylene sulphonyl 3 nitro 1,2,4 triazole in a solvent such as pyridine at ambient or slightly elevated temperature when phosphotriester chemistry is employed or by a condensing agent such as tetrazole in acetonitrile at ambient temperature when phosphite or phosphoramidite chemistry is used . Optionally a capping step is introduced after each condensation step to inactivate any unreacted starting material containing a free 5 hydroxy group. Such a capping step may suitably be carried out by an acylating agent such as acetic anhydride in 2,6 lutidine and 4 When phosphite or phosphoramidite chemistry is employed, the phosphorus III atom in the phosphite triester internucleotide linkage created in each condensation step is oxidised, giving the corresponding phosphotriester linkage, before a further condensation step is carried out. Such oxidations may be carried out using a convenient oxidising agent, for example iodine in aqueous tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a base such as lutidine. The oxidation step is conveniently carried out after the optional capping step as hereinbefore described. During the synthesis of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide, the hydroxy groups in each of the internucleotide phosphodiester bridges may be protected by an aryl group or alkyl group conventionally employed for the purpose, for example 2 or 4 chlorophenyl, methyl, or 2 cyanoethyl, to prevent branching of the molecule. The aryl protecting groups are removed at the end of the synthesis by treatment with an agent conventionally employed for the purpose, for example 1,1,3,3 tetra methyl guanidinium The amino groups present in the A, C and G bases are protected by base labile protecting groups, such as benzoyl for A and C, and isobutyryl for G. Such groups may be removed by treatment with basic reagents, for example ammonia at ambient or slightly elevated temperature, for example 50 C. The 5 hydroxy group of the terminal ribose moiety is protected by an acid labile group such as trityl, 4,4 dimethoxytrityl or pixyl 9 phenyl 9 xanthyl , which is removed before each condensation step and at the end of synthesis. Such groups may be removed by treatment with an acidic reagent such as di or trichloroacetic acid in an anhydrous solvent such as dichloromethane or chloroform, at ambient temperature. The expression of the DNA polymer encoding the modified t PA in a recombinant host cell may be carried out by means of a replicable expression vector capable, in the host cell, of expressing the DNA polymer. The expression vector is novel and also forms part of the invention. The replicable expression vector may be prepared in accordance with the invention, by cleaving a vector compatible with the host cell to provide a linear DNA segment having an intact replicon, and combining said linear segment with the DNA polymer encoding the modified t PA under ligating conditions. The choice of vector will be determined in part by the host cell, which may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Suitable vectors include plasmids, bacteriophages and cosmids. The preparation of the replicable expression vector may be carried out conventionally with appropriate enzymes for restriction, polymerisation and ligation of the DNA, by procedures described in, for example, Maniatis The recombinant host cell is prepared, in accordance with the invention, by transforming a host cell with a replicable expression vector of the invention under transforming conditions. Suitable transforming conditions are conventional and are described in, for example, Maniatis The choice of transforming conditions is determined by the host cell. Thus, a bacterial host such as Culturing the transformed host cell under conditions permitting expression of the DNA polymer is carried out conventionally, as described in, for example, Maniatis The modified t PA expression product is recovered by conventional methods according to the host cell. Thus, where the host cell is bacterial, such as It will be appreciated that, depending upon the host cell, the modified t PA prepared in accordance with the invention may be glycosylated to varying degrees. Furthermore, as observed by Pohl In a preferred embodiment, a modified tissue type plasminogen activator enzyme is prepared by a process which comprises effecting a deletion mutagenesis upon the cDNA which codes for tissue type plasminogen activator using an oligodeoxyribonucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence which is complementary or corresponds to a region of the t PA cDNA extending 5 from nucleotide 339 inclusive, said sequence being joined directly to a nucleotide sequence which is complementary or corresponds to a region extending 3 from nucleotide 451 inclusive of t PA cDNA and expressing the modified cDNA in a prokaryote or eurokaryote host. The oligodeoxyribonucleotide employed in the preferred embodiment is suitably at least 16 nucleotides in length, preferably at least 25 nucleotides in length. Suitably it contains at least 8 and preferably at least 12 nucleotides which are complementary to nucleotides on each side of the deletion region. A preferred oligodeoxyribonucleotide is of sequence I . 5 d CGTGGCCCTGGTACTTTTGACAGGC 3 I The oligodeoxyribonucleotide of sequence I is novel and as such forms part of the invention. The 12 bases at the 5 end of the oligodeoxyribo nucleotide I are complementary to t PA cDNA nucleotides 462 451 inclusive and the 13 bases at the 3 end of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide I are complementary to the t PA cDNA nucleotides 339 327 inclusive. The oligodeoxyribonucleotide of sequence I can be used to delete the portion of cDNA which codes for amino acids 51 to 87 inclusive of t PA. It is believed that the cDNA obtained following mutagenesis is similar to that of Pennica et al, 1983, Nature, The t PA obtained by expression of this cDNA is expected to have a similar amino acid sequence to that described in Pennica The modified t PA of the invention comprises the B chain of native t PA linked to t PA A chain modified in the region of the growth factor domain. This modified t PA A chain may be employed as one chain of a fibrinolytically active hybrid protein such as disclosed in EP 0155387. The modified t PA A chain, DNA encoding the modified t PA A chain and a hybrid protein comprising the modified t PA A chain linked to the B chain of a fibrinolytically active protease, the catalytic site of which is optionally blocked by a removable blocking group, all form part of the invention. The hybrid protein may be used in any of the methods and compositions described hereinafter for the modified t PA itself. The modified t PA of the invention is suitably administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising modified t PA of the invention in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions according to the invention may be formulated in accordance with routine procedures as pharmaceutical compositions adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically compositions for intravenous administration are solutions of the sterile enzyme in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary the composition may also include a solubilising agent to keep the modified t PA in solution and a local anaesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of injection. Generally, the modified t PA will be supplied in unit dosage form for example as a dry powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of protein in activity units. Where the modified t PA includes a removable blocking group an indication of the time within which the free protein will be liberated may be given. Where the protein is to be administered by infusion, it will be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade Water for Injection or saline. Where the protein is to be administered by injection, it is dispensed with an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline. The injectable or infusable composition will be made up by mixing the ingredients prior to administration. The quantity of material administered will depend upon the amount of fibrinolysis required and the speed with which it is required, the seriousness of the thromboembolic condition and position and size of the clot. The precise dose to be employed and mode of administration must per force in view of the nature of the complaint be decided according to the circumstances by the physician supervising treatment. However, in general, a patient being treated for a mature thrombus will generally receive a daily dose of from 0.01 to 10 mg kg of body weight either by injection in for example up to five doses or by infusion. Within the above indicated dosage range, no adverse toxicological effects are indicated with the compounds of the invention. Accordingly, in a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of treating thrombotic diseases, which comprises administering to the sufferer an effective non toxic amount of modified t PA of the invention. The invention also provides a modified t PA of the invention for use as an active therapeutic substance and, in particular, for use in the treatment of thrombotic diseases. The following Examples illustrate the invention. The above mentioned 25 mer was prepared by the solid phase phosphotriester method on a polydimethylacrylamide kieselguhr support using dimer building blocks following the standard procedure described in Chemical and Enzymatic Synthesis of Gene Fragments A Laboratory Manual , Chapter 1, Verlag Chemie, Weinheim 1982 . The 25 mer was purified by ion exchange HPLC on a PARTISIL 10 SAX column eluted at 2ml min with 0.001 M and 0.3 M KH₂PO₄, pH 6.3, in 6 4 formamide water solvents A and B respectively , using a gradient of 0 100 B over 50 min at room temperature. Detection was at 270nm. In preparative runs, the peak eluting after 53.7 min. was collected. This was followed by reversed phase HPLC on the partially purified 25 mer on a µ BONDAPAK C 18 column eluted at 2ml min with 0.1 M ammonium acetate solvent A and 0.1 M ammonium acetate acetonitrile 2 8 v v, solvent B , using 92 A isocratically for 4 minutes, followed by a gradient of 92 70 A over 41 minutes at room temperature. Detection was at 270 nm. In preparative runs, the material with a retention time of 15.8 min. was collected. This material was purified by preparative gel electrophoresis using standard methodology as described in the above reference. Sequence verification was carried out by the method of Maxam and Gilbert see A.M. Maxam and W. Gilbert, Sequencing End Labelled DNA with Base Specific Chemical Cleavages in Methods in Enzymology, ed. L. Grossman and K. Moldave, Academic Press Inc. London Ltd. 1980 , Vol. 65, p.p. 499 560. The length of the oligonucleotide was verified by a sizing experiment in which the electrophoretic mobility of the oligonucleotide was compared with that of oligo dT fragments contained in a commercially available oligo dT ladder. In general the cleavage of about 1µg of plasmid DNA or DNA fragments was effected using about 5 units of a restriction enzyme or enzymes in about 20µl of an appropriate buffer solution. Transformation of plasmid DNA into RNA was isolated from the TRBM6 cell line Browne A further cDNA clone λTR10, was isolated from a second TRBM6 cDNA library. The cDNA library was constructed using the λgt10 vector as described in DNA Cloning Volume I, Chapters 2 and 3 Ed. D.M. Glover IRL Press, 1985 . The library was screened using appropriate t PA specific oligonucleotide and plasmid probes using methods described previously Browne The following double priming mixture was set up in a total volume of 5.6µl 0.2pmoles template DNA mTR 30 single stranded form, see Example 2 0.625pmoles kinased mutagenic primer as described above 0.375 pmoles kinased M13 specific primer Collaborative Research Inc., Product No. 20205 0.6µl 10 seq. buffer 0.1M Tris Cl pH 7.5, 0.05M MgCl₂ . The mixture was heated in an Eppendorf tube at 56 C for 6 minutes and then allowed to cool to room temperature for at least 15 minutes. To the priming mixture was added 6µl of the following mixture 1µl of 10mM solution of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP, 4µl total 2µl 1OmM rATP 2µl 10 seq. buffer 12 µl H₂O 2 units T4 DNA ligase 2 units DNA Polymerase I Klenow fragment . The mixure was incubated for 16 h at 25 C The DNA was transformed in 1µl aliquots into The filters were washed at a series of different temperatures in 6 SSC plus 0.1 SDS 3 5 minutes at 30 C 5 minutes at 38 C 5 minutes at 45 C 5 minutes at 50 C 5 minutes at 52.5 C 5 minutes at 58 C. After each wash the filters were exposed, wet with an intensifying screen to Fuji RX 100 X ray film. DNA fragments were isolated from LMP agarose gels as described by Maniatis Synthetic linkers encoding restriction enzyme sites, were kinased and ligated to blunt ended DNA as described by Maniatis Vector DNA was dephosphorylated, where appropriate, by treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase as described by Maniatis Cell preparation cells were trypsinised and plated out at 10⁶ cells per 60mm dish and left overnight in growth medium 10 Serum, 1 stock solution of penicillin streptomycin Flow Laboratories, 1 Glutamine, 1 stock solution of non essential amino acids Flow Laboratories, in Eagles MEM at 37 C in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 5 CO₂ 95 air. Transfection procedure The transfection used calcium coprecipitation is described in DNA Cloning Ed. D.M. Glover Chap. 15, C. Gorman . Glycerol shock and 1OmM butyrate treatment were used. Following transfection the cells were rested overnight in growth medium. Overlay Agarose Indubiose A₃₇ , 2.4g in 95ml Eagles MEM Gibco heated to melting point in a bunsen flame, was then placed in a water bath maintained at 48 C. 5.6 ml of fibrinogen 20mg ml were diluted 1 1 with 5.6 ml of Eagles MEM containing an extra 7 mg ml of NaCl and retained on ice. 3.3 ml of Eagles MEM no additions were aliquoted into a bijou containing 86µl of bovine thrombin at 50 NIH Units ml retained on ice . The cells were washed 3 times with Eagles MEM to remove serum. The thrombin and fibrinogen were warmed to 37 C in a water bath. 9.5 ml agarose were aliquoted into a pre warmed universal. The thrombin was added to the agar, followed by the fibrinogen. The gel was poured over the cell layer and incubated at 37 C until lysis zones appeared. Modified t PA was extracted from cultures of Expression of modified t PA was then induced with 0.1mM IPTG isopropyl β D thiogalactopyranoside and ZnSO₄ was added to a final concentration of 0.5mM to minimise bacterial protease activity Gross DNA coding for a novel, modified t PA protein has been produced using the above mentioned oligonucleotide Example 1 with sequence 5 d C G T G G C C C T G G T A C T T T T G A C A G G C 3 This oligonucleotide is complementary to nucleotides 327 339 inclusive and 451 462 inclusive of t PA cDNA Pennica All manipulation of the DNA referred to below was carried out as described in the Methods Section. A cDNA clone coding for the protein t PA was isolated from mRNA prepared from the TRBM6 cell line described in Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 1985, This construct did not give good yields of either single or double stranded DNA. The t PA cDNA was put out of reading frame by cutting double stranded DNA from the clone mTR10 with the enzymes BamHI and HindIII. The whole DNA mixture comprising the cleaved vector DNA and the t PA insert DNA was blunt ended and religated. The resulting construct was shown by DNA sequencing to have the following structure at the point of insertion indicating that the t PA cDNA is out of reading frame with respect to the M13 lacZ promoter. This clone will be known as mTR30. Site directed mutagenesis was carried out on the clone mTR30 as described in Methods. After screening, ten duplicate positive signals were selected. DNA sequencing was carried out on single stranded DNA from these isolates, of which one showed the desired change in DNA sequence. An example of this changed DNA sequence, a deletion of 37 codons, is shown below. The BglII fragment carrying the modified t PA sequence was excised from mTR50 by restriction with BglII. This was subsequently ligated with BamHI cut pUC8. Competent Modified t PA was expressed from the fused lacZ t PA coding DNA in The vector pRSV β globin Gorman The sequences encoding the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat RSV LTR , 5 region of t PA cDNA, and Simian virus 40 SV40 3 sequences were then reconstructed in pAT153 in such a way that they formed a single XhoI fragment. Firstly, the RSV LTR was removed from pRSV β globin by digestion of 6µg DNA with 4U of SfaNI for 2.5h. The DNA was then phenol chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, resuspended and blunt ended. XhoI linkers were kinased and ligated to the DNA at ambient temperature for 8h and overnight at 4 C, then incubated at 70 C for 15 minutes to inactivate the ligase and ethanol precipitated. The linkered DNA was then resuspended and digested with 15 units each of HindIII and XhoI for 6h and a 500 bp fragment corresponding to the RSV LTR isolated after electrophoresis in a 1 LMP agarose gel. This DNA fragment was cloned into pAT153 prepared as follows 6µg of pAT153 was digested with 30U of EcoRI for 2h, then phenol chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated. The DNA was resuspended, blunt ended, ligated to XhoI linkers, resuspended and digested with HindIII and XhoI as above. A 3.4kb fragment was isolated after electrophoresis in a 1 LMP agarose gel and ethanol precipitated with the 500bp fragment above. The DNA was ligated to give pTREO. The 0.2kb fragment encoding the 5 part of the t PA cDNA was isolated from pTRE1 by digesting 10µg of DNA with 30 units each of HindIII and BglII for 2 hours and the fragment isolated after electrophoresis in a 1 LMP agarose gel. This fragment was cloned into pAT153 prepared as follows 5µg of pAT153 was digested to completion with BamHI. Following phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA was resuspended and blunt ended then ligated to kinased BglII linkers. The DNA was phenol chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, resuspended and digested with 30 units each of HindIII and BglII for 3h. The large DNA band was isolated after electrophoresis in a 1 LMP agarose gel, ethanol precipitated with the 0.2kb fragment above and ligated together to give pTRE8. A DNA fragment encoding the SV40 sequences from pTRE1 was isolated as follows 5µg of pTRE1 was digested with 60 units of EcoRI for 2h, blunt ended and ligated to XhoI linkers as described previously. After phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA was resuspended and digested sequentially with BglII and XhoI. A 1.6kb band encoding the SV40 sequences was isolated after electrophoresis in a 1 LMP agarose gel and cloned into pTRE8 prepared as follows 5µg of pTRE8 was digested with 15 units of SalI for 3½h, blunt ended and ligated to XhoI linkers as described previously. Following phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA was resuspended and digested sequentially with 30 units of BglII for 1h and 10 units XhoI for 2h. The large DNA band was isolated after electrophoresis in a 1 LMP agarose gel, ethanol precipitated with the 1.6kb fragment above and ligated to give pTRE11. A 2kb DNA fragment encoding the 5 t PA cDNA sequences, SV40 sequences and part of pAT153 were cleaved from pTRE11 by digestion of 5µg DNA with 30 units HindIII and 6 units XmaIII for 6h. After electrophoresis in a 1 LMP agarose gel a 2kb band was isolated and cloned into pTREO prepared as follows 4.8µg pTREO was digested with HindIII and XmaIII as above and the large DNA fragment isolated after electrophoresis in a 1 LMP agarose gel. This fragment was ethanol precipitated with the 2kb fragment above and ligated to give pTRE12. t PA cDNA BglII fragments were cloned into the unique BglII site of pTRE12 as shown in Figure 4. pTRE7 contains a 2kb BglII fragment, encoding the mature t PA protein and part of the 3 untranslated region, derived from a cDNA library produced from TRBM6 cells, Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 1985, Expression of modified and unmodified t PA from transfected mouse C127 cells 24 hours post transfection was detected using the fibrin agarose overlay technique as described in the Methods section. Lytic zones were obtained from pTRE15 unmodified t PA and pTRE24 modified t PA transfected cells, but not from cells transfected with the empty parent vector pTRE12 t PA . In the figures Abbreviations are as in Figure 3. t PA wild type is cDNA encoding normal t PA, t PA mutant is cDNA encoding altered t PA.
