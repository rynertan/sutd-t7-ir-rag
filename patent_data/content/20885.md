The disclosed class of compounds in this invention has pronounced analgesic activity that is effective in the relief of pain.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The most widely used drug to combat pain is still morphine. There are severe effects of this drug, however, for prolonged use of morphine generally leads to physiological and psychological dependency on the drug.In addition, it has a depressing effect on respiration.A tireless and expensive search for an analgesic that would be as potent as morphine, but free of its dangerous effects, has been carried on. Many analgesic disclosures related to the morphine model have been synthesized, the best known of which is pethidine. This was originally thought to be a non addicting drug, but was soon found to have dangerous addiction liability. Other synthetic analgesics include a group of substances called benzomorphans. The best known member of this group is phenazocine, but like morphine, this is also dangerously addicting.

The benzocyclooctene derivatives of this invention show good activity in a modified Randall Selitto test. Good activity in this test would indicate useful analgesic activity. The benzocyclooctene derivatives of this invention generally have some narcotic antagonist activity as well as agonist activity. This mixture of agonist and antagonist activity can be advantageous since it is thought this will result in reduced side effects. A further feature of this invention resides in the fact that the compounds of this invention can be produced by synthetic means more conveniently than are members of the morphine family of naturally occurring alkaloidal analgesics. The compounds of this invention are administered orally or subcutaneously, preferably as an aqueous solution of the hydrochloride salt and in the range of about 1 100 mg. kg. per day. Various tests in animals have been carried out to show the ability of the compounds of this invention to exhibit reactions that can be correlated with activity in humans. One such test as outlined by Charles A. Winter and Lars Flataker in The Journal of Pharmacology andExperimental Therapeutics, Volume 150, No. 1, pages 165171, shows the ability of the instant compounds to exhibit analgesic effect. Measurements are made of the reaction threshold to pressure in the hind paws of rats injected with a phlogistic agent. These are compared with known analgesic drugs and marked increased effects can be found.Drug dosages of up to 18 mg. kg. are administered by the subcutaneous route. The experiments are carried out onSprague Dawley feale rats weighing from 60 to 80 grams.The response threshold is determined by applying pressure to the foot and reading on a manometer the pressure at which an audible squeak is elicited. Groups of ten rats are used for each test and the average reading is recorded. The benzocyclooctenes are conveniently prepared by the following method from known starting materials. The starting materials are 5,6,7,8,9,10 hexahydro 6,9 methanobenzocyclooctene ll one and are readily prepared by the reaction of a,a dihalo xylene or an appropriately substituted xylene and a cyclic ketone derivative.Thus, for example, reaction of a,a dibromo xylene and the pyrrolidine enamine of cyclopentanone or cyclohexanone in an aprotic such as acetonitrile produces the desired 6,9methanobenzocyclooctene ll one of the corresponding benzocyclononen ll one. In order to introduce the phenolic hydroxyl group into the cyclooctene ll one compounds in a one step reaction, the starting ketone is treated in strongly acid solution, preferably in trifluoroacetic acid, with thallium trifluoroacetate at a temperature of from 00 500C. and preferably between 100 300C. The reaction is allowed to proceed for a period of from 1 24 hours and is then treated with an oxidizing agent, as for example lead tetraacetate, and the resulting mixture is then stirred with heating, preferably at reflux temperature of the reaction mixture for a period of from 1 5 hours. The entire reaction mixture is then treated with triphenyl phosphine in order to free the hydroxy cyclooctene ll one from its complex, and then the desired ketone purified by removal of the reaction solvent by evaporation under reduced pressure followed by extraction of the residual material with chloroform, and the chloroform extract washed with water and dried to yield the desired product, which is conveniently purified by crystallization from a solvent. The ll keto compounds prepared according to the previous procedure are readily converted to the corresponding ll amino compounds by conversion to the corresponding oximes, followed by catalytic reduction to the amine. Thus, for example, d,l 5,6,7,8,9,l0 hexahydro 2 hydroxy 6, 9 methanobenzocyclooctene ll one is converted to the corresponding ll oximino compound by refluxing in the presence of an approximately equimolar amount of hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Following formation of the oxime, the reaction mixture is diluted with water and extracted to isolate the oxime, which is then further purified by chromatography on silica gel, followed by elution with chloroform containing traces of methanol. Another process for the preparation of the corresponding N,N dialkyl ll endo amino 6, 9 methanobenzo cyclooctene includes treatment of the corresponding cyclooctene ll one directly with a mixture of an N,N dialkyl amine and an alkali metal cyanoborohydride, preferably sodium cyanoborohydride, for a period of 1 4 days at a temperature of 0 500C. with direct production of the desired compound which may be purified by extraction with chloroform and recrystallization from a loweralkanol. A process for the preparation of the compounds of the present invention which are substituted by alkyl substituents, e.g., methyl substitutents in the 6 and or 9 positions, begins with the treatment of an a,a dihaloxylene with an alkylated or dialkylated derivative of the appropriate cycloalkanone enamine. Thus, for example, a,c dibromoxylene is treated with the pyrrolidine enamine of 2,5 dimethylcyclopentanone to produce the corresponding 6, 9 dimethyl 5,6,7,8,9, 10 hexahydro 6 ,9 methanobenzocyclo octene ll one, followed by thallation as described hereinabove, to introduce the corresponding 2 hydroxy compound and subsequent conversion to the oxime, followed by catalytic reduction to the desired d,l ll endo amino 6,9 di methyl 5,6,7,8,9,l0 hexahydro 6,9 methanobenzocyclooctene. In an alternate procedure for preparation of theN substituted ll carboxamidocyclooctene, the known starting ketone d,l 5,6,7,8,9,l0 hexahydro 2 hydroxy 6,9 methano benzocyclooctene ll one is treated in solution with sodium cyanide and ammonia to introduce an ll amino and an 11cyano substituent with resultant production of d,l ll endo amino 5,6,7,8,9, l0 hexahydro 2 hydroxy 6, 9 methanobenzo cyclooctene ll exo carbonitrile, which is hydrolyzed by treatment with a strong acid to produce the corresponding ll exo carboxylic acid. This ll endo amino ll exo carboxylic acid is then converted to the corresponding ll endo formamido compound by treatment of the amino acid compound with a mixture of formic acetic anhydride in formic acid.The resulting d,l ll endo formamido 5,6,7,8,9,l0 hexa hydro 2 hydroxy 6, 9 methanobenzocyclooctene ll carboxylic acid is converted to the corresponding mixed anhydride by treatment with ethyl chloroformate followed by reaction with 2 phenethylamine to produce the desired N substituted amide d,l ll endo formamido 5, 6,7,8,9,10 hexahydro 2 hydroxy N 2 phenethyl 6,9 methanobenzocyclooctene llcarboxamide accompanied by a small amount of a cyclized reaction by product 5 R,ll R 5 S,ll S l ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,6 hexahydro 8 hydroxy l 2 phenylethyl spiro l H imidazo 4,ll 2,5 methanobenzocyclooctene 5 4H one. The compounds of Formula V may be prepared by a procedure which employs as the starting material the d, l ll endo amino ll exo carboxy 5, 6,7, 8,9,10 hexahydro 2 hydroxy 6,9 methanobenzocyclooctene prepared as described in the paragraph immediately above. The starting material is first reduced with, e.g., diborane, to pro duce the corresponding ll hydroxymethyl compound. The ll endo amino and ll hydroxymethyl groups of this compound are then converted to an aziridine group by treating the compound with tosyl chloride. The tosylated compound of the second step is then added to the appropriate phenoxide or substituted phenoxie, or phenyl or substi tuted phenylalkox1ide, which have, in turn, been prepared by reacting a 50 sodium hydride dispersion with the appropriate phenol or phenylalkanol.This step produces the desired compound, except for the tosyl group remaining on the ll endo amino substituent. This tosylamide is converted to the corresponding amine by treatment with sodium metal and liquid ammonia. The following examples are provided for purposes of illustration and are not intended to be limitative of the invention. The starting material may be prepared by known procedures as described in step 1 of example 1.
