# Continuously variable transmission downshift control.

## Abstract
A continuously variable transmission 10 of the expan sible frusto conical pulley type having fluid expansion chambers 26, 44 controlling expansion and contraction of the V groove 21, 39 includes a fluid control circuit having a ratio control pressure regulator valve 81 , a ratio relief valve 91 connected across the ratio control regulator valve 81 , providing for rapid down shift of the pulley combination while maintaining non slip engagement between pulley discs 14, 91 13, 38 and a flexible transmission band 13 of trapezoidal cross section.
