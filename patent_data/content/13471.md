# Papermaker s fabric and method of making the fabric.

## Abstract
A papermaker s fabric, for example a dryer felt, a wet felt, or a forming wire screen fabric, comprises a plurality of crosswise yarns 12 disposed in a plurality of separate layers, each of which lies in a plane parallel to the crosswise plane of the fabric, and a plurality of lengthwise yarns 14 interwoven with the crosswise yarns 12 to bind the layers of crosswise yarns 12 together to form a multilayer fabric. Structurally, the crosswise yarns 12 in a given layer are separated from the adjacent crosswise yarns 12 in adjacent layers at points along their length by void spaces 16 within the body of the woven fabric, and these voids 16 determine the permeability of the fabric. The invention proposes to control the void vol ume of a papermaker s fabric, hence controlling its permeabil ity, by at least partly filling the voids 16 with a synthetic, polymeric, thermoplastic resin, cellular foam 22 . Preferably the foam is introduced by weaving into the fabric structure a plurality of stuffer yarns 18 which have been coated with a a foam forming composition 20 , and then causing the com position 20 to foam in situ in the fabric.
