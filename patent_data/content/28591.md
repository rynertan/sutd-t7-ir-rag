# Method of uninterrupted operation of a current supply installation and apparatus for the method.

## Abstract
A method of uninterrupted operation of a current supply installation, which via a charger in the form of a primary switched rectifier with a transformer 16 charges a battery 28 and carries a load 30 when the operating voltage is available to a sufficient extent, but for a voltage drop or break in voltage automatically disconnects the battery from the charger and instead supplies the load with voltage from the battery. The battery voltage is hereby chopped into square wave form and transformed up via the secondary side 20 of the transformer 16 to the voltage required for the load 30 . A diode 38 is suitably connected between the load 30 and battery 28 , for allowing the battery voltage to act directly on the load as long as this voltage is sufficiently high. The invention also relates to a current supply installation according to the method, in which the chopping is performed with the aid of one or two square wave generators.
