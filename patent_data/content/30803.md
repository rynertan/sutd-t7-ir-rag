# Apparatus and method for treating an aqueous effluent which contains suspended oil particles.

## Abstract
The apparatus has a first filter stage 10 provided by a relatively coarse layer 15 of anthracite particles superim posed on a relatively finer layer 16 of garnet particles. Liquid leaving the first filter stage 10 is passed through a biological percolating filter column 13 to an outlet line 14. Successive flow of the effluent through the layers 15, 16 is particularly effective to remove oil which the column 13 would have diffi culty in treating.

## Description
The invention relates to apparatus and processes for treating aqueous effluent to reduce the oil content there of. It is known from UK patent 1449342 to carry out treatment of aqueous effluent which includes sus nded oil particles by passing the effluent first through a nd fil ter to reduce the oil content, and subsequently through a biological percolating filter which reduces thu biological oxygen demand BOD of the effluent. Since the size of a biological filter required to achieve a given BOD and outlet oil content is dopgndent on the oil content of the inlet liquid it is desirablo that the first filtration stage shall have the highest attainable efficiency, in terms of oil removed from a given aqueous effluent, consistent with a desired rate of effluent throughput and constraints of size of the filter apparatus In particular, suspended oil droplets can have advorao effects on the performance of the biological percolating filter mainly as a result of coating the biological filtor compon ents with an oil film. In many operating conditions limitations may be imposed on the permissible size of the filter apparatus as a whole. Improving the efficiency of the first filtration stage reduces both the load on the biological filtor and the aforesaid adverse effects thereon. The aforesaid improvement in efficiency also allows the sizes of the biological and or first stage filters to be reduced. Alternatively, for filters of a given size a better filtration is obtainable. It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for treating aqueous effluent having suspended oil particles in which the efficiency of the first filtration stage is higher than that attainable by known processes, or alternatively to provide a process having a first filtration step in which an efficiency corresponding to that of known processes is attainable by an apparatus of smaller size than is required for known processes. According to the invention an apparatus for treating an aqueous effluent which contains suspended oil, comprises a first filter material consisting essentially of relatively coarser particles, a second filter material consisting essentially of relatively finer particles, a biological percolating filter arrangement, and means for passing said effluent successively through said first and second filter materials and subsequently through said biological filter arrangement. According to another aspect of the invention a method of treating an aqueous effluent which contains suspended oil comprises passing said effluent successively through a first, relatively coarser, particulate material, through a second, relatively finer, particulate material, and subsequently through a biological filter arrangement. An embodiment of the invention will now be more particularly described by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawing which shows a treatment apparatus diagrammatically. As shown in the drawing the apparatus comprises a first filter stage 10 for reducing the oil content of an aqueous effluent supplied through a pipe 11. Liquid leaving the first filter stage 10 is supplied through a pipe 12 to a biological percolating filter column 13, of a known type, from which filtered liquid is drawn through an outlet 14. The first filter stage 10 comprises at least two layers of filter material, through which the effluent passes doT n wardly. A layer 15 of anthracite having a particle size of between .5mm and 3mm is super imposed on a layer 16 of garnet having a particle size of between .25mm and imam. In general, the linear dimensions of the anthracite particles are between 1.1 and 3 times those of the garnet particles. One or more additional layers of filter material, as for example, of conventional sand, may be interposed between the garnet and anthracite. Additionally a particulate filter material 17 whose specific gravity is less than that of anthracite may be super imposed thereon.The anthracite layer 15 provides a coarse filter which first removes the larger oil particles, and the garnet layer 16 provides a fine filter which subsequently removes the smaller oil particles. Suspended solids in the effluent are also removed by the layers 15, 16. The layer 16 rests on a relatively shallow layer 18 of coarse garnet particles, which are in turn supported by a layer 19 of gravel, the purpose of the layer 18 being to prevent the fine particles in the layer 16 from migrating into the gravel layer 19. The layers 15 to 19 are contained within a vessel 20 to which the effluent is delivered through a spreader 21 in such a way as to be delivered evenly over the whole cross section of the layers 15, 16 normal to the direction of effluent flow. The liquid is removed from the vessel 20 through an array of collector pipes 22, of a known type, which are located within the gravel layer 19.The thicknesses of the respective layers 15, 16 of garnet and anthracite, as well as the particle sizes of these materials, are selected according to the anticipated operating conditions, as for example the oil content and size of oil particles in the effluent to be treated. The crosssection of the filter layers 15, 16 is such that effluent is delivered thereto at between 2.125 and 13 litres minute sq. metre of cross sectional area. The aforesaid filter layers require backwashing to remove accumulated deposits and this may be effected in a known manner by shutting a valve 23 in the line 12 and supplying backwash liquid through a pipe 24 and a valve 25.It has been found that the differences between the specific gravities of garnet, anthracite, gravel, and any material in the layer 17, as well as the different particle sizes of the layers 16, 18 serves to keep all of the layers 15 to 19 separate during backwashing. The apparatus and process of the present invention have been found to provide substantial operating advantages over known oil reducing liquid treatment systems. In particular the relatively larger particles in the layer 15 have been found to cause suspended oil droplets to coalesce and be retained in this layer, the relatively finer particles in the layer 16 acting to trap the smaller droplets of oil remaining. Additionally, the use of anthracite in the layer 15 has been found to improve the coalescing action of this layer, since anthracite is more readily wetted by oil than the silica sand previously used for filters of this type. With typical values of suspended oil content in the input liquid, the aforesaid coalescing action has been found to permit a higher throughput of liquid through the apparatus that has proved possible with single material first stage filters, consistent with maintaining a predetermined acceptable level of suspended oil content in the liquid in the pipe 12. Typically such a level is between 5 and 15 p.p.m., but these values may vary in dependence on the composition of the effluent being treated. It has also been found that in the apparatus of the present invention, sudden increases in either the rate of effluent flow or of the oil content of this effluent, have less effect on the oil content of the water in the pipe 12. The apparatus of the present invention is thus more effective than known sand filters in providing the complementary oil removing effect described in UK patent 1449342.
