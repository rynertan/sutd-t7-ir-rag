# Hydrophilized membrane of porous hydrophobic material and process of producing same.

## Abstract
A hydrophilized membrane of a porous hydrophobic material having micropores each defined by a surface at least part of which is coated with polyethylene glycol. Water is allowed to pass through the micropores. There is also disclosed a process for hydrophilizing such a porous hyd rophobic membrane.
