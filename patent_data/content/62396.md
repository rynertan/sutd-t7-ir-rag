# ALUMINIUM CAN DETECTOR

## Abstract
Apparatus for determining whether an object 5 is an aluminium can comprises an oscillator circuit 60 for generating a reference signal. A drive coil 10 responsive to the reference signal emits a magnetic drive signal towards the object 5 and a sense coil 20 generates a detector signal from the magnetic drive signal after it has passed through the object 5 . A phase comparator 3 is connected to receive the refer ence signal and the detector signal for generating a bilevel comparison signal whose duty cycle indicates the degree of phase coherence between the signals and an analyser circuit R8, C7, 40 responsive to the comparison signal indicates that the object is not an aluminium can if the duty cycle is greater than the determined values.
