# Electrode layer treating process.

## Abstract
Structures such as gas electrodes containing a wetproof ing backing or layer containing polytetrafluoroethylene in conjunction with a water soluble pore forming agent and a PTFE containing active layer are contacted with an alkylene polyol or other water soluble or water miscible organic material having a plurality of hydroxyl groups, at a tempera ture ranging from about 50 to about 100 C for a sufficient time to wet the PTFE containing active layer thoroughly, and the thus treated electrode is then contacted with water in one or more washing steps substantially to remove the pore forming agent. Between the hot soak with the alkylene polyol or equivalent material and the one or more water washes, the electrode can optionally be dried.
