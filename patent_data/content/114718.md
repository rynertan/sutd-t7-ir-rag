# Serial dot printer for office machines.

## Abstract
Printing is effected on paper 82 passing over a platen 80 by applying high voltage pulses from a transformer 200 between electrically conductive ink 102 and a counter electrode 89 , so as to eject dots of ink through a nozzle 106 . Each dot is created by a pulse of current I‚ÇÅ drawn from a storage capacitor 402 through the transformer primary 210 under control of a switching transistor 198 controlled in turn by pulses TP . The pulses TP are provided by a monostable circuit 415 which has a time constant network 420, 421 energised by a potential divider 418,419 con nected across the storage capacitor 402 . The arrangement is such that, when the voltage across the capacitor 402 falls during rapidly repeated dot printing, the time constant of the monostable circuit 415 is increased and the total pulse energy supplied to the transformer 200 is maintained, thereby to maintain uniform dot density on the paper 82 .
