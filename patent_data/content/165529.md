## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING PHENYL METHACRYLATE OR ACRYLATEPriority June 6, 1984, Japan, No. 116163 1984 P The present invention relates to a process for producing a phenyl ester of methacrylic acid or acrylic acid hereinafter referred te as meth acrylic acid .Phenyl esters of meth acrylic acid are useful monomers which can be polymerized to provide polymers having a high refractive index, a low hygroscopicity and a high thermal resistance. It is generally considered that they cannot be synthesized directly from a carboxylic acid and a phenol, since the reaction equilibrium inclines greatly toward the hydrolysis. Therefore, phenyl meth acrylate has previously been synthesized from meth acryloyl chloride by a process comprising complicated steps consequently leading to an expensive product.A process wherein the carboxylic acid per se is used as a starting material is disclosed in JACS 75, 5416 1953 .According to this process, phenyl methacrylate is synthesized from methacrylic acid and phenol by using polyphosphoric acid as a dehydrating agent. In this process, however, polyphosphoric acid is used in the high amount of 2 3 part by weight polyphosphoric acid per part by weight of phenol and the yield is as low amounting only up te 55 . This process is thus industrially not advantageous.Under the above described circumstances it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing useful phenyl meth acrylate efficiently and at low costs.This object is achieved by the process according to claim 1. The subclaims relate to preferred embodiments of this process.The process of the present invention for producing a phenyl methEacrylate is characterized in that meth acrylic acid is subjected to a dehydration reaction with a compound having a phenolic hydroxyl group in the presence of an acid catalyst at a temperature of at least 170 C. The compounds having a phenolic hydroxyl group usable in the process of the present invention include, for example, phenol, p chlorophenol, 2,3 ,5 trichlorophenol, penta chlorophenol, pentabromophenol, p bromophenol, p methoxy phenol, o methoxyphenol, p benzylphenol, p phenylphenol, o phenylphenol, p phenoxyphenol, p ethoxyphenol, o butoxyphenol, p nitrophenol, p cyanophenol, p hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid, p hydroxystyrene, o cresol, 2 hydroxy pxylene, p methoxymethylphenol, o methoxyrnethylphenol, p t butylphenol, p toluylphenol, p tetrahydrofurfurylphenol, 6 hydroxyquinoline and 2 hydroxytetralin. The compounds having a phenolic hydroxyl group are not particularly limited provided that they do not comprise a group which hinders the reaction.The amount of the compound having a phenol hydroxyl group is also not particularly limited. However, when this compound is more expensive than the meth acrylic acid, it is used preferably in an amount of up to 1 equivalent, and particularly in an amount of 0.2 to 1.0 equivalents per equivalent of meth acrylic acid. When the former compound is less expensive than the latter compound, the former is used preferably in an amount of at least 1 equivalent and particularly in an amount of 1.0 to 4.0 equivalents per equivalent of the latter. The use of the reactants in such amounts is effective for the production of the intended phenol esters at low costs.According to the process of the present invention, the dehydration reaction is carried out at a temperature of at least 1100C, wherein preferably a solvent is used.The solvent used is not particularly limited provided it has a boiling point of at least 1100C and is inert and immiscible with water. Even a solvent having a boiling point of less than llO C can be used in such a small amount that the reaction temperature can be kept at 1100C or higher. Solvents having a boiling point lower than that of acrylic or methacrylic acid are preferred. Examples usable solvents include toluene, xylene, chlorobenzole, n octane and n nonane. The amount of the solvent is such that the dehydration reaction proceeds satisfactorily and is therefore not particularly limited.The dehydration reaction according to the process of the present invention is carried out at a temperature of at least 110 C, preferably of more than 1250C, and particularly in the range of 1250C to the boiling point of meth acrylic acid When a reaction temperature higher than the boiling point of metnXacrylic acid is used, an unfavourable polymerization of meth acrylic acid is caused.On the other hand a practical reaction rate cannot be obtained at a temperature of below ll0QC. Preferably the reaction is carried out under atmospheric pressure so as to avoid the use of a complicated apparatus even though the reaction may be also carried out under reduced pressure or elevated pressure The reaction time, which varies with the reaction temperature, the catalyst and the starting compound having a phenolic hydroxyl group, comprises usually 5 to 30 h. When an alcohol different rroin the compound having a phenolic hydroxyl group is used for the esterification under the conditions reaction temperature and reaction timer of the present invention, meth acrylic acid or the phenyl meth acrylate is polymerized inevitably.Thus, the reaction conditions employed in the present invention are specific ones to be employed for the reaction of only the compound having a phenol hydroxyl group.The acid catalysts used in the present invention are those used generally for esterification reactions. Particularly preferred are sulfuric acid, a combination of sulfuric acid and boric acid or p toluenesulfonic acid.The amount of the catalyst may be equal to the amount generally used in esterification reactions. This amount generally is 0.1 to 30 wt. E based on meth acrylic acid. Though the use of a polymerization inhibitor which does not participate in reactions similar to that of the present invention is generally preferred to inhibit the polymerization, the dehydration according to the present invention can be carried out without using a polymerization inhibitor by introducing air into the reaction system.The catalyst used, the unreacted meth acrylic acid and the unreacted compound having a phenolic hydroxyl group can be removed easily from the reaction product by washing it with an aqueous alkali solution after completion of the reaction. By a distillation or recrystallization conducted after the washing, the colorless, transparent phenyl meth acrylate is obtained. The following examples and comparative examples further illustrate the present invention but shall by no means limit the present invention to these embodiments. In the examples and comparative examples, parts and percentages are given by weight.Example 1 103 parts of methacrylic acidr 75 parts of phenol, 2.4 parts of boric acid, 1.9 parts of sulfuric acid and 170 parts of xylene are mixed together and the reaction is carried out at 1500C for 10 h while air is introduced and the dehydration is effected by xylene azeotropy. The resulting reaction liquid is washed three times with 300 parts of 1.5 N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and then distilled to obtain 94.7 parts yield 73 of colorless, transparent phenyl methacrylate. No polymerization occurred in the course of the reaction.

Only 16.7 parts of phenyl methacrylate are obtained yield 13 . According to the process of the present invention, a phenyl meth acrylate can be synthesized efficiently by subjecting meth acrylic acid and a compound having a phenolic hydroxyl group to a dehydration reaction at a temperature of at least 1100C in the presence of an acid catalyst. The process of the invention is quite advantageous for the production of the phenyl meth acrylate having excellent properties such as a high refractive index, low hygroscopicity and high thermal resistance on an industrial scale. According to this process, phenyl meth acrylate can be obtained at costs far lower than that required in the conventional process wherein meth acryloyl chloride is used as the starting material.
