# Bypassing double action rope grip.

## Abstract
A safety system 10 for protecting workers at high altitudes from falling to the ground is disclosed. The system features a rope grip 12 having a rotably mounted wedge 18 in spaced facing relationship with a retaining member 20 . The safety line 14 is jammed between the retaining member and the wedge. The rope grip is able to bypass an anchor 16 by virtue of the fact that the retaining member is held in place by rotating slotted wheels 44 and 46 .
