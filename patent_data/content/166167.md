## Description
The present invention relates to a process for fabricating a semiconductor device having p channel and n channel MISFETs that have good characteristics with regard to the threshold voltage V In MOS devices, there is a tendency to reduce the channel length. As a consequence, the electric field between the source region and the drain region is increased. Therefore, hot charriers are injected into the gate oxide film, deterioriating the characteristics of the device. To prevent this problem, it was proposed to reduce the electric field between the source region and the drain region by a lightly doped drain LDD construction see, for example, IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices ED 29 1982 No. 4, pages 590 to 596 . However, employment of the LDD structure makes it necessary to provide side walls and to effect ion implantation before and after the formation of the side walls, resulting in more manufacturing steps and higher manufacturing costs. Still more manufacturing steps are required when the LDD construction is adapted to CMOS devices. Ion implantation must be effected one more time on the p channel metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor P MOSFET and on the n channel metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor N MOSFET , respectively. Therefore, a photoresist mask must be formed two more times, compared with a conventional device not of LDD construction. The process is thus complicated in addition to the extra step for forming the side walls, and the manufacturing costs become expensive. Further, in such CMOS devices, the effective channel length becomes extremely short, so that the V In the IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices ED 31 1984 No. 2, pages 205 to 214, a CMOS device including MOSFETs with gate electrodes having sidewalls and an LDD structure only on the n channel side is shown. However, there is nothing disclosed on the material of these sidewalls and the fabrication process of the device and the role of the sidewalls therein. From the Patent Abstracts of Japan, Volume 7, No. 40 E 159 1185 , 1983 or the JP A 57 192063, respectively, there is known a process for reducing the number of photomask steps in producing CMOS devices. However, the gate electrodes thereof do not have side walls, and there is used an additional photoresist mask for implanting ions in high concentration. This photoresist mask has then to be removed. The object of the present invention is to provide a process for manufacturing a semiconductor device which exhibits good characteristics of threshold voltage V Starting from the above mentioned prior art described in the IEEE ED 31 paper, this object is solved by the features described in attached claim 1. In the subclaims, preferred embodiments are included. According to the invention, the source and drain regions are so formed that the junction of the semiconductor layer is positioned close to each end of the gate electrode so that the effective channel length can be increased even when the gate is short, and so that the MOS device shows good V Further, the source and drain regions are formed by implanting impurity ions after the side walls have been formed on both sides of the gate electrode. Therefore, CMOS devices can be manufactured through a simplified process and at reduced manufacturing costs. An example of the invention will be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figs. 1A to 1F are sectional views illustrating the steps for manufactoring CMOS devices according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 1A, first an n type well 3 is formed by a conventional method on an n type silicon semiconductor substrate 1, and then a p type well 2 is formed. The substrate 1 has an impurity concentration of 5 x 10¹⁴ cm³, the p type well 2 has an impurity concentration of 2 x 10¹⁶ cm³ with boron ions implanted and drive in diffused, and the n type well 3 has an impurity concentration of 4 x 10¹⁶ cm³ with phosphorus or arsenic ions implanted and drive in diffused. A p type single crystalline silicon having an impurity concentration of 1.5 x 10¹⁵ cm³ may be used as the substrate 1. As shown in Fig. 1A, furthermore, the substrate 1 is thermally oxidized to form a field oxide film 4 to define a region where the elements are to be formed. A p type channel stopper may be formed under the field oxide film 4 in the p type well 2. A thin gate oxide film 5 which is a silicon oxide film is formed by thermally oxidizing the substrate 1 on the region where the elements are to be formed. A polycrystalline silicon layer 7 is formed by the CVD method on the gate oxide film 5, and is doped with impurities such as phosphorus ions to a high concentration to reduce the resistance thereof. Then, a phosphosilicate glass PSG film 6 is formed thereon by the CVD method. Next, the PSG film 6 and the polycrystalline silicon layer 7 are subjected to etching patterning relying upon a conventional step of photolighography using a photoresist, in order to form a gate electrode 8 consisting of polycrystalline silicon layer 7 the upper surface of which, is masked with the PSG film 6. Then, as shown in Fig. 1B, a p MOSFET forming region region other than n MOSFET forming region is masked with a resist 14, and phosphorus ions are implanted into the n MOSFFT forming region at a dose of 1 x 10¹³ cm² and an energy of 60 KeV, to form a shallow ion implanted layer 15 of a low concentration. After the resist 14 is removed, annealing is effected to obtain an n type layer 15 having a surface concentration of about 1 x 10¹⁸ cm³. An SiO₂ film 16 is formed by the CVD method on the whole surface of the substrate as shown in Fig. 1C, and is then subjected to etching over the whole surface thereof by reactive ion etching RIE with CHF₃ gas. The SiO₂ film 16 is left as side walls 16a on both sides of the gate electrode 8. Referring to Fig. 1D, the p MOSFET forming region n type well 3 is masked with a resist 17 by photoetching, and arsenic ions are implanted onto the n MOSFET forming region p type well 2 at a dose of 7 x 10¹⁵ cm², and an energy of 100 KeV to form a deep ion implanted layer 18 of a high concentration. After the resist 17 is removed, an n type layer 18 is formed by annealing so as to have a surface concentration of 8 x 10²⁰ cm³. Thus, an n MOSFET of LDD construction having a source region 19 and a drain region 20 is formed in the p type well 2. Then, the whole surface except the n type well 3 is masked with a resist 21 as shown in Fig. 1E. With side walls 16a on the n type well 3 as masks, boron ions are implanted at a dose of 2 x 10¹⁵ cm² and an energy of 25 KeV to form a deep ion implanted layer 22 having a high concentration. After the resist 21 is removed, a p type layer 22 is formed by annealing to have a surface concentration of 3 x 10²⁰ cm³. Due to annealing, the junction of the p type layer 22 infiltrates into the under portion of the gate electrode 8 as shown in Fig. 1F, since boron ions have a high diffusion velocity. A source region 23 and a drain region 24 of a single diffused construction are thus formed having the effect of reducing the electric field intensity just like that of the LDD construction. As described above, the source and drain regions 19, 20 of the n MOSFET constituting the CMOS device comprise a shallow n type layer 15 and a deep n type layer 18 which is formed in an offset gate construction. Therefore, even when the channel is shortened, the electric field intensity between the source and the drain can be reduced, and characteristics can be prevented from being degraded by hot carriers. Therefore, an n MOSFET having a high breakdown voltage is formed. Further, by ion implantation after the side walls 16a have been formed, the source and drain regions 23, 24 of p MOSFET of the other side constituting the CMOS device are formed into a single p type layer 22 single drain construction , so that the junction at the end of the p type layer 22 will penetrate into the under portion of the gate electrode 8. Therefore, even if the gate length is reduced, the effective channel length can be increased provided the side walls 16a are very thick, making it possible to obtain a p MOSFET having good V According to the present invention as described above, there is obtained a p MOSFET having good V According to the CMOS device of the above mentioned embodiment, furthermore, the photolithography step that was required for the CMOS devices having p and n MOSFET s of LDD construction can be eliminated hence, manufacturing costs can be decreased. Furthermore, the CMOS device of the present invention contains a p MOSFET having good V In the present invention, the effects are obtained as mentioned below The above mentioned embodiment may be modified as follows In addition to a silicon oxide film, furthermore, the gate insulating film may be composed of any other insulating film silicon nitride film or a film of a combination thereof . The present invention can further be adapted to MIS metal insulated semiconductor FET s. Instead of the resist, furthermore, a silicon dioxide film or a silicon nitride film may be used as a masking material. Further, the side wall may be made of any other insulating material, such as silicon nitride or the like, or may be made of a combination of silicon dioxide film and silicon nitride film. The PSG film 6 need not necessarily be formed. Further, there may not be formed a well region having the same type of conductivity as the substrate. Here, the substrate may have either n type or p type conductivity. Instead of using a field oxide film, the element may be isolated by any other method, such as by burying an insulating material into grooves that are formed in the substrate by reactive ion etching RIE or the like. It is also allowable to form a thin silicide layer of platinum or a high melting metal on the surfaces of source and drain regions that are not covered by the side wall.
