## Description
The present invention relates to a novel and convenient method for preparing methotrexate, and to an important intermediate useful in the method. Methotrexate N 4 2, 4 diamino 6 pteridinyl methyl methylamino benzoyl glutamic acid is a well known antineoplastic agent useful in the treatment of acute leukemia and other cancerous diseases.In the past, methotrexate has been accepted in a rather impure state and with unspecified optical rotation cf. U.S.P. XIX, 1973 74, p. 315 and B.P. 1973, p. 300 .The synthesis of pure methotrexate is difficult because of the complexity of the molecule and because of the extreme insolubility of the pteridines. However, one known method has proved to be especially good for the preparation of methotrexate as the reactions involved in the method are easy, and as the reaction sequence gives very pure methotrexate, in particular free from its 7 isomer. This method called the Taylor method E.C. Taylor, Chemistry andBiology of Pteridines, Proceedings of the 5th International Symposium,Konstanz, 1975, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, 1975, pp. 543 573 is illustrated in the following reaction sequence EMI1.1 EMI2.1 Unfortunately, the reaction of optically active III with guanidine to form IV results in complete racemisation of the side chain the glutamic acid moiety .In J. Org. Chem. 40, 3447 3448 1975 , H.G. Mautner and Young HoKim deal with the synthesis of analogues of folic acid through the cyclisation of substituted 2 amino 3 cyano pyrazines and state that the problem of side chain racemisation during the guanidine cyclisation cannot be ignored since it affects the biological interactions of the products. The authors mention that the racemisation problem in synthesising folic acid analogues by use of the Taylor synthesis can be avoided by carrying out the cyclisation at the pteroic acid level and then forming the amide carrying the optically active substituent.However, the attempt to solve the problem in that way would itself constitute a basically different route from the Taylor method .The present invention relates to a novel method for preparing methotrexate in which the problem of side chain racemisation is solved, with retention of the important advantages of the Taylor Method .The method of the present invention for preparing methotrexate comprises reacting N 4 2 amino 3 cyano 5 pyrazinyl methyl me thylamino benzoyl glutamic acid with guanidine or a guanidine salt of a weak inorganic or organic acid. It has surprisingly been found that when N 4 2 amino 3 cyano 5 pyrazinyl methyl methylamino benzoyl glutamic acid in L , D,L or D form is reacted with guanidine or a guanidine salt of a weak inorganic or organic acid, the resulting methotrexate has the same optical form as the corresponding starting material.The guanidine salt of a weak inorganic or organic acid may, for example, be guanidine carbonate or guanidine acetate. The reaction of the N 4 2 amino 3 cyano 5 pyrazinyl methyl methylamino benz oylglutamic acid with guanidine or a guanidine salt of a weak inorganic or organic acid is preferably performed in dimethyl sulfoxide at a temperature of about 100 C. The resulting methotrexate may be obtained, e.g., by pouring the reaction mixture into water at pH 4 and separating the methotrexate by filtration. The methotrexate is obtained in high yield. A conventional acid base purification gives methotrexate of good purity.It should be noted that in order to avoid change of the optical form during the reaction with guanidine, the N 4 2 amino 3 cyano 5 pyrazinyl methyl methylamino benzoyl glutamic acid should be free from any content of the corresponding diester. On the other hand, it has been found that the N 4 2 amino 3 cyano 5 pyrazinyl me thyl methylamino benzoyl glutamic acid can contain the monoester half ester in any amount without affecting the yield or the optical form. Any such content of monoester will be found in the reaction product as the monoester of methotrexate which is then easily hydrolysed during the acid base purification step.Therefore, a modification of the above mentioned method of the invention is to use, instead of or, in combination with, the N 4 2 amino 3 cyano 5 pyrazinyl methyl methylamino benzoyl glutamic acid, the corresponding monoester, in particular the corresponding monoethylester.As indicated above, the N 4 2 amino 3 cyano 5 pyrazinyl methyl methylamino benzoyl glutamic acid may be either the L form, the D ,L form or the D form, and the methotrexate obtained in the process will correspondingly be L , D,L or D methotrexate. In view of the established clinical utility of the L form, this is the preferred form prepared by the method of the invention, but the D,L and the D forms are contemplated also to be useful in the same field as the L form.The N 4 2 amino 3 cyano 5 pyrazinyl methyl methylamino benzo yl glutamic acid is believed to be a novel compound and, as such, constitutes an aspect of the present invention. Also the monoesters, for example the monoethyl ester thereof, are believed to be novel and constitute valuable compounds of the present invention.According to the invention, the N 4 2 amino 3 cyano 5 pyrazinyl methyl methylamino benzoyl glutamic acid may be prepared by alkylation of N 4 methylamino benzoyl glutamic acid or a salt thereof with 2 amino 3 cyano 5 halomethylpyrazine, in particular 2 amino 3 cyano 5 chloromethylpyrazine. In this way, the N 4 2 amino 3 cyano 5 pyrazinyl methyl methylamino b enzoyl glutamic acid is obtained in good yield and in the same optical form as the corresponding N 4 methylamino b enzoyl glutamic acid. This reaction is preferably conducted in a mixture of water and organic solvent such as methanol, tetrahydrofuran, or acetonitrile, at a pH between 5 and 11.When the starting compound is prepared in this manner, the reaction sequence leading to methotrexate can be illustrated as follows EMI4.1 EMI5.1 N 4 Methylaminq benzoyl glutamic acid is a known compound, vide, e.g., S. C. J. Fu and Marion Reiner, J. Org. Chem. 30, p. 1277 1965 . Another method for preparing the N 4 2 amino 3 cyano 5 pyrazin yl methyl methylamino benzoyl glutamic acid in the L , D,L or D form comprises hydrolysing N 4 2 amino 3 cyano 5 pyrazinyl methyl me thylamino benzoyl glutamic acid diethylester in the L , D,L or D form. This hydrolysis should be conducted with care because of the reactive nitrile group in position 3 of the pyrazine ring. The hydrolysis is preferably performed at or below room temperature in a mixture of water and an organic solvent, for example acetonitrile.When the starting compound is prepared in this manner, the complete synthesis of methotrexate can be illustrated as follows EMI5.2 Irrespective of in which way the starting compound is prepared, the method of the present invention results in a good yield of methotrexate which is in the same optical form as the corresponding starting material and of good purity.U.S. Patent No. 4,057,548 claims the preparation of a compound having the formulaEMI6.1 wherein R is hydrogen or a lower alkyl group and R is hydrogen or methyl, by treating a compound having a formulaEMI6.2 wherein R is hydrogen or a lower alkyl group and R is hydrogen or methyl, with a guanidine salt of a weak organic acid. The patent, however, does not disclose N 4 2 amino 3 cyano 5 pyrazinyl methyl methylamino benzoyl glutamic acid and, in particular, does not disclose or indicate the preparation of optically active methotrexate by reacting optically active N 4 2 amino 3 cyano 5 pyrazinyl methyl methylamino benzoyl glutamic acid with guanidine or a guanidine salt of a weak organic acid.The only example of the preparation of methotrexate given in the patent utilizes the diethylester of N 4 2 amino 3 cyano 5 pyrazinyl methyl methylamino benzoyl glutamic acid and states that the resulting methotrexate is completely racemic.It will be evident to the skilled art worker that the principles of this invention can easily be applied to the production of related compounds, e.g. folic acid which may be produced as illustrated in the below reaction scheme.EMI7.1 The compound X may also be prepared by hydrolysing a compound of the general formula XIIEMI8.1 In the above scheme, R1 is hydrogen or lower alkyl, and R2 is lower alkyl.A lower alkyl group R1 or R2 is a straight or branched alkyl group having 1 6, preferably 1 4, carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl and isobutyl, sec.butyl or tert.butyl.The invention is further illustrated by the following examples.Example 1.N 4 2 Amino 3 cyano 5 pyrazinyl methyl methylamino benzoyl L glutamic acid VII .3.4 g 0.02 mol 2 amino 3 cyano 5 chloromethylpyrazine I , 6.5 g 0.02 mol sodium N 4 methylamino benzoyl L glutamate VI and 2.8 g 0.02 mol potassium carbonate were reacted in a mixture of acetonitrile 100 ml and water 100 ml for 3 hours at 17 C. 10 g of sodium chloride was added and the reaction mixture was extracted once with ethyl acetate.
