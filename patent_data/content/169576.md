# Method and system of circuit pattern understanding and layout.

## Abstract
This invention features that the structure of a circuit which is given basic net data is stored as a pattern, the compliance of the basic net data with the pattern is checked by the separately prepared search function, and upon fulfillment of compliance the pattern is determined to exist within the circuit. The invention does not directly define a subcircuit to be recognized by elements, but defines it using an intermediate expression defined recursively so as to implement a search through pattern matching. In this case, elements are terminal symbols dealed with in the formal language theory and the intermediate expression is a set of nonterminal symbol. In another form of this invention, one input terminal is specified, which is followed by the search for blocks having the terminal as an input node and the search for blocks having one of the output node string as an input node recursively and cyclically until the output terminal is reached, so as to extract a string of nodes on which the signal is propagated. The system is provided with functions for recognizing and comprehending subsidiary structures of the circuit which are not defined on the entered net data. By the combinational use of the recognition result and the layout shape generating function prepared separately, the layout shape of the subsidiary structures are determined. Shapes of objects determined through the above process are laid out automatically, while avoiding obstacles, within a predeter mined space. According to still another form of this invention, layout patterns of variable structure memorizing the object layout and wiring affair are prepared in advance, and a layout plan for a circuit having a hierarchical structure is created through the operation of embeding the circuit to be laid out into a pattern. In order to achieve the above object, this invention features that local variables of the processing logic language are made to have data in tree structure, so that information in the tree structure is retrieved in response to the externally issued retrieved in response to the externally issued retriev ing key words and A.O.V.
