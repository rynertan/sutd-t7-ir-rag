# DIRECT CURRENT BLOCKING CIRCUIT AND IMPLANTABLE DEVICE USING SAME

## Abstract
A direct current blocking circuit 18 adapted for use with an electrical load 14 . First 12 and second 20 block ing devices are coupled in series with each other and in series with the electrical load 14 for substantially blocking the passage of direct current through the load 14 . A shunt device 22 is coupled in parallel with the load 14 and coupled between the first 12 and second 20 blocking devices for shunting a portion of the direct current leaking through the first blocking device 12 . In this manner. the load 14 is protected against the passage of direct current not only by the first blocking device 12 and the second blocking device 20 but also by the limited voltage ap pearing across the shunt device 22 . Also provided is an implantable device for stimulating body tissue which utilizes the DC blocking circuit 18 described above.
