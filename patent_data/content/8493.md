# Delayed coking process with hydrotreated recycle and graphitized products thereof.

## Abstract
A delayed coking process in which a liquid hydrocar bonaceous feedstock is heated in a coker furnace 13 and then fed to a delayed coking drum 15 , and in which overhead vapors from said coking drum are passed to a coker frac tionator 11 where they are separated into light hydrocarbon products and recycle gas oil, and in which said recycle gas oil is combined with said feedstock and returned to said coking drum 15 , is characterised in that said recycle gas oil is hyd rotreated 20 after being separated from said light hydrocar bon products and prior to being combined with said feeds tock, whereby the resulting delayed coke is a premium coke, having a particularly low coefficient of thermal expression. The premium coke product may be graphitised and formed into shaped articles.
