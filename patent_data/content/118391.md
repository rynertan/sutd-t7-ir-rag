# Thermal cracking process for producing olefins from hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
A thermal cracking process for producing olefins 17 from hydrocarbons 17 which comprises the steps of burning hydrocarbon fuel 1 with less than the theoretical amount of oxygen 3 in the presence of steam 5 to give a hot gas 6 of from 1400 to 3000 C comprising steam and hydrogen prior to reaction feeding, to the hot gas 6 comprising the steam and hydrogen, a mixture of methane and hydrogen 30 so that a methane hydrogen molar ration is over 0.05 further feeding a starting hydrocarbon 7 to the hot gas mixture comprising the methane, hydrogen and steam subjecting the starting hydrocarbon to thermal cracking 8 while keeping the partial pressure of hydrogen at least 0.1 bar at the outlet of a reactor, the temperature at 800 to 1200 C, and the residence time at 5 to 300 milliseconds and quenching the resulting reaction product 10 .
