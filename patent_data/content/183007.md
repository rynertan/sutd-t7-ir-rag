# Port bushings for internally manifolded stacked, finned plate heat exchanger.

## Abstract
Internal plates 10, 11, 12 for a finned plate, plate stack heat exchanger 50 are formed with manifold areas 32, 33 one at each opposite end. Ports 22, 24, 26, 28 are excised through each plate in the manifold areas, two ports at each end. A pair of compressible, fluid impervious bushings 34 are inserted in two diagonally opposed ports, e.g. 22, 28 or 24, 26, in each plate and extend upwards to make fluid impervious contact with the bottom surface of the plate immediately above. Thus, fluid can flow through the bushings between a first and a third plate without leaking onto the second plate which is located between the first and third plates. The interior plates 10, 11 and 12 of the exchanger 50 are rotatable 180 without altering the mating orientation of the ports of any two adjacent interior plates, e.g., 10 and 12.

## Description
PORT BUSHINGS FOR INTERNALLY MANIFOLDED STACKED, FINNED PLATE HEAT EXCHANGER Backqround of the Invention 1. Field of the Invention Thins invention relates to plate stack heat exchangers and especially to plate stack heat exchangers with internal manifolding. 2. Description of the Prior Art Finned plate heat exchangers are malnly of the channel and rlb type construction. Countercurrent flow can be achieved however, manifolding a plate stack which must separate the fluids at entry and exist becomes extremely complex. Since the manifolding of the crosscurrent heat exchangers is comparatively simple, this heat exchanger system is more widely used although it is less efficient than the countercurrent system and it induces serous thermal and mechanical stresses. One crosscurrent system which has attempted to solve the manifolding problem of the countercurrent heat exchanger is taught byCampbell et al, U.S. Patent No. 3,305,010. Campbell et al teach a heat exchanger having superposed stacked plate and fln elements and complex nanifolding means for introducing fluids of different temperatures into opposite ends of the assembly. However, Campbell et al do not teach a plate which serves as both the plate and the fln, nor does Campbell et al teach means for internally manifolding the plate swithin the plate s plane. One of the problems in the stacked plate type of heat exchanger is the blocking of a selected internal port at any stack level to prevent fluld flow from the selected port through the channels on that level and, thus, to force the fluid through the port to the next level where it is permitted to flow through the channels.Objects of the Invention An object of the present invention is to provide a finned plate for an internally manifolded plate stack heat exchanger. Another ob3ect is to provide a simple means for blocking the flow from a fluid inlet port at a given plate level in a plate stack heat exchanger and for passing that fluld through to a fluld lnlet port in the next higher plate. Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawlng. Summary of the Invention The invention comprises an internally man1folded. countercurrent, finned plate stack heat exchanger, each interior plate having manifold areas at opposite ends thereof. Flow, or fluid entry, ports are excised through the plates, at least two at each manifold area. The ports and the flans are formed so that the plates can be rotated 1800 without the relative overall appearance belng changed, l.e., the ports of the rotated plate will still be in matting position wlth the ports of an unrotated plate when the two plates are stacked.Bushings of compressible, fluid impervious material are inserted into two diagonally opposite ports in each plate and a gasket is inserted in a groove in the upper surface of the peripheral wall around the plate so that fluld does not flow between the contracting surfaces of the gasket and bushing wlth the bottom surface of the plate immediately above.

Fig. 4 is a schematic diagram illustrating a unitary form of construction for the wall and bushing gaskets. The same elements or parts throughout the figures of the drawing are designated by the same reference characters, while equivalent elements bear a prime designation.Detailed Descr1otlon of the Invention Fig. 1 shows a schematic view of two interior, adjacent, finned channel plates 10 and 12 for a heat exchanger 50 Figure 3 in accordance with the present invention. The lower and upper plates 10 and 12 are preferably rectangular and are formed with parallel, longitudinal, upstanding fins 16 which define longitudinal channels 18 between them. The plates may be formed of metal by an extrusion process and areas 20 and 21 see Flg. 2 can be formed later where the fins 16 are milled off at each end.A palr of spaced fluid entry ports 22 and 24 are trilled at one end toward the corners of the plates, and another palr of ports 26 and 28 are dried similarly at the other end. A frame 30 is placed upon and bonded to the periphery of the upper surface of each finned plate, thus forming a wall 31 around the plate and a well or manifold 32, 33 at each end where the fins 16 were milled off. Two dlagonally opposite ports on each plate are fitted witch a bushing insert 34 which extends upwards as far as the top of the wall 31 of the frame 30 and the tops of the fins 16, the top surfaces of these members forming a flat plane. The bushings 34 are preferably formed from a compressible material, such as a heat reslstant elastomer, in which case they may extend slightly above the aforementioned flat plane, or may be formed from a petal with a groove in the upper surface in which a circular gasket 36, or O rtng, can be inserted.The frame 30 is also preferably formed witch a groove tn its upper surface in which a gasket 38 is inserted. The bottom surface of the interior plates 10 and 12, as well as that of the top plate 14, must be flat surfaces so that they make good contact with the gaskets 38 and 36 on the frames 30 and bushings 34 of the plates underneath the surfaces. The gaskets 36 and 38, of course, prevent the passage of fluids. The bottom plate 10 see Fig. 3 in the stack of plates is formed somewhat differently from the interior plates 10, 12, etc. The bottom plate 10 is formed with only two ports 24 and 28 , each in a different manifold area and each on the same longitudinal sidle of the plate, One port 24 is the entry port for one fluid B , e.g., cool air, and the other port 28 is the entry port for a second fluid A , e.g., hot oil which is to be cooled.A bushing 34 is inserted through the entry port 24 for the fluld whlch is not to be circulated through the channels 18 tn the bottom plate 10 thereby transforming this port into a non dispersive port, 1.e., a port through which the fluld flows only to the next plate 12 above the bottom plate 10 . The arrows indicate the direction of the fluid flows. Thus, pressurized fluid A enters the bottom plate 10 through inlet port 28 , fills the manifold 33 and a portlon proceeds through the channels 18 between the fins 16 and up through the inlet port 22 in the second plate 12. A second portlon proceeds directly through the non dispersive port 28 in the second plate 12 through the inlet port 28 in the third plate 10 where it provides the source of fluid flow to the left as in the first plate. Pressurized fluid B enters the bottom plate 10 through non dispersive port 24 and is prevented from flowing in the bottom plate 10 by the bushing 34. Fluid B goes through the inlet port 24 tn the second plate 12 and fills the manifold 32 on the left side. A portlon of the manifold fluld flows to the right through the channels 18 and then up through non dispersive port 26 in plate 10 and port 26 tn plate 11. It leaves the plate stack through the outlet duct 42 tn the top plate 14 which is formed with two outlet ducts, 42 for fluid B and 40 for fluid A. Fluid B always flows to the right in alternate plates, e.g., plates 12 and 11. For fluid B, the ports 24 and 24 in each plate are inlet ports and the ports 26 diagonally opposite are outlet ports.For fluid A, the ports 28 and 28 are inlet ports and the ports 22 are outlet ports. The flows in the channels 18 for fluld A and B are counterflows. It should be noted that many more interior plates are present even though omitted in the drawing. All interior plates 10, 11, 12 have the same construction although any two adJacent plates are rotated by 1800 from each other. Plate 10 may differ only in the omission of a port 26. In Fig. 4, there is shown a unitary form of constructlon for a gasket 62 which may be inserted in a groove along the top of the peripheral wall and the circular gaskets 60 which may be put on the top of the bushings 34. Obviousl, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that, within the scope of the appended clalms, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
