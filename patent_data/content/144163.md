# Method for pressing a composite assembly.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a process of forming an extended elongate product from a plurality of strands 24, 24 by subjecting the strands to heat and pressure. The improvement of the present invention comprises a method for compressing the strands 24, 24 in a manner to reduce internal stresses imparted to the product during its subjec tion to pressure. The method includes the steps of a transporting in a longitudinal direction the strands 24, 24 in a generally parallel and overlapping relationship through a compressing zone of a press assembly 10, 10 , 10 b increasing the pressure on the strands 24, 24 as they pass from an inlet end to an outlet end of the compressing zone by gradually converging facing walls 20, 20 , 20 , 22, 22 , 22 of the press assembly so that i the strands 24, 24 being compressed move relative to one another through at least a portion of the compressing zone and ii the strands 24, 24 being compressed, lock up so that they no longer move relative to one another but rather only compress relative to one another at a point A in the compressing zone where the radius of curvature R2 in the longitudinal direction on either side of a central reference plane 26, 26 , 26 of the mat being compressed is at least about 30 feet to provide a low remembered internal stress.
