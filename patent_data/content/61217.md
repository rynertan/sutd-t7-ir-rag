# IBUPROFEN CONTAINING SUSTAINED RELEASE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION

## Abstract
The invention relates to an ibuprofen containing sus tained release pharmaceutical composition, comprising spheroids consisting of three components, namely a central core or microgranule of inert excipient, a layer of active principle applied on said central core, and an outer coating of active excipient forming the sustained release membrane. With this composition a remarkable reduction of the release rate is obtained in comparison with the known administra tion forms, reproducible results are obtained as release patterns of the active principle versus time and possible side effects are avoided.
