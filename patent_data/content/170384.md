# POLYMERIZATION CATALYST

## Abstract
An olefin polymerization catalyst produced by treating an inert support material, preferably a hydrated high surface area silica support having 1.00 to 1.50 hydroxyls per gram of silica with the reaction product of an organomagnesium compound and first a zirconium compound then a halogena tor and tetravalent titanium compound, which when used as a cocatalyst with an organoaluminum compound produces polymers having braod molecular weight distribution.
