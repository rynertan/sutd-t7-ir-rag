## Description
Novel DNA and Use Thereof This invention relates to a recombinant DNA and use thereof. More particularly, this invention relates to a recombinant DNA containing the structural gene for human immune interferon downstream from a rec A promoter or promoters and use hereof. Interferons hereinafter sometimes abbreviated as IFN are proteins produced by cells of higher animals in response to the stimulation with a virus, nucleic acid, etc., and have antiviral, antitumor and other activities. Three types of human IFN are now known, namely alpha, beta and gamma types hereinafter sometimes abbreviated as IFN a , IFN and 1IFN y , respectively . The alpha and beta types are induced by a virus or nucleic acid and the gamma type is induced by mitogens, among others, IFN y is also called immune interferon I IFN and said to have higher antiproliferative and antitumor activities as compared with IFN a and IFN B and therefore is more promising from the viewpoint of clinical application. Recently, by making use of gene manipulation techniques, cDNAs complementary to mRNAs isolated from humanIFN y secreting cells such as peripheral blood lymphocytes were synthesized. Such human IFN y encoding cDNAs were cloned, their base sequences were determined and the amino acid sequence of human IFN y was estimated on the basis of said base sequences. It was thus revealed that the human IFN y gene is composed of a region for a signal peptide containing 20 amino acids and a region coding for the IFN polypeptide containing 146 amino acids Gray, P. W. et al.,Nature, 295, 503 509 1982 Devos, R. et al., NucleicAcids Research, 10, 2487 2501 1982 Derynck, R. et al.,Nucleic Acids Research, 10, 3605 3615 1982 1.The results of these studies indicate that there are two structural genes for IFN y, one for the IFN y polypeptide containingArg as the 140th amino acid Devos et al., vide supra and the other for the IFN y polypeptide containing Gln as the 140th amino acid Gray et al. and Derynck et al., vide supra . Furthermore, a DNA equivalent in gene function to the structural gene for the IFN y polypeptide the 140th amino acid being Arg was prepared by chemical synthesis Tanaka,S. et al., Nucleic Acids Research Symposium Series No. 11, 29 32 1982 1. The expression of these genes was attempted successfully in monkey cells Gray et al. and Devos et al., vide supra , E. coli Gray et al., vide supra Goeddel,D., Abstracts of 4th International Symposium on Genetics ofIndustrial Microorganisms Kyoto , p. 30 1982 Tanaka et al., vide supral and yeast Goeddel, vide supral. However, in each case, the productivity is not so high as to enable large scale production. The present inventors energetically endeavored to realize efficient expression of the IFN y gene inEscherichia coli and found that said gene can be expressed efficiently when a rec A promoter is utilized, and continued research has now led to the present invention.Thus, the present invention provides a novel method of producing human IFN y utilizing a rec A promoter or promoters. The DNA to be used in the present invention may be any human IFN y polypeptide encoding one, for instance a complementary DNA cDNA synthesized on the basis of mRNA, a genomic DNA, a chemically synthesized DNA or a DNA constructed by adequately combining these. More specifically, there may be mentioned a DNA isolated and identified by the present inventors and containing the base sequence of the formula 5 TGT TAC TGC CAG GAC OCA TAT GTA AAA GAA GCA GAA AACCTT AAG AAA TAT TTT AAT GCA GGT CAT TCA GAT GTA GCG GATAAT GGA ACT CTT TTC TTA GGC ATT TTG AAG AAT TGG AAA GAGGAG AGT GAC AGA AAA ATA ATG CAG AGC CAA ATT GTC TCC TTTTAC TTC AAA CTT TTT AAA AAC TTT AAA GAT GAC CAG AGC ATCCAA AAG AGT GTG GAG ACC ATC AAG GAA GAC ATG AAT GTC AAGTTT TTC AAT AGC AAC AAA AAG AAA OGA GAT GAC TTC GAA AAGCTG ACT AAT TAT TCG GTA ACT GAC TTG AAT GTC CAA OGO AAAGCA ATA CAT GAA CTC ATC CAA GTG ATG GCT GAA CTG TCG OCA GCA GCT AAA ACA GGG AAG OGA AAA AGG AGT CAG ATG CTG TTT 140 146 OGA GGT OGA AGA GCA TCC CAG X 3 I wherein X is TAA, TGA or TAG refer to European PatentPublication No. 0089676 claiming the priority of PCT JP82 00080J.

The above DNA I may have ATG III at the 5 end thereof. When the DNA I has ATG of formula III at the 5l end thereof, it codes not only for the polypeptide II but also the polypeptide having Met added to the N terminus of II or a polypeptide equivalent to these in activities. Such DNA can be prepared in. the following manner.Human IFN y secreting cells, such as human peripheral blood lymphocytes are cultivated and the human IFN y polypeptideencoding mRNA is isolated from the culture by the known method. Using the thus obtained mRNA as the template, a DNA chain is synthesized by the per se known method using a reverse transcriptase, for instance, and the cDNA is converted to the double stranded form Maniatis, T. et al.,Cell, 8, 163 182 1976 1. This double stranded DNA is inserted, for example, into the plasmid pBR322 at the PstI or SphI restriction endonuclease cleavage site, for example, by the dG dC or dA dT homopolymer tailing method Nelson, T. S., Methods in Enzymology, 68, 41 50 1979 , Academic Press Inc., NewYork. The recombinant plasmid is then introduced, for example, into Escherichia coli X 1776, by transformation. The desired transformants can be selected as the tetracycline resistant or ampicillin resistant colonies.Separately, an oligonucleotide having a base sequence supposedly corresponding to the amino acid sequence of the IFN y polypeptide is synthesized chemically and then labeled with 32p Using the labeled oligonucleotide as the probe, the desired clones are secondarily screened out from among the already obtained tetracycline or ampicillinresistant transformants by the per se known colony hybridization method tGrunstein, M. and Hogness, D. S., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 72, 3961 3965 1975 1, for instance. For confirming the presence of the IFN y gene, the base sequence of the clones showing the positive colony hybridization result is determined, for example, by the Maxam Gilbert method Maxam, A. M. and Gilbert, W., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 74, 560 564 1977 or the dideoxynucleotide synthetic chain termination method messing, J.et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 9, 309 321 1981 . Thereafter, the whole or part of.the IFN y gene is excised from the clones obtained. Furthermore, the DNA containing the base sequence of the formula 1 10 TGC TAC TGC CAG GAC CCA TAC GTG AAG GAA GCT GAA AAC 20CTG AAG AAA TAC TTC AAC GCT GGT CAT TCT GAC GTT GCT GAC 30 40AAC GGT ACT CTG TTC CTG GGT ATC CTG AAA AAC TGG AAA GAA 50GAA TCT GAC CGT AAA ATC ATG CAG TCT CAG ATC GTT TCT TTC 60TAC TTC AAG CTG TTC AAA AAC TTC AAG GAC GAC CAG TCT ATC 70 80CAG AAA TCT GTT GAA ACT ATC AAG GAA GAC ATG AAC GTT AAG 90TTC TTC AAC TCT AAC AAG AAA AAG CGT GAC GAC TTC GAA AAG 100 110CTT ACT AAC TAC TCT GTT ACT GAC CTT AAT GTA CAG CGT AAA 120 RTI ID 5.17 GCT ATC CAT GAA CTG ATC CAG GTT ATG GCT GAA CTG TCC CCG 130 GCT GCT AAA ACT GGT AAG CGT AAA AGA TCT CAG ATG CTG TTC 140 146GGT GGT CGT CGT GCT TCT CAG chemically synthesized by Tanaka, S. et al vide supra can also be used as the gene for the production of IFN gamma . It is a known phenomenon that when, as a result of the expression of a certain foreign gene, the relevant protein is accumulated in a large amount, the growth of the host cells is inhibited and further the death of the cells may be caused. In order to avoid such phenomenon, it is desirable, if possible, to grow the cells in the condition in which the gene expression is suppressed and thereafter place the cells under adequate conditions for inducing the gene expression. The Escherichia coli rec A promoter is a promoter which controls the synthesis of the rec A gene product. The rec A gene plays a main role in the so called SOS response Witkin, E. M., Bacteriol. Reviews, 40, 869 907 1976 J which involves the induced synthesis of its product and the repair of damaged DNA upon damage of DNA in cells or upon inhibition of replication. Its product rec A protein has protease activity. Since the lex A gene product acts as the rec A gene repressor, the expression of the rec A gene is normally suppressed. However, a DNAdamaging treatment, such as W irradiation, nalidixic acid treatment or mitomycin treatment, strongly induces the synthesis of the rec A protein. This indicates that the rec A promoter is activated by such treatment. Therefore, the recombinant DNA in accordance with the present invention with the human IFN y structural gene inserted downstream from the rec A promoter can be controlled as well, with respect to the synthesis of its product, by the above treatment. This property is very advantageous for the production of the human IFN y protein. The fact that the promoter activity is very strong further increases the utility of the present invention. The base sequence of the rec A promoter has already been reported taorii, T. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.USA, 77, 313 317 1980 Sancar, A. et al., ibid., 77, 2611 2615 1980 1. However, there is no adequate restriction enzyme cleavage site downstream from the rec A promoter. Accordingly, it cannot be said to be advantageous to insert the structural gene downstream from the recA promoter as it is. Since there is no restriction enzyme recognition site immediately following the rec A promoter, the ligation of the structural gene would unavoidably result only in the production of a chimera peptide of the rec A protein with the structure gene product.The present inventors newly prepared the rec A promoter, introduced various restriction enzyme recognition sites on both ends thereof, inserted the human IFN y structural gene downstream therefrom, and succeeded in reconstructing the promoter such that the intended human IFN y structural gene can be expressed directly, not in the form of a chimera peptide between the rec A protein and the structural gene product. Thus, the present invention also discloses, as a preferred embodiment thereof, a recombinant DNA which does not contain any other translational initiation codon than that for a human IFN y structural gene between the rec A promoter and said gene.

Double digestion of the plasmid pMCR611 DNA containing the rec A promoter inserted therein Miki, T. et al.,Mol. Gen. Genet., 183, 25 31 1981 1 with the restriction enzymes BamHI and PstI gives a 1.25 Kb DNA fragment containing the rec A promoter. Digestion of said fragment with the restriction enzyme HaeIII gives a 300 b DNA fragment containing the rec A promoter. Further digestion of this 300 b DNA fragment with the restriction enzyme HpaII gives a 148 b DNA fragment covering, according to the report ofSancar et al. vide supra , the sequence from 129 to 19 with the RNA transcription startpoint on the rec A promoter being counted as 1. The SD sequence of the rec A promoter is missing in said DNA fragment. Separately, oligonucleotides dCGGTATTACCCGGC, dATGACAGGAGTAAAAG, dTCATGOCGGGTAATAC and 6tGATCCTTTTACTCCTG are chemically synthesized, for example, by the phosphotriester method Crea, R. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 75, 5765 5769 1978 J. These are ligated together, for example, using T4 DNA ligase. The thus obtained 30 b DNA fragment is joined to the above 148 b DNA, for example with T4 DNA ligase, to give a 178 b DNA fragment. The cohesive termini on both ends of this DNA are filled in, for example with DNA polymerase I large fragment and then the BamHI linker dCCGGATCCGG is joined to said DNA usingT4 DNA ligase.The resulting DNA fragment is digested with the restriction enzyme BamHI and then inserted into the plasmid pBR322 digested with the same enzyme BamHI with the use of T4 DNA ligase. In this way, there can be constructed a recombinant plasmid, pREC3, which contains the rec A promoter possessing BamHI recognition sites on the ends thereof. An expression plasmid, pREC33, which possesses a BamHI site only downstream from the rec A promoter, can also be constructed by eliminating another BamHI site, which lies upstream from the rec A promoter, from said pREC3, for example by a series of operational steps, for example, partial digestion of pREC3 with BamHI, repair of the cohesive termini with DNA polymerase I large fragment and rejoining with T4 DNA ligase. It is also possible to cut out the rec A promoter of pREC3 with the restriction enzyme BamHI, render the cohesive termini on both ends blunt with S1 nuclease, DNA polymerase I large fragment or the like and join thereto the EcoRI, ClaI or HindIII linker, for instance, whereby a DNA possessing a restriction enzyme recognition site suitable for the insertion of the structural gene into said site, which lies downstream from said promoter, can be added to the end of the promoter. Furthermore, it is also possible, for example, to cut out, with a restriction enzyme, the rec A promoter of pREC3 or corresponding plasmids with the recognition sites at the ends of the promoter region being modified, ligate molecules of the cut out promoter with each other with T4DNA ligase and insert the thus obtained successive dimer, trimer, etc. containing a plurality of rec A promoters into the plasmid pBR322, whereby an expression plasmid having still more potent promoter activity can be obtained. In this case, it is preferable that there is no translational initiation codon between or among the rec A promoters. Any IFN y structural gene mentioned above can be inserted, with the aid of a restriction enzyme and T4 DNA ligase, into the expression vector constructed in the above manner. More concretely stating, a recombinant DNA containing a structural gene of human immune interferon downstream from a rec A promoter or promoters can be produced, for example, by combining a rec A promoter or promoters with a structural gene of human immune interferon downstream from said promoter or promoters in a plasmid. Preferably, a recombinant DNA of the present invention can be produced by inserting a structural gene of human immune interferon downstream from a rec A promoter or promoters, by inserting a rec A promoter or promoters upstream from a structural gene of human immune interferon, or by inserting a rec A promoter or promoters upstream from a rec A promoter or promoters of the above obtained recombinant DNA in a plasmid. The above expression plasmid or a recombinant DNA obtained by insertion of a structural gene for INF y thereinto can be introduced into an adequate host. The host includes microorganisms such as Escherichia coli,Bacillus subtilis and yeasts. Preferred are strains ofEscherichia coli strains 294, W3110, RR1, DM511, DM1187, etc. , in particular strain 294. The DM511 strain containing mutation in the lex A gene which is the repressor against the rec A promoter SIount, D. W. et al., J.Bacteriol., 116, 950 956 1973 and the DM1187 strain Mount, D. W., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 74, 300 304 1977 1 are also suitable for the development of activity by the present promoter. The strain 294 is a known strain Backman, K. et al.,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 73, 4174 4178 1976 . It is deposited at Institute for Fermentation, Osaka underNo. IFO l417l. The transformation of a host with the above recombinant DNA can be carried out by the known method Cohen, S. N. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 69, 2110 2114 1972 or a modification thereof. The thus obtained transformant is cultivated in a known medium, such as M9 medium containing glucose and casamino acids Miller, J., Experiments in MolecularGenetics, 431 433 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York 1972 . For efficient functioning of the promoter, in other words for suppressing the inhibition of the rec A gene expression, such an agent as mitomycin C or nalidixic acid may be added or ultraviolet irradiation may be made as necessary in carrying out the cultivation. The cultivation is conducted generally at 150 to 430C for 3 to 24 hours. Aeration and or stirring may be made as necessary.After cultivation, cells are harvested by the known method, then suspended for example in a buffer solution, and destructed for example by treatment with ultrasonic waves or an enzyme such as lysozyme. The supernatant is collected by the known method, such as centrifugation. The content of YFN y in said supernatant can be determined for antiviral activity by the cytopathic effect inhibition using vesicular stomatitis virus VSV on human amnion derived WISH cells Stewart, W. E., The InterferonSystem, 11 26 Springer Verlag, New York , 1979 . For isolating human IFN y from such IFN y containing supernatant, there may be used any of generally known methods of purifying proteins. In particular, the purification method using an antibody capable of binding to human IFN y is advantageous. Thus, for example, the purification can advantageously be effected by using a monoclonal antibody against the peptide H Lys Arg Lys Arg Ser Gln Met Leu Phe Arg Gly Arg Arg Ala Ser Gln OH Said monoclonal antibody can advantageously be used in the form of an antibody column. The antibody column can be prepared by coupling the above mentioned monoclonal antibody purely isolated from hybridoma inoculated ascites, for instance, to an adequate carrier, in the manner such as mentioned below. The carrier to be used may be any of those which, after coupling, can adsorb IFN y selectively and efficiently and thereafter allows adequate elution of IFN y.For example, agarose gel beads activated such that the primary amino group of proteins can easily be bound thereto, such as AFFI GEL 10 Bio Rad Lab., USA can be favorably used in the following manner. The reaction of AFFI GEL L 10 with the antibody is carried out in a buffer solution, such as 0.001 1 M, preferably 0.1 M, bicarbonate. Usable reaction conditions are 0 20 C, 10 minutes to 24 hours, and varying pH, and preferred conditions are 40C, 4 hours and pH 3 10. The quantitative ratio between AFFI GEl. 10 and the antibody may be selected within the range of up to about 50 mg of antibody per ml of AFFI GEL, since, in this range, the amount of antibody coupled with AFFI GEL increases as the amount of antibody increases. From the view points of the coupling efficiency and the purification efficiency in the affinity chromatography, the antibody is preferably used in an amount between I mg and 30 mg per ml of AFFI GEL. The thus produced antibody carrier coupling product is washed well with the same buffer solution as used for the reaction and then allowed to stand for several days or treated with ethanolamine hydrochloride in a final concentration of 0.05 M at 40C for an hour or by some other method so as to block the remaining unreacted active groups, and packed in an appropriate column as is per se known in the art to give an antibody column. In using the above antibody column for purification, a human immune interferon protein containing solution is dissolved in an almost neutral buffer, such as phosphate buffer or tris hydrochloride buffer, and subjected to adsorption of the antibody column. The column is then washed with the same buffer, followed by elution of IFN y.The eluent is, for example, a weakly acidic solution e.g.acetic acid solution , a polyethylene glycol containing solution, a solution containing a peptide capable of being more easily bound to the antibody as compared with the sample, a high concentration salt solution, or a mixed solution composed of these, which should preferably be incapable, as far as possible, of causing decomposition of human IFN y. The eluate from the column is neutralized with a buffer by the conventional method. As necessary, it may be subjected again to the above antibody column purification. The thus obtained human IFN y protein solution is dialyzed. The dialysate may be made into a powder by lyophilization, as necessary. In performing such lyophilization, a stabilizing agent, such as sorbitol, mannitol, dextrose, maltose or glycerol, may be added. The thus obtained human immune interferon protein, when determined for antiviral activity by the cytopathic inhibition assay using the vesicular stomatitis virus VSV on human amnion derived WISH cells, shows a specific activity of not less than 107 U mg. The human immune interferon protein produced in accordance with the present invention can be used for the same purposes and in the same manner of use as in the case of IFN y species obtained by the conventional methods.As compared with the conventional products, it contains smaller amounts of contaminant proteins and pyrogens and accordingly can be used more safely as a bulk substance for injectable preparations. The human IFN y protein according to the present invention has antiviral, antitumor, antiproliferative and immunopotentiating activities. The human IFN y protein in accordance with the invention can be mixed with a known, physiologically acceptable carrier, such as sterilized water, human serum albumin HSA or physiological saline, for parenteral or local administration. Thus, for instance, it can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. The preparation containing the human IFN y protein according to the invention may also contain other physiologically acceptable active ingredients such as salt, diluent, adjuvant, other carrier, buffer, binding agent, surfactant and preservative. The preparation for parenteral administration is supplied in the form of a sterile powder generally obtainable by lyophilization of an IFN y solution in ampuls, which can be used after dilution with a physiologically acceptable diluent. Furthermore, the preparation containing the humanIFN y protein according to the invention may contain another active ingredient, such as IFN a or IFN ss or a lymphokine such as interleukin 2, in an amount of 1 99 percent based on the substance according to the present invention.Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 shows the restriction enzyme cleavage map of the plasmid pHIT3709 as obtained in Reference Example 1 vii , the portion indicating the portion coding for a peptide supposed to be the signal peptide and the portion indicating the portion coding for the IFN y polypeptide.

The present invention will be further explained by way of the following reference and working examples, but these examples should be understood not to limit thereby the present invention.Escherichia coli 294 pREC206 disclosed in Reference Example 3 is deposited at Institute for Fermentation, Osaka IFO under the deposit No. 14320. Reference Example 1 i Isolation of mRNA coding for human IFN y Lymphocytes prepared from the human peripheral blood were incubated at 370C in the RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 fetal calf serum containing 15 ng ml of 12 O tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate TPA and 40 pg ml of concanavalin A for IFN y induction. After twenty four 24 10 hours, the thus induced human lymphocytes 1 x 10 cells were destructed in a thioguanidine solution 5M guanidine thiocyanate, 5 mercaptoethanol, 50 mbI Tris HC1, pH 7.6, 10 mM EDTA in a Teflon homogenizer.Then, sodium Nlauroyl sarcosinate was added in the concentration of 4 and the mixture after homogenization was layered over 6 ml of 5.7 M cesium chloride 5.7 M cesium chloride, 0.1 M ethylenediaminetetraacetate EDTA 1 and centrifuged at 1500 and 24000 rpm for 30 hours using a Beckman SW27 rotor to give an RNA precipitate. This RNA precipitate was dissolved in 0.25 sodium N lauroyl sarcosinate and then precipitated with ethanol to give 8.3 mg of RNA. This RNA was allowed to be absorbed, in a high concentration salt solution 0.5M NaCl, 10 mM Tris HC1 pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3 SDS , on oligo dT cellulose column and mRNA containing poly A was eluted with a low concentration salt solution 10 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3 SDS to give 700 pg of mRNA.This mRNA was further precipitated with ethanol, then dissolved in 0.2 ml of a solution 10 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.6, 2 mM EDTA, 0.3t SDS , treated at 650C for 2 minutes, and fractionated by 10 35 sucrose density gradient centrifugation at 200C and 25000 rpm for 21 hours using a Beckman SW27 rotor, to give 22 fractions. Aliquots of each fraction were injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes and the proteins synthesized were assayed for interferon activity antiviral activity as determined by the cytopa tunic effect inhibition assay using vesicular stomatitis virus on WISH cells derived from human amnion Stewart, W.E.Vide supra . In this manner, it was found that fraction 12 the sedimentation constant being 12 14S had an activity of 195 units per pg of RNA. The mRNA in the thus obtained fraction 12 weighed about 20 pg. ii Synthesis of single stranded DNA Using the above mRNA and a reverse transcriptase, 100 p1 of a reaction mixture 5 ijg of mRNA, 50 jig of oligo dT , 100 units of reverse transcriptase, 1 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP, 8 mM Mac12, 50 mM KC1, 10 mM dithiothreitol and 50 mM Tris HC1 pH 8.3 was incubated at 420C for 1 hour, then, deproteinized by adding phenol and treated with 0.1N NaOH at 70 C for 20 minutes for removal of RNA by decomposition. iii Synthesis of double stranded DNA The thus synthesized single stranded complementaryDNA was subjected to reaction in 50 jil of a reaction mixture the same mixture as above except that the mRNA and oligo dT were absent at 420C for 2 hours for synthesizing the double stranded DNA. iv Addition of dC tails The double stranded DNA was treated with nuclease S1 in 50 jil of a reaction mixture double stranded DNA, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 0.25 M NaCl, 1.5 mM ZnSO4, 60 units S1 nuclease at room temperature for 30 minutes.The reaction mixture was deproteinized by adding phenol and DNA was precipitated with ethanol. The thus obtainedDNA was reacted with terminal transferase in 50 jil of a reaction mixture double stranded DNA, 0.14 M potassium cacodylate, 0.3 M Tris base pH 7.6 , 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM CoC12, 0.15 mM dCTP, 30 units terminal transferase at 370C for 3 minutes for elongation of the double strandedDNA by about 20 deoxycytidine about 20 units at each 3 end of the DNA. This series of reactions gave about 300 ng of deoxycytidine tailed double stranded DNA. v Cleavage of Escherichia coli plasmid and addition of dG tails Separately, 10 jig of Escherichia coli plasmid pBR 322DNA was treated with restriction enzyme PstI in 50 jil of a reaction mixture 10 jig DNA, 50 mM NaCl, 6 mM Tris HC1 pH 7.4 , 6 mM MgC12, 6 mbI 2 mercaptoethanol, 100 pg ml bovine serum albumin, 20 units PstI at 370C for 3 hours for cleavage at the one PstI recognition site present in the pBR322DNA, the reaction mixture was then deproteinized with phenol and the DNA was further subjected to terminal transferase treatment in 50 jil of a reaction mixture t10 jig DNA, 0.14 M potassium cacodylate, 0.3 M Tris base pH 7.6, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM CoC12, 0.15 mM dGTP, 30 units terminal transferase at 3700 for 3 minutes for elongation of the above pBR322 plasmid DNA by about 8 deoxyguanidines at each 3 end thereof. vi Annealing of cDNA and transformation of Escherichia coli The annealing was effected by heating 0.1 jig of the thus obtained synthetic double stranded DNA and 0.5 jig of the above pBR322 plasmid in a solution containing 0.1M NaCl, 50 mM Tris HC1 pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA at 650C for 2 minutes and then at 450C for 2 hours, followed by gradual cooling. The transformation of Escherichia coli X1776 was performed by the method of Enea et al. J. Mol. Biol., 96, 495 509 l975 J. vii Isolation of cDNA containing plasmid About 8,500 tetracycline resistant colonies were thus isolated and the DNA of each colony was fixed to a nitrocellulose filter M. Grunstein and D.S. Hogness, vide supra3. Separately, based on the amino acid sequence of IFN y as reported by D.V. Goeddel et al. Nature, 295, 503 509 A A 1982 , two oligonuclotides of 5 TCCTGGCAGTAGC3 and G G T T 5lACATTCATATCCTCCT3 presumably corresponding to amino acids Nos. 1 5 Cys. Tyr. Cys. Gln. Asp and amino acidsNos. 77 82 Lys. Gln. Asp. Met. Asn. Val of said IFN y sequence, respectively, were chemically synthesized by the triester method R. Crea et al., vide supra .These oligonucleotides were treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase in 50 p1 of a reaction mixture 0.2 jig oligonucleotide, 50 mM Tris HC1 pH 8.0, 10 mM MgC12 10 iriM mercaptoethanol, SOjiOiy 32P ATP, 3 units T4 polynucleotide kinase at 370C for an hour. These oligopeptides thus labeled with 32p at the 5 end were used as probes and annealed with the DNA on the above mentioned nitrocellulose filter by the method of Lawn et al. Nucleic Acids Res., 9, 6103 6114 1981 . Four colonies were isolated by autoradiography which were reactive to the above two oligonucleotide probes. Plasmid DNAs were isolated from the bacterial cells of each of these strains by the alkali method H.C. Birnboim and J. Doly, Nucleic Acids Res., 7, 1513 1523 1979 .The inserts in the plasmid DNAs were excised with the PstI restriction enzyme. From among the isolated plasmids, the one containing the longest insert was chosen and named HpHIT3709A, The structure base sequence of the cDNA sequence inserted in the pHIT3709 plasmid was then determined by the dideoxynucleotide synthetic chain termination method and by the Maxam Gilbert method. Said primary structure was as shown in Fig. 2. Reference Example 2 Preparation of rec A promoter containing DNA fragment cf. Fig. 3 The plasmid pMCR6lf 300 vg Miki, T et al. vide supra was digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI andPstI Takara Shuzo . Agarose gel 1 electrophoresis gave a 1.25 kbp DNA fragment containing the rec A promoter portion, which fragment was eluted from the gel McDonell,M. W. et al., J. Mol. Biol., 110, 119 146 1977 . ThisDNA fragment was purified by phenol extraction, ether extraction and ethanol precipitation, then digested with the restriction enzyme HaeIII Takara Shuzo , and fractionated by 1.5 agarose gel electrophoresis to give a 300 b DNA fragment containing the rec A promoter portion. The fragment was purified in the same manner as mentioned above.This DNA fragment was further digested with the restriction enzyme HpaII Takara Shuzo . The digestion product was subjected to 8 acrylamide gel acrylamide bisacrylamide 19 1 electrophoresis so as to isolate the 148 b DNA fragment covering the sequence from 129 to 19 with the RNA transcription startpoint on the rec A promoter being counted as 1 as reported by Sancar et al. vide supra .The thus fractionated fragment was purified in the same manner as above. Separately, four oligonucleotides each containing a portion of the 3 end of the rec A promoter, namely 1 dCGGTATTACCCGGC, 2 dATGACAGGAGTAAAAG, 3 dTCATGCCGGGTAATAC and 4 dGATCCTTTTACTCCTG, were chemically synthesized by the phosphotriester method vide supra . Of these oligonucleotides, 2 and 3 were phosphorylated at the 5 end using polynucleotide kinase New England Biolabs NEB and ATP. Equal amounts 0.5 pg of the four oligonucleotides, namely oligonucleotides 1 and 4 and 5 phosphorylated oligonucleotides 2 and 3 , were mixed and, using T4 DNA ligase, they were ligated to one another by maintaining the mixture in 50 p1 of reaction medium 66 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.6, 6.6 riM MgC12, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM ATP, 300 units T4 DNA ligase at 140C for 16 hours. The reaction product was fractionated by 10 acrylamide gel acrylamide bisacrylamide 19 l electrophoresis. The 30 b DNA fragment, a ligation product of the oligonucleotides, was isolated and purified in the same manner as mentioned above. In the next place, the above mentioned 148 b DNA fragment and the 30 b DNA fragment were ligated together using T4 DNA ligase. The reaction product was fractionated by 8 acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 178 b DNA fragment which thus formed was isolated and purified. The cohesive termini of this DNA fragment were rendered blunt by contacting the DNA fragment with DNA polymerase I large fragment Bethesda Research Laboratories BRL in 30 jil of reaction mixture 40 rni potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 6.6 mM MgC12, 1 mM 2 mercaptoethanol, 20 pM dATP, 20 pM dGTP, 20 pM dGTP, 20 MR dTTP, 2 units DNA polymeraseI large fragment at 200C for 30 minutes. The product DNA was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and thereto was joined the BamHI linker dCCGGATCCGG BRL phosphorylated at the 5 end, using T4 DNA ligase. The product was digested with the restriction enzyme BamHI and inserted into the pBR322 DNA BamHI digestion product. The resultant recombinant DNA was used for transformation ofEscherichia coli strain 294. Ampicillin resistant, tetracycline sensitive transformants were selected and plasmid DNAs were isolated therefrom according to the method of Birnboim Doly vide supra. A plasmid which gave a 185 b DNA fragment upon digestion with the restriction enzyme BamHI was selected. At the same time, the base sequence of the 185 b DNA fragment thus cut out was determined according to the dideoxynucleotide synthetic chain termination method vide supra .In this manner, there was obtained the product of ligation of the 148 bDNA fragment from the 5 end portion of the rec A promoter with the BamHI linker as joined together in the expected manner. Its nucleotide sequence was as follows EMI21.1 GCCGCCGCCCTTACGAAGTCGCCGCTGGCACTACGCCACGCAGCAGTCCGATGA EMI21.2 CGCATACGAACGTCTGGAACACCGTTGTTAAAGATGTTTTGTGARCTATGACATACT EMI21.3 CGTATGTCATATTARCGAAGTTGTCTTGTATAACTGATAGGCCATAATGGGCCGTAC EMI21.4 TGTCCTCATTTTCCTAG As compared with the report of Sancar, A et al. vide supra , the above sequence contains one more base pair A at 121. A pBR322 plasmid with this DNA fragment inserted therein with the same orientation of the rec A promoter with that of the ampicillin resistance offering S lactamase gene was named pREC3. Reference Example 3 Construction of rec A promoter containing expression vector cf. Fig. 4 The plasmid pREC3 was digested with the restriction enzyme BamHI, followed by 6 acrylamide gel electrophoresis, which gave a 185 b rec A promoter unit DNA.The cohesive termini of this DNA were rendered blunt with S1 nuclease BRL in 100 pl of reaction mixture 0.5 pgDNA, 0.03 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, 0.3 M NaCl, 4.5 mM ZnC12, 3 units S1 nuclease at 220C for 30 minutes and then the DNA was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The EcoRI linker dGGAATTCC BRL was phosphorylated at the 5 end and ligated with the aboveDNA using T4 DNA ligase. The ligation product was digested with the restriction enzyme EcoRI Takara Shuzo and ligated with the pBR322 DNA digested with the same enzyme.The ligation product was used for transformation ofEscherichia coli strain 294. Ampicillin resistant and tetracycline resistant transformants were selected.Plasmid DNAs were isolated from these transformants according to the method of Birnboim Doly vide supra . Based on the restriction enzyme cleavage pattern, a plasmid pREC206 containing the rec A promoter in the same orientation as that of the 6 lactamase gene and a plasmid pREC207 containing the rec A promoter in the opposite orientation to the ss lactamase gene were selected. Escherichia coli 294 was transformed with the plasmid pREC206 to obtain Escherichia coli 294 pREC206. Example 1 The plasmid pHIT3709 obtained in Reference Example 1 was cleaved with the restriction enzyme PstI to give aPstI fragment containing the structural gene for IFN y.This fragment was partially cleaved with the restriction enzyme BstNI NEB to give a BstNI PstI fragment cleaved at the BstNI site within the IFN y structural gene. TheBstNI cleavage site was filled in with DNA polymerase I large fragment, followed by ligation with the oligonucleotide adapter AATTCATGTGTTATTGTC GTACACAATAACAG chemically synthesized by the phosphotriester method mentioned above and containing the protein synthesis start codon ATG, using T4 DNA ligase. Separately, the plasmid pREC206 obtained in ReferenceExample 3 was digested with the restriction enzyme PstI and further subjected to partial digestion with the restriction enzyme EcoRI. The digestion product was subjected to 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and a 3.8 KbDNA fragment was isolated and purified by the method described in Reference Example 2. This DNA and the above mentioned IFN y structural gene oligonucleotide adapter ligation product were ligated together using T4 DNA ligase. The thus produced ligation product was used for transformation of Escherichia coli strain 294, and tetracycline resistant transformants were selected. PlasmidDNAs were isolated from these transformants by the BirnboimDoly method vide supra and, based on the restriction enzyme cleavage pattern, an expression plasmid pHITrecl202 with the rec A promoter, oligonucleotide adapter and humanIFN y structural gene inserted in succession therein was selected. Cf, Fig. 5 . Example 2 Cf. Fig. 6 i The plasmid pHITrecl202 obtained in Example 1 was partially cleaved with the restriction enzyme EcoRI so as to convert the circular DNA to the linear form. The resultant EcoRI cohesive termini were repaired with DNA polymerase I large fragment. This DNA was reconverted to the circular form using T4 DNA ligase and used for transformation of Escherichia coli strain 294. Tetracyclineresistant transformants were selected and plasmid DNAs were isolated therefrom by the Birnboim Doly method vide supra . Based on the restriction enzyme cleavage pattern, an IFN y expression plasmid, pHITrecl208, which did not contain the EcoRI recognition site originally found in pHITrecl202 at the junction site between the rec A promoter and IFN y gene any more, was selected. ii pHITrecl208 was cleaved with the restriction enzymesEcoRI and PstI, the cleavage product was subjected to 1.2 agarose gel electrophoresis, and a 1.2 Kb DNA fragment was isolated and purified by the procedure described inReference Example 1. Separately, pREC206 was digested with the restriction enzyme PstI and further subjected to partial digestion with the restriction enzyme EcoRI, followed by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis of the digestion product, and a 3.8 Kb DNA fragment containing the rec A promoter portion was isolated and purified by the procedure described in ReferenceExample 1. This DNA and the above mentioned, pHITrecl208 derived 1.2 Kb DNA containing a rec A promoter and IFN y gene were ligated together using T4 DNA ligase and the ligation product was used for transformation of Escherichia coli strain 294. Tetracycline resistant transformants were selected and plasmid DNAs were isolated therefrom by theBirnboim Doly method vide supra . Based on the restriction enzyme cleavage pattern, an IFN y expression plasmid, pHITrec2202, with two rec A promoter containing DNA fragments inserted upstream from the IFN Y gene in the same orientation as said gene was selected. iii pHITrec2202 was subjected to digestion with the restriction enzyme PstI and further to partial cleavage with the restriction enzyme EcoRI, followed by 1.2 agarose gel electrophoresis, and a 1.4 Kb DNA fragment containing two rec A promoters and the IFN y gene was isolated and purified by the procedure described in Reference Example 1. This DNA and the above mentioned, pREC 206 derived, a rec A promoter containing 3.8 Kb EcoRI PstI DNA fragment were ligated together and the ligation product was used for transformation of Escherichia coli strain 294.Tetracycline resistant transformants were selected and plasmid DNAs were isolated therefrom by the Birnboim Doly method vide supra . Based on the restriction enzyme cleavage pattern, an expression plasmid, pHITrec3202, with three rec A promoters connected in series as a trimer and inserted therein upstream from the IFN y gene in the same directionality as that of said gene was selected. Example 3 Escherichia coli 294 transformants carrying the IFN y expression plasmids constructed in Examples 1 and 2, namely pHITrecl202, 1208, 2202 and 3202, respectively were grown in 200 ml Erlenmeyer flasks each containing 10 ml of M9 medium vide supra containing 8 Vg ml of tetracycline, 0.4 of casamino acids and 1 of glucose at 370C. When the growth reached KU 200, nalidixic acid was added to a concentration of 50 pg ml and the cultivation was continued for further 5 hours. Cells were harvested from each culture by centrifugation and suspended in 1 ml of 0.05 MTris HCl pH 7.6 containing 10 of sucrose.To this suspension, there were added 5 jil of 0.2 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride PMSF , 40 jil of 5 M NaCl, 40 Frl of 0.2 M EDTA, 40 jil of 1 M spermidine hydrochloride and 20 p1 of 10 mg ml lysozyme. After standing at OOC for 1 hour, the mixture was treated at 370C for 3 minutes. This lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm Servall centrifuge SS 34 rotor for 30 minutes. The supernatant thus obtained was assyed for the antiviral activity by the test for inhibition of the cytopathic effect of vesicular stomatitis virus VSV on human amnion derived WISH cells.

The IFN y expression plasmid containing Escherichia coli DM1187 transformants were cultured in 200 ml Erlenmeyer flasks each containing 10 ml of M9 medium containing 8 pg ml of tetracycline, 0.4 of casamino acids and 1 of glucose at 370C for 10 hours. Cells were collected from the culture broth by centrifugation. The supernatant prepared by the procedure described in Example 3 was assayed for the antiviral activity. The results obtained are given below.

The culture broth obtained 1.2 liters was centrifuged and the cells thus collected were suspended in 60 ml of 0.05 M Tris HCl pH 7.6 containing 10 of sucrose. To this cell suspension, there were added 0.3 ml of 0.2 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride PMSF , 2.4 ml of 5 M NaCI, 2.4 ml of 0.2 M ethylenediaminetetraacetate EDTA , 2.4 ml of 1 M spermidine and 2.4 ml of 5 mg ml lysozyme. After standing at OOC for 1 hour, the mixture was treated at 370C for 5 minutes and further treated on a sonicator ARTER, USA at 0 C for 30 seconds. This lysate was centrifuged at 105,000 x g for 1 hour. The supernatant thus collected amounted to 66 ml. This supernatant 60 ml was diluted with 20 mMTris HCl, pH 7.6 TEN containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.15 M NaCl to make 150 ml and submitted to an anti IFN y antibody column 8 ml prepared by the procedure described inReference Example 10 contained in the specification of patent application 83 109 403.2 claiming the priority ofPCT JP82 00445 by the present applicant. After adequate washing with TEN, the column was further washed with TEN containing 0.01 Nonidet P 40 Shell and 0.5 M NaCI.Thereafter, IFN y was eluted with 0.1 M acetic acid containing 0.25 M NaC1 and the eluate was immediately neutralized with 1 M Tris HCl pH 7.6. The solution thus obtained was dialyzed against distilled water at 40C for 16 hours and the dialysate was frozen with acetone dry ice and lyophilized to give a powder. The results obtained are summarized below.

This protein was submitted to the experiments mentioned below. Example 6Properties of human immune interferon protein i Molecular weight The protein obtained in Example 5 was treated with 2 mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel 17.5 electrophoresis 15 mV, 6 hoursj. Upon coomassie blue staining, the protein could be confirmed as a single band. Based on the relation between the distance of migration of a molecular weight marker electrophoresed simultaneously and the distance of migration of the protein, the molecular weight of the protein was estimated at 17,000 1,000. On the other hand, when the protein was not treated with 2 mercaptoethanol, another band was detected at a position corresponding to the molecular weight of 33,000 2,000.Since this value is about two times the molecular weight of IFN y, i.e. 17,000 1,000, this band is supposedly due to the dimer of INF y. ii Amino acid analysis A portion of the protein obtained in Example 5 was placed in a glass test tube for hydrolysis. After addition of constant boiling point hydrochloric acid containing 200 volumes v w of 4 thioglycolic acid, the tube was sealed under reduced pressure. The hydrolysis was conducted at 11000 for 24, 48 or 72 hours. Thereafter, the tube was opened, the hydrochloric acid was removed under reduced pressure, and the residue was dissolved in 0.02 N hydrochloric acid and subjected to amino acid analysis on aHitachi model 835 high speed amino acid analyzer. As for cystine and cysteine, they were determined together by the method of Hirs Methods in Enzymology, 11, 197 199 1967 1, namely in the form of cysteic acid on the amino acid analyzer following performic acid oxidation of the protein and the same 24 hour hydrolysis as above.The amino acid analysis values obtained after 24, 48 and 72 hours of hydrolysis were averaged except for serine, threonine, tyrosine and tryptophan, the values for which were determined by extrapolation of the hydrolysis time to 0 hour. The results obtained are shown in Table 2.
