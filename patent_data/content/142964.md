# Apparatus and method for thermal ink transfer printing.

## Abstract
A plurality of heat generating resistors 11a, 11b arranged in line in a thermal head are driven such that two consecutive heat generating resistors 11a, 11b are com bined to cover a single picture element whose desired density is represented by each datum. A head drive circuit is provided so that only a first heat generating resistor 11a is energized when the desired density is below a predeter mined value, and that both the first and second heat generating resistors 11a, 11b are energized when the desired density is equal to or above the predetermined value. The energizing duration of the second heat generating resistor 11b is set to be within the energizing duration of the first heat generating resistor 11a to reduce printing time, and the end of the energizing duration of the second heat generating resistor 11b corresponds to the end of energiz ing duration of the first heat generating resistor 11a so as to ensure linearity in tone value.
