# Open end spun slub yarns.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of and an apparatus for open end spinning a novelty yarn especially slub yarns , and the yarn so produced. A sliver is fed to the fi ber separating device of an open end spinning apparatus to form distinct fibers, the fibers are air transported in a fiber flow path to the twisting device, control formation of effects particularly slubs is effected during air transport of the distinct fibers in their path, the formed effects are occasionally passed to the twisting device e.g. pseudo randomly , the fibers fed to the twisting device are twisted into a continuous strand of effect yarn particularly slub yarn , and the continuous strand of effect yarn is taken up. The controlled formation of effects is preferably accom plished by introducing a needle into the fiber flow path in the transport section, the fibers collecting on the needle. The fibers are passed to the twisting device by withdrawing the needle from the fiber flow. Virtually any type of conven tional open end spinning apparatus may be modified to practice the slub yarn spinning according to the invention.
