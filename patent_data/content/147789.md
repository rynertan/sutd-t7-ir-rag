# Communication network system.

## Abstract
Transmission line groups consisting of a plurality of loop like transmission routes 1...5, 10...50, 100...500 are mutually connected via transmission controllers and are arranged in a two or three dimensional space. Processing units are thus connected as a homogeneous network in matrix or mesh form by means of the loop like transmission routes. The transmission controllers corresponding to the nodes 11...51 of the network have a communication management function such that they send the data without grasping the situation on the transmission routes, indepen dently check the trouble between the adjacent transmission controllers, and specify the position of trouble. A communi cation network system such as a high local area network LAN or the like can be realized.
