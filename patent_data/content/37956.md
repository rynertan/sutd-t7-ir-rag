# A rotary anode for an X ray tube and a method for manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a rotary anode for an X ray tube which comprises an anode body 1 formed of graphite, a preformed sheet 2 formed of rhenium and bonded to the top surface of the anode body 1 , and a target layer 3 formed of tungsten or an alloy thereof and bonded to the top surface of the preformed sheet 2 . This rotary anode may further comprise a preformed plate 13 formed of molybdenum and interposed between and bonded to the preformed sheet and the target layer. Also disclosed is a method for manufacturing the rotary anode.
