# Automobile fuel feed apparatus.

## Abstract
In an automobile fuel feed apparatus for feeding fuel through atomization effected by ultrasonic, a tubular trem bler 10 supported on an ultrasonic vibrator 9 is disposed almost on an axis in an engine intake pipe 13 and has a fuel passing through hole 28 in the wall thereof. The fuel pass ing through hole 28 is opened at an axial intermediate por tion of the engine intake pipe 13 . A fuel jet tip 29 of the electromagnetic injection valve 8 is disposed oppositely to the fuel passing through hole 28 so as to jet the fuel diver gently against an inside wall of the tubular trembler 10 through the fuel passing through hole 28 . The electromagnetic injection valve 8 and the ultrasonic vibrator 9 are disposed respectively substantially orthog onal to the axis of the tubular trembler 10 . The fuel is in jected against the inside wall of the tubular trember 10 through the fuel passing through hole 28 and is atomized. When the fuel is jetted into the fuel passing through hole 28 from the fuel jet tip 29 , the relative distance x from the fuel jet tip 29 to the fuel passing through hole 28 inside wall is determined so that most of the injected fuel will strike the inner wall of the tubular trembler 10 , within the dimen sons determined by the bore d the fuel passing through hole 28 , the inside diameter D and the length L of the tubular trembler 10 and the angle Ï‘ of spread the injected fuel.
