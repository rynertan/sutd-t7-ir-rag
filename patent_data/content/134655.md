# METHOD OF, AND APPARATUS FOR, SCRAMBLING A TV PICTURE

## Abstract
A television signal transmission system of this invention transmits a television signal having a polarity inverted portion in association with a scene change portion and a polarity inverted portion for a predetermined time interval independently of the scene change portion. The scrambled signal is generated by detecting a change in the scene represented by the television signal and generating a scene change identification signal in response thereto generating a key code signal having a predetermined pattern combining said scene change identification signal and said key code signal to produce said first control signal producing said second control signal and scrambling the television signal in response to said first control signal or said second control signal.
