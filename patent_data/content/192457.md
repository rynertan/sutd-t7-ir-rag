# Silencer.

## Abstract
A silencer includes an air passage tube 2 having an air inlet 4 for introducing air thereinto, and a side branch tube 12 connected to the air passage tube and having a closed end 16 for attenuating noise produced by the air introduced into the air passage tube. The side branch tube may be either a flexible tube or have a flexible portion for allowing convenient bending and mounting thereof in the available space. The side branch tube may comprise a pair of different tube portions connected to each other. The side branch tube may have a water drain hole 22 defined in its lowermost portion and preferably the cross sectional area of the water drain hole is no greater than 1 of the cross sectional area of the side branch tube. The side branch tube serves to attenuate high frequency noise and the silencer may addi tionally include a resonator chamber 11 for attenuating low frequency noise.
