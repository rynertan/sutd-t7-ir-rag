# A pressure sensitive adhesive and a pressure sensitive adhesive film having thereon a layer of the same.

## Abstract
A pressure sensitive adhesive film reducible in adhesive force by UV light comprises a base film permeable to UV light and a layer of a pressure sensitive adhesive on one side of the base film. The adhesive comprises one elastic polymer selected from apolymer composed of acrylic acid ester copolymersor a saturated copolyester composed of dibasic carboxylic acids and dihydroxy alcohols 15 200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the elastic polymer of an UV light polymerizable acrylic acid ester having not less than two acryloyl or methacryloyl groups in the molecule and a molecular weight of not more than 1000 A photopolymerization initiator for inducing the photo polymerization of the UV light polymerizable acrylic acid ester The film is suitable as a dicing film in dicing a semiconductor wafer to dices in which the wafer is fixed on the film with a relatively large adhesive force and by UV light radiation from the other side the adhesive force of the film is reduced that the dice loosely adheres onto the film.
