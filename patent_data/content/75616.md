# Collapsible wing aircraft.

## Abstract
The toy glider 10 comprises delta formed wings 82, 84 deployable between a launch configuration with said wings collapsed and a flight configuration with said wings extended. Extension is effected by a hairpin spring 92 having its legs 90, 91 engaged with the wings 82, 84 along respective hinge lines 36, 38 . The spring 92 is rotatably restorable in its entirety about the longitudinal axis of the glider 10 . The legs 90, 91 of the spring 92 are movable away from each other as an adjunct to the removal of a restraint maintaining the wings 82, 84 in the launch configuration, from a first orientation in which energy is stored therein in potential form to a second orientation in which conversion of the energy stored from potential to kinetic form deploys the wings. The present glider can be economically constructed and has superior launch and flight characteristics.

## Description
COLLAPSIBLE WING AIRCRAFTThe present invention relates to heavier than air type aircraft and, more particularly, to aircraft of that type which have collapsible wings and an on board power source for biasing the wings from their collapsed configuration into an extended, flight configuration.One application in which the principles of the present invention have been applied with singular success is in the provision of toy gliders, and the principles of the invention will accordingly be explained and developed primarily with reference to that application. It is to be understood, however, that this is being done for brevity and clarity and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined in the claims appended hereto. Aircraft with deployable wings are well known with the most familiar of these probably being versions of the swing wing design. The prior art relating to deployable wing aircraft consists of U.S. Patents Nos. 1,054,374 issued February 25, 1913, to Voigt 1,190,343 issued July 11, 1916, to Tyrell 1,353,147 issued September 21, 1920, to Converse 1,599,280 issued September 7, 1926, to Lewis 2,221,012 issued November 12, 1940, to Walker 3,204,368 issued September 7, 1965, to Effinger, Jr. 3,408,767 issued November 5, 1968, toAnderson and 3,433,210 issued March 18, 1969, to Schnitz Austrian Patent No. 165,755 German Patent No 903,073 andItalian Patent No. 499,097.It is one important and primary object of the invention to provide novel, improved aircraft of the deployable wing type.Another, also important and primary object of the invention resides in the provision of deployable wing aircraft with advantages and features that are not possessed by heretofore proposed aircraft of that type.Still other important, but more specific, objects of the invention include the provision of aircraft in accord with the preceding object which can be economically constructed and which have superior launch and flight characteristics. Those and other important objects of the invention are attained by a novel construction in which the aircraft wings have sections that are hinged to each other along fore andaft hinge lines. The wings can be collapsed to a launch configuration by displacing adjacent wing sections about the hinge line shared by them and the wings are deployed from that configuration to an extended flight configuration by an on board power source to spread the wings, typically into a modified delta wing form.The term launch is employed herein in a somewhat broader than conventional sense as the wings of aircraft employing the principles of my invention may be collapsed for purposes of storage, transportation, etc. Irrespective of the purpose for which the wings are collapsed, the resulting configuration of the aircraft will be referred to as the launch configuration.Other important objects and features and additional advantages of the invention will become apparent from the appended claims and as the ensuing detailed description and discussion proceeds in conjunction with the accompanying drawing, in which Figure 1 is a top view of a toy glider embodying and con structed in accord with the principles of the present invention, the wings of the glider being in an extended, flight configuration Figure 2 is a side view of the glider Figure 3 is a rear view of the glider Figure 4 is a partial bottom view of the glider Figure 5 is a side view of the glider with the wings in a collapsed, launch configuration Figure 6 is a top view of the glider with the wings in the launch configuration Figure 7 is a rear view of the glider with the wings par tially deployed to show the relationship between the wings and a power source by which they are deployed from the launch configuration to the flight configuration Figure 8 is a pictorial view of one procedure and mechanism which can be used to launch the glider and Figure 9 is a plan view of a blank which can be folded to form the rear fuselage, wings, rudder, and elevons or elevators of the glider.Referring now to the drawing, Figures 1 7 depict a toy glider 10 constructed in accord with, and embodying, the principles of the present invention.The description of glider 10 which follows, and the appended claims, employ a number of direction related terms such as upper, lower, vertical, etc. Unless otherwise specified, these are related to the glider as oriented in its flight attitude.The major components of glider 10 are a fuselage 12, wings 14 and 16 of a modified delta configuration, and an on board power source 18 for deploying wings 14 and 16 from the collapsed, launch configuration shown in Figures 5 and 6 to the extended, flight configuration shown in Figures 1 4.Fuselage 12 of the airplane has an elongated, front member or keel 20 arranged with its axis of elongation coincidental with a fore and aft axis 22 of the glider. Keel 20 has a generally rectangular configuration with its major crosssectional dimension extending vertically. Transversely ex tending launching lugs 24 and 26 are formed at the forward end of the keel which will typically be fabricated by molding from a styrene or other suitable plastic.The rear or aft section 28 of fuselage 12 and wings 14 and 16 are formed by folding a blank 29 cut from a durable, flexible, sheet material see Figure 9 . Various cardboards, papers, plastics, plastic laminated papers, and other materials can be employed. The preferred material, at present, is TWEK, a spunbonded olefin produced by E.I. Dupont de Nemours and Co. and described in more detail in DupontBulletin TK 3 dated December 1978.The rear section 28 of fuselage 12 is formed by folding blank 29 along an axis of symmetry 30 corresponding to the fore and aft centerline 22 of glieder 10 and again along lines 31 and 32, leaving elongated, depending flaps 33 and 34, best shown in Figure 3. The forward ends of those flaps are permanently fixed to opposite sides of keel 20, preferably by an appropriate adhesive such as UPACO Adhesive, Inc. 9229 A Hot Melt Adhesive.Typically, the keel will be located in a protruding position as shown in Figures 1 and 2 to optimally locate the center of gravity of the glider. Those portions of the flaps extending rearwardly from the aft end of keel 20 constitute the rear section 28 of fuselage 12 and, also, provide a rudder 35.Blank 29 is also creased to form hinge lines 36 and 38 which, as best shown in Figure 1, are coincidental with the leading edges of wings 14 and 16. The blank is then folded back on itself along hinge lines 36 and 38, giving the wings upper skins 40 and 42 see Figure 1 and lower skins 44 and 46 see Figures 3 and 4 . Upper skins 40 and 42 are joined to lower skins 44 and 46 at the outboard edges of those skins along hinge lines 36 and 38, respectively. In the illustrated glider 10, the upper skins 40 and 42 combine to form a diamond configuration and the lower skins, which are substantially shorter than the upper skins, have mirror image related, triangular configurations. Those skilled in the relevant arts will readily recognize that the wing design just described differs from a delta wing primarily only in the presence of those triangular portions of the upper wing skins aft of the leading edges of wings 14 and 16.Blank 29 ist also folded at the inboard edges of lower wing skins 44 and 46 along fore and aft extending lines 48 and 50 see Figure 3 , forming depending flaps 52 and 54. These overlie the sides 33 and 34 of rear fuselage 28 and are permanently affixed to the latter as by the UPACO adhesive identified above.Referring again to Figure 1, the upper skins 40 and 42 of wings 14 and 16 are creased or scored along lines 56 and 58 at the rear of the glider, and slits 60 and 62 are formed from the outboard ends of the score lines to the trailing edges 64 and 66 of the wings. This leaves tabs 68 and 70 which function as elevons or elevators.Turning now to both Figures 1 and 4, hinge lines 72 and 74 extending in generally the same direction as the fore andaft axis 22 of glider 10 are formed in the upper skins 40 and 42 of wings 14 and 16 intermediate the inboard and outboard edges of those wings as by creasing, scoring, etc. and similar hinge lines 76 and 78 are formed in the lower skins 44 and 46 of the wings. Hinge lines 72, 74, 76, and 78 and the hinge lines 36 and 38 described earlier all converge toward a common location 80 at the forwardmost end or tip of the wing structure.Hinge line 72 divides the upper skin 40 of wing 14 into inboard and outboard sections 81 and 82 which can be displaced or folded relative to each other along the hinge line. The upper skin 42 of wing 16 and the lower skins 44 and 46 of wings 14 and 16 are divided into similarly related inboard and outboard sections 83 and 84, 85 and 86, and 87 and 88 along hinge lines 74, 76, and 78.The wing construction just described is provided so that wings 14 and 16 can be collapsed into the relatively streamlined launch configuration shown in Figures 5 and 6 and deployed from that configuration to the extended, flight position shown in Figures 1 4. It is the function of the on board power source 18 to effect that deployment coincidentally with the removal from the glider of forces maintaining wings 14 and 16 in the launch configuration.In the illustrated, exemplary glider 10 this energy producing device is one of the snap action type as will become apparent hereinafter and, otherwise characterized, is an elastic type of energy storage device. The particular device of that character employed in glider 10 is a hairpin type spring having legs 90 and 91 and a single turn spring coil 92.Spring 18 is housed in the wings 14 and 16 of the glider with leg 90 in wing 14 and leg 91 in wing 16. The spring is in stalled by squeezing those legs together and inserting them into the wings through apertures in wings 14 and 16, respectively, at the tip 80 of the wing structure.In the extended, flight configuration shown in Figure 1, the legs 90 and 91 of spring 18 engage wings 14 and 16 along hinge lines 36 and 38. They exert outwardly directed forces, indicated by arrows 95 and 96, which maintain the wings in the flight configuration.Wings 14 and 16 are collapsed by exerting opposite directed forces inwardly toward the fore and aft axis 22 of glider 10 on them at the level of hinge lines 36 and 38. This causes the upper and lower, inboard and outboard sections 81 and 82 and 85 and 86 of wing 14 to fold toward each other along hinge lines 72 and 76, and the two outboard sections 82 and 86 to concomitantly fold or hinge away from each other along hinge line 36. This results in wing 14 passing through the configuration shown in Figure 7 and then assuming the configuration shown in Figures 5 and 6 in which the wing lies flat against fuselage 12 with its major transverse dimension at right angles to what it was with that wing in the extended, flight configuration of Figures 1 see Figures 5 and 6 . By similar relative displacements of its upper and lower inboard and outboard sections and its two outboard sections, wing 16 is displaced to a collapsed configuration bearing a mirror image relationship to that of wing 14 as best shown in Figure 6.Application of the forces just discussed to displace wings 14 and 16 to the illustrated, launch configuration concurrently cause the leg 90 of spring 18 to shift upwardly from hinge line 36 to the hinge line 72 between the inboard and outboard sections 81 and 82 of upper skin 40 of wing 14.These forces concurrently shift leg 91 of the spring downwardly from its location at hinge line 38 of wing 16 to the hinge line 78 between the inboard and outboard sections 87 and 88 of that wing s bottom skin 46. This action may be reversed with leg 90 sliding along lower outboard skin section 86 of wing 14 to hinge line 76 and leg 91 shifting along upper outboard skin section 84 of wing 16 to hinge line 74. These movements are facilitated by the relatively low coefficient of friction of the preferred wing material and by loops 97 and 98 at the free ends of the spring legs.The displacement of the spring legs just described rotates the spring as an entity through an angle of approximately 900 about an axis lying in the same vertical plane as the fore and aft axis of symmetry 22 of glider 10. As this occurs, the distance between the free ends of the spring legs is decreased from 50 and 24 to 25 and 14 millimeters in one exemplary toy glider of the type illustrated in the drawing . This loads or stresses, storing potential energy in, the spring.Upon removal of launch configuration maintaining forces acting in the directions just described, spring 18 restores to the relaxed configuration shown in Figure 1, the spring rotating in its entirety and about its axis of symmetry 0 through the same 90 angle discussed above, but in the op posite direction. Because of the rotary motion of the spring, the above discussed physical relationship between the spring and wings 14 and 16, and the elasticity of the material from which the wings are fabricated, the spring will first exert on the wings a force which increases in magnitude from a relatively low level in proportion to the angular displacement of the spring. As this force reaches a maximum, the spring snaps through the remainder of its travel to the relaxed condition.As the spring restores to its relaxed condition, the spring legs shift from the hinge lines at which they are disposed with the wings in the collapsed configuration to hinge lines 36 and 38. Those movements of the spring legs result in their spreading or deploying wings 14 and 16 to the extended, flight configuration of Figures 1 and 3 by reversing the above discussed, folding or hinged movements of the inborad and outboard skin sections relative to each other along the hinge lines. One exemplary technique for launching glider 10 and the device employed for that purpose are shown in Figure 8.The launcher, identified by reference character 100, includes a handle 102 to which an elastic band 104 is fixed.To launch glider 10, wings 14 and 16 are collapsed as described above and held in that configuration. The free end of elastic band 104 is hooked over one of the launching lugs 24 or 26 at the forward end of the glider, the band stretched, and the glider released vertically, allowing the elastic to contract and propel the glider into a vertical climb.Initially, the rate of climb is relatively high. Under these conditions, air resistance or friction between the air and the glider generates forces with vectors which maintain wings 14 and 16 in the collapsed, streamlined, launch configuration. This is desirable as it enables the glider to climb higher for a launching force of given magnitude than it would be able to do if the wings were in the extended, flight configuration or even in a partially deployed configuration such as that shown in Figure 7.The desirable attribute of the wings remaining in the collapsed configuration during launch is promoted by the novel aircraft design because, as discussed above, the spring force available to deploy the wings to the flight configuration is relatively low when the wings are fully collapsed.As the glider reaches the zenith of the launch, the vector forces generated by air resistance decrease to a level below those which spring 18 is capable of generating. At this point, therefore, the spring rotatably restores from theFigure 5 position to the Figure 1 position. As discussed above, that deploys wings 14 and 16 to the flight configuration, which makes them capable of generating the greatest lift and thereby maximizing the flight time of the glider. The illustrated launcher is merely exemplary. Aircraft involving the principles of the present invention can equally well be launched by other techniques including those employing compressed gases and spring and other mechanical devices. And they can also be carried aloft by a rocket or other vehicle, for example.As indicated previously, glider 10 is only one preferred embodiment of the present invention. Consequently, the foregoing detailed description and discussion of that embodiment is not intended to limit the scope of coverage, especially as the principles of the invention may be embodied in devices and machines which differ radically from glider 10 in size, configuration, materials of construction, wing deploying power source, etc.
