# Process for heating thin surface layers.

## Abstract
In the lamination of thermoplastic polymer layers to sub strates a thin surface layer of the substrate can be heated to improve adhesion without substantially heating the mass of the substrate by advancing the exposed surface of the thin layer in surface conforming contact with a heated surface for 0.1 to one second at an interface pressure of 0.1 to 5 kilograms per centimeter of substrate width, the heated surface having an initial temperature of 35 350 C.
