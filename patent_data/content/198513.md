# Analytical method and apparatus for determining fluorescence or phosphorescence.

## Abstract
A turnable holding a train of reaction containers there on is continuously turned by one revolution plus an angle for a share of one container and then stopped. This makes one cycle. On the route of transfer of the reaction container, there are provided a light irradiation position and a light collection position. The reaction container into which a sample and a mark er reagent have been introduced is transferred such that it does not stop at the irradiation position and the light collec tion position. The reaction container to which a monochro matic light for excitation has been irradiated at the irradi ation position is transferred toward the light collection posi tion. Fluorescence coming from the light collection position is lead to a photodetector, and the concentration of the tar get substance in the sample is determined from the detect ed fluorescence after arithmetic processing. Since the light collection position is provided at a place different from the irradiation position in the present appara tus, it is possible to measure fluorescence originating from the sample which is substantially free from the influence of background fluorescence.
