# Apparatus and method for controlling the flow of a fluid.

## Abstract
A plurality of spray nozzles are utilized to introduce a fluid into a vessel. Control valves are associated with each one of the plurality of spray nozzles. The control valves are either fully closed or fully open. The actual value of a process vari able is compared to the desired value of the process variable to generate a difference signal. Control signals are generated in response to the difference signal. Different combinations of the control valves are opened in response to the control sign als so as to provide a fluid flow rate which will maintain the actual value of the process variable substantially equal to the desired value. The on off nature of the control valves provides a substantially maximum pressure drop across the spray noz zles when fluid is flowing through the spray nozzles.
