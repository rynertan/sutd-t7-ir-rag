# Drive mechanisms for diaphragm pumps and the like.

## Abstract
A diaphragm pump comprising a supporting structure 13, a rotatable input member 25 and first and second bearings 39 and 41 mounted on the input member so that the rotation of the input member 25 causes the second bearing 41 to nutate. Each of the bearings 39 and 41 have outer races 45, and the outer race of the first bearing 39 is coupled to the supporting structure 13 by a mounting member 49 of sheet material. A region of the diaphragm 95 of the pump forms a portion of a pumping chamber 87, and a drive member 69 is provided for moving the region of the diaphragm 95 in at least one direction. First and second mounting members 71 and 73 couple the outer race 45 of the second bearing 41 to the drive member 69 so that nutation of the second bearing 41 causes the pump to operate.
