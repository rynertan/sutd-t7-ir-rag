# Process for producing pitch based graphite fibres.

## Abstract
A process for producing a pitch based graphite fiber comprises treating a pitch fiber in an oxidative gas atmo sphere to render it infusible, said pitch fiber being obtained by melt spinning a carbon aceous pitch, then heat treating the infusiblized fiber at 400 750 C in an inert gas atmo sphere to obtain a precarbonized fiber substantially con taining oxygen, then raising the temperature to 2,000 3,000 C at a rate of 500 C or higher per minute in an inert gas atmosphere and heat treating the precarbonized fiber at the raised temperature of 2,000 3000 C in said inert gas atmosphere.
