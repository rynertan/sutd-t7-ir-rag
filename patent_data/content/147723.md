# Current limit circuit in x ray generator.

## Abstract
Current limit protection is provided to ensure that the current flow within the transistor inverter does not exceed a predetermined safe level to thereby cause damage to the various components such as the transistor inverters. The current in the primary of the transformer is sensed and a representative signal is compared with a reference signal to provide a digital output indicating whether a safe limit has been exceeded. A logic network then operates on the output signal to shut down or reduce the system operation accord ingly. In the event of a shutdown, current decay is accom modated by shutting off only the top transistors in the inverter diagonals so as to thereby allow the remaining current to flow in the bottom transistors and diodes.
