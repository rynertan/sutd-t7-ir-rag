## Description
9 AMINOALKYLFLUORENES, PROCESS THEREFOR AND ANTIARRHYTHMIC FORMULATIONS THEREOF. This invention concerns fluorenes which bear an aminoalkyl substituent at the 9 position, such compounds being useful antiarrhythmic agents. The invention also embraces pharmaceutical formulations containing the novel fluorenes as well as processes for their preparation. Cardiovascular disorders are responsible for thousands of deaths each year. Cardiac arrhythmias are one of these disorders contributing to such deaths.While the true causes of arrhythmias are unknown, it is believed that they are caused by some abnormality in the rate, regularity or site of origin of cardiac impulses, or by disturbances which affect the sequence of activation of the atria and ventricles. Several drugs currently are used in the treatment of arrhythmias, the most notable including quinidine, procainamide, lidocaine and digitalis.Unfortunately, most if not all of these existing drugs possess undesirable side effects and thus there exists a continuing need for new drugs capable of being used in the treatment of arrhythmias and possessing reduced incidence of undesired side effects. Certain 9 dialkylaminopropyl 9 hydroxyfluorenes have been previously described, see Tor example J. Org. Chem., 26, 2383 92 1961 where such compounds were described as possessing tranquilizing properties.Reference may also be made to U.K. Patent No. 960,758 where this type of tertiary amino derivative is also described as possessing psychotherapeutic properties. It is to be noted that those references do not teach antiarrhythmic activity for this type of compound. According to the present invention there is provided a 9 aminoalkylfluorene of formula I EMI2.1 wherein R1 is hydroxy, cyano, CoNR6R7 in which R6 andR7 are independently hydrogen or C1 C6 alkyl n is an integer from 3 to 5 R2 and R3 are independently hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl, CH2C2 C5 alkenyl or phenyl C1 C3 alkyl, or taken together with the adjacent nitrogen atom form a heterocyclic group containing from 5 to 7 ring atoms and optionally including one further heteroatom selected from oxygen and nitrogen, and which ring is optionally substituted by up to two C1 C4 alkyl groups R4 and R5 are independently hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl or halogen provided that R2 is hydrogen when R1 is hydroxy or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. A preferred class of compounds of formula I are those wherein RÚ is hydroxy, cyano or CONR6R7 in which R6 and R7 are independently hydrogen or C1 C6 alkyl n is 3 or 4 R2 and R are independently hydrogen,C1 C6 alkyl, CH2C2 C5 alkenyl or phenyl C1 C3 alkyl, or taken together represent C4 C5 alkylene or CH2CH2 O CH2CR2 and R4 and 5 are hydrogen. Other preferred compounds of formula I have one or more of the following features 1. n is 3, 2. RÚ is cyano, 3. RÚ is CONH2, 4. Rê is hydrogen and R is C1 C4 alkyl, 5. R2 is hydrogen and R3 is isopropyl, 6. R4 and R5 are hydrogen.The presently most preferred compound is the compound in which RÚ is CONH2, n is 3, Rê is hydrogen, R is isopropyl and R4 and R5 are hydrogen. As stated above also included within this invention are the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I , including the quaternary ammonium salts such as those formed with C1 C6 alkyl alkylating agents when R and R3 are both other than hydrogen. As used herein, the term C1 C6 alkyl refers to both straight and branched chain alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl, nbutyl, iso butyl, tert butyl, n pentyl, iso pentyl, n hexyl, 2 methylbutyl or 2 ethylbutyl. Preferred alkyl groups are C1 C3 alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl and iso propyl. The term CH2C2 C5 alkenyl includes unsaturated carbon chains such as allyl, 2 butenyl, 2pentenyl, 2 hexenyl, 2 methyl 2 pentenyl, 3 hexenyl and 4 methyl 2 pentenyl. Typical examples of phenyl C1 C3 alkyl groups are benzyl, 2 phenethyl and 3 phenylpropyl. R2 and R3 together with the adjacent nitrogen atom may complete a heterocyclic ring containing from 5 to 7 ring atoms. Examples of such groups are the pyrrolidino, piperidino, piperazino and morpholino groups. The compounds of formula I may be prepared by a reducing an aminoalkyne of formula II EMI4.1 b reacting a ketone of formula III EMI4.2 with a Grignard reagent of formula R2R3N CH2 n MgX where X is chlorine, bromine or iodine, to produce a compound of formula I in which R1 is hydroxy c alkylating a compound of formula rV EMI5.1 with an aminoalkylating agent d condensing a compound of formula V EMI5.2 where Q is a leaving group, with an amine of formula HNR2R3 e reacting an amine of formula VI EMI5.3 where X1 is halo or a C1 C4 alkyl ester group, with an amine of formula HNR6R7 or f hydrolyzing a compound of formula I in which R1 is CN to the corresponding primary amide where R1 is CONH2. Compounds of formula II wherein R1is hydroxy can be prepared by reacting a fluoren 9 one with an aminoalkyne in the presence of a strong base which upon hydrogenation affords the corresponding 9aminoalkyl 9 hydroxyfluorene of the invention. This process can be illustrated as follows EMI7.1 The alkynylation can be carried out by combining approximately equimolar amounts of the strong base with the aminoalkyne. Strong bases commonly utilized include alkali metal lower alkyl metalides such as methyl lithium, n butyl lithium, methyl sodium alkali metal amides such as sodium amide, potassium amide and lithium diisopropylamide, as well as alkali metal hydrides such as sodium and potassium hydride.Examples of aminoalkynes which may be used include 3 methylaminopropyne, 4 diethylaminobutyne, 4 pyrrolidinobutyne, 3 isopropylaminopropyne and 3 piperidind propyne and 3 tert butylaminopropyne. Typically the strong base and aminoalkyne are combined in an unreactive organic solvent such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, 1,2 dimethoxyethane or xylene and stirred for about one hour at a reduced temperature of about 40 to about 800C. The compound of formula II in this procedure is then added to the cold reaction mixture and stirring continued at sub zero temperatures for about one hour, after which time the mixture is heated to about 30 to 800C. and stirred for an additional eight to sixteen hours.After the reaction is complete, the mixture is diluted with water, thus decomposing any remaining strong base, and the product extracted into a suitable water immiscible solvent such as diethyl ether or benzene. Removal of the solvent, for instance by evaporation under reduced pressure, provides the corresponding 9 aminoalkynyl 9 R1 fluorene. The compound of formula II thus obtained can be converted to the corresponding 9 aminoalkyl 9 R1 fluorene by hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst such as platinum or palladium on carbon. Such hydrogenation reactions generally are carried out in an inert organic solvent such as ethyl acetate or ethanol, and normally are complete after about two to ten hours when carried out at a hydrogen pressure of about 60 psi.The reduction is preferably effected at a temperature in the range from 250 to 1100C., normally at or about room temperature. The product can be isolated by simply filtering off the catalyst and removing the reaction solvent, for example by evaporation. The product can be further purified if needed by routine methods such as distillation or salt formation. The 9 aminoalkyl 9 hydroxyfluorenes can alternatively be prepared by reaction of fluoren 9one with an aminoalkyl Grignard reagent, i.e. by process alternative b . Grignard reactions are typically effected in ethereal solvents such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran and at temperatures within the range from. 25C to 1100C. Reaction of fluoren 9 one with a Grignard reagent such as 3 diisopropylaminopropyl magnesium chloride affords, after a standard work up and isolation, the corresponding 9 aminoalkyl9 hydroxyfluorene, namely 9 3 diisopropylaminopropyl 9 hydroxyfluorene. The compounds of this invention can also be prepared by process variant c , i.e. by alkylation of a compound of formula IV with an aminoalkyl alkylating agent. Such alkylating agents may be represented by the formula EMI9.1 where A represents a leaving group such as chloro, bromo, iodo, azido or methanesulfonyl. Typical alkylating agents include aminoalkyl halides such as 3 methylaminopropyl chloride, 3 isopropylaminopropyl bromide, 3 diethylaminopropyl iodide, 3 ethylisobutylaminopropyl chloride, 4 isopropylamino butyl iodide and 3 di n hexylaminopropyl bromide. The alkylation reaction can be effected by commingling approximately equimolar quantities of the compound of formula IV and an aminoalkyl alkylating agent in a suitable unreactive solvent such as toluene or benzene and in the presence of about an equimolar quantity of strong base such as sodium amide, lithium amide, nbutyl lithium, sodium methoxide, potassium tertbutoxide or the like.The alkylation normally is substantially complete after about ten to twenty hours when carried out at a temperature from about 300 to about 1000C., although temperatures as high as 1500C. may be utilized. The alkylated fluorene can be isolated by simply diluting the reaction mixture with water and then extracting the product therefrom into a water immiscible solvent such as benzene, diethyl ether or the like. Removal of the solvent then provides the 9cyanofluorene of this invention, which can be further purified if desired by routine methods, including distillation and salt formation. This method is particularly suited for the preparation of compounds where RÚ is cyano but is not always satisfactory for compounds where R1 is hydroxy since such compounds tend to undergo O alkylation. The 9 aminoalkyl 9 cyanofluorenes which can thus be prepared are valuable antiarrhythmic agents, and additionally serve as intermediates leading to the primary 9 carboxamides of this invention, i.e. compounds of the above formula wherein R1 is CONR6R7 andR6 and R7 both are hydrogen. The 9 aminoalkyl 9cyanofluorenes can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding primary carboxamides by reaction with any of a number of acids such as concentrated sulfuric acid, acetic acid, boron trifluoride or dry hydrogen chloride or alternatively by reaction with hydrogen peroxide and a base such as sodium hydroxide, or with manganese dioxide in dichloromethane. The hydrolysis is conveniently effected at a temperature within the range from 20C to 1100C.A preferred hydrolysis process comprises simply heating a solution of the 9 cyanofluorene in sulfuric acid for about one hour at a temperature of about 90 to 1000C. The corresponding primary carboxamide that is formed is readily isolated by making the reaction mixture alkaline, for example by adding sodium hydroxide until the pH reaches about 10, and then extracting the primary carboxamide into a suitable water immiscible solvent such as diethyl ether or benzene. Evaporation of the organic solvent then provides the desired 9 aminoalkyl 9 aminocarbonylfluorene. This compound can be further purified if desired by crystallization or salt formation. Process variant d , i.e. the condensation of the compound of formula V with the amine HNR2R3 is preferably effected by refluxing, or heating under pressure, the formula V compound in the presence of an acid acceptor using excess of the amine as solvent.Q is preferably a halogen atom such as chlorine. The compounds of formula V may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula IV with an alkylating agent of formula Br CH2 O in an inert organic solvent such as toluene or benzene. Compounds of this invention wherein R1 is CONR6R7 7 and one or both of R6 and R7 are alkyl can be prepared by process variant e , ice by reacting a 9 aminoalkyl 9 fluorenyl carboxylic acid halide or lower alkyl ester with a primary or secondary amine of the formula HNR6R7. For example, a fluorenyl carboxylic acid such as 9 3 N benzyl N isopropylamino propyl 9 hydroxycarbonylfluorene can be reacted with oxalyl chloride to give the corresponding acid chloride, namely 9 3 N benzyl N isopropylaminopropyl 9 chloro carbonylfluorene. Reaction of the latter compound with an amine such as methyl amine affords the corresponding methyl substituted carboxamide, namely 9 3 N benzyl N isopropylaminopropyl 9 methylaminocarbonylfluorene. The substituted carboxamides of the invention can alternatively be prepared by reacting a substituted amine with an ester of a fluorene 9 carboxylic acid. This method is similar to that described in U.S. Patent 3,660,485. For example, an ester such as 9 3 ethylaminopropyl 9 methoxycarbonylfluorene can be reacted with an excess of an amine such as isopropylamine in a suitable solvent such as toluene to provide the corresponding carboxamide, namely 9 3 ethylamino propyl 9 isopropylaminocarbonylfluorene. Primary or secondary amines of formula I can be alkylated, if desired. Such a process is depicted by the following scheme EMI12.1 in which n, RÚ, Rê und R have the above defined meanings, and Xê is a leaving group such as halogen.Alkylation of primary amines is well known in the art and typically is carried out by combining the amine and alkylating agent in the presence of a base such as sodium bicarbonate or triethylamine to act as an acid scavenger. The reactions normally are carried out in organic solvents such as toluene, dimethylsulfoxide, ethanol or methanol. As an illustration of the process, a fluorene derivative such as 9 3 aminopropyl 9cyanofluorene can be mixed with about an equimolar quantity of an alkylating agent such as allyl bromide in a solvent such as benzene and in the presence of triethylamine. The reaction mixture can be heated to about 500C. and stirred for about two hours to provide the corresponding alkylated aminopropylfluorene derivative wherein Rê is allyl, namely 9 3 allyolaminopropyl 9cyanofluorene.Further alkylation of this secondary amine with yet a different alkylating agent, for exampleR3X2 wherein R3 is benzyl, affords the corresponding tertiary amine, namely 9 3 N allyl N benzylaminopropyl 9 cyanofluorene. It should be at once recognized that hydrolysis of the cyano moiety as hereinabove discussed provides the corresponding 9 carboxamide derivative. Various of the compounds provided by this invention are useful as intermediates in addition to being valuable antiarrhythmic agents. For example, theN benzyl aminoalkylfluorenes of the above formula can be de benzylated by hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium. Similarly, N methyl aminoalkylfluorenes can be de methylated. For example, a compound such as 9 4 N n propyl N methylaminobutyl 9 cyanofluorene can be reacted with a haloformate such as phenyl chloroformate to form a carbamate, which when reacted with alkali is hydrolyzed to the corresponding secondary amine, namely 9 4 N n propylaminobutyl 9cyanofluorene. The latter compound is a potent antiarrhythmic agent, and additionally can be utilized as an intermediate in the preparation of other antiarrhythmic agents. Ester and carboxylic acid analogues of the compounds of formula I , i.e. compounds in which R1 isCO2R8 where R8 is hydrogen or C1 C4 alkyl, have also been found to possess antiarrythmic properties. They can be prepared by generating the anion of a compound of formula EMI14.1 where neither of R2 and R3 are hydrogen, with a strong base such as sodium hydride and then reacting the anion thus formed with a C1 C4 alkyl haloformate, preferably a C1 C4 alkyl chloroformate such as ethyl chloroformate. The reaction is preferably effected in an aprotic solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide. If it is desired to prepare a compound of formula I in which one or both of R2 and R3 are hydrogen then the amino group should first be protected by readily removable groups such as methyl or benzyl, which groups are then removed to yield the desired compound. Esters of formula I can be hydrolyzed by aqueous bases to yield the corresponding acid R1 is COOH .These acids may also be formed by acid hydrolysis of the corresponding.nitriles. The compounds provided by this invention are basic in nature by virtue of the nitrogen atom of the 9 aminoalkyl substituent. Such compounds consequently react with a number of acids to form salts. This invention additionaly provides pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds defined by the above general formula, which are those salts which add no substantial toxicity to the free base from which they are derived. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thus provided are prepared by reacting a 9 aminoalkylfluorene of this invention with any of a number of acids. Inorganic acids commonly utilized include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulfuric, nitric, perchloric and similar acids.Organic acids frequently utilized to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include acetic,succinic, maleic, methanesulfonic, citric, fumaric, para toluenesulfonic, and related organic acids. Additionally provided herein are the lower alkyl quaternary ammonium salts which can be prepared when R2 and R3 in the formula I are both other than hydrogen. For example, normal alkylation of a tertiary amine such as 9 3 N methyl N isopropylaminopropyl 9 aminocarbonylfluorene by reaction with a lower C1 C6 alkylating agent such as methyl chloride, ethyl bromide, n butyl iodide or isohexyl bromide affords the corresponding quaternary ammonium salt. Such salts characteristically are highly crystalline solids and can be purified by recrystallization from solvents such as ethanol or water. The following compounds are representative of those comprehended by this invention. 9 3 isopropylaminopropyl 9 hydroxyfluorene 9 4 isopropylaminobutyl 9 hydroxyfluorene 9 3 n hexylaminopropyl 9 hydroxyfluorene 9 3 tert butylaminopropyl 9 hydroxyfluorene hydrobromide 9 3 2 butenylamino propyl 9 hydroxyfluorene 9 4 2 phenylethylamino butyl 9 hydroxyfluorene 9 3 isopropylaminopropyl 9 cyanofluorene 9 3 benzylaminopropyl 9 cyanofluorene 9 4 allylaminobutyl 9 cyanofluorene 9 3 3 phenylpropylamino propyl 9 cyanofluorene 9 4 N isopropyl N ethylaminobutyl 9cyanofluorene 9 3 N,N diisopropylaminopropyl 9 cyano fluorene 9 3 N isopropyl N 2 phenylethylaminopropyl 9 cyanofluorene 9 3 3 hexenylamino propyl 9 cyanofluorene, 9 4 diethylaminobutyl 9 cyanofluorene 9 3 isopropylaminopropyl 9 cyanofluorene hydrosulfate 9 3 dibenzylaminopropyl 9 cyanofluorene ethyl iodide 9 3 n pentylaminopropyl 9 aminocarbonyl fluorene 9 3 isopropylaminopropyl 9 aminocarbonylfluorene hydrophosphate 9 3 N methyl N tert butylaminopropyl 9 aminocarbonylfluorene 9 4 2 hexenylamino butyl 9 aminocarbonyl fluorene 9 3 n 2 phenylethyl N isobutylaminopropyl 9 aminocarbonylfluorene 9 3 N,N di n hexylaminopropyl 9 aminocarbonylfluorene 9 3 N 2 methylpentyl N ethylaminopropyl 9 aminocarbonylfluorene 9 3 N benzyl N isobutylaminopropyl 9 aminocarbonylfluorene n propyl iodide 9 3 isopropylaminopropyl 9 aminocarbonylfluorene hydroacetate 9 3 isopropylaminopropyl 9 methylaminocarbonylfluorene 9 4 diethylaminobutyl 9 dimethylaminocarbonylfluorene 9 3 isopropylaminopropyl 9 isopropylaminocarbonylfluorene hydrochloride 9 4 benzylaminobutyl 9 di n butylaminocar bonylfluorene 9 3 allylaminopropyl 9 n hexylaminocarbonylfluorene 9 4 morpholinobutyl 9 aminocarbonylfluorene 9 3 piperidinopropyl 9 cyanofluorene 9 3 aminopropyl 9 ethylaminocarbonylfluorene 9 3 diisopropylaminopropyl 9 diisopropyl aminocarbonylfluorene methiodide and 9 3 N 2 butenyl N 2 hexenyl aminopropyl 9 aminocarbonylfluorene. The 9 aminoalkylfluorenes provided by this invention are useful as antiarrhythmic agents. This utility has been demonstrated by evaluating representative compounds of the invention in biological assays designed to measure antiarrhythmic activity. One such assay comprises administering a compound of unknown biological activity to a dog suffering from an experimentally induced cardiac arrhythmia, and observing whether or not the compound effects a conversion of the arrhythmia to a normal sinus rhythm, and if so, for how long the conversion persists. In a typical experiment to determine the activity of the compounds of this invention, one or more mongrel dogs of either sex were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. A 23 gauge Butterfly infusion needie was placed in the radial vein for the introduction into the dog of sufficient ouabain to induce an arrhythmia, and for the introduction into the dog of the test compound. Each dog was continuously monitored throughout the experiment by an electrocardiogram.After the ouabain induced cardiac arrhythmia had continued for thirty minutes, a compound of formula I was administered via the Butterfly infusion needle at the rate of 200 pg per kilogram of dog body weight per minute. If the arrhythmia was not converted to a normal sinus rhythm within ten minutes from the initial administration of test compound, as observed by the electrocardiogram, the rate of infusion of test compound was increased to 500 pg per kilogram per minute.The amount of test compound required to convert an arrhythmia to normal rhythm was recorded as the converting dose . Following the complete administration of test compound to the dog, the dog s heart was monitored by electrocardiogram until such time that an arrhythmia returned to the dog s heart, or for a maximum time of two hours, at which time the experiment was terminated. The duration of normal rhythm was recorded in minutes. The results of several experiments are set out in the following table. Most of the compounds were evaluated more than once, as indicated in the No. ofDogs column. The average converting dose is given in mg. per kilogram of animal body weight. Average duration of conversion is recorded in minutes.

Parenteral administration of the compounds can be accomplished by intraperitoneal, subcutaneous or intravenous injection.The compounds alternatively can be administered orally in the form of tablets, capsules, elixirs, syrups, buccal seals and the like, and in one embodiment of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation which comprises a compound of formula I or an analogue in which R1 is CO2R8 where R8 is hydrogen or C1 C4 alkyl, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, associated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier there for. The aminoalkylfluorenes of this invention have good antiarrhythmic activity both therapeutically, for instance when administered to an animal suffering from an arrhythmia and in need of treatment, and prophylactically when administered to an animal suspected of developing an arrhythmia, thereby protecting the animal against the occurrence or recurrence of arrhythmias. As stated above, the compounds of the invention generally will be utilized as pharmaceutical formulations.Such formulations ideally contain from about 1 to about 50 percent by weight of the aminoalkylfluorene in combination with a suitable diluent, excipient or carrier therefor. Diluents commonly utilized in formulating the compounds in solid form suitable for oral administration include starch, lactose, gelatin, silica gel, rice flour, carboxymethyl cellulose and the like.Carriers employed in liquid formulations suitable for parenteral administration via the intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous routes include water, saline, glucose syrup, ethanol, corn oil and the like. The 9 aminoalkylfluorenes of this invention can be administered to a subject suffering from an arrhythmia and in need of treatment, or to a subject suspected of developing an arrhythmia and in need of prophylactic treatment. Parenteral administration may be preferred for subjects suffering from a lifethreatening arrhythmia. Oral administration generally is preferred for maintenance or prophylactic treatment.The compounds ideally are formulated in such a way that the effective dose of 9 aminoalkylfluorene is an amount sufficient to treat the arrhythmia. Such doses typically will be from 0.05 to 25 mg. kg. A typical oral dose for the treatment of a patient suffering from an arrhythmia will be, for example, from 1 to 200 mg.of a suitably formulated aminoalkylfluorene, for instance 9 isopropylaminopropyl 9 aminocarbonylfluorene, preferably as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt such as the hydrochloride salt. Oral dosing may be made from 1 to 4 times each day, or as dictated by the particular patient and condition being treated. The fluorene can of course be formulated for parenteral administration, for instance by intravenous infusion.Such formulations can be prepared by dissolving about 500 mg. of the above noted compound in a suitable diluent such as 1000 ml. of 5 percent glucose. The solutions thus formed can be infused at the rate of about 1 ml. per minute into a patient suffering from an arrhythmia. The invention will now be further illustrated by the following non limiting Examples. Example 1 9 3 Isopropylaminopropyl 9 hydroxyfluorene A solution of 9.0 g. of fluoren 9 one dissolved in 500 ml. of tetrahydrofuran was added dropwise over one hour to a stirred cold 800C. solution of 500 ml. of tetrahydrofuran containing 9.7 g. of 3 iso propylaminopropyne and 75 ml. of a 1.6 molar tetrahydrofuran solution of n butyl lithium.
