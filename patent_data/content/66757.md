# An apparatus for discharging radioactive waste from its container.

## Abstract
An apparatus for discharging radioactive waste 25 from its container comprises a truck movable toward and away from the container 1 by means for driving means 22 , seizing means including claws 5 capable of closing and opening to seize and release the radioactive waste little by little, a cylinder 12 connected to the seizing means for closing and opening the claws, a further cylinder 16 for tilting the seizing means downwardly to eject the seized waste and a detector 17 for detecting pressure caused by the seizing means penetrating into the waste when the truck 4 is driven toward the container 1 by the driving means 22 to produce signals for stopping the truck 4 and operating the first mentioned cylinder 12 to close the claws. The apparatus safely and securely discharges little by little the radioactive waste filled in the storage container 1 without any risk of exposing operators to the radioactive radiation emitted from the waste, thereby saving time and labor and making easy next processes for burning it.
