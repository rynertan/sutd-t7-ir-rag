# Circuit arrangement comprising at least two high voltage power switches connected in series.

## Abstract
In order to ensure that the switches T₁D₁ T₂D₂ are auto matically cut off substantially simultaneously, the control means of each switch comprise a delay element Dy₁, Dy₂ for delaying the cut off signal, a comparison stage Cp control ling the delay caused by at least one delay element as a func tion of the difference between the voltage present at the junc tion point A of the switches and a reference voltage V₂ .
