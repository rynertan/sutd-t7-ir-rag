## Abstract
A process for forming a copolymer of styrene and buta diene in which an aqueous mixture comprising water, styrene monomer, butadiene monomer, a suspension stabilizing agent, and a chain propagating amount of a free radical poly merization initiator insoluble in water, soluble in the styrene monomer and soluble in the butadiene monomer is heated in an inert atmosphere to a temperature between about 50 C and about 130 C in the absence of redox initiators and mercaptan compounds until the monomers form an aqueous suspension of discrete copolymer particles having a Tg value of between about 45 C and 65 C and a weight average molecular weight of between about 10,000 and about 250,000. Increased molecular weight distribution of the final copolymer may be achieved by introducing additional styrene monomer, butadiene monomer, suspension stabilizing agent and initiator to the aqueous mix ture at least once during the heating step. Optimum yields are achieved by heating the aqueous mixture with at least two dif ferent initiators in accordance with a predetermined multistage heating profile.

## Description
AOUEOUS SUSPENSION LYMERIZADONI PROCESS This invention relates to an aqueous polymerization process for forming a suspension of discrete copolymer particles of serene and butadiene. The development of electrostatic latent images with toner particles is well knows. The level of sophistication achieved for electrostatic latent image development systems over the years has been most remarkable. For example, slow and laborous manual systems commercialized in the late 1950s have evolved into elegant high speed development systems which spew out as many as two copies per second. Consequently, the performance standards for toners during the evolution of electrostatography have become increasingly stringent In the early manual development systems, tone. and carrier particles were merely moved over an imaging surface bearing an electrostatic latent image by hand, tilting a tray containing the imaging surface and toner and carrier particles.However, in recent years, toner particles are automatically recycled many thousands of times over imaging surfaces moving at extremely high velocites Thus durable toner materials are required to withstand the physical punishment of vigorous, prolonged and continuous use. Moreover, toner particles deposited in image configuration must now be fused in extremely short periods of time. Due to the size limitations of electrostatic copying and duplicating machines, the fusing path must be relatively short When one attempts to increase the heat energy applied to deposited toner images for fusing purposes within the constraints of a limited fusing path to achieve adequate fixing at higher rates, one approaches the charing or kindling temperature of the substrate bearing the toner image.Attempts to shorten the fusing path by utilizing flash fusing techniques often result in the formation of noxious fumes due to decomposition of components in some toners. Further, the cost and availability of energy to operate an electrostatographic imaging system is of increasing concern to uses in addition, toner materials must possess the proper triboelectric charging properties for electrostatic latent image development and must not agtlomerate during storage and transportation. Thus, there is a great need for an improved toner having stable electrical and physical properties which can endure the harsh environment of high speed electrostatographic copiers and duplicators and which can also be fused at lower energy levels. Many attempts have been made to formulate polymers which meet the demanding requirements of modem high speed copiers and duplicators.One polymer which is being developed to exhibit properties which can meet the stringent standards of advanced copiers and duplicators is a very specific copolymer of styrene and butadiene having a limited ratio of styrene to butadie,ne moiees, a well defined minimum glass transition temperature Tg and a carefully controlled weight average molecular weight Mw range. Copolymers of styrene and butadiene may be made by various techniques. Emulsion polymerization is the most popular polymerization process. However, emulsion polymerization processes have a number of drawbacks including complicated and difficult to control coagulation operations necessary to separate the solid polymer from the latex produced during the emulsion polymerization process. Further, such polymerization processes result in undesirable residual contaminants used to carry out the emulsion polymerzariorL In addition, emulsion polymerization techniques can be relatively expensive due to the complex processing steps required to form and separate the polymers. Attempts have been made to polymerize copolymers of styrene butadiene in an aqueous medium to form styrene butadiene copolymer particles. Examples of these techniques are illustrated in U.S. Patent 2,836,584, U.S. Patent 4,169,828 and U.S. Patent 4,170,699. Unfortunately, these processes have attendant disadvantages when used to make toner resins. For example, the process of US Patent 2 836 584 requires polyvinyl alcohol to prevent the formation of a latex, a redox type polymerization initiator or catalyst, and a long chain mercaptan to control the physical properties of the copolymer. Further, materials containing mercaptans emit hydrogen sulfide into the atmosphere and the sulfurous compounds are absorbed by paper substrates during flash fusing due to the decomposition of the mercaptan.The odor of hydrogen sulfide in xerographic copies redners such consumer products unacceptable. The polymerization processes described in US Patents 4 169 828 and 4 170 699 require the presence of a bisulfite or persulfate modifier in the presence of an adjunct modifier such as amino acids or glutamic acid which adversely affect the electrical properties of electrostatic toners prepared with these materials. Accordipgly, there continues to be a need for an improved and more effective aqueous polymerization process for forming a suspension of distinct styrene butadiene copolymer particles which may readily be separated from the reaction medium by mere filtration. There also continues to be a need for a polymerization process which will provide toner polymers possessing properties necessary to meet the demanding requirements of modern high speed electrostatographic imaging systems. The present invention is intended to provide an aqueous polymerization process for forming distinct suspended particles of copolymers of styrene and butadiene which overcomes the above noted disadvantages. According to the invention there is provided a process for forming a copolymer of styrene and butadiene characterised by preparing an aqueous mixture comprising water, styrene monomer, butadiene monomer, a suspension stabilizing agent, and a chain propogating amount of a free radical polymerization initiator insoluble in water, soluble in said styrene monomer, soluble in said butadiene monomer and having a 1 hour half life between about 500C and about 1300 C, the ratio of said styrene monomer and said butadiene monomer being between about 80 20 and about 95 5 by weight, and heating said aqueous mixture in an inert atmospher to a temperature between about 500C and about 130 C in the absence of redox initiators and mercaptan compounds until at least about 90 percent by weight of said styrene monomer and said butadiene monomer are copolymerized to form an aqueous suspension of discrete copolymer particles having a Tg value of between about 48 C and about 65 C and a weight average molecular weight of between about 10,000 and about 250,000. The process of the invention provides an aqueous polymerization process for forming copolymers of styrene and butadiene which do not emit mercaptan, hydrogen sulphide or other undesirable compounds during thermal fusing of toner images. The invention also provides an aqueous polymerization process for forming copolymers of styrene and butadiene that minimizes electrostatographically undesirable components. The aqueous polymerization process of the invention forms copolymers of styrene and butadiene with short reaction periods, and with molecular properties which impart improved fixing properties to toners.The process also minimizes the amount of residual monomer in the final copolymer product. Increased molecular weight distribution of the final copolymer may be achieved by introducing an additional mixture of styrene monomer, butadiene monomer, suspension stabilizing agent and initiator to the aqueous mixture at least once during the heating step. The additional initiator is added in a different proportion relative to the new charge of monomer compared to the original aqueous mixture. Optimum yields and minimum residual monomer content are achieved by heating the aqueous mixture with at least two different initiators in accordance with a predetermined multistage heating profile. The different initiators are added in different propomons relative to each other. Any suitable styrene monomer or polymerizable styrene derivative may be employed in the polymerization process of this invention Typical polymerizable styrene derivatives include alpha methyl styrene, vinyl tolu ene, ethyl styrene, monochloroswrene, dichiorostyrene, alkoxystyrenes such as paramethoxy styrene and the like. Styrene is preferred because of its low cost and availablility. The other monomeric reactant employed in the process of this invention is L3 butadiene. The preferred ratio of the styrene monomer to butadiene monomer reactants is between about 80 20 and about 95 5 by weight Excessively low ratios of styrene monomer tend to cause a decrease of the Tg which will lead to unacceptably low toner resin blocking temperatures and agglomeration of toner particles obtained from such resins. Unduly high ratios of styrene monomer result in copolymers with high softening temperatures and lead to toners requiring high fixing temperatures and high fixing energy. Any suitable chain propagating amount of a free radical polymerization initiator insoluble in water, soluble in the styrene monomer and soluble in the butadiene monomer, may be employed in the process of this invention Typical monomer soluble free radical polymerization initiators include lauroyl peroxide, benioyl peroxide, acetyl peroxide, decanoylperoxide, azo bis isobutyronitrile, t butylperbenzoate, t butyl ethylhexyl monoperoxycarbonate, peroxy di carbonates, 2,2 azo bis 2,4dim ethyl l 4 methoxyvaleronitrile , 2,2 azo bis 2A dim ethylvaleronitrile and mixtures thereof.Optimum results are achieved with peroxides, peroxycarbonates, peroxybenzoates, azonitrile free radical polymerization initiators and the like. These free radical polymerization initiators should possess a half life of about 1 hour, at temperatures between about 50 C and about 13000 in order to effect adequate polymerization at reaction temperatures between about 500C and about 1300C for reaction times of less than about 8 hours. Satisfactory results may be achieved when the reaction mixture comprises from about 0.05 percent to about 63 percent by weight of the free radical polymerization initiator based on a total weight of the styrene monomer and butadiene monomer.A range of about 0.1percent to about 6 percent by weight of the free radical polymerization initiator is preferred because it provides an acceptable rate of polymerization and leads to the sthesis of copolymers with molecular properties which enable toners containing these copolymers to melt at low temperatures. Too high a concentration leads to too low a molecular weight Reaction time is excessive when the concentration of initiator less than about 0.05 percent Moreover, the suspension becomes unstable and produces polymers having unduly high molecular weight when the initiator concentration is too low.The rate of thermal decomposition of the free radical polymerization initiator at the reaction temperatures is important in order to lead to an acceptable rate of polymerization and at high conversion to provide sufficient time for diffusion of the free radical species formed to the reactive monomers. Any suitable suspension stabilizing agent may be utilized in the aqueous reaction mixture of this inventio i Preferably, the suspension stabilizing agent is a finely divided, difficultly water soluble powder, such as tricalcium phosphate, barium phosphate, aluminum phosphate, zinc phosphate, magnesium phosphate, bentonite, talk and the like. The amount of suspension stabilizing agent that may be used ranges from about 0.05 percent to about 6.0 percent by weight, based on total weight of the styrene monomer and butadiene monomer. A range of suspension stabilizing agent of from about 0.05 percent to about 4.0 percent is preferred because it assures a stable suspension of copolymer particles. An ionic surfactant may be utilized to disperse the suspension stabilizing agent. Excellent results have been achieved with sodium alkyl naphthalene sulfonate Alkanol XC, available from E.I. duPont deNemours Co. which aids suspension stabilizing agents such as tricalcium phosphate to more effectively stabilize the suspension. Other suitable ionic surfactants can be used for this purpose. Typical ionic surfactants include sodium oleate, dodecylbenzene sodium sulphonate, sodium tetradecyl sulphate and the like. The ionic surfactant should be present in an amount between about 0.2 percent and about 4 percent by weight based on the total weight of the suspension stabilizing agent. The amount of water employed in the polymerization process of this invention may be varied but for reasons of heat transfer and monomer and polymer handling, a water to combined styrene monomer and butadiene monomer weight proportion is preferably between about 1 1 and about 2 1.When the amount of water is less than about 1 1, it becomes difficult to avoid agglomeration of the suspended copolymer particles under reaction conditions. When more than a 2 1 ratio is utilized, the low yield of copolymer tends to become commercially unattractive. The reaction should be conducted in an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, argon and the like. Moreoever, the polymerization reaction should be conducted in a closed system to avoid loss of gaseous butadiene and conducted at a pressure of between about 1.4 and about 9.8 Kg. cam 2, and more preferably between about 2.8 and about 7.0 Kg. cam 2 to drive the monomers into the reactor against back pressure of flashed butadiene.Lower pressures would be insufficient to force the monomers into the reactor and higher pressures would require specially designed and expensive reactors. Stirring of the reaction mixture during heating is highly desirable in order to avoid agglomeration of the suspended copolymer particles and to disperse the heat of reactor Any suitable conventional technique may be utilized. Typical agitation systems include mechanical stirring blades, magnetic mixers, ultrasonic agitators, and the like. It is recommended that due to the explosive hazard presented by butadiene, air motors or explosion proof electric motors be utilized for driving mechanical stirrers, The polymerization temperature will be dependent to some extent upon the half life of the free radical polymerization initiator and the weight ratio of water to monomer utilized. Generally, a temperature between about 500C and about 1300C is satisfactory.Temperatures lower than about 500C usually require undesirable long reaction times. Temperatures above about 1300C affect the macromolecular structure and the molecular properties of the product The double bonds at high reaction temperatures can induce or accelerate undesirable branching, grafting, crosslinking and the like. Reactive free radical initiators may be employed at temperatures of about 500C whereas higher temperatures should be used for less reactive free radical polymerization initiators. The temperature may be raised to a single preselected level and thereafter maintained for a preselected reaction time.Reaction temperatures of less than about 1000C reduce further the likelihood of affecting the butadiene configuration in the copolymerization macromolecule and inducing branching and the like. Reaction temperatures above about 10000 reduce the residual unpolymerized monomers and increases the yield of the reactions. It has been found that significant reduction of the residual styrene monomer in the final reaction product may be achieved by heating the aqueous mixture in accordance with a predetermined heating profile involving heating the aqueous mixture to a fis temperature between about 5000 and less than about 1000C, maintaining the first temperature until substantial thermolitic dissociation of at least one free radical polymerization initiator occurs and thereafter raising the temperature of the aqueous reaction mixture to at least a second temperature greater than about 900C and less than about 130 C, but at least 1500 greater than the first temperature, and maintaining the second temperature for a sufficient period of time to achieve substantial thermolitic dissociation of a second free radical polymerization initiator. By substantial thermolitic dissociation, it is intended to meant that at least about 50 percent based on the initial charge of the free radical polymerization initiator actually dissociates Preferably, a free radical polymerization initiator employed in the first heating stage of this multistage heating process should have a one hour half life temperature between about 500C and 10000. Typical free radical polymerizaion initiators ha ing g one hour half life temperatures in this range include benzoyl peroxide, 91 C , lauroyl peroxide, 80 C , acetyl peroxide, 87 C , di n propyl peroxydicarbonate, 66 C , diisopropyl peroxycarbonate, 67 C , di sec butyl peroxydicarbonate, 67 C , di 2ethylhexyl peroxydicarbonate, 67 C , di 2 phenoxyethyl peroxydicarbonate, 67 C , 2,2 azobis isobutyronitrile , 82 C , 2,2 azo bis 2,4 dimethyl 4 methoxyaleronitrile , 48 C , 2,2 azo bis 2,4dimethylvaleronitrile , 68 C , 2 t butylazo 2 cyanopropanol, 97 C , 2 tbutylazo 2 cyano 4 methoxy 4 methylpetane 87 C , and the like. Preferably, a free radical polymerization initiator employed in the second heating stage of this multistage heating process should have a one hour half life temperature between about 900C and 13000. Typical free radical polymerization initiators which have a half life temperatures in this range include 00 t butyl 0 2 ethyIhexyl monopropoxycarbonate, t butyl peroxybenzoate, t butylperoxy 2 ethylhexanoate 92 C , t butylperoxy maleic acid 110 C , 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di benzylperoxy hexane 118 C , 1 cyano 1 t butyl azo cyclohexane 117 C , and the like. The initiator for the second heating stage should be substantially inactive at the one hour half life temperature of the initiator for the first heating stage. This requires a difference of at least about 1500 between the half life temperatures of the two initiators.Since some of the initiators listed for the first heating step have a one hour half life temperature greater than about 1500 than the one hour half life temperature of other initiators listed for the first heating stage, these former initiators may be used together with the latter initiators during the first heating step with the former initiators having the higher one hour half life acting as initiators for the second heating stage For example, di n propyl peroxy dicarbonate may be used with 2 t buty azo 2 canopropanoL Satisfactory results may be achieved when about 0.05 percent to about 6.5 percent by weight of initiator based on the total weight of the monomers are utilized in the first heating stage and when about 0.08 percent to about 0.3 percent by weight of the initiator based on the total weight of the initial monomers is utilized in at least the second heating stage. The first primary initiator level is chosen so as to achieve the desired molecular weight The second finishing initiator level is chosen to achieve the desired residual monomer leveL However, the two initiator levels are not mutually exclusive. The second initiator can affect the molecular weight of the polymers and the primary initiator level can indirectly affect the residual monomer leveL The prudent choice of initiator levels and temperature profile controls the final molecular properties. The reaction time for effecting polymerization of the styrene and butadiene copolymer is also dependent to some extend upon the half life of the free radical polymerization initiator and the weight ratio of water to monomer utilized. Moreover, the reaction time also depends upon the weight average molecular weight desired in the final copolymer productRegardless of whether temperature is raised only to a single preselected level or a single reaction period or to multiple levels for multiple reaction periods, the overall reaction time for the process of this invention is relatively short and is normally less than about 8 hours.However, the reaction time should be sufficiently long to achieve a styrene and butadiene copolymer weight average molecular weight between about 10,000 and about 250,000 for ideal toner resin properties in high speed electrostatographic copiers and duplicators. Suitable profiles for the multistage heating profile embodiment of this invention may be determined by considering the half life characterittics of the initiators. The lower temperature region must be sufficiently long to polymerize the bulk of the monomer both for energy efficiency and suspension stability. The time for the upper temperature reaction is chosen to be as short as possible while adhiezg the desired reduction in residual monomer content of the final product and controlling the final Mw.Thus the desired temperature profile may be readily determined by conducing dme temperahlre reactions and measurement of the polymer propertiesAnother variable is the length of time spent moving from one temperature to another the ramp and this is generally kept as short as possible for the reactor system with a time allowance for the remaining first stage initiator to decompose in a non explosive fashion The multistage heating profile embodiment of this invention has been found to be capable of reducing the residual monomer in the final resin product to as low as about 0.05 percent by weight based on the total weight of the copolymer product Residual monomer content in the final copolymer product should be minimized to avoid a reduction of the blocking temperature and undesirable environmental effects produced when the resin is subjected to fusing conditions in electrostatographic copiers and duplicators. Generally, for multistage heating profiles, it is desirable that between about 70 percent and about 95 percent by weight of the total monomer mixture be polymerized in the first heating stage to about the molecular weight desired and thereafter heated to one or more subsequent stages to polymerize the residual monomer remaining in the compositip The multistage heanng profile permits the use of smaller amounts of active free radical polymerization initiators in the one or more heating stages following the first heating stage.It is believed that the one or more subsequent heating stages promotes more effective diffusion of the initiator to the monomers for more complete polymerdation. The multistage heating profile embodiment also provides optimum molecular weight disvibutiom Molecular weight distribution MWD is defined as the ratio between the weight average molecular weight Mw and the number average molecular weight my . Further, polymers characterized by broad molecular weight distribution exhibit a larger fusing temperature range which compensates for significantly greater temperature fluctuations thereby permitting a larger operating latitude for electrostatographic fusing systems. For purposes of comparison, the multistage heating profile embodiment can provide copolymers having a molecular weight dismbution up to about 9 whereas the simple single stage heating process embodiment provides toner resins having a molecular weight distribution between about 2 and about 5. Improved molecular weight distnbution may also be achieved by means of a multiple injection embodiment wherein additional styrene monomer, butadiene monomer, radical initiator and suspension stabilizing agent is introduced into the aqueous mixture at least once during the heating step. If desired, the suspension stabilizing agent may be introduced prior to, simultaneously with or subsequent to the introduction of the other components. Optimum results are achieved when the additional serene monomer, butadiene monomer and free radical initiator are introduced approximately mid way between the initiation and termination of the heating step. The proportions of the additional styrene monomer and butadiene monomer is between about 80 20 and about 95 5 by weightToner polymers produced by the multiple injection embodiment have molecular weight disriutions between about 2.0 and about 8.0. Generally, the initial charge of styrene monomer and butadiene monomer comprises about 40 to 70 percent by weight of the total charge of styrene monomer and butadiene monomer utilized in the polneritatiorl process.The additional styrene and butadiene monomers are preferably added to the reaction to maximize the molecular weight distributiom The percent by weight of additional initiator based on the weight of additional styrene and butadiene monomers is preferably between about 12 and about 2 times the percent by weight of initiator employed for the first charge. In other words, if 3 percent by weight of initiator based on the weight of the of the monomers in the first charge is employed in the first charge, 3.6 to 6 percent by weight of initiator based on the weight of the monomers in the additional charge should be used for the additional charge.Since the timing of the additional charge depends upon factors such as the proportions of reactants, specific initiator, temperatures and the like, trial runs may be conducted with different addition times to select the addition time that provides the largest molecular weight distribution in the final copolymer product The additional charge should be sufficiently early to acheive polymerization of at least about 90 percent of the monomers in the second charge. If desired, the steps of the multistage heating profile embodiment and multiple injection embodiment may be combined In this mse, the second monomer injection and the high temperature initiator can be introduced immediately prior to the second heating stage of the multistage heating profile embodiment In comparing the single stage heating single injection embodiment, the multiple injection embodiment and the multiple initiators with a multistage heating profile embodiment, the residual styrene monomer in the final copolymer product can be reduced to as low as about 0.5 percent by weight based on the total weight of the copolymer when utilizing tne single injection process, as low as about 1 percent by weight based on the total weight of the copolymer product in the multiple injection embodiment, and as low as about 0.05 percent by weight with the multiple initiators with multistage heating profile embodiment Thus, the multiple injection embodiment with improved molecular weight distribution is a preferred embodiment and the multiple initiators with multistage heating profile embodiment with its greater molecular weight distribution and siglificantly lower residual styrene monomer is considered the optimum embodiment A combination of the multiple injection with multiple initiators and multistage heating may be preferable in special cases when exceptionally broad MWD and low residual monomer are desired The following examples further specifically define the present invention with respect to the copolymer polymerization process and the improved copolymer obtained by means of the process Percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated The examples below are intended to illustrate various control examples and various preferred embodiments of the instant invention All of the reactions of the following specific examples were carried out in a stainless steel Parr 300 ml Pressure Reactor having an interior diameter of 6.3 cm, depth of 9.7 em and a volume of 300 ml. It was equipped with an internal cooling coil, thermocouple and a four bladed turbine stirrer. The reactor head contained a pressure gage, and inlets for gas and reactants.A condensor was employed to prevent loss of water during an initial flushing of the reactor with nitrogen to remove oxygen prior to the addition of the monomers. Cooling was effected by means of a cooling coil through which cold water was circulated Heating was effected by means of a heating jacket ECtHPLE I A pressure reactor was charged with about 80 milliliters of de ionized water, 1.65 grams of tncalcium phosphate, and 0.25 gram of an alkylsodium napthalene sulfonate Alkanol XC available from E I. duPont de Nemours and Company.The reactor head was then secured to the reactor and the reactor was flushed with purified nitrogen introduced while the reactor was heated to 850C with stirring at about 200 rpm. The condensor prevented loss of water carried by the exiting nitrogen As the reactor was heated, 2.96 grams of benzoyl peroxide and about 54 grams of styrene were mixed together and introduced into a stainless steel cylinder equipped with valves at both ends. About 6.7 grams s of 1,3 butadiene was then introduced into the stainless steel cylinder.The condensor on the reactor was thereafter quickly replaced by the cylinder, the pressure reactor was closed to the atmosphere, and the nitrogen flow terminated The monomers were introduced in a liquid phase under nitrogen pressure of about 80 psi to the stirred aqueous medium An increase in the reactor pressure was noted and the temperanire was raised to about 900C.The copolymerization reaction was carried out for about S hours at a maximum pressure of about 80 psiThe reactor was then cooled to room temperature and venK The resulting white, uniform polymer beads were washed with L0 N HNO3, then with water, coDected by filtration and dried The resulting copolymer had a Mn of about 13,000 a Mw of about 49,000, a MWD of about 3.77 and a residual styrene content of less than about L49 percent based on the total weight of the copolymer. EXAMPLE II The procedure of Example I was repeated using about 120 milliliters of de ionized water, about 39 milligrams of an organosodium sulfonate Alkanol XC , about 2.48 grams of tricalcium phosphate, about 54.6 grams of styrene monomer, various amounts of butadiene monomer and various amounts of benzoyl peroxide as listed in Table I below. The temperature of the reaction for various concentrations of the polmerizafon initiator are also listed in the table below to illustrate the effect of temperature and quantity of initiator on molecular weight distribution.

EXAMPLE III The procedures of Example I were repeated with about 120 milliliters of de ionized water, about 2.48 grams of tricalcium phosphate, about 0.039 gram of an organosodium naphthalene sulfonate Alkanol XC , about 033 grams of benzoyl peroxide, about 27 grams of styrene monomer and about 3.6 grams of 1,3 butadiene monomer. The temperature of the reactor was raised to about 900C and maintained at that temperature for about 5 hours. However, LS hours after the temperature was raised to 900C, 15 grams of tricalcium phosphate was added using a Catalyst Addition Appararls supplied by Parr Instrument Co. driven by 60 psi of nitrogen Then about 27 grams of styrene monomer, about L3 grams of benzoylperoxide in one cylinder and about 3.6 grams of butadiene monomer in another cylinder were introduced into the reactor by nitrogen initially under a pressure of about 75 psi and then increased 85 psi.After the reaction was allowed to continue for another 3.5 hours, the resulting suspension of copolymer particles was found to be stable and the copolymer particles had a number average molecular weight of 13,319, a weight molecular weight of 46,285, a molecular weight distribution of 3.48 and a yield of about 86 percent The foregoing reaction was repeated except that the additional styrene monomer, butadiene monomer and polymeriiation initiator were introduced 2.5 hours after the reaction mixture was heated to about 900C. After the reaction was allowed to continue for another 25 hours, the resulting suspension of copolymer particles was found w be stable and the copolymer had a number average molecular weight of 13,526, a weight average molecular weight of 90,904, a molecular weight distribution of 6.72, and a yield of about 93 percent The procedure was again repeated except that the additional charge was introduced 3.5 hours after the reaction mixture was heated to about 900C. After the reaction was allowed to continue for another 1.5 hours, the suspension was lost and the polymer beads agglomerated because less than about 70 percent by weight of the monomers in the additional charge was polymerized.The agglomerated copolymer had a number average molecular weight of 16,161, a weight average molecular weight of 46,034 and a molecular weight distribution of 2.84. The yields were not measured on agglomerated samples. The remaining 15 hours was insufficient to polymerize the monomers and this led to suspension failure and the end of the reaction This example illustrates that 13 and 35 hours of additional time result in a product having a narrow MWD but that 2.5 hours provide a desired MWD of.almost 7. It also demonstrates that the additional charge should be introduced early enough to acheive sufficient polymerization thereby avoiding loss of the suspension. EXAMPLE Tv The procedure of Example Ill is repeated with about 120 miilihters of de iomi7ed water, about 248 grams of calcium phosphate, and about 39 milligrams of an organosodium naphthalene sulfonate Alkanol XC . The reactor is flushed with nitrogen and heated to 900C.About 27 grams of styrene, about 3.6 grams of 1,3 butadiene and about 0.32 gram of benzoyl peroxide were introduced via the valved cylinder with the aid of nitrogen under a pressure of about 40 psi A slurry mixture of about 27 grams of styrene, about 179 grams of benzoyl peroxide and about L25 grams of tricalcium phosphate was prepared and introduced into the reactor by means of a valved cylinder along with 3.6 grams of 1,3 butadiene introduced via another valved cylinder at about 2.5 hours into the reaction of the original polymer mixture.The reactor itself was at 2 pressure of about 35 psi at 2.5 hours into the reaction The reaction was cooled after about S hours and the reaction product washed as described in Example LThe reaction produced a 93 percent yield of polymer having a Mw of about 127,000 and Mn of about 16,500, a MWD of about 7.7, and a residual styrene content of about 0.53 percent by weight based on the total weight of the polymer. EXAMPLE IV The procedure of Example IV was repeated except that tricalcium phosphate is introduced separately as a powder instead of as a slurry. The tricalcium phosphate is initially stored above the reactor in a small chamber separated from the reactor interior by means of a cap held by an O ring at the outer end. The pressure of the reactor interior maintains the cap in the chamber. The tricalcium phosphate is added at the same time as the monomeric reactant, 2.5 hours after the reaction was begun, by increasing the pressure in the chamber through a valve to a nitrogen source, thereby causing the cap to pop open and allow the tricalcium phosphate to be forced into the reactor.The reaction product obtained had properties substantially identical to the reaction pruduct obtained in Example IV. EXAMPLE VI A pressure reactor was charged with about 90 milliliters of deionized water. The reactor head was secured to the reactor. The reactor was heated with stirring to about 350C to 400C whereupon a slurry of about 2 23 grams of tncalcium phosphate and about 0.039 grams of Alkanol XC in about 30 milliliters of deionized water was added to the reactor.A condensor was attached to the reactor and a nitrogen purge begun while heating was continued to about 900C with stirring at about 500 spam. At about 9000 the reactor was charged with the aid of pressurized nitrogen with about L7 grams benzoyl peroxide and about 0.2 milliliterS of t butyl peroxybenzoate in about 54 grams styrene and about 73 grans of butadiene. The reactor was then closed and the temperature was maintained at about 9000 for about 240 minutes and thereafter raised to about 12500. The reaction was terminated after a total reaction time of 325 minutes. The resulting copolymer of. styrene and butadiene had a weight average molecular weight of about 88,000, and a molecular weight distibution of 4.34 and a residual styrene content of about 0.16 percent by weight based on the total weight of the polymer. The yield of copolymer was about 97 percent EXAMPLE VII The process of Example VI was repeated except varying amounts of benioyl peroxide were used.The results are set forth in the table below Benzoyl ResidualPeroxide Styrene Mw MWD udyO Yleld 2.1 68,000 4.08 0.13 99 2.5 52,000 395 0.12 99 3.4 41,000 3.67 0.08 99As indicated in the table, excellent yields were obtained with good molecular weight distribution and low residual styrene. EXAMPLE VIII The process. of Example VI was repeated except varying amounts ofL3 butadiene monomer were useb Also, the amount of tricalcium phosphate was increased to 3.00 grams for 13 percent butadiene and to 3.75 cams for 14 and 15 percent butadiene polymerization to preserve the suspension In other words the suspension will fail without this increase.The results are set forth in the table below ResidualButadiene Styrene hwm Mw MWD Tg wt Yield 10 73,000 3.64 65 99 13 101,000 5.02 56 016 99 14 124,000 5.78 53 026 99 15 151,000 7.04 47As indicated in the table, excellent yields were obtained with excellent molecular weight distribution EXAMPLE IX A reactor was prepared as described in Example VI up to the point of monomer addition whereupon about L3 grams of benzoyl peroxide and about 02 gram of 00 t butyl 0 2 ethylhexyl monoperoxycarbonate TBEC in about 54 grams of styrene and about 7.3 grams of 1,3 butadiene were added with the aid of nitrogen pressure.The reaction vessel was closed and maintained at about 900C for about 240 minutes to achieve about 92 percent dissociation of BPO and then raised to about 1200C for about 60 minutes to achieve about 51 percent dissociation of TBEC. This procedure was repeated twice with fresh reacants except that the last heating step was conducted at about 1200C for about 120 minutes to achieve about 71 percent dissociation of TBEC for the second mixture, and 180 minutes to achieve about 85 percent dissociation of TBEC for the third mixture.The results of these three runs were as follows Time commat Residual 1200C Styrene min.

EXAMPLE X reactor was prepared as described in Example VI up to the point of monomer addition, whereupon varying amounts of benzoyl peroxide and about 02 gram of 00 t butyl 0 2 ethylhexyl monoperoxycarbonate T3EC in about 54 grams of styrene and about 7.3 prams of 1,3 butadiene were added with the aid of nitrogen pressure. The reaction vessel was closed and maintained at about 900C for about 180 minutes to achieve about 82 percent dissociation of BPO and then raised to about 1200C for about 120 minutes. This reaction was terminated after the expiration of a total time of 325 minutes.The results of these reactions with varying amounts of initiator were as follows Benzoyl ResidualPeroxide Serene hwm Mw MWD yield 2.12 179,000 7.13 0.65 99 2.44 148,000 6.40 0S4 99 2.77 117,000 5.69 027 98 3.10 90,000 4.95 0.18 98As indicated in the table, excellent yields were obtained with excellent molecular weight distribution.
