## Description
TRAINING AID FOR SKIERS. In the skiing technique referred to as parallel skiing, the knees, ankles, feet and the skis are essentially in touch and parallel with each other while maneuvers are being executed. This technique allows one to steer with the ankles and knees and helps to maintain the skier s weight generally over the center of the skis.Accordingly, it is desirable for one who is learning to become a skier to master the technique of keeping his or her knees close together. Ski instructors have often had the learner hold his knees together by concentrating on holding a glove or the like between the knees. Prior art devices, such as those shown in the U.S. patents toMathauser, No. 3,644,919 Borraccio, No. 3,774,572 andCaris, No. 3,973,333, have been proposed for aiding a beginner in acquiring good skiing posture. Borraccio andCaris are particularly concerned with maintaining the knees in proper relative position, Borraccio disclosing an accordian type contact member carried on a strap positioned on one of the skier s legs just above the knee and extending inwardly toward the other leg. By means of this device, the skier knows whether or not his knees are close together.Caris discloses molded silicone rubber straps that are adapted to be positioned on a skier s legs, one strap having an inwardly opening socket and the other strap having a ball that is arranged to normally be seating in the socket. When the skier s knees move apart a predetermined distance, the ball leaves the socket with a popping noise to indicatethat the knees have separated. The present invention provides a training aid that is an improvement over prior art devices in that it provides a snap fastener which releasably retains a pair of straps together and in the provision of elastic strap material which gently urges the legs together as they tend to separate due to changes in terrain, without causing the elements of the snap fastener to become disconnected from each other.Also the elastic straps permit a considerable amount of relative up and down generally vertical movement of the knees. A training device includes two elastic straps1 one of which is adapted to be positioned around each leg of a skier and releasably connected to the other strap to aid the skier in maintaining proper positioning of his legs. Reference is now made to the accompanying drawings wherein Figure 1 is a diagrammatic perspective of a skier using the training device of the present invention. Figure 2 is an exploded diagrammatic perspective of the training device with the two elements of the device shown detached from each other. Figure 3 is a side elevation of one side of one of the two straps of the training device. Figure 4 is a side elevation of the other side of the strap of Figure 3. Figure 5 is a fragmentary plan of the device with the two straps attached, the view being taken looking in the direction of arrows 5 5 of Figure 1, with the skier s legs not indicated. Figure 6 is an enlarged central section taken generally along line 6 6 of Figure 5. DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT. The training device 10 of the present invention is shown in Figure 1 in operative position on a skier and, in general, it comprises two elastic straps 12 and 13.Each strap encircles one of the legs of the skier on the outside of the legs tof his pants and, at the point where the straps are directly opposite each other, they are held together by a releasable connector in the form of four snap members 15 Figure 2 which are arranged in two parallel rows of two snaps each. The straps 12 and 13 are substantially identical to each other and each strap comprises a band 20 Figure 3 of elastic material that is, for example, two inches wide and eighteen inches long. Each strap has a Velcro pad 22 sewn to its face near one end, and an identical Velcro pad 23 sewn to the opposite face at the other end.Intermediate its length, each strap has a reinforcing cloth panel 25 sewn to its face, and a part of each of the snap fasteners 15 is secured in conventional manner to each strap at these reinforced, intermediate portions of the straps. The snap fasteners 15 may be of the type marketed byRisdon of Spartanburg, South Carolina, under the markMighty Snaps. Each snap is a two piece member including a cap 30 that provides a socket and a locking member 31 that includes a projection or pin that is adapted to be held in the socket. In the present embodiment, the caps are disposed on strap 12 and the locking members are disposed on strap 13. In addition to opposed wall members that are pressed tightly against opposite sides of the associated strap, each cap 30 includes a disc shaped head 30a, a stem 30b projecting from the head, and a generally cylindrical flange 30c with an overhanging outer edge.A clip 30d, in the form of an interrupted circular loop of spring wire, is disposed in the annular Space defined by one of the wall members, the flange 30c and its overhanging outer edge. The locking member 31 includes circular flanges that bear tightly against opposite sides of the strap and a pin 31a that is arranged to be inserted into the retainer clip 30d and held therein by the inward pressure of the spring clip 30d. The pin 31a may taper outwardly slightly, Rs indicated in Figure 6, to assure a gripping engagement by the generally circular clip 30d. Referring to Figures 1 and 5, it will be seen that each of the straps 12 and 13 is secured on a skier s leg by wrapping it around the pants leg just above the knee, and then engaging the two Velcro pads 22 and 23 at the outside of the leg so that the caps 30 on strap 12 will be on the inner side of the leg directly opposite the pins 31a on strap 13. When the two straps are in place, the pins 31a of the locking members 31 are engaged in the sockets of the caps 30 so that the two straps are releasably held together as indicated in Figures 5 and 6. During a run over typical terrain, the legs tend to act like pistons and they can separate to some degree as they bounce up and down. The elastic straps gently pull the legs together as they tend to separate, and they do this without causing the snap fasteners to become disconnected. The elasticity of the straps is coordinated with the release action of the snaps so that the knees can move apart a distance of from 6 to 8 inches before the snaps will release. On the other hand, should an excess force be exerted on the snap fastener, such as during a fall, the snap will become disconnected to prevent possible injury to the skier. It will also be noted that the elasticity of the straps permits the cap and the locking pins of the snaps to be easily moved into engagement even when the skier is wearing gloves. The straps are wide enough so that they give broad, uniform comfortable distribution of pressure all around the area of the leg to which it is attached and they do not cut or groove into the leg.
