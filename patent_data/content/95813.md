## Abstract
A group of hydrophilic substituted purine antivirals, es pecially 9 2 hydroxyethoxymethyl guanine, can be effec tively delivered across skin by incorporating the selected antiviral into a binary, penetration enhancing vehicle con taining 1 a C₃ C₄ diol, diol ester or diol ether, and 2 a cell envelope disordering compound. These compositions provide surprising enhancement of delivery for the antivi rals when compared to existing vehicles or systems, and provide a method of treating viral infections. They are espe cially effective as antiherpetics.
