# HIGH PRODUCTION METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR FORMING FILLED EDIBLE PRODUCTS

## Abstract
Dough pieces for a baked product having an inner portion enveloped by a dissimilar outer portion are formed at a high production rate by continuously extruding two dissimilar materials to provide an extrudate rope composed of an inner core and an outer tube of different materials, depositing the extrudate rope on a continuously moving conveyor, cutting a double length section from the end of the rope with a blunt blade at one point along the conveyor, and on the same stroke dividing the double length section into individual dough pieces with a blunt blade.
