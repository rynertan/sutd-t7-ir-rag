# Double tube helical coil steam generator.

## Abstract
A double tube helical coil steam generator is provided in which a multiplicity of inner tubes conducting water are individ ually surrounded by outer tubes containing liquid metal as a heat transfer agent. The double tubes form into helical coils, providing a large surface area while conserving space. Immer sion of the double tube helical coil in hot liquid metal, e.g., from the core of a nuclear reactor, causes efficient transfer of heat across the liquid metal in the outer tube to the water in the in ner tube, creating superheated steam, which can be cycled to a turbine and converted to electrical power. The efficiency, reliability and safety of the multiple double tube design of the steam generator obviates the necessity of many secondary heat removal and emergency components in addition to conserving space and material.
