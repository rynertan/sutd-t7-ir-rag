# Stable immunochemical assay reagent for the determination of haptens, and assay method using said reagent.

## Abstract
Immunochemical assay reagents comprising combina tions of A a carboxyl containing water souble mono olefinic polymeric compound combined with a hapten or a chemically modified product thereof, or a hapten supported latex resulting from the chemical linking of the hapten bound polymeric compound to a polymeric latex, with B a hapten antibody, or a hapten antibody supported carrier and a method for immunochemically determining haptens using the assay reagent. The assay reagent is very stable and can be stored for an extended period of time without degradation. Transition from an agglutination inhibited pattern to an agglutinated pattern can be discerned clearly and rapidly with high sensitivity when using the assay reagent.
