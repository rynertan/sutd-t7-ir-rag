# Curable liquid compositions of epoxy and mercaptan terminated polymers.

## Abstract
Stable liquid adduct compositions are prepared by an addi tion reaction between epoxy terminated polymers and mer captan terminated polymers. One of the polymers is in stoichiometrix excess so that the composition has free epoxy or mercaptan functional groups. The liquid polymer composi tion can be stored for long periods before curing with a curing agent reactive with the free functional groups.
