# Die stamped circuit board assembly for photoflash devices and method of making.

## Abstract
A circuit board assembly 23 and method of making wherein the assembly 23 includes a dielectric substrate 47 , at least one radiation sensitive switch 45 , and at least one conductive member 61 in electrical contact with the switch 45 . Portions of the switch 45 and the conductive member 61 are die stamped into the dielectric substrate 47 to achieve the contact without severing the switch material.
