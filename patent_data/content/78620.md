## Description
PROTECTIVE CIRCUIT FOR CONTROL UNIT POWER SUPPLY The present invention relates to a protective circuit, and more particularly to a protective circuit for use with a power supply system having a single power supply for applying a voltage to a control unit and a device separate from the control unit. Numerical control systems in use today generally comprise a machine tool, a numerical control unit hereinafter referred to as an NC unit for controlling the machine tool to cut or otherwise machine or perform various other operations on a workpiece, and a control board or panel on which a variety of control buttons and switches are mounted for operating the machine tool. A power supply for such a numerical control system installed in a factory is housed in a locker or compartment in the NC unit to supply a voltage to the NC unit other itself and the control board or external device such as an electric circuit on the machine tool. The power supply is connected to the external device by power supply lines to which there are also connected loads such as semiconductor devices in the NC unit.When another power supply line of AC 100 or 200 volts in the factory is accidentally brought into contact with the power supply line or lines coupled to the NC unit power supply, the high AC voltage is applied to the NC unit to thereby cause semiconductor memory or other semiconductor devices therein to malfunction or be destroyed. The NC unit istalso liable to malfunction when the power supply lines for imposing a voltage to the external device are short circuited. Conventional power supply systemS for numerical control units however have included no circuit protecting the NC unit against accidental fault contact with other higher voltage power supply lines or short circuiting between the NC unit power supply lines. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a protective circuit for use with a single power supply for supplying a voltage to a control unit and to an external device which is separate from the control unit, the connection to the external device being through a pair of power supply lines, said protective circuit comprising an overvoltage detector circuit for detecting an overvoltage imposed between the power supply lines due to fault contact with another power supply line of a different voltage switching means energizable in response to detection of said overvoltage by said overvoltage detector circuit for short circuiting the power supply lines and a circuit breaker for being connected between the external device and said switching means, said circuit breaker being openable in response to energization of said switching means when said overvoltage detector circuit detects the overvoltage produced upon fault contact of the power supply lines with said another power supply line, whereby said power supply can be severed from said another power supply line and the external device in response to the opening of said circuit breaker to thereby protect the control unit against malfunctioning or destruction which would otherwise be caused by said overvoltage. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a protective circuit for use with a single power supply for supplying a voltage to a control unit and to an external device which is separate from the control unit, the connection to the external device being through a pair of power supply lines, said protective circuit comprising a current detector circuit for detecting a current flowing through one of the power supply lines a comparator for comparing the current as detected by said current detector circuit with a reference current and for producing a signal indicative of detect ion of an overcurrent when said current is larger than said reference current and switching means for severing the power supply from the external device in response to said signal from said comparator, whereby said power supply can be severed from the external deviCe in response to the actuation of said switching means when said overcurrent flows due to short circuiting between the power supply lines to thereby protect the control unit against malfunctioning or destruction which would otherwise be caused by said overcurrent. An embodiment of the present invention may provide a protective circuit for protecting semi can ductor devices in an NC unit against malfunctions or destruction when power supply lines connected to an external device associated with the NC unit are accidentally brought into fault contact with a highervoltage power supply line or are short circuited. An embodiment of the present invention may provide a protective circuit capable of quickly severing an external device from a power supply therefor when power supply lines for imposing a voltage from the power supply to the external device are brought into contact with a higher voltage power supply line. The above and other objects, features and advantages of an embodiment of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing in which a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown by way of illustrative example. The sole figure is a block diagram of a protective circuit according to the present invention, as incorporated in a power supply system for a control unit and an external device separate therefrom. The single figure shows a power supply system for a numerical control system including a power supply ll, an NC unit 12, an electric circuit 13 such as a control panel mounted on a machine tool not shown , and a protective circuit 14 for protecting the NC unit 12 against fault contact and short circuiting. The power supply 11 supplies a voltage of 24 volts, for example, to the NC unit 12 over a pair of power supply linesPSL1, PSL2 and also to the electric circuit 13 through the protective circuit 14 rover a pair of power supply lines PSL1 , PSL2 . The NC unit 12 and the electric circuit 13 are interconnected by a plurality of signal lines 11 through tln. The electric circuit 13 has a number of circuit units composed, for example, of a switch device 13a such as a limit switch or relay contacts, a relay 13b, a driver 13c for supplying the NC unit 12 with a signal indicative of turn on or turn off of the switch device 13a, and a receiver 13d for actuating the relay 13b in response to a signal issued from the NC unit 12. The protective circuit 14 is composed of a fault contact detector 141 and a short circuit detector 142. The fault contact detector 141 comprises an overvoltage detector circuit 141a for detecting an overvoltage applied between the power supply lines PSL1 , PSL2 , a switch device 141b such as a power transistor or thyristor for short circuiting the power supply lines PSL1 , PSL2 in response to an overvoltage as detected by the overvoltage detector circuit 141a, and a circuit breaker 141c such as a fuse inserted in the power supply line PSL1 between the electric circuit 13 and the switch device 141b for cutting off the power supply line PSL1 . The overvoltage detector circuit 141a includes a voltage divider DIV of series connected resistors for dividing the voltage between the power supply lines PSL1 , PSL2 , and a comparator COM for comparing a fraction voltage at the resistor junction with a reference voltage Er.The short circuit detector 142 has a current detector circuit 142a for detecting a current flowing through the power supply line PSL1 , a comparator 142b for comparing a current Ia as detected by the current detector circuit 142a with a reference current Ir and for producing as an output an overcurrent signal OCS when the current Ia is larger than the reference current Ir, and a control device 142c such as a transistor which can be turned off by the overcurrent signalOCS as delivered from the comparator 142b. Operation of the power supply system of the above construction will be described. When a higher voltage power supply line not shown as ofAC 100 volts is brought into fault contact with the power supply line PSLll at a point P, the overvoltage applied is detected by the overvoltage detector circuit 141a and the switch device 141b is turned on, whereupon the power supply lines PSL1 , PSL2 are short circuited. At this time, a large short circuit current flows through the fuse 141c, which then melts away instantaneously. As a result, the power supply 11 is severed higher voltage paver supply line and the from thetelectric circuit 13 and hence no AC 100 volts are imposed on the NC unit 12. The semiconductor components in theNC unit 12 are therefore protected against malfunctioning or destruction. When the power supply lines PSLl1, POST21 are accidentally short circuited for some reason, a large short circuit currentIa flows through the current detector circuit 142a. Since the short circuit current Ia is larger than the reference currentIr, the comparator 142b produces an overcurrent signal OCS which de energizes the transistor 142c, at which time the power supply short circuit and the11 is separated from the electric circuit 13. As a consequence, the NC unit 12 is protected against malfunctions or destruction which would otherwise be caused by the short circuit current Ia. While in the illustrated embodiment the protective circuit 14 is composed of both the fault contact detector 141 and the short circuit detector 142, the protective circuit 14 may of comprise either the fault contact detector 141 or the short circuit detector 142 alone. With the arrangement of the present embodiment therefore, the protective circuit interposed between the power supply and the external electric circuit can immediately sever the power supply from the external electric circuit when the power supply lines connected to the external electric circuit are short circuited or brought into fault contact with a higher voltage power supply line, thus protecting semiconductor devices in the NC unit against malfunctioning or destruction. Although a certain preferred embodiment has been shown and described in detail, it should be understood that many changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the appended claims.
