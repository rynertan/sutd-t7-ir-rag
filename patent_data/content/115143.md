# INTEGRATED CIRCUIT WITH ELECTROSTATIC BREAKDOWN PREVENTION CIRCUITS

## Abstract
An integrated circuit having a high resistance to electro static breakdown before mounting and a high operation speed after mounting. At least one series connected fuse element F1 and electrostatic breakdown prevention device D1 is provided between an external terminal P and a power source line Vcc and or ground line VEE in the integrated circuit. After the integrated circuit is mounted to a printed circuit board, a voltage is applied to melt the fuse element, separating the electrostatic breakdown prevention device from the integrated circuit.
