# Aluminium articles having anodic oxide coatings and methods of colouring them by means of optical interference effects.

## Abstract
The invention provides aluminium articles having porous anodic oxide films coloured by means of an optical interference effect. In Figure 4, the article 10 carries a first anodic oxide film 12 with pores 14 enlarged at their inner ends 20 and containing deposits 22. The products may be made by growing a second anodic oxide film 26 underneath the deposits 22 which are preferably of acid resistant material. X is at least 26 nm, Y is preferably at least 60 nm, Z is preferably 15 nm to 200 nm, Y Z is preferably 75 nm to 600 nm, and W is preferably at least 15 nm.
