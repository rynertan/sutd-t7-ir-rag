# Method and apparatus for the treatment of wastewater.

## Abstract
A method for treating wastewater by circulating waste water around a system comprising a downcomer 1 and a riser 2 which communicate directly at their lower ends, the level of the wastewater in the downcomer 1 being main tained above the level of the wastewater in the riser 2 to provide a hydrostatic pressure head which causes circulation of the wastewater around the system, supplying a gas con taining oxygen to the wastewater as it passes through the downcomer 1 , pumping at 9 the wastewater from the top of the riser 2 back into the top of the downcomer 1 and remov ing treated wastewater from the riser 2 at the same rate as wastewater is introduced at 4 into the system the height of the hydrostatic pressure head is controlled by adjusting the height at which treated wastewater is removed from the riser 2 and the lever of the wastewater in the riser 2 . It is also provided an apparatus for putting the method into practice.
