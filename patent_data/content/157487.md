## Description
CERAMIC COMPACTS COMPRISING ZIRCONIA This invention relates to a ceramic compact or sintered body and more particularly, it is concerned with a ceramic compact predominantly comprising tetragonal and or cubic zirconia ZrO2 . Sintered ceramic materials have been studied and developed for use as structural materials. However, their practical use has been quite limited owing to practical difficulties in obtaining adequate strength, stability and durability. Compacts comprising tetragonal ZrO2, both dispersed and partly stabilized and having a transverse rupture strength of 110 kg mm2 are known fromJP A 140762 1980. Compacts consisting of ZrO2 and one or more boride, carbide or nitride of AL, Si, or elements in Groups IVa, Va, and VIa of thePeriodic Table and or Al 203 are known from JP A120571 1983. The latter compacts have a transverse rupture strength up to 160 kg mm2, but cannot be conveniently sintered. It is a general object of the present invention to provide a novel ceramic compact. It is another object of the present invention to provide a high strength ceramic compact predominantly comprising tetragonal and or cubic ZrO2 and in particular a compact which is readily sintered. A ceramic compact according to the invention comprises ZrO 2 as a predominant component. A stabilizer, preferably selected from oxides of Grout lIla elements, CaO or MgO or a mixture of such oxides is dissolved in the zirconia to form a solid solutioi The compact includes a second component consisting of at least one carbonitride, carboxide, oxynitridt or carboxynitride of an element in Group IVa, Va, oz VIa of the Periodic Table. In particular, a ceramic compact according te the invention comprises 55 to 96 by volume of first component, 4 to 45 by volume of a seconc component and at most 3 by volume of unavoidable impurities. The first component is ZrO2 consistinc of 80 by weight or more of tetragonal and or cubic form, structure the balance being monoclinic one oz more oxides selected from the group consisting of oxides of Group IIIa elements of the Periodic Table,CaO and SgO, and mixtures thereof are dissolved tc forn a solid solution. The second component comprises at least one carbonitride, carboxide, oxynitride or carboxynitride or an element in GroupIVa, Va or VIa of Periodic Table, or a mixture or a solid solution thereof. If the ZrO2 phase is less than 55 by volume of the sintered compact, the strength of the compact is insufficient, while if the ZrO2 phase is more than 96 by volume, the hardness and strength of the corn pact are lowered. Furthermore, the ZrO2 phase preferably consists of 80 by weight or more of tetragonal and or cubic form, since if the proportion of the monoclinic form is increased, the strength of the compact is lowered. Impurities incorporated in the raw materials or introduced during the manufacturing process should be at most 3 by volume to avoid loss of strength in the compact. The aforementioned stabilizer is required to keep the zirconia phase tetragonal or cubic, and should be present to a predetermined amount, herein intended to mean 1 3 to 1 1 of the amount capable of keeping stable the cubic form up to the minimum temperature shown in the constitutional diagram.When the stabilizer is Y203 the predetermined amount is 2.5 to 7.5 mol . In the second component, the use of Ti compounds for some purposes, particularly for a substrate for a thin film magnetic head, is preferably avoided, since the Ti compounds have a hardness which is considerably different from that of the ZrO2 phase, and so the surface tends to be roughened during surface grinding. Moreover, if a carbide or nitride alone is used for the second component, sintering is difficult, and even mixtures of carbide and nitride do not improve sintering. However, the use of substitution solid solutions such as carbonitrides, carboxides, oxynitrides and carboxynitrides generally yields high strength compacts.In particular, it is preferable to use a solid solution represented by the general formula, M C1NmOn n z wherein M represents at least one Group IVa, GroupVa or Group VIa element of Periodic Table, 1 m n 1, 1 m num 0, m n num 0, 1 n num 0 and 1.2 z 0.5. Preparation of the compact or sintered body of the present invention can be carried out in known manner. For example, a mixture of starting powders may be subjected to a hot press or to compacting followed by sintering at atmospheric pressure.Furthermore, it is found that a subsequent hot hydraulic press is very effective for obtaining a precise compact. The following examples are given in order tc illustrate the present invention in detail without limiting the same. EXAMPLE 1 A respective sample of ZrO 2, prepared by a coprecipitation method and containing 3 mols of Y2 , was mixed with each of the second components listed in Table 1 and then hot pressed in vacuo at 1500 OC and 300 kg cm2 for 2 hours. The volumetric measures were made on the assumption of a relative density of 6.05 for ZrO2 and a known density for the second component for the calculation of a corresponding weight ratio.The various compacts were subjected to grinding and then to X ray diffraction to obtain the proportions of the tetragonal form and cubic form according to the following formula Volume Ratio of tetragonal cubic tetragonal 111 cubic 111 monoclinic 111 miioclnic ll1 tetral ll1 cttic li The hardness and transverse rupture strength were measured by the methods according to HRA and JIS. It will clearly be understood from the results as shown in Table 1 that a markedly high strength can be given when the second component is in a proportion of 4 to 45 by volume and consists of carbonitrides, carboxides, oxynitrides or carboxynitrides or Group IVa, Va and VIa elements or a solid solution thereof.

The results are shown in Table 2.Depending upon the particular stabilizer, it may bf required that at least 80 by weight of the ZrO crystals are of tetragonal and cubic form.

This is considered due to the fact that the Ti compounds have a greater hardness that is largely different from that of the Zrz phase. Owing to the excellent surfaces that can readily be obtained, the present invention is useful in the manufacture of thin film magnetic heads. When the compact of Sample No. 4 in Table 1 was worked into a substrate for a thin film magnetic head, the compact could be well machined and a substrate made from such a compact compared favourably in performance with the commonly used Al2 03 TiC ceramics. EXAMPLE 4 The mixed powders with the compositions of Table 1 were prepared in a manner as described in Example 1, subjected to a hydrostatic pressure press at a pressure of 2 t cm2 and sintered in vacuum at 1600 OC. Further, the resulting compacts were subjected to a hot hydrostatic press at 1600 OC and 1000 atm in Ar gas.The properties of the compacts are shown in Table 3 Table 3Second Component Transverse sample Composition Amount Tetragonal Cubic Hardness Density RuptureNo. vol vol HRA g cm Strength MPa 41 Ti0.7N0.3 15 85 99.5 92.0 160 42 TiC0.7N0.3 35 85 99.0 93.0 160 43 TiC0.5O0.5 25 90 99.5 92.5 160 44 ZrC0.5N0.5 25 90 99.5 92.0 160 46 Ti0.5W0.5C0.9N0.1 25 90 99.5 92.5 160 47 TiN0.5O0.5 25 90 99.5 92.5 160 48 TiC0.5N0.3O0.2 25 90 99.5 92.5 160 49 TiC0.7N0.3 50 70 98 91.0 70 50 TiC0.7N0.3 2 90 99.5 91.0 100 51 TiC 25 85 98 90.5 80 52 TiN 25 80 98 90.5 80TiC 12.5 53 85 99 90.5 100TiN 12.5 54 90 99.5 91.0 100 EXAMPLE 5 A slitter for a magnetic tape, having a dimension of 120 mm x 50 mm x 2 mm holed disk was made in an analogous manner to Example 1, Sample No. 1 ofTable 1 and subjected to assessment of the edge breakage after grinding and the cutting performance.The slitter of the present invention exhibited a better cutting performance or sharpness without breakage, than that of the commonly used fine grain cemented carbides. In addition, the wear resistance of the slitter of the present invention was at least twice that of the cemented carbides. On the other hand, a comparative slitter made of tetragonal ZrO2 only was inferior in cutting performance owing to edge breakage, to that of cemented carbides. As is evident from these results, the compositions of the present invention are excellent for sintering.The invention is useful for the mass production of compacts having complicated shapes generally, and the ceramic compacts with a high transverse rupture strength may be made by an inexpensive sintering method.
