# VACUUM DEPOSITION PROCESSES EMPLOYING A CONTINUOUS PNICTIDE DELIVERY SYSTEM, PARTICULARLY SPUTTERING

## Abstract
A pnictide film deposition apparatus characterised in that it comprises A a reservoir for containing heated pnictide B means for passing an inert gas therethrough C a vacuum film deposition chamber and D means for supplying the said inert gas carrying the said pnictide as a vapour species after passing through the said pnictide to the said deposition chamber is disclosed. A process for the vacuum deposition of pnictide film characterised in that it comprises passing an inert gas through heated pnictide and supplying the product gas to a vacuum chamber is also disclosed. Films of pnictide, polypnictide and other pnictide com pounds may be deposited for semiconductor, thin film transistors and other applications including insulation and passivation, particularly on III V semiconductors. The local order of the deposited films may be controlled by varying the amount of energy delivered to the surface of the substrate, which is a function of its temperature, the RF power used and the amount of excess Pnictideâ‚„ supplied. Referring to the accompanying illustrative drawing, the present apparatus may comprise reservoir 70, inert gas supply 48, chamber 44 and means for pnictide vapour supply to chamber 76. The present invention represents an advance over the prior art.
