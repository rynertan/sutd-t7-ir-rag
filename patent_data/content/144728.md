# Shielded ribbon cable and method.

## Abstract
A shielded ribbon cable is formed either by trimming a conventional ribbon cable to expose one or both edge conductors, and coating the cable by painting it with a conductive paint or covering it with an extruded conductive plastic layer, or by forming a ribbon cable of individually coated wires, one or both edge conductors having a conductive coating, and subsequently painting it with a conductive paint or covering it with an extruded conductive plastic layer. One or both edge conductors thus serve as drain wires for the shield formed by the external covering of conductive paint or conductive extruded plastic.
