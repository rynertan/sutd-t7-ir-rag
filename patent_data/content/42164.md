# A process for separating p xylene from other alkyl substituted monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
An absorptive separation process is disclosed for separating para aromatic isomers from a hydrocarbon feed containing a mixture of aromatic isomers, using a crystalline aluminosilicate adsorbent which has been treated with an alkyl amine preferably an alkyl amine hydrochloride. The alkyl amine treatement substantially increases the selectivity of the adsorbent for the para xylene isomer, relative to the heavy desorbent p DEB thereby improved the efficiency of the separation pro cess.
