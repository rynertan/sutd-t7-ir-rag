# Twin tension torsion beam rotor system.

## Abstract
A rotor system for a helicopter including a tension torsion component 20 which is fabricated from composite material and as a compound curved, continuous loop twin tension tor sion beam. Each end of the twin tension torsion beam 20 in cludes two curved wrapped ends which are oriented sub stantially orthogonally. At one end the curved ends 20a, 20b extend about the flap hinge 18 , and at the other end the curved ends 20c, 20d extend about the fold and lead lag hinge of the rotor system. To accommodate the twin tension torsion beam at the flap hinge a support fitting 42 is provided with lugs 44, 46 which are made compatible with the rotor hub lugs 28, 30, 32 , and to accommodate the twin tension tor sion beam 20 at the fold and lead lag hinge a pitch varying structure 76 is provided with twin beam engaging clevis sur faces 106 .
