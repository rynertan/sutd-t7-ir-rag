# Method of preparing 2,2 dithiodianiline.

## Abstract
Method of preparing 2,2 dithiodianiline by the steps of A obtaining an agitated mixture of a water solution of a salt of o aminothiophenol and an unstable dispersion there in of a liquid hydrocarbon, B oxidizing said salt by the slow addition of a water soluble peroxide, C discontinuing the agitation to allow the formation of a sharply defined lower aqueous phase and upper hydrocarbon phase, D drawing off said lower aqueous phase and E distilling the hydrocarbon phase therefrom and recovering said 2,2 dithiodianiline as a distilland.
