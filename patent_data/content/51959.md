# Voltage regulator for photovoltaic charging systems.

## Abstract
A voltage regulator for controlling the photovoltaic charg ing of storage batteries 12 is arranged to selectively include or shed one or more portions of a photovoltaic array 10 to provide appropriate charging voltage in the storage batteries 12 . The photovoltaic array 10 is electrically divided into n strings. The terminal voltage of batteries 12 is monitored 16 relatively to a predetermined reference level 17 . When the monitored terminal voltage exceeds the reference level, then a logic means 18 adds to remove the appropriate number of strings from the charging circuit. Conversely those strings are re introduced as appropriate if the battery terminal voltage falls below the reference level.
