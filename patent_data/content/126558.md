## Description
TITLE BISBIGUANIDE DERIVATIVES This invention relates to novel bisbiguanide derivatives which possess antibacterial properties. In United Kingdom patent specification No.705,838 there are disclosed and claimed bisbiguanides of the general formula A H.C NH NH.C NH NH CH NH.C NH NH.C NH NH A 2n wherein A stands for a phenyl radical which is substituted by alkyl, alkoxy, nitro or halogen, and wherein the two A s may be the same or different, and wherein n is an integer from 3 to 9 inclusive, and wherein the polymethylene chain may be interrupted by oxygen atoms and or by aromatic nuclei.The compounds are said to be useful as bactericides for example, those of the formula A NH.C NH NH.C NH NH CH NH.C NH NH.C NH NH A 2 5 7 II wherein A stands for a halogen substituted phenyl radical possess very high antibacterial activity when tested in vitro against the organisms Streptococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus coli, Clostridium welchii and Pseudomonas pyocyanea. A paper by Rose and Swain, J. Chem. Soc., 1956, 4422 4425, is concerned with bisbiguanides of the above, and other, types. The authors indicated that compounds containing only one biguanide unit were but weakly antibacterial, but that full biological activity was achieved with compounds containing two biguanide units. They stated that effort was then concentrated on ascertaining the optimum distance which should exist between the two biguanide units, and the most effective types of end groups whether, for example, antibacterial activity was highest in bisbiguanides in which the terminal groups were aryl, alkyl or heterocyclic. They further stated that the highest antibacterial activity had been found with diaryl compounds of the formula EMI2.1 and in particular when n stood for 5, 6 or 7.They also stated that analogous alkyl bisbiguanides of the formula RR N.C NH NR.C NH NH CH NH.C NH NH.C NH NRR 26 IV wherein R stands for an alkyl radical and R stands for hydrogen or an alkyl radical, were only fractionally as effective one third to one tenth as the compounds of the formula III. Specific alkyl bisbiguanides of the formula IV which are described in the paper are those wherein both R s stand for hydrogen, and a related compound in which both R s stand for a cyclohexyl radical. An essentially similar teaching is to be found in a paper by Davies et al., Brit.J.Pharmacol., 1954, 9, 192 196. In United Kingdom patent specificationNo.1,095,902 there is disclosed and claimed a broad group of bisguanides and bisbiguanides which includes inter alia compounds of the formula 2 RR N C C NH NH I A CNH.C NH I NRR V x x 2 wherein A stands for an alkylene radical of 2 to 12 carbon atoms having the valency bonds attached to different carbon atoms, or for a group of the formula EMI3.1 R stands for an alkyl radical of 6 to 16 carbon atoms,R stands for hydrogen, and x stands for 1 or 2. The bisguanides and bisbiguanides are said to have particular usefulness as plant fungicides and bactericides. On page 6 of the said specification No.1,095,902 data are presented which illustrate the high degree of bacteriostatic, bactericidal, fungistatic and fungicidal activity possessed by the higher alkyl compounds , for example the n hexyl and n heptyl compounds, containing a hexamethylene bridge, in comparison with the activities of the corresponding lower alkyl compounds , represented by the n butyl compound. These data indicate that the said n hexyl compound is 10 times more active as a bacteriostatic agent, and 25 times more active as a bactericidal agent, than said n butyl compound against S. aureus. A paper by Cutler et al., Soap and ChemicalSpecialties, 1966 2 , 45 49 and 101 103, is concerned with compounds of the formula V and other bisbiguanides. On pages 48 and 49 of that paper it is stated that, although previous workers Davies et al., ibid. noted the need for the terminal aromatic nucleus in bisbiguanides of the type in question,Cutler et al. s hypothesis, which is discussed in their paper, predicted that a bisbiguanide in which the aryl radical was replaced by an alkyl radical of the proper chain length also should have high antimicrobial activity.It is stated that this has actually been found to be the case in preliminary tests the following three compounds stood out as highly active antibacterial agents R NR.C NR NH.C NH NH CH NH.C NH NR.Cf NH NBR 26 VII wherein R stands for a hexyl presumably n hexyl , heptyl presumably n heptyl or 2 ethylhexyl radical.It is further stated that the n butyl homologue of these compounds, which was described by Rose and Swain, ibid., was considerably less active, being especially so in the case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, against which it was only 1 25th as active as the most potent member of the series. The present invention is based upon the discovery that certain novel bisbiguanides in which the end groups are lower alkyl or related radicals, surprisingly have very good antibacterial properties.This is particularly unexpected in view of the prior art, discussed above, which teaches quite clearly that known bisbiguanides with lower alkyl end groups are very much less effective as bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal compounds than the corresponding hexyl, heptyl and 2ethylhexyl derivatives. In the compounds of the present invention, we have found, surprisingly, that this is not, in fact, the case. Thus according to the present invention there are provided bisbiguanides of the formula 12 5 6 34R R N.C NR SH.C SH NE X SH.C NH NH.C NE NR R VIII 1 2 or a tautomeric form thereof, wherein each of R , R 3 4R , and R , which may be the same or different, is hydrogen, an alkyl radical of up to 5 carbon atoms 1 5C 1234 such that R , R , R and R together contain 4 to 12 carbon atoms, or a 3 5C alkenyl radical or R 2R and the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, or 3 4R and R and the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, which may be the same or different, are each a l azetidinyl, l pyrrolidinyl, piperidino, hexamethyleneimino, heptamethyleneimino, morpholino or 4 1 8C alkanoyl l piperazinyl radical, each of which may bear 1 3C alkyl substituents provided that at least one of 1 2 3 4 5R , R , R , and R is other than hydrogen R 6 and R , which may be the same or different, are each hydrogen or a 1 8C alkyl radical and X is a 7 20C linking group which is a straight chain alkylene radical, or a straight chain alkylene radical bearing one or more 1 3C alkyl substituents, of which any pair or pairs which are attached to different carbon atoms may be joined so as to form, together with the intervening carbon atom or atoms of the alkylene radical, a cycloalkyl radical or radicals and the acid addition salts thereof. Each of RÚ , Rê , R and R4 may be, for example, a methyl, ethyl, n propyl1 isopropyl, n butyl, sec butyl, isobutyl, n pentyl, neopentyl or allyl radical, and such radicals of 3 or 4 carbon atoms are preferred. 1 2 3 4 When R and R , and R and R , together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a heterocyclic radical, preferred such radicals are the 1pyrrolidinyl and piperidino radicals, and a preferred alkyl substituted such radical is, for example, the 2,6 dimethylmorpholino radical. 5 6 Each of R and R may be, for example, a methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, sec butyl, isobutyl, n pentyl, neo pentyl, n hexyl, n heptyl, noctyl or 2 ethylhexyl radical. The linking group X may be, for example, a heptamethylene, octamethylene, nonamethylene, decamethylene, undecamethylene, dodecamethylene or hexadecamethylene radical. Suitable alkyl substituents on a straight chain alkylene radical X, are, for example, methyl, ethyl and n propyl radicals, and a suitable value for X in which two pairs of such alkyl radicals are joined together is, for example, the methylene bis 4 cyclohexyl diradical. Preferred values for X are the undecamethylene, dodecamethylene and methylenebis 4 cyclohexyl radicals. A preferred group of compounds of the invention comprises those wherein the groups R Rê , R , R4 and X together contain 16 to 28, 5 6 preferably 18 to 24, carbon atoms and R and R are hydrogen. Particularly preferred, because of their high antibacterial activity, are those compounds 1234 wherein R , R , R and R are all alkyl radicals. Particular preferred compounds of the invention are 1,12 dodecanebis 5 n butylbiguanide , 1,12 dodecanebis 5 isobutylbiguanide , 1,12 dodecanebis 5 n pentylbiguanide and 1,12 dodecanebis 5neopentylbiguanide , and their dihydrochlorides. The acid addition salts of the invention may be derived from an inorganic or organic acid. In most circumstances it is preferable that the salts be derived from an acid which affords an anion which is suitable for human usage, for example a pharmaceutically acceptable anion. Examples of such acids are hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulphuric, D gluconic, 2 pyrrolidone 5 carboxylic, methanesulphonic, carbonic, lactic, acetic and glutamic acids. A preferred group of bisbiguanide derivatives of the invention comprises compounds of the formula 1 3 2VIII wherein R and R are each 1 5C alkyl, RR41 R5 and R6 are each hydrogen, and X is undecamethylene or dodecamethylene, and within this group, the compounds 1 3 wherein R and R are each n butyl, sec butyl, isobutyl, n pentyl or neopentyl are especially preferred. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of the compounds of the invention wherein 5 6R and R are both hydrogen, which comprises reacting a bis cyanoguanidine of the formula NC.NH.C NH NEI X NR.e NH .NH.CN X 12 with an amine, R R NH, or with two different 12 34 amines, R R NH and R R NH, in the form of an 1 2 3 acid addition salt thereof, wherein X, R , R , R 4 and R have the meanings stated above, at a o o temperature of 100 to 170 C. A suitable amine salt is, for example, the hydrochloride. The reactants are heated together until the reaction is complete. The reaction proceeds fastest at the higher temperatures, but if thermal stability at higher temperatures appears to be a problem, the reaction can be carried out at lower temperature for a longer period. The reactants are most conveniently melted together in the absence of a solvent, but if desired an inert solvent such as 2methoxyethanol, 2 ethoxyethanol, nitrobenzene, sulpholane, isopropanol, n butanol, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether or water, or a mixture of such solvents may be used. The bis cyanoguanidine starting material of the formula X, used in the above process, may be obtained by reacting the appropriate diamine NH 2NH , in the form of an acid addition salt, 2 conveniently the dihydrochloride, with sodium dicyanamide, in conventional manner. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of the compounds of the invention which comprises reacting a diamine of the formulaH2N X NH2, in the form of an acid addition salt, with a cyanoguanidine of the formula 12 5 R R N.C NR NH.CN XI or with a cyanoguanidine of the formula XI and a cyanoguanidine of the formula 34 6 R R N.C NR NH.CN XII 1 2 3 4 5 6 and wherein X, R , R , R , R , R and R have the meanings stated above, at a temperature of o o 100 to 170 C. A suitable salt of the diamine is, for example, the dihydrochloride. The reactants are heated together until the reaction is complete. The reaction proceeds fastest at the higher temperatures, but if thermal stability is a problem, the reaction temperature should be lowered, and the reaction allowed to proceed for longer. If a melt can be formed at those temperatures the reactants are conveniently melted together in the absence of a solvent. If not, or alternatively, the reactants are heated together in a suitable inert solvent, for example those mentioned above. The cyanoguanidine starting materials of the formula XI and XII, wherein R and R are hydrogen, used in the above process, may be obtained in 12 conventional manner by reacting an amine R R NH or 34R R NH, in the form of an acid addition salt, conveniently the dihydrochloride, with sodium dicyanamide. The cyanoguanidines of the formulae XI and 5 6XII wherein R and R are other than hydrogen, which may be used as starting materials in the above process, may be obtained by reacting a dialkyl cyanoimido dithio carbonate, for example dimethyl cyanoimido dithio carbonate, MeS C N.CN, with 12 25 appropriate amines R R NH and R NH which are 34 2 6 preferably the same , or R R NH and R NH 2 The acid addition salts of the invention are obtained by conventional means. The antibacterial activity of the compounds of the invention has been measured by the well known minimum inhibitory concentration MIC test. Neat or diluted broth cultures of eight Gram positive organisms Streptococcus pyogenes, S. faecalis, 3 strains ofStaphyloccus aureusr Listeria monocytogenes,Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis , Candida albicans and fourteen Gram negative organisms 4 strains ofEscherichia coli, Salmonella dublin, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis and 3 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inoculated by means of an automatic microtitre inoculator on the surface of nutrient agar plates containing two fold or five fold dilutions of a test compound. After 0 incubation over night at 37 C., the MIC s of the test compound are read. The geometric mean MIC s for the eight Gram positive organisms plus Candida, and 14 Gram negative organisms are then calculated for each test compound. Depending upon its precise chemical structure, a compound of the Invention has a mean MIC within the range 1 12txg. ml. in agar against the 8Gram positive organisms and Candida, and 20 250 tLg. ml. in agar against the 14 Gram negative organisms. The preferred compounds of the invention have an acute LD50 within the accepted limits for compounds used topically, are of low irritancy in the Draize test on intact rabbit skin, are negative in the Ames test for mutagenicity, and are non sensitizing in the Magnusson andKligman contact sensitivity test in guinea pigs.Because of their antibacterial properties, the compounds of the invention are useful for many purposes, for example a in medical and veterinary practice for the disinfection of wounds, membranes and or skin tissue b for the sterilisation of surgical instruments and other medical apparatus and equipment, for example respirators, ventilators, incubators, humidifiers, etc. c for incorporation in toothpastes and mouthwashes for inhibiting the formation of dental plaque, and gingivitis d for the disinfection of hard surfaces, for example plant and equipment used in the food and drink industries, and floors and walls in the home, factories and hospitals e for the disinfection of textiles, for example blankets, overalls, bed linen etc. f for the control of microbiological slime in the pulp and paper industries g for the control of micro organisms in swimming pools, cooling water, pasteuriser water, aqueous oil emulsions such as metal working fluids, and other circulating water systems and h as plant bactericides and fungicides. Compounds of the invention also possess useful antifungal activity against, for example,Candida albicans and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and algicidal and anti yeast properties. According to a further feature of the invention there are provided antibacterial or antifungal compositions comprising a compound of the 12345 formula VIII wherein R , R , R , R , R , R and X have the meanings stated above, or an acidaddition salt thereof, and an inert diluent or carrier there for. The antibacterial or antifungal compositions of the invention are prepared by conventional means using conventional excipients. They include, for example, aqueous solutions, for example concentrated aqueous solutions, sterile, ready to use aqueous solutions, aqueous dispersions, and emulsions, for example oil in water emulsions, for example aqueous gels, creams, ointments and pastes. Suitable excipients include, for example, wetting agents, dispersing agents, emulsifying agents, gelling agents or thickening agents. According to a further feature of the invention, there is provided a contraceptive method which comprises applying to sperm, or the locus of sperm, a spermicidal, sperm immobilising or mucospissic amount of a compound of the invention of the formula VIII. In one aspect of this method1 the compound of the formula VII, when applied to vaginal mucus at a suitable concentration, very rapidly increases its viscosity, to the extent that it becomes essentially impenetrable to sperm, and forms a physical barrier to conception in the same way as a rubber sheath or a diaphragm cap. Besides increasing the viscosity of vaginal mucus, when the mucus comes into contact with a bisbiguanide compound of the formula VII, other changes occur in its intrinsic properties, such as its morphology, rheology and water uptake and visco elastic properties, which can also effect its penetrability to sperm. The compounds also possess spermicidal or sperm immobilising properties. In vitro, the compounds of the formula VII exert a useful contraceptive effect at concentrations down to about 10 3 to 10 4 , and a suitable amount to be applied to the human vagina for contraceptive purposes is from 1.0 g. to 10 4 The compound of the formula VIII may be applied to the vagina in conventional manner, for example as a pessary, cream, liquid douche, gel, aerosol foam or impregnated tampon, or in a controlled delivery device of the compound in a polymer matrix. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a compound of the formula VIII, or a composition thereof, for use as a contraceptive. The invention is illustrated but not limited by the following Examples in which the temperatures are expressed in degrees Celsius Example 1 A mixture of isopropylamine hydrochloride 2.9g. and 1,12 dodecanebis 3 cyanoguanidine 5.lg. 0 was stirred and heated at 140 150 in an oil bath for 3 hr.
