## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF PARA XYLENEFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for the production of para xylene, and more particularly, to a process for efficiently producing para xylene by methyl at ing benzene or toluene by the use of a specific catalyst.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Various methods have been proposed for the production of para xylene that is industrially very useful. It is known that para xylene is produced selectively when toluene is alkylated with methyl alcohol in the presence of a crystalline aluminosilicate catalyst containing fine pores having definite dimensions, such as ZSM 5Zeolite. It is also known that the selectivity of para xylene is increased when sodium or hydrogen ions in the crystalline aluminosilicate catalyst are replaced by other metals. For example, Japanese Patent Application LaidOpen No. 7598 1980 discloses a process for the production of para xylene from toluene and methyl alcohol and a process for the production of para xylene by isomerization of ortho or meta xylene or disproportionation of toluene, using a catalyst comprising a siliceous support and a metal, such as chromium, beryllium, and titanium. Conventional techniques, however, have disadvantages in that the selectivity of para xylene is still insufficiently satisfactory and the catalytic activity drops in a relatively short period of time. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the invention is to produce efficiently para xylene from benzene or toluene. Another object of the invention is to produce paraxylene in a very high selectivity. Still another object of the invention is to maintain the activity of catalyst at a high level for a long period of time. It has been found that the objects can be attained by using a catalyst composed mainly of A crystalline borosilicate and B a compound containing at least one element selected from the group consisting of Group IIa. elements of, the Periodic Table, Group IIIa elements of the Periodic Table, silicon, and phosphorus. The present invention relates to a process for producing para xylene by methylating benzene or toluene in the presence of a catalyst composed mainly of A crystalline borosilicate and B a compound containing at least one element selected from the group consisting ofGroup IIa elements of the Periodic Table, Group IIIa elements of the Periodic Table, silicon, and phosphorus.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING Figure 1 shows an X ray diffraction pattern of the crystalline borosilicate obtained in Referential Example as described hereinafter. In the figure, means theBragg angle degree . An asterisk shows a peak of silicon oxide as a standard substance. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The catalyst as used herein contains Components A and B as described above as major ingredients. As Component A , crystalline borosilicate, various compounds can be used, including the crystalline borosilicates as described in, for example, Japanese PatentApplication Laid Open Nows. 55500 1978, 7598 1980, 84313 1981, 123817 1982, and 129820 1982. These borosilicates can be prepared by various techniques. In general, they are prepared by adding a silica source, a boron source, and a crystallizing agent to an aqueous medium and subjecting the resulting mixture to a hydrothermal reaction. For example, ammonium type crystal line borosilicate is generally prepared as follows Solution A, an aqueous solution containing boric acid, concentrated sulfuric acid, and tetrapropylammonium bromide, Solution B, an aqueous solution of water glass comprising silicon oxide, sodium oxide, and water , andSolution C, an aqueous solution of sodium chloride, are prepared separately. Solutions A and B were added dropwise to Solution C. The resulting mixture is, if necessary, adjusted in pH and heated in an autoclave.Then the mixture is cooled, washed, dried and calcined to prepare sodium type crystalline borosilicate. This sodium type crystalline borosilicate is further treated with an aqueous solution of ammonium nitrate to prepare ammonium type crystalline borosilicate. The thusprepared borosilicate is in a powdery form if desired, it can be molded by adding a binder such as alumina sol. Component B of the catalyst as used herein is a compound containing at least one element selected from the group consisting of Group IIa elements of thePeriodic Table, Group IIIa elements of the Periodic Table, silicon, and phosphorus. As Component B , any compounds can be used as long as they contain at least one element as described above. A typical example of Component B is silicon oxide.This silicon oxide may be deposited on or merely mixed with Component A of crystalline borosilicate. A catalyst comprising crystalline borosilicate with silicon oxide deposited thereon can be prepared by various techniques. It is preferred to employ a method in which the crystalline borosilicate is impregnated with an organosilicon compound and, thereafter, calcined. As organosilicon compounds, various compounds can be used as long as they are converted into silicon oxide when calcined after impregnation. In general, organosilane, alkyl silicate, organosiloxane, and so forth are used. Of these compounds, tetraethyl silicate7 diphenylsilicon, methylphenylsilicon, dimethylsilicon, and so forth are preferred.Particularly preferred are organosilicon compounds containing one silicon atom in the molecule, such as alkyl .silicate, e.g., tetraethyl silicate and tetramethyl silicate, and organosilane, e.g., trimethylchlorosilane and dimethyldichlorosilane. Various methods can be used to impregnate the crystalline borosilicate with the organosilicon compounds as described above. Usually the organosilicon compound is dissolved in an inactive organic solvent such as n hexane and the crystalline borosilicate is soaked in the thus prepared solution. The amount of the organosilicon compound used in the impregnation treatment is not critical it can be determined appropriately depending on conditions. It is, as calculated as the amount of silicon oxide deposited, usually from 0.05 to 50 parts by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 25 parts by weight, and more preferably from 1 to 5 parts per 100 parts by weight of the crystalline borosilicate.. As described above, the crystalline borosilicate with silicon oxide deposited thereon can be prepared by impregnating the crystalline borosilicate with a predetermined amount of organosilicon compound and calcining the resulting mixture at a temperature of from about 550 to about 9000C. This is molded as such or, if necessary, after adding a binder such as alumina sol to form the desired catalyst. Another example of Component B is a phosphorus compound. In the case of this phosphorus compound, it may be merely mixed with Component A of crystalline borosilicate. It is, however, preferred for the phosphorus compound to be deposited on the crystalline borosilicate. Phosphorus compounds which can be used include phosphoric acid phosphates such as ammonium phosphate, sodium. phosphate, and potassium phosphate alkyl phosphates such as methyl phosphate, ethyl phosphate, propyl phosphate, and butyl phosphate phosphorus oxychloride phosphorus trichloride phosphorus pentachloride alkyl phosphite such as methyl phosphite and ethyl phosphite metaphosphoric acid pyrophosphoric acid polyphosphoric acid and hydrogenphosphate such as aluminum hydrogenphosphate, sodium hydrogenphosphate, potassium hydrogenphosphate, and ammonium hydrogenphosphate. These phosphorus compounds can be deposited on the crystalline borosilicate by various techniques, such as a method in which the phosphorus compound and the crystalline borosilicate are mixed in a predetermined ratio, a method in which a crystalline borosilicate powder or mold is impregnated with a predetermined amount of solution of phosphorus compound, and a method in which after application of an ion exchange method as used in the preparation of modified zeolite, the resulting mass is calcined at a temperature of from 500 to 1,0000C. In a case in which a crystalline borosilicate powder is used, a phosphorus compound is deposited thereon and, thereafter, if desired, a binder such as alumina sol is added thereto. In this way, the final catalyst can be molded. The amount of the phosphorus compound being deposited is not critical and can be determined appropriately. It is, as calculated as diphosphorus pentoxide P205 , usually from 0.1 to 40 parts by weight, preferably from 1 to 20 parts by weight, and more preferably from 2 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of crystalline borosilicate. It is effective to deposit a boron compound on the crystalline borosilicate in combination with the phosphorus compound as described above. Boron compounds which can be used include boric acid, ammonium borate,.alkyl borate, metaboric acid, and tetraboric acid. In a case in which both the phosphorus compound and boron compound are deposited on the crystalline borosilicate, the amount of the phosphorus compound calculated as diphosphorus pentoxide P2O being deposited is from 1 to 40 parts by weight, preferably from 2 to 20 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the crystalline borosilicate, and the amount of the boron compound calculated as diboron trioxide B203 being deposited is from 1 to 40 parts by weight, preferably from 2 to 20 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the crystalline borosilicate. Various techniques can be employed to deposit both the phosphorus compound and boron compound on the crystalline borosilicate. A preferred method involves depositing a boron compound on crystalline borosilicate by techniques such as impregnation and calcining the resulting mass, and subsequently further depositing a phosphorus compound thereon, for example, by impregnation and then calcining the resulting mass. Another example of Component B is a compound ofGroup IIa metal, such as beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium or barium, of the Periodic Table. Of these compounds, magnesium or calcium compounds are preferred.Although there are a number of compounds containingGroup IIa metals of the Periodic Table, those compounds are preferred which exist in the form of oxide in the final catalyst. Examples are various salts of the metals belonging to Group IIa of the Periodic Table, such as inorganic acid salts e.g., nitric acid salts, sulfuric acid salts, and chlorides . Typical examples of such inorganic acid salts include calcium sulfate and magnesium nitrate. In addition, organic acid salts, such as calcium acetate, magnesium acetate, calcium formate, and magnesium formate, hydroxides, such as magnesium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide, and so forth can be used. Although the compound of Group IIa metal of thePeriodic Table may be merely mixed with the crystalline borosilicate, it is preferred to be deposited on the crystalline borosilicate. Another example of Component B is a compound ofGroup IIIa metal e.g., boron, aluminum, gallium, indium or thallium of the Periodic Table. Of these compounds, the compounds of boron, aluminum, and gallium are preferred. Those compounds are preferred which exist in the form of oxide in the final catalyst. For example, the salts or hydroxides of the metals belonging to Group IIIa of the Periodic Table can be used. The compound of Group IIa or IIIa metal of thePeriodic Table can be deposited on the crystalline borosilicate by various techniques. This deposition is usually achieved by impregnating the crystalline borosilicate with an aqueous solution of the compound as described above or by applying ion exchange. The ratio of the compound of Group IIa or IIIa metal of the PeriodicTable to the crystalline borosilicate is not critical and can be determined appropriately taking into account various conditions. In general, the ratio of the metal compound calculated as an oxide to the crystalline borosilicate is from 0.05 100 to 50 100 by weight and preferably from 1 100 to 25 100 by weight . The metal compound is introduced into the crystalline borosilicate by impregnation or ion exchange, for example, calcined, and if necessary, a binder such as alumina sol is added thereto.By molding the resulting mixture, the desired catalyst can be obtained. It is effective to add the compound of Group IIa or IIIa metal of the Periodic Table as described, particularly a calcium compound, a magnesium compound or a gallium compound in combination with a boron compound or a phosphorus compound. Boron compounds which can be used include ammonium borate and alkyl borate as well as boric acid. As phosphorus compounds, the compounds as described above, for example, phosphoric acid and phosphate can be used. In accordance with the process of the present invention, benzene or toluene is methylated by the use of a catalyst comprising Component A of crystalline borosilicate and Component B to produce para xylene in a high selectivity. This methylation can be performed by either of a flow method and a batch method. In either case, para xylene can be produced in a high selectivity and a high yield. The starting material used in the present invention is benzene or toluene in particular, toluene is preferred to use. In this methylation, a suitable methylating agent, such as methyl alcohol, dimethyl ether, methyl chloride, and methyl bromide, should be used. In particular, methyl alcohol and dimethyl ether are preferred. Conditions for the methylation of benzene or toluene in the presence of the catalyst containing Components A and B as major ingredients can be determined appropriately depending on various situations. The reaction temperature is usually from 200 to 7000C and preferably from 400 to 6500C the reaction pressure is usually from atmospheric pressure to 100 kilograms per square centimeter by gauge and preferably from atmospheric pressure to 10 kilograms per square centimeter by gauge the weight hourly space velocity WHSV is usually from 1 to 1,000 per hour, preferably from 1 to 200 per hour, and more preferably from 1 to 15 per hour and the molar ratio of the starting material, benzene or toluene, to the methylating agent is usually from 1 5 to 20 1 and preferably from 1 1 to 10 1.When toluene and methyl alcohol are used as the starting material and methylating agent, respectively, the molar ratio of toluene to methyl alcohol is usually from 1 5 to 10 1 and preferably from 1 2 to 4 1. If the methylation reaction is performed in an atmosphere containing hydrogen gas, the activity of the catalyst can be maintained at a high level over a long period of time. It is also effective that steam is introduced into the reaction system and the methylation reaction is performed in the presence of the steam. The amount of steam being introduced into the reaction system is not critical and can be determined appropriately taking into account various conditions. In general, the steam is introduced in an amount equimolar to or more than the methylating agent. In this case, it is preferred that the pressure of the steam to be introduced is slightly higher than the reaction pressure and the temperature of the steam is near the reaction temperature, since a variation in the pressure of the reaction system can be reduced By performing the methylation reaction in the presence of steam, the service life of the catalyst used can be greatly increased. The above described effect resulting from the introduction of steam in the reaction system is remarkable particularly when a catalyst prepared using the compound of Group IIa metal of the Periodic Table as Component B is used. The reason is as follows carbon precipitated on the catalyst during the methylation reaction undergoes a water gas reaction in combination with the steam. This water gas reaction is accelerated particularly by the compound of Group IIa metal of the PeriodicTable. As a result, even if the methylation reaction is performed continuously for a long period of time, the deposition of carbon on the catalyst does not occur and the activity of the catalyst is maintained. Some of the. major advantages of the present invention are 1 para xylene can be produced in a high selectivity and a high yield 2 the service life of the catalyst is very long and 3 therefore, the methylation reaction can be performed continuously for a long period of time while maintaining a high catalytic activity. Hence the process of the present invention is very useful as an industrial method of production of paraxylene and is of high practical value. The present invention is described in greater detail with reference to the following Reference Example,Examples, and Comparative Example.
