# Fluid infusion system.

## Abstract
A fluid infusion system 10 includes a selector valve 12 for convenient interruption of administration of a primary infusion fluid to a patient to permit administration of a secondary infusion fluid, such as a selected drug solution, followed by resumption of primary fluid flow. The selector valve 12 includes a valve housing 32 with a primary spike 36 for connection to a primary fluid container, a dual path secondary spike 44 for connection to a vial or the like containing the secondary infusion fluid, and an outlet fitting 54 for connection to the patient, for example, through a standard intravenous IV infusion set 26 . A valve insert 60 is movably mounted within the valve housing 32 and defines a fluid channel network for controlling flow from the primary and secondary spikes 36, 44 to the outlet fitting 54 . In one form, the valve insert 60 movable between a first position routing the primary infusion fluid directly from the primary spike 36 to the outlet fitting 54 for supply to the patient, and a second position routing the primary infusion fluid through the secondary spike 44 and the vial to wash the secondary infusion fluid therefrom through the outlet fitting 54 for flow to the patient.
