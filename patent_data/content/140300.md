# METHOD AND DEVICE FOR SCALDING A CARCASS

## Abstract
A method and a device for scalding a pig. A warm, humid airflow is directed against the carcass from below or from the sides thereof. The air is circulated by a circulation fan 9 through an inlet channel 4 against the pig body 2 to an outlet channel 5 and then to a conditioning channel 6 , in which the air is heated and humidified. Sensors 13, 14 control a heating element 7 and a humidifier 8 so that the inlet air has a temperature of about 62 C and a relative humidity exceeding about 80 . The moisture is condensated against the carcass and heats is rapidly. The device is constructed of light sandwich elements.
