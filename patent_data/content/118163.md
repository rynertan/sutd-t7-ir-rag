## Description
METHOD FOR BIOTECHNOLOGICALLY PREPARING OPTICALLY ACTIVE a CYANO 3 PHENOXYBENZYL ALCOHOL The present invention relates to a method for biotechnologically preparing optically active a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol. More particularly, it relates to a method for preparing optically active a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol which is rich in S isomer hereinafter referred to as S rich alcohol , characterized by that an ester of R,S acyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol of the formula I EMI1.1 wherein R is alkoxyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, alkenyloxy group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, alkynyloxy group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, halogen substituted alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, halogen substituted alkenyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, halogen substituted alkynyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, carboxyl group, hydroxycarbonylalkyl group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms which may be substituted with lower alkyl group or halogen atom, hydroxycarbonylalkenyl group having 3 to 4 carbon atoms which may be substituted with lower alkyl group or halogen atom, or hydroxycarbonylalkynyl group having 3 to 4 carbon atoms which may be substituted with lower alkyl group or halogen atom, is allowed to react with an esterase originated from a microorganism, an animal pancreas or liver, which is capable of asymmetrically hydrolyzing the ester of the formula I , at pH not higher than 7 to asymmetrically hydrolyze the said ester to give the S rich alcohol . a Cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol has been known as a novel alcohol moiety of a series of ester compounds of synthetic pyrethroids, having superior insecticidal activity. The synthetic pyrethroids, typically, fenvalerate, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, etc., which have the said alcohol as their alcohol moiety, are good insecticides not only for household and sanitary uses but even for agricultural use, since they provide the durability against the sun light together with their leaping increase in the effectiveness. Thus, the importance of this a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol is more increasing. Now, a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol has an asymmetric carbon at its a position, accordingly having two kinds of optical isomers, i.e. S and R isomers.When they are derived to the esters, it has been known that the insecticidal activity of the ester from the S isomer alcohol is far superior to that from the R isomer alcohol. see Hirosuke Yoshioka Journal ofSynthetic Organic Chemistry, Japan, Vol. 38, No. 12, pages 1151 1162, 1980 . Therefore, the development of a commercially advantageous technology is desirable in an optical resolution of R,S a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol, which is prepared according to the conventional method of synthetic chemistry, in order to obtain the S isomer. While, a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol is an unstable compound. Thus, the conventional optical resolution process for alcohol which is effected via an ester or a half ester with an ordinary optically active organic acid may not be advantageous for it.As the methods to obtain S a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol, the following methods have been known 1 a method wherein desired S a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol is obtained by reacting R,S a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol with cis 2,2 dimethyl 3 S dihydroxymethyl cyclopropane l R carboxylic acid lactone in the presence of an acidic reagent to obtain an ether compound, separating the resulting mixture of two kinds of the isomers each other according to a physical means, and hydrolysing the ether compound containing S isomer alcohol component in an acidic medium see Japanese Unexamined Published Patent Application No. 109944 1979 and 2 a method wherein S a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol is obtained by reacting an S a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol ester of a chiral cyclopropanecarboxylic acid with a boron halide and then with water see Japanese Unexamined Published PatentApplication No. 12355 1981 . In these methods, however, the processes are complicated and need an expensive optically active reagent, besides, with not so high overall yield.Furthermore, in the method 2 , the optically active a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol ester has to be prepared in advance. From these points, the methods heretofore known can not necessarily be said satisfactory ones. After the studies to overcome these difficulties and to seek a commercially advantageous method for preparing S a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol, the present inventors have found that S rich alcohol can be produced efficiently from an ester of the formula I , as the starting material, and asymmetrically hydrolyzing it according to a biotechnological process.Thus, they have accomplished the present invention based upon such findings, with the other results of various further investigations. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for preparing the S rich alcohol , wherein an ester of the formula I is subjected to asymmetric hydrolysis using an esterase originated from a microorganism or an animal pancreas or liver, which is capable of asymmetrically hydrolyzing the ester of the S a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol predominantly, at pH not higher than 7 to asymmetrically hydrolyze the ester, thereby to give the S rich alcohol and the ester of R n cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol. Hereunder, the present invention will be described in detail. The term esterase used herein is of their broader meaning including lipase having activity to a water insoluble substrate. The esterases employable in the present invention are those capable of asymmetrically hydrolyzing the ester of the S a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol predominantly and they are originated from microorganisms and from animal pancreases of livers. More in detail, when the ester of the formula I3 which is employed as the starting material in the present invention is the carbonic acid ester, i.e., whenR is alkoxyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, alkenyloxy group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms or alkynyloxy group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms in the ester of formula I , the employable esterases are the esterases originated from microorganisms of genuses illustrated below Arthrobacter, Achromobacter, Pseudomonas,Chromobacterium, Bacillus, Brevibacterium, Nocardia,Rhodotorula, Candida, Trichoderma, Rhizopus, Mucor,Aspergillus, Geotricum, Aureobasidium, Hansenula,Torulopsis and Alcaligenes. When the ester of formula I is the ester of a halogen substituted organic carboxylic acid, i.e. whenR is halogen substituted alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, halogen substituted alkenyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms or halogen substituted alkynyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, the employable esterases are the esterases originated from an animal pancreas or livers or microorganisms of genuses illustrated below Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas, Chromobacterium,Bacillus, Candida, Nocardia, Rhodotorula, Brevibacterium,Trichoderma, Rhizopus, Mucor, Aspergillus, Geotricum,Hansenula, Enterobacter, Flavobacterium, Mycobacterium,Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus, Streptmyces, Penicillium,Actinomucor, Gibberella, Absidia, Cunninghamella,Gliocladium, Saccharomyces, Cryptococcus, Pichia, Micrococcus, Torulopsis, Aureobasidium, Alcalienes andAchromobacter. In these microorganisms, in particular, the microorganisms belonging to genuses Arthrobacter, Achromobacter, Pseudomonas,Chromobacterium, Bacillus, Brevibacterium, Nocardia,Rhodotorula, Candida, Trichoderma, Rhizopus, Mucor,Aspergillus, Geotricum, Aureobasidium, Hansenula andTorulopsis, are preferred from viewpoints of optical selectivity and ability of hydrolysis. When the ester of the formula I is halfester, i.e., when R is carboxyl group, hydroxycarbonylalkyl group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms which may be substituted with lower alkyl group or halogen atom, hydroxycarbonyl alkenyl group having 3 to 4 carbon atoms which may be substituted with lower alkyl group or halogen atom, or hydroxycarbonyl alkynyl group having 3 to 4 carbon atoms which may be substituted with lower alkyl group or halogen atom, the employable esterases are the esterases originated from microorganisms of genuses illustrated below Arthrobacter, Chromobacterium, Rhodotolura,Torulopsis, Hansenula and Candida.

Lipase PL No.679 Alcaligenes sp. I Steapsin Hog pancreas Tokyo Kasei The starting ester may easily be prepared according to the conventional esterification process.For example, the carbonic acid ester is prepared by allowing to react R,S a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol with alkyl chlorocarbonate,e.g., methyl chlorocarbonate, ethyl chlorocarbonate, propyl chlorocarbonate etc. The ester A of a halogen substituted organic carboxylic acid is prepared by allowing to react R,S a cyano 3phenoxybenzyl alcohol with an anhydride or a halide of such organic acid, preferably, an organic acid having 1 to 2 halogen atoms on the a position, more preferably, an organic acid having a chlorine or bromine atom on the a position, such as monochloroacetic acid, monobromoacetic acid etc. Alternatively, the A may be prepared by allowing to react 3 phenoxybenzaldehyde and sodium cyanide with a halide such organic carboxylic acid.The half ester is prepared by allowing to react R,S a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol with an anhydride of dicarboxylic acid, e.g., oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, maleic acid, fumalic acid or its substitution product with lower alkyl group or halogen atom, preferably succinic acid from the viewpoint of easiness in handling. In practicing the method of the present invention, the asymmetric hydrolysis of the ester of the formula I , is conducted by stirring or shaking vigorously a mixture of the said ester and an esterase containing liquor, such as cultured liquor of such microorganism, its filtrate, esterase extracted liquor and its concentrate, suspension of microorganism cells or aqueous solution containing crude or purified esterase preparation or animal pancreas or liver esterase preparation.If required, surfactant of non ester type may be added thereto. Alternatively, the enzyme may be employed in an immobilized state. In this process, the reaction temperature is suitably in a range of 100 to 650C. More preferable temperature is in a range of 20 to 500C, since the resulting alcohol is comparatively unstable at a higher temperature and the reaction rate is low at a lower temperature. The period of time for the reaction is normally in a range of 0.5 to 48 hours, but it can be shortened at a higher reaction temperature or by use of an enzyme of high activity. It is essential to control the pH of the aqueous solution during the asymmetric hydrolysis reaction, because a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol tends to decompose especially by a basic substance. In a basic medium, the resulting alcohol is subjected to decomposition, though the asymmetric hydrolysis proceeds well by esterase. Accordingly, the hydrolysis reaction should be conducted at not higher than pH 7. While, too low pH tends to cause the deactivation of enzymes. Thus, it is preferred that the reaction is conducted in the range of pH 3.5 to pH 6.3. Further, if necessary, a buffer solution may be used to prevent the lowering of pH value due to the formation of an organic acid during the course of hydrolysis. As the buffer solution, either inorganic or organic acid salt buffer may be employed. The concentration of the ester employed as the substrate may be in the range of 1 to 80 w w , preferably 5 to 35 w w , of the reaction mixture. Then, after the asymmetric hydrolysis reaction, the S rich alcohol and the unreacted ester of the antipode are separated from the reaction mixture. For that purpose, solvent extraction, liquid phase separation by standing, column chromatography or other procedures, can be adequately employed. For example, the reaction mixture may be extracted with an organic solvent, such as ether, benzene, toluene, etc., and the extract is subjected to a column chromatography using, for example, silica gel etc. to isolate 11 S rich alcohol . On the other hand, the unreacted ester thus separated may be used again as the starting material of the method of the present invention after the epimerization by contact with a basic compound, such as ammonia, pyridine, triethylamine, etc. Hereunder, the present invention will be more fully described by means of the following examples, which, however, should not be construed to be limitative.Examples 1 to 8 To 15 mQ of 0.2 M concentration of an acetate buffer solution pH 4.0 were added 2.0 g of R,S acyano 3 phenoxybenzyl ethylcarbonate and each 40 mg of an esterase illustrated in Table 1. The mixture was stirred at 400C for 24 hours. And then, the reaction mixture was extracted with toluene. The extract was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography HPLC Lichrosorb RP 18, MeOH water 6 4 , 254 nm, W detection , and the rate of the hydrolysis was calculated from the peak area ratio of unreacted a cyano 3phenoxybenzyl ethylcarbonate and free cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol.The toluene extract was concentrated, and subjected to a silica gel chromatography and eluted with cyclohexane diethyl ether 95 5 mixture to isolate the unaltered ethylcarbonate of a cyano 3phenoxybenzyl alcohol, followed by being removed. The column was then eluted with methanol containing a trace l0 of p toluenesulfonic acid, to obtain the solution of free a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol. After removing the solvent from the elute, 10 mg of the obtained free a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol was dissolved in 1 mQ of toluene, and reacted with the equal mole amount of S 2 4 chlorophenyl isovaleric acid chloride in the presence of pyridine to convert it to a diastereomer of a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl S 2 4 chlorophenyl isovalerate, which was analyzed for the optical isomer ratio by gas chromatography 10 DCQF 1, 2.5 m, 250 C .
