# Improvements in or relating to methods of and apparatuses for determining opening of injectors.

## Abstract
In order to determine the opening of a fuel injector of, for instance, a compression ignition engine, an electro acoustic transducer such as a contact microphone monitors the acoustic waves produced by the injector. A monitoring circuit detects when the level of the output signals of the transducer increases, this increase being indicative of open ing of the injector. By comparing the opening time of the injector with the position of the crankshaft, the timing of the engine can be checked without requiring dismantling.

## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO METHODS OF AND APPARATUSES FOR DEEERMINING OPENING OF INJECTORS The present invention relates to methods of and apparatuses for determining opening of injectors. Such methods and apparatuses may be used for determining when an injector of a compression ignition engine opens. By compairing this opening time with the position of the engine crankshaft, it is possible to check the timing of the engine without having to dismantle the engine to inspect the drive to the injector arrangement. According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of determining opening of an injector, comprising applying an electro acoustic transducer to the injector and monitoring the level of the output signal of the transducer to detect an increase therein indicative of opening of the injector. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus for determining opening of an injector, comprising an electro acoustic transducer arranged to be applied to the injector and a monitoring circuit arranged to monitor the level of the output signal of the transducer to detect an increase therein indicative of opening of the injector. The transducer may comprise a contact transducer arranged to be in contact with the injector. The contact transducer may be a contact microphone, for instance of the piezo electric type which is sufficiently rugged and reliable for this type of use. Alternatively the transducer may be a directional microphone not actually in contact with the injector. In the case of a fuel injector of a compression ignition or diesel engine, the sudden flow of fuel through the injector when it opens to inject fuel into a cylinder of the engine produces acoustic waves which propagate in the metal body of the injector. The transducer receives these waves and converts them into an electrical signal whose level, at least at some frequencies, increases when the injector opens. Thus, the time or rise of the amplitude of this signal corresponds to the time when the injector opens. The monitoring circuit monitors the output signal of the transducer, in particular the level thereof, and provides a signal indicative of the increase in amplitude corresponding to the opening of the injector. The monitoring circuit may include a filter allowing signals of frequencies corresponding to the sound produced by the injector when open to be preferentially amplified, thus increasing the signal to noise ratio or sensitivity of the monitoring circuit. Even when the engine is running normally and is thus producing a substantial amount of background noise, the monitoring circuit is still able to distinguish the acoustic waves produced by opening of the injector so as to produce a signal indicative of this opening.Thus the output signal from the transducer may be filtered so as to exclude noise or acoustic waves generated in other parts of the engine, thus permitting acoustic waves whose frequency is associated with the opening of the injector to be preferentially amplified. It has been found that the acoustic waves associated with the opening of an injector have relatively high frequency. It is possible to use frequencies up to and in the region of 400 KHz. The use of frequencies in the region of 40 KHz has been found to be particularly advantageous. Accordingly, it is preferable for the output of the transducer to be filtered so as to pass signals having frequencies in such regions while suppressing or substantially reducing output signals whose frequencies lie outside these regions. Thus, a band pass filter, preferably having a centre frequency of approximately 40 KHz, may be connected to the output of the transducer. This permits more accurate detection of the opening of the injector in the presence of noise which is generated when the engine is being tested. In general, such noise has frequency components which lie outside these regions and thus may be removed or reduced sufficiently to allow a clear determination of opening of the injector to be made. Even when the noise has components, for instance, in the region of 40 KHz, it is still possible, for instance by arranging the transducer so as to be specifically sensitive to the acoustic waves produced by the injector while being much less sensitive to noise from other sources, to provide a signal with a sufficiently good signal to noise ratio to allow the opening of the injector to be reliably and accurately determined. In a particularly simple embodiment of the invention, the transducer is attached to the injector bymeans of a spring clip. This has been found in practice to provide an adequate attachment of the transducer to the injector, and provides a quick, simple, cheap and convenient means of attachment, allowing the transducer to be readily detached when desired. The method and apparatus may be used in conjunction with means for determining the position of a piston or crankshaft of an internal combustion engine so that the timing of the engine can be checked. In cases where there is no mark on a flywheel of the engine indicating top dead centre of one of the pistons, the top dead centre position can be determined by a method and apparatus as disclosed in our copending application No. reference 230P41477X entitled Improvements in or relating to methods of and apparatuses for indicating a predetermind position of a piston or crankshaft of a piston engine so that the engine timing can be checked without requiring any dismantling of the engine. The engine timing can thus be checked in a very quick and convenient manner.
