# LOCAL TEMPERATURE RISE MONITOR FOR ELECTRICAL APPARATUS

## Abstract
An electrical apparatus arranged in a hermetically sealed container is provided with a tracer container 17 which fuses at a given temperature, and a tracer substance 18 capable of being detected with a detecting means is enclosed in the tracer container 17 . Since the temperature to be detected can be determined according to the tracer container 17 , even if the temperature to be detected changes, it is possible to use the same tracer substance 18 and the same detecting means as arranged so as to be desirable for the electrical apparatus.
