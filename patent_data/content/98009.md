# Memory storage apparatus having improved housing and base plate arrangement.

## Abstract
A fixed disc drive type of memory storage devices includes an annular elastomeric pad 100 that is engaged between the actuator base plate 32 and a bowl shaped lower casing 12 . The pad 100 is concentric with the spindle axis 80 and forms an air tight seal at the edge of a circular opening 12a in the lower casing 12 that prevents dust from entering the housing. The base plate 32 has a circular platform portion with the hub 36 for the spindle shaft 80 being formed at its center. The circular form of the opening and platform portion are such that any temperature differential across the lower housing induces an oil canning type of deformation in the base plate 32 so that the spindle 80 does not tilt relative to the plane of motion of the transducers.
