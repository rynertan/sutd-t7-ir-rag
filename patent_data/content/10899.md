## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to an improved process for reducing solute concentration in a vapor stream and particularly to concentrating dilute solutions particularly of corrosive products.2. Description of the Prior Art US Patent 3,970,511 discloses a process for concentrating dilute solutions of corrosive products such as sulfuric or phosphoric acid. In the process the dilute solutions are pre concentrated solution is introduced into a tunnel in which it flows in thin layer over successive cascades while being heated by an indirect radiant heating element. US 3,191,662 discloses a continuous solution concentrator wherein feed is introduced into the top of an evaporator and passed through a nozzle. The resulting droplets then are heated by a surface with evaporation of volatile solvent. Near the bottom of the evaporator there is a mist eliminator pad which serves to coalesce the falling droplets and permit discharge from the column as a concentrated bottoms fraction. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In a basic process for concentrating a solution in an evaporator, the steps typically comprise heating the solution to a temperature sufficient to evaporate volatile solvent, collecting the vapor rich in volatile solvent as an overhead fraction, and collecting a concentrated solution as a bottoms fraction. It has also been common practice to utilize a mist eliminator pad in the evaporator to reduce carry over of entrained product in the overhead. The entrained droplets coalesce on inpingement with the pad and are then removed prior to discharge of the overhead fraction.The improvement constituting the basis of this invention, which serves to enhance the efficiency of the evaporator by reducing the quantity of vaporized product solute collected with the overhead vapor, comprises spraying a liquid selected from the group consist ing of solvent or solution through the mist eliminator pad at a rate of from 0.6 2.5 pounds liquid per pound of vapor, the liquid being sprayed substantially uni formly over the mist eliminator pad surface to provide a wetting rate of about 0.1 0.35, preferably 0.15 0.25 gallons per minute gpm per sq ft of mist eliminator pad surface and utilizing as said mist eliminator pad, a knitted wire mesh mist eliminator pad having a wire diameter from 0.001 0.05 wire, an interfacial area from 50 200 ft2 ft3, a void space of 90 99 percent and a thickness of from 4 16 inches. There are several advantages associated with using the mist eliminator pad of the type described as a medium for scrubbing product from the vapor passing through the mist eliminator pad. These advantages include a simple and efficient method for reducing the quantity of solute product in the vapor overhead from the evaporator an ability to reduce the amount of product in the vapor with very low pressure drop and thus with low energy cost the ability to reduce the amount of product in the vapor overhead without a substantial energy cost due to an increased heat load in the evaporator an ability to utilize a unique scrubbing system which can be utilized in existing equipment, e.g. distillation columns and evaporators without resort to separate units and an ability to achieve good efficiency in removal of product with a very small amount of a packing n material. THE DRAWING The figure is a cross sectional view of an evaporator showing the combination of a mist eliminator pad and a spray device for effecting scrubbing of the vapor phase prior to collecting it as overhead product. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The process of this invention for reducing solute concentrations in vapor streams can be utilized in many ways, e.g., concentrating a variety of solutions, particularly those where a solute product is dissolved in a volatile solvent, e.g. an organic solvent or water. However, the process has particular advantage in concentrating solutions of sulfuric acid in water and particularly at the higher concentrations, e.g., 81 91 , where sulfuric acid concentration in the overhead may range from 1 15 by weight. To illustrate the usefulness of the process reference is made to the figure in describing the following concentration process. With respect to the figure, evaporator unit 2 has a body section 4 and a preheat section 6. Feed sulfuric acid, sulfuric acid being the solute and water the solvent, is introduced to evaporator 2 and to preheat section 6 through line 8. Steam is introduced through line 10 to coils 12 and then removed via line 14. The evaporator is further characterized as having a mist eliminator pad 16 disposed in body 4, and is carried by supports 18 and 20. Its function is to effect coalescence of entrained droplets in the vapor phase prior to exhaustion of the vapor through overhead 22. A steam eductor 23 and condenser 24 water lines now shown are utilized to maintain a partial vacuum and facilitate removal of vapor. The vapor from evaporator 2 is condensed in condenser 24 with the vapor being exhausted through line 26 and liquid through line 28.A circulation cycle is maintained in the evaporator with preconcentrated liquid being passed from the body 4 to pre heat section 6 via line 29 with the rate of circulation being controlled by valve 30. A concentrated product is removed from body 4 through line 32 with the rate being controlled by valve 34. Although the above description of the evaporator and its operation are conventional to prior art concentration processes, it is the combination of a particular mist eliminator pad 16 and operation of flow distribution device 38 in accordance with this invention that permits enhanced recovery of product with minimal losses to overhead. The mist eliminator pad is one which, of course, should be constructed of a material that is inert to the solution vapor or solvent. In the case of sulfuric acid, which is corrosive, the preferred material is tantalum. The mist eliminator pad preferably consists of a multi filament, knitted wire mesh pad having a wire diameter of from 0.001 0.05 inches, and preferably a diameter of about 0.004 0.006. In terms of properties, the mist eliminator pad has an interfacial area of from about 50 200 ft2 ft3, a void space of about 90 99.7 percent, and a density of 3 40 lbs ft3. In a preferred case the pad is formed from a knitted tube which is flattened, crimped and then assembled into parallel layers of interlocked wire loops. The thickness of the mist eliminator pad can vary from about 4 16 inches but preferably a thickness of about 6 10 inch is used. Although most of the mist eliminator pads have a thickness of at least four inches, it is conceivable that pads one or two inches thick could be used in combination to meet the thickness of 4 16 inches. Accordingly, when used in combination, it is the combined total thickness that is deemed to be the thickness of the pad. When the interfacial area falls below about 50 sq ft per cu ft of pad, there generally is insufficient surface area to permit removal of entrained droplets, and there is insufficient surface area to permit scrubbing contact with vaporized solute product. On the other hand, as the interfacial area exceeds about 200 ft per cu ft of pad, the pressure drop becomes too high and thus results in increased energy consumption. Scrubbing of the vapor stream to reduce solute product in the vapour is accomplished by means of a flow distributor 38. It comprises an elongated tube having a plurality of cross bars in ladder arrangement with a feed inlet 40 through which the scrubbing liquid is passed. A plurality of holes 42 are placed in the elongated tube and cross members for discharge of the scrubbing liquid dashed line from holes 42 . The flow distributor 38 can be of virtually any design, the important factor being that the liquid is uniformly sprayed over mist eliminator pad 16. In the embodiment shown, the holes are substantially uniformly placed in flow distributor 38 for even distribution of liquid with a hole generally being placed approximately every 7 20 sq ft of pad surface. The hole diameter is determined by calculating the surface area of the pad and then determining how many holes are to be utilized. Uniform liquid distribution through each hole should be achieved, and this can be done by designing the hole diameter so that the pressure drop of the scrubbing liquid through the hole is at least ten times that of the pressure required to establish the appropriate scrubbing liquid feed rate through feed inlet 40. Typically, in operation, the liquid rate through feed inlet 40 is from about 0.6 2.5 Ibs per lb of vapor rising through mist eliminator pad 16.In a preferred case, the liquid rate is about 0.9 1.2 and, preferably, the rate is 1 1 as this is the level where minimum energy is required for the system. Thus, in many cases, the hole diameter will be from about 0.02 0.08 inches in diameter. The liquid which can be used for scrubbing can be pure solvent or a solution of the solvent and solute product. Of course, as expected, the efficiency of the liquid for scrub bing is much greater when the concentration of solute product in the solvent is low. On the other hand, the heat load to the evaporator is increased as the concentration of the solution is reduced because of the increased concentration of solvent that must be evaporated. For purposes of sulfuric acid concentration from 88 93 , the liquid for scrubbing should be from about 60 75 sulfuric acid. This feed concentration provides enough concentration gradient to establish good efficiency in scrubbing without encountering substantial heat load in the evaporator. However, as mentioned, the solvent or solution can be varied in concentration as desired. The liquid passing through the flow distribution device can be directed in cocurrent or countercurrent relationship to the vapor flow through the pad. Preferably, the flow is countercurrent to the vapor flow as greater efficiency in separation is achieved. The following examples are provided to illustrate preferred embodiments of the inventions are not intended to restrict the scope thereof. EXAMPLE 1 The process of this invention can be adapted to a conventional sulfuric acid concentration process as described. In a typical sulfuric acid concentration plant wherein the initial feed sulfuric acid is about 70 percent and the final desired concentration is about 93 95 percent, multi stage evaporators are utilized. Typically, these stages operate at pressures between 10 to 90 mm of Hg, and at temperatures from 250 32 F. The last evaporator stage in the above described sulfuric acid concentration process was modified as shown in the figure. That stage was adapted with a York 325 tantalum mist eliminator pad having a thick ness of 8 inches, a void space of 99 , an interfacial surface area of 110 sq ft per cu ft. The York 325 mist eliminator pad is made of 0.005 inch diameter wire screen and is formed by knitting the wire into a tube, crimping and then forming into a segmented layer pad. A flow distributor consisting of a central elongated tube with ladder tubes being placed perpendicular to the central elongated tube was constructed and mounted above the mist eliminator pad. The ladder tubes, of course, were cut to the appropriate dimension to form a circular structure and assure that the total surface of the mist eliminator could be sprayed uniformly with a scrubbing medium. The holes were placed to provide one hole per 9 sq inches of pad surface area. A series of experiments were run and the results of the tests are given in Table 1. During the test period, a 70 sulfuric acid feed was used to scrub the vapor prior to extrusion through overhead 22. The feed temperature, the spray rate in gallons per minute corresponds to a wetting rate in gpm per square feet of pad surface and the liquid rate was varied. The feed sulfuric acid was about 89 . The results are shown in Table 1.

At this flow rate, the energy consumption is minimized since lb of liquid is being introduced for every lb of vapor being removed.Run 6 is also exemplary of similar test conditions except there the feed temperature has been increased. Quite surprisingly, scrubbing in the specified manner through the mist eliminator pad transformed the pad into a relatively efficient packed column which achieved substantial removal of the sulfuric acid solute from the vapor phase or rather achieved substantial scrubbing efficiency. By operating under the conditions shown, particularly as a wetting rate of about 0.13 0.2 gpm ft2 the number of theoretical units NTU calculated was about 1.4. Thus, the height of the theoretical unit HTU of the pad was calculated to be about 5.6 inches which is extremely good. The surprising factor about an HTU of 5.6 inches is that it was achieved with a packing of only 8 inches in thickness. Typically, in scrubbing operations utilizing a conventional packing material with conventional liquid loadings, an HTU of 5 to 6 inches is achieved when the packing is several feet thick. If the top 8 to 10 inch portion of these columns were evaluated the NTU would be a small fraction.
