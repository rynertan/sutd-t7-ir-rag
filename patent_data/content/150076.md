## Description
The invention relates to a converter for converting parallely presented pulse trains having a plurality of parallel inputs and comprising a combining arrangement having a plurality of inputs equal in number to the plurality of parallel inputs of the converter, and an output, each parallel input being coupled Such a converter is described in Instruments and Experimental Techniques , No. 2, March april 1968, pages 341 344. This known converter is a parallel parallel converter fo use in a coincidence anticoincidence circuit of circuit for registering pulses from a photo multiplier. In this known converter the short circuited transmission lines are used to influence the pulse duration and shape. In digital transmission systems it often happens that the wish is felt for converting In digital transmission systems it is normal practice to effect such parallel series conversion only with the aid of active digital circuits. These active circuits are integrated with further portions of the transmission system on, for example, a semiconductor body. The use of integrated active digital circuits increase the total required dissipation of the semiconductor body. This may cause design problems in connection with the maximum permissible dissipation of the semiconductor body. The invention therefore has for its object to implement the known converter as a parallel series converter, without the necessity to apply additinal active digital circuits, To this effect the invention is characterized in that the converter is a parallel series converter wherein the time delays of the individual transmission lines have respective different magnitudes according to an arithmetical progression that the short circuited transmission lines have a length λ 2, where λ is the wavelength of the desired output frequency of the parallel series converter that each original pulse, as applied to an input of the parallel series converter, is overlapped by the inverted pulse coming form the short circuited transmission line such, that the original pulse during the overlap time is wholly, or substantially wholly, eliminated, and in that the combining circuit comprises a blocking transistor whose collector is coupled to the output of the parallel series converter, whose emitter is coupled to the junction of the emitters of the aforesaid transistors, and whose base is connectable to a point of reference voltage, such that pulses with a fixed polarity are blocked and pulses with the opposite polarity appear at the output of the parallel series converter. By using in the converter according to the invention the short circuited transmission line, an inverted pulse is created that overlaps the original pulse substantially. Out of the original pulse two pulses of shorter duration are created with opposite polarities. These pulses for each input are delayed by means of a further transmission line with different time delays and combined in the combining circuit. For an error free operation of the converter pulses with one fixed polarity are blocked in the blocking circuit. So, The transmission lines are easily integratable and do not dissipate, which is of great advantage. It is observed that from IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science, Vol. NS 11, No. 2, April 1964, pages 10 to 15, a parallel series converter is known that converts a fixed number of pulses at the output. With the bitrate at the input and the bitrate at the output being the same, a minimun time of the number of parallel pulses multiplied by the duration of a single pulse must pass before another number of parallel pulses can be converted. Further, from US A 2,444,438 a pulse generator is known that cuts one pulse that is present at the input into a smaller one at the output by using a reflection network and clipping a selected portion of the resulting pulse energy. Both the known converter and the known generator have the same bitrate at the input and at the output. In a parallel series converter according to the invention, use is made predominantly of passive elements to effect the parallel series conversion. As a result, the additional dissipation due to the parallel series converter and added to the total dissipation is drastically reduced. The invention will now be described in greater detail by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which In the parallel series converter shown in Fig. 1, the parallel inputs are constituted by the terminals 31, 32 and 33 and the information is applied to these terminals by sources 1, 2 and 3. The input 31 is connected to a first input 41 of a combining arrangement I A digital signal, which is of the shape shown in Fig. 2a, is applied to the inputs of the parallel series converter. The widths of the pulses applied to the inputs are limited, such as described, for example, in United States Patent 3,515,995. This is necessary as otherwise loss of information would occur in the parallel series converter. In addition, negative reflection pulses are produced at the input of the short circuited transmission line, as shown in Fig. 2b. These reflection pulses are unwanted and are suppressed in the combining arrangement I with the aid of the transistor 20 and the reference voltage 16 source. In response thereto, the three parallel bit streams 1, 1, 1 , 1, 0, 1 and 0, 1, 1 appear in this succession at the inputs 31, 32 and 33. Due to the action of the respective short circuited transmission lines 10, 11 and 12, the pulse widths of the pulses from these parallel bit streams are limited as is shown in Fig. 2b. The three parallel bit streams of three bits each are thereafter applied to the inputs 41, 42 and 43 of the combining arrangement I. The transistors 17, 18, 19 and 20 together form a multiple OR gate. With the aid of the transistors 17, 18 and 19 the three parallel bit streams are arranged time sequentially as is shown in Fig. 2f. The emitter of the transistor 20 is adjusted to such a potential with the aid of the reference voltage source 16 that the above mentioned negative reflection pulses as shown in Fig. 2b are blocked and do not occur at the output 23 of the parallel series converter.
