# Fabric conditioning composition.

## Abstract
A fabric conditioning composition contains a fabric softening agent, which may be a cationic or nonionic material, and a polymeric drape imparting agent, such as a vinyl acetate vinyl chloride copolymer, in the form of positively charged thermoplastic particles having a softening point of 25 200 C, especially above 50 C. When treated fabrics are ironed above this softening temperature, the particles coalesce to form a drape imparting film on the fabric. Non ironed fabrics exhibit a softening benefit.
