# Hollow fiber assembly having selective permeability.

## Abstract
A hollow fiber assembly having selective permeability by cylindrical arrangements of hollow fibers having selective permeability mainly comprising a cylindrical layer of hollow fibers 1 formed by crisscross arrangement of hollow fibers, a hollow portion 2 which exists inside the above cylindrical layer of hollow fibers 1 , a plurality of engaging members 3 which are respectively separated from one another in said hollow portion 2 , a resin wall A 4 which is disposed at an open end of said hollow fibers and arranged to be open to the exterior without leaving any space between said fibers and with separation from said engaging means 3 , a resin wall B 5 which is disposed at the other end of said assembly for fixing the end of said assembly, an elastic supporting member 6 for controlling the distance between the two resin walls A 4 and B 5 , and a fluid supply conduit 8 .
