## Description
Polymers with excellent impact strength at ambient and very low temperatures are prepared by the polymerization in bulk liquid phase of a vinyl halide monomer and an olefin trunk polymer of hydrocarbon olefin monomers. The preparation of such polymers is disclosed in detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,071,582 4,163,033 and 4,169,870, to Takahashi. The process described in the above mentioned patents is primarily used at lower proportions of the polyolefin component, up to about 20 weight percent, and preferably up to about 10 weight percent. In the polymerization process, the reaction commences with the polyolefin component in solution or partial solution or dispersed in the vinyl monomer. As the reaction proceeds, the reaction mixture thickens to a latex like consistency. As the conversion progresses, the reaction mixture enters the paste stage where it has a dough like consistency. Near the end of the reaction, the polymer mass in the reactor breaks up into discrete particles, which are recovered as the final product. In this process, when the polyolefin component is employed at higher proportions, and when the reaction proceeds to the higher conversions, the reaction product in the thick paste stage does not readily break down Into particles. Accordingly, the process is not ordinarily used at proportions higher than about 20 weight percent of the polyolefin component. The preparation of graft copolymers of unsaturated monomers and polyolefins is also disclosed In U.S. Patent Nos. 3,289,821 and 3,489,822 to Witt et al. While these patents disclose the reaction of higher proportions of polyolefin, there is no enabling disclosure of the reaction being carried out in the bulk liquid phase. Thus, the patentees do not disclose the above described difficulty with respect to break down of the reaction mass from a dough like consistency to discrete particles. U.S. Patent No. 3,408,424 to Barkhuff discloses the reaction of vinyl chloride with polyolefins at higher proportions, but the enabling disclosure of this patent is limited to the suspension process and there is no teaching with respect to the bulk liquid phase process. Therefore, the patentees do not disclose encountering the above described problem with break down of a dough like mass into discrete particles. Barkhuff at col. 5, line 71, teaches that grafting can occur to particles of polyolefin if finely suspended even if not fully dissolved, but he further points out that large rubbery lumps will be evident in the product if dispersing conditions are such as to give more than a small amount of polyolefin in this form. More recently, in U.S. Patent No. 3,978,162 to Nakanishi, the patentees were still attempting to react polyolefins at higher proportions in a suspension polymerization process much like in the just described Barkhuff patent. Severi et al. in U.S. 4,001,349 teach grafting styrene onto an ethylene, propylene, diene modified polymer EPDM in a process carried out in aqueous phase for at least part of the reaction. However, the patentees disclose dissolving the EPDM in the styrene monomer and reacting at higher temperatures at the beginning of the process. Likewise, Founier et al U.S. 4,166,081 and Hardt et al U.S. 4,276,391 and 4,054,613 teach preparation of polyolefin graft copolymers in solution at higher temperatures and then recovering the products from the solvent. Lee in U.S. 4,098,734 teaches making graft polymer by dissolving a polybutadiene in monomers than carrying out a reaction in the usual way, eg, suspension, emulsion, bulk or combinations. He teaches that some polybutadiene crosslinks can be used but points out that this may interfere with the required dissolving of the polybutadiene. Beati et al at J. Applied Polymer Science, Vol. 26, 2185 2195 1981 disclose reacting methyl methacrylate to an EPR or EPDM rubber in a process in which the EPDM is dissolved. Thereafter the mixture is suspended, the solvent is removed and the monomer is added to form the polymer. FR A 1 445 405 teaches a process to convert low density polyethylene into a very fine dispersion in vinyl chloride by heating to a high temperature under agitation and then cooling to form a dispersion of polyethylene in vinyl chloride where the particles have sizes in the 10 200 µm range col. 4, line 73 , more preferably 10 50 µm, and have large surface area. It is not clear whether a uniform graft polymer is made, or whether only a surface reaction occurs. But the patent clearly does not teach that grafting can occur within a large particle, as in the present invention. EP A 0 007 167 refers to a method of making plastics material incorporating reclaimed tyre rubber, which comprises the steps of swelling reclaimed tyre rubber with the quantity of monomer which is insufficient to saturate the reclaimed tyre rubber and polymerizing the swollen mass. FR A 2 097 432 and FR A 2 149 239 refer to a process for preparing grafted polymers of vinyl chloride in which vinyl chloride is polymerized or copolymerized in the presence of solid ethylene backbone polymer this process requires the use of a partial pressure of vinyl chloride which is lower at all times during the polymerization than the satured vapour pressure of vinyl chloride at the temperature of polymerization. BE A 649 328 discloses a process for preparing vinyl chloride graft polymers, which comprises dissolving the solid backbone polymer in the vinyl chloride monomer. Fisher et al. J. Pol. Sci. Pol. Sym. Thus, the prior art teaches making graft copolymers at high proportions of polyolefin but requires that the polyolefin be dissolved in a monomer and the mixture then either be suspended, emulsified or that a solution process take place at a high temperature to give the product. Other art teaches reaction on the surface of particles. The idea of absorption of monomer and initiator into particles which are not soluble in the monomer followed by reaction of the monomer in the particles to give polymer and graft copolymer, which is the subject of this invention, has not be disclosed previously. The process of the present invention enables the reaction of higher proportions of olefin polymers with ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable monomers to produce highly desirable graft polymers in particulate form. The process can be carried out without the need for a solvent or a carrier medium. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, an ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable monomer is reacted with the polymer of an olefin of 2 to about 8 carbon atoms in a process wherein the olefin polymer is substantially insoluble in the monomer but is capable of absorbing the monomer. The process is truly remarkable in that solid particles of the olefin polymer are contacted with the monomer in liquid phase, the monomer is absorbed into the polymer particles and the polymerization occurs in the presence of an initiator for the reaction within the solid particles which are transformed into particles of reaction product. In another aspect of the invention, a vinyl halide polyolefin graft polymer is produced by reacting a solid polyolefin particle comprising a polymer of an olefin of 2 to about 8 carbon atoms, preferably a polyolefin of an aliphatic hydrocarbon olefin of 2 to about 8 carbon atoms with a vinyl halide monomer either alone or in combination with up to 50 percent by weight based on the total weight of monomer of an ethylenically unsaturated compound copolymerizable therewith. In this process, the olefin polymer is substantially insoluble in the monomer, but is capable of absorbing the monomer. Subject matter of the invention is therefore a graft polymer of an ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable monomer and a polymer of an olefin of 2 to 8 carbon atoms, wherein the olefin polymer is substantially insoluble in the monomer, but is capable of absorbing the monomer and which is obtained by reacting the monomer of absorbed in the liquid state by the polymer with the polymer in the presence of an initiator for the reaction. Preferred embodiments of these subjects are stated in claims 2 to claim 25 and or claims 27 to 53. A further subject is a vinyl chloride polyolefine graft polymer according to claim 54. Preferred embodiments of this subject are stated in claims 55 to 57. Subject matter of the invention is also a process for preparing a graft polymer according to claim 58 or claim 64. Preferred embodiments of these processes are subject of claims 59 to 63 and or claims 65 to 79. The process of the invention is particularly useful for reacting polyolefins in a proportion of 20 to 80 weight percent based on the weight of the reactive monomer, although higher and lower proportions can be used. The preferred proportion is 30 to 50 weight percent of polyolefin based on the weight of the reactive monomer. The products of the invention are advantageously prepared in a mass polymerization, but can also be prepared in the presence of an inert diluent, such as water. In still another aspect of the invention, the solid particles of polyolefin are contacted with liquid monomer in stages, rather than contacting all of the solid polyolefin with all of the liquid monomer in one step. It has been surprisingly found that when the stagewise reaction of liquid monomer for the solid polyolefin is continued until the proportion of the polyolefin in said polymer is 2 to 20 weight percent, preferably about 5 to about 10 weight percent based on the weight of the monomer, the resulting product can be molded to form transparent or translucent molded articles. In still another aspect of the invention, a small proportion of solid polyolefin, in the range of 0.1 to 5 weight percent based on the weight of monomer is employed in the polymerization process so that both the graft polymer and a polymer of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer are produced simultaneously in the same reactor. The solid polyolefin particles are transformed into graft polymer. The polymer of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer forms as a finely divided powder which can be readily separated from the particles of the graft polymer to provide two distinct products from one reaction vessel. A further subject matter of the invention is therefore a process for preparing a transparent polyolefin graft copolymer which comprises A further subject of the present invention is a process for concurrently producing a polyolefin graft copolymer and a polymer of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer which comprises Preferred embodiments of these processes are subject of claims 81 to 83 and or 85 to 89. The processes of the invention have many advantages over the prior art The products of the invention have many advantages including In the broad aspect of the invention, the novel graft polymers of the invention is prepared from one or more ethylenically unsaturated compounds that is polymerizable in the presence of a free radical initiator. Suitable ethylenically unsaturated compounds which can be used are illustrated by the following compounds. Monoolefinic hydrocarbons, i.e., monomers containing only carbon and hydrogen, including such materials as ethylene, propylene, 3 methylbutene 1, 4 methylpentene 1, pentene 1, 3,3 dimentylbutene 1, 4,4 dimethylbutene 1, octene 1, decene 1, styrene and its nuclear, alpha alkyl or aryl substituted derivatives, e.g., o , m or p methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl styrene, alpha methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl styrene phenyl styrene, and halogenated styrenes such as alphachlorostyrene monoolefinically unsaturated esters including vinyl esters, e.g., vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrate, vinyl stearate, vinyl benzoate, vinyl p chlorobenzoates, alkyl methacrylates, e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, octyl and lauryl methacrylate alkyl crotonates, e.g., octyl alkyl acrylates, e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, 2 ethylhexyl, stearyl, hydroxyethyl and tertiary butylamino acrylates, isopropenyl esters, e.g., isopropenyl acetate, isopropenyl propionate, isopropenyl butyrate and isopropenyl isobutyrate isopropenyl halides, e.g., isopropenyl chloride vinyl esters of halogenated acids, e.g., vinyl alpha chloroacetate, vinyl alpha chloropropionate and vinyl alpha bromopropionate allyl and methallyl compounds, e.g., allyl chloride, allyl alcohol, allyl cyanide, allyl chlorocarbonate, allyl nitrate, allyl formate and allyl acetate and the corresponding methallyl compounds esters of alkenyl alcohols, e.g., beta ethyl allyl alcohol and beta propyl allyl alcohol haloalkyl acrylates, e.g., methyl alpha chloroacrylate, ethyl alpha chloroacrylate, methyl alphabromoacrylate, ethyl alphabromoacylated, methyl alpha fluoroacrylate, ethyl alpha fluoroacrylate, methyl alpha iodoacrylate and ethyl alpha iodoacrylate alkyl alpha cyanoacrylates, e.g., methyl alpha cyanoacrylate and ethyl alpha cyanoacrylate and maleates, e.g., monomethyl maleate, monoethyl maleate, dimethyl maleate, diethyl maleate and fumarates, e.g., monomethyl fumarate, monoethyl fumarate, dimethyl fumarate, diethyl fumarate and diethyl glutaconate monoolefinically unsaturated organic nitriles including, for example, fumaronitrile, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, ethacrylonitrile, 1,1 dicyanopropene 1, 3 octenonitrile, crotononitrile and oleonitrile monoolefinically unsaturated carboxylic acids including, for example, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, 3 butenoic acid, cinnamic acid, maleic, fumaric and itaconic acids, maleic anhydride and the like. Amides of these acids, such as acrylamide, are also useful. Vinyl alkyl ethers and vinyl ethers, e.g., vinyl methyl ether, vinyl ethyl ether, vinyl propyl ether, vinyl n butyl ether, vinyl isobutyl ether, vinyl 2 ethylhexyl ether, vinyl 2 chloroethyl ether, vinyl propyl ether, vinyl n butyl ether, vinyl isobutyl ether, vinyl 2 ethylhexyl ether, vinyl 2 chloroethyl ether, vinyl cetyl ether and the like and vinyl sulfides, e.g., vinyl betachloroethyl sulfide, vinyl beta ethoxyethyl sulfide and the like can also be included as can diolefinically unsaturated hydrocarbons containing two olefinic groups in conjugated relation and the halogen derivatives thereof, e.g., butadiene 1,3 2 methylbutadiene 1,3 2,3 dimethylbutadiene 1,3 2 methylbutadiene 1,3 2,3 dimethylbutadiene 1,3 2 chlorobutadiene 1,3 2,3 dichloro butadiene 1,3 and 2 bromo butadiene 1,3 and the like. Mixtures of the foregoing compounds can also be employed. Particularly useful monomer compositions include styrene, methyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, vinyl acetate, mixtures of styrene and acrylonitrile, and mixtures of styrene and various maleates. In one aspect of the invention, the preferred monomer composition is comprised totally of a vinyl halide monomer. Suitable vinyl halide monomers useful in the invention are the halo substituted ethylenically unsaturated compounds which are capable of entering into an addition polymerization reaction, for example vinyl monohalides such as vinyl fluoride, vinyl chloride, vinyl bromide, and vinyl iodide, as well as vinyl dihalides such as vinylidene fluoride, vinylidene chloride, vinylidene bromide, and vinylidene iodide and the like. Higher halo substituted compounds can also be used. Vinyl chloride is preferred. While it is preferred that the monomer composition be comprised totally of vinyl halide monomer as described above, the present invention is also intended to include copolymers formed by the free radical addition polymerization of a monomer composition containing a predominant amount, e.g., at least 50 percent of vinyl halide with the remainder being another ethylenically unsaturated monomer composition copolymerizable therewith. Preferably, the other ethylenically unsaturated monomer is used in amounts of 20 percent or less by weight and more preferably in amounts of 10 percent or less by weight of the total monomer used in preparing the polymer. Specific monomer compositions for forming copolymers can be illustrated by vinyl chloride and or vinylidene chloride and vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride and or vinylidene chloride and maleic or fumaric acid esters, vinyl chloride and or vinylidene chloride and acrylate or methacrylate ester, vinyl chloride and or vinylidene chloride and vinyl alkyl ether. These are given as illustrative of the numerous combinations of monomers possible for the formation of copolymers. The present invention includes all such combinations. The polyolefin component of the invention is characterized by being substantially insoluble in the reactive monomer component, and it remains insoluble during the polymerization reaction. The polyolefin is also capable of absorbing the reactive monomer component. For most polyolefin monomer combinations, when the proportion of polyolefin in the reaction mixture is at least about 20 weight percent of the reactive components, essentially all of the monomer component is absorbed into the particles of polyolefin component where the reaction occurs. Generally, the polyolefin is capable of absorbing monomer to the extent of at least about 10 weight percent of the weight of polyolefin, usually at least about 25 weight percent and more usually at least about 100 weight percent of the weight of polyolefin. Generally, the polyolefin can absorb monomer up to 10 times the weight of polyolefin, more usually up to about 400 weight percent and still more usually up to 300 weight percent of the weight of polyolefin. The polyolefin may swell in the presence of the monomer. But the polyolefin remains as a free flowing particle that does not agglomerate or fuse. The preferred polyolefins are prepared from unsubstituted, aliphatic hydrocarbon monoolefins, including straight chain and branched chain compounds such as ethylene, propylene and butene 1, isobutene, pentene, hexene, heptene, octene, isobutene, 3 methylbutene 1, 4 methylpentene 1, 4 methylhexene 1, and 5 methylhexene 1. The polyolefin also preferably contains an unsubstituted, aliphatic hydrocarbon polyene, such as diene or triene, as a monomer unit. Such unsubstituted compounds can be straight chain, branched chain or cyclic compounds. Generally polyenes of from 5 to 18 carbon atoms are employed. Suitable comonomers for preparing the polyolefins are those utilized to prepare homopolymers as listed above such as propene or butene 1 with ethylene or isobutylene with isoprene and the like. Suitable termonomers are those utilized to prepare homopolymers and copolymers as disclosed above such as propene, ethylene and the like containing up to 15 percent, preferably up to about 10 percent by weight of polyene, for example, a diene such as dicyclopentadiene, 1,3 butadiene, 1,5 cyclooctadiene, 2 ethylidenenorbornene 5, 1,4 hexadiene, 1,4 heptadiene, bicyclo 2.2.1 hepta 2,5 diene and other conjugated and especially nonconjugated dienes with linear or cyclic chains. Trienes such as isopropylidene cyclopentadiene and the Diels Alder mono and di adducts thereof with cyclopentadiene can be used in place of the diene. Unsubstituted, aliphatic diolefins can also be used for preparing useful polyolefins such as butadiene, isoprene, octadiene, and the like. Especially useful are the various forms of polybutadiene, such as made in emulsion, suspension or solution processes, and random, block, and star block polymers with monomer such as styrene. Various other polyolefins that contain other than hydrogen and carbon can also be employed as long as they meet the criteria of being insoluble in the reactive monomer and capable of absorbing that monomer. Such polyolefins are generally polymers of substituted, aliphatic hydrocarbon olefins of 2 to 8 carbon atoms, and are more particularly polymers of an unsubstituted, aliphatic hydrocarbon olefin of 2 to 8 carbon atoms and a substituted, aliphatic hydrocarbon olefin of 2 to 8 carbon atoms. Suitable substituted hydrocarbon olefins include vinyl acetate, vinyl benzoate, and other vinyl esters with organic acids and haloacids, isopropenyl acetate and other esters, methyl methacrylate and other alkylmethacrylates, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate and other alkyl acrylates, and olefins. Included in such additional polyolefins are olefin vinyl acetate copolymers, such as ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers olefin acrylate copolymers, such as ethylene acrylate copolymers polychlorobutadiene, and the like. Suitable polyolefin components include the above described homopolymers, copolymers or terpolymers, but can also include blends of two or more polyolefins that may not meet the criteria in themselves, but the blended composition is insoluble in the reactive monomer but capable of absorbing the reactive monomer. Thus, certain ethylene propylene diene modified polymers EPDM are soluble in vinyl chloride monomer, and hence are not suitable when used alone in the process of the invention. High density polyethylene HDPE is insoluble in vinyl chloride monomer, but does not absorb that monomer, and hence is not suitable when used alone in the process of the invention. However, it is found that mixtures of ethylene propylene diene modified polymers and high density polyethylene when melt blended are highly desirable in the process of the invention. The higher the ethylene content of the EPDM, the lower the amount of HDPE required. Particularly suitable are HDPE s having a melt index of 01 to 50, blended with a polyolefin, for example, EPDM at a ratio of from 1 to 20 to 20 to 1. Low density polyethylene is found to be both insoluble in vinyl chloride monomer and capable of absorbing that monomer, and is useful in the process of the invention. The very low density polyethylene waxes, on the other hand, are soluble in vinyl chloride monomer and hence are not suitable when used alone in the process of the invention. Other useful blends of polyolefins include blends of polybutadiene and high density polyethylene. Very high molecular weight polymers, e.g. polybutadiene of weight average molecular weight of over 1,000,000, or ethylene propylene copolymer of weight average molecular weight over 300,000, function in this manner without blending in reactions where their lower homologs may need to be blended to meet the nonsolubility requirement. It is to be understood that a given blend or polymer may be substantially insoluble in certain monomers but is soluble or partially soluble in other monomers. Where partial solubility is involved, suitability of the polymer or blend and monomer combination for the purposes of the present invention depends on whether the graft polymer produced is in substantial particulate form. The polyoelfin used in the invention is in particulate form. The particles may be pellets, such as formed by extrusion through an orifice and cutting into pellets by a dicer. The particles can also be formed as pellets in a pellet forming device. The polyolefin is generally in the form of particles measuring in the range of about 1 to about 5 millimeters, preferably about 1 to about 3 millimeters. Other particle sizes can be used. The particles can be of various shapes, such as beads and cylinders, pill shaped, as well as in irregular shapes resulting from grinding. The products of the invention are prepared in a mass polymerization process wherein solid discrete particles or pellets of solid polyolefin are mixed with a monomer component in the liquid state and a free radical initiator compound at ambient temperatures. All or part of the mixture of monomer and initiator compound is absorbed into the solid polyolefin particles. It is preferred to put all the monomer into the reactor with the polyolefin at the beginning of the reaction. However, the monomer can be added incrementally during the reaction. As indicated hereinbefore, the monomer can be reacted with the polyolefin in steps to achieve the desired product. Generally only sufficient monomer is introduced at one time to the polyolefin to avoid the formation of powdered polymer, except, of course, in the aspect of the invention where co manufacture of particles of graft polymer and powdered homopolymer or copolymer is desired. When operating in the stepwise embodiment, the amount of monomer added in the second and subsequent steps does not usually exceed the ratio of monomer to polyolefin established in the first step of the sequence. The reaction mixture is heated to a temperature in the range of 30 to 90 degrees Celsius, preferably in the range of about 40 to about 75 degrees Celsius, more preferably in the range of about 60 to about 70 degrees Celsius, and the reaction is allowed to proceed to the desired conversion of monomer, generally in the range of about 30 to 90 percent conversion, preferably about 50 to 80 percent conversion, and more preferably about 60 to 75 percent conversion. Thereafter, the unreacted monomer component is removed from the reaction mixture by suitable degassing techniques such as by direct degassing, by drawing a vacuum on the reaction product, by washing with water or a solvent or by steam distillation. The solid reaction product is withdrawn from the reaction vessel as the product of the process. Suitable initiator compounds for use in the process of the invention include organic or inorganic peroxides, persulfates, ozonides, hydroperoxides, peracids and percarbonates, azo compounds, diazonium salts, diazotates, peroxysulfonates, trialkyl borane oxygen systems, and amine oxides. Suitable initiators are soluble in the organic phase, such as peroxides benzoyl peroxide, capryl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, 2,4 dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, diacetyl peroxide, and acetyl cyclohexylsulfonyl peroxide azo compounds azobisisobutyronitrile, azobis alphamethyl gammacarboxybutyronitrile peroxydicarbonates diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, di sec butyl peroxydicarbonate, and dicyclohexylperoxydicarbonate, azobisisobutyramidine hydrochloride, and peresters t butyl peroxypivalate and t butyl peroxyneodecanoate. Peroxydicarbonates, peresters and peroxides are particularly useful in the present invention. The initiator is used in concentration ranging from about 0.01 to about one percent by weight, preferably about 0.1 to about 0.5 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the monomers. Amounts of initiator sufficient to initiate the reaction should be used. The best amount may vary depending on reaction temperature, nature of the polyolefin or allowed reaction time. Various diluents may be used in the process of the invention. Preferably, the diluents employed should be substantially non reactive with the products of the invention and do not dissolve the products of the invention. The most common diluent is water, which may be used without any suspending or emulsifying agent. Essentially, when water is used as the diluent, the particles of solid polyolefin float in the water phase and during the reaction process are dispersed through the water phase by suitable agitation. Other diluents include organic compounds such as saturated hydrocarbons having from about 3 to about 15 carbon atoms per molecule. Preferably, the diluent is a straight or branched chain, or cyclic saturated hydrocarbon having from 3 to 15 carbon atoms, and more preferably, from 4 to 8 carbon atoms. Alcohols of 1 to 15 carbon atoms can also be employed. Illustrative examples of suitable diluents which can be employed in the present process include n propane, n butane, isobutane, isopentane, neopentane, 2 methylpentane, 3 methylpentane, 2,2,4 trimethylpentane, 2,2,3 trimethylpentane, n tridecane and n pentadecane. Mixtures of these and other hydrocarbon alkanes, as well as cycloalkanes, such as cyclohexane and methyl cyclopropane, can be used also. Useful alcohols include ethyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, octyl and dodecyl alcohols, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,3 dihydroxypropane, and the like. The diluents can enter the polyolefin particle as in the case of hydrocarbons, or may stay out as in the case of water, or both. When water is used as the diluent, the proportion may range from about 10 to about 1000 percent by weight based on the organic phase polyolefin plus monomers , more preferably from about 100 to 400 percent by weight. If an alcohol, hydrocarbon or other diluent is used, the proportion can be from about 0.1 to 100 percent by weight based on the polyolefin plus monomer, more preferably between 1 to 5 percent by weight. Chain transfer agents can be used in the process of the invention. One purpose of such chain transfer agents is to adjust the molecular weight of the polymerized monomer starring material. The polyolefin component itself is found to serve as a chain transfer agent by changing the molecular weight of the PVC produced in the case of vinyl chloride monomer. Other transfer agents that can be used include aldehydes, mercaptans such as mercaptoethanol, dodecylmercaptan chloroolefins such as perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, halomethanes such as bromoform, olefins, substituted isopropyl compounds, thiotin compounds, such as alkyltin mercaptoacetate esters and the like. When a chain transfer agent is used, the proportion is generally in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 percent by weight, preferably from about 0.5 to about 2 percent by weight. The products of the invention are preferably stabilized against the adverse effects of heat, light and other environmental factors by introducing suitable stabilizers at the end of the polymerization reaction, but prior to the venting or degassing step to remove unreacted monomer, as well as, in subsequent compounds of the product with other additives. Surprisingly, the stabilizer can also be introduced at the beginning of the reaction. All or a combination of these stabilization techniques can be employed. The polymer product of the invention has the advantage that it can absorb monomers, solvents and other liquid additives. This feature can be relied on to facilitate stabilization of the product. Prior to the degassing step to remove monomer, which step often discolors the product because of heat, a stabilizer can be added to the polymer particles. The stabilizer compound is absorbed into the particle to protect the polymer during degassing. In practice, the stabilizer can be mixed with monomer compound and then introduced to the reactor and mixed with the polyolefin particles. Another suitable liquid, such as an alcohol, can also be added with the monomer to facilitate absorption of the stabilizer into the monomer. Heating also helps to drive the stabilizer into the pellets. The stabilizer, monomer and other liquid, are absorbed into the polyolefin particles. Thereafter the monomer and other liquid are removed, such as, by heating, application of vacuum, steam distillation, and the like, leaving the stabilizer in the particles to protect the polymer. Suitable stabilizers include salts of polyvalent metals such as cadmium, manganese, cerium, strontium, calcium, tin, barium, magnesium and lead and alkanoic monocarboxylic acids of 6 to 20 carbon atoms. Typical salts include the stearates, laurates, caproates, undecylates of the foregoing metals. Also used are amine stabilizers such as diphenyl amine, thiourea, aryl thiourea and the like. Also known as useful stabilizers are the alkyl esters of organotinmercaptide substituted alkanoic acids. The alkyl group in the ester part of the molecule may be methyl, n butyl, ethyl, hexyl, isooctyl or other group. The organo groups on the tin atom may include methyl, butyl or octyl, while examples of the base alkanoic acids are acetic or butyric. Esters of dibutyl tin bis iso octyl mercaptoacetic acid are particularly effective in this regard. Also useful in this connection are di and tri alkyl tin derivatives of C₂ C₁₈ alkanoic acids such as di n butyl tin diacetate and tri n octyl tin laurate. An especially good result is obtained using a mixture of the dioctyl tin stabilizers, namely a mixture of di n octyl tin mercaptide of mercapto acetic acid, iso octyl ester and tri n octyl tin laurate. The dialkyltin maleates are useful stabilizers. They are more effective when dissolved or mixed with an alcohol, such as ethanol or other alcohol having up to 18 carbon atoms. The dialkytin maleates with alcohol can be advantageously added at the start of the reaction without adverse effects on the reaction and yet providing the desired stabilization effects on the polymer product. Other suitable stabilizers include various phosphite esters. These can include alkylphenyl phosphites such as nonylphenyl phosphite or 4,4 isopropylidene diphenol, alkyl phosphite esters where the alkyl group contains 12 15 carbon atoms. The stabilizers are employed in a proportion of about 0.01 to about 1 percent by weight, preferably about 0.05 to about 0.5 percent by weight, more preferably, about 0.1 to about 0.5 percent by weight, based on the weight of polymer. The most preferred range for the dialkyltin maleate with alcohol is about 0.05 to about 0.12 weight percent. If the product is not stabilized or if a poor stabilizer is used and the product pellets come out highly colored due to decomposition during the high temperature degassing step where the PVC portion of the product decomposes into colored polyene units, it is possible to reverse this reaction in a post treatment using a small amount of monomer or monomer mixtures and free radical initiator that will react with the polyene units. An inert fluid medium may assist in transporting the monomer into the particles. Monomers listed under monomer components may be used where methyl methacrylate and styrene are particularly effective in this regard. Initiators listed hereinabove may be used. Any liquid that will dissolve the monomer and initiator and which will be absorbed by the solid product may be employed in this process. Hydrocarbons are particularly useful in this regard. The reaction proceeds effectively at 65 C although with proper choice of components may be carried out between 30 and 90 C. In the polymerization reactions of the invention, a portion of the polyolefin is grafted with a portion of the unsaturated monomer to form a grafted polymer component. The product contains polyolefin and may contain some homopolymer or copolymer component resulting from polymerization of some of the unsaturated monomer or monomers. The proportions of the various components vary depending on reaction conditions. Chart A shows a typical range of proportions of the various components of the products of this invention. The polymers of this invention can be formed into useful articles such as bottles, sheeting, wire and cable coatings, films, membranes, pipe, fittings, appliance housings, roofing membranes, and the like where such properties as impact room temperature or lower heat distortion, tensile or flexural strength, fire retardance, clarity, oil resistance, long term retention of properties, etc. may be obtained depending on the exact nature of the monomer and polymers. The polymers can be compounded with or processed with such things as fillers mineral, inorganic or organic plasticizers, process aids, stabilizers, lubricants, coloring agents, such as organic or inorganic pigments, and the like. The products may be further reacted with other monomers to make a thermosetting product or may be crosslinked, vulcanized or further reacted in other ways. A more detailed description of suitable stabilizers, lubricants and processing aids for incorporation into the compositions of the invention is presented in US Patent 4,319,002. Additional classes of additives known for use in polyvinyl halide resins which can be added optionally to the compositions of the invention in addition to the aforementioned stabilizers, lubricants and processing aids include pigments, dyes and fillers as described in L. R. Brecker, In general, the amount of each type of the aforementioned optional additive employed in the present composition is about 0.01 to about 5 weight percent, preferably about 0.1 to about 3 weight percent, based on the total resin composition. The graft polymers of the invention can be blended with polymers and copolymers, polymerized from the same unsaturated monomer or monomers used in preparing the graft polymers of the invention. Thus, graft polymers of a vinyl halide and a polyolefin can be blended with various preparations of a polyvinyl halide to provide a family of polymer products having utilities such as listed for the base graft polymer. An especially useful composition includes an EPDM PVC graft polymer blended with PVC homopolymer which has been molded or extruded into useful objects having improved impact properties with good retention of these properties. Another useful composition includes the above described blend which additionally includes chlorinated PVC to give an impact polymer with improved heat distortion temperature. Other useful blends include those obtained by grafting to EPDM, polybutadiene PBD , ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer or styrene butadiene block copolymer, such monomers or mixtures of monomers as vinyl chloride, styrene with acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate, styrene, acrylonitrile, styrene with butyl maleate, styrene with maleic anhydride, cyclohexylacrylate, styrene with methyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, methyl acrylate with styrene and lauryl methacrylate, and blending such graft polymers with the respective polymers or copolymers of the listed monomers or comonomers. The graft polymer of the invention can be blended with various other polymers of provide products with different properties than the base graft polymer. Such other polymers include glassy, crystalline polymers, rubbery polymers and mixtures thereof as exemplified by ABS polymers. Examples of such polymers include polyvinyl chloride, styrene acrylonitrile copolymers SAN , polymethylmethacrylate PMMA , chlorinated polyvinyl chloride CPVC , graft copolymers of acrylonitrile and styrene on polybutadiene or a blend of acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer with styrene acrylonitrile copolymer ABS , polyolefins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, polystyrenes, poly α methylstyrene, ABS polycarbonate alloys, acetal polymers, cellulosic polymers, fluoropolymers, ionomers, nylons, polyphenylene oxide polymers, polysulfones, polyether sulfones, polyallomer, poly ethylene vinyl acetate , poly ethylene ethyl acrylate , polymethyl pentene, polyphenylene sulfide, thermoplastic elastomers, alkyl resins, epoxy resins, silicone polymers, urethane polymers, and the like, and any two or more of the foregoing polymers. Particularly useful blends include those obtained by grafting to EPDM, polybutadiene, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer or styrene butadiene block copolymers, such monomers or mixtures of monomers as vinyl chloride, methyl methacrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate and styrene with methyl methacrylate, and blending such graft polymers with polymers such as polyvinyl chloride, styrene acrylonitrile copolymers, polystyrene and acetal polymers. Blends of the graft polymers of the invention with the just described other polymers and with the previously described polymers and copolymers polymerized with the same monomer or monomers used in preparing the graft polymers, are also contemplated. Typical of these blends include the graft polymer, polyvinyl chloride and a third polymer such as polystyrenes, styrene acrylonitrile copolymers, ethylene, propylene polyene modified polymers, polyethylene, chlorinated polyvinyl chloride, and a graft copolymer of styrene and acrylonitrile on polybutadiene or a blend of acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer and styrene acrylonitrile copolymers both forms of ABS polymers , and the like. In some of the foregoing blends, the graft polymers of the invention are useful for compatibilizing otherwise non compatible polymers such as polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene. The graft polymer can have end groups or parts similar to one or the other of the two materials. Especially useful blends of the products of the invention include 1 blends with polymers of acrylonitrile and styrene with polymers such as chlorinated polyethylene, acrylic rubber and ethylene propylene diene polymers, such as disclosed in US Patent 4537933 2 blends with styrene maleic anhydride copolymers such as disclosed in US Patent 4562229 and 3 blends with condensation polymers such as polycarbonates and polyesters, such as disclosed in US Patent 4587297. Proportions of the polyolefin graft polymer in binary blends with any other polymer can range typically from less than about 1 percent to more than about 99 weight percent of graft polymer with the balance being the other polymer component . It is preferred to provide blends which contain about 5 percent up to about 80 percent of the polyolefin graft polymer to achieve the desired enhanced properties. Preferred blends of this aspect of the invention contain about from about 10 percent to about 60 percent of the graft polymer component and from about 40 percent to about 90 percent of the other polymer component, said percentages being based on the weight of the blend of the graft polymer and the other polymer. With respect to the aspect of the invention involving not only the graft polymer component and a second polymer component, but also an auxiliary polymer comprising a polymer or copolymer, the proportions of components are in the following ranges. The second polymer component is generally present in a proportion of about 20 percent to about 80 percent of the total polymer components, with the remainder being the polyolefin graft copolymer and the auxiliary polymer component. The latter two components are generally present in the proportion of about 10 parts polyolein graft polymer to 90 parts auxiliary polymer to about 90 parts polyolefin graft polymer to 10 parts auxiliary polymer. The range is preferably from about 20 parts polyolefin graft polymer to 80 parts auxiliary polymer to 40 parts auxiliary polymer to about 30 parts polyolefin graft polymer to 60 parts auxiliary polymer. All parts and percentages are by weight. The following examples are intended to illustrate but not limit the invention. Unless indicated otherwise in this specification and claims, parts, ratios and proportions are by weight, and temperatures are in degrees Celsius. Into a one liter glass autoclave equipped with a heating jacket and stirrer with helical elements, were charged 75 grams of a commercially pelletized blend of polyolefins containing approximately 85 weight percent of an EPDM elastomer having a molar ratio of ethylene to propylene of about 72 percent to 28 percent, and 3 double bonds of unsaturation as 1,4 hexadiene per 1,000 carbon to carbon bonds db 1,000 C C of approximately 170,000 weight average molecular weight with about 15 weight percent high density polyethylene. The particle size of the pelletized blend was about 3 mm in diameter by 1.5 mm in thickness. The vessel was pressurized to 1.24 MPa 180 psig with nitrogen and the pressure was released. A solution of 0.5 ml of a 75 solution of the t butyl peroxide neodecanoate in mineral spirits free radical initiator and about 305 grams vinyl chloride was added. About 5 grams of the vinyl chloride was vented from the reactor to purge volatile gasses to give a net charge of vinyl chloride of 300 grams. The mixture was heated with circulating water at 60 and was stirred at a rate of 100 rpm. Initially the mixture consisted of pellets floating on top of liquid monomer at 0.275 MPa 40 psig , and the total filled the reactor to the 500 ml mark. On heating and stirring, the liquid vinyl chloride phase gradually disappeared and the pellets became swollen. After 40 minutes of heating and stirring the liquid phase ceased to exist. The only liquid was that which refluxed from the unheated top of the reactor. The reactor now at 0.744 MPa 108 psig contained loose white swollen pellets to the 600 ml mark. The mass remained as swollen white pellets with traces of powder. The volume of the mixture gradually increased until a maximum of 800 ml was reached at 1.2 hour after start of heating. A maximum pressure of 1.136 MPa 165 psig was reached at 1.3 hour after start of heating. AT this point, the temperature of the heating medium was dropped to 57 C and held there for 20 minutes and then returned to 60 C. By this time now 1.7 hour after start of heating , the pressure was 145 psig and the pellets were starting to dry . There were traces of liquid still refluxing from the top of the reactor. After another 50 minutes, the pressure had fallen to 0.654 MPa 95 psig , the volume of loose stirring pellets decreased to 700 ml. and the reaction was terminated by venting unreacted monomer to a recovery system. The product contained 322 grams of material. Thirty grams of this was as agglomerated pellets in the lower corners of the reactor while the rest or 292 grams consisted of white free flowing pellets 91 of the total product about 2 3 times the size of the starting pellet material. The polyolefin content of the final product was calculated by the following equation 75 grams polyolefin 322 total product 100 23 total polyolefin. The vinyl chloride conversion to polymer is given by equation The polyolefin PVC product mixture was separated into its individual components taking advantage of the solvent nonsolvent properties of the solvents listed in Table 1 for the individual components in the mixture. A method to approximately determine such compositions consists of heating about 5 grams accurately weighed of pellets with 200 ml perchloroethylene in a steam bath over night, decanting the solvent from the swollen floating pellets with a large syringe, then repeating with another portion of perchloroethylene and heating another 3 4 hr. at 100 C and again decanting. The combined perchloroethylene extract is freed of solvent on a rotary evaporator. This predominantly polyolefin fraction is extracted with dimethylformamide to remove traces of PVC homopolymer, freed of residual dimethylformamide, then extracted with a hot branched hydrocarbon mixture with cooling to room temperature before decanting. Concentration of this hydrocarbon extract gives predominantly the unreacted EPDM part of the polyolefin. The insoluble fraction is a mixture of ungrafted high density polyethylene, with some polyolefin grafted with PVC. It is possible to estimate the amounts of the two from chlorine analysis, infrared spectrum analysis or in part by calculation. However, this generally has not been done. Thus, the amount of polyolefin in the grafted from was calculated in the form of a range depending on the amount of material in the hydrocarbon insoluble fraction given by the difference between Equations 3 and 4. This range is reported and used or a more specific number is used if additional data is available for a particular sample. The pellets after perchloroethylene treatment are freed of residual perchloroethylene and then extracted with dimethyl formamide two times by heating 1 2 hours at 100 , to give free ungrafted PVC as the soluble fraction either discarded or may be precipitated by methanol or water if further studies are desired . The residual insoluble fraction is freed of solvent to yield polyolefin PVC graft copolymer. For the product of Example 1 the assay numbers of interest are Polyolefin PVC graft polymer 37 In like manner, several other reactions were carried out following the general procedure outlined above. Only the ratio of polyolefin to vinyl chloride to free radical initiator or other parameter was changed. These are listed in Table 2. Example 2 illustrates that at a high vinyl chloride to polyolefin ratio, powder was formed in addition to the pelletized product. Most of the polyolefin remained in the pellet and very little was found in the powder. In Example 3, the weight ratio of vinyl chloride to polyolefin was 6 to 1. Some powder was also formed. In Example 4, the vinyl chloride to polyolefin ratio if 4 to 1. At this ratio only pellets were formed with no powder. Examples 5 8 illustrate lower vinyl chloride to polyolefin ratios which give compositions with higher polyolefin contents. In Example 9, too little free radical initiator was added to convert the vinyl chloride to a high degree. The polyolefin is not as highly grafted as in Examples 1 8. However, if the recovered product from Example 9 is reacted as shown in Example 10, it is possible to restart or continue the reaction and to make highly grafted product. It is possible to further react any other product to give lower level polyolefin containing products. Reference to Example 10 means a product prepared in two or more steps. Reference to other Examples in Table 2 means that the general conditions of Example 1 were followed using the ratio of reactants given by the particular example in Table 2. In the reactor described in Example 1, equipped with a turbine type agitator, were charged 50 grams of the polyolefin of Example 1 and 400 ml water. The vessel was pressure tested and vented. Initiator 0.2 ml of 60 percent sec butyl peroxydicarbonate in mineral spirits and vinyl chloride 150 grams were charged. The stirrer was operated at 500 rpm and the jacket was heated to 60 C. Initially the vinyl chloride floated on the water and the pellets floated on the vinyl chloride. The vinyl chloride was rapidly absorbed into the pellets and the swollen pellets floated on top of and were mixed into the moving water. The pellets quickly floated on top of the water if the stirrer was turned off. The pressure of the system increased to a maximum of 0.72 MPa 104 psig at 2 hours into the heating cycle. AFter 4 hours of heating, the pressure had fallen to 0.59 MPa 86 psig , and the unreacted monomer was recovered. The pellets were isolated from the water on a screen and dried to constant weight at room temperature. The yield was 129 grams of all free flowing pellets, containing 39 polyolefin and 53 vinyl chloride conversion. Assay as in Example 1 gave 28 32 grafted polyolefin and 48 graft polymer content. Other commercial polyolefins, available as pellet, crumb, or bale were blended with a commercial high density polyethylene by milling on a Farrell Mill mill rolls at 176.6 C 350 F for 3 minutes , followed by grinding with a Wiley Mill to pass 6mm, and were evaluated as to suitability for this type of reaction. Vinyl chloride was the monomer in all cases, and the procedure and ratio of reactants of one of the above examples was employed as indicated in Table 3. The results of these examples are summarized in Table 3. Example 13A illustrates that when the polyolefin did not absorb monomer, then a graft polymer was not made. On the other hand, when the polyolefin is partially soluble in the monomer as in Examples 13F and 13H, mixtures tend to solidify or agglomerate into a single mass of material. On the other hand, the other polyolefins or polyolefin blends in Table 3 absorb monomer but remain insoluble so that useful compositions were prepared. Table 3 shows that many polyolefins can be converted to form suitable to this type of reaction. Also it is noted that polymers other than high density polyethylene can be used to convert a polyolefin to a form suitable for reaction. Any other composition or mixture that meets the criteria of absorbing monomer but not dissolving in the monomer or at least not dissolving during the time of reaction will work and is considered to be within the spirit and intent of this disclosure. Any monomer polymer combination that meets the criteria that the monomer will be absorbed into the polymer without dissolving the polymer can be used in the process of the invention. Thus, for instance, reactions of Table 4 illustrate the reaction of the polyolefin of Example 1 with other monomers. In Example 14, the monomers were largely absorbed into the pellets without dissolving them. After the reactions, the products were shaken with isopropyl alcohol to wash out any residual monomer. The products in Reactions D to H of Table 4, Part 1 weigh more than the starting polyolefin indicating that polymerization has taken place. It is important to note that the polyolefin did not dissolve together or fuse solidly into a mass. In a second series, in Example 14 Table 4 part 2 more initiator and longer reaction times were used to give products with almost all of the monomer converted to polymer. The pellets remained free flowing or in some cases some sticking was observed and the monomers polymerized in the pelletized polyolefin. In other reaction of the same reactants as in Reaction B of Example 14 Table 4, part 1 and in Reaction B of Example 14 Table 4, part 2 , using the same reactor as described in Example 1, where 100g of the polyolefin, 50ml of methylmethacrylate and 1 ml of the t butylperoxyneodecanate were heated with stirring for 6 hours, a yield of 134g of free flowing clear pellet product was obtained indicating 85 conversion of the methyl methacrylate to polymer. An extraction of a sample at 65 by shaking with dimethyl formamide, a solvent for polymethylmethacrylate homopolymer dissolved 21 of the material indicated that 25 of the polymethyl methacrylate is actually grafted to the polyolefin in the pellets. The product of Example 15A can be used directly or may be reacted in subsequent steps with other monomers to make different products. Thus, for instance, 50g of the product of Example 15A along with 0.3ml of the same initiator and 170g of vinyl chloride were reacted in the same reactor at 60 for 4 hours. After recovery of unreacted vinyl chloride, a yield of 177g of free flowing pelletized product was realized. Stepwise reactions with two monomers can be carried out in the reverse order. Thus, a product was made according to Example 5 and then at the end of reaction and degassing 0.5ml of the same initiator and 25ml methyl methacrylate were charged and the mixture heated for 2 hours at 65 followed by final degassing to yield 312g of pelletized product. The principle of the reaction is not limited to the polyolefins illustrated above. A blend of 2 parts of a commercial solution prepared polybutadiene of weight average molecular weight of 225,000 was blended with 1 part of HDPE on a mill at 171 176.6 340 350 F and ground to pass a 5mm screen. This material was reacted with other monomers according to Table 5. For all combinations in Example 16, the monomers were almost totally converted to polymers judged by isopropyl alcohol extraction shaken 1 hour, 65 , decant and dry for monomers. After freeing the samples of residual isopropyl alcohol, they were extracted with acetone by shaking in a bottle in a bath at 65 . Acetone dissolves part or all the homopolymers or copolymers involved here. Thus, the illustrated monomers are to a large degree grafted to the polyolefin. These materials themselves may be formed into useful articles or they may be used as impact modifiers for PVC, polystyrene, styrene acrylonitrile, polymethylmethacrylate or many other polymeric materials to make useful products. The reaction of other polyolefins or other related materials is illustrated by Example 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21. The starting polyolefin or other insoluble polymer capable of absorbing monomer were either of commercial nature or prepared according to Example 13. Reactions were generally carried out as in Example 16 where the solid, initiator and monomers were mixed in a 113.4 g 4 oz. bottle and shaken in a constant temperature bath at 65 for a time and the residual unreacted monomer was washed out of the polymer using isopropyl alcohol and the product dried to constant weight. In Example 17 a commercial pelletized ethylene vinyl acetate having 9 vinyl acetate was used to make products having essentially all of the starting monomer bound in the pellets which were free flowing. In Example 18, a commercial pelletized stir block copolymer having blocks of polybutadiene 70 end polystyrene 30 was reacted with a similar series of monomers. It is noted here that the monomers tend to stick the pellets together although the mixture did not solidify Into a solid mass. The yield of polymer in Examples 18 A D was in the low to medium range. However, if some isopropyl alcohol, an inert diluent, is added and the reaction time extended, the yield of product and the particle distribution are both improved. In Example 19 several monomers were reacted with a solution prepared polybutadiene blended 3 1 with HDPE for 4 hours. The monomers were absorbed into the particles keeping the polyolefin a free flowing material but the conversion of monomer to polymer was slight. The recovered polyolefin blends from several of these examples were reused in the experiments in Example 20. Here the initiator level and the reaction time were both increased to yield several free flowing graft copolymer compositions. In examples with styrene and styrene maleic anhydride, reclaimed polyolefin blend now gave high yield polymer. The reations with vinyl acetate and butyl vinyl ether still showed little conversion under these conditions. Copolymers with styrene acrylonitrile and styrene methyl methacrylate on new unreacted blend were also prepared in good yield. In Example 21, a star block copolymer similar to that used in Example 18, but having a butadiene ratio to styrene ratio of 60 40 was used. This material was more prone to dissolving in the monomers used to the extent that blending with polyethylene and adding isopropyl alcohol only gave marginal results. The star block copolymer in E and F totally dissolved into the monomers. The reactions E and F in Example 21 would have little chance of success in the process at hand owing to too great a solubility while most of those other reactions in Examples 21 and 17 to 20 illustrate the point of the monomer going into the solid phase and polymerizing without dissolving the polyolefin or other solid material. Some reagents were screened as to their suitability in stabilizing typical compositions by shaking 10 grams of pellets made in accordance with the reactants and procedure of Example 10, but having 30 total polyolefin with 2.5 ml hexane as the carrier media and a stabilizer in a bottle in a bath at 65 for one hour, evaporating the carrier and then heating in an oven for a period of time and comparing the color of the resulting materials. Results are given in TAble 11. Of those listed, the butyltin mercaptoacetate ester, the nonylphenyl phosphite and the alkyltin maleate are most effective in keeping the color of the pellets to a minimum. The latter material, a solid, seems to be surprisingly more effective when used with ethanol as a solvent than it is when either alone or with other solvents. Reactions were carried out in accordance with Example 2. Pellets as described in Example 1, initiator, and monomer were added to a reactor and heated with stirring at 60 to make product. In Example 24C, product from one reactor was added back to the reactor with more monomer and initiator and the process repeated. In Example 24B, after initial reaction the reactor was cooled to charge more initiator and monomer and then heated to continue the reaction. Examples in Table 13 illustrate the synthetic scheme. In the control Example 24A, a product with 8.1 total polyolefin was made of which 65 was pellets and 34 powder. In Example 24B a product with 18 total polyolefin was prepared and only 3 was powder. One more monomer addition step would be required to bring this into the same range as the control. In Example 24C, a product having 9 total polyolefin was prepared with minimal powder in two of the three steps and none in the other. A 115 gram sample of the pellets was worked on a mill at 176.6 C 350 F with 2 grams of dibutyltin mercaptoacetate ester stabilizer and 2 grams of acrylate process aid for 5 minutes, sheeted out and compression molded at 176.6 C 350 F and 6.89 MPa 1000 psig into a 15.24 15.24 cm 6 x 6 Plaque 0.32 cm 1 8 thick. This plaque when placed on a printed page had sufficient clarity to read the printing through it vs a plaque from the control which was too opaque to read through. The sample was cut into samples for testing. These had 0.712 m.Kg cm 13.1 ft. lb. in. impact in the notched Izod test vs 1.077 m.Kg cm 19.18 ft. lb. in. for the control. Both failed in a ductile fashion with crease whitening. A 2 1 2 gallon reactor equipped with a turbine type agitator was charged with 0.7 ml of a 75 solution of sec butyl peroxydicarbonate and 7.25 Kg 16 lb. vinyl chloride. The agitator was operated at 1200 rpm during the reaction time which consisted of 18 minutes heating to 1.17 MPa 170 psig and 35 minutes at this pressure to a low degree of conversion of vinyl chloride. The resulting mass was transferred to a 18.9 ℓ 5 gallon reactor equipped with a helical stirrer set for 60 rpm and containing 90 grams of the polyolefin of Example 1, 1.8 ml of a 75 solution of sec butyl peroxy dicarbonate, 5.0g of decanoyl peroxide and 1.81 Kg 4 lb. vinyl chloride. The resulting mass was heated until the pressure in the vessel reached 1.17 MPa 170 psig and the jacket was maintained to hold this pressure for 3.75 h. At the end of this time the unreacted monomer was recovered and the reactor emptied. The product was screened yielding 6.07 Kg 13.4 lb. through 0.42 mm 40 mesh 75 powdery resin, 0.453 Kg 1 lb. 6 of larger particle size powder that passed a 2.00 mm 10 mesh screen but not 40 mesh, 2.1 lb. 12 of an on 2.00 mm 10 mesh fraction of which 0.86 Kg 1.9 lb. were in the form of pellets and 0.09 Kg 0.2 lb. agglomerated powder and scaley material, and finally 0.36 Kg 0.8 lb. 15 of reactor scrapings, etc. The powdery fraction was essentially free of polyolefin as judged by the fact that a film pressed from it at 180 C was clear. Also shaking a 10g sample with 200 ml dimethylformamide a solvent for PVC but not polyolefin was clear indicting that the PVC powder contains little or no polyolefin. Assuming that all of the polyolefin has remained in the pellets, then the pelletized product must contain 90 870 x 100 10.4 polyolefin and 89.6 PVC. Using the method of Example 1 the pelletized product was found to contain 17 graft copolymer with 8.4 9.4 grafted polyolefin in the product. When this pelletized material was converted to a plaque according to Example 24C, the product was found to have a notched Izod impact of 1.077 m.Kg cm 19.8 ft. lb. in Graft polymer and PVC are co manufactured in aqueous medium by first introducing water and suspending agent into a reactor, followed by the polyolefin of Example 1, the initiator of Example 25, and vinyl chloride. The mixture is agitated and the reaction temperature is raised to 70 C for ten hours. The resulting product comprises 15 percent of pellets of graft polyolefin and the remainder PVC powder. The vinyl halide graft polymers of the invention can be used to modify the properties of polyvinyl halide. To illustrate, the product of Example 11A was blended with an injection molding grade PVC homopolymer along with 2 parts dibutyltin mercaptoacetate ester stabilizer and 2 parts acrylate process aid. The blend was compounded on a Farrell two roll mill at 176.6 C 350 F and then compression molded into 15.24 15.24 0.32 cm 6 6 1 8 sheet using a Carver press at 176.6 C 350 F 6.20 MPa 900 psig followed by cooling under pressure. Samples were cut from the sample for testing by the notched Izod method ASTM D256 . The results are illustrated in Table 14. Sample 27A in which PVC was mixed with the grafted polyolefin at the ratio of 5.25 to 1 had brittle failures and low values in the Izod test. However when the PVC was mixed with the grafted polyolefin at the ratio of only 4.3 parts for each part of the grafted polyolefin the impact was 0.75 m.kg cm 13.9 ft. lb. in. with all ductile type failures. At still lower PVC to grafted polyolefin, higher impact values can be achieved. Other materials have been blended and examined in a similar fashion. As a control, if the starting polyolefin of Example 1, 15 parts, is blended with 100 parts PVC and processed as above, the notched Izod impact of the blend is 0.076 m.kg cm 1.4 ft. lb. in . A blend of the product from the low conversion reaction product in Example 9 15 parts with 100 parts PVC or calculated 10.5 total polyolefin had an Izod of 0.10 m.kg cm 1.9 ft. lb. in. When this product was reacted further as in Example 10, and the product blended with PVC homopolymer to have only 7.9 polyolefin it had 0.94 m.kg cm 17.3 ft. ib. in. impact. The product of Example 12 when blended with PVC homopolymer to have 7.8 polyolefin in the final product, the molded material had 0.78 m.kg cm 14.4 ft. lb. in. of notched Izod impact. The product of Example 13, Table 3Z, when blended with PVC to have 8 total polyolefin, 35 pellet composition, 65 PVC and treated as above had 0.72 m.kg cm 13.3 ft. lb. in. impact. Other molded materials prepared by blending the products of Examples 2 8 to have 708 polyolefin also had high notched Izod impact strengths with ductile type failures. Similar results are obtained when the product of Example 11A is blended with PVC and mixed with the same additives as in Example 27, and then injection molded into test bars using an Arburg 200 injection molding machine with zone settings at 160 171 C 320 340 F and the mold at 37.7 C 100 F . The mix conditions include 1 milling as above followed by grinding, 2 milling the grafted polyolefin with part of the PVC, grinding, followed by mixing in the rest of the PVC in a Brabender plastograph with Haake 3 4 extruder attachment with screw L D at 24 to 1 with zones set at 170 180 C, 3 blending the pellets, additives and homopolymer in a Henschel high speed mixer followed by passing through the extruder in 2 and 4 as in 3 except that the material was passed 2 times. The results of the impact testing on the material compounded in different ways is given in Table 15. The data in Table 14 show that high impact values are obtained at above about 5 , grafted polyolefin. Also the 6.3 grafted polyolefin sample showed good retention of impact on heat aging and on accelerated weathering. A blend of 30 parts of a grafted polyolefin prepared according to Example 10 but having 30 polyolefin with 70 parts of an injection molding grade of chlorinated PVC was milled with stabilizer and process aid as above, compression molded and tested as in the PVC examples above. The Izod impact and heat distortion temperature at 1.82 MPa 264 psi were determined for this material and for a similar PVC blend. These are noted in Table 16. The plastic made with the chlorinated PVC has a higher heat distortion, with still good impact and ductile type failure, than does the material made with the PVC homopolymer. Other blends with other grades of chlorinated PVC can have higher heat distortion temperatures. It is possible to blend any of the compositions prepared according to Examples 1 21 above with polymers such as PVC or chlorinated PVC as just disclosed in Examples 24 26 or with other polymers or copolymers to achieve desired results such as impact resistance, clarity, fire retardance, compatibilization of non compatible polymers or other special properties. Table 17 illustrates the blending of several of the compositions prepared in Examples 1 21 with homopolymer, copolymers, and mixtures of polymers. These were mixed using a 5g sample of material on a small lab two roll mill heated to 193.3 198.8 C 380 390 F The products were mixed for 2 5 minutes depending on the ease of mixing the components. The milled sample was then pressed out on a Carver press at 180 C and about 0.689 MPa 100 psi pressure, into a specimen which after cooling was bent, cut and torn to evaluate possible physical properties. Particularly desirable blends are those that have good clarity, that bend with difficulty and or when bending hinge rather than break or crease whiten when they do break, and or are cut without cracking and or when torn at the end of the cut show resistance, break in an irregular manner, whiten, etc., rather than snapping. In Table 17, composition A shows that an unmodified commercial styrene acrylonitrile copolymer processed well to give a clear sample which shattered when it was bent, cracked when it was cut, and snapped when it was torn at the end of the cut. In blend B, PVC blended with the polybutadiene polyethylene reacted with styrene and methylmethacrylate at 4 1 gave a clear film that bends with crease whitening and without breaking, is cut without cracking, and which breaks in two different ways when the cut is torn. The 3 2 blend did not mix well at the mill temperature. The mixture Z of PVC with a butadiene styrene block polymer reacted with styrene and methylmethacrylate has similar properties. Other examples suggest impact modifiers for polystyrene E, Y , polymethyl methacrylate H, I. N Styrene acrylonitrile copolymer G, M, S , PVC W, X and acetal resin Q . The composition of Example 15C where a pellet polyolefin was reacted first with vinyl chloride and then methylmethacrylate and then is blended with PVC and poly methyl methacrylate V is essentially clear with good toughness. Examples AA, AB, and AC illustrate how a grafted polyolefin can be used to make a more compatible blend between high density polyethylene and PVC. The two polymers by themselves mix very poorly AA . Twenty percent of a grafted polyolefin composition improved the mixing AB but 30 of a grafted polyolefin prepared from a 2 1 blend ethylene propylene diene with HDPE and reacted with vinyl chloride to contain 50 polyolefin and 50 PVC was much more effective AC in giving a tough PVC HDPE blend. The blending to make two noncompatible components more compatible as illustrated by AA to AC in Table 17 can also be extended to scrap reclaiming. Polyethylene scrap frequently contains 5 10 parts of PVC or polystyrene which adversely effects the properties of the reprocessed scrap. If on the other hand 10 15 parts of a grafted polyolefin by vinyl chloride, styrene or other monomer depending on the scrap impurity composition of the invention is added, the minor plastic becomes more compatible with the polyethylene and maintains the properties of the recovered material. In a similar way, high strength PVC and EPDM blends, and fire retardant EPDM materials can be prepared by blending PVC with EPDM in the presence of 10 30 parts of composition 11B or other example.
