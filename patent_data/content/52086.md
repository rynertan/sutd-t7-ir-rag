## Description
Process for producing flavone derivatives with medicinal activity .This inventions relates to a new process for producing flavone derivatives of formula EMI1.1 in which R is H or a disaccharide radical R1 is OH or OCH3 R2 is H or OE. In particular, the new process relates to the production of diosmin of formula EMI1.2 in which R is a rutinose residue, and of apigenin of formula t EMI1.3 Both diosmin and apigenin are products which have been known for a very long time, as they are products of natural origin obtainable by extraction from various types of plant. Small quantities have been prepared by various processes generally used for the production of flavones, in order to determine their structure and test their,acti vity.In recent years both diosmin and apigenin have found various interesting pharmaceutical uses, which have posed the previously non exi stent problem of producing said produots industrially.In particular, it has been found that diosmin is a product which is excellent for the venous system and as a hepato protector, whereas apigenin has good spasmolytio activity both on the smooth musculature in general and on the bronchial musculature, in addition to having a good anti inflammatory and anti shock activity. Both these products. have the great advantage if total lack of toxicity.The problem of industrially producing diosmin and apigenin has proved difficult to solve, both with regard to the economics of the process and with regard to the purity of the final product.In this respect, known processes generally use costly raw materials and always have very low yields. In addition, the products obtained contain small percentages of by products related to the production process used, and are absolutely unacceptable in a pharmaceutical pro duct. A process has recently been proposed for diosmin which, in contrast to the previous processes, is considered an industrial process German Pub. Appl.2,602,314 of 12.1.78 . This process, which uses hesperidin as its starting substance, is characterised by the formation of the double bond in the 2 3 position by bromination and dehydrobromina tion. A new industrial process has now been founds and forms the subject matter of the present invention which enables compounds of formula I , and in particular diosmin and apigenin, to be produced starting from low cost raw materials, with high yields and pharmaceutical purity.The new process comprises the following essential stages 1 total acetylation of flavanone 7 glucoside of formula t EMI3.1 in which K is a disaccharide radical R1 is OH or OCH3g R2 i8 H or OH, by heating to 90 1000C with acetic anhydride and pyri dine 2 oxidation of the acetyl derivative of the flavanone 7 glucoside prepared in the preceding stage, using selenium dioxide in iso amyl alcohol, in order to form a double bond in the 2 3 position by selective dehydrogenation, to give s EMI3.2 in which R3 is a totally acetylated disaocharide radical R4 is OAc or OCH3, R5 is H or OAc Ac is an acetyl radioal .3 alkaline hydrolysis with dilute inorganic bases at 1000C in order to eliminate all the acetyl groups and restore the hydroxyl funct ions, to give s EMI3.3 in which R, R1, K2 are as defined under point 1 . 4 acid hydrolysis with dilute inorganic acids under reflux, in or der to separate the disaccharide radical R and form a hydroxide in position 7, to give t EMI4.1 This stage is obviosuly optional, and is carried out only if the required product is an aglycone and not a glucoside.If the process according to the present invention is applied to the production of diosmin, the starting substance is hesperidin or hespe retin 7 rhamnogluooside of formula t EMI4.2 in which R is a rutinoes radical.The octoacetyl derivative of hesperidin is prepared by heating with acetic anhydride and pyridine at 95 100 C for 5 6 hours.The hesperidin octoacetyl is precipitated by adding H20 to the react ion mixture and then cooling, and is purified by crystallisation. It is then dissolved in isoamyl alcohol and treated with an approximately 1 10 molar excess of SeO2 under reflux for 24 hours.The diosmin octoacetyl formed in this manner is hydrolysed with 15 NaOH by heating to 100 C for t 15 minutes.The diosmin of formula II precipitates on oooling and acidi4ing, and is purified by base acid treatment.If the process according to the present invention is applied to the production of apigenin, the starting substance used is naringin or naringenin 7 rhamnogluooside of formula s EMI5.1 in which R is a rutinose radical.The naringin is totally acetylated by heating at 90 1000C for 5 6 hours with an excess of acetic anhydride and pyridine.The octoacetyl naringin which precipitates by adding H20 to the reao tion mixture and then cooling, is dissolved in isoamyl alcohol and treated with an approximately 10 molar excess of SeO2 under reflux for 24 hours.The unsaturated 2 3 octoacetyl derivative of formulaEMI5.2 is formed, in which R3 is a totally acetylated rufinose radical, andAc is COCH3, and this is treated with dilute alkalis, preferably with 15 NaOHs at 1000C for t 15 minutes.The apigenin 7 rhamnogluooside precipitates by cooling and acidifying with strong mineral acid, and is crystallised from methanol from which apigenin is obtained by hydrolysis with strong dilute acids, preferably 18 H2SO4, under reflux.Both the diosmin and apigenin obtained by the process according to the present invention are of pharmaceutical purity.The final overall yield both of diosmin and apigenin is about 60 .A further important aspect of the process according to the present invention is the faot that the raw starting materials used are gluoosides, in this case hesperidin and naringin, which are available in large quantity and low price in the discarded parts of oitrus fruits.Compared with the only known industrial process for preparing diosmin the said German Pub. Appi. 2,602,314 , the advantage of the new process is that the use of bromine is avoided, this being a reagent which at the industrial level creates great environmental hydiene and effluent pollution problems.Two actual preparation examples are given hereinafter, for non limiting illustration purposes. only, in order to allow a more complete understan ding and easy reproduction of the process according to the present in vention.ExAMPLE 1Synthesis of diosmin from hesperidin.1 The following are fed into a 2 litre flask 48 g of hesperidin 78.6 moles 600 ml of acetic anhydride. 100 ml of pyridine.
