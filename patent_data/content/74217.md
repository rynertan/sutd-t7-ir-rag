# IDENTIFICATION CARRYING MEANS

## Abstract
Identification carrying means 1 comprises a sheet of heat resistant transparent material 2 secured to a sheet of adhesive 3 that is pressure sensitive and heat activatable, at least part of one major surface of the adhesive sheet 3 being covered by a release layer 7 to define a space between said sheets. Identification means such as a slip of paper can be placed in this space. The carrying means is placed on a substrate to which it becomes bonded by virtue of the pressure sensitive nature of the adhesive. The bond is made stronger by heating.
