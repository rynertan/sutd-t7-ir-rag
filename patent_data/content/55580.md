# Automated banking system.

## Abstract
In an automated banking system, a customer at a remote site enters a personal identification number PIN, an account number ACCN, a bank identification number BIN, a PIN OFFSET related to PIN, and transaction data and limits. A first controller validates ACCN and generates a first transaction identification number TRAN 1 and a transaction request TREQ. A second controller receives PIN, BIN, ACCN, and TRAN 1 from the first controller and generates a PIN OFFSET 2 from PIN, BIN and ACCN and a TRAN 2 from TRAN 1 . A third controller receives TREQ, ACCN, TRAN 1 and transac tion limits for transfer to a central computer, and generates TRAN 2 if transaction limits are met. The first controller compares TRAN 2 and TRAN 2 , and PIN OFFSET 1 and PIN OFFSET 2, and issues transaction control signals, and the second controller thereupon transacts the business. The third controller may be on line or off line with the central computer.
