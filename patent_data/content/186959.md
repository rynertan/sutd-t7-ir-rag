# Photosensitive polyurethanes and plates.

## Abstract
Photopolymeric polyurethanes are provided which have a polymeric backbone including recurring urethane or urea groups or both and which have unsaturated hydrocarbon groups attached to this backbone. These photopolymers are combined with a solvent and have a selected and controlled molecular weight and viscosity. The photopolymeric polyurethane solutions are especially useful in providing plates that have a layer includ ing a photopolymer, particularly plates for printing or photoresists that have a photopolymeric layer over a layer of light sensitive diazonium composition.
