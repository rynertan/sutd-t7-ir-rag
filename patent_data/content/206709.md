# AUTOMATIC OPTICAL INSPECTION OF PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS

## Abstract
A camera 11 provides video data of a surface of a scanned printed circuit board 12 in real time to comple mentary fine and coarse flaw detectors 16, 17 which, respectively, detect flaws less than or greater than a pre determined feature size. The fine flaw detector 16 comprises programmed logic arrays for detecting different flaw types within a small patch of pixels. The image at the camera 11 is broken down into a succession of such patches for fine flaw detection. The coarse flaw detector 17 compares video data from the camera 11 with a stored master of the surface under inspection, a reference buffer memory 19 being coupled to the coarse flaw detector 17 for this purpose. The comparison is carried out by breaking the scanned surface data input patches.
