# Laser scanning utilizing facet tracking and acousto pulse imaging techniques.

## Abstract
Apparatus for improving the efficiency and resolution of laser scanning systems using a multi faceted rotating polygon 27 as the scanner device. An acousto optic Bragg cell 30 is utilized as an active optical element to both mod ulate, in response to an electrical input signal, and deflect an incident laser beam so that the modulated beam is caused to follow, or track, one facet 28 of the scanner during a com plete scan and to shift to the adjacent facet for the following scan. The scanning system is operated in a manner wherein during recording the images of the acoustic pulses at the surface of a recording medium 14 are made to move at the same relative velocity, in the opposite direction 13 , as the velocity of the laser recording beam 12 whereby imaging of the input electrical signal on the recording medium surface 14 is accomplished without blurring.
