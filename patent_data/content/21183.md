# Ceramic material processing.

## Abstract
An illustrative embodiment of the invention provides a technique for applying the deep heat capabilities of microwave energy to the problems of ceramic ware production. A plaster of paris mold, filled with slip is exposed to microwave energy to produce a green body in a few minutes. After excess slip is decanted and the green body is exposed, the mold is dried through microwave heating, weighed and then brought up to the proper degree of moisture by spraying and weighing. The green body , moreover after finishing is further dried through microwave heating.
