# Data communication system with capabilities to analyse an error or problem condition.

## Abstract
A communication system is provided in which one data transmitting display terminal 10 has the capability of trans mitting a data stream in coded form to at least one data receiving terminal 11 over a communication linkage 12 . This data transmitting terminal 10 further includes the capability of displaying, when necessary, the stream of coded data directly on its display so that if there is a trans mission problem, the coded data itself can be analyzed in diagnosing the problem. The present communications sys tem has the further capability of diagnosing data streams at remote display terminals. For example, if one transmitting terminal 10 is communicating with a receiving terminal 11 and a problem arises between the two terminals, the system provides the capability of the transmitting terminal 10 sending the data stream to another receiving terminal remote from the first two terminals. This remote receiving terminal is a display terminal having the capability of dis playing the received stream of coded data whereby the problems between the two communicating terminals may be diagnosed at a remote location where better engineering support may be available.
