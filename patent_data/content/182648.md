## Abstract
Polyaryletherketones are prepared by polymerisation of a halogen containing aryl ketone in the presence of a stoichio metric excess of a base and a copper salt. The halogen contain ing aryl ketone may be 4 chloro 4 hydroxybenzophenone. A basic copper salt may be used but the base used to provide the excess of base is an alkali metal hydroxide, carbonate or bicar bonate.
