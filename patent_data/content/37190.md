# Method of electrolytically decontaminating components of nuclear reactor system.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an improved method of elec trolytically decontaminating components of a nuclear reactor system without causing attack or corrosion on their surfaces. It uses a nozzle 2 for conducting a stream of electrolyte solution, such as sulfuric acid, with an electrical potential applied between the nozzle and the piece of equipment 12 to be decontaminated. The method provides a means by which the exposure time of the component to the electrolyte is controlled so that the total amount of current transported to the surface may not exceed a predetermined value. This minimizes corrosion of the component while effectively decontaminating the component. Pits resulting from exten sive corrosion act as catch areas for radioactive fusion products which necessitates recleaning before work is done. This invention eliminates such possibility.
