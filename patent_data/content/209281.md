## Description
iL LdAntien The present invention relates to the cloning of the gene encoding the neurotoxin of Clostridium tetani, its expression and the use of the expression product in the manufacture of vaccines.Tetanus is a highly infectious, world wide disease caused by the organismClostridium tetani. Its spores can remain dormant for indefinite periods in house dust and soil which are the prime sources of Infection for open wounds.Contaminated animal faeces are also responsible for the spread of the disease and may further contaminate previously uninfected locales.Tetanus infection is always a risk for the wounded and is usually associated with great pain and may even lead to death. Thus, in the nineteenth century, when the causative agent was discovered to be a bacterium, great effort was devoted to the development of an effective vaccine. The first successful vaccination in human subjects was carried out in 1926, when the vaccine used comprised crude tetanus toxin treated to render it atoxic.Tetanus toxin provided the target for the first vaccine as It had already been discovered that symptoms are not due to the bacterium infecting host cells but rather by a potent neurotoxin released upon lysis of the bacterial cells.To obtain sufficient toxin requires large cell cultures which tends to give rise to toxin being contaminated with cell debris. The resulting toxin is rendered toxic toxoided by treatment, usually with formaldehyde, but may also be toxoided with glutaraldehyde. However, while rendering the toxin harmless, either treatment may also lead to conjugation of the toxin with cell contaminants, which in turn may lead to possible sdverse clinical reactions.In vivo, a single parent peptide is synthesised, according to the genetic template, which comprises both light and heavy chains. On lysis of the bacterial cell, an endogenous protein cleaves the peptide between a preexisting disulphide bridge to give two peptide chains linked by a disuiphide bridge. Papain cleaves the heavy chain to give a 8 fragment i 100,000 MW consisting of the light chain and part of the heavy chain, and a C fragment 5O,0OO MW , consisting of the remainder of the heavy chain. It has been shown that both fragments are capable of providing protection but may be associated with residual toxicity which would be due to contamination with uncleaved toxin Helting et al., J.Biol. Chem. 1977 252, 187 193 . By MW is meant the apparent relative molecular weight as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate and standard molecular weight markers. Molecular weight may thus be conveniently determined by the techniques described by U.K. Laemmli, Nature, 1970 227, 680485. Convenient standard molecular weight markers include, for example, phosphorylase B 9.3 x 104 MW , bovine serum albumin 6.8 xMW , aldolase 3.9 xl04 MW , triose phosphate isomerase 2.7 x 104 MW , ovalbumin 4.5 x 104 MW and carbonic anhydrase 2.9 x 104 MW .It has now been discovered that the DNA sequence encoding tetanus toxin may be cloned and used to express tetanus toxin or an immunogenic fragment thereof. Thus, both B and C fragments, heavy and light chains and even the whole toxin may be obtained in greater yields and or without one or more of the disadvantages of the prior art.Thus, the present invention provides a cloned DNA sequence substantially encoding tetanus toxin or a peptide comprising at least one epitope thereof.The term cloned is used herein in reference to any DNA sequence which has been substantially synthesised outside of its natural host, either naturally or chemically.The term peptide as used herein pertains to any molecular structure composed primarily of amino acids and comprising more than 2 amino acids. It will be appreciated that tetanus toxin is a peptide by this deffnition. The term epitope as used herein denotes an immunogenic determinant of an immunogenic molecule, the immunogenic determinant comprising a molecular configuration capable of eliciting a protective immune response in a susceptible animal, when presented in a suitable form. The DNA sequence according to the invention may correspond to any naturally occurring sequence encoding tetanus toxin, or it may correspond to a mutated form of such a sequence, possible mutations including single or multiple base substitutions, deletions, insertions and inversions, the sequence, in any event, always encoding, in either positive or negative sense, at least one epitope of tetanus toxin.In a preferred aspect, the DNA sequence corresponds to at least part of that shown in Figure 1 or Figure 4, or is a sequence of substantial homology at least 50 , the negative strand of which is capable of cross hybridisation with that shown in Figure 1 or Figure 4, or is a sequence which differs from either of the fore going only bscause of the degeneracy of the genetic cods.Moreover the DNA sequence according to the invention may encode a peptide of greater or lesser length than any dssired peptide fragment as DNA manipulation techniques do not necessarily conveniently give rise to DNA sequences corresponding to desired peptides. Thus, for example, a DNA sequence substantially encoding the C fragment may not encode the first 30 amino acids of the fragment or, alternatively, it may also encode the last 30 amino acids of the B fragment.A DNA sequence according to the invention may be obtained by the following procedure. A culture of C.tetani is grown for 3 days and then lysed In concentrated salt solution and tetanus toxin fragment C isolated and crystallised from the lysate. The oligopeptide N termInal sequence of fragmentC is then determined In an automated sequencer and a family of labelled oligonucleotides synthesised which correspond to possible DNA coding sequence for part of the oligopeptide. These oligonucleotides may then be used as a probe to identify a fragment of total digest genomic DNA on nitrocellulose. Genomic DNA fragments of approximately the MW detected by the probe are then cloned into a suitable plasmid e.g. pAT153 and used to transform a suitable host e.g. E.coll 3M101 . Colonies are then picked and tested for hybridisation to the oligonucleotide probe. Any recombinant clone thus selected may then be used to generate further clones by using the insert DNA as a probe to identify further genomic DNA fragments. In this way, it Is possible to generate a selection of clones encoding the entire tetanus toxin sequence. Excision of the inserts, treatment with nucleases and insertion into expression plasmids allows the expression of the fragments as peptides.In a further embodiment of the invention, there is provided a synthetic peptide comprising at least one epitope of tetanus toxin. In a yet further aspect of the invention there is provided a non pathogenic virus provided with a DNA sequence according to the invention which may be used to provide immunity to tetanus in a susceptible vertebrate host by expressing the said sequence in vivo.The invention also provides a non pathogenic virus as defined above, further capable of providing immunity to other infection s by similar means, which may be administered jointly, or individually, together with any other vaccine.In another feature of the present invention there is provided an expression vector, containing a DNA sequence according to the invention, tandemly linked to an amino terminal coding portion of a gene translatable by the relevant host and, optionally, further comprising any control sequences associated therewith.In a further feature of the present invention there is provided a fusion peptide comprising the amino terminal portion of a host peptide, and the carboxy terminal being provided by at least one epitope of tetanus toxin.In an alternatIve aspect of the invention, there is provided an expression vector comprising a gene capable of translation in a suitable host, optionally provided with relevant control sequences, into which is inserted a DNA sequence according to the invention suitably altered such that the portion of said gene carboxy terminal to said DNA sequence is correctly translated on expression in a suitable host to produce a fusion protein comprising at least a part of tetanus toxin or a peptide comprising at least one epitope thereof and part of said geneencoded protein.According to a further feature of the present invention there is provided a method which comprises transforming a host cell with a cloning vector comprising the DNA sequence according to the invention and culturing the host cell to provide expression of tetanus toxin, or a peptide comprising at least one epitope thereof.According to a further feature of the present invention there is provided a vector containing the DNA sequence according to the present invention.In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a vector containing theDNA sequence according to the invention, further containing one or more control sequences to regulate the expression of said DNA sequence. In a further embodiment of the invention there is provided a method for synthesising at least a portion of tetanus toxin or a peptide comprising at least one epitope thereof, said tetanus toxin or peptide being optionally covalently linked to further peptide sequence, which method comprises the steps of a creating a cDNA or genomic DNA library from Clostridium tetani b selecting a probe for tetanus toxin DNA and rendering the said probe radio active c selecting a member or members of the said library by use of the said probe and d using DNA thus selected from the said library to transform a suitable host which may be used to express the said tetanus toxin or a peptide comprising at least one epitope thereof. In a further aspect there is provided a vaccine capable of inducing immunity to tetanus which comprises tetanus toxin, or a peptide comprising at least one pitope ffiereof, obtained by any process described herein, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a preferred aspect of the invention, there is provided a vaccine as described above, which comprises the B fragment, the C fragment, the light chain, the heavy chain and the toxin, or peptides substantially corresponding thereto, either ilngly or kany combination, when obtained by any process as described herein. There t, in a further aspect, provided a method for inducing immunity to tetanus in a susceptible vertebrate host, comprising the administration of an effective amount a vaccine, as hereinbefore defined, to the host. The invention will be described In more detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows the base sequence of a stretch of C. tetani DNA and the corresponding amino acid sequence. Figure 2 shows a restriction endonuclease map of part of the tetanus toxin gene and the relative position of certain clones. Figure 3 is a less detailed restriction map covering the entire tetanus toxin gene. Figure 4 shows the base sequence of the DNA fragment encoding the Nterminus of the light chain of tetanus toxin.Figure 1 1A, 1B, 1C and 1D shows the base sequence of a stretch of C. tetaniDNA encoding part of the B fragment and all of the C fragment of tetanus toxin and the corresponding amino sequence. The 3 letter amino acid codes and one letter nucleotide codes are according to convention. The sequence was determined by methods described herein and it will be appreciated that, while it has been determined as accurately as possible within the margins of experimental error, there may be some variation between the sequence shown in the Figure and the actual tetanus toxin genetic sequence. The papain cleavage site is located at position 366.Figure 2 shows a restriction endonuclease map of the C fragment and part of the B fragment of tetanus toxin. The one letter codes indicate restriction enzymes as follows E EcoRI B BglII S SacII and K KpnI . Other enzymes are as shown. is used to indicate the site of the labelled oligonucleotide binding. Also shown is the relative size and position of the inserts of the indicated plasmids. The numeral I represents a stretch of C.tetani DNA, II represents the relevant position of part of the toxin and B and C indicate the position of the B and C fragments in the toxin.Figure 3 is an extended version of Figure 2 covering the whole gene. This figure is to scale and the scale of Figure 2 may be judged accordingly. Letter codes are as for Figure 2 but fewer restriction sites are noted due to the larger scale. Figure 4 shows DNA and corresponding amino acid sequence for the N terminus of the tetanus toxin light chain. The general description for Figure 1 also applies to Figure 4 insofar as codes and sequencing are concerned.The DNA sequence according to the invention may also be characterised as having substantially the restriction map as shown in Figure 2 determined as described herein.The genetic sequence was determined by the dideoxy method Sanger, et al., 1977 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 74, 5463 5467 after sub cloning fragments of the target DNA into the bacteriophage cloning vectors M13mp8 Messing, J. andVieira, J 1982 Gene 19, 269 276 , M13mpl8 and M13mp19 Norrander, J., et al., Gene, 26, 101 106 . Using the sequence data shown in Figure 1, it will be appreciated that a peptide corresponding to any part of the sequence may be synthesised wing for example, the methods described by Merrifield, R.B., and Marglin, A. Ann. Rev. Biochem., 39, 841 et seq. 1970 . The term synthetic as used herein relates to peptides produced by a chemical method, for example as described above.Cloning of the whole tetanus toxin gene may be carried out by the use of total genomic DNA digest libraries which are prepared readlly, and the relevant sequence, or fragments thereof, detected in such a library by the use of a suitable probe, e.g. see Example 2. A proportion of sequences found by this technique may be full length DNA sequences as required, though many will be fragments of such a sequence. In order to determine which clones in the library represent a part of the DNA sequence desired, a method known as 1chromosome walking Hadfield, C., Focus 5, 1 5 1983 Betheeda Res.Labs. may be employed, which method entails the use of known fragments probes to detect other fragments by cross hybridisatlon. These freshly located sequences may themselves be used as probes and, in this way, the whole sequence of DNA substantially encoding tetanus toxin can be identified and cloned. Using such procedures, a restriction map characteristic of the DNA sequence may also be prepared.The construction of a physical map of the gene for tetanus toxin in genomicDNA by restriction endonuclease cleavage, gel electrophoresis, transfer to nltrocellulose or polyamide membranes and hybridisation to specific probes derived from the cloned DNA is extremely useful to confirm the orientation and position of genomic clones and preparation of new clonesViruses may be used as hosts for the DNA sequence according to the invention.For example, a strain of vaccinia virus Tk unable to confer upon infected cells the ability to grow on media not containing hypoxanthine is used to infect a tissue culture. The tissue culture may then be transformed with the tetanus toxin gene, or fragment s thereof, linked to a Tk genetic determinant. Some of the subsequent viral progeny will have such transforming sequences in the form of inserts in their genomes. These can then be selected by their ability to confer upon tissue culture cells the ability to grow on media devoid of hypoxanthine. Such colonies as do grow are then further selected for production of tetanus toxin, or peptides comprIsing at least one epitope thereof, for example by use of human immune serum.Such vaccinia strains can then be used to infect animals susceptible to tetanus, as the new vaccinia strain will cause production of a protective immunogenic tetanus peptide s .It will be appreciated that such vaccines are also readily capable of providing immunity to other infections, such as smallpox, diphtheria, hepatitis B, rabies, herpes simplex virus, whooping cough and the like, by incorporation of the relevant DNA sequences.Based on the above described characterisation of the DNA sequence for tetanus toxin the cloning of any desired fragment of the sequence is possible by reference to the DNA sequence or the restriction map so gained.The insertion of a piece of foreign DNA into an E. coli gene in the correct reading frame allows the expression of a fusion protein, in which part of the amino acid sequence is derived from the E. coli gene and part of it is derived from the inserted DNA. Suitable expression vectors with appropriate control sequences and convenient restriction sites have been constructed, which allow high levels of expression of fusion proteins.Thus, examination of the restriction map of the expression system of choice and the sequences to be expressed, together with a knowledge of the translational frame, enables specific DNA fragments to be ligated into the expression vector and expressed, without further manipulation. For example, pWRL507 is a plasmid constructed from pAT153 and the trpE gene Nichols, B.P. et al., J.Mol. Biol. 146, 45 54 1981 with a synthetic EcoRI Bgl II linker inserted at theBgl II site at nucleotide 1223 in the trpE gene.By using suitable restriction enzyme sites, DNA fragments from the tetanus toxin gene sequence may be cloned into a site within the trpE gene in the correct orientation, but usually in the wrong translational frame. In order to obtain expression of the inserted sequence, a synthetic linker of suitable length can be inserted into the restriction site between the trpE gene and the insert, to give in frame expression of the fusion protein. Alternatively the plasmid containing the inserted DNA can be opened at the unique restriction site between the bacterial and the inserted DNA and the DNA treated briefly with the enzyme Bal 31 to remove a few bases from each end of the linearised DNA.After repair with the large Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, the plasmid is recircularised with T4 ligase and used to transform bacteria. One in three of the transform ants should contain the tetanus toxin sequence in the correct reading frame to be expressed as a fusion protein with the trpE gene product. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the extent of digestion with Bal 31 will determine the final size of the expressed fusion protein and the relative lengths of trpE and tetanus toxin sequences contained therein. In addition, the insertion of a synthetic linker during ligation after Bal 31 digestion and repair facilitates the analysis of particular strains after transformation. By the judicious use of specific restriction enzyme digestion and Bal 31 enzyme treatment, any specific region of tetanus toxin can be expressed as a fusion protein.Alternatively, nuclease S1, which preferentially degrades single stranded DNA, can be used to digest away the sticky end of the BglII restriction site to leave a blunt end. Recircularisatlon of the plasmid will then put the Inserted DNA in a new, and possibly correct, reading frame.An alternative method for expressing DNA fragments Is to use an open reading frame ORF vector into which usually short pieces of DNA can be inserted, often within the sequence coding for the N terminal amino acid sequence of anE. coli protein. The inserted DNA must contain no stop codons In the correct translational frame, be in the correct orientation relative to the direction of transcription, and be in the correct frame at each end. For pieces of DNA from a protein coding sequence generated by a random cleavage method, the theoretical probability of read through in the correct frame Is 1 in 18. ORF vectors based on ss galactosidase have been described Koenen et al., 1982 . Insertion of a piece of DNA into a site at the N terminus of the protein In the correct frame confers read through expression of the ss galactosidase protein which can be detected by hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate 5 bromo4 chloro 3 indolyl ss D galactoside Xgal . For example if Xgal is included in the agar upon which the colonies are grown, transformation of a suitable host strain with a plasmid expressing a functional ss galactosidase will produce a blue coiony. One such vector, pXY46O, contains the ss galactosidase gene under the control of the tac promoter. Insertion of DNA into the Sma I site next to theEcoRI site may convert the gene to in frame expression.Transformation of anE. coli host such as JM105 converts the bacteria to ampicillin resistance and expression of the fusion protein can be induced at high levels by the addition of isopropyl B D thiogalactopyranoside IPTG . The peptide coded by part of the tetanus toxin gene in a fusion protein may be cleaved from that fusion protein by enzymic or chemical cleavage of the appropriate peptide bond. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art which enzymic or chemical cleavage method should be employed, by examination of the amino acid sequence expressed. By insertion of a synthetic oligonucleotide linker between the tetanus toxin DNA sequence and the bacterial gene sequence in the fusion protein expression system, a suitable site may be provided for enzymic or chemical cleavage between the tetanus toxin sequence and the remainder of the expressed fusion protein. In this way the tetanus toxin geneencoded fragments may be purified away from host peptides.Direct expression of the coding sequence for the tetanus toxin protein or parts thereof can be achieved by placing the inserted DNA sequence directly after anAUG start codon in the correct reading frame such that the DNA insert replaces the coding sequence normally transcribed and translated by the bacterial control region. Such a control region includes a promoter and a ribosome binding site in the optimal position relative to the start codon. TheDNA sequence to be expressed may be correctly positioned by the use of suitable restriction sites and if necessary by using a suitable synthetic oligonucleotide linker. At the end of the inserted DNA sequence a stop codon may be inserted in the correct reading frame to stop translation and a terminator sequence to stop transcription may be added.The inserted DNA to be expressed may be the entire coding sequence of tetanus toxin or the entire sequence from which the amino terminal signal sequence has been removed, or preferably a part of the coding sequence corresponding to an immunogenic fragment of the protein. Suitable fragments may be prepared by restriction enzyme digestion of a suitable DNA clone after examination of the nucleotide sequence and, if necessary, further treatment at either or both ends with Bal 31 to digest away parts of the DNA sequence in a controlled manner.Controlled digestion is achieved by the selection of proper buffer, temperature, reaction time and amount of enzyme, for example as described in Example 7.At this stage a suitable synthetic linker may be added, preferably by blunt end ligation to the insert, to provide an AUG start codon or facilitate ligation into the expression vector.Controlled expression of any cloned fragment will be possible by use of the sequences at either end of the sequence, or by use of other sequences already known. Such sequences include promoters and enhancers. Examples of such promoters include lac, trp, bacteriophage pL and hybrid trp lac tac . Suitable enhancers include the SV4O enhancer and the enhancer from bovine papillomavirus.The vector referred to abova may be any appropriate vector which is suitable for the cloning of the DNA and which may be used to transform a host cell and thereby express the relevant protein. Such vectors include plasmids, bacteriophages and cosmids. Vectors which may be used for cloning cDNA include pUCB, pUC9, pAT153, pBR325 and pBR328 for use in Escherichia coli, pBD9 and pKT438 for use in Bacillus subtilis, pMA56 for use in yeast and pAdD26SV A 3, pSV2 dhfr, SVEHA3 and SVLHA8 for use in mammalian cells.Vectors for use in expression of the relevant protein will include control sequences, such as mentioned above. Such vectors include pry460 and pWRL 507 for use in E.coli or pSV2 dhfr for use in mammalian cells.Examples of suitable host cells for use in the above described method may be prokaryotic, such as bacteria for example E.coli HB101 and DH1, B. subtilis sp.BD170 and IH6140 , or eukaryotic, such as yeast for exampie XV610 8C yeast cells or mammalian cells for example simian CV 1 cells .The present invention further includes the said tetanus toxin protein or peptides comprising at least one epitope thereof, when obtained by any of the above methods according to the invent ion. These materials may be incorporated into a vaccine for conferring immunity against tetanus. For this purpose the antigenic protein, or a peptide comprising at least one epitope thereof, may be presented in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.The antigenic proteins or peptides may be used either singly or in combination with other tetanus toxin epitope containing peptides e.g. C and B fragments together or with other antigens which will provide immunity against tetanus. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, in this instance, are liquid media suitable for use as vehicles to introduce the immune peptide into the patient. An example of such a carrier is saline solution. The tetanus toxin or peptide may be in solutionor suspended as a solid in the carrier, or it may be solubilised by the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable detergent s .The vaccine may also comprise an adjuvant for stimulating the immune response and thereby enhancing the effect of the vaccine. A convenient adjuvant for use in the present invention is aluminium hydroxide.Conveniently the vaccines are formulated to contain a final concentration of tetanus toxin or peptide in the range of from 0.2 to 200 llg ml, preferably 5 to 50 iig ml, most preferably 15 iiglml. After formulation the vaccine may be incorporated into a sterile container which is then sealed and stored at a low temperature, for example 40C, or it may be freeze dried.In order to induce immunity in vertebrate hosts to tetanus one or more doses of the vaccine suitably formulated may be administered. It is recommended that each dose is 01 to 2 ml preferably 0.2 to 1 ml, most preferably 0.5 ml of vaccine.The vaccines may be administered by any conventional method for the administration of vaccines including oral and parenteral eg. subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. The treatment may consist of a single dose of vaccine or a plurality of doses over a period of time. The following examples are for illustration only and are not intended to limit the invention in any way.Example 1 C. tetani DNAC. tetani strain CN3911 was grown for 30 hours in 600 ml Mueller medium Mueller, J.H., et al., J. Immunol. 1954 50, 377 384 . The cells were pelleted by centrifugation 10 min, 5000 rpm using a Sorvall GS3 rotor and resuspended in 20 ml 50mM Tris HC1 pH8.0, 5mM EDTA, 50mM NaC1 TES . The cells were centrifuged 10 min, 10,000rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor and resuspended in 8 mlTES containing 25 sucrose. Lysozyme was added to 2 mg ml and the cells incubated at 37 0C for 20 min. 3.2ml 0.25M EDTA was added and incubation continued at 37 OC for 25 min.The cells were lysed by the addition of 7.2 ml 2 Sarkosyl in TES followed by incubation for 10 min at 37 0C and 10 min at 4 0C. Protease K was added to 10 mg ml and the lysate left overnight at 50 OC. Eight ml of lysate was added to 35 ml of a solution containing 69.6 g CsC1 and 55.2 ml 10mM Tris HC1 pH8.0 , lmM EDTA TE . PMSF was added to 50 pg ml and the solution centrifuged at 36000 rpm for 48 hours at 20 0C in aBeckman 70.1 Ti rotor. The C. tetani DNA, which was visible as opaque lumps in the clear solution, was withdrawn from the gradient using a wide bore syringe and was dialysed extensively against TE. The DNA was extracted once with phenol and several times withXether followed by precipitation with ethanol at 20 OC. The DNA was resuspended to 1 mg ml and stored at 20 OC. Example 2 Crystalline Fragment CTetanus toxin was produced by lysing with 1M NaC1 organisms obtained from a 3 day culture of the Harvard strain of C.tetani grown in Mueller medium. It was purified by fractional precipitation with potassium phosphate 1.75M, pH8.0 followed by adsorption to DEAE cellulose equilibrated with 0.01M sodium phosphate pH7.2, 0.2M EDTA. The purified fraction wes equilibrated by dialysis against 0.1M Na phosphate pH6.5 0.1M EDTA. Fragment C was prepared from this material by the procedure of Helting and Zwisler Helting,T.B., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1977 252. 187 193 using crystalline papain derived from crude enzyme according to the method of Kimmel and Smith J. Biol.Chem. 1954 207, 515 531 .Crystalline Fragment C was obtained by concentrating by vacuum dialysis either the appropriate fraction obtained from the Sephadex G100 column or the digestion mixture followed by dialysis against water. Several crops were obtained on further dialysis. Recrystallisation was achieved by dissolving the fragment C in 0.5M sodium chloride followed by dialysis against water. Almost quantitative yields of fragment C were obtained under these conditions. It was found that crystallisation reduced the residual toxicity of fragment C but did not eliminate it altogether even after twelve recrystallisations It was always necessary to adsorb the fragment C with a column of adsorbed tetanus antitoxin coupled to Sepharose 48 as described by Helting and Zwisler supra in order to eliminate all residual toxicity.The purified fragment was finally dialysed as a crystalline suspension and freeze dried. Example 3 Identification of Tetanus Toxin DNA a Design of Synthetic Oligonucleotides The sequence of the first 30 amino acids of purified fragment C was obtained by automated Edman degradation. The sequence obtained was Lys,Asn,Leu,Asp,Cys,Trp,V al,Asp,Asn,Glu,Glu,Asp,Ile,Asp,Val,Ile,Leu,Lys, Lys,Ser,T hr,Ile,Leu,Asn,Leu,Asp,Ile,Asn,Asn,Asp. This was analysed for the longest possible stretch of amino acids giving the least degenerate oligonucletide mixture. The sequence of residues 6 11 and a family of 32 oligonucleotides, each of 17 bases length, is shown in Table 1 where the bracketed nucleotides indicate possible variations . One of these oligonucleotides would be expected to be complementary to DNA and mRNA encoding fragment C.This family of oligonucletides was synthesised with mixtures of bases included where indicated and labelled with 32P ATP.

A prominent band of 2kb was identified in the EcoR1 digest and fainter higher molecular weight fragments with Pst1, Kpnl and HindIII. 100 iig of C. tetani DNA was cleaved with EcoR1, electrophoresed oxa 0.7 agarose gel and the DNA purified from the region containing fragments of approximately 2kb.This pool of 2kb EcoR1 fragments was cloned into EcoR1 cleaved and dephosphorylated plasmid pAT153.One hundred recombinant clones were picked and the colonies were screened by hybridisation to the mixed oligonucleotide probe. Seven clones were identified showing varying degrees of reaction with the probe. Plasmid DNA was prepared from the seven clones and EcoR1 digests were probed by Southem blotting.Four plasmids contained 2.0kb EcoR1 inserts which hybridised to the oligonucleotide mixture and one of these plasmids, named pTetl, was studied further. A restriction map of th6 insert in pTetl is presented in figure 2.Further Southern blot experiments showed that only fragments containing the central 300 base pairs of the 2kb insert hybridised to the probe. Thus the sequence encoding the amino terminus of fragment C was located to the centre of the 2kb EcoR1 fragment.DNA sequence analysis See Example 3 revealed that the 2kb EcoR1 fragment did not contain the entire coding region of fragment C. Therefore, adjacent restriction enzyme generated fragments were identified by southern blotting using pTetl as a probe. A 3.2kb BglII C. tetani fragment was cloned into the vector pWRL507 at the BglII site to generate pTet8. This fragment contains the 1.4kb ByIll EcoRi fragment present in pTetl and the adjacent 1.8kb EcoR1 Bglll fragment see figure 2 .To obtain clones encoding the remainder of the B fragment of tetanus toxin including the light chain , the C. tetani insert of pTetl was used as a probe to yield a 1 kB Bgl II fragment of C. tetani DNA. This was cloned into pUC8 to form pTetl4. pTetl7 was then constructed by deleting the Eco R1 fragment from pTetl4. The resulting 400 bp Eco Ri Hind llI fragment from pTetl7 was subsequently used to identify and clone, by similar procedures to the above, a 1.8 kbp C. tetani DNA fragment into pAt 153 to make pTet 20. Sequencing of this fragment Example 5, figure 4 shows a likely Shine andDalgarno sequence boxed followed by open reading frame from base 35. Thus, pTet 20 encodes the N terminal of tetanus toxin and, together with pTet 1 and pTet 8, encodes the entire tetanus toxin gene. Example 4 An Expression Plasm it Encoding the Entire C FragmentPlasmids pTet6 and pTetlO do not encode the terminal 91 amino acids of fragment C. Derivatives of these plasmids which do contain the DNA encoding this region were constructed as follows. pTet8 was cleaved with restriction enzymes PstI and SacII and the 5.35 kb fragment purified. Similarly pTet6 and pTetlO were cleaved with Pstl and SacII and fragments of 2.3kb and 2.75kb were purified. The PstI Sacll fragments of pTet8 and pTet6 were ligated and transformed into E. coli DH1 to form the recombinant plasmid pTetll 7.7kb .Similarly the Pst1 Sacll fragments of pTet8 and pTetlO were ligated to form pTetl2 8.lkb . pTetll would be expected to express a fusion protein containing part of the trpE gene and 440 of the 451 amino acids of fragment C. pTetl2 would be expected to express a fusion protein consisting of part of the trpE gene, 122 amino acids of fragment B and the whole of fragment C 451 amino acids . pTetll and pTetl2 produce cross reacting proteins of 86,000MW and 101,000MW. These values are consistent with the structure of the plasmids and of the utilisation of the termination codon at nucleotide 1720 figure 1 .E.coli strain DH1 containing pTet12 has been deposited with the National Collection of Type Cultures, 61 Colindale Ave., London NW9 5HT on 28th June, 1985, and has been assigned the serial no. NCTC 11918.Example 5 Nucleotide Sequence of the DNA Coding for Tetanus ToxinSequence analysis of the DNA was performed using the dideoxy procedure ofSanger supra .DNA templates were prepared by subcloning fragments of inserts in the filamentous phage cloning sequencing vectors M13mp8 Messing and Vieira, 1982, supra , M13mp18 or M13mp19 Norrander, 3., et al., Gene, 1983 26, 101106 . The sequencing was performed using a synthetic universal primer Celltech end 35S dATP alpha S Amersham International as described by Sanger et al. supra . The basic strategy used to sequence specific fragments was to take specific restriction fragments produced by digestion with any or a combination of RsaI, SatAflA, SspI, EcoRI, BglII, Sail, AccI, Alum, KpnI, Hinfi, Aha III which were then purified by electro elution, and where necessary, the staggered ends made blunt using the Klenow DNA polymerase I fragment.DNA was ligated with phosphatase treated endonuclease digested cloning phage and transfected into E.coli JM101 Messing, J., et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 9, 309 1981 . Template DNA was prepared according to standard procedures.Wherever possible, sequence was obtained from both strands of each clone.The sequence shown in figure 1 encodes the entire C fragment and the carboxy terminus of the B fragment. Translation of the entire sequence in both strands revealed only one open reading frame encoding a protein of 63kD. Translation of nucleotides 367 457 gives an amino acid sequence identical to that determined for the first 30 amino acids of fragment C, confirming that the clones do indeed encode a portion of tetanus toxin. The amino terminal residue of fragment C is lysine, which is in agreement with the results of Helting Neubauer, V., Helting, T.B., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1977 86, 635 642 .The calculated molecular weight of fragment C is 51,562 daltons, a value in close agreement with our own measurements data not shown and with those ofHelting 1977, supra .Figure 4 shows the DNA sequence encoding the amino terminal portion of the light chain of tetanus toxin. The bases enclosed in a box correspond to the sequence shine Dalgarno required for ribosome binding and the putative Nterminal amino acid methionine is encoded at base 35.Example 6 Restriction Map of Part of the Tetanus Toxin GeneC. tetani DNA from plasmids pTetl and pTet8 was prepared as described byManiatis et al. 1982 Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual and aliquots were restricted with specific endonucleases, either individually or on some occasions as a double digest, i.e. with two restriction endonucleases. The products were electrophoresed on agarose gels 0.5 in Tris Borate EDTA pH 8.2 containing 0.5 ligiml Ethidium bromide and together with DNA fragments of known length as size markers in parallel tracks. An analysis of the size of restriction fragments from within the cloned DNA enabled a linear map of restriction enzyme sites to be constructed. A detailed map of the tetanus toxin gene corresponding to the C fragment is shown in Fig. 2, and a less detailed map of the whole gene is shown in Fig. 3. Example 7 TrpE Tetanus Fusion Proteins.Recombinant plasmid containing strains of E. coli DH1 were grown overnight at 370C in 10 ml M9 medium Maniatis, T., et al. 1982 Molecular Cloning, ALaboratory Manual containing 50 pg ml ampicillin. The cultures were diluted 1 in 5 into fresh medium containing indoylacrylic acid 10 pg ml and grown for 4 hours with shaking. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and the polypeptides visualised by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described by Fairweather, N.F., et al. Infection and Immunity 1982 41, 1112 117 .Western blotting was carried out as described Towbin, H., et al., Proc. Nat.Acad. Sci. 1979 76, 4350 4354 using 3 haemoglobin to block non specific binding to nitrocellulose. Anti fragment C125 antibody was used at a dilution of 1 in 50 and proteins were visualised using 125I protein A 50 000 cpm ml . The fusion proteins expressed would be expected to consist of amino terminal residues of the trpE product anthranilate synthetase and carboxyterminal residues of tetanus toxin. The 1.4kb BglII EcoR1 frgment of pTetl was cloned into the BglII EcoR1 sites of pWRL507 to generate pTet4. No fusion protein containing tetanus toxin sequence was obtained as the BglII sites in pTetl and pWRL507 are not in phase.To generate fusion proteins in the same reading frame, two approaches were used.1. pTet4 was cut with Bglll and digested with exonuclease Bal 31 for various times. After ligation and transformation into E. coli DH1, 100 colonies were picked and analysed by a solid phase immune screen for the presence of induced proteins reacting with anti fragment C antibody. One clone containing a plasmid designated pTet6 was identified as reacting strongly with antibody data not shown . The fusion protein was visualised by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis both as a stained band and by Western blotting. The size of the fusion protein, 70kD, is consistent with a deletion of approximately 400bp which was confirmed by restriction mapping data not shown . DNA sequence analysis showed the exact size of the deletion to be 400 bp, the fusion protein encoded by nucleotides 163 1182 of trpE Yanofsky, C.T., et al., Nuc. Acid Res. 1981 9, 6647 6666 and nucleotides 399 1446 of tetanus DNA. 2. The phase around the BglII site of pTet4 was also altered by using nuclease S1. S1 preferentially degrades single stranded DNA and so should digest away the sticky ends of the BglII fragment to generate blunt ends. Examination of the sequence around the BglII site of pTet4 shows that 51 treatment folowed by ligation should place the trpE and tetanus sequence in the same reading frame and should result in a trpE tetanus fusion protein. pTet4 was treated with BglII, S1 and T4 ligase and was transformed into DH1. One transformant, containing a plasmid pTetit , which lacked a Bglll site was examined for production of a hybrid protein upon induction. A band of 93kD was produced which reacted with anti C fragment antibody.The D4A in pTet4 does not encode the entire C fragment, lacking the 35 bases. Derivatives of pTet6 and pTetlO were constructed which did contain the DNA encoding the entire C fragment. These plasmids, pTetll and pTetl2 also produced cross reacting fusion proteins of 86 and 101kD respectively. The sizes of the fusion proteins produced by these plasmids are consistent with the utilisation of the termination codon at nucleotide 1720 see Figure 1 .3. pTetl3 was constructed from 2 plasmids, pXY460 and pTet8. The 3.2kb Bgifl fragment, containing all the C fragment DNA and a piece of the B fragment DNA, was prepared from pTet8 and was ligated to pXY46O cleaved with BamHI. The ligation mixture was introduced into E.coli TG1 by transformation, and strains containing recombinant plasmids were analysed by restriction enzyme digestion. One plasmid, containing the 3.2kb BglII fragment inserted into pXY460 in the correct orientation and which expresses a protein of the predicted size 63kD which reacts with anti C fragment sera, was selected and named pTetl3.4. pTetl6 was constructed as follows. The 3.2kb BglII fragment from pTet8 was purified and digested with SspI and Eco RI. The resulting fragments were ligated to plasmids pUC9 cleaved with Eco RI. The ligation reaction was introduced into E.coii TG1 by transformation, and pUO9 recombinants containing the Eco RI SspI fragment containing the 3 end of the tetanus toxin gene were identified by restriction enzyme digestion. One of these was selected and named pTet1. 5. pTetl8 was constructed by cleavage of pTetl3 with Kpnl and Sail and by ligation of this mixture of fragments to purified 320bp KpnI SalI fragment from pTetl6. This ligation reaction was introduced by transformation into E.coli. TG1 and recombinant plasmids were identified by restriction enzyme digestion and by reaction of the expressed proteins with anti C fragment sera. One of the recombinant plasmids consisting of the KpnI SalI fragment of pTetl3 which contains most of the tetanus toxin C fragment DNA, and the 320bp KpnI SalI fragment from pTetl6 was selected and named pTetl8.Example 8 Mouse Protection ExperimentsTwo recombinant plasmids were employed to test the ability of cloned DNA products, synthesised in E. coli, tó protect mice against a lethal challenge of tetanus toxin.1. pTetll Example 7 produces a fusion protein consisting of E. coli trpE residues and tetanus toxin residues. All except the first 10 residues of fragment C are present on this protein.2. pTetl8 Example 7 expresses a portion of fragment B and all of fragment C as a mature protein. It is not fused to a long length of host protein.a Protein Purification The procedures for the purification of the proteins produced by pTetll and pTetl8 are different, as they are controlled by different promoters, trp and tec respectively.1. pTetll. An overnight culture of E.coli DH1 containing pTet11 was grown in 200 ml M9 medium. After overnight growth, a further 800 ml fresh medium was added together with 5 mg IAA indoyl acrylic acid . Growth was continued for 4 hours.2. pTetl8. An overnight culture of E.coli HB101 was grown in 100 ml L broth. After overnight growth, a further 900 ml broth was added and the culture was grown for 5 hours.The subsequent procedure for both purifications was as follows.The cells were centrifuged 6000rpm, 10min and the pellets stored overnight at 40C. The pellets were thawed at room temperature then placed on ice. After resuspension in a total volume of 16 ml of solution 1 25 mM Tris HC1 pH8.0, lmM EDTA, 0.2 NP40, 1 mM PMSF , a further 4ml solution I containing 20 mg lysozyme was added and the mixture left on ice for 2 hdurs. 20p1 1M magnesium sulphate and 400p1 lmg ml DNase were added and the mixture left a further 2 hours on ice. The cells were then pelleted at 13000 rpm, 10 min, 4 0C and the supernatant S1 stored at 200C. The insoluble pellet was resuspended in 20ml 50mM Tris pH8.0, 5mM EDTA, 5mM EGTA, 1 NP40, lmM PMSF and centrifuged as above. The supernatant 52 was stored at 20 0C. The pellet obtained affer the second spin designated FP2 was resuspended in 20ml 0.85 sodium chloride and dialysed overnight at 4 0C. The dialysed material FP2 was frozen at 20 OC. Analysis by Western blotting revealed that the tetanus specific bands were enriched by this procedure. b . Mouse ProtectionMice were immunised with the FP2 protein prepared as follows.High dose 10ml FP2 protein from trpE, pTetil and pTetl8 was centrifuged and the pellet resuspended in 1.6ml saline.Low dose 2ml PF2 protein was centrifuged and resuspended in 1.6ml saline.Tween 80 and Freund s complete adjuvant was added as described below. 1.6 ml pellet 0.4 ml 10 Tween 80 2.0 ml Freunds complete adjuvant 4.0 ml Groups of 5 Balb c mice were injected subcutaneously with 0.2 ml of protein adjuvant mixture described above. Three weeks later a second injection was given. Five weeks after the second injection, the mice were challenged with approximately 100 LD50 doses of tetanus toxin. Control mice were injected with trpE protein, tetanus toxin fragment C or were not immunised at all The results are shown in Table 2.
