# Method and apparatus for calcining delayed petroleum coke.

## Abstract
Particulate carbonaceous material, for example delay ed petroleum coke, is calcined in an internally fired verti cal shaft kiln 10 . A downwardly moving bed of green coke is preheated in the top of the kiln by rising combus tion gases, then heat soaked at calcining temperatures in the intermediate section of the kiln, and finally cooled by recycle gas moving upwardly from the lower part of the kiln. Partially cooled calcined coke is recovered from the bottom of the kiln.
