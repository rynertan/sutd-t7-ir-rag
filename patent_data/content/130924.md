# Method and equipment for picking up antenna patterns in near fields.

## Abstract
Method and equipment for picking up the radiation pat tern of an antenna to be tested from measurements in near field. The antenna to be tested is illuminated by a transmit antenna having wavefronts in the shape of circular cylinders. The radiation pattern of the antenna to be tested then is expressed by an integral transform of a unidimensional func tion which is solved by computing means.
