# Snap on valve gasket.

## Abstract
A sanitary valve assembly including a valve and a field replaceable gasket. The gasket is formed with a plurality of resilient fingers which conform to a frusto conical surface of the valve head. The apex end of the valve head frusto conical surface is provided with a laterally extending shoulder. To assemble the gasket to the valve head, the gasket is pushed onto the valve head so that the fingers deflect as they contact the shoulder. Upon passing over the shoulder, the fingers snap back to their undeflected position to engage the shoulder and retain the gasket on the valve when in the relaxed condition. The gasket fits loosely on the valve head when the valve asembly is in the open position, thereby permitting the assembly to be cleaned in place by flushing washing fluid through the clearances between the valve head and gasket.
