# Process for the preparation of a substituted triazine.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of 2 chloro 4 ethylamino 6 isopropylamino s triazine atrazine herbicide in which cyanuric chloride is reacted in a first amination step with either isopropylamine or ethylamine to give either 2,6 dichloro 4 isopropyl amino s triazine or 2,6 dichloro 4 ethylamino s triazine respectively, which is subsequently reacted in a second amination step with either ethylamine or isopropylamine respectively, both reactions being performed in a mixed acetone water solvent and in the presence of an acid binding agent, characterised in that in the first amination step the molar ratio of cyanuric chloride to alkylamine is at least 1.04 1, and that subsequent to the first amination step but prior to the second amination step, the cyanuric chloride remaining in the reaction mixture is hydrolysed, using a sufficient quantity of a base to maintain the pH of the reaction mixture in the range of 6 to 11, to a water soluble salt of monohydroxydichlorotriazine.
