# Vehicle tire and method of making same.

## Abstract
A vehicular pneumatic tire which, except for bead cores 14, 15 is composed solely of an elastomer blend strengthened by molecular orientation. The blend is a monoolefin copolymer rubber with a polyolefin and sufficient curing agents to effect vulcanization when the blend is subjected to heat and pressure. The process for making the tire comprises preforming an annulus of the elastomeric blend with bead cores 14, 15 adjacent the edges, the diameter of the preform 10 being essentially that of the bead diameter of the completed tire and the axial distance between the beads less than the transverse arcuate dimension of the completed tire. The preform 10 is cured and while still hot following curing, is stretched and shaped to final size and the generally toroidal form characteristic of conventional pneumatic tires with resulting biaxial molecular orientation, which orientation is retained in the tire by cooling it below the melting point of the polyolefin before removing the tire from the mold.
