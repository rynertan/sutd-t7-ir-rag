# BATCH TYPE WATER HEATING APPARATUS

## Abstract
Batch type water heating apparatus 36 includes a heat exchanger 50 in which water is heated as it is circulated therethrough, a water storage zone 62 , a flow control device 70 , a water pump 42 , and associated water lines 60, 46, 44, 48 connecting these components to form a closed water circulat ing loop 76 . Additional water lines 44, 38 associated with the flow control device provide for the withdrawal of heated water from the loop and the addition of make up water to the loop as water is withdrawn therefrom. The flow control device includes a valve 72 and a thermostat 74 for sensing the water tempera ture at the outlet of the storage zone. The flow control device is operable to position the valve to facilitate withdrawal of heated water from the loop when the sensed temperature exceeds a predetermined value and to position the valve to facilitate circula tion of water around the loop when the sensed temperature is below a predetermined value.
