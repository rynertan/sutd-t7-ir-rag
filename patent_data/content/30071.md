# Process for the preparation of aluminium alloys.

## Abstract
Strontium modified aluminium alloys may be produced by using strontium peroxide as the source of strontium. The strontium peroxide may be mixed with molten aluminium or molten aluminium alloy in a quantity sufficient to give the desired strontium metal content in the alloy being produced. The temperature of the molten aluminium or aluminium alloy with which the strontium peroxide is mixed is preferably at least 1000 C. The strontium peroxide alloys produced may be master alloys for use in the production of casting alloys, or may be casting alloys. Strontium acts as a grain refiner in such alloys.
