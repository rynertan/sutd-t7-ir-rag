# METHOD OF PRODUCING DISORDERED MATERIALS

## Abstract
Disclosed are a method and apparatus for forming a filament of disordered material. The apparatus is a melt spinning system 1 having a chill surface means 3 and pressurizable reservoir means 7 . The reservoir means 7 are spaced from and beneath the chill surface means 3 and have an effluent orifice 11 located beneath the chill surface 3 and adapted to allow upward flow of the molten reservoir means contents to the chill surface 3 . The meth od of the invention contemplates providing molten material in the reservoir means 7 and pressurizing the reservoir means to form a negative meniscus 11 of molten material in contact with the chill surface 3 . In this way there is formed an edge defined filament of disordered material.
