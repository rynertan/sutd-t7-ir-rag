# Apparatus for performing operations on strip material.

## Abstract
Machine 2 for performing operations on strip material 4 comprises a plurality of modules 8 on a supporting bed 10 . Each module 8 has a strip feeder 32 , a tooling assembly 34 , and an actuating assembly 86, 160, 162 . Strip 4 is fed through the modules 8 by the feeder 32 and in each module the tooling assembly 34 performs an operation such as stamping, forming, marking, etc. The modules 8 feed the strip in a vertical plane and the modules are symmetrical with respect to the vertical plane of the strip 4 . Preferably the actuating assembly 86, 160, 162 and the tooling assembly 34 is dynamically balanced. Advantages achieved include high speeds, reduced power requirements, reduced noise, and reduced tooling cost.
