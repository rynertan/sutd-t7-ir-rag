# A METHOD OF CONTROLLING INTERMITTANT VOLTAGE SUPPLY TO AN ELECTROSTATIC PRECIPITATOR

## Abstract
In the method of controlling the period length of an inter mittant voltage supply to an electrostatic precipitator, a search procedure is carried out at predetermined time intervals or at time intervals determined by one or more continuously moni tored measured precipitator or operational parameters. During the search procedure either the number of system voltage half periods during which the power supply to the precipitator is cut off the length of the non conduction n
