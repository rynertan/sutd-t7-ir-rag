# A PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF HOLLOW TUBE LIKE MEMBERS

## Abstract
A process for the manufacture of a plurality of tube like members includes encapsulating a plurality of tube like members 11 in a body 10 of a composition containing a polymeric material and solid filler particles, so that the elongated passages of the tube like members are parallel to each other. The body is sliced normal to the passages to form slices with two parallel end surfaces, which are lapped. The passages are filled with a bonding agent and the surfaces rough polished. Some bonding agent is removed from the passages by use of a solvent and the surface fine polished. The remainder of the bonding agent is subse quently removed from the passages.
