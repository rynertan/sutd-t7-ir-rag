# Apparatus for and method of storing characteristics of an acoustic field.

## Abstract
An acoustic receiving transducer 46 receives acoustic energy in a field set up by an acoustic generator transducer 44 . The transducer 46 converts a parameter of acoustic energy into an electrical signal for storage. The acoustic receiving transducer 46 is moved to a plurality of predetermined co ordinate positions in the acoustic field by stepping motors 52,54 and 56 and at each co ordinate positions is rotated to angular positions by stepping motors 88,90 and 92. For each such position an electrical signal indicative of a parameter of the acoustic field is stored in a memory. The information in the memory is selectively retrieved to activate an electronic display means, and to expose film if desired, to provide a visual map of the acoustic field parameter detected.
