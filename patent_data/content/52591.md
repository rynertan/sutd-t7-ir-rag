# A method of laying and joining pipes and a lifting device for performing the method.

## Abstract
The joining of pipes, especially large concrete pipes, has heretofore been a comparatively cumbersome procedure necessitating the use of special tools by means of which a pressure has been exerted on the back end of the pipe to push it towards the last of the previously laid pipes. In order to simplify the laying and joining of the pipes, it is proposed that a pipe 1 which is to be joined to the latest laid pipe 2 in the pipe line 3 is placed in alignment in front of the end of the latest laid pipe 2 , that an asymmetrical two legged lifting strap 10, 11 is used, the shorter leg 10 of which is attached to that pipe 1 , which is to be joined to the latest laid pipe 2 in the pipe line 3 , at the end portion which is nearest to the joining end, that the longer leg 11 of the lifting strap is attached to one of the previously laid pipes 2 of the pipe line 3 , and that to the point of connection 7 between the legs 10, 11 there is connected a hoisting device 15 by means of which a slight vertical heave is effected, resulting in the pipe 1 being pulled in the direction towards the latest laid pipe.
