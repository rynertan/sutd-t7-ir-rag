## Description
Aromatic polycarbonates having relatively high modulus, flexural strength and secondary transition temperatures are well known in the art. One of the methods known of raising the secondary transition tem perature of polycarbonates while substantially main taining a significant number of the other properties of polycarbonate is to incorporate a significant number of ester bonds, particularly aromatic ester bonds. In this manner, a copolyestercarbonate is produced, see U.S.P. 3,169,121. Copolyestercarbonate with relatively high secondary transition temperatures are known, see U.S.P. 4,465,820 and U.S.P. 4,464,512, for example. However, none of these disclosures appear to mention the effect of having a substituent on the aromatic ester ring other than the usual hydrocarbyl , chloro , alkyl , etc. groups. A substantially sized, double heteroatom group has now been placed into the backbone of a copolyestercar bonate, the substantially sized double heteroatom group functioning as a side group instead of joining one repeating unit to another. This group provides a high flexural modulus as well as a high secondary transition temperature with fewer ester units than necessary in prior copolyestercarbonates. In accordance with the invention, there is a com position comprising an aromatic copolyestercarbonate having flexural modulus, flexural yield and secondary transition temperature improvement over a corresponding aromatic polycarbonate effective amount of ester units of the structure The copolyestercarbonates of this invention are prepared by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor and the aromatic ester precursor. The di hydric phenols employed in the preparation of the co polyestercarbonate are those typically used and are illustratively exemplified below 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane 2,2 bis 4 hydroxy 3 methylphenyl propane 4,4 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl heptane 2,2 3,5,3 5 tetrachloro 4,4 dihydroxylphenyl propane 2,2 3,5,3 ,5 tetrabromo 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl propane 3,3 dichloro 4,4 dihydroxyphenyl methane. Other dihydric phenols which are also suitable for use in the preparation of the above polycarbonates are disclosed in U.S.Patent Nos. 2,999,835 3,028,365 3,334,154 and 4,131,575. The carbonate precursors are the usual ones, phos gene preferred, as set out in U.S.P. 4,018,750 and 4,123,436, interfacial process or those used in trans esterification processes as in U.S.P. 3,153,008. The aromatic precursors of the amide containing unit of the polymer are set forth below These amide substituted iso and terephthalic acids of Figure 3 are prepared by reacting 1,2,4 benzene tri carboxylic anhydride, also known as trimellitic anhyd ride The preparation of the copolyestercarbonate of this invention can proceed by the usual known procedure. However, wherein certain of the monomers of Figure 3 are slow in incorporating into the chain as evidenced by low intrinsic viscosity values or a low maximum level of incorporation, slight modification of the usual reaction procedure are necessary. Typical reaction procedures that are employed are the mixing together of the dihydric phenol endcapping agent usually phenol or p.tert.butylphenol and then phosgenating the reaction vessel for a specified period of time, usually providing 10 to 20 more phosgene than theoretically necessary for total phosgenation in the usual type of interfacial polymerization. This poly merization uses aqueous alkaline pH and methylene chloride in the reaction procedure. As the mole per cent amide monomer incorporation goes upward to the 50 to 60 mole percent, the presence of a chain stopper is found to be essentially unnecessary since the reaction rate of incorporation of the amide appears to be con trolled by the reaction conditions. It has been found that better resin can generally be obtained by dividing the quantity of dihydric phenol into several portions. The initial portion being present with all the amide monomer and the remainder of the dihydric phenol added part way through the phosgenation. Generally this somewhat modified interfacial polymerization procedure will provide better resin than the standard procedure as measured by physical properties and purity. Al though not understood completely it is believed that the resin formation reactions are essentially a compe tition between two reaction sequences, one leading to an ester unit and one to a carbonate unit. The preparation of the copolyestercarbonate has been exemplified alone as a reaction between a dihydric phenol, a carbonate precursor, and an amide containing aryl diester precursor. Obviously more than one di hydric phenol can be present in the molecule, the pre ferred one being bisphenol A. It is also appropriate to have another aryl diester precursor present such as ordinary isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, acid chlorides of either acid or mixtures of both iso and terephthalic acid and their acid chlorides. The amount of amide monomer, i.e. Figure 3, in the copolyestercarbonate will generally vary from about 5 to about 60 mole percent based on the moles of dihydric phenol present. Preferred amounts are from about 10 to 50 mole percent. 192 g 1.0 mole of 1,2,4 benzenetricarboxylic anhydride Aldrich and 169 g 1.0 mole diphenyl amine Eastman Reagent were mixed in a 1000 ml 3 neck flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and with a condenser capped with a drying tube. The flask was warmed in a 90 C oil bath until the diphenyl amine was melted. To the flask was then added 250 g 2.5 mole, dried over 4 A⁰ molecular sieves triethyl amine. The temperature was raised to 110 C and then to 120 C. After 3 hours vigorous stirring, the reaction mixture had become a thick brown melt. After 8 hours reaction time, the heat was turned down to about 80 C for 16 hours over night then turned back to 120 C for one hour. An ir spectrum of the reaction mixture indicated negligible residual anhydride and strong amide and carboxylate salt groups absorbances. Excess triethyl amine that had collected on top of the reaction mixture was poured off. Then 375 ml distilled water was added to the hot melt to yield a clear brown solution. The solution was filtered into a 4000 ml Erlenmeyer flask, diluted with 1000 ml acetone, acidified to pH 1 with conc. aq. HCl about 150 ml . The solution was split into two equal portions and each portion diluted to 4000 ml with water to yield a granular precipitate. The precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration and any large lumps broken up, then washed 2x with 2000 ml water pH of second wash was 4 to 5 . After drying in a 45 C vacuum oven, a pale yellow powder was obtained. ir 1710 cm The following amides were prepared in essentially the same manner as the diphenyl amide of preparation A. The initial reaction product the bis triethylam monium salt of Figure 3 N,R₁ and R₂ as shown in Figure 6 appeared to partially crystallize as the reaction proceeded. A nearly solid reaction mixture resulted which could not be stirred and was not soluble in water. It was acidified as an aqueous slurry instead of in solution. Subsequent workup was the same as for A ir 1700 cm The reaction was carried out at the usual tempera ture 110 to 120 C for three hours, then the tempera ture was increased to 145 C for four hours. The higher temperature was necessary to allow stirring of the reaction mixture which became an extremely viscous, dark red melt as the reaction proceeded. Also, after 5 hours reaction time, more dicyclohexyl amine 9 g, 0.05 mole was added. Workup was the same as for A ir 1705 cm The flask containing only the 1,2,4 benzene tricar boxylic anhydride was first heated to 175 C to melt the anhydride. A mixture of 111 g 1.1 mole diisopropyl amine and 250 g 2.5 mole triethylamine was then added in portions over about 4 hours from an addition funnel at such a rate that refluxing was vigorous but con trolled. Reaction temperature was gradually lowered to 150 C during addition of the amines. This modified procedure was necessary because when the reaction was run in the usual manner all the amines added at the start the refluxing amines prevented the reaction mix ture from reaching a temperature at which reaction would proceed at a practical rate. Subsequent reaction and workup were the same as for A ir 1725 cm Copolyestercarbonate with 60 mole percent amide A 2000 ml 4 neck flask was fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a phosgene inlet tube, a pH probe and a Clais sen adaptor to which were connected a caustic inlet tube and a dry ice condenser. In the flask were mixed 85.5 g bisphenol A 0.375 mole , 81 g of the diphenyl amide, preparation A above 0.225 mole , 1.05 ml tri ethylamine, 420 ml water and 350 ml methylene chloride. With slow stirring and pH controlled at 7 to 8, phos gene was introduced into the flask at 0.3 g min. for 180 minutes. The stirrer speed was then increased and the pH was gradually raised from 9 to 10 at 190 min utes. Then 125 ml methylene chloride was added and the phosgene rate increased to 1.0 g min. At 213 minutes total phosgenation time, the reaction was terminated. The resin layer was separated from the brine layer, diluted with 250 ml methylene chloride, then washed twice with 0.01 N HCl and once with water and precipi tated in 3x volume of methanol in a Waring blender. The resin had an IV of 0.684 and Tg of 195.1 C and ir 1770 cm This basic procedure of Example 1 was used to pre pare the following resins. Modifications in procedure were made several times in the two variables, phosgena tion rate and methylene chloride level, when it ap peared necessary in order to produce resin of satis factory intrinsic viscosity. Generally, the slower the phosgenation rate or the lower the methylene chloride level, the better the reaction proceeded. Conditions are shown in the Table below. The quantity of methyl ene chloride added at the end of the reaction was vari able, depending on the amount in the initial formula tion and the resin intrinsic viscosity. Generally, only enough was added to allow stirring of the reaction mixture. ¹Reduced viscosity at 0.4 g resin 100 ml CH₂CL₂ at 25 C.
