# Rolled plate sectional profile control rolling method and rolling mill.

## Abstract
A rolling mill comprises a pair of crown work rolls 1.1 each having, at both ends of a drum, tapered ends ground at different taper angles 5,5 , respectively. The work rolls are located one above the other with one tapered end of one work roll being in opposition to one tapered end having a different taper angle of the other work roll. The work rolls are movable in axial directions, such that edges of the plates are rolled by one tapered end of one work roll and a drum of the other work roll, and between tapered ends of both the work rolls. The method and rolling mills are capable of controlling the crown and edge drop reduction and simultaneously preventing local protrusions such as high spots and edge built up to produce flat rolled plates having no difference in thickness and further capable of controlling the crown and the edge drop according to the material, thickness and width of the plates.
