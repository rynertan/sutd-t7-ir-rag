# Electrothermal printing apparatus.

## Abstract
An electrothermal printer uses heat developable strip 16 which is held on a sector of rotating platen 12 by an endless loop 30 passing over two rollers 22,24 . A stylus assembly 40 between the roller 22,24 can pass current via selected styli through parts of the loop 30 . The loop 30 has an outer electrically conductive layer and an inner electrically conductive and resistive layer which is contacted by the styli and is locally heated by the current flow. The loop 30 and paper 16 are in contact and move in synchronism over a common path section, when heat generated in the loop 30 transfers to and heat develops the paper.
