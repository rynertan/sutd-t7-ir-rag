# Video measuring system for defining location orthogonally.

## Abstract
Apparatus for determining the location of a physical feature, such as a hole 35 in a panel 11 , relative to two coordinate axes X, Y by optically scanning across the panel and hole from a reference 23, 46 while measuring the distance of the hole from the reference 46 and the length of the hole chord for each of a plurality of scans, then adding half the chord length to the respective distance to the hole edge and averaging the results for the plurality of scans. Scan lines used for the hole edge and chord measurement can be selected from among a plurality of scan lines having a predetermined chord length. The measuring apparatus can also be readily adjusted to accommodate a range of feature dimensions.
