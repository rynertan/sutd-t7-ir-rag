## Description
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING GEMINAL DIPHOSPHONATES TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds which are useful in treating or preventing diseases characterized by abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism, in particular those which are characterized by abnormal bone metabolism. This invention further relates to a method of treating or preventing diseases characterized by abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism using pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A number of pathological conditions which can afflict warmblooded animals involve abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism. Such conditions may be divided into two broad categories. 1. Conditions which are characterized by anomalous mobilization of calcium and phosphate leading to general or specific bone loss or excessively high calcium and phosphate levels in the fluids of the body. Such conditions are sometimes referred to herein as pathological hard tissue demineralizations. 2. Conditions which cause or result from deposition of calcium and phosphate anomalously in the body. These conditions are sometimes referred to herein as pathological calcifications. The first category includes osteoporosis, a condition in which bone hard tissue is lost disproportionately to the development of new hard tissue. Marrow and bone spaces become larger, fibrous binding decreases, and compact bone becomes fragile. Osteoporosis can be subclassified as menopausal, senile, drug induced e.g., adrenocorticoid, as can occur in steroid therapy , disease induced e.g., arthritic and tumor , etc., however, the manifestations are essentially the same. Another condition in the first category is Paget s disease osteitis de formans . In this disease, dissolution of normal bone occurs which is then haphazardly replaced by soft, poorly mineralized tissue such that the bone becomes deformed from pressures of weight bearing, particularly in the tibia and femur.Hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and osteolytic bone metastases are conditions also included in the first category. The second category, involving a conditions manifested by anomalous calcium and phosphate deposition, includes myositis ossificans progressiva, calcinosis universalis, and such afflictions as arthritis, neuritis, bursitis, tendonitis and other inflammatory conditions which predispose involved tissue to deposition of calcium phosphates. Polyphosphonic acids and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts have been proposed for use in the treatment and prophylaxis of such conditions. In particular diphosphonates, like ethane 1 hydroxy 1 , 1 diphosphonic acid EHDP , propane 3 amino 1 hydroxy 1,1 diphosphonic acid APD , and dichloromethane diphosphonic acid Cl2MDP have been the subject of considerable research efforts in this area. Paget s disease and heterotopic ossification are currently successfully treated withEHDP. The diphosphonates tend to inhibit the resorption of bone tissue, which is beneficial to patients suffering from excessive bone loss. However, EHDP, APD and many other prior art diphosphonates have the propensity of inhibiting bone mineralization when administered at high dosage levels. It is believed that mineralization inhibition is predominantly a mass related physico chemical effect, whereas resorption inhibition results from a biological interaction with the cells. It is therefore desirable to develop more biologically potent diphosphonate compounds that can be administered at low dosage levels which cause little or no mineralization inhibition, thereby resulting in a wider margin of safety. Low dosage levels are also desirable to avoid the gastro intestinal discomfort like diarrhea sometimes associated with oral administration of large quantities of diphosphonates. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide high potency compositions for the treatment and prophylaxis of ab normal calcium and phosphate metabolism. It is a still further object of this Invention to provide an Improved method for treating diseases characterized by abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism.

By pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters as used herein is meant hydrolyzable esters and salts of the diphosphonate con pounds which have the same general pharmacological properties as the acid form from which they are derived, and which are acceptable from a toxicity viewpoint. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include alkali metal sodium and potassium , alkaline earth metal calcium and magnesium , non toxic heavy metal stannous and indium , and ammonium and low molecular weight substituted ammonium mono , di and triethanolamine salts. Preferred compounds are the sodium, potassium, and ammonium salts. By pharmaceutical carrier as used herein is meant one or more compatible solid or liquid filler diluents or encapsulating substances. By compatible as used herein is meant that the components of the composition are capable of being commingled without interacting in a manner which would substantially decrease the pharmaceutical efficacy of the total composition under ordinary use situations. Some examples of substances which can serve as pharmaceutical carriers are sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose starches such as corn starch and potato starch cellulose and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ethylcel lulose, cellulose acetate powdered tragacanth malt gelatin, talc stearic acid magnesium stearate calcium sulfate vegetable oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and oil of theobroma polyols such as propylene glycol, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, and polyethylene glycol agar alginic acid pyrogenfree water isotonic saline and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non toxic compatible substances used in pharmaceutical formulations.Wetting agents and lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate, as well as coloring agents, flavoring agents, lubricants, excipients, tableting agents, stabilizers, anti oxidants and preservatives, can also be present. Other compatible pharmaceutical additives and actives e.g., vitamin D or vitamin D metabolites, and mineral supplements may be included in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention. The choice of a pharmaceutical carrier to be used in conjunction with the diphosphonates of the present compositions is basically determined by the way the diphosphonate is to be administered. If the compound is to be injected, the preferred pharmaceutical carrier is sterile, physiological saline, the pH of which has been adjusted to about 7.4. However, the preferred mode of administering the diphosphonates of the present invention is orally, and the preferred unit dosage form is therefore tablets, capsules and the like, comprising from about 0.1 mg P to about 600 mg P of the diphosphonic acid compounds described herein.Pharmaceutical carriers suitable for the preparation of unit dosage forms for oral administration are well known in the art. Their selection will depend on secondary considerations like taste, cost, shelf stability, which are not critical for the purposes of the present invention, and can be made without difficulty by a person skilled in the art. The pharmaceutical carrier employed in conjunction with the diphosphonates of the present invention is used at a concentration sufficient to provide a practical size to dosage relationship. Preferably, the pharmaceutical carrier comprises from about 0.01 to about 99.99 by weight of the total composition. EXAMPLE I Capsules are prepared by conventional methods, comprised as follows Ingredient Mg per capsuleN 2 3 picolyl AMDP 100 as mg P Starch 55.60 Sodium lauryl sulfate 2.90 The above capsules administered orally twice daily for 6 months substantially reduce bone resorption in a patient weighing approximately 70 kilograms afflicted with osteoporosis.Similar results are obtained when the N 2 3 picolyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid, or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester, in the above described capsules is replaced withN 2 5 amino pyridyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 5 chloro pyridyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 4 picolyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 5 picolyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 6 picolyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 3,4 lutidine aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 pyrimidyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 pyridyl 2 aminoethane 1 , 1 diphosphonic acid 2 2 pyridyl ethane 1,1 diphosphonic acid 2 3 pyridyl ethane l ,1 di phosphon ic acid 2 4 pyridyl ethane 1 , 1 diphosphonic acid 2 2 pyridyl 1 hydroxy ethane 1,1 diphosphonic acid 2 3 pyridyl 1 hydroxy ethane 1,1 diphosphonic acid 2 4 pyridyl 1 hydroxy ethane 1,1 diphosphonic acid 0 2 3 picolyl oxamethane diphosphonic acid or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters thereof. EXAMPLE II Tablets are prepared by conventional methods, formulated as follows Ingredient mg per tabletN 2 pyrimidyl AMDP 25.00Lactose 40.00 Starch 2.50Magnesium stearate 1.00 The above tablets administered orally twice daily for 6 months substantially reduce bone resorption in a patient weighing approximately 70 kilograms afflicted with osteoporosis.Similar results are obtained when the N 2 pyrimidyl AMDP, or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester, in the above described tablets is replaced withN 2 5 amino pyridyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 5 chloro pyridyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 3 picolyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 4 picolyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 5 picolyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 6 picolyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 3,4 lutidine aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 pyridyl 2 aminoethane l,l diphosphonic acid 2 2 pyridyl ethane 1,1 diphosphonic acid 2 3 pyridyl ethane 1,1 diphosphonic acid 2 4 pyridyl ethane 1,1 diphosphonic acid 2 2 pyridyl 1 hydroxy ethane 1,1 diphosphonic acid 2 3 pyridyl 1 hydroxy ethane 1,1 diphosphonic acid 2 4 pyridyl 1 hydroxy ethane 1,1 diphosphonic acid O 2 3 picolyl oxamethane diphosphonic acid or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters thereof. EXAMPLE III Injectable solutions are prepared by conventional methods using 1.0 ml of either physiological saline or water solution and 3.5 mg of 2 2 pyridyl ethane 1,1 diphosphonic acid, adjusted to pH 7.4. One injection, one time daily for 4 days results in appreciable alleviation of hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients weighing approximately 70 kilograms.Similar results are obtained when the 2 2 pyridyl ethane 1 ,1 diphosphonic acid in the above described treatment is replaced withN 2 5 amino pyridyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 5 chloro pyridyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 3 picolyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 4 picolyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 5 picolyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 6 picolyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 3,4 lutidine aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 pyrimidyl aminomethane diphosphonic acid N 2 pyridyl 2 aminoethane 1,1 diphosphonic acid 2 3 pyridyl ethane 1,1 diphosphonic acid 2 4 pyridyl ethane 1,1 diphosphonic acid 2 2 pyridyl 1 hydroxy ethane 1,1 diphosphonic acid 2 3 pyridyl 1 hydroxy ethane 1 , 1 diphosphonic acid 2 4 pyridyl 1 hydroxy ethane 1,1 diphosphonic acid 0 2 3 picolyl oxamethane diphosphonic acid or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters thereof. The compositions of the present invention are useful in the treatment of abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism. Other diphosphonic acids and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts have been proposed for use in the treatment and prophylaxis of such conditions. In particular, ethane 1 hydroxy 1,1 diphos phonic acid EHDP , propane 3 amino 1 hydroxy 1,1 diphosphonic acid APD , and dichloromethane diphosphonic acid Cl2MDP have been the subject of considerable research efforts in this area. However, the compositions of the present invention are generally more biologically potent in inhibiting bone resorption than the art disclosed diphosphonates. Thus, the compositions of the present invention may provide one or more of the following advantages over the art disclosed diphosphonates of 1 being more potent in inhibiting bone resorption 2 possessing less potential for inhibition of bone mineralization, since mineralization inhibition is believed to be predominantly a mass related physico chemical effect 3 having generally a wider margin of safety i.e., wider dosing interval between the lowest effective antiresorptive dose and the lowest dose producing mineralization inhibition 4 allowing lower oral dosages to be administered, thereby avoiding the gastro intestinal discomfort like diarrhea sometimes associated with higher dosages of diphosphonates and 5 having potential for flexibility of dosing methods. Another aspect of this invention is a method for treating or preventing diseases characterized by abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism, in particular those which are characterized by abnormal bone metabolism, in persons at risk to such disease, comprising the step of administering to persons in need of such treatment a safe and effective amount of a diphosphonic acidcontaining composition of the present invention. The preferred mode of administration is oral, but other modes of administration include, without limitation, transdermal, mucosal, sublingual, intramuscular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous administration, as well as topical application. By abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism as used herein is meant 1 conditions which are characterized by anomalous mobilization of calcium and phosphate leading to general or specific bone loss, or excessively high calcium and phosphate levels in the fluids of the body and 2 conditions which cause or result from deposition of calcium and phosphate anomalously in the body. The first category includes, but is not limited to, osteoporosis, Pagets disease, hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and osteolytic bone metastases. The second category includes, but is not limited to, myositis ossificans progressiva, calcinosis universalis, and such afflictions as arthritis, neuritis, bursitis, tendonitis and other inflammatory conditions which predispose involved tissue to deposition of calcium phosphates. By person at risk , or person in need of such treatment , as used herein is meant any human or lower animal which suffers a significant risk of abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism if left untreated, and any human or lower animal diagnosed as being afflicted with abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism.For example, postmenopausal women persons undergoing certain steroid therapy persons on certain anti convulsant drugs persons diagnosed as having Pagets disease, hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia of malignancy, or osteolytic bone metastases persons diagnosed as suffering from one or more of the various forms of osteoporosis persons belonging to a population group known to have a significantly higher than average chance of developing osteoporosis, e.g., postmenopausal women, men over age 65, and persons being treated with drugs known to cause osteoporosis as a side effect persons diagnosed as suffering from myositis ossificans progressiva or calcinosis universalis and persons afflicted with arthritis, neuritis, bursitis, tendonitis and other inflammatory conditions which predispose involved tissue to diposition of calcium phosphate. By human or lower animal afflicted with or at risk to osteoporosis as used herein is meant a subject diagnosed as suffering from one or more of the various forms of osteoporosis, or a subject belonging to a group known to have a significantly higher than average chance of developing osteoporosis, e.g., postmenopausal women, men over the age of 65, and persons being treated with drugs known to cause osteoporosis as a side effect such as adrenocorticoid . By safe and effective amount as used herein is meant an amount of a compound or composition high enough to significantly positively modify the condition to be treated, but low enough to avoid serious side effects at a reasonable benefit risk ratio , within the scope of sound medical judgment. The safe and effective amount of diphosphonates will vary with the particular condition being treated, the age and physical condition of the patient being treated, the severity of the condition, the duration of treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy, and the specific diphosphonate employed. However, single dosages can range from about 0.001 mg P to about 3500 mg P, or from about 0.1 micrograms P kg of body weight to about 500 mg P kg of body weight.Preferred single dosages are from about 0.1 mg P to about 600 mgP, or from about 0.01 to about 50 mg P kg of body weight. Up to about four single dosages per day may be administered. Daily dosages greater than about 2000 mg P kg are not required to produce the desired effect and may produce undesirable side effects. The higher dosages within this range are, of course, required in the case of oral administration because of limited absorption. Schenk Model The compounds were evaluated for in vivo bone resorption inhibition and mineralization inhibition in an animal model system known in the field of bone metabolism as the Schenk Model. The general principles of this model system are disclosed in Shinoda et al., Calcif. Tissue Int., 35, 87 99 1983 and in Schenk et al. Calcif. Tissue Res. 11, 196 214 1973 , the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Materials and Methods Animals Preweaning 17 day old 30 gms male Sprague Dawley rats Charles River Breeding Laboratories were shipped with their mothers and placed in plastic cages with their mothers upon arrival. At 21 days of age, pups receiving Rat Chow and water ad libitum were randomly allocated into treatment groups comprising five animals per group, except for control animals receiving saline vehicle which had 10 rats per group. On day 0 and again on day 1 all animals were given a subcutaneous injection of Calcein Sigma as a 1 solution in 0.9 NaCI solution to label the skeleton. Dose Solutions and Dosing Procedure All solutions were prepared for subcutaneous injection in 0.9 normal saline and adjusted to pH 7.4 using NaOH and or HCI. Dose solution calculation was made by considering the mass of powder based on molecular weight, hydration of the active material in mg kg body weight that corresponds to mgP kg.Concentrations were based on dosing 0.2 ml 100 g body weight.Initially, all compounds were administered at 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mgP kg day for 7 days. Compounds showing activity at 0.1 mgP kg day were then tested at logarithmic decrements down to 0.001 mg P kg day. Adjustments in dosage based on changes in body weight were made on a daily basis. Necropsy, Tissue Processing and Histomorphometry On day 8 after the start of dosing, all animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation. Tibias were dissected free and placed in 70 ethyl alcohol. One tibia was dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions and embedded in methyl methacrylate using a rapid procedure described in Boyce et al., Lab. Investig., 48, 683 689 1983 , the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The tibia was sectioned longitudinally through the R metaphyseal area Leitz saw microtome at 150 jt . Specimens were stained on one surface with silver nitrate and mounted on microscope slides for evaluation with a Quantimet Image Analyzer Cambridge Instruments, Inc. using both incandescent and ultraviolet illumination. Metaphyseal trabecular bone content was measured in the region between the fluorescent label and the growth plate expressed as percent of total area bone marrow . Epiphyseal growth plate width was obtained as the mean value of 10 equally spaced measurements across the section. Statistical evaluation of data was made using parametric and non parametric analysis of variance and Wilcoxons rank sum test to determine a statistically significant effect compared to control animals. The Schenk model provided data for in vivo bone resorption inhibition by the compounds.

The general principles of this model system are disclosed in Russell et al., Calcif.Tissue Research, 6, 183 196 1970 , and in Muhlbauer andFleisch, Mineral Electrolyte Metal., 5, 296 303 1981 , the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The basic biochemical concept of the TPTX system is inhibition of the parathyroid hormone PTH induced rise in serum and ionized calcium levels by the respective bone active polyphosphonates. Materials and Methods Materials Low calcium and low phosphorous diets used were prepared R by TekladR Test Diets Harlan Industries, Madison, Wisconsin 53711 Order TD82195 in a pellet form of approximately 0.18 calcium and 0.22 phosphorous. The diets contained all the essential vitamins and minerals required for the rat, with the exception of calcium and phosphorous. The calcium and phosphorous levels of the pellets were verified analytically Procter s Gamble Co., Miami Valley Laboratories, Cincinnati, Ohio . PTH was acquired as a powdered bovine extract SigmaChemical Co., P. O. Box 14508, St. Louis, Missouri, order P 0892, Lot num 72F 9650 at an activity of 138 USP units per mg.PTH was prepared in 0.98 saline such that the final concentration was 100 U.S.P. ml. All solutions were filtered through a 4Whatman Filter Paper and refiltered through a 0.45 pm Metricel R filter. Dose Solutions and Dosing Procedure All solutions of compounds to be tested for bone resorption inhibition potency were prepared for subcutaneous injection in 0.9 normal saline and adjusted to pH 7.4 using NaOH and or HCI. Dose solution calculation was made by considering the mass of powder based on molecular weight, hydration of the active material in mg kg body weight that corresponds to mg P kg.Concentrations were based on dosing 0.2 ml 100 grams of body weight. Initially, all compounds were administered at 0.01, 0,1, and 1.0 mg P kg day for 4 days. Where necessary the test was repeated, whereby the animals were administered with 0.5 LED In order to refine the determination of LED. Adjustments in dosage based on changes in body weight were made on a daily basis. Animals in this study 50 male Wistar rats weighing approximately 150 160 grams were thyroparathyroidectomized surgically by the breeder Charles River Breeding Laboratories . All rats were double housed on arrival in suspended cages with Purina Laboratory Rodent Chows and tap water ad libitum. After acclimation to the laboratory environment for 3 5 days, the rats were placed on a low calcium, low phosphorous 0.18 0.22 diet TekladR and given 2 W V calcium gluconate supplemented deionized water via water bottles. Method On day four of low calcium diet all rats were anesthetized with KetasetR Ketamine Hydrochloride, 100 mg mi, BristolMyers , 0.10 ml 100 grams of body weight, weighed and then bled from the retro orbitai venous plexus for serum total calcium analysis using Flame Atomic Absorption FAA . All rats weighing less than 180 grams were eliminated from the study. Animals were then randomized statistically such that the mean total serum calcium for each group was the same. Only rats deemed hypocalcemic total serum calcium 48.0 mg dl were placed in study groups comprising six animals per group. Treatments with the various experimental compounds commenced on day 6 and lasted through day 9 of the study at 1 00P.M. each day . Dose solutions were prepared to be given at a constant rate of 0.2 ml 100 grams of body weight subcutaneously in the ventral skin flap where the hind leg meets the torso. All rats were weighed and dosed daily. A 25 gauge 5 8 needle was used to administer drug, alternating dose sites daily. On day 8, animals were changed to deionized, distilled water via water bottles. On day 9 all rats were fasted in the afternoon at approximately 4 00 P.M. On day 10 of study no treatment was given. In the morning a 600 ,ul sample of whole blood was collected from each rat in Microtainer B D15060 serum separater tubes for serum total calcium FAA .Two 125 jl samples of heparinized whole blood were also collected to be used for ionized calcium analysis. Immediately following blood collection all rats were weighed and injected with bovine parathyroid hormone subcutaneously at a rate of 75 USP filtered per 100 grams of body weight. Blood sampling for total and ionized calcium was repeated three and one half hours post PTH injection. All pre and post PTH total and ionized calciums were statistically analyzed for significance compared to PTH alone control using Students t test, analysis of variance, and their nonparametric equivalents. The post minus pre change and 96 change were also determined on calcium levels and pre drug vs post drug body weights. The physiological effect of the PTH challenge is a rise in serum calcium level, with peak activity observed at three and one half hours. Since the hormonal and dietary controls of calcium metabolism are minimized in the TPTX model, an observed increase in serum calcium level is presumably the result of resorption of bone material. Since polyphosphonates tend to inhibit resorption of bone materials, the animals pretreated with polyphosphonate showed a rise in serum calcium level after PTH challenge which was less than that found in control animals which had been treated with saline vehicle instead. The lowest dose at which the polyphosphonate is capable of inhibiting bone resorption, as evidenced by a decreased rise in serum calcium upon PTH challenge, is a measure of the bone resorption inhibition potency of the polyphosphonate.The LED values of the bone resorption inhibition potency of representative compounds as determined by the TPTX rat model are presented in Table Ill.
