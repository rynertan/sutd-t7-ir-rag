# Tunable oscillator circuit.

## Abstract
The circuit is provided with a pair of oscillator transistors T1, T1 whose bases are crosscoupled to the opposite collectors, and provided with a capacitance C which is arranged between the emitters of the oscillator transistors T1, T2 , each emitter being AC connected via an emitter current source 1, 2 to a reference voltage. In order to considerably increase the tuning range without being limited in the choice of the output amplitude, a pair of buffer transistors T3, T4 in common base configuration is added whose two collectors are connected via a pair of collector resistors R
