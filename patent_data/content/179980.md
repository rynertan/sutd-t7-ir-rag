# Method of forming alignment marks in a semiconductor body.

## Abstract
A laser beam 20 is used to scribe an alignment mark 26 on the back side 16 of a lightly doped substrate 24 of a silicon wafer 12 containing an heavily doped internal layer 22 . The wavelength of the laser beam is chosen such that it passes through the lightly doped substrate without absorption but is absorbed in the heavily doped internal layer to produce therein a defect 29 which has the same position as the scribed alignment mark. Subsequent heating of the wafer causes the defect to migrate upwardly through a lightly doped epitaxial layer 30 to the front side of the wafer and produce therein a visible mirror image of the scribed alignment mark.
