# A method of measuring impedances, particularly low capacitances, by using one or more references.

## Abstract
A method of measuring impedances, particularly low capacitances, in which method such measuring electronics is used which comprises one or more reference impedances, whose electrical ratings fall upon the measuring range. These refrence impedances are connected to a measuring circuit alternately with the impedance or impedances to be measured by a switch arrangement. In order to take into account the individual non linearities of the impedance sensor s C The input signal D The impedance sensor is used for measuring a changing physical quantity such as temperature, pressure, humidity, displacement, force and or various types of radiation.
