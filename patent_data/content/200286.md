# CONTROL OF BLOOD FLOW

## Abstract
A blood flow control system comprising a primary arteriovenous fistula 11 having a secondary fistula 14 leading to a venous sink 13 and blood flow control means 15 engaged with the primary fistula 11 between the secondary fistula and the vein whereby restriction of the blood flow through the primary fistula 11 by the blood flow control means increases the flow of blood to the venous sink 11 . An implantable device for controlling the flow of blood through a primary arteriovenous fistual 11 so as to control the flow of blood to a venous sink 13 through a secondary fistula 14 connected to the primary fistula 11 , a comprising inflatable pressure means 50 adapted to engage the primary fistula 11 between the secondary fistula 14 and therein, pump means in communication with the pressure means 50 adapted to inflate the pressure means whereby the pressure means restricts the flow of blood through the primary fistula 11 and means for deflating the pressure means.
