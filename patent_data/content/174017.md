# Improvements relating to capacitive devices for measuring the diameter of a dielectric fibre.

## Abstract
The improvements relating to capacitive devices for measuring the diameter of a dielectric fibre are based on a particular shaping of the capacitor plates, such as to allow electric field reductions at the edges to be compensated for and hence capacitance measurements to be unaffected by fibre vibrations.
