# A process for preparing polyurethane foams, and the prepared foams.

## Abstract
Polyurethane foams are prepared by reacting an active hydrogen containing organic compound with an organic polyisocyanate in the presence of a blowing agent and an amylaceous material which has been stabilized either a by treating with a stabilizing agent containing an effective amount of an antioxidant capable of inhibiting the formation of oxidation products in the amylaceous material upon exposure to an oxidizing atmosphere or b by removing substantially all, or at least a major portion, of the oxidizable materials, particularly fatty acids or fats, from the amylaceous material.
