# Acrylic resin having pendant silane groups thereon, and methods of making and using the same.

## Abstract
What are disclosed are a poly meth acrylate polymer having pendant hydrolyzable alkoxysilane groups thereon prepared by reacting a poly meth acrylate polymer having pendant hydroxy groups thereon with an isocyanato func tional alkoxysilane having 1 to 3 hydrolyzable lower alkoxy groups present on the silicon atom thereof a substrate such as glass or aluminium having a tenacious coating thereon of such a polymer alone or in admixture with another, different, resinous binder component such a substrate further having a resinous sealant composition applied over said tenacious coating as a primer and methods for making such a polymer and such coated substrates.
