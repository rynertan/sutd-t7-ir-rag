# Optical fiber communication with Frequency Division Multiplexing.

## Abstract
A system is disclosed for providing multi channel transmission of digital and broadband video information in optical fiber communication for local area networks through frequency division multiplexing. A plurality of closely spaced optical carrier wave pairs 90 100 is generated with the optical carrier waves within each optical carrier wave pair having a predetermined separation frequency between one another. Each of the plurality of optical carrier wave pairs is assigned to a predetermined frequency slot and optically combining the plurality of optical carrier wave pairs to provide a multiplexed optical output wave. Advantageously, in addition to direct detection the plurality of optical carrier wave pairs 90 100 may be detected by opto electronic heterodyne detection and or incoherent optical heterodyne detection to electronically recover the optical carrier wave pairs.
