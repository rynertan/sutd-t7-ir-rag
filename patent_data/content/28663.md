## Description
This invention relates to keyswitches and more particularly to keyswitches exhibiting a variable capacitance. Keyswitches are used in a wide variety of applications in the prior art, such as control circuits, keyboards for typewriters, calculators, computers and the like. The switches generally are classified according to the phenomenon relied upon to indicate activations resistive, inductive, magnetic or capacitive. Although capacitive keyswitches known in the prior art are somewhat simple in construction and immune to many of the problems of the contact and inductive switches, capacitive keyswitches of the prior art do not generally have a large variation one order of magnitude or greater in capacitance upon actuation. Furthermore, the capacitance type keyswitches of the prior art are particularly susceptible to environmental contamination from small particles such as eraser particles, lint and liquid spillage. Also, the capacitive keyswitches of the prior art generally have a low hysteresis and are quite sensitive to small changes in movement of the switch plunger. One of the principal objects of this invention is to provide a reliable capacitive keyswitch that is self cleaning and exhibits a linear capacitance change of a substantial magnitude. An additional object is to provide such a capacitive keyswitch that additionally has a substantial capacitance hysteresis to enable the threshold values to be adjusted depending on the desired application. A further object of this invention is to provide a new capacitive keyswitch that, in addition to the other advantages, has sufficient economy of space to easily accomodate lamps and tactile feel features. These and other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent upon reading the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment. Only the claims at the conclusion of the specification are intended to limit the scope of this invention. A preferred and alternate embodiment of this invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which Fig.l is an expanded isometric view of a keyswitch illustrating the various components of a preferred embodiment of the present invention Fig.2 is a vertical cross section view showing the keyswitch mounted on a keyswitch panel with a plunger in the undepressed position Fig. 3 is a plan view of a flexible capacitance plate of a preferred embodiment of the invention Fig.4 is an enlarged fragmentary view of a portion of the switch illustrated inFig.2 taken along line 3 3 in Fig.2 showing the switch in solid line in an undepressed position and in dotted line in a depressed position and Fig.5 illustrates a vertical cross sectional view of an alternate embodiment of the keyswitch in which the keyswitch is utilized in conjunction with a printed circuit board in which portions of the keyswitch are mounted on the printed circuit board. A preferred and alternate embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the attached drawings in which the pushbutton switch or keyswitch is generally designated with the numeral 10. The keyswitch 10 is intended to be connected to an electrical circuit that senses capacitance change between two switch positions. The keyswitch 10 includes a housing 12 having a housing top 13 that is mounted in a keyboard panel, switch panel or mounting plate 14 Fig.2,4,5 depending upon the particular application of the switch 10. In the alternate embodiment illustrated in Fig e 5, the keyswitch 10 is used in conjunction with a printed circuit board 16 in which major components of the keyswitch are mounted on the printed circuit board 16 itself. The embodiment illustrated in Figs.1 4 shows a unitary housing 12 that is supported on mounting plate 14. The housing 12 has a switch cavity 18 formed therein. The keyswitch 10 has a switch actuating means generally designated with the numeral 20 which preferably includes a reciprocating plunger 21 that is mounted for movement along a plunger axis between a released or undepressed position Fig.2 and a depressed or actuated position illustrated in dotted lines in Fig.4. The plunger 21 is elongated having an internal hollow cavity 23 that extends from an upper end 24 to a lower end 26. Preferably the plunger has a rectangular cross section and fits within a rectangular guide surface in the housing 12. The lower end 26 of the plunger 21 has a periphery 28 that is preferably rectangular. The keyswitch has a biasing means 30 for biasing the plunger to the released or undepressed position illustrated in solid line in Figs.1 5. Various types of biasing means may be utilized. A coil spring is illustrated as one possible means. It should be noted that the interior of the switch cavity 18 and the lower portion of the plunger 21 are quite spacious and unobstructed and thus can accomodate various types of tactile feel systems and or lamp or illumination features.At upper end 24 of the plunger, a push button or keytop 32 is provided to assist in the manual actuation of the switch. One of the principal features of the illustrated preferred and alternate embodiment includes stationary, rigid capacitance plates 34 and 36. In the preferred embodiment, the rigid capacitance plates 34 and 36 are mounted against a wall of the switch cavity 18. The plates 34 and 36 are mounted in an upright orientation substantially parallel with the plunger axis. The plates 34 and 36 are mounted in close proximity to the path of the plunger without interfering with the movement of the plunger. The plates 34 and 36 are separated by a capacitance gap 38. In a preferred embodiment the gap 38 is important to defining the capacitance value between the two plates 34 and 36 when the switch is in the released up or depressed position. Each of the plates 34 and 36 are preferably of a rigid structure and include a planar face surface 41 that is substantially parallel with the plunger axis. The plates 34 and 36 preferably have an upper inclined edge 43 Fig.5 . The plates 34 and 36 have terminals 45 for use in conveniently connecting the plates to an electrical circuit. In a preferred embodiment, the electrical circuit is operatively connected to the plates 34 and 36 to measure or sense the capacitance therebetween. An additional important feature of the illustrated preferred and alternate embodiment is a flexible capacitance plate 50 that is utilized to capacitively couple the plates 34 and 36 together and to bridge the gap 38 to cause a substantial change in the capacitance as measured by the electrical circuit. The flexible capacitance plate 50 is preferably formed of a thin sheet material that may be readily deformed when engaged by the plates 34 and 36. The flexible capacitance plate 50,in the illustrated preferred and alternate embodiment has a mounting portion 52 Fig.3 that is utilized for securing the plate 50 to the plunger end 24. The plate 50 includes a bending portion 54 that initially extends radially outward beyond the periphery 28 of the plunger 21. The bending portion 54 extends integrally into contact portions 56 that extend outward in a cantilevered manner from the plunger for engaging and slidably functionally wiping the planar face surfaces 41 of the plates 34 and 36. The flexible capacitive plate 50 is sufficiently flexible to enable the bending portions 54 to readily bend to cause the contact portions 56 to conform to the contour and orientation of the planar surfaces 41. The natural resilience of the sheet material biases the contact portions 56 outward to form an intimate frictional contact with the planar surfaces 41. In a preferred. embodiment as illustrated in Fig.3, the capacitive plate 50 has a central mounting aperture 58 formed therein.Keyswitch 10 has a mounting means 60 with a flanged insert portion 61 to enable the mounting means to be press fit into the lower end 26 to secure the plate 50 to the plunger 21. In the preferred embodiment, the plates 34 and 36 are formed into a square or rectangular configuration with the plates 34 and 36 being substantially perpendicular to each other across the gap 38. The plate 50 is formed in the shape of a four leaf clover with four contact portions 56 projecting outward at 900 intervals about the axis. The flexible capacitance plate 50 is constructed from a thin sheet of metalized dielectric material having a thickness less than 0.06 milimeters and preferably having a thickness less than 0.03 milimeters. Satisfactorily commercially available metalized dielectric material includes aluminized Mylar. The flexible capacitance plate preferably includes a flexible dielectric plastic backing having a metalized layer of a few thousandAngstroms deposited thereon. In a preferred embodiment, the capacitance plates 34 and 36 are formed of a highly electrically conductive material such as aluminum or copper. In an alternate embodiment the plates 34 and 36 may be coated with a thin dielectric material with the flexible capacitance plate 50 being formed of a thin metal foil. The term capacitance plate is used broadly and may include a separate metal plate or layer or it may include a metal plate that is coated with a dielectric layer or a metal layer on a dielectric backing as long as the plates when in contact with each other have a dielectric layer separating the metal layers. In an alternate embodiment, the stationary plates 34 and 36 may be formed of a flexible sheet material with plates 50 and 34,36 deforming in a sliding frictional arrangement to each other s contours. Furthermore, in an alternate embodiment, the location of plates 34,36 and plate 50 may be reversed with the plates 34 and 36 being mounted on the plunger and the flexible plate 50 being stationarily positioned in the path of a rigid plate 34,36. Furthermore, in alternate embodiments, the stationary plates 34 and 36 may be elevated so that the flexible capacitance plate 50 engages the plates 34 and 36 when the plunger is in the released or depressed position with the plunger moving the flexible capacitance plate 50 downward away from the plates 34 and 36 when the plunger is depressed.The important aspect is to obtain a substantial change in the capacitance as sensed by the electrical circuit when the plunger moves from one position to the other position It should be noted that the arrangement is selfcleaning with the flexible capacitance plate 50 frictionally sliding over the surfaces 41 of the capacitance plates 34,36 to wipe the surfaces to remove any particle or contaminations therefrom. Furthermore, the capacitance as measured by the electrical circuit changes substantially linear with the movement of the plunger. In experimental models, capacitance changes of greater than seven to one have been obtained. Furthermore, because of the linear nature of the changing capacitance, the circuit provides for a substantial hysteresis in which the threshold points may be easily adjusted to eliminate the problem of ripple movement or teasing of the plunger.Furthermore, it should be appreciated that a very intimate contact is produced between the flexible capacitance plate 50 and the rigid capacitance plates 34,36 because of their sliding frictional contact and the natural resilient pressure of the flexible material against the rigid plates during the wiping action. Furthermore, the alignment tolerances of the plunger with respect to the stationary rigid capacitance plates 34,36 may be quite large because of the substantially selfcentering or aligning capability of the flexible capacitance plate 50 as it moves over the stationary rigid capacitance plates 34 and 36. The flexible capacitance plate 50 in essence is biased outwardly to provide a pressure against the stationary plates 34 and 36. All of these features provide for a keyswitch that is economical to manufacture, capable of operating in contaminate environments and having usually good electrical characteristics. It should be understood that the above described embodiments are simply illustrative of the principles of this invention and numerous other embodiments may be readily devised without deviating therefrom. Therefore, only the following claims are intended to define the scope of this invention.
