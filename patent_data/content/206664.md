# GUARD SYSTEM

## Abstract
Guard system for protecting some space against un detected intrusion uses a plurality of wave beam paths from transmitter T1 Tn to receivers R1 Rn selectively energised in cycles multiplexer Tx Mx so that each beam transmitters T1 Tn is energised for part only of each cycle. Pressure or absence of beam energy indicative of intrusion is monitored receivers R1 Rn and multiplexer Rx Mx . Signal level discrimination 46 of received signals operates both logic circuitry flipflop 55 to give effectively continuous output 56, 58 except for beam interruption 52 even through a quiescent state of each cycle, and fault indication logic cir cuitry 100 via 70, 72 that is shown duplicated.
