# Rubber modified nylon composition.

## Abstract
A polyamide composition of improved impact compris ing a blend of components A 20 to 79.5 weight percent of a graft rubber composition of a graft polymer of methyl meth acrylate and or meth acrylonitrile and a vinylaromatic monomer grafted onto a substrate rubber, B 94.5 to 20 weight percent of a polyamide resin, and C 1 to 60 weight percent of a polymer compatibilizer which contains from ab out 0.05 to 4.0 mole percent of a comonomer containing a functional group which reacts with the polyamide resin.
