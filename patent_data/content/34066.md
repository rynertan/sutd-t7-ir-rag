# PRINTER WITH FORMS OVERLAY

## Abstract
A printer with provision for forms overlay avoids the need for mechanical synchronization of the print drum and forms drum. The print drum 17 carries means 62, 64, 66 for generating a top of page signal which initiates printing of a page, and alignment means 68,70 is provided in associa tion with the forms drum indicating that that drum is in a predertermined position. A circuit 50 controls a motor 18 driving the forms drum 16 so as to cause rotation of the drum to start in response to the top of page signal and to stop in response to the alignment signal. The motor 18 may be a stepper motor driven by timing controlled by a gate 89 enabled by the output of a flip flop 90 which is set by the top of page signal and reset by means 100 providing an adjustable interval after the alignment signal. The timing signals may be adjustable in frequency, being generated, for example, by causing a clock circuit 82, 83 to repeatedly fill a counter 85, 86, 87 , means 88 being provided for initially loading the counter with a preset count.
