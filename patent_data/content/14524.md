# Olefine polymerisation catalyst and the production and use thereof.

## Abstract
A component of a polymerisation catalyst is prepared by reacting an organo magnesium halide with a solid, inorganic oxide, then reacting the product with a Lewis Base compound, particularly as ester and finally with titanium tetrachloride. After reacting the organo magnesium halide with the inor ganic oxide it may be treated with a halogenating agent before it is reacted with the Lewis Base compound. The pro duct obtained is combined with an organo aluminium com pound preferably together with a Lewis Base and used to polymerise an olefine monomer particularly propylene or mixtures of ethylene and a I olefine containing at least 4 car bon atoms. The catalyst system has a high activity, is stereos pecific and has a lower proportion of halogen than some other catalyst systems.
