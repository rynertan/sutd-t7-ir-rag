# Hydrothermal process for synthesizing crystalline powders.

## Abstract
Berlinite crystalline powder of uniform particle size and high purity is prepared by repeated thermal cycling to react a mixture of aluminum hydroxide or aluminum oxide and an excess of concentrated phosphoric acid in a sealed pressure vessel. The vessel is preferably held in a horizontal orienta tion and rotated about a longitudinal axis during the reaction. The product powder is useful in growing large single crystals that have surface acoustic wave applications. Crystalline powder of alpha gallium orthophosphate may be prepared using the same apparatus and a similar procedure.
