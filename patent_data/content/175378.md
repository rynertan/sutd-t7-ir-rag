## Description
The present invention relates to dynamic random access memory hereafter DRAM devices. Random access memory RAM devices made using metaloxide transistor MOS technology have been used widely in storage apparatuses of electronic devices such as computers. For RAM devices, there have been used two different techniques for storing information namely there have been provided static MOS RAMs and dynamic MOS RAMs. A static MOS memory RAM usually has a relatively high speed of operation and a rather higher power dissipation as compared with a dynamic memory circuit RAM . On the other hand, a dynamic MOS RAM DRAM need occupy less area on a substrate, being suitable for achieving high packing density, and has lesser power consumption, although its speed of operation is rather lower and more elaborate control circuits are required in comparison with a static RAM. DRAMs are increasingly used as storage devices of high capacity for electronic devices. A great deal of effort has been made towards increasing the high packing density of DRAMS, resulting in reduction of the number of transistors per DRAM memory cell. Ultimately, a DRAM cell having only a single transistor has been developed and widely used. Such a one transistor memory cell requires only two control lines, a bit line and a word line. However, it requires a sensitive sense amplifier, because an output signal of the cell is read out as a potential differential of the associated bit line provided by a stored charge in a capacitor of the cell. When the cell is read out, a greater part of the electrical charge stored in the cell is consumed to charge up the parasitic capacity of the bit line, which means that only a small potential differential can be attained namely a very faint output signal. Moreover, there is a tendency for the capacity of such a memory cell to be decreased, and for the parasitic capacity of the relevant data bit line to remain almost unchanged, as the packing density of the DRAM is increased. Thus, high sensitivity is increasingly required for the associated sense amplifier, causing cost increase and reduction of packing density of a DRAM device. There have been proposed other types of DRAM cells, intended to overcome the above described disadvantages of a one transistor cell. A three transistor cell is one DRAM cell type recently proposed. Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of a previously proposed three transistor memory cell, having a shared read write R W data bit line DL. The cell also has a read select line RL and a separate write select line WL. In a cell of this type, information is stored as the potential level of the gate of a storage transistor T₃, which is generated in dependence upon stored charges in the gate electrode, and the stored information is output by making a read select transistor T₁ conductive, for example so as to discharge the data bit line DL to ground potential when the storage transistor T₃ is also conductive. Thus, an output signal potential differential the difference between the voltage levels of the data bit line DL for different stored information values can be substantially greater than the output signal potential differential available with a one transistor cell. Thus, a simple sense amplifier is sufficient to detect the output signal, which means that the sense amplifier region can be reduced in size, providing a higher packing density in this respect. However, with a three transistor cell, the numbers of transistors and lines used for a cell are larger than those used for a one transistor cell. When these elements and lines are arranged in a plane, the cell occupies a relatively large area, adversely affecting the packing density of a device using such cells. EP A 0 147 151, published on 03.07.85, claiming priority from Japanese Patent Application JP 237776 83 dated 19.12.83, discloses a three transistor dynamic random access memory which has a structure in which a write address transistor is stacked on a read address transistor. US A 4 084 108 discloses Fig. 3B what appears to be a form of dual gate MOS transistor. US A 3 868 654 discloses the use of a common read write select line with transistors of different threshold voltages. According to the present invention there is provided a three transistor cell for a dynamic random access memory formed on a semiconductor substrate, the cell comprising An embodiment of the present invention can provide a three transistor cell for a DRAM having a structure enabling a higher packaging density to be achieved for the DRAM device. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a three transistor cell for a DRAM with a two storied structure wherein an arrangement of elements and associated control lines of the cell is provided which is effective to reduce the area of the cell. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a configuration for a three transistor cell of a DRAM device which enables a reduction of the number of control lines from three to two not including a ground line . An embodiment of the present invention provides a structure for a cell of a DRAM device wherein electrical elements are arranged in a two storied configuration such that a high packing density can be realized. Embodiments of the present invention provide such two storied structures of three transistor cells of DRAMS whereby the cells have either three or two driving lines besides a ground line. In the above description of the previously proposed three transistor memory cell shown in Fig. 1, it should be noted that transistor T₁ and transistor T₃ are both conductive when reading a stored signal O , passing a current through the T₁ T₃ circuit between data bit line DL and ground line GND, but that transistor T₁ is conductive and transistor T₃ is non conductive when a stored signal 1 is read and in this case no current flows through the T₁ T₃ circuit. The inventor has appreciated that a dual gate field effect transistor can be applied in the cell of Fig. 1, by which the connection between transistor T₁ and transistor T₃ through respective source drain regions can be omitted, serving to effect an economy as regards space on the relevant substrate of a DRAM device. This is applied in some embodiments of the present invention. For saving area on a substrate of a semiconductor device, two storied or two level structures have been utilized, wherein electronic elements are arranged in two layers separated from one another by an insulator layer. In an embodiment of the present invention, a read select transistor T₁, a storage transistor T₃, and a read select line RL which acts as a gate electrode of transistor T₁ are formed directly on the surface of a silicon substrate, i.e. on a first storey or level, whilst a write select transistor T₂ and a write word select line WL which acts as a gate of transistor T₂ are formed on a second storey, on an insulator layer separating the first and second stories. A data bit line DL is formed on a phospho silicate glass layer covering the entire substrate. In a DRAM memory cell in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the arrangement of the transistors is such that the write select transistor T₂ overlies the read select transistor T₁, and a common channel region is formed partially overlaid by the gates of read select transistor T₁ and storage transistor T₃. Thus the transistors T₁ and T₃ act like a dual gate transistor. As a result, in respect of the connecting portion between the two transistors, usually including at least source drain regions, a remarkable saving is made. In addition, due to the overlying structure of transistor T₂ on transistor T₁ and the circuit configuration of the cell, one of the source drain regions of transistor T₂ is utilized also as the gate electrode of transistor T₃, serving to save space on the substrate. Furthermore, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a circuit configuration of a DRAM cell is provided wherein the number of control lines of a memory cell is reduced from three to two namely, a shared write read bit line and a shared write read select line, and two cell transistors having different threshold voltages from each other are used. A DRAM cell having a further simplified two storied structure is provided in accordance with the circuit configuration of the cell. Reference is made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring to Figs. 2 a to 2 c , there is shown a memory cell in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 2 a is a circuit diagram of a memory cell of a DRAM having three transistors and three control lines, whose configuration is quite similar to that of a previously proposed three transistor cell as shown in Fig. 1, except in relation to reference signs or indications Ch1, Ch3 denoting channel regions and in relation to reference signs or indications 3a, 3b, 9a and 9b denoting source drain regions of respective transistors. These indications respectively correspond to those illustrated in the plan view of Fig. 2 b and the cross sectional view of Fig. 2 c . On a p type silicon substrate 1, field oxide layers 2, shown in the plan view of Fig. 2 b by hatching, are formed defining transistor regions and ground lines therebetween. In the substrate 1, a n type drain region 3a and a n type source region 3b are formed, having a channel region Ch1 plus Ch3 therebetween. A MOS transistor T₁, namely a read select transistor, comprises the drain region 3a, channel region Ch1, channel region Ch3 as its source region, a channel gate insulator layer 4 of silicon dioxide Si0₂ approximately 300 Å 1Å 0.1 nm thick formed over the channel region Ch1, and a gate electrode 5 made of tungsten silicide WSi₂ or polycrystalline silicon, for instance. The gate electrode 5 of transistor T₁ is covered by an insulator layer 6 of Si0₂ having a thickness of approximately 6000 Å, over which a write select transistor T₂ is formed. The write select transistor T₂ overlaid on the read select transistor T₁ comprises a first diffusion region 9a of n type drain region , a second diffusion region 9b of n type source region , a gate insulator 10 of Si0₂ having a thickness of approximately 300 Å, a channel region Ch2 or 8 and a gate electrode 11. The silicon layer 8 of p type has a thickness of 5000 to 8000 Å, being formed using a silicon on insulator SOI technology. The first diffusion region 9a and the second diffusion region 9b are formed in the silicon layer 8. The region 9a reaches an insulator layer 7 of Si0₂ having a thickness of approximately 300 Å and is connected to the drain region 3a of read select transistor T₁ through a contact window 13a Fig. 2 c , see also 13 in Fig. 2 b . A storage transistor T₃ comprises the source region 3b, a drain region Ch1 which is used commonly with the read select transistor T₁, the insulator layer 7 as gate insulator , the channel region Ch3, and a gate electrode 9b which is commonly used as the source region of the write select transistor T₂. Thus, the combined device comprising the read select transistor T₁ and the storage transistor T₃ can be regarded as a dual gate field effect transistor, comprising a drain region 3a, a source region 3b, a channel region Ch1 plus Ch3, two gate insulators 4,7 and two gate electrodes 5,9b. In addition, by overlaying the write select transistor T₂ over the read select transistor T₁, one of the source region and the drain region of the transistor T₂ is commonly used as the gate electrode of the storage transistor T₃. These two factors serve to increase substantially the packing density of the cell. The gate electrode 5 of the read select transistor T₁ and the gate electrode 11 of the write select transistor T₂ are extended in a Y direction indicated by an arrow marked Y in Fig. 2 b to play the rôles of a read select line RL and a word select line WL respectively. A phospho silicate glass layer 12 is formed to cover the transistors and lines of the device, and a data bit line DL 14 of aluminium is formed thereon in a direction perpendicular to the Y direction, being connected to the drain regions 9a and 3a through a contact hole 13b Fig. 2 c , see also 13 in Fig. 2 b opened in the phosphosilicate glass layer 12. The source region 3b is extended to serve as a ground line GND as shown in the plan view of Fig. 2 b . Thus the circuit configuration shown in Fig. 2 a is realized. To write a logical O into the cell, the data bit line DL is maintained at a high level and the write select line WL, namely the gate electrode 11 of the write select transistor T₂, is brought to a higher voltage level to make the write select transistor T₂ ON , bringing the gate electrode 9b of the storage transistor T₃ to high level to keep the transistor T₃ in ON state. Thereafter, the write select transistor T₂ is made OFF to keep the voltage level of the gate electrode 9b of the storage transistor T₃ high, storing the logical O . When reading a stored logical O from the cell, the data bit line DL is brought to a predetermined voltage level such as an intermediate voltage Vm level between high level and low level and kept floating. Thereafter, the read select transistor T₁ is made ON . Since the storage transistor T₃ is in an ON state, a current flows from the data bit line DL to the ground line GND through the read select transistor T₁ and the storage transistor T₃ substantially pulling down the voltage of the data bit line DL to the ground voltage. The reduction of the voltage of the data bit line DL represents the logical O . For writing a logical l into the cell, the data bit line DL is maintained at a low voltage level, and simultaneously the write select transistor T₂ is made ON , making the voltage level of the gate of the storage transistor T₃ low. Then, the write select transistor T₂ is made OFF thereafter, maintaining the gate voltage level of the storage transistor T₃ low, namely, maintaining the storage transistor T₃ in OFF state. When reading out the logical l from the cell, the data bit line DL is maintained at the voltage level Vm, for instance, and the read select transistor T₁ is made ON . Since the storage transistor T₃ is OFF state, no current flows through the circuit storage transistor T₃ plus read select transistor T₁, maintaining the voltage of the data bit line DL at Vm, providing no voltage difference no pull down of the data bit line voltage which represents the logical 1 . As described above, the circuitry of the first embodiment of the present invention operates in the same manner as that of a previously prepared DRAM cell. However, the storage transistor T₃ and the read select transistor T₁ co possess their channel regions Ch3 and Ch1, eliminating diffusion regions for connecting the two transistors. Furthermore, one of the source drain regions of the write select transistor T₂ is commonly used as the gate electrode of the storage transistor T₃. As the result, a remarkable reduction in cell area can be achieved, enabling packing density to be increased significantly. In addition, the gate electrode 9b of the storage transistor T₃ wherein information is stored in the form of electrical charges, is electrically isolated from the substrate 1 by the surrounding silicon dioxide layer 6 and 7, resulting in an effect which serves for preventing soft error problems, due to alpha ray irradiation. The circuit configuration of Fig. 2 a can be illustrated in another configuration as shown in Fig. 2 d , wherein the read select transistor T₁ and the storage transistor T₃ are replaced by a dual gate electrode MOS transistor T Now, a second embodiment in accordance with the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 3 a to 3 c . The memory cell of the second embodiment has three transistors and two control lines as shown in the circuit diagram of Fig. 3 a . In comparison with the cell of Fig. 2 a , the read select line RL and write select line WL of Fig. 2 a are replaced by a single line, write read select line WRL to which the gate electrodes of a write select transistor T₂ and read select transistor T₁ are connected. Therefore, in order to distinguish these two transistors from each other, the threshold voltages of the two transistors T₁ and T₂, namely V Fig. 3 b is a partial plan view of a DRAM device, illustrating the configuration of a memory cell in accordance with the second embodiment, and Fig. 3 c is a cross sectional view of the cell taken along the line A A shown in the partial plan view of Fig. 3 b . Threshold voltages of transistors T₁, T₂ and T₃ are designated by V Taking the threshold voltage of storage transistor T₃ as V When writing an information signal e.g. 0 or 1 into the cell, T₂ is made conductive by holding the write read select line WRL at V When reading out a stored signal from the cell, the voltage of the write read select line WRL is held at V As seen particularly in Fig. 3 c , said read select transistor T₁ and said write select transistor T₂ formed over said read select transistor T₁ share a common gate electrode 15 Fig. 3 c with each other, said common gate electrode 15 being disposed between said read select transistor T₁ and said write select transistor T₂ and effective for the respective transistors through respective gate insulator layers 4, 10 . The side walls of the common gate electrode 15 are covered by insulating layers. As described above in detail, two storied structures and circuit configurations in accordance with the present invention can provide for high packing densities in associated DRAM devices. In addition, the present invention serves to provide a DRAM device with easier fabricating processes, thereby serving to reduce manufacturing costs. An example of a method of fabrication of a DRAM cell according to the first embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the partial plan view of Fig. 4 and the partial cross sectional views of Fig. 5 a to e , each taken along the line A A in Fig. 4, representing the cell at respective steps or stages in its fabrication. With reference to Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 a With reference to Fig. 5 b Thereafter, a contact window 13a is opened in the second gate insulator layer 7 over the n type drain region 3a, this being followed by the formation of a thick polycrystalline silicon layer 8 approximately 5000 Å thick over the entire surface of the substrate 1. The polycrystalline silicon layer is converted to a single crystal layer by irradiation with a laser beam or an electron beam having a predetermined energy for heating. This is one of the SOI silicon on insulator technologies and the single crystal silicon layer is referred to as an SOI layer 8 which serves to form an MOS FET having a small gate leakage current. At the next step, the SOI layer 8 is doped, to become a p type diffusion layer with 10¹⁶ cm ³ dopant density, by boron B ion implantation and subsequent heat treatment. There is an alternative method for forming the SOI layer 8 utilizing an SOI technology, namely solid phase epitaxy. A polycrystalline silicon layer formed on the entire substrate by a conventional CVD method may be converted into a layer of single crystal silicon structure by re crystallization using a heat treatment at approximately 600 C whereby the exposed single crystal structure of the contact region acts as seed for the recrystallization. Referring to Fig. 5 c Referring to Fig. 5 d Referring to Fig. 5 e As described above in detail, through all the fabricating steps of the semiconductor memory device, conventional semiconductor fabricating technologies are used, requiring no increase in the fabrication cost. A dynamic random access memory DRAM cell having three MIS transistors arranged in two storied layers having a high packing density configuration is disclosed. A write select transistor is disposed overlying a read select transistor, being electrically separated from each other through an insulator layer, and a drain region of the write select transistor is shared with the underlying read select transistor as its gate electrode. A storage transistor and the read select transistor are formed on a silicon substrate in the same level and channel regions of both transistors are connected to each other and used as a diffusion region of the opposite transistor, resulting in elimination of connecting members such as diffusion regions and a conducting path therebetween which were otherwise necessary. These two points contribute to elevate the packing density of the cell. Furthermore, a write select line and a read select line are combined into a single control line write read select line, saving one line to obtain higher packing density. In the cell, gate electrodes of both transistors are connected to the write read line. These transistors are distinguished from each other by their different threshold voltage levels from each other.
