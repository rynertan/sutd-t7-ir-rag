# A radiographic device for deriving information from over exposed film.

## Abstract
A device for recovering information from over exposed regions of image recording emulsions in general, and radiographs in particular includes a light tight housing 3, 4 the outer surface of which is covered with a layer of lead 4 , a source 1 arranged to project ionizing radiation within said housing, and a removable cassette 5 which, in use, carries the over exposed radiograph 12 in close contact with a further film 6 for recording the information. The cassette 5 has a light tight cover 8 which is displaceable to permit exposure of the further film 6 to an image produced by irradiation of the over exposed radiograph 12 by the source 1 . The method includes irradiating the over exposed radiograph, placed in close contact with a further film, by means of a device as aforesaid.
