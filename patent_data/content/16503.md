# Waveform correction circuit.

## Abstract
A waveform correction circuit having a slicer 13 and a mutual adaptation of the threshold level of the slicer and the input signal level by means of an automatic level control circuit 29, 35, 3 comprises an automatic amplitude control circuit 21, 39, 45, 51 to reduce the influence of amplitude variations in the relevant portion of the input signal on the level control as much as possible, so that a rapid and accurate adaptation of the operation of the waveform correction circuit is obtained in the case of level and amplitude variations of the input signal.
