Compounds of this invention embodied in the Formula I are very active broad spectrum herbicides and are effective in regulat ing growth of Ã…a wide variety of undesirable plants, i.e., weeds, when applied, in herbicidally effective amount, to the growth medium prior to emergence of the weeds or to the weeds subsequent to emergence from the growth medium. The term herbicidally effective amount is that amount of compound or mixture of com pounds of this invention required to so injure or damage weeds such that the weeds are incapable of recovering following application. The quantity of compound or mixture of compounds of this invention applied in order to exhibit a satisfactory herbicidal effect may vary over a wide range and depends on a variety of factors, such as, for example, hardiness of a particular weed species, extent of tweed infestation, climatic conditions, soil conditions, method of application and the like. Typically, as little as 0.1 or less pound per acre of compound or mixture of compounds of this inven tion would be expected to provide satisfactory weed control, although in some instances application rates in excess of one pound per acre might be required. Of course, the efficacy of a particu lar compound against a particular weed species may readily be determined by routine laboratory or field testing in a manner well known to the art. A compound or compounds of this invention may, of course, be used as such or in formulation with agronomically acceptable adjuvants, inert carriers, other herbicides, or other commonly used agricultural compounds, for example, insecticides, fungicides, stabilizers, safeners, fertilizers or the like. The compounds of this invention alone or in formulation with other agronom ically used materials are typically applied in the form of dusts, granules, wettable powders, solutions, suspensions, aerosols, emulsions, dispersions or the like in a manner well nown to the art.When formulated with other typically used agronomically acceptable materials, the amount of compound or compounds of this invention may vary over a wide range, for example, from about 0.05 to about 95 per cent by weight on weight of formulation. Typical, such formulations would contain from about 5 to about 75 percent by weight of compound or compounds of this invention. A compound or compounds of this invention are effective in controlling a variety of common broadleaved and grassy weeds at application rates of only a few grams per acre either pre or postemergent. Exemplary of weeds that may be effectively con trolled by the application of compounds of this invention are barnyard grass Echinochloa crusgalli , crabgrass Digitaria sauguinalis , coffeeweed Daubentonia punices , jimsonweed Datura stamonium , johnsongrass Sorghum halepense , tall morningglory J Ipomoea purpurea , wild mustard Brassica caber , teaweed Sida Spinosa , velvetleaf Abutilon Theophrasti , wild oats Avena fatua , yellow foxtail Setria glauca , yellow nutsedge Cyperus esculentus and the like. Compounds of this invention may be prepared for example by reacting a compound of the Formula VIII EMI5.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R11 are as defined with reference to the compounds of Formula I, with at least an equimolar amount of sulfonyl halide of the formula, R12S02 Hal, wherein Hal is halogen, preferably bromine or chlorine and R12 is as defined with reference to the compounds of Formula I. The reaction between theFormula VIII compound and the sulfonyl halide is typically conducted in an inert non protic solvent in the presence of an acid acceptor at a temperature ranging from ambient to reflux and the reaction mixture worked up in known fashion to isolate the compound of this invention. Alternatively, compounds of this invention may be prepared for example by reacting a compound of the Formula IX EMI5.2 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as defined with reference to the compounds of Formula I and B is halogen, hydroxy, or alkoxy with at least an equimolar amount of a sulfonylamine of the formula NH Rll SO2Rl2 wherein R11 and R12 are as defined with reference to the compounds of Formula I. The reaction between the compound ofFormula IX and the sulfonylamine is typically conducted in an inert non protic solvent and in the presence of an acid acceptor solvent at a temperature ranging from ambient to reflux and the reaction mixture worked up in known fashion to isolate a compound of the invention. Regarding starting materials for the above described preparations, the sulfonyl halide and sulfonyl amine can be obtained from commerical sources or synthesized by known techniques, whereas the preparation of compounds of the Formulae VIII and IX is described in European Patent Application Publication No. 0030138, the teachings of which are incorporated by reference herein as regards the mode of preparation of said compounds. Although the invention has been described in some detail with reference to certain embodiments thereof, it is to be understood that it is not intended to be so limited, since many variations may be made therein by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, except as defined in the appended claims.
