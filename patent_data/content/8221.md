# Electrical terminal and connector incorporating the same.

## Abstract
An elongate dual beam electrical terminal and a con nector containing a plurality of such terminals. The ter minal 10 has a contact at each end. One contact 20 is defined by a pair of longitudinally disposed beams 22 with laterally opposed stand off tabs 24 which preload the beams to provide for low insertion force interconnec tion with pin contacts. The connector includes a terminal housing 50 having a plurality of housing cavities 52 which contain the dual beam contact terminals. For use in one such connector, the contacts of the terminals opposite the dual beam ends of the terminals are wire insulation dis placement contacts 28 . The latter contacts protrude from the housing cavities 52 for electrical interconnection with insulated wires 100 carried on an insulation displacement contact block 70 . The block is mated with the terminal housing 50 , and a strain relief shroud 90 fits over the block 70 and latches to the terminal housing to form the assembled connector.
