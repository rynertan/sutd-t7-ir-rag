# Ladder stabilising device.

## Abstract
An adjustable stabilising device is described for attach ment to an extension ladder 20 having hollow rungs 28 without requiring modification of the ladder structure or affecting normal operation of the ladder 20 . In one embodi ment, the device has two stabilising elements 30 located on either side of the ladder 20 and which are connected to each other using rods 32 which extend through the hollow rungs 28 of the ladder 20 . Each stabilising element has an upper bracket 34 with a number of spaced apertures 37 to receive one end 52 of a support leg 50 and uneven ground can be accomodated by selecting the appropriate aperture to that foot 56 of the stabilising element lies on the ground. The stabilising elements have pivotable connections to permit the element be folded flat to lie on the sides of the ladder 20 for storage, and the stabiliser is designed to remain on the ladder 20 permanently without affecting normal ladder use.
