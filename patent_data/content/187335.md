# Method and circuit for digital frequency multiplication.

## Abstract
A method and circuit employ digital techniques in processing an input signal of a first frequency to develop an output signal of a second frequency that is a multiple of the first frequency. During each cycle of the input signal, a presettable down counter 146 is decremented from its maximum value at a rate of 1 T₁. The digital word appearing at the output of the down counter at the end of the cycle is programmed into an up counter 278 that is clocked at a rate of 1 T₂. The frequency of the signal developed at the overflow output 336 of the up counter is divided by two by a flip flop 342 whose output 348 provides a signal of a frequency which is T₁ 2T₂ times that of the input signal. The frequency of the output signal changes after one cycle of a change in frequency of the input signal. The frequency multiplication factor can be a noninteger value.
