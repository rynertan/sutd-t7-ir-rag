# Anode for molten salt electrolysis, method for the preparation thereof and electrolytic process using it.

## Abstract
An uncoated ceramic anode comprising titanium having a formal valence of 4 titanium having a formal valence of 3 and a dopant which prevents at least a portion of the titanium 3 from converting to titanium 4 when the ceramic anode is at operating cell conditions. The ceramic anode may have an electrically conductive substance en closed in its interior. The substance serves to transfer electrical energy from a power source to the ceramic member. These anodes are particularly useful when used in molten salt electrolytic cells because they give good electro lytic production rates while demonstrating exceptionally low wear rates.
