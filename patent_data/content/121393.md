# Method for quantitative discharge of molten material.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for discharging a controlled quantity of molten material, molten raw material and any supplementary material needed to provide a specified raw material formulation is charged intermittently into a tiltable melting furnace from which molten material is continuously disharged. The discharge of the molten material is effected by determining the weight of the tiltable melting furnace, which weight changes as the raw material is charged into and mol ten material is discharged from the furnace. The rate of change in weight of the molten material with respect to time is computed by a control device from the determined weights of the furnace, and the control device provides a control signal to activate the furnace mechanism when the rate of change in weight of the molten material with respect to time differs from a predetermined value.
