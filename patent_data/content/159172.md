# Static guiding mechanism for interlocking carton panels.

## Abstract
A mechanism for interlocking a pair of panels f, m of a wrap around type carton c , includes an elongate central forming block w having contoured opposed side faces 16, 18 about which the panels to be interlocked are progressive ly caused to fold during longitudinal movement relative thereto so that the panels are folded into edge facing relationship with one another. A pair of elongate flanking blocks V, VI are disposed adjacent the opposed side faces so as to provide a fissure 22, 26 therebetween through which respective ones of the panels are caused to move. The surface 20, 24 of the flanking blocks juxtaposed the side faces of the forming block are contoured to maintain the panels in close relationship with respect to the central forming block and to induce said progressive folding.

## Description
STATIC GUIDING MECHANISM FORINTERLOCKING CARTON PANELS This invention relates to a static guiding mechanism for folding and guiding and thence interloking the bot tom panels of a wrap around type carton. The invention is particularly concerned with interlo king panels of the sort in which sne 3nel has locking tabs the male panel any another panel has locking slits the female panel which are interengaged by a relative sliding movement of those panels so that the locking tabs are inserted in the locking slits. In a known guiding mechanism the panels are folded and guided by means of guide bars and a bottom forming plate positioned between the guide bars so that together the panels are folded into their correct relative positions for locking. However, in that construction difficulties have arisen in adjusting the mechanism correctly. This mainly is due to the fact that the guide bars have a multiplicity of adjustments. Each guide bar is attached to the frame of a packaging machine at two locations both of which locations are adjustable in three dimensions.Moreover, the forming plate also is adjustable indepen dently of and relative to the guide bars. The present invention provides a mechanism for interlocking a pair of panels of a wrap around type carton which mechanism comprises an elongate central forming block having contoured opposed side faces about which the panels to be interlocked are progressively caused to fold during longitudinal move.ent relative thereto so that the panels are folded into edge facing relationship with one another, and a pair of elongate flanking blocks disposed adjacent said opposed side faces so as to provide a fissure therebetween through which the panels are caused to move the surfaces of the flanking blocks juxtaposed said side faces of the forming block being contoured to maintain the panels in close relationship with respect to the central forming block and to india said progressive folding. An embodiment of the invention will ncw b desri bed, by way of example, with reference to the acoompany ing drawings, in whic FIGURES 1 to 8 are cross sectional views taKen at successive locations along the length of the msch3nis. in the direction of travel of a wrap around carton and show the bottom panels of the carton teing progressivaly folded into position for interlocking. FIGURES 10 to 13 are successive cross sectional views similar to FIGURES 1 to 8 but showing the bottom panels being interlocked one with the other, and FIGURE 14 is a parspective view of the mechanism in which the flanking blocks are shown detached from the central forming block. Referring to the drawings, the mechanism comprises an elongate sword S which is known per se and which has an upper surface 10 providing a platform on which product to be packaged e.g plastic cup p is supported dJr ing the panel locking operation.The undersurface of the sword has convergent faces 12, 14, respectively, and gradually reduces in cross sectional thickness towards one end in th direction sf carton movement when in use Thus, carton bottom panels progressively are formed about the undersurface of the sword and locked together and thereafter the products to be packaged are transferred from the upper surface of the sword to be supported by the interlocked carton bottom panels as the products and carton leave the free thin end of the sword. In FIGURES 1 to 13 of the drawings, the female bottom panel of a wrap around carton c is designated f and includes locking apertures at. a . Tha male bottom panel is designated m and includes locking tabs at its free edge a . The sword s is mounted atog a central elongate forming block w which has side faces 16 and 18 conttoured such that they progressively become more divergent along the length of the forming block whose cross section also diminishes in like manner to the sword. The mechanism further includes a pair of elongate flanking blocks V and V1 respsctively. Flanking block V includes contoured inner face 20 which is juxtaposed the side face 16 of central forming block W so as to form a fissure 22 therebetween. Likewise, flanking block V1 includes contoured inner face 24 which is jJxtaposed the side face 18 of the central forming block w so as to form fissure 26 therebetween. The inner faces of the flan ing blocks 20 and 24 are generally parallel to side faces 16 and 18 respectively, of the forming block and the relative pDsitioninD of the blocks is chosen so that tho fissures are wide enough to receive the thickness of the carton bottom panel els so that they slide re.latively freely through the mechanism but at the same time are caused to follow the folding path defined by the fissures. The side face 18 of the central forming block includes a stepped portion 28 on which an upturned endmost portion of the female panel slides. The upturned portion is held this in order to m3intin the locking apertures at a in opened condition ready for locking. The progressive folding of the panels m and f can be seen with particular reference to FIGURES 1 to 8 which show the panels at various stages as they move towards one another whilst also folding to adopt a more horizontal attitude. Of course, this occurs as the angle of the planes passing through the fissures becomes greater with respect to the vertical. At the position shown by FIGURE 8 the panels m and f are about to leave the forward that is upstream in terms of carton movement end of the can tral forming block at which moment the panels are in position for interlocking. FIGURES 9 to 13 showing the progressive interlocking of the panels about the sword w as the carton continues its forward movement until, when the locking components are properly engaged, the bottom panels and product leave the end of the sword. This occurs immediately after the condition show by FIGURE 13. The mechanism is particularly but nst exclusively, suitable for use with panels having locking tabs and locking slits as disclosed in our co pending BritishPatent Application No 84r1610. In this event the central forming block may incorporate a static folding device as disclosed in sur co pending British Patent Application No 8416280 for folding over portions of such locking tabs prior to the locking procedure.
