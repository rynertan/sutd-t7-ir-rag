# Mandible stimulator.

## Abstract
A mandible stimulator for causing involuntary mandibular closure operating in either a test mode for measuring the conductivities in a pair of electrode circuits or a pulse mode for generating adjustable amplitude constant current pulses in the electrode circuits. In the test mode a constant voltage is applied to left and right electrode circuits. A first comparator circuit flashes respective open circuit warning lamps 30 if the current through either of the electrodes is less than a preset value, and it flashes a good connection indicator lamp 32 if the current through both electrodes is greater than the preset value. A second comparator circuit detects a current unbalance between the electrode circuits and flashes respective low current warning lamps 34 in response thereto. In the pulse mode an oscillator repetatively charges a capacitor to a high voltage through a pulse transformer, and the high voltage is then gated to a control circuit which generates a current pulse having an adjustable amplitude through the electrode circuits. The amplitude of the current through one electrode circuit with respect to the current through the other electrode circuit may be adjusted with a balance control 26 .
