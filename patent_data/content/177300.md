# BYPASS DIODE ASSEMBLY FOR PHOTOVOLTAIC MODULES

## Abstract
A bypass diode assembly 10 for a photovoltaic module 11 incorporating a plurality of electrically conductive strips 12 , each having a long leg 13 and a short leg 14 . The long leg 13 of each conductive strip 12 is in overlapped relation with the long leg 13 of another conductive strip 12 . A diode 21 is interposed between successive conductive strips 12 in the vicinity of the overlapped relation and is electrically associated therewith. A diagonal arm 20 is carried by each long leg 13 and is oriented to dissipate stress experienced by the conductive strip 12 . The short leg 14 is suitably located and configured for electrically com municating with the substrate layer 15 of a corresponding photovoltaic cell strip 16 .
