# Method for producing an analytical antibody probe, an analytical antibody probe, and a method for analysing a sample for certain antibodies.

## Abstract
The complexity of antigenic test material in tests which employ the antigen antibody reaction increases the likelihood of false results. In particular, the com plexity of antigenic test material in diagnostic tech niquest increases the likelihood of false positive signals generated due to antibodies stimulated by organisms showing some but all antigenic properties with the test material. In conventional tests, a single positive or ne gative signal is obtained which is the result of a com plex and undifferentiated array of structural components of an organism or material antigenically related to it. In contrast, the present invention greatly expands the use of the antigen antibody reaction in analysis techniquest and diagnosis by providing a multi signal. The invention provides a method for producing an analytical antibody probe for detecting the presence of antibodies specific for particular protein and or poly saccharide material, which method comprises disposing upon a solid state substrate in a pre determined spatial relationship a set of differentiated antigenic compo nents which have been derived from said protein or polysaccharide material, said set of differentiated anti genic components being selected such that at least a subset thereof is known to be reactive with said anti bodies. The invention also embraces the analytical anti body probe as such and a corresponding method for analysing a sample to determine the presence and distri bution of antibodies specific for particular protein and or polysaccharide material.

## Description
METHOD FOR PRODUCING AN ANALYTICAL ANTIBODY PROBE, AN ANALYTICAL ANTIBODY PROBE, AND A METHOD FOR ANALYSING A SAMPLE FOR CERTAIN ANTIBODIES The present invention provides, in general, a method for producing an analytical antibody probe, an analytical antibody probe, and a method for analysing a sample for certain antibodies. The invention has particular value in the diagnosis of disease or allergy in patents. More particularly, the invention permits an improved method for such diagnosis, and provides an improved product for conducting such diagnosis. Many clinical diagnositc techniques have, as their fundamental basis, the antigen antibody reaction, This reaction serves as a defence against micro organisms and other foreign bodies as part of the body s normal immunological response. Detection of the presence of antigenantibody reactions in tests performed upon serum obtained from a patient may indicate the presence or absence of antibodies in the patient s serum. A positive test for reaction of antibody with a specific antigen may indicate a presence of a corresponding disease or at least suggest that diagnostic conclusion. Known clinical diagnostic procedures that test for the antigen antibody reaction in sera serotests may take a wide variety of forms. Some utilize antigens anchored to the surface of inert particles. In the presence of specific antibody, these particulate antigens clump visibly in an agglutination reaction. Such a procedure is widely employed in the diagnosis of syphilis and is known as the VenerealDisease Research Laboratory VDRL test. Other tests may involve the attachment of a fluorescent or radioactive moiety in such a way that its presence indicates that the antigen antibody reaction has occurred. In a similar manner, enzymes have been linked as a detectable moiety the socalled enzyme linked immunosorbent assay LIST . The hallmark of conventional serotests is that they measure a single positive or negative signal, Signals may be, for example, hemagglutination, hemagglutination inhibition, complement fixation, surface fluorescence, particle agglutination and so on. That single positive or negative signal is usually a complex and undifferentiated array of the structural components of an organism or material antigenically related to it. This complexity of the antigen test material increases the likelihood that false positive signals will be generated due to antibodies stimulated by other organisms sharing some but not all antigenic properties with the test material In contrast the present invention enables the provision of a diagnostic method and means by which the antigen antibody reaction may be greatly expanded as a diagnostic tool.Using the invention the presence of a specific disease, a specific stage of a disease, or an allergy in a patient may be detected by a simple procedure. Thus the invention provides a method for producing an analytical antibody probe for detecting the presence of antibodies specific for particular protein and or polysaccharide material, which method comprises disposing upon a solid state substrate in a pre determined spatial relationship a set of differentiated antigentic components which have been derived from said protein or polysaccharide material, said set of differentiated antigentic components being selected such that at least a subset thereof is known to be reactive with said antibodies.The invention also provides an analytical antibody probe for detecting the presence of antibodies specific for particular protein and or polysaccharide material, which probe comprises a solidstate substrate upon which is disposed in a pre determined spatial relationship a set of differentiated antigenic components derived from. said protein or polysaccharide material, said set of differentiated antigenic components being selected such that at least a subset thereof is known to be reactive with said antibodies. Specific aspects of the invention are a a method for producing a diagnostic antibody probe, comprising, disposing upon a solid state susbtrate a set of differentiated antigenic components of a larger set of proteins or polysaccharides in a predetermined spatial relationship, said larger set being related to a disease, disease stage or allergy under diagnosis, said set of differentiated antigenic components being selected such that at least a subset of said differentiated antigenic components is known to be reactive with antibodies present in serum obtained from a patient having the specific disease stage or allergy and b a diagnostic antibody probe comprising a solid state substrate upon which is disposed in a pre determined spatial relationship a set of differentiated antigenic components of a larger set of proteins or polysaccharides, said larger set being related to a disease, disease stage or allergy under diagnosis, said set of differentiated antigenic components being selected such that at least a subset of said differentiated antigenic components is known to be reactive with antibodies present in serum obtained from a patient having the specific disease, disease stage or allergy. One further aspect of the invention is a method for analysing a sample to determine the presence and distribution of antibodies specific for particular protein and or polysaccharide material, which method comprises providing a solid state substrate upon which is disposed in a predetermined spatial relationship a set of differentiated antigenic components derived from said protein or polysaccharide material, said set of differentiated antigenic components being selected such that at least a subset thereof is known to be reactive with said antibodies, contacting said substrate with said sample under conditions which permit reaction of any of said antibodies in the sample with the antigenic components on the substrate, and detecting the existence and pattern of antigen antibody reactions on the substrate. The invention will now be further described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a photograph of a conventional SDS polyacrylamide gel showing the total protein profile ofT. pallidum after staining FIGURE 2 is a photograph of an autoradiogram of twelve diagnostic strips of T. pallidum, constructed in accordance with the invention, after exposure to sera drawn from patients, eight of whom had different stages of syphilis and four of whom had exhibited false positive BFP on standard serological tests for syphilis FIGURE 3 is a photograph of an autoradiogram of nine diagnostic strips of T. pallidum, constructed in accordance with the invention, after exposure to sera drawn from patients suffering from late syphilis and secondary syphilis FIGURE 4 is a photograph of an autoradiogram of ten diagnostic strips of T. pallidum, constructed in accordance with the invention, after exposure to sera drawn from patients suffering from early latent and late latent syphilis FIGURE 5 is a photograph of conventional SDS gels showing the total protein profiles of five different immunotypes of Chlamydia FIGURE 6 is a photograph of an autoradiogram of five diagnostic strips of Chlamydia trachomatis,constructed in accordance with the invention, after exposure to rabbit antiserum to Chalmydia trachomatis immuno type B FIGURE 7 is a photograph of an autoradiogram of seven diagnostic strips of Toxoplasma gondii, constructed in accordance with the invention, after exposure to sera drawn from patients with chronic and acute toxoplasmosis FIGURE 8 is a photograph of an autoradiogram of diagnostic strips of cytomegalovirus infected cells and cell free preparation of partially purified virus, constructed in accordance with the invention, after exposure to patient sera FIGURE 9 is a photograph of an autoradiogram of diagnostic strips of rabbit kidney cells infected withHerpes simplex virus I or II, constructed in accordance with the invention, after exposure to sera drawn from patients suffering from Herpes infections FIGURE 10 is a photograph of an autoradiogram of diagnostic strips of capsular polysaccharide types 4 and 8 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, constructed in accordance with the invention, after exposure to an immune serum FIGURE 11 is a photograph of an autoradiogram of a diagnostic strip of bee venom, constructed in accordance with the invention, after exposure to serum drawn from a patient allergic to bee venom FIGURES 12 and 13 are photographs of an autoradiogram of diagnostic strips of type L2 C. trachomatis, constructed in accordance with the invention, after reaction with sera from patients with type F infection and type D infection, respectively FIGURE4 is a photograph of an autoradiogram of diagnostic strips of T. pallidum, constructed in accordance with the invention, after exposure to sera drawn from patients suffering kfrom syphilis and after exposure toIgG and IgM specific antisera probes FIGURE 15 is a photograph of an autoradiogram of diagnostic strips of Toxoplasma gondii, constructed in accordance with the invention, after exposure to serum drawn from a patient suffering from acute toxoplasmosis and after exposure to IgG and IgM specific probes FIGURE 16 is a photograph of an autoradiogram of diagnostic strips of cytomegalovirus, constructed in accordance with the invention, after exposure to a serum pool drawn from patients suffering from viral infection and after exposure to IgG and IgM specific probes FIGURE 17 is a photograph of an autoradiogram of diagnostic strips of Toxoplasma gondii, constructed in accordance with the invention, when the Toxoplasma antigens were separated on a nondenaturing isoelectricfocusing gel FIGURE 18 is a photograph of an autoradiogram of diagnostic strips of Toxoplasma gondii, prepared in accordance with the invention, when the Toxoplasma antigens are separated on a nondenaturing native gel system and FIGURE 19 is a photograph of an autoradiogram of a diagnostic strip of cloned T. pallidum specific antigens, constructed in accordance with the invention, after exposure to sera from patients suffering from syphilis. Verv generally, the use of th3 invention or diagnosis involves a method con pflsing providing a solid state substrate upon which is disposed in a predetermined relationship a set of differentiated antigenic components of a larger set of proteins or polysaccharides. The larger set is related to the disease or allergy under diagnosis. The set of components is selected such that aat least a subset of the components is known to be reactive with antibodies present in serum obtained from a patient having the specific disease or allergy. The substrate is contacted with serum obtained from the patient under diagnosis under conditions which permit reaction of antibodies in the serum with antigenic components on the substrate.The existence and pattern of antigen antibody reactions on the substrate is then detected for correspondence with the pattern of those components on the substrate known to be reactive for the specific disease, the specific stage of the disease, or the allergy. The method detailed here for disease diagnosis differs markedly from conventional serotests in that what comprises a positive test is not the presence of one signal, but rather the appearance of a series of signals that represent antibody response to defined antigens associated with a specific pathogen or disease The number and nature of the signals which define a disease state are defined empirically for each specific disease all humans with this disease display the same multiple signals characteristic of that disease. More particularly, the invention, although based upon the antigen antibody reaction phenomenon, take advantage of a discovery of major significance. If protein or polysaccharide material related to a specific disease, or stage of a disease, or an allergy is differentiated in such a way as to establish a spatial relationship of differentiated antigenic components, a plurality of antigenantibody reactions may be detected upon exposure to serum from a diseased patient. The extent and pattern of such reactions, with proper differentiation, can be made highly specific to a given disease. Accordingly, a sort ofmolec ular antigenic fingerprint may be established which will identify a particular disease and no other.Moreover, this molecular antigenic fingerprint may be designed so as to distinguish between historical antibodies, i.e., residual IgG antibodies which indicate previous exposure to a given antigen, and current antibody, i.e., recentIgM antibodies which indicate very recent exposure to a given antigen. In the case of allergy diagnosis, the antibody detected is immunoglobulin IgE. The method of the invention utilizes a solidstate substrate upon which is disposed in a predetermined spatial relationship a set of differentiated antigenic components of a larger set of proteins or polysaccharides.This larger group is related to the disease, the stage of the disease, or the allergy under diagnosis. It may be the pathogen itself e.g., Herpes virus I or 110 or it may be a tissue sample e.g., of a sarcoma tumor or it may be an allergen such as various types of grasses or pollen.Frequently, the source of the larger set of proteins or polysaccharides will itself be antigenic for a particular disease but, because of non specificity, cross reactivity, or other problems, is unsatisfactory for diagnostic use. The set of differentiated antigenic components of the larger set of proteins or polysaccharides is chosen for its specific ability to identify the disease, the stage of the disease, or allergy of interest. These components are selected such that at least a subset of the components is known to be reactive with antibodies present in serum obtained from a patient having the specific disease or allergy. The subsets are determined empirically in accordance with techniques described below. The process by which the components are differentiated depends upon the particular disease, the larger protein or polysaccharide from which the components are derived, and the particular antibodies which are to be detected e.g., IgG, IgM, orIgE .Such differentiation processes may include, but are not limited to, electrophoresis SDS or native gel , isoelectricfocusing, thin layer chromatography, and centrifugation. Another differentiation process, once the nature of the subject of components is ascertained, is to produce each component of the subset separately by means of genetically modified microorganisms. Each component may then be placed separately on the substrate. In any case, the individual differentiated components are positioned upon a solid state substrate such as a cellulose strip. The precise manner of attaching the components to the substrate will depend upon the nature of the components and the substrate. For example, if electro phoresis is utilized as a differentiation process, a use transfer technique is the so called filter affinity transfer as described by Erlich, H.A., et al., in Journ. Biol. Chem., 254 12240 12247 1979 . A typical solid state substrate may be a cellulose strip to which a plurality of differentiated components of the pathogen responsible for a disease have been transferred. When the strip is exposed to a patient s serum, components which are reactive with antibodies in the serum bind to it and may be detected by any suitable assay. Before such exposure, the strip may be blank in appearance with the differentiated components not visible.Once exposed to antibodies, the antibody antigen reactions cause the antibodies to bind to the strip in a pattern that is indicative of the present or absence of a specific disease. Through previous empirical testing, it can be readily established as to which differentiated proteins or groups of proteins on a given substrate will react with antibodies in the serum of a patient having the specific disease that is of interest. Thus, separate strips may be produced that are specific tot for example, Chlamydia, syphilis, and gonorrhea, respectively. Once the strip or solid state substrate is produced with the empirically determined and selected pattern of differentiated antigenic components established on the substrate, it is in a form useful for clinical diagnosis.For such a use, the substrate is exposed or contacted with serum obtained from the patient under diagnosis. The conditions under which the contact occurs are established so as to permit reaction of antibodies in the serum withantigenic components on the substrate. Following suitable illumination steps, e.g., radioactively labelled probes specific for human immunoglobulin classes and autoradiography, the strip is examined to ascertain the pattern, if any, of antibody antigen reactions which has developed. If the pattern corresponds to the pattern known for the particular disease to which the strip or substrate corresponds, a positive diagnosis is obtained. Otherwise, the diagnosis is negative. Actual detection of the antigen antibody reactions may employ other than autoradiographic assay of the type shown inFIGURE 2. For example, colorimetric assays may also be employed. Traditionally, radioactively labelled S. atreus protein A has been used as a probe for IgG antibodies.To distinguish between reactions with historical antibody IgG and new antibody IgM , antiserum to human IgM may 125 be labelled in a variety of ways, e.g., 125I or fluores cein, and used as probe to detect formation of new human antibody IgM . This provides the ability to distinguish between persons with a history of a disease who do not currently have an active form of that disease and persons with the active form of the disease. Historical antibodies will, in many cases, remain with a cured person for life. The present invention will be more readily understood by means of the following examples. These examples are set forth for the purpose of elaborating on the invention and are not intended to limit the invention in any way. Example I. Use of the Invention for the Correct Diagnosis of Syphilis FIGURE 1 is a photograph showing the total protein profile of Treponema pallidum. These proteins are separated and stained on a conventional SDS polyacrylamide gel. To obtain this profile, intact T. pallidum was suspended in an electrophoresis sample buffer comprised of 62.5 mbl tris pH 6.8 , 2 sodium dodecylsulfate, and 5 mercaptoethanol. The sample was then applied to an SDS polyacrylamide gel system as described in Laemmli, U.K.,Nature London 227 680 685 1970 . The gel was run until the tracking dye reached the bottom of the gel. In FIGURE 1, the left hand column represents the T. pallidum profile, whereas the right hand column is a system of molecular weight markers as is well known in the use of polyacrylamide gel separations. FIGURE 1 provides a base for comparison of the actual protein separation with the antigenic activity describedxin FIGURE 2. In FIGURE 2, diagnostic strips were prepared in accordance with the invention using the total protein separation of T. pallidum illustrated in FIGURE 1. To prepare the strips, the gel is overlaid with nitrocellulose paper as described by Towbin, H., Staehlin, T., andGordon, J., PNAS USA 76 4350 4354 1979 . The paper is then covered with scouring pads and supported by lucite grids with numerous pores. The assembly is held together with rubber bands and is then placed in a single chamber for electrophoresis such that the surface of the gel applied directly to the paper is facing the anode. Elec trophoresis is performed in an elctrode buffer comprised of 25 mM tris, 192 mM glycine, and 20 volume volume methanol at pH 8.3. Electrophoresis is carried out for 90 minutes.The nitrocellulose at the end of this procedure contains the proteins arrayed as they have been separated according to molecular weight and is referred to as the blot. The blots were then soaked in a solution of 1 bovine serum albumin in a buffer comprised of 50 may tris pH 7.5 , 0.9 sodium chloride, 0.25 gelatin, 0.2 sodium azide, and 0.1 NP 40 TSGAN for ten minutes at room temperature. This was to saturate all remaining reactive sites on the paper. At this point, the blots are ready for use and may be stored by freezing or other suitable means. Each of the strips in FIGURE 2 is a blot of theT. pallidum total protein profile after exposure to patient serum representing different stages of syphilis 8 patients and representing non syphilitic patients who showed false positive BFP in standard serological tests for syphilis 4 patients . Serum dilutions were used at 1 1000 with twelve hours at room temperature with gentle shaking.After this period of incubation with serum, the blots were rinsed several times with TSGAN and then washed with TSGPIN for 20 60 minutes at room temperature, again with gentle agitation. Then 2 4 microcuries of protein A with a speci 7 fic activity of greater than 107 counts per minute micro gram is added in a volume of 100 200 milliliters of TSGAN and indubation continued with a gentle agitation for 60 minutes at room temperature. A similar incubation buffer system is described in Renard, J., Reiser, J., and Stark,G. R., PNAS USA 76 3116 312 1979 . The blots were then rinsed several times withTSGAN, washed with TSGAN with gentle agitation at room temperature for 20 minutes and then rinsed several times with distilled water, dried with a hair dryer and then subjected to autoradiography. The autoradiography was onKodak X omat R film and DuPont Cronex intensifying screens.Autoradiography usually takes from 2 16 hours. Of the strips for 8 syphilitic patients shown in FIGURE 2, it may be seen that similar reaction patterns exist, particularly with respect to patients 1 5 and 7.This is true also of patients 6 and 8, although the strength of the reactions is less pronounced. On the other hand, patients who were false positive in the VDRL test, shown in FIGURE 2 as patients 9 12, are clearly distinguishable from the true positives by the tests conducted in accordance with the invention. FIGURE 3 shows diagnostic strips of the IgG antibody response to peptides of T. pallidum from patients with late syphilis and secondary syphilis. The gels, protein samples and strips were prepared as outlined above.In FIGURE 3, the far right strip is a system of molecular weight markers. Strips 1 8 illustrate the antibody response from patients suffering from late syphilis, while strip 9 shows the antibody response indicative of the secondary form of the disease. FIGURE 4 shows diagnostic strips of the IgG antibody response to peptides of T. pallidum frcm patients with early latent and late latent syphilis. Again the samples were prepared as outlined above, and again the far right column is a system of standard molecular weight gel markers. Strips 1 and 2 demonstrate the response from patients in the early latent stage of the disease.Strips 3 10, which exhibit a different fingerprint pattern, are from patients in the late latent stage of the disease. It can thus be seen that the diagnostic strip of the invention provides a much more reliable test for indicating the presence of the various stages of syphilis than do the standard serological tests for syphilis. Example II. Use of the Invention to Detect Chlamydia Antigen FIGURE 5, left hand columns 1 5, show the stained total proteins of five different immunotypes of Chlamydia.Column 6 in FIGURE 5 is a molecular weight marker system.By standard serology, these immunotypes are non crossreactive. Accordingly, a separate antiserum for clinical use must be prepared for each serotype. FIGURE 6 shows the strips of the invention prepared in accordance with Example I after exposure to rabbit antiserum to Chlamydia trachomatis immuno type B and autoradiography. Preparations and procedures were as inExample I. All C. trachomatis immuno types have extensive cross reaction of the major antigenic proteins. It may be seen that the left hand 4 strips show strong reaction whereas the strip in the far right hand side, specific forC. psittaci, shows weak relatedness of only two antigens.This illustrates that a single C. trachomatis immunotype is a sufficient source of antigens for testing human infection with any other C. trachomatis immunotypes, and yet provides specificity in that other types of Chlamydia may be readily distinguished. Example III. Use of the Invention To Detect Toxoplasma gondii Antigen FIGURE 7 is a photograph showing various antigenic bands of Toxoplasma gondii that react withantGxies in the sera of patients with chronic and acute toxoplasmosis. To obtain the observed patterns, the toxoplasmal antigens were separated on a conventional SDS polyacrylamide gel. A sonicate of Toxoplasma was suspended in an equal volume of elactrophoresis sample buffer consisting of 0.125M trizma base pH 6.8 , 2.5 sodium dodecylsulfate, and 2.5 B mercaptoethanol. The sample was then applied to an SDS polyacrylamide gel system as described inLaemmli, U. K., Nature London 227 680 685 1970 . The gel was run until the tracking dye reached the bottom of the gel. The gel was then washed for 15 minutes in water and in two 5 minute washes of 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 7.0.The peptide components of Toxoplasma, separated by molecular weight in the SDS polyacrylamide gel, were electrophoretically transferred onto cyanogen bromide activated paper as follows. The gel was placed on a scotch bright pad covered with filter paper. A sheet of cyanogen bromide treated filter paper was laid on the gel and another sheet of filter paper and a scotch bright pad was placed on top.The assembly is placed in an E C electroblot unit with the cyanogen bromide paper facing the anode. Electrophoresis was carried out in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 7, at 25 volts for one hour. All remaining reactive sites on the cyanogen bromide paper are bound and or inactivated by soaking the paper in a solution of 1M glycine and 1 bovine serum albumin for 0.5 to 3 hours. The paper was washed three times for 5 15 minutes each with agitation in a wash solution containing 0.1 ovalbumin, 0.1 tween 20, 0.02 sodium azide in phosphate buffered saline. The paper is then incubated at room temperature with gentle agitation for 2 3 hours in diluted human serum. The sera used in FIGURE 7 are from patients with chronic or acute toxoplasmosis.The patient s serum is diluted 1 25 in wash solution. After the incubation with serum, the paper is washed three times for 5 15 minutes with shaking in wash solution. The 1251 Protein A is added to the paper using a 1 200 dilution of stock X5pg ml, 15pci pg in wash solution. The protein A is iodinated using thechloramine T method as described by Erlich, H., Cohen, S., and McDevitt, H., in Cell, 13 681 689 1978 . The paper is incubated with the 125I Protein A for 1 3 hours at room temperature with agitation. The paper is again washed as above, dried and placed under Kodak XAR 5 X ray film for 16 hours. Strips 1, 2 and 7 in FIGURE 7 show the reaction of sera from patients suffering from chronic toxoplasmosis strips 3 and 4 illustrate the acute form of the disease.Controls from uninfected patients are shown in strips 6 and 7. Collectively the strips show that use of the invention allows not only the detection of toxoplasmosis but also the ability to distinguish between chronic and acute forms of the disease. Example IV. Use of the Invention To Detect Cytomegalovirus Antigen The strips in FIGURE 8 illustrate the banding patterns obtained when cytomegalovirus infected cells and cell free preparation of partially purified virus are reacted with patient sera. The electrophoresis and transfer are performed as outlined in Example III. The preparation of the infected cells was done as follows. Two Corning 490cm roller bottles containing a confluent layer of passage eight human embryo lung cells were each inoculated with 2.5 mls of infected cells con taining between 107 and 108 viral particles ml. Fourteen mls of Eagle minimal essential medium plus 10 fetal calf serum was added to each bottle. The cells were incubated at 370C. for 1.5 hours before addition of a further 93 mls medium. Seven days later the cells were trypsinised off and centrifuged down at 2,000 RPM for 5 minutes at room temperature. The resulting 1.5 mls of packed cells were resuspended in 3.5 mls of medium, frozen in dry ice and stored at 200C. for 13 days. The free virus is contained in the supernatant from infected cells. A control flask of uninfected human embryo lung cells was also prepared. Example V. Use of the Invention To Detect Herpes Simplex Virus Antigen FIGURE 9 illustrates this Example. Rabbit kidney cells were infected with either Herpes simplex virus typeI or Herpex simplex virus type II. Peptides from these infected cells were separated on 9.5 denaturing SDS polyacrylamide gels as described in Example I. Diagnostic strips derived from the gels were then cross reacted with serum from patients suffering with type I or type IIHerpes infections. FIGURE 9 is a photograph of an autoradiogram of these diagnostic strips following exposure to appropriate radioactive probes. Strip 1, i.e., the far right hand strip on the photograph, shows a standard system of molecular weight markers. Strips 2 and 3 show how serum from patient J.K.reacts with antigens from the two types of Herpes. Strip 2 represents proteins derived from Herpes virus type I while strip 3 represents proteins derived from Herpes virus type II. Comparison of the strips shows that serum from patient J.K. contains IgG antibodies that react strongly with the peptides derived from Herpes virus type I infected cells, and only weakly with peptides derived from Herpes virus type II infected cells. Strips 8, 9 and 10 show the reaction of serum from patient L.O. Strips 8 and 9 represent proteins derived from Herpes virus type I strip 8 proteins demonstrate an IgG reaction while strip 9 demonstrates the presence of IgM s. Strip 10 represents proteins derived from Herpes virus type II. Comparison of the strips shows that serum from patient L.O. contains IgG antibodies to proteins derived from Herpes virus type II infected cells.They also show L.O. s serum reacts only weakly with protein derived from Herpes virus type I infected cells.Strips 4 7 and strips 11 and 12 are not relevant to thisExample. Example VI. Use of the Invention for Detection of Polysaccharide Antigen FIGURE 10 illustrates the reaction of immune serum with pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide of types 4 and 8. Three micrograms of purified polysaccharidewere spotted onto two nitrocellulose strips. Pre immune serum did not react with these antigens. Immune serum to type 8 reacted strongly with type 8 and less strongly with type 4 pneumococcal polysaccharides. Example VII. Use of the Invention for Diagnosis of an Allergy FIGURE 11 illustrates the reaction of sera from a patient allergic to bee venom. The strip was prepared using intact bee venom profiled on a SDS polyacrylamide gel in accordance with the previously described procedures.Serum dilutions were 1 20 with exposure for 18 hours at room temperature with gentle shaking. The probe used for autoradiography was 1251 rabbit antihuman IgE. Example VIII. The Invention is Not Limited by Immunotype Specificity FIGURE 12 illustrates the reaction of serum from a patient with type F infection with proteins of type L2 C.trachomatis. FIGURE 13 shows, on an identical strip, the reaction of serum from a patient with type D infection with proteins of type L2. The similarities in the patterns are readily apparent. Unlike the microimmunofluorescence tests for C. trachomatis, where human infection with these immunotypes results in non cross reactive surface antibody, these patterns show that the reaction is C. trachomatis species specific, not immunotype specific. Both strips were prepared and exposed in accordance with the procedures indicated in connection with Example I. Example IX. Use of the Invention to Distinguish Between IgG and IgM Immunoglobulins The diagnostic strips of the invention can be used to distinguish between classes of immunoglobulins.FIGURE 14 illustrates how IgM and IgG from syphilis patients may be readily distinguished, and how the presence of either of these antibodies may be distinguished from sera from normal patients. In FIGURE 14, T. pallidum is separated and stained on SDS polyacrylamide gel as is described inExample I. Rabbit antiserum to human IgM was labelled withI and used as a probe for IgM. I labelled Protein A of S. aureus was used as a probe for IgG. The furthest right hand column in the FIGURE 14 photograph is a standard system of molecular weight markers well known to those skilled in the art. The remaining sixteen columns represent diagnostic strips after exposure to serum from eight different patients. The right hand strip 125 A in each pair was probed with I rabbit anti human IgM 125 and the left hand strip B with Protein A, which is specific for IgG. The first five patients i.e., the first ten strips illustrate sera from patients with primary syphilis. The next three patients i.e., the remaining six strips illustrate sera from normal humans not infected with syphilis. Strips from these last three patients show that uninfected humans have little or no IgG or IgM antibodies to antigenic proteins derived from the organism that causes syphilis.In contrast, all patients with primary syphilis have IgG and IgM antibodies to the proteins from T. pallidum.The IgG or historic antibodies are clearly distinguishable from the current IgM antibodies in all the patientsswith primary syphilis. FIGURE 15 shows that the diagnostic strips of the present invention can be used to distinguish between IgG andIgM antibodies in the sera of patients suffering from toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma gondii were separated and run on SDS polyacrylamide gel, as is described in Example III transfer of the gel protein pattern to the diagnostic strips is also described in that Example. Strips 1 and 2 were incubated with the serum from a patient with an acute case of toxoplasmosis. I labelled Protein A of S. aureus was used as a probe for IgG in strip 1. I labelled affinity purifiedGoat antibodies to human IgN was used as a probe for IgM.Strip 3 represents well known molecular markers. FIGURE 16 illustrates that the diagnostic strips can be used to distinguish between IgG and IgM antibodies in the sera of patients infected with cytomegalovirus. The samples and steps were prepared as outlined in Examples III and IV. Again, 125I labelled Protein A was used as a probe for IgG and 125I labelled affinity purified Goat antibodies to human IgM were used as a probe for IgM. Strip 1 in FIGURE 16 shows the presence of IgG, strip 2 the presence ofIgM. Strip 3 is a system of standard molecular markers. Example X. Antigenic Proteins for the Diagnostic Strips Can be Separated on Nondenatur ing Gels.A. Use of nondenaturing isoelectricfocusing gel. FIGURE 17 illustrates the Toxoplasma antigen bands observed when the antigen is separated on nondenaturing isoelectricfocusing gel and sequentially incubated with patient sera and 125I Protein A. A sonicate of Toxoplasma gondii is made 1 in noniodet P40. Nonsolubilized membranes are pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 RPM for 2 minutes. The supernate is pipetted directly onto the pre run gel. The gel is made 5 in acrylamide, 0.0013 in bis acrylamide T 5.1t, C 2.6 , 13 in sucrose, 2 noniodetP40, and 5 in ampholytes pH 3.5 10.0. The gel is polymerized with ammonium persulfate and TEMED for 1 hour. The gel is prerun for 1 2 hours of 30ma constant current with a voltage maximum of 1000. The anode solution is 1M phosphoric acid, the cathode 1M sodium hydroxide. The samples are added to the gel and electrophoresed for 2.5 hours at 1000 volts. The separated antigens are transferred to cyanogen bromide treated paper as outlined in Example III, except that the gel is not washed with water and sodium acetate before transfer. In FIGURE 17, strips 1 4 show the isoelectric bands from patients suffering from toxoplasmosis. Strips 5 and 6 are from uninfected humans and therefore show no bands. Strip 7 is a positive with a rabbit antiserum. B. Use of nondenaturing native gel. FIGURE 18 shows the Toxoplasma gondii banding pattern obtained when antigens are separated on a nondenaturing native gel system and sequentially incubated with patient sera and 125I Protein A. The procedure described in Example III for electrophoresis and transfer ofToxoplasma is utilized with the following modifications.The gel is made 7.58 in acrylamide, 0.2 in bis acrylamide, 2 in noniodet P40, and 75mM trizma base plus 32X boric acid pH 8.9. The gel is polymerized with ammonium persulfate and TEMED for 20 minutes. The gel is overlayed with a stocking gel made 4 in acrylamide, 0.1 in bis acrylamide, 2 noniodet P40, and 37.5mM trizma base plus 16mE1 boric acid pH 8.9. This stacking gel is polymerized with ammonium persulfate and TEMED for 10 minutes. The electrode buffer for the system is 0.1 noniodet P40, 75mM trizma base, 32mM boric acid pH 8.9. The Toxoplasma sonicated organisms are made 1 in noniodet P40 and applied to the gel as in ExampleIII. Strip 1 is from an uninfected patient and therefore shows no bands characteristic of Toxoplasma antigens.Strips 2 6 are from patients suffering from various forms of toxoplasmosis all show bands characteristic of the disease. Strip 7 is a positive control with a rabbit antiserum. Example XI. The Antigenic Proteins of the Invention can be Produced by Genet ically Engineered Microorganisms. The antigenic proteins used in the invention can be products of genes derived from antigenic organisms that have been separately cloned into suitable genetically engineered host microorganisms. Expression of cloned T. pallidumDNA in E. coli illustrates such antigenic protein production. In this Example, Treponema pallidum were first harvested from the testicles of ten rabbits. The testicles were extensively minced in phosphate buffered saline before the resulting extract was subjected to several cycles of differential centrifugation to remove cellular debris. The final supernatant, which contained motile and virulent T.pallidum, was further purified on a density gradient using a homogenous solution of Percoll, produced by PharmaciaCorporation, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854. Centrifugation at 20,000 RPM for 20 minutes produced a band of relatively pure, motile and virulent T. pallidum. The band was pulled from the Percoll gradient material, subjected to a dilution in phosphate buffered saline, and then pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x G for 2 hours. The pellet ofT. pallidum was resuspended in buffer containing tris EDTA, pH 7.5, before treatment with the detergent Sarcosyl, Nlauroylsarcosine produced by Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis,Missouri 63178, to liberate the treponemal DNA. The resulting DNA detergent extract was centrifuged to equalibrium on a cesium chloride density gradient.The treponemal DNA band was then pulled from the gradient and dialysed againstSau3A I restriction buffer minus magnesium. The dialyzedDNA was partially digested with Sau3A I restriction endonuclease using techniques well known to those skilled in the art, and then ligated to purified BamH I cut arms of coliphage Charon 30. Rimm, D. L, et al, Gene 12 301 309 1980 .Ligation procedures were again those well known to those skilled in the art of recombinant DNA. The T. pallidum DNAcoliphage Charon 30 construct was packaged in vitro, Blattner,F. R., et al., Science 202 1279 1284 1978 and then used to infect E. coli strain K 802. The resulting plaques were screened for T. pallidum antigens by an in situ radioimmunoassay. Screening was done by a modification of the Western blotting procedure of Towbin, H., et al., PNAS USA 76 43504354 1979 . Nitrocellulose discs were laid over the phage plaques, and the discs allowed to absorb protein for 10 30 minutes. Little protein was absorbed from unlysed E. coli of the lawn.The nitrocellulose filters were then coated with ovalbumin by soaking for 10 minutes in 5 ovalbumin in 50 mM tris HC1 pH 7.5 , 150 mM NaCl, 0.15 sodium azide TSA 5e0A . The plaque blots were incubated overnight in either human secondary syphilitic sera or in normal human sera both sera were diluted 1 300 in TSA 1 0A. Autoradiograms were prepared as described in Towbin, supra, after 125 the blots were exposed to I labelled S. aureus protein A. One plaque, designated Tp3A, which gave a particularly strong reaction with a secondary syphilitic serum, was used for additional transformations. Phage from plaqueTp3A were diluted and replated on E. coli CSH 18. When rescreened with three different secondary syphilitic sera, all Tp3A plaques produced autoradiograms showing positive radioactive reactions. Autoradiograms from control plaques of cloning Vector Charon 30 exhibited little or no radioactivity. This demonstrated that gene products from theTp3A transformed hosts were antigenic for antibodies in sera of syphilitic individuals. To further study the gene products from the Tp3A transformed hosts, a total protein lysate from the transformed hosts were submitted to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described in Example III. The differentiated polypeptides were then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose strips as described in Example I. The strips were coated with ovalbumin and incubated with syphilitic sera. Again, autoradiograms were prepared as described in 125Example I after the blots were exposed to 1 I labelled S. aureus protein A. FIGURE 19 is a photograph of an autoradiogram of a diagnostic strip of cloned treponemal antigenic peptides from Tp3A transformed hosts. Strip 1 is the differentiated peptide patterns from the transformed hosts following exposure to syphilitic sera. Strip 2 is a Charon 30 control.Strip 3 shows the total T. pallidum protein profile after exposure to syphilitic sera. Strip 4 is standard system of molecular weight markers. A comparison of strip 1 with strip 4 reveals thatTp3A genes code for at least five peptides of 41,000, 38,000, 23,000, 19,700, and 17,600 molecular weight which react specifically with syphilitic sera. The molecular weights of these cloned antigenic proteins correspond to the molecular weights of antigenic proteins of T. pallidum illustrated.in strip 3. Control strip 2 shows that lysate proteins obtained from Charon 30 transformed hosts do not react with syphilitic sera. This demonstrates that the treponemal antigenic proteins are coded for by the cloned T. pallidumDNA. Itrav bs seen, therefore, that the invention provides in one aspect a method of ciaaosing for the presence of a specific disease, a specific disease stage, or allergy in a patient by which a much higher accuracy may be obtained in a very short time. The invention opens the possibility of providing physicians, in their offices or in small laboratories, with the ability to provide quick diagnosis on the basis of a sample of a patients serum. Long waits and possible inaccuracies which are typical of many widely used clinical diagnosis techniques are eliminated. The technique of the invention is applicable to a wide variety of diseases or allergies, merely requiring an initial series of comparison tests to ascertain and develop the empirical information necessary to select the optimum group of antigenic components and the optimum differentiation process. Various modifications of the invention in addition to those shown and described herein will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description.Such modifications are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. In addition, the invention is not, of course, necessarily limited as an analysis tool to diagnosis.
