## Description
ATTRITION RESISTANT METAL OXYGEN COMPOSITIONS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField oN the Invention This invention relates to attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions and a process for preparing such compositions. More particularly, this invention relates to metal oxygen compositions comprising the infusion and reaction product of a a refractory material characterized by i a melting point of at least 15000 C, ii a mean particle size from about 10 pm to about 200 pm, and ii a fractional porosity of at least 0.2, and b at least one metal oxide, or compound con vertible by heat to such metal oxide, having a maximum mean particle size of about 100 pm, with the proviso that the refractory material metal oxide mean particle size ratio is at least 2, which metal oxide is susceptible of undergoing infusion and reaction with the refractory material upon being subjected to temperatures of at least 0.4 Tm for a time sufficient to cause infusion and reaction between the metal oxide and the refractory material, wherein Tm is the melting point in OK of the refractory material. The attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions of this invention may be used for any of a wide variety of purposes generally known in the art. Thus, for example, the compositions are useful in the transformation of numerous organic compounds in the vapor phase such as dehydrogenation reactions, oxidation reactions, hydrogenation reactions, isomerization reactions, dealkylation reactions, dehydrocoupling reactions, and the like. The compositions may be employed in a manner identical to that for metal oxygen compositions heretofore known in the art for such transformations. Descrifion of the Prior Art Supported metal oxides are well known as catalysts and oxygen carriers for a wide variety of chemical reactions. In general, such metal oxide com positions are comprised of a metal oxide coated dn a support material of low porosity and low surface area. Such support is commonly referred to as an ine rt support.The method generally employed to produce these supported metal oxide compositions involves impregnating the inert support with a solution of a soluble salt of the metal oxide, separating the resultant impregnated solid, and heating to remove a substantial portion of the solvent.The impregnated solid is then calcined at elevated temperatures to convert the metal salt to the correspond ing metal oxide. Multiple impregnations are sometimes employed to achieve an increased concentration of metal oxide on the support. Another well known technique employed for forming supported metal oxide compositions involves suspending the support materials in a solution of a salt of the metal, completely or partially evaporating the solvent, and possibly mixing the resultant material with an organic binder and pelletizing thereof. The dry pellet is then heated to an elevated temperature to effect complete dehydration and burning out of the organic material. A method for forming a supported metal oxide on a porous support is disclosed in U. S. Patent 3,925,447 which involves contacting the porous support material with the metal oxide in molten form to produce a catalyst in which the metal oxide is substantially entirely within the pores of the support. The resultant catalyst is used in the production of nitriles. U. S. Patent 3,668,151 discloses a high strength as indicated by its crush strength zinc aluminate catalyst composition. Upon being impregnated with platinum, lithium, and tin in the usual manner, the resultant catalyst was used to dehydrogenate n butane to olefins and diolefins, presumably 1 and 2 butene and 1,3 butadiene. A substantially identical zinc aluminate catalyst having an approximate mole ratio of zinc oxide to alumina of 1 also is disclosed in U. S. Patent 4,260,845. The catalyst is reported to be useful for dehydration of saturated alcohols to olefins, for example, 2 methyll butanol to 2 methyl l butene. Although these prior art compositions are generally suitable for their stated purposes, the commercial utility of catalysts and oxygen carrier compositions in reactions which involve reaction conditions of high stress such as high temperatures and or pressures, especially under fluidized bed conditions requires compositions which are highly resistant to abrasion and attrition due to the deleterious effects of reaction conditions. Accordingly, research efforts are continually being made for high efficiency catalyst and oxygen carrier compositions of increased physical strength and attrition resistance which are useful in reactions involving conditions of high stress. The discovery of the compositions of the present invention, therefore, is believed to be a decided advance in the catalyst and oxygen carrier composition art. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of this invention to provide attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions. Another object of this invention is to provide attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions highly effective for the vapor phase transformation of organic compounds. Yet another object of this invention is to provide attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions highly effective as combination catalyst oxygen carrier compositions in the vapor phase oxidative dehydrocoupling of toluene to yield toluene dehydrocoupled products in high yields and selectivities. Still another object of this invention is to provide a process for the preparation of attritiqn resistant metal oxygen compositions effective for the vapor phase transformation of organic compounds.

Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the accompanying description and claims. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 1. Tke C meosltions The attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions of the present invention comprise the infusion and reaction product of a a refractory material characterized by i a melting point of at least 15000 C, ii a mean particle size from about 10 pm to about 200 Vm, and iii a. fractional porosity of at least 0.2, and b at least one metal oxide, or compound convertible by heat to such metal oxide, having a maximum mean particle size of about 100 Vm, with the proviso that the refractory material metal oxide mean particle size ratio is at least 2, which metal oxide is susceptible of undergoing infusion and reaction with the refrac tory material upon being subjected to tempera tures of at least 0.4 T for a time m sufficient to cause infusion and reaction between the metal oxide and the refractory material, wherein Tm is the melting point in OK of the refractory material. The attrition resistant characteristics of the metal oxygen compositions of the present invention, preferably exhibiting an attrition rate less than 0.5 weight percent hour as measured by an accelerated attrition test described below , make them excellent for use in reactions which involve reaction conditions of high stress, particularly in a fluidized bed system at elevated temperatures and or pressures. The term infusion and related terms are employed herein to mean a process by which two adjacent solids of differing compositions homogenize by diffusion of one of such compositions into the other, for ,example, the diffusion of the metal oxide into the refractory material. The term fractional porosity is employed herein to mean the ratio of void space or volume in a particle to the bulk or total volume of that particle. The term attrition , as employed herein, means the art of wearing or grinding down by friction and breakage of the structures into dust and fines. The term attrition rate , as employed herein, means an accelerated attrition rate and refers to the rate of attrition as determined by an accelerated attrition test described in Example 44, below. The materials suitable for use as components of the metal oxygen compositions of this invention must, of necessity, possess those properties and characteristics which will yield attrition resistant compositions. In addition, the component materials advantageously should yield metal oxygen compositions which are suitable for the vapor phase transformation of organic compounds, especially the dehydrocoupling of toluene, to yield the desired products in high yields and selectivities. Such materials are available commercially from numerous catalyst and metal oxide suppliers. Refractory materials which are useful as components of the attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions are fairly wide in scope. Such materials, however, must possess certain characterizing properties to be suitable for use in the present invention. Included among such properties are a a meltirig point of at least 15000 C b a mean particle size from about 10 pm to about 200 pm, and preferably from about 20 m to about 125 pm and c a fractional porosity of at least 0.2, with values from about 0.2 to about 0.8 being preferred.In addition, it is preferred, although not required, that the refractory material have a su r.face area of at least 150 m2ig, a pore diameter such that a 0 least 10 percent of the poresare less than 55 A 5.5 nn , and in order to facilitate ease of fluidization, the refractory material particles preferably are spheroidal in shape. Nonlimiting examples of suitable refractory materials include alumina A1203 , silica SiO2 , silica alumina including natural and synthetic zeolites , barium oxide BaO , beryllia BeO , calcium oxide CaO , magnesium oxide CMgO , strontium oxide SrO , iron III oxide Fe2O3 , thoria ThO2 oxides of the lanthanides ìncluding lanthana La203 3 and oxides of metals ofGroup 4b of the Periodic Table of the Elements. Of the refractory materials listed, alumina is generally preferred, with,alumina that is predominantly in the gamma , delta 6 , eta , and chics crystal forms, and mixtures thereof, or that can be transformed by heat to these crystal forms, being most preferred. Included among the latter grouping are hydrated aluminas such as Boehmite, pseudo Boehmite, Bayerite, and Gibbsite. Metal oxides suitable for use within the scope of the present invention are not narrowly critical.Each metal oxide must, of necessity, be susceptible of undergoing infusion and reaction with the refractory materials under conditions hereinafter described to yield the attrition resistant metal oxygen composition.In addition, the metal oxide must have a maximum mean particle size of about 100 pm, with the proviso that the refractory material metal oxide mean particle size ratio is at least 2, and preferably 15 or more. The stated mean particle size ratio permits the metal oxide and the refractory material to undergo the desired infusion and reaction with little, if any, material change in the original particle size of the refractory material. This phenomenon results in the high strength attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions of this invent ion. Suitable metal oxides are exemplified by oxides of lithium CLi2O , sodium Na20 , potassium K2O , rubidium Rb2O , cesium Cs2O , of Group la beryllium BeO , magnesium CMgO , calcium CaO , strontium SrO , barium BaO of Group 2a scandium Sc203 , and yttrium CY203 of Group 3b zirconium ZrO2 of Group 4b vanadium V V2O5 of Group 5b zinc ZnO and cadmium CdO of Group 2b boron CB203 , gallium Ga203 , indium In2O3 , and thallium CT1203 of Group 3a germanium IV GeO2 , tin IV SnO2 , and lead II PbO of Group 4a phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth of Group 5a lanthanides actinides Groups lb, 6b, 7b, and.8 of thePeriodic Table of the Elements, and mixtures thereof. Of these metal oxides, the oxides of potassium, calcium, zirconium, iron, boron, lead, antimony, and bismuth, and mixtures thereof are preferred, especially for toluene dehydrocoupling reactions, bismuth oxide being most preferred. It will be noted, however, that while metal oxides are preferred for use in the present invention, the direct charging of metal oxides as starting materials is not necessary. Any compound of the desired metal such as salts, hydroxides, and the like, which are convertible by heat to the corresponding metal oxide, and as such, may be considered as a precursor thereof, may be used to provide indirectly the metal oxide for preparing the attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions of the present invention. Typical metal salts include the water soluble nitrates, carbonates, and acetates. The term Periodic Table of the Elements as employed herein refers to the Periodic Table of theElements published in CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 60th ed., Weast, Ed., CRC Press Inc., BocaRaton, Florida 1979, Inside Front Cover. Attention is drawn to the fact that in view of the listings of refractory materials and metal oxides suitable for use in the present invention, certain compounds may serve as either the refractory material or the metal oxide. Such compounds are suitably classified according to their mean particle size in conjunction with the ratio of their mean particle size to the remaining compound s .Since the refractory material is characterized by a mean particle size from about 10 pm to about 200 pm and the maximum mean particle size of the metal oxide is about 100 pm, and since the refractory material metal oxide mean particle size ratio must be at least 2, the compound having the larger mean particle size such that the required mean particle size ratio to that compound is at least 2 is classified as the refractory material and the remaining compound s is are classified as the metal oxide s . Conversely, the compounds having the smaller mean particle size such that the required mean particle size ratio is less than 2 is classified as the metal oxide. The metal oxide component ranges in an amount from about 20 mole percent to about 65 mole percent, based on the total number of moles of metal oxide and refractory material in the metal oxygen composition, and preferably from about 30 mole percent to about 55 mole percent. The refractory material component makes up the remaining portion of the metal oxygen composition, which, in view of the stated mole percent of the metal oxide component, must range from about 35 mole percent to about 80 mole percent. Preferably, however, the refractory material component constitutes from about 45 mole percent to about 70 mole percent of the metal oxygen composition. Refractory material concentrations greater and less than the stated 35 to 80 mole percent range, surprisingly, have been found to be detrimental.Compositions having refractory material concentrations outside the stated range 35 to 80 mole percent exhibit a marked decrease in attrition resistance, or stated differently, an increase in attrition rate.Lowered attrition resistance, of course, results in increased abrasion, breakage, and dusting of composition structures under high stress use conditions. Such abrasion, breakage, and dusting can cause undesirable pressure drop, flow problems, filter clogging, loss of fluidizability, and the like under such conditions, especially during operations employing fluidized bed reactor systems The attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions can be prepared in several ways.The simplest method involves intimately mixing at least one suitable metal oxide having a maximum mean particle size of about 100 Vm with the desired refractory material having a mean particle size from about 10 pm to about 200 pm such that the refractory material metal oxide mean particle size ratio is at least 2, in an amount sufficient to constitute from about 20 mole percent to about 65 mole percent of the composition. The metal oxide and refractory material components may be dry mixed or mixed by slurrying in a suitable wetting agent Cwet mixed , for example, water or an organic compound such as methanol, ethanol, and the like.When a wetting agent is employed in the mixing step, it is removed by heating the slurried mixture at a temperature and for a time sufficient to substantially remove the excess wetting agent. In general, heating at a temperature of about 1500 C to about 2500 C, usually about 2000 C, for about 1 hour to about 5 hours, usually 2 hours, is sufficient. It will be recognized, however, that the actual time and temperature will depend upon the particular wetting agent employed, the quantity of material, and the like. The dry mixed material may also be subjected to similar temperatures in order to remove any physically bound water. Continued heating of the dry mixture from either the wet mixed or drymixed compoments at temperatures from about 250 C to about 500 C about 1 hour to abuot 5 hours serves to decompose any salts which are present and remove other volatile components. Upon completion of the drying and removal of any other volatile components, the dry mixture of metal oxide and refractory material is calcined at a temperature of at least 0.4 T for a time sufficient m to cause the metal oxide and the refractory material to infuse in accordance with diffusional behavior in metal oxides as described in Freer, Journal of MaterialScience, 15, 803 824 1980 and undergo reaction to yield the attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions of the present invention. The calcination may be carried out in an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, helium, and the like, or in air. In many instances, it may be desirable to conduct the initial calcination under an inert atmosphere in order to prevent oxidation of the metal ion of the metal oxide to a higher oxidation state which may prevent or severely curtail the necessary infusion. This initial calcination is then followed by a final calcination in air to form the desired metal oxygen composition. As previously noted, the calcination is carried out by heating the dry mixture of metal oxide and re fractory material to a temperature of at least 0.4 T . m It will be recognized that the actual temperature employed will depend primarily on the melting point of the refractory material. Secondarily, the actual temperature may also depend upon the diffusional behavior of the metal oxide with the particular refractory material. In a similar manner, the actual time employed will depend upon the component materials employed, as well as the calcination temperature. As an example, when alumina, a preferred refractory material having a melting point of about 22730 K 20000 C , is employed, temperatures typically from about 8000 C 0.47 T to about 14000 C 0.74 T and a time m m from about 1 hour to about 15 hours are sufficient.Preferably, in such instances, a temperature from about 9000 C to about 11000 C and a time from about 8 hours to about 12 hours are emplyed, most preferably, a temperature from about 1000 C to about 1050 C and a time from about 10 hours to about 11 hours. The calcination and infusion may be effected in any calcination apparatus known to the art. Nonlimiting examples include ovens or muffle furnaces containing fixed beds or moving beds, rotary kilns, and the like. In an alternative method of preparation, a suitable precursor hydroxide or salt of the metal oxide component such as a nitrate, carbonate, or acetate is intimately mixed with the refractory material and infused and calcined as previously described. Another method involves the impregnation of the refractory material with an aqueous solution of one or more of the precursor salts. Preferably, a high concentration of metal salt is employed in order to minimize the need for subsequent evaporation of solvent. After the impregnation, the resultant product is subjected to the infusion and calcining process as previously described. 2. Characterization of the Compositions The attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions of this invention are substantially free of unreacted metal oxide and refractory material as determined by x ray diffraction XRD . That is, the starting material components, under the heating ,and or calcining conditions employed, have undergone infusion and reaction to an extent sufficient to preclude having the starting material components remain in an unreacted state. As a result, the compositions of the present invention are not simply active materials supported on a porous support material they, instead, are novel compositions comprising the infusion and reaction product of a refractory material and at least one metal oxide, all as previously defined. The compositions of this invention exhibit excellent attrition resistance when compared to supported catalysts and compositions of the prior art. An attrition rate less than 0.5 weight percent hour is, in general, preferred. In addition, the compositions demonstrate high activities, as well as high selectivities, in the many and varied transformations of organic compounds. In a preferred use embodiment, compositions prepared from oxides of lead, antimony, or bismuth, and mixtures thereof, and alumina have been found to be particularly efficacious as oxygen carriers and or catalysts in the dehydrocoupling of toluene to stilbene and or bibenzyl.Overall, and in general, metal and metal ions employed as catalysts in known prior art processes may be employed in the metal oxygen compositions of this invention in the same mode to effect similar reactions, but with the added advantage of increased attrition resistance. The attrition resistance, calculated as the attrition rate in units of weight percent hour is determined by an accelerated attrition test. In this test, which is described in detail in Example 44, below, the weight in grams of dust and fines generated via abrasion, friction, and breakage under stated conditions for a specified period of time, usually the 5 21 hour period 16 hours out of a total of 21 hours, from a specificed weight in grams of a sample of the bulk composition is measured.Using these values, the percent attrition during the specified period can be calculated as follows Attrition Dust and Fines 5 21 Hour Period , gWeight, g Dust and Fines 0 5 Hour Period , g g 100The attrition rate is then calculated as follows X Rate Attrition Attrition Rate Time Period, Hours It will be apparent, of course, that all things being equal with respect to properties exhibited by the metal oxygen compositions of this invention, the greater the attrition resistance expressed as a smaller numerical attrition rate value in units of weight percent hour , the more desirable such compositions become in that fewer difficulties associated with high rates of attrition lack of attrition resistance are experienced during use in reactions involving conditions of high stress.An attrition rate less than 0.5 weight percent hour, as previously noted, for the compositions of this invention is preferred, with values of 0.3 weight percent hour or less being most preferred. The specific surface area value desirable for a given metal oxygen composition depends primarily on its intended use. As an example, compositions useful in the dehydrocoupling of toluene preferably will exhibit surface area values less than 5 mê g, with values from about 0.05 m and m m2 g being most preferred.Such values result in greater activities and selectivities to the toluene dehydrocoupled products. Conversely, higher surface area compositions, especially those having surface areas greater than 5 m2 g, exhibit decreased selectivities to the toluene dehydrocoupled products as evidenced by the undesirable tendency toward increased benzene and carbon dioxide production during such dehydrocoupling reactions. The surface area of the metal oxygen compositions of this invention is measured according to the BET method Efrom Brunauer et al, Journal of the AmericanChemical Society, 60 309 319 1938 described in ASTM D 3663 78 using a Micromeritics Digisorb 2500 instrument.For samples having a relatively low surface area, for example, less than about 5 m g, krypton is preferably substituted for nitrogen as the adsorption gas for increased accuracy of measurement.3. Transformation of OrSanic Compounds The attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions otthis invention, as previously noted, are useful for the transformation of organic compounds in the vapor phase. For convenience and clarity, however, the use of the metal oxygen compositions will be described with reference to a process to oxidatively dehydrocouple toluene to produce toluene dehydrocoupled products, namely, stilbene and bibenzyl. As noted previously, such compositions preferably exhibit an attrition rate less than 0.5 weight percent hour and, for use in the toluene dehydrocoupling process herein described, a 2 surface area less than 5 m g. The attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions of this invention function in a catalytic mode, a stoichiometric mode as an oxidant or oxygen carrier, or a combined catalytic stoichiometric mode for the dehydrocoupling of toluene. In the catalytic mode of operation, oxygen or an oxygen containing gas such as air or oxygen enriched air is reacted with toluene in the presence of the attrition resistant metal oxygen composition in an amount sufficient for the dehydrocoupling reaction.In the stoichiometric mode of operation, the attrition resistant metal oxygen composition is the sole source of oxygen. That is, in the latter instance the dehydrocoupling of toluene is conducted in the substantial absence of added free oxygen such as would be obtained from air. In the combined catalytic stoichiometric mode of operation, oxygen or an oxygen containing gas is added as a reactant in a manner similar to that noted previously for the catalytic mode of operation. However, the amount of added oxygen is not sufficient for the dehydrocoupling reaction and the required additional oxygen must be supplied by the attrition resistant metal oxygen composition. Of these three modes of operation, the stoichiometric mode is generally preferred in that undesirable side reactions oxidative dealkylation, for Example, to produce benzene and carbon dioxide are substantially reduced. It will, of course, be recognized that in spite of the undesirability of producing benzene during the course of the toluene dehydrocoupling reaction, benzene is a valuable article of commerce. It is therefore highly desirable to recover the benzene values when substantial production thereof occurs. The recovery and purification of such benzene values may be accomplished by any standard method and means known to the art. The term dehydrocoupling and related terms are employed herein to mean the toluene molecules are coupled or dimerized with carbon carbon bond formation occurring between the methyl group carbons and the coupled molecules have lost either one or two hydrogen atoms from the methyl group of each toluene molecule. When two hydrogen atoms per molecule of toluene are lost, the carbon carbon bond at the coupling or dimerization site is unsaturated as by dehydrogenation. That is, stilbene is the product. On the other hand, bibenzyl, having a saturated carbon cprbon bond at the coupling site, is the product when only one hydrogen atom per molecule of toluene is lost. In general, the production of stilbene as the toluene dehydrocoupled product is preferred over the production of bibenzyl. This stated preference is due to the unsaturated character of stilbene as opposed to the saturated character of bibenzyl. And, as is well known in the art, the presence of the unsaturated olefinic carbon carbon double bond causes the stilbene to exhibit high reactivity, thereby facilitating its direct use as an organic intermediate in numerous organic syntheses. The toluene dehydrocoupling process using the attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions of this invention is conveniently carried out in an apparatus of the type suitable for carrying out chemical reactions in the vapor phase. It can be conducted in a single reactor or in multiple reactors using either a fixed bed, or a fluidized bed system to effect contacting of the reactant or reactants and the attrition resistant metal oxygen composition. In general, a fluidized bed system is preferred in that it advantageously possesses the ability to approach isothermal conditions during the course of the reaction process. Moreover, the attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions of this invention are particularly suited for use in a fluidized bed system due to the low attrition rate and small particle size mean particle size from about 10 pm to about 200 pm .It would be apparent, of course, that when using a fluidized bed system, fluid velocities linear gas velocities must be sufficient to maintain a uniform suspension of the particles of the attrition resistant metal oxygen composition, but insufficient to sweep the particles out of the reactor. Gas velocities in the range between about 1.52 cm sec 0.05 ft sec to about 91.44 cm sec 3.0 ft sec are usually sufficient, depending on factors such as the relative densities of the gas and solid, gas vicosity, the size and shape of the solid particles, the number of particles per unit volume bed density , the size and configuration of the reactor, and the like. Regardless of the particular type of reactor employed whether fixed bed, moving bed, or a fluidized bed system the reactant toluene will generally be heated and introduced to the reactor as a vapor. However, the reactant may be introduced to the reactor as a liquid and then vaporized. The oxidative dehydrocoupling reaction is carried out in the vapor phase and under the influence of heat. The temperature range under which the reaction can be carried out ranges frjom about 450 C tjo about 650 C and preferably is conducted at fraom about 500 C to about 6000 C, most preferably at about 5750 C. Pressure is not critical in the toluene dehydrocoupling process of this invention. The reaction may be carried out at subatmospheric, atmospheric, or superatmospheric pressures as desired. It will be generally preferred, however, to conduct the reaction at or near atmospheric pressure. Generally, pressures from about 2.53 x 10 pascals or Pa 0.25 atmosphere or atm to about 4.05 x 105 Pa 4.0 atm may be conveniently employed. The reaction time for the contact of the reactant with the attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions of this invention may be selected from a broad operable range which may vary from about 0.1 to about 60 seconds. The reaction time may be defined as the length of time in seconds which the reactant gases measured under reaction conditions are in contact with the attrition resistant metal oxygen composition in the reactor. The reaction time may vary depending upon the reaction temperature and the desired toluene conversion level. At higher temperatures and lower toluene conversion levels, shorter contact times are required.Generally, the contact time will vary from about 0.5 seconds to about 20 seconds. Preferably, for optimum conversion and selectivity in the preferred temperature range, a contact time from about 1 second to about 12 seconds is employed. In addition to the toluene, other inert substances such as nitrogen, helium, and the like may be present in the reactor. Such inert materials may be introduced to the process alone or may be combined with the other materials as feed. Water or steam may be added to the reaction zone, preferably being introduced with the feed in order to improve the selectivity to the desired product s and particularly to suppress complete oxidation to CO2. Steam hydrocarbon mole ratios in the range from about 0.1 to about 10 or more are suitable, t he upper limit being determined by practical cost considerations. Mole ratios in the range from about 0.5 to about 3 are preferred. The attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions of this invention contain oxygen in such a manner that they are capable of releasing stoichiometric quantities of oxygen under the oxidative reaction conditions employed to dehydrocouple the toluene,as described. hereinbelow. The oxygen in the compositions is associated with the metals as oxides, as oxygen complexes, or as mixtures of oxides and complexes. As previously noted, the dehydrocoupling reaction may be conducted in the presence or absence of added free oxygen. When oxygen is not added to the system, that is, the reaction is conducted in the stoichiometric mode of operation, the oxygen required for the reaction is provided by the metal oxygen composition which enters into the reaction and is consequently reduced or, in actual practice, partially reduced during the course of the reaction. This necessitates regeneration or reoxidation which can be easily effected by heating the material in air or oxygen at temperatures from about 5000 C to about 6500 C for a period of time ranging from about 5 seconds to about 1 hour.In a semi continuous operation, regeneration can be effected by periodic interruption of the reaction for reoxidation of the reduced composition, that is, periods of reaction are cycled with periods of regeneration. Operation, however, can be on a continuous basis whereby a portion of the attrition resistant metal oxygen composition can be continuously or intermittently removed, reoxidized, and the reoxidized material can thereafter be continuously or intermittently returned to the reaction. The latter method is particularly adapted to operations in which the attrition resistant metal oxygen composition is employed in the form of a moving bed or the preferred fluidized bed. When oxygen is employed as a reactant, the reaction may be conducted in either a catalytic mode of operation or a combined catalytic stoichiometric mode of operation, depending on the amount of oxygen supplied. In the catalytic mode of operation, oxygen is supplied in an amount sufficient for the dehydrocoupling reaction. The actual amount of oxygen supplied may be specified as a function of the amount of the toluene. On this basis, the amount of oxygen supplied is ordinarily selected to provide a toluene oxygen mole ratio from about 1 to about 8 and preferably from about 2 to about 6. In the combined catalytic stoichiometri c mode of operation, the amount of oxygen supplied as a reactant is not sufficient for the dehydrocoupling reaction, thereby requiring an additional source of oxygen. The required additional oxygen will be supplied by the attrition resistant metal oxygen composition, that is, the composition will serve as the additional source of oxygen. As a result, the attrition resistant metal oxygen composition enters into the reaction and is consequently reduced during the course of the reaction.This necessitates regeneration or reoxidation of the reduced pomposition which can be easily effected as described previously for the stoichiometric mode of operation. In either mode of operation employing added oxygen as a reactant, whether catalytic or combined catalytic stoichiometric, the added free oxygen may be supplied either as oxygen or an oxygen containing gas such as air or oxygen enriched air. As previously indicated, the toluene dehydrocoupling process employing the attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions of this invention is preferably carried out in the absence of added free oxygen, that is, in the stoichiometric mode of operation, and utilizes only that oxygen supplied by the attrition resistant metal oxygen composition. Also, with few exceptions, at substantially comparable conditions,the lower the toluene conversion level, the higher will be the selectivity to the dehydrocoupled products. That is, under similar conditions, he selectivity to the dehydrocoupled toluene product is in general inversely proportional to the toluene conversion level. However, for practical reasons, the dehydrocoupling reaction will generally be conducted at a toluene conversion level of about 20 to about 55 percent. The toluene dehydrocoupled products, stilbene and bibenzyl, may be recovered and purified by any appropriate method and means known to the art and further elucidation here will be unnecessary duplication of the art. As noted previously stilbene, of course, is the preferred product. The following specific examples illustrating the best presently known methods of practicing the invention are described in detail in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the invention. It should be understood, however, that the detailed expositions of the application of the invention, while indicating preferred embodiments, are given by way of illustration only and are not to be construed as limiting the invention since various changes and modifications within the spirit of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.

EXAMPLES 2 43General A series of attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions were prepared by intimately mixing the appropriate quantities of at least one metal oxide and a refractory material, heating to a temperature and for a time sufficient to remove any added wetting agent and physically bound water, as well as other volatile components, and calcining the mixture. The calcined material was cooled under controlled cool down conditions and sieved to the size of the original refractory material.The retained material accounted for greater than 90 weight percent of the calcined metal oxygen composition. The metal oxygen compositions were further characterized as described in Examples 44 accelerated attrition rate and 45 transformation of organic compounds, with the dehydrocoupling of toluene being used for illustrative purposes. EXAMPLES 2 10 The following is a general procedure for the preparation of a metal oxygen composition using a wetting agent wet mixing process and alumina as the refractory material and containing bismuth, calcium, and zirconium. To a suitably sized wide mouthed, polyethylene jar was added appropriate quantities of bismuth III oxide Bi203 , calcium oxide CaO , and zirconium IV oxide ZrO2 , all as powders, and a sufficient number of suitably sized alumdum balls C6 8 1.9 centimeter 0.75inch diameter for a 4.4 liter l gallon, dry jar. The jar was placed on a ball mill and the contents ball milled for 6 hours. The thoroughly mixed metal oxide powders and a sufficient quantity of the triply sieved alumina in accordance with the procedure described inExample 1 above were placed in a second suitably sized wide mouthed, polyethylene jar without the alumdum balls. The alumina metal oxides mole percent ratio was approximately 55 45. The jar was shaken by hand for 5 minutes and then rotated on a ball mill for 3 hours. The resultant mixture was passed through a 100 mesh U. S. StandardSieve Size screen to insure mixing. Any clumps remaining on the screen were broken up and passed through the screen. The sieved mixture was returned to the jar and rotated on the ball mill an additional 3 hours if any clumps remained on the screen after sieving, or, in the absence of any remaining clumps, for only 0.5 hour to break up any stratification of powders resulting from sieving. To the dry mixed components was added sufficient water, with stirring by hand, to form a thixotropic paste. The paste was placed in suitably sized fused alumina crucibles containing less than 0.2X silica to a maximum depth of 7.62 centimeters 3.0 inches . The loaded crucibles were placed in an air purged furnace.The furnace was heated to 150 250 C, usually 200 C, which temperature was maintained for 1 hour to 5 hours, usually 5 hours, to remove the excess wetting agent. The temperature was then increased to 1000 C ata rate of 120 C per hour slow heat up . Calcination was continued at 10000 C for about 10 hours. After the calcination was complete, the metal oxygen composition was cooled to 7000 C under controlled conditions at a maximum cool down rate of 1500 C per hour. Thereafter, the cool down was continued at its natural rate to ambient temperature. The cooled, lightly agglomerated metal oxygen composition was crushed and sieved for 30 minutes to complete the breakdown of the soft agglomerations to 120 400, 70 325, or 70 200 mesh particles, depending upon which corresponds to the original particle size of the alumina starting material. The retained material had a uniformly yellow color. The parameters for such compositions are set forth in Table 2, below. EXAMPLES 11 19 The following is a general procedure for the preparation of a metal oxygen composition in the absence of a wetting agent dry mixing process and using alumina as the refractory material and containing lead, antimony, and bismuth. The procedure described above for the wet mixing process Examples 2 10 was employed through the dry mixing steps using appropriate quantities of lead II oxide PbO , antimony III oxide Sb203 , bismuth III oxide Bi203 , and alumina. The alumina metal oxides mole percent ratio was 51.3 48.7. The thoroughly mixed components were placed in suitably sized fused alumina crucibles containing less than 0.2 silica and compacted to insure close physical contact. The maximum depth of loading was 7.62 centimeters 3.0 inches to permit air to diffuse the material located at the bottom of the crucible during the air calcination. The loaded crucibles were placed in a nitrogen purged furnace. The furnace, under a constant nitrogen purge, was heated to 150 2500 C, usually 2000 C, which temperature was maintained for 1 hour to 5 hours, usually 2 hours, to remove any physically bound water. The temperature was then increased to 10000 C over a l hour period rapid heat up in order to delay the oxidation of antimony III oxide to antimony V oxide until the air calcinfation period.Calcination was continued at 1000 C under a nitrogen purge for about 1 hour. The furnace atmosphere was changed to air and calcination continued under an air purge for an additional 9 hours. The calcined metal oxygen composition, a uniformly burnt orange color, was then treated as described in Examples 2 10, above. The parameters for such compositions are set forth inTable 2, below. EXAMPLES 20 34 The following illustrates the preparation of a number of metal oxygen compositions containing a number of different elements.

EXAMPLE 44 This Example illustrates the accelerated attrition test used to determine attrition rate of the attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions of this invention. The apparatus used to determine attrition rate is described in Houdry Catalyst 8brochure, Air Products and Chimicals, Inc., FCC Calysr Retention is Better with Houdry HFZTm HEZTm Catalysts , 1977. It consisted of a stainless steel tube 69.85 centimeters 27.5 inches in length and 3.81 centimeters 1.5 inches in inside diameter connected through a cone C10.16 centimeter 4 inch rise3 to a stainless steel tube 45.72 centimeters 18 inches in length and 12.7 centimeters 5 inches in inside diameter which had a flanged opening at the upper end. The upper end was capped with a 0.64 centimeter 0.25 inch thick stainless steel plate having a tubular opening in the center 3.81 centimeters 1.5 inches in length and 0.95 centimeter 0.38 inch in inside diameter. The plate was bolted onto the flange through eight 0.48centimeter 0.19 inch diameter holes machined into its outer perimeter and sealed with a neoprene gasket.Attached to the center tube opening was a 250 milliliteP filter flask, which had an extraction thimble attached to its side arm. A perforated stainless steel plate containing three equally spaced 0.041 centimeter 0.016inch diameter holes was located at the bottom of the stainless steel tube. Connected to the bottom of the stainless steel tube was air inlet means containing pressure regulators and flow controllers. The filter flask and the extraction thimble assembly was conditioned by passing humidified air through it for 30 minutes and then weighed. A sample of the composition from Examples 2 43 was screened using a 125 400 mesh sieve CU. S. Standard Sieve Size to remove any dust and fines. A 50 milliliter sample the screened composition was accurately weighed and charged to the apparatus described above.Humidified air was introduced through the perforated plate at the bottom of the stainless steel tube at a linear velocity of about 3.048 x 104 cm sec 1 x 103 ft sec to fluidize the composition. After 5 hours, the flask and thimble assembly first flask and thimble assembly was replaced with another conditioned flask and thimble assembly second flask and thimble assembly . The first flask and thimble assembly was weighed to determine the weight in grams of dust and fines associated with weak particles, dust, and trash already present in the composition. The fluidizaton was continued for an additional 16 hours for a total of 21 hours. At the end of this period, the second f Last and thimble assembly was weighed to determine the weight in grams of dust and fines resulting from attrition during the prolonged fluidization. The attrition rate, as weight percent hour, was calculated as follows Attrition Dust Fines 5 21 Hr.

EXAMPLE 45 A. loluene Conversion React 0 A fluidized bed re actor was employed unless otherwise noted, in which case a fixed bed reactor was employed. 1 Fluidized eg A stainless steel tube 38.1 centimeters 15 inches in length and 1.27 centimeters 0.5 inch outside diameter was employed as a fluidized bed reactor for the toluene conversion reaction. The tube was capped on the bottom by a conical section that had a 300 angle. The reactor was arranged vertically and equipped at the lower end with reactant inlet means for introducing the feed materials. The inlet means was fitted with a porous metal frit for gas dispersion. The reactor was equipped at the upper end with reaction effluent outlet means fitted with a 90 llm filter, for collecting the effluent or, alternatively, for direct introduction thereof via a gas sampling valve into a gas liquid chromatograph for analysis. A radiant furnace divided into two compartments, an upper compartment and a lower compartment, was used as a heat source throughout the reaction period. The lower compartment maintained a constant temperature in the reaction zone while the upper compartment maintained a lower, albeit constant, tempera ture approximately 4500 C in the gas ex pansion zone. The temperature was measured with a thermocouple in a temperature well positioned inside the length of the reactor. 2 Fixed Bed A stainless steel tube 20.32 centimeters 8 inches in length and 0.95 centimeter 0.375 inch in internal diameter having a usable capacity of 11 milliliters was employed as a fixed bed reactor for the toluene conversion reaction. The reactor was arranged vertically and equipped at the upper end with reactant inlet means having calibrated flow controllers and vaporizers, and at the lower end with r e action effluent outlet means for collecting the reaction effluent or, alternatively, for direct introduction thereof via a gas sampl ing valve into a gas liquid chromatograph for analysis. The outlet means was also equipped with means for introducing an inert gas diluent nitrogen or helium, for ex ample into the reaction effluent for analysis purposes. A radiant furnace was used to maintain a constant temperature during the reaction period.The temperature was measured with a thermocouple in a temperature well located on the lower out side wall of the reactor.B. Toluene Conversion The reaction was conducted in a stoichiometric mode of operation under fluidized conditions unless otherwise noted. 1 fluidized Bed The reactor was charged with approximately 15 milliliters of the attrition resistant metal oxygen composition prepared as described in Examples 2 43, above. The reactor was placed in the two compartment radiant furnace and heated to the operating temperatures, usually 575 C for the reaction zone and 450 C for the gas expansion zone, which temperatures were maintained throughout the reaction period. The reactor was operated at a pressure of 2.53 x 105 pascals 2.5 atmospheres, 36.7 psia in a four step cycle which comprised a passing a stream of air through the attrition resistant metal oxygen composition for a period of time ranging from 5 seconds to 1 hour, usually 30 minutes composition oxidation or regeneration b purging the system with a 1 2 mole ratio feed mixture of nitrogen and water for 1 minute purge c feeding a toluene water mixture having a 1 2 mole ratio through the system for 3 minutes toluene dehydrocoupling or composition reduction and d purging the system as in step b purge . The cycle was then repeated.The total molar feed rate during each step of the four step cycle was maintained at 15 17 millimoles minute about 557 cc minute flow rate which, under reaction conditions, provided a linear gas velocity of about 8.23 centimeter second 0.27 ft. sec. and a superficialreactor residence contact time of about 4 seconds unless specified otherwise. Samples of the reaction effluent were taken at 30 second intervals for analysis by gas liquid chromatography. The results, integrated over the 3 minute dehydrocoupling step c period, are tabulated in Table 3. 2 Fixed Bed The reactor was charged with approximately 11 milliliters of the attrtion resistant metal oxygen composition prepared as described in Examples 2 43, above. Glass wool plugs were used as supports for the composition. The charged reactor was placed in a radiant furnace and heated to maintain a constant temperature throughout the reaction period. Steam and toluene in a 2 1 mole ratio were fed to the reactor at a pressure of 2.53 x 105 pascals 2.5 atmospheres, 36.7 psi a at a rate sufficient to provide a reactor residence contact time of 3 seconds unless otherwise noted for the toluene a assuming a 50X void space in the reactor .After the reaction had proceeded for 1 minute, the reaction effluent, diluted with helium, was analyzed by gas liquid chromotography.

Flash distill the combined streams to a 2000 C bottoms temperature and then batch distill through a 2.5 centimeter inside diameter x 90.0 centimeter long column packed with extruded metal. Collect the fraction having a boiling point at about 1860 C 20 mm mercury as trans stilbene. The stilbene product is a white, crystalline solid having a melting point of 124 125 C and a retention time identical with an authentic sample of trans stilbene as determined by gas chromatographic coin j ect ion. Molten trans stilbene reacts rapidly with atmospheic oxygen to form numerous oxygenated or polar impurities, a major constituent of which is benzophenone. As a result, molten trans stilbene should be protected from exposure to the atmosphere. Transstilbene so contaminated can be purified by recrystallization from 95 ethanol to yield pure product Thus, it is apparent that there has been provided, in accordance with the present invention, attrition resistant metal oxygen compositions, a process for preparing same, and a process for utilizing such compositions to transform organic compounds, for example, to dehydrocouple toluene to yield toluene dehydrocoupled products, that fully satisfy the objects and advantages set forth hereinabove. While the invention has been described with respect to various specific examples and embodiments thereof, it is understood that the invention is not limited thereto and that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description.Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the spirit and broad scope of the invention.
