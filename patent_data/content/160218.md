# Process for preparing C8 C24 alkylbenzene sulfonylazides.

## Abstract
A two step process for the production of C₈ C₂₄ alkylben zenesulfonylazides. In the first step, C₈ C₂₄ alkylbenzenesulfonic acids, in a suitable nonreactive, water immiscible solvent, are reacted with an excess of a reactive chlorinating agent, in the presence of a suitable solvent capable of forming a Vilsmeier reagent, at about 40 to about 70 C, to form the corres ponding sulfonyl chlorides C₈ C₂₄ alkylbenzenesulfonyl chlorides . In the second step, the sulfonyl chlorides, still in the presence of the same solvent, are converted to the azides by reaction with aqueous sodium azide, in the presence of a anion transfer phase transfer catalyst.

## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION PROCESS FOR PREPARING C8 C24ALKYLBENZENE SULFONYLAZIDESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 4 Dodecylbenzenesulfonylazides p azidosulfonyldodecylbenzenes were disclosed inU.S. Patent 4,284,575 and have proven to be useful as diazo transfer reagents, such as in the following EMI1.1 Tr iethylanine wherein Ra and R are, inter alia, alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclic, aralkyl, lower alkoxy, and alkylthio and EMI2.1 In reaction efficiency, 4 dodecylbenzenesulfonylazides compare fav6rably with conventionally known diazo transfer reagents, but offer the significant safety advantages of shock stability and nonexplosiveness Hazen et al., Synth. Corm., 1981, 11, 947 . In contrast, certain other azide diazo transfer reagents, including the videly used p tosylazide p toluenesulfonylazide , are shock sensitive and explosive, In fact, p tosylazide has the shock sensitivity of tetryl and the explosive power of TNT, and two explosions have been reported during its preparation. aowever, the process for preparing 4 dodecylbenzenesulfonylazides which was disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,284,575 includes a number of problems.The two step process of that reference involves reacting dodecylbenzenesulfonic acids with phosphorus oxychloride at 1050C, then isolating the sulfonyl chlorides as an oil and reacting then with sodium azide in acetone at 25 C, in order to convert it to the azide. This process includes a troublesome, but necessary, qnench after the first reaction step, plus an elaborate and time consuming series of extractions and back extractions of the dodecylbenzenesulfonylchlorides in ethyl acetate layer. Then, acetone must replace the ethyl acetate An, the solvent for the second step, and an excess of solid sodium azide, which is insoluble in acetone, must be used for the conversion reaction.This use of excess sodium azide for the conversion reaction results in a sodium chloride cake, contaminated with sodium azide, which must be disposed of, and the resulting azide solution must be purified on silica gel, with the use of large volumes of solvents. Finally. the azide solution must be concentrated, which is always a potential hazard, despite its decreased sensitivity. For all these troubles, there is only a 72 yield of 4 dodecylbenzenesulfonylazides by this process. Consequently, it is an object of the present invention to develop an improved process for the synthesis of C8 C24 alkylbenzenesulfonylazides, particularly p dodecylbenzenesulfonylazides, which is safe, convenient and offers a high yield.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The instant invention is directed to a new, simple, and high yielding process for the production of C C8 C24alkylbenzenesulfonylazides, EMI3.1 wherein R is a C8 C24 alkyl group, preferably dodecyl. The process according to this invention comprises two steps. In the first step, C8 C24 alkylbenzenesulfonic acids, in a suitable nonreactive, water immiscible solvent such as a hydrocarbon or chlorinated solvent which is compatible with a reaLive chlorinating agent, such as thionyl chloride, e.g., hexane, toluene, methylene chloride, and like solvents, preferably hexane , are reacted with an excess of a reactive chlorinating agent, such as thionyl chloride, phosphoryl chloride, phosgene and other agents suitable for forming acid chlorides, particularly thionyl chloride, in the presence of a suitable solvent capable of forming a Vilsmeier reagent, such solvents including dimethylformamide, n alkyl pyrrolidinone or n formyl piperidine, preferably dimethylformamide, at about 400 to about 700C, preferably about 700C, to form the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides C8 C24alkylbenzenesulfonyl chlorides . The hexane layer is then washed with sodium bicarbonate to remove any remaining C8 Cz4alkylbenzenesulfonic acids.In the second step the sulfonyl chlorides, still in the presence of the same solvent, are converted to the azides by reaction with aqueous sodium azide, in the presence of a anion transfer phase transfer catalyst such as quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts, including benzyltriethyl ammonium chloride, tetra n butyl ammonium chloride, cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, or particularly AliquatR 336 tri n alkylmethyl ammonium chloride a mixture of C8 and C10 chains, with Cs predominating from General MillsChemicals, Inc. macrocyclic or Macrobicyclic crown ethers triazine ethers or N alkyl phosphoramides EMI5.1 Hexane Aliquat 336 700 wherein Rlg 2 EMI5.2 with R representing a C8 C24 alkyl group. By the use of this new phase transfer catalysis method, troublesome solvent changes are avoided and the hexane solution of sulfonylazides may be isolated without hazardous concentration.Further, the use of a significant excess of sodium azide is eliminated, as the driving force for the bimolecular reaction is provided by the phasetransfer reaction, and overall, the work up is much simpler and reaction times are significantly reduced from those required under the previous methods. The following example further illustrates the process of the instant invention, without limiting it. EXAMPLE 1A.
