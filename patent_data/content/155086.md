# Method and apparatus for pressure molding firebrick.

## Abstract
The mixture is being held under pressure and an additional vibratory motion is exerted by alternately directed hydraulic fluid at rapid intervals. In a preferred embodiment, the selec tive delivery of the pressurized fluid to the fluid chambers of the press is controlled by a servomechanism, constantly comparing a reference pressure signal with an actual pressure signal representative of the actual pressure being exerted by the press and actuating a servovalve so as to make the differ ence between the reference and actual pressure signals zero.
