# Programmable video display generator.

## Abstract
A video display system is provided having a programmable video display generator. The video display generator is divided into a control unit and an interface unit. The control unit has a dedicated display address generator which frees up the micro processor used in the video display system. The system is capable of operation with several different microprocessors as well as with different types of random access memories. Circuitry within the interface unit advises the system of the type of microprocessor being used as well as the type of random access memory. The interface unit controls character generation as well as final attribute circuitry which gives the video display generator a high degree of capability while minimizing the amount of circuitry required.
