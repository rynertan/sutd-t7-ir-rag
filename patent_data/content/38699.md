# Improvements in power operated boosters.

## Abstract
A booster for a vehicle braking system has an input piston 3 , a boost piston 6 and an output piston working in a bore 2 , the boost piston 6 being advanced in the bore 2 in response to pressure fluid frome a source pressurising a boost chamber 5 under control of valve means. The operation of the valve means is dependent on the pressure in the system, and the valve means has a valve mechanism 20 working in a bore 22 in the boost piston 6 of which one part 50 has a pressure responsive face, the valve means being operative, on initial movement of the input piston 3 to cause pressurisation of the braking system to a threshold level, and application of pressure fluid to the pressure responsive face to move the part 50 relative to the input piston 3 to place the boost chamber 5 in communica tion with the pressure source. Threshold pressurisation of the braking system may be achieved by pressurisation of the boost chamber 5 , or an auxiliary chamber forward of the boost piston 6 to a predetermined level.
