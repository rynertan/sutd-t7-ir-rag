## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONCARBON MOLECULAR SIEVES AND A PROCESS FOR THEIRPREPARATIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Carbon molecular sieves are porous substriates with an open network structure of controlled molecular dimension which may be used to separate mixtures of small molecular gases or liquids from larger molecular sized gases or liquids based on a difference in molecular size or a difference in diffusivity rates. See for example, Grant, U.S.Patent No. 3,884,830 and references cited therein. Carbon molecular sieves need not be activated carbons. Activated carbons are carbonaceous substrates which have been subjected to an activating agent, such as steam, carbon dioxide, oxidizing agents and the like. Carbon molecular sieves have been prepared from a variety of substrates by a number of different manufacturing processes. See for example, Mason et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,222,412, employing anthracite coal, elevated temperatures and an inert atmosphere Munzner et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,801,513, employing coke or coconut shells, elevated temperatures and pore blocking by carbon deposition Yuki, U.S. PatentNo. 4,046,709 employing vinylidene chloride copolymers and elevated temperatures and Vesterdal,U.S. Patent No. 2,556,859 employing bituminous coal or coconut shells, elevated temperatures and an inert atmosphere. Carbon molecular sieves have generally been prepared in an externally fired rotary kiln or other similar batch type furnace. The major difficulties associated with the noncontinuous batch type manufacture of carbon molecular sieves are 1 the difficulty of maintaining furnace atmospheric and temperature limits for the control of sieve pore diameter and 2 the product variability from batch to batch, i.e., quality control. See Munzner et al.,U.S. Patent No. 3,962,129. Carbon molecular sieve average effective pore diameters are generally governed by the following factors A furnace temperature B furnace atmosphere C residence time D presence or absence of a pore blocking substanceControl of the first two conditions has been a major problem associated with the prior art noncontinuous, batch type manufacturing processes. The use of a continuous feed type heating means, as described herein, overcomes the difficulties associated with atmosphere and temperature control of noncontinuous, batch processes, thereby assuring pore diameter selection and overall sieve quality control. The instant process also generates carbon sieves with better selectivity and capacity values than prior art batch processes. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The FIG. is a schematic diagram of the system employed herein for the continuous manufacture of carbon molecular sieves.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A process for continuously manufacturing carbon molecular sieves which comprises heating a charred substrate at a minimum temperature of 9000F for at least 5 minutes in a continuous manner and continuously collecting the sieves thus produced is described. The invention is also directed to novel carbon molecular sieves.DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention is directed to a process for the manufacture of carbon molecular sieves. The novel process of this invention preferably involves the steps of continuously feeding a charred substrate to a means for heating said substrate and heating said substrate under oxygen free conditions, without the use of an externally added pore blocking substance, at a temperature range of about 482or to 1093 for a time period of about 5 minutes to 90 minutes. Carbon molecular sieves of from 2 to 15 Angstrom pore diameter may be produced by this process. The novel carbon molecular sieves of this invention have an average effective pore diameter of about 4 Angstroms. The terms externally added pore blocking substance as used herein, refer to those substances recognized in the art as deposits applied to a carbon substrate prior to or during heating to constrict the substrate micropores. See, for example, U.S. PatentNos. 3,801,513 3,222,412 2,761,822 Canadian PatentNo. 608,038 and Great Britian Patent Specification No. 1,138,307. In each of these references, the micropores of the carbon substrate are constricted by some added material. These materials may be solids, liquids or gases which may be subsequently carbonized by heating to leave pure carbon constricting the micropores of the substrate. The terms oxygen free as used herein refer to a furnace atmosphere having a maximum oxygen content of 500 ppm, preferably 100 ppm or less, by volume prior to and during the manufacture of the carbon sieves. The terms charred substrate refer to those non cokable or decoked materials useful for preparing carbon molecular sieves by the process described herein. Typical non cokable substrates include, coconut char, babassu nut char, anthracite, high ranking bituminous coals and other non cokable substrates recognized in the art. Decoked substrates include oxidized decoked medium volatile bituminous and lignite coals and other decoked substrates recognized in the art. The charred substrate is generally crushed and screened to the desired mesh size. Mesh size is not a critical factor. U.S. Sieve sizes of from 3 X 6 to 50 X 100 may be employed. For nut chars the mesh size generally used was 8 X 30 U.S. Sieve. The substrates, especially those made from coal may require agglomeration. Agglomeration techniques are adequately described in U.S. Patent No. 3,884,830.Following agglomeration, the substrates may be sized and screened as desired. Carbon molecular sieve average effective pore diameters are generally governed by the following factors A furnace temperature B furnace atmosphere C residence time D presence or absence of a pore blocking substance.In the present invention the control of pore diameter determinative factors was achieved by modifying the heating time, temperature and atmosphere processing conditions. A preferred heating means for carrying out this invention is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,050,900 and 3,648,630 which are herein incorporated by reference. Other heating means that may prove useful in the instant process include indirectly fired rotary kilns, the Selas type indirectly fired or electrically fired screw conveyor kiln or some of the various types of metal treating furnaces e.g.,Lindberg known in the art as modified for continuous type processing. The preferred system consists of a feed assembly, the heating means, and a product cooling section see the FIG. . Air locks are located between the feed assembly and the heating means and on the discharge end of the product cooling section.A preferred heating means is an electrically fired continuous transport type furnace having two independently controLled hot zones. Each hot zone contains silicon carbide infrared glow bars controlled by centrally located chromel alumel thermocouples. The furnace atmosphere is maintained in an oxygen free condition during the manufacturing process by purging of the system with an oxygen free inert gas such as nitrogen. Purging may be accomplished by either cocurrent or countercurrent inert gas flow relative to substrate feed flow. Countercurrent purging is preferred. Off gases containing combustible components are destroyed in an afterburner. The system backpressure is controlled by means of a valve located in the stack between the furnace and the afterburner. In conducting the instant process the furnace was initially brought to the desired temperature under an inert gas purge. Belt speed was set to adjust furnace residence time. The furnace generally reached a steady state in 6 to 8 hours and then feed was begun. Decoked or non coking substrate was fed through the system under a blanket of inert gas thereby producing carbon molecular sieves.Completion of a furnace run was accomplished by turning the feed system off and clearing the furnace. Process conditions for producing sieves having average effective pore diameters of from 2 to 15 Angstroms were as follows Range Preferred A temperature 4820C to 10930C 7500C to 10380c B residence time 5 to 90 min. 5 to 30 min. C feed rate 6.8 to 27.2 kg hr 13.6 to 22.7 kg hr D N2 purge rate 15 to 35 SCFM 20 to 30 SCFM If the furnace temperature was adjusted, about one to two hours was generally required for the furnace to equilibrate. Furnace temperature and residence time were found to be inversely related.Long residence times coupled with low temperatures produced sieves similar to those manufactured at high temperatures with shorter residence times. To be effective as a molecular sieve, the product must have 1 a high selectivity ratio and 2 a high capacity value. The terms selectivity and capacity refer to diffusivity characteristics of a molecular sieve.Gas diffusivity refers to the speed with which a gas sample passes into or out of the pores of a particular molecular sieve. Selectivity is defined as the ratio of two gas diffusivity values. A high selectivity value indicates that the sieve readily discriminates between gas mixture components based on both kinetic and thermodynamic factors. A high capacity value indicates that a small amount of molecular sieve will adsorb a large volume of. gas. The novel carbon molecular sieves of the present invention have the following physical characteristics Range Preferred A oxygen diffusivity 500 900 650 750 X 10 8 cm sec2 B oxygen nitrogen 6.5 8 5 7.0 7.5 selectivity ratio C oxygen capacity 6.00 8.00 same cc g D oxygen capacity 4.00 6.00 same cc cc E apparent density O.60 0.70 0.64 0.70 g cc F average effective pore diameter about 4 Angstroms. The following examples democstrate the process for preparing novel carbon molecular sieves from sized 8 X 30 U.S. Sieve Phillipine coconut char Montenegro having an apparent density of about 0.61 g cc. Process conditions were as follows Range Preferred A temperature 9270C to 10930C 9820C to 10380C B residence time 5 to 90 min. 15 to 30 min. C feed rate 6.8 to 27.2 kg hr 13.6 to 22.7 kg hr O N2 purge rate 424.7 to 991.1 707.9 to 991.1 dm3 min dm3 min While these examples are directed to a preferred embodiment, it is expected that other non coking or decoked substrates will produce a carbon molecular sieve having the characteristics described herein when employing process parameters similar to those described herein. The following examples merely illustrate the present invention. They are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any manner. EXAMPLE 1 Coconut char was fed to the furnace at 30 pounds per hour. The furnace temperature was 18000F and the furnace residence time was 30 minutes. A constant nitrogen purge was maintained at 25 standard cubic feet per minute 707.9 dm3 min To calculate a test gas e.g., oxygen, nitrogen, etc. diffusivity value the dead volume of a sample cell containing about 10 grams of carbon sieve was determined by helium expansion. The test gas was then expanded into the reevacuated sample cell from a one liter reference cell. Knowing the dead volume, adsorption loading of any test gas was monitored by the change in pressure of the system.These values combined with an equilibrium loading value calculated for a sieve sample after one hour at STP allowed the determination of a relative loading value Lt Le . Lt was the test gas loading value of a sieve sample at a given time, for example 30 seconds, and Le was the test gas loading value of a sieve sample at equilibrium.The gas diffusivity value 0 of a sieve sample was then calculated for the test gas by solving the simplified equation for diffusion into a sphere 2 2 Lt Le 6 Ot t R2 3Dt R2 where D gas diffusivity value t time in seconds Rg mean particle radius of a carbon sieve 0.05125 cm See Dedrick, R.L. and Beckmann, R. a., Kinetics ofAdsorbtion by Activated Carbon from Dilute AqueousSolution, Physical Adsorption Processes andPrinciples, L.

Nandi and P.L. Walker, Jr., Fuel 54 169 1975 . Comparison of these prior art molecular sieve characteristics with those of the present invention shows a major difference. The prior art process of heating coconut char at 17420F 9500C for 2 hours under nitrogen generated a carbon sieve with a high oxygen diffusivity value, high oxygen nitrogen selectivity but very low oxygen capacity. The present process maximizes both capacity and selectivity without restricting diffusivity to unreasonably low levels. Claims to the invention follow.
