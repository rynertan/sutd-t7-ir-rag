## Description
A MAGNETIC RETAINER ASSEMBLY The present invention relates generally to magnetic retainers and, in particular, to a new and improved magnetic retainer assembly adapted for selective attachment to and detachment from an object of magnetic material hereinafter magnetic or magnetizable object , such as a workpiece or a portion of a machine tool.Magnetic retainers according to the invention may be used, for example, as a magnetic base adapted to be magnetically secured to an object for supporting a measuring instrument such as a dial gauge with a post or arm member provided thereon, or as a magnetic chuck or grip for holding against gravitational drop an unsupported portion of a workpiece being progressively severed by cutting. The invention relates further to a deformable magnetic retainer assembly which can withstand a high degree of deformation and can readily be applied to a magnetizable object or objects to hold it or retain them together. In a conventional magnetic retainer, e.g. a magnetic base, adapted to be magnetically secured on a magnetizable object, a limited size of its base member has considerably restricted the magnetic attraction attainable between a permanent magnet accommodated therein and the object. The use of a larger base member in an attempt to increase the magnetic attraction renders the whole assembly undesirably heavy and bulky, making it inadequate or inconvenient for easy handling by the operator. In addition, the conventional magnetic base, which is block formed, is relatively unstable when placed on an object for supporting a post or arm member to which a relatively large or heavy measuring instrument is mounted.Furthermore, a considerable reduction in the attractive capability of the permanent magnet has been encountered with the prior art magnetic retainer assembly while in use in which attachment and detachment are repeated. It should also be noted that needs exist for deformable magnetic retainers which can readily be applied to, for example, a corrugated surface of a magnetizable object to magnetically retain it or an angular junction of two or more magnetizable parts to magnetically hold them together, or to nip a magnetizable article on its two opposed surfaces to magnetically grip it. Conventional deformable magnetic retainers employ a deformable material in which particles of a permanent magnet material are uniformly distributed. These retainers have, however, been of limited utility because of their inability to undergo a high degree of deformation. When subjected to such deformation, they tend to create cracks therin. Furthermore, the known deformable magnetic retainers are either relatively short in service life or poor in magnetic attraction capability.EMI3.1 It is, accordingly, a principal object of the present invention to provide a new, improved and useful magnetic retainer assembly which is much more efficient and superior in operating performance than existing magnetic retainer assemblies. Another important object of the present invention is to provide a magnetic retainer assembly which is less susceptible to demagnetization or a reduction in magnetic attraction capability, or greater in service life than prior magnetic retainer assemblies. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a magnetic retainer assembly which is deformable, and which is much greater in deformability without damaging, greater in service life and yet much grater in magnetic attraction capability than conventional magnetic retainer assemblies of deformable type.EMI3.2 According to the present invention there is provided a new, improved and useful magnetic retainer assembly adapted for selective attachment to and detachment from, a magnetic object, which assembly comprises a plurality of permanent magnet members of a uniform shape and size arranged regularly in a predetermined set of positions in the assembly for individually producing magnetic fields of a uniform field strength support means in the assembly for holding the permanent magnet members securely therein and positioning said members spaced apart from one another in an essentially magnetically insulating relationship and magnetic path forming means in the sup port member for providing a magnetic path for each of the permanent magnet members to be magnetically conducted with the magnetizable object, thereby magnetically securing the assembly to the object. Specifically, each of the permanent magnet members may be columnar in shape, e.g. rectangular, cylindrical or disk shaped with two opposed parallel end surfaces having an equal area and forming N and S pole surfaces. Each permanent magnet member should preferably be constituted by a unitary body of a rare earth cobalt permanent magnet material although any other permanent magnet material may also be used. The support means may be constituted by a base member in the form of a circular disk, or square or rectangualr plate composed of a non magnetic or para magnetic material in which permanent magnet members are embeded at positions equi distantly spaced apart about a center thereof. Alternatively, the base member may be composed of a semi magnetic material constituted by a mixture of magnetic particles and a non magnetic material such as a synthetic resin.

assembly of the invention and FIG. 50 is a longitudinal cross sectional view illustrating a further embodiment of the invention. Referring first to FIGS. 1 3, a magnetic retainer assembly 1 according to the invention makes use of a plurality of permanent magnet bodies 2 which may each be columnar in shape and fittedly accommodated in a nonmagnetic cylinder 3 coaxial therewith. The non magnetic cylinders 3, which may be of plastics, are, in turn, fittedly accommodated in recesses 4 formed in a rectangular ferromagnetic plate 5 which may be of iron and is slidably received in a compartment 6 formed in a rectangular ferromagnetic block 7 which may also be of iron. The ferromagnetic plate 5 is movable slidably in the compartment 6 from right to left and vice versa, as viewed in the drawing, by means of a handle 8. One pole,N or S pole, or each permanent magnet 2 is arranged flush with the upper wall 9 of the ferromagnetic plate 5 and the upper face 10 of each non magnetic cylinder 3.The ferromagnetic block 7 is formed with openings 11 each of which extends from its upper surface into the compartment 6, is tapered so as to be upwardly divergent and may be rectangular in cross section. Each tapered opening 11 accepts a ferromagnetic core member 12 e.g. of iron coaxially therewith, which is in the form of a truncated cone with the peripheral surface spaced from the tapered opening 1.1 by a gap which is filled with a non magnetic or semi magnetic material 13. The filling 13, when nonmagnetic, may be composed of a synthetic resin or adhesive material and when semi magnetic may be composed of such a non magnetic material mixed with particles of a magnetic material such as iron, a ferrite or an amorphous magnetic metal or alloy. The filling 13 is bonded to either the ferromagnetic block 7 of the ferromagnetic core member 12 or both.The ferromagnetic block 7 is shown located below a magnetizable object 14 such as a plate workpiece in contact with the lower surface 15 thereof. It will be seen that when the ferromagnetic plate 5 within the compartment 6 is moved to the position shown in FIG. 2, the core members 12, having their upper surfaces in contact with the magnetizable object 14, have their lower surfaces in contact with one pole of each permanent magnet 2 whose other pole is connected with the object 14 via the ferromagnetic plate 5 and the ferromagnetic block 7. A closed magnetic circuit is thus established individually for each permanent magnet 2 which individually produces a magnetic field, whereby the assembly 1 is magnetically secured to the magnetized object 14. In this state, each of the plural permanent magnets 2 is located coaxially with the corresponding tapered opening 11 and hence with the corresponding core or pole member 12. The plural permanent magnets 2 are of a uniform shape and size and are composed of a same material to individually produce magnetic fields of a uniform intensity. Accordingly, uniform forces of magnetic attraction are developed at uniformly distributed locations in the interface 15 between the ferromagnetic block 7 and the magnetic object 14. The result is a highly stabilized and firm retention of the assembly 1 to the object 14 or vice versa. When the ferromagnetic plate 5 is moved to the position shown in FIG. 3, the upper pole of each permanent magnet 2 comes below the non magnetic or semi magnetic filling 13.The magnetic circuit which has been established is thus broken or substantially broken individually for each permanent magnet 12, permitting the assembly 1 to be readily detached from the magnetic object 14. In case the assembly 1 is fixed, the object 14 can be detached from or becomes readily displaceable on the upper surface 15 of the ferromagnetic block 7. It will be understood that each pole area of each permanent magnet 2 should be substantially equal to or not greater than the lower end area of each core member 12 and should not be greater than the width of the filling or gap 13.The use of a semimagnetic material, rather than a non magnetic material, to fill the gap 13 between the ferromagnetic core member 12 and block 7 is advantageous in preventing each permanent 2 from demagnetizing or progressively losing its magnetic attractive power through its repeated attachment to and detachment from the magnetizable object 14. The upwardly divergent tapered formations of both the core member 12 and the opening 11 are found to assure an increased setting accuracy of the member 12 and the filling 13 in the opening 11. FIG. 4 shows a modified arrangement in which the tapered ferromagnetic core or pole member 12 is supported in the tapered opening 11 formed in the ferromagnetic block 7. In this arrangement, a tapered ring 16 composed of a nonmagnetic metal such as copper, brass or stainless steel is seated on the tapered walls of the opening 11 to support the tapered core or pole member 12. A non magnetic or semi magnet ic material as mentioned above can then be injected from above and below to fill the remaining spaces 13 between the ferromagnetic block 7 and core or pole member 12. An increased positioning accuracy of the member 12 within the opening 11 is here again attained. In a magnetic retainer assembly 17 shown in FIG.5, a continuous groove 18 is formed in a portion of the rectangular ferromagnetic block 7 above the compartment 6 FIGS.2 and 3 in which the rectangular ferromagnetic plate 5 is slidably received as previously described. The groove 18 is filled with a non magnetic or semi magnetic material 19 of the type previously described. In the rectangular plate 5 twelve permanent magnets 2 are shown as embedded in a manner as described previously. In this embodiment, a portion of the ferromagnetic block 7 inside the groove 18 is designed to constitute a unitary pole member 12 for the permanent magnets 2 so that when the plate 5 lies in the position shown, each permanent magnet 2 is allowed to establish a closed mag netic circuit with the pole member 12, a magnetizable object 14 not shown , a portion of the block 7 outside the groove 18 and the plate 5, thereby magnetically attaching the assembly 17 firmly to the object 14.When the plate 5 is moved right or left by maneuvering the handle 8 to such a position that the permanent magnets 2 are located immediately below the groove 18 and hence below the filling 19, the magnetic circuits are broken to release the object 14 from the assembly 17. A magnetic retainer assembly 20 of the invention shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 comprises an upper member 21 mounted on a lower member 22 in intimate contact therewith at an interface 14. Both members 21 and 22 may be disk plates as apparent from FIG. 6 and are composed of a ferromagnetic material.The disk plate constituting the upper member 21 is formed with a starfish like groove 23 as shown and is thereby divided into an inner portion 24 and an outer portion 25. The groove 23 is filled with a non magnetic material or semi magnetic material 26 as specified previously which here serves to firmly bridge the inner and outer portions 24 and 25 of the upper member 21. The inner and outer portions 24 and 25 are accordingly formed with outer and inner contours, respectively, each of which is of starfish shape. The inner portion 24 is here formed with seven projections 24a, at end zones of which are seen seven permanent magnets 2, respectively. In this state, each permanent magnet 2 is located directly below the corresponding end portion 24a as shown in FIG. 7.The p ermanent magnet 2 being again columnar in shape and having opposite poles N and S at its upper and lower end faces, respectively, is embedded in a non magnetic or semi magnetic re such disk 3 at a cent t thereof that the upper and lower end faces of the permanent magnet 2 are flush with the upper and lower surfaces of the disk 3, respectively. The disk 3 is, in turn, fittedly seated in a cylindrical cavity 4 formed in the disk plate constituting the lower member 22 so that the upper surface of the disk 3 is flush with the upper surface of the lower member 22. It will be seen that in this state, a magnetic path for the permanent magnet, 2 is established and maintained through the projection 24a, a magnetizable object not 21 shown to be retained on the surface 15, the upper plate P and the lower plate 22.The lower disk 22 is here arranged to be rotatable relative to the upper disk 21 about their common axis. When the lower disk 22 is rotated clockwise or counterclockwise to a position in which each permanent magnet 2 is located directly below the filling 26, the object is magnetically released from the assembly 20 or vice versa. FIG. 8 shows a modification of the structure ofFIG. 7 in which the outer and inner portions 24 and 25 of the upper member 21 are so cut as to form a starfish like groove 26 such that its outer and inner flanks are tapered so as to be divergent upwardly and downwardly, respectively, to provide a modified sectional structure of the assembly 20 similar to that of the assembly l shown in FIG. 3 and to achieve the essentially same functions previously described in connection therewith. The inner and outer portions 24 and 25 of the upper member 21 divided by the starfish like groove 26 can readily be prepared from a single disk plate by, for example, a traveling wire electroerosion machine utilizing a continuous electrode wire continuously advanced axially through the disk plate. Electroerosion machining current is applied between the traveling wire and the disk plate while the traveling axis of the electrode wire and the disk plate is relatively displaced orthogonally to the traveling axis along a predetermined cutting path to achieve first the desired outer starfishlike contour of the inner portion 24 or the desired inner starfish like contour of the outer portion 25. After removing one of these severed portions, the other left is further subjected to traveling wire electroerosion cutting operation to yield the desired inner starfish like contour of the outer portion 24 or the desired outer starfish like contour of the inner portion 24. The two machined portions are then positioned and the filing 26 is applied in the interstice or groove 26 to firmly bridge the two portions 24 and 25 together to yield a finish upper member 21 as shown in FIG. 6. The desired tapered flanks as shown in FIG. 8 are readily obtained by inclining the traveling electrode wire with respect to the disk plate at an angle corresponding to the desired angle of taper. A magnetic retainer assembly 30 shown in FIG. 9 makes use of a rectangular plate 31 composed of a ferromagnetic material and having three inner portions 32, 33 and 34 separated by three shaped grooves 35, 36 and 37, respectively, from the outer portion of the plate 31. Each of the grooves 35, 36 and 37 is filled with a non magnetic or semi magnetic material as previously described. Permanent magnets not shown are embedded in a lower plate not shown at respective positions corresponding to zones of projection 32a of the inner portion 32, zones of projection 33a of the inner portion 33 and zones of projections 34a of the inner portion 34 as previously described. FIG. 10 shows a magnetic retainer assembly 50 according to the invention used as a base of a magnet stand 40 for supporting a measuring instrument such as a dial gauge 41 on a magnetizable object 14 such as a ferrous workpiece. The gauge 41 is shown supported by an arm 42 secured to a block 43 which is slidably movable on a post 44 and can be secured thereto at a desired vertical position by a fixing means not shown . The magnet base 50 comprises a base disk plate 51 adapted to be placed on the magnetizable object 14 in intimate contact therewith and an upper disk plate 52 coaxially placed on the base disk plate 51 in intimate contact therewith. As shown in FIG. 10, the post 44 extends into the upper disk 52 which has three circular openings 52a, 52b and 52c which, as shown in FIG. 11, are positioned symmetrically about the post 44. The post 44 is secured to the base disk 51 whereas the upper disk 52 is arranged to be turnable about the post 44 relative to the fixed base disk 51. The upper disk 52 is composed of a ferromagnetic material whereas the base disk 51 is composed of a non magnetic material. The post 44 is likewise composed of a non magnetic material. Referring to FIG. ll a , three small permanent magnets 2a, 2b and 2c composed of a rare eÅarth cobalt material are seen located coaxially with and exposed through the openings 52a, 52b and 52c, respectively. Referring also to FIG. 12 a , each of the permanent magnets 2a 2c is cylinder columnar in shape having two opposed poles N and S at its parallel upper and lower faces and is fittedly retained with a cylinder 3a, 3b, 3c of a non magnetic or semi magnetic material as previously specified. The cylinder 3a, 3b, 3c is, in turn, fittedly retained in a cylinder 53a, 53b, 53c of a ferromagnetic material which is in turn embedded in the base disk 51 of non magnetic material. When the upper plate 52 is in the position shown in FIGS. ll a and 12 a , it will be seen that each of the openings 52a, 52b and 52c provides an air gap of large reluctance such that the assembly 50 can readily be detached from the retaining plate object 14. When the upper plate 52 is turned to the position shown in FIGS. ll b and 12 b , the openings 52a, 52b and 52c are removed from the upper faces of the permanent magnets 2a 2c so that each of the magnets 2 can establish a magnetic path of high flux conductance through the upper disk 52, the ferromagnetic cylinder 53 and the magnetic object 14, thereby firmly locking the assembly 50 onto the magnetized object 14. In a modified magnetic base 50 shown in FIGS. 13 a and 13 b , not only an upper disk 52 formed with openings 52a, 52b and 52c but a base disk 51 is composed of a ferromagnetic material and each of permanent magnets 2a, 2b and 2c is retained in a non magnetic or semi magnetic material filled in an opening 54a, 54b, 54c which is formed in the ferromagnetic base disk 51 and is preferably tapered as shown for the reason previously noted. The filling to accommodate the permanent magnet in each tapered opening is preferably composed of a semi magnetic material. The semi magnetic material for use in the practice of the invention preferably comprises an adhesive of, say, epoxy family, phenol family, acryl family, styrene family or cyane family in which particles composed of a ferromagnetic material such as iron, permalloy, sendust or amorphous magnetic metal are uniformly distributed. The magnetic particles should tnicrometres be of a particle size ranging between 0.1 and 50EMI19.1 Tapes of magnetic material, say, of a thickness of 5 microns and a length of l0mm may also be used. Furthermore, particles of a permanent magnetic material such as a ferrite, an ironchromium cobalt alloy or a rare earth cobalt material are useful. In a further modification 50 of FIGS. 14 a and 14 b , each opening 55a, 55b, 55c formed in a ferromagnetic base disk 51 to be filled with the semi magnetic material to accommodate the permanent magnet 2a, 2b, 2c is formed with a saw toothed wall as shown. Such rugged formations in the cylindrical wall of each opening is advantageous in firmly retaining the semi magnetic material or adhesive injected and set therein to retain the permanent magnet 2a, 2b, 2c. In FIG. 15 there is shown another magnetic retainer assembly 60 used as the base of a magnetic stand of the type described in connection with FIG. 10. The assembly 60 comprises a disk plate 61 of a non magnetic material shown lying on a magnetizable object such as a workpiece 14 and an upper plate 62 having three projections 63 and accepting a lower end portion 46 of the post 44 through a center thereof, which portion extends into and is secured to the disk plate 61.The upper plate 62 is arranged in contact and coaxially with the disk plate 61 and is turnable on the post 46. Referring to FIGS. 16 and 17, the disk plate 61 has three permanent magnets 2 of a uniform size embedded therein at positions symmetrical about the post 46. Each permanent magnet 2 is in the form of a relatively thin disk. Likewise, the upper plate 62 has three permanent magnets 64 of a uniform size the embedded in the regions ofZthree projections 63 thereof, re spectively, thus symmetrically about the post 64 and corresponding to the positions of the permanent magnets 2. Each permanent magnet 64 is in the form of a relatively thick disk having a diameter equal to that of each permanent magnet 2.Each permanent magnet 2 has its upper and lower pole faces flush with the upper and lower surfaces of the base disk plate 61, respectively, whereas each permanent magnet 64 has its lower pole face flush with the lower surface of the upper plate 62 and its upper pole face within the plate 62. Both permanent magnets 2 and 64 are composed of a same rare earth cabalt magnetic material. It is desirable that the permanent magnets 24 be at least two times thicker than the permanent magnets 2. The three projections 63 forming a Y are shape t provided for the upper plate 62 to ease the turning thereof with the operator s hand. The lower portion 46 of the post 44 is composed of a ferromagnetic material. It will be seen that when the rotary upper plate 62 is in such a position as to place each permanent magnet 64 therein immediately above the corresponding permanent magnet 2 in the base plate 61 as shown in FIG. 18, the direction of internal magnetic field of the permanent magnet 2 coincides FIG. 18 with that of the permanent magnet 64 as shown by the arrow Rl whereby a composite permanent magnet of much intensified field strength is provided in contact with the magnetic object 14.At the same time, a closed magnetic circuit through the upper plate 62, the ferromagnetic portion of post 46 and the magnetic object 14 is established to allow the magnetic flux G from the composite magnet 2 plus 64 to pass therethrough, thereby firmly securing the assembly 60 to the magnetic object 14. When, however, the rotary upper plate 62 is turned to a position as shown in FIG. 17, the closed magnetic circuit is broken so that as is apparent also from FIG. 19, the permanent magnets 64 of a greater field strength become ineffective, allowing only permanent magnets 2 to be attracted with a limited force of magnetic attraction to the magnetic object 14 and thus permitting the assembly 60 to be readily detached from the object 14. FIGS. 20 26 shown various modifications of the magnetic base 60 for use with a magnetic stand or the like.Thus, the magnetic base 60 of FIG. 20 makes use of the upper plate 62 in the form of a circular disk with its diameter slightly greater than that of the base plate disk 61 to facilitate detachment of the assembly 60. In the arrangement of FIG.21, the pole face of each base permanent magnet 2 and each upper permanent magnet 64 is enlarged in area to allow a greater force of magnetic attraction to be exerted thereby to the magnetic object 14. The magnetic base 60 of FIG. 22 employs an upper plate 62 fitted with a ring 65 having a knurled periphery 65a to ease the gripping by the operator. The ring 65 may be of a non magnetic material such as a plastic which is readily machinable. FIG. 26 shows that the upper face of each permanent magnet 64 may be exposed from the upper plate or disk 62. In the arrangement ofFIG. 23, the lower ferromagnetic portion 46 of the post 44 is threaded into the base disk 61 and secured thereto. To allow the upper plate or disk 62 to turn about the post 46, a ferromagnetic ring 66 is provided to receive the threaded lower portion 46 of the post 44 and secured thereto on the base disk 61.The upper plate or disk 62 is then arranged to be turnable on the ferromagnetic ring 66. In the arrangement of FIGS. 24 and 25, the upper plate 62 is rectangular in shape. A magnetic retainer assembly according to the invention is advantageously used, among other uses, to bridge two severed portions of a magnetizable object. InFIG. 27, there is shown a workpiece W being cut with an electrode wire E in a traveling wire electroerosion machine and thereby progressively severed into two portions 14 and 14 across the progressively developing path of cut or cutting groove C. It is shown that the portion 14 remains supported on a support member S while the portion 14 becomes unsupported and tends to drop, due to gravity, from the supported portion 14. The dropping portion, upon collision with the electrode wire X, causes a damaging short circuiting and may even break it.Such inconvenience is avoided by placing, as shown in FIG. 28, on the workpiece W, so as to bridge the two severed portions 14 and 14 , a magnetic retainer assembly 70 of the invention especially adapted to this application. The magnetic retainer assembly 70 according to the invention shown in FIG. 29, includes a plurality of permanent magnets 2 of a uniform size and shape composed, preferably, of a rare earth cobalt magnetic material. The permanent magnets 2 are cylindrical columnar in shape and arranged uniformly over the floor 71a of a housing 71 composed of a non magnetic material such as stainless steel or brass. Each permanent magnet 2 is here again retained in a cylindrical member 72 of a non magnetic material, such a plastics, which is in turn retained in a cup shaped ferromagnetic member 73.The housing 71 is seated on the workpiece W in such a manner that its floor 71a bridges the supported portion 14 and the unsupported portion 14 across the cut groove C. The space within the housing 71 may be filled with a non magnetic material to have the ferromagnetic members 73 embedded therein. The floor portion 71a of the housing 71 should be sufficiently thin the minimize the magnetic reluctance for the magnetic flux from each permanent magnet 2 to pass into the magnetic workpiece 14, 14 and through the ferromagnetic member 73 with a sufficient flux density to allow the assembly 70 to be firmly attracted to the workpiece. The housing 71 is provided with a handle 74 to be gripped by the operator for convenience.FIG. 30 B shows a crosssection of each permanent magnet 2 and its surrounding non magnetic cylinder 72 and cup shaped ferromagnetic member 73 secured on the floor portion 71a of the housing 70. It will be appreciated that the non magnetic member 72 may be dispensed with and the ferromagnetic fieldconcentrator member 73 may be in the form of a U shaped arm as is apparent from FIG. 30 A . The housing 71 composed of non magnetic material is advantageously provided to prevent ferromagnetic machining chips from magnetically sticking on the assembly 70. In this manner, the possible reduction of the retention ability of the assembly 70 onto the workpiece 14, i4 is effectively prevented. A magnetic retainer assembly 80 shown in FIG. 31 secured onto or retaining a magnetic object 14 comprises five parallel layers 81 85 of which the outermost and centre layers 81, 82 and 83 are uniformly composed of a ferromagnetic substance such as an iron material. Each of the other two layers 84 and 85 incorporates a pair of permanent magnets 2 which may have again be disk shaped with their respective poles as shown. Each permanent magnet 2 is accommodated in a receptacle of a semimagnetic material 86 which is in turn embedded in a nonmagnetic substance constituting the layer 84, 85. The semi magnetic material 86 is here again composed of an adhesive material having fine particles of a magnetic material uniformly distributed therein as previously described.The assembly 80 is completed with a thin layer 87 of a high hardness material such as titanium, titaniumnitride or titanium coated thereon. It is desirable that this layer be applied at least on the retention surface 88 of the assembly 80 to protect it against wear and abrasion. The layer 87 may be deposited on the surface by using electroplating, vapor deposition, sputtering or ion plating. A switchable magnetic assembly 90 shown inFIGS. 32 and 33 comprises a magnetic block 90a and a pathforming block 90b which are movable relative to each other while holding a sliding contact therebetween. The movement is applied by a handle 91. The magnetic block 90a comprises four layers 92 of a ferromagnetic substance and three layers 93 of a non magnetic substance in which permanent magnets 2 are embedded as shown. The pathforming block 90a likewise comprises four layers 94 of the ferromagnetic substance and three layers 95 of the nonmagnetic substance as shown. When the two blocks 90a and 90b are positioned as shown in FIG. 32, each permanent magnet 2 in the magnetic block 90a maintains a closed magnetic circuit with a magnetic object not shown placed over the upper surface of the path forming block 90b, thereby holding the object to be attracted on that surface and hence on the assembly 90. When the upper block 90b is displaced by the handle 91 so as to bring the nonmagnetic layers 95 in the path forming block 90a above the respective ferromagnetic layers 92 in the magnetic block 90a , the magnetic paths are broken to magnetically deactuate the assembly.A solid lubricant is desirably included at a proportion by volume from 5 to 15 in the non magnetic layers 93 and 95 at least along their mutual contact surfaces and may include molybdenum sulfide MoS2 , tungsten sulfide WS2 , titanium nitride TiN , iron oxide Fe203 , graphite, graphite fluoride and boron nitride BN . The non magnetic substance constituting the layers 93 and 95 may be a synthetic resin, ceramic or nonmagnetic metal e.g. brass, copper . In addition, particles of aluminium oxide, boron nitride, silicon carbide, titanium carbide and or tungsten carbide may be incorporated. In a modified arrangement of FIGS. 34 and 35, a multiplicity of bearing balls 96 are used between the opposed surfaces of the magneitc block 90a and the pathforming block 90b to improve the smoothness of the sliding motion between the two blocks. The balls 96 are retained in grooves 97 which are formed equi distantly on the upper surface of the magnetic block 90a as shown in FIG. 35.Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 36, reception grooves 98 may be formed on the lower surface of the upper pathforming block 90b to retain balls 96 rotatably therein.It will be understood that the illustrated ball arrangement may be replaced by an arrangement utilizing a. multiplicity of bearing rollers or rotatable bars. The principles of the present invention can advantageously be applied in designing a deformable magnetic retainer assembly as well. It should be noted that conventional magnetic retainers have commonly employed a matrix of a deformable material such as rubber in which particles of a permanent magnetic material are uniformly distributed. With them, there has always been the dilemma that a satisfactory magnetic retention is obtainable only at the sacrifice of deformability and a significant deformability is obtainable at the loss of magnetic retention. Furthermore, even if both reasonable magnetic retentivity and deformability, the conventional retainer of this class tends to form cracks therein through repeated bending or elongation and is thus relatively short lived.The invention thus provides a deformable magnetic retainer assembly which can withstand a high degree of deformation without forming cracks therein and is characterized by a prolonged life of service. In FIG. 37, a pair of magnetizable blocks A andB are shown held together with a novel deformable magnetic retainer assembly 100 according to the invention and thereby held on a plate D. Side portions C of each block A, B may be non magnetic. It is seen that the assembly 100 is deflected to form an angle of 900 or more. Such a high degree of deflec tion has been practically unrealistic with the conventional deformable magnetic retainer. An embodiment of the assembly 100 shown in FIG.38 comprises an elongate matrix of deformable material 101 uniformly composed of, say, rubber and a pair of permanent magnets 2 embedded at two end regions of the elongate matrix 101. Each permanent magnet 2 is shown having its axis of magnetization R perpendicular to the wider surfaces of the elongate matrix 101. Each permanent magnet 2 should preferably be shaped to be greater in diameter at its center zone between the N and S poles not to easily dislodge from the matrix 101.In this embodiment, the two magnets 2 are widely spaced apart and bridged only by the uniform deformable material of the matrix 101 so that the cracking problem may entirely be eliminated. The basic structure of the deformable magnetic retainer assembly 100 of FIG. 39 is improved by flanking or sandwiching each permanent magnet 2 embedded in the matrix 101 with two ferromagnetic or semi magnetic plates 102 in contact with its opposed pole faces and exposed flush with the surfaces of the matrix 101. Each semi magnetic plate 102 may be composed of a deformable material in which fine particles of a ferromagnetic material are uniformly distributed. The plates 102 advantageously serve to protect each permanent against wear and, when composed of semi magnetic material, further serve to prevent demagnetization of each permanent magnet 2 as previously described.Similar improvements are achieved by embedding each permanent magnet 2 in a body of semi magnetic materail 103 as shown in FIG. 40 or by providing a single plate 102 in contact with one pole face upper of each permanent magnet 2. Permanent magnets 2 and their individually associated semi magnetic bodies 103 may be arranged in the matrix 101 of uniform deformable material in a plurality of longitudinal or lateral rows as shown in FIGS. 42 a and 42 b or of vertical rows as shown in FIG. 43. and 45 FIGI. 44 show a deformable magnetic retainer assembly 200 as applied to a corrugated ferromagnetic body A having a plurality of parallel elongate recesses C in each of which an elongate opening B is provided. The assembly 200 is deformed to closely conform to the recesses C and the adjacent projections and is magnetically secured thereto while sealing up the openings B. A deformable magnetic retainer assembly is quite convenient because it eliminates the need for bolting and keeps a securable object free from contamination. The deformable magnetic retainer assembly 200 according to the invention may take the form diagrammatically shown in FIGS.46 and 47. The assembly 200 shown comprises a matrix 201 composed uniformly of a deformable material of a high degree of deformability in which a multiplicity of sub matrices 203 composed of a deformable material of a relatively low deform ability are regularly distributed. Each sub matrix 203 has a plurality of permanent magnets 2 regularly arranged therein.The double matrix structure assures both firm retention of permanent magnets 2 therein and due deformability of the assembly. Each permanent magnet 2 is preferably enclosed with a deformable semi magnetic material 204 or sandwitched with a pair plates of deformable semi magnetic material as shown in FIGS. 48 and 49. The deformable semi magnetic material consists of a deformable material in which fine magnetic particles are uniformly distributed. A deformable magnetic retainer assembly 110 shown in FIG. 50 comprises five layers of which the outermost and center layers 111, 112 and 113 are composed of an elastomeric material with which particles, tapes, wool or fragments of a magnetic material are mixed. Intermediate layers 114 and 115 are composed of an elastomeric and non magnetic material in which permanent magnets 2 are regularly arranged as shown.The elastomeric materials for use include natural rubber,SBR butadiene styrene rubber , neoprene rubber, nitrile rubber, polybutadiene rubber, polyisoprene rubber, silicon rubber, chlorosulfuric polyethylene rubber and elastomers of epoxy family and chloroprene family. The magnetic materials for use include iron cobalt, iron nickel, iron cobalt nickel,Fe203, nickel iron molybdenum e.g. 79 Ni 17 Fe and 4 Mo by weight , silicon aluminum iron e.g. 9.5 Si, 5.5 Al and 85 Fe and nickel aluminum silicon iron e.g. 3.2 Ni, 1 Al, 6 Si and 86.2 Fe alloys. The parmanent magnetic materials for use include iron chromium cobalt alloys, rare earth cobalt alloys e.g. SmCo5 and Sm2Co17 . The magnetic material for mixture with an elastomeric material may also be amorphous metallic tapes having a thickness of 0.1 to 1 micron. Examples of the amorphous magnetic metals include 4.7 Fe 70.3 Co 15 Si, 3 Fe 72 Co 6 B 16 P, 4.2 Fe 61.6 Co 4.2 Ni, and 23 Nb 10 Si 15 B. The magnetic particles may be of a particle size ranging between 0.5 and 30 microns. The magnetic wool of a thickness ranging between micrometres 0.5 and 10EMI32.1 may be cut into fragments of a length rangmicrometres ing between 0.5 and 20EMI32.2 The magnetic material may be included into the elastomeric mate rail at a proportion of at least 2 or 3 by volume, usually between 5 and 30 by volume and up to 40 by volume.
