# Electrographic coordinate input system and method.

## Abstract
An electrographic system and method having a control which carries out correction for graphic surface non linearities. The control employs a procedure wherein a correction look up table is developed as part of the manufac ture of the device wherein output readings are taken along a physical domain rectangular grid array of predetermined dimension and these output readings are adjusted in their signal domain to establish a regularly incremented sequence of address values within that signal domain. Physical domain coordinate values then are derived and placed in the table for each address value. The control then accesses this memory for each of a given locator or tracer position on the graphic surface and carries out an interpolative weighting to derive acceptably accurate coordinate pair signals which are out putted to a host computer or the like.
