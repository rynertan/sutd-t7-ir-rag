# External isolation module.

## Abstract
The invention concerns an external issolation module 42 adapted to operatively interconnect at least one pair of a plurality of adjacent vacuum chambers 28, 30 through which a substrate 11 travels and into which reaction materials are introduced. The external isolation module 42 provides a passageway 44 for the substrate 11 between adjacent chambers while substantially preventing the diffusion of reaction materials from one of the chambers into the adjacent chamber. An accessible, environmentally sealed, reaction material isolating passageway is thereby formed.
