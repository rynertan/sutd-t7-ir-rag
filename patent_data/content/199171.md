# A METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING CASEIN BASED, COAT FORMING POLYMERS OF INCREASED ELASTICITY

## Abstract
A method of obtaining casein based, coat forming po lymers of increased elasticity involves reacting casein with compounds having an epoxy grouping, and particularly with glycydol at a rate of 0.1 300 by weight in relation to casein over a temperature range of 20 120 C. In addition to glycydol use is made in the reaction of other epoxy compounds, and particularly epichlorhydrin or glycydol ethers. The reaction can also be carried out using other epoxy compound instead of glycydol. In case the reaction is carried out in an aqueous solution, it is preferred to add dicyandiamide or urea at a rate of 30 in relation to casein.
