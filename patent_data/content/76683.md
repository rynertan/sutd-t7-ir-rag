# Apparatus and method for controlling the pH of a continuous process stream.

## Abstract
The invention provides a pH control system and method for maintaining the proper pH in a continuous process stream 20, 27 . A continuous sample stream 21 has its pH and composition time averaged in a backmixing vessel 22 to reduce the dynamic gain of the pH control system, and the pH of the time averaged sample is determined by a pH analyzer 23 . A pH controller 24 is responsive to the pH as determined by the analyzer 23 to control the rate of addition of reagent or buffer to the process stream by regulating the setting of valve 25 on a continuous basis.
