# Solid state color television camera device.

## Abstract
According to the invention, a photosensor array having a plurality of photosensors 12 are formed in horizontal and vertical rows on a semiconductor substrate 11 . Vertical charge transfer electrodes 17 1, 17 2, ... are provided along the vertical rows of photosensors for transferring the charges generated in the photosensors along the vertical direction. Charge mixng means 13, 19, 1, 4 are pro vided, within the substrate, for mixing the charges gener ated by the photosensors in successive two horizontal rows of photosensors.
