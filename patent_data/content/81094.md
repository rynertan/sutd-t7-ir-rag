TITLE OF THE INVENTION SUBSTITUTED U AMINO CARBOxYMETHYLDIPEPTIDE ANTIHYPERTENSIVE AGENTSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention is concerned with substituted amino carboxymethyldipeptide compounds which are effective inhibitors of angiotensin I converting enzyme. These novel compounds are, consequently, combined with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers to form pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention and are used in a method of treating hypertension. Angiotensin II, a powerful vasoconstrictor hormonal peptide, is formed from the inactive angiotensin I by the action of angiotensinconverting enzyme. Recently, potent inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme have been reported which are capable of lowering the blood pressure in hypertensive patients. The compounds of the present invention are also potent inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme.2. Brief Description of the Prior Art U.S. Patents 4,113,715 4,129.571 and 4,154,960 disclose substituted acyl derivatives of amino acids which are useful as angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors. More specifically, these compounds are mercapto substituted acyl amino acids an derivatives thereof including the clinically effective antihypertensive compound, captopril, i.e.,D 3 mercapto 2 methylpropanoyl L proline. The foregoing prior art compounds are not dipeptide derivatives as are the compounds of the present invention. Furthermore, these prior art compounds contain an essential sulfhydryl substituent or derivative thereof whereas those of the present invention do not. In addition, the dipeptide compounds of the present invention are unusual dipeptides whose N terminus,bears a carboxymethyl group which is preferably further substituted on the methyl group. In addition, the carboxyl group s may also be converted to ester, amide and salt derivatives In effect, the compounds of the present invention are hybrids formed by fusing a amino acids onto dipeptides by means of a nitrogen shared by these two part structures.This structural arrangement is rare in the field of synthetic and natural peptides and is not suggested or disclosed by the mercaptoacyl type functions of the two prior art patents identified above. U.S. Patent 4,us2,511 discloses N carboxvalkanoyl amino acids which are useful as angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors. Since the compounds of the. present invention are dipeptide derivatives, in a formal sense they may be considered to be related to some of the compounds disclosed inU.S. Patent 4,052,511. However, when a particular one of the methylene groups is replaced by an am no function as in the present invention, compounds of surprisingly high potency are obtained.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND PREFERREDEMBODIMENTS In its broadest aspect, the present invention relates to substituted Qr amino carhoxymethylaipeptide compounds of. the formulae EMI3.1 wherein R. is hydrogen loweralkyl aralkyl aryl Rlis hydrogen C1 12 alkyl C39 cycloalkyl C1 12 alkenyl substituted loweralkyl where the substituents are halo, hydroxy loweralkoxy, aryloxy, amino, mono or diloweralkylamino, acylamino, arylamino, guanidino, mercapto, loweralkylthio, arylthio, carboxy, carboxamido, or loweralkoxycarbonyl aryl substituted aryl where the substituents are loweralkyl, loweralkoxy, or halo arloweralkyl arloweralkenyl heteroarloweralkyl heteroarloweralkenyl substituted arloweralkyl, substituted arloweralkenyl, substituted heteroarloweralkyl, or substituted heteroarloweralkenyl where the aryl and heteroaryl substituents are halor loweralkyl, hydroxy, loweralkoxy, amino, aminoloweralkyl, acylamino, mono or diloweralkylamino, carboxyl, haloloweralkyl, cyano, or sulfonamido, and where the loweralkyl portion of arloweralkyl may be substituted by amino, acylamino, or hydroxyl EMI4.1 whereX and Y taken together are CH2 CH2 EMI5.1 is is hydrogen or loweralkyl R5 is hydrogen loweralkyl aryl or substituted aryl n is 1 to 3 W is absent CH2 orEMI5.2 Z is CH2 m , where m is O to 2, provided that m may not be 0 and W may not be absent at the same time andR6 is hydrogen loweralkyl halo or OR4 R3 is C38 cycloalkyl and benzofused derivatives thereof aryl heteroaryl aralkyl heteroaralkyl R8 is hydrogen loweralkyl R isEMI5.3 where r is 1 2 s is 1 3 B is absent 0 S or NR9 where R9 is hydrogen loweralkyl alkanoyl or aroyl andR7 is loweralkyl loweralkenyl loweralkynyl substituted loweralkyl wherein the substituent is amino, alkyl and dialkylamino, halo, alkoxy or arylthio aralkyl substituted aralkyl wherein the substituent is halo, alkoxy, or hydroxy heteroaralkyl substituted heteroaralkyl wherein the substituent is amino, hydroxy, or loweralkyl and, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

Substituted aryl are substituted by halo, alkoxy, or methyl The arloweralkyl and arloweralkenyl substituents recited above represent phenyl or naphthyl attached through a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon of from one to six carbon atoms, for example, henzyl. Halo means chloro, bromo, iodo, or fluoro. The heteroaryl substituent recited above represents any 5 or 6 membered aromatic ring containing from one to three heteroatoms selected from the qroup consisting of nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, for example, pyridyl, thienyl, furyl, imidazolyl, and thiazolyl as well as any bicyclic group in which any of the above heterocyclic rings is fused to a benzene ring, for example, indolyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, benzimidazolyl, benzothiazolyl, and benzthienyl. The acylamino substituent represents loweralkanoylamino and aroylamino.EMI7.1 the heteroaryl element EMI7.2 provides for expansion of the ring where n is greater than 1 and R4 is hydrogen, or for loweralkyl substitution of the ring where R4 is loweralkyl, or for any combination of both. The Formulae I and Ia compounds can be used in the form of salts derived from inorganic or organic acids. Included among such salts are the following acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, citrate, camphorate, carnphorsulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfoate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2 hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, 2 napbthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3 phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate, and undecanoate.Also, when R H, Formulae I and Ia compounds can beused as salts derived from inorganic or organic bases.

Especially preferred compounds of the present invention are the following N2 1 S carhoxy 3 phenylpropyl N6 methyl L lvsyl L proline N2 1 S carboxy 3 phenylpropyl N6 2 aminoethyl L lysyl L proline N2 1 S carboxy 3 phenylpropyl N6 2 ,2 ,2 trifluoroethyl L lysyl L proline N2 f 1 S carboxy 3 phenylpropyl N6 2 methoxy ethyl L lysyl L proline N2 1 S carboxy 3 phenylpropyl N6 2 dimethyl aminoethyl L lysyl L proline. The compounds of this invention inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme and thus block conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent pressor substance. Thus blood pressure lowering can result from inhibition of its biosynthesis especially in animals and humans whose hypertension is angiotensinII related. Furthermore, converting enzyme degrades the vasodilator peptide, bradykinin. Therefore, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme may lower blood pressure also by potentiation of bradykinin.Although the relative importance of these and other possible mechanisms remains to be established, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme are effective antihypertensive agents in a variety of animal models and are useful clinically, for example, in manyshuman patients with rentvascular, malignant and essential hypertension. See, for example, D. W.Cushman et al., Biochemistry 16, 5484 1977 . The evaluation of converting enzyme inhibitors is guided by in vitro enzme inhibition assays. For example, a useful method is that of Y.Piquilloud, A. Reinharz and M. Roth, Biochem.Biophys. Acta, 206, 136 1970 in which the hydrolysis of carbobenzyloxyphenylalanylhistidinylleucine is measured. In vivo evaluations may be made, for example, in normotensive rats challenged with angiotensin I by the technique of J. R. Weeks and J. A. Jones, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 104, 646 1960 or in a high renin rat model such as that ofS. Koletsky et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 125, 96 1967 Thus, the compounds of the invention are useful in treating hypertension.They are also of value in the management of acute and chronic congestive heart failure, in the treatment of secondary hyperaldosteronism, primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension, renal failure and renal vascular hypertension, and in the management of vascular disorders such as migraine. The application of the compounds of this invention for these and similar disorders will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Thus, in accordance with the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formulae I or Ia. There is also provided, in accordance with the present invention, a method of treating hypertension comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formulae I or Ia. For the purpose of treating hypertension, and those clinical conditions noted above, the compounds of the present invention may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation spray or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles.

A preferred starting material is Nê 1 S carboxy 3 phenylpropyl L lysyl L proline which may be prepared in accordance with Example 57 of European pat. App. No. 0 012 401 referred to above. Methylation using formic acid formaldehyde is conveniently applied toN benzyl intermediates which are then convertible toN methyl products III or IIIa by hydrolysis of the benzyl group using a palladium catalyst in the presence of acetic acid. An additional method for preparing products of this invention involves direct alkylation of compounds II or IIa with compounds having the formula R R CHX, wherein X is bromo, iodo, tosyloxy, mesyloxy, or similar leaving groups, and R and R are as defined above. These alkylations are carried out under basic conditions in solvents such as dimethylformamide or aqueous dimethylformamide.Mixtures of products and starting material are formed which can then be separated by liquid chromatography to yield products of this invention. The following examples are provided to further illustrate the present invention, but not be a limitation thereof.
