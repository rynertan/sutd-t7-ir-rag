# CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A closed circuit television system comprises a television camera 1 , a frequency modulator 2 , a series of lengths of transmission lines 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 forming a transmission path having correcting amplifiers 4, 6, 8, 19 at intervals along its length, a demodulator 12 , and a television monitor 13 . The transmission lines 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 are formed by balanced pair telephone conductors. One application of such a system is in monitoring condi tions on motorways in the U.K. It is advantageous in this envi ronment to be able to use the existing cables which are already installed along the length of the motorway system and by fre quency modulating the video signal on a low frequency carrier so that the bandwidth of the frequency modulated signal lies between 1 and 5 MHz transmission of the signal over greater distances that previously possible can be achieved.
