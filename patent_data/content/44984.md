## Abstract
Process for the optical resolution of mixtures of d and 1 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acids, which comprises preparing a solution of a mixture of d and 1 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acids and an optically active organic base in a predetermined organic solvent, slowly cooling the obtained solution and seeding with crystals of a salt of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid with the optically active organic base containing an amount by weight of the employed organic solvent, varying between about 9.5 and 14 and treating the obtained pro duct with mineral acids in suitable organic solvents to ob tain the free d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid. The cinchonidine salt of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid containing about 9.5 to about 14 by weight of an amide selected from formamide, monomethyl formamide, dimethylformamide, monoehtylformamide, di ethylformamide, monomethylacetamide and dimethylacet amide and the preparation thereof.
