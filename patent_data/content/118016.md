# Modular nuclear reactor for a land based power plant and method for the fabrication, installation and operation thereof.

## Abstract
A self contained modular nuclear reactor which can be prefabricated at a factory location, nuclear certified at the factory, transported to a field location for final assembly and connection to a large scale electric power generating facility. The modular reactor includes a prefabricated nuclear heat supply module and a plurality of shell segments which can be assembled about the heat supply module and which provide a form for the pouring and curing of a cementatious biological shield about the heat supply module. The modular reactor includes passive shutdown heat removal systems sufficient to render the reactor safe in an emergency. A large scale power plant arrangement is disclosed which incorporates a plurality of the modular reactors.
