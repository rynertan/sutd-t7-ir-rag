# Modular spacecraft system.

## Abstract
A modular spacecraft system adapted for orbital flight is capable of expansion by the connection of at least two substantially identical spacecraft modules 20 , each of which is capable of independent operation. Each spacecraft module comprises a spacecraft body 21 , at least one solar array 44, 46 extendible outwardly from the spacecraft body, and at least one structural interface means 36 for connecting one spacecraft module to another spacecraft module. Methods for deployment of a spacecraft system utilizing a reusable space vehicle are also disclosed.
