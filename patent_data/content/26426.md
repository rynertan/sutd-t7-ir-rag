## Description
Fuel oil rotary burnerThe present invention refers to a fuel oil rotary burner, of the type including a hollow rotary shaft, terminating at its outer free end , with a truncated cone atomizer cap, enclosed in an air impeller centrifugal device, having a fuel oil feed tube inside said hollow shaft, driven by a pump and from an outer reservoir to the burner in its free end, this feed tube has a fuel oil output head and the other end of the aforesaid feed tube is connected to the feed pipe of the fuel oil from the pump, and to a return pipe connected to the reservoir.In known fuel oil rotary burners, there is permanently a great flow in the return circuit of the fuel oil, even when the burner is working. Also, there is always a part of the fuel oil which does not flow at the end of the fuel oil feed tube, which produces im regularities on igniting.The burner object of the present invention complete lyeliminates these disadvantages, enabling a pump to be used with almost half the conventional power. In essence, this burner is characterized in that the feed tube is divided by a longitudinal diametrical partition which forms a feed duct of the fuel oil, in the direction of the head, and a return duct, in the direction of the opposite end to the head, said tube being provided with a chamber adjacent to the head, in which both halves of the tube commuhicate, and which is provided with an outlet of the fuel oil.In this opening, there is a desmodromic, or positive control valve, guided by a shank1 crossing the supply tube axially, which is subjected, at its other end, to the action of a compression spring which tends to keep the valve against the opening of the head, in its closed position.Other advantages and characteristics of the burner object of the present invention will be derived from the description made hereinbelow in relation to the annexed drawings, which illustrate1 by way of unlimited example, a form of embodiment thereof. Figure 1 is a side elevation view, cut along a middle vertical plane, of the rotary burner assembly Figure 2 shows a cross section of the feed tube of the burner taken along lines II II of Figure 1 andFigure 3 is a diagram of the complete c2cuitof he homer. As mentioned above, the fuel oil rotary burner conce ned is of the type which include a hollow rotary shaft 1, terminating at its free outer end, with a trur cated cone atomizer cap 2, enclosed in an air impeller centrifugal device 3.Inside the aforesaid hollow shaft 1, there is a fuel oil feed tube 4, which is driven by a pump 5 Fig.3 , and extending from an outer reservoir 6 to the burner. This feed tube 4 is provided, at its free end, with an outlet head 7 of the fusel oil, the other end of said feed tube 4 bering connected to the feed pipes 8 of the fuel oil from the pump 5 and to a return pipe 9 connected to the reservoir 6.The feed pipe 4 is divided, by a longitudinal diametrical partition 10 Fig. 2 , which forms a feed duct 11 of the fuel oil, in the direction of the outlet head 7, and a return duct 12, in the direction towards the opposite end of the head 7, said tube 4 being provided urith a chamber 13, adjacent to the head 7, in which both halves 11 and 12 of the tube 4 com municate. This chamber 13 is provided nrith an outlet 14 of the fuel oil, a desmodromic, or positive control valve 15 being provided, guided by a shank 16, said shank passing axially along feed tube 4, and being subjected at its other end, to the action of a compression spring 17, which tends to keep the control valve 15 against the outlet 14 of the head 7, in its closed position0The head 7 is provided with a device 18 for the electrical ignition of the burner, comprising an electrode fixed to the wall of the feed tube 4 and insulated from the same, whose end is near to the edge of the head 7, a spark being produced , as desidered, in the outlet area of the fuel oil, which leads to the ignition of the burner.In the return pipe 9 connected to the reservdir 6 Fig. 3 , there is a single pressure valve 19 for regulating the fuel oil flow. Men the desmodromic, or positive control valve 15 is in its closed position and the drive pump 5 of the fuel oil is operating, a closed circuit is established through which the fuel oil flows, and which comprises reservoir 6, pump 5, feed pipe 8, feed tube 4, formed by feed duct 11 and return duct 12, return pipe 9 and pressure valve 19, for regulating the flow so that uthen the desmodromic or positive control valve 15 is in the open position, the return flow to the reservoir 6 drops, and nearly all the pumped fuel oil leaves through the head 7 of the feed tube 4. We can therefore see that with the burner object of the present invention, the advantages enumerated above are obtained, i.e. that with a less powerful pump, practically half the power required in knoxm systems, the fu el oil is shiftedr this always being hot, even at the start of the cycle.
