# A positionable element driving circuit.

## Abstract
This positionabie element driving circuit for driving a positionable element compensates supplied voltage posi tion characteristics of a bimorph type piezoelectric element which is used in a track following type video tape recorder reproducer and which displaces position of a video head. The supplied voltage to the bimorph type piezoelectric ele ment is generated by an operational circuit which detects the track position to the video head. The circuit of the present invention compensates non linearity and maintains tracking, when the video tape recorder reproducer is switched from one mode to another, e.g. from a still motion mode to a quick motion mode.
