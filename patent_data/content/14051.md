## Description
DESCRIPTION This invention relates to an end fitting assembly for a convoluted conduit. According to the present invention there is provided an end fitting assembly for a convoluted conduit comprising a nipple portion adapted for insertion into an end of said conduit, an abutment surface on said nipple portion adapted to engage said conduit end, a securing sleeve adapted to overlay said nipple portion entered into said conduit, and engagement means acting between said nipple portion and said sleeve to draw said nipple portion said sleeve together to clamp a rucked portion of the conduit between said sleeve and said abutment surface. The end fitting assembly may be provided with means for limiting relative movement of the nipple portion and the sleeve when the rucked portion has been clamped. The limiting means may comprise an additional abutment surface of the nipple portion and an abutment surface of the sleeve. The engagement means may be adapted to engage the sleeve and may be provided with a flange for engagement with the sleeve. The engagement means may comprise a cylindrical nut and the said flange may extend radially inwardlyof the nut. The nipple portion and the sleeve may be provided with convoluted surfaces for engagement with the conduit. The nipple portion may be provided with an inner circumferential recess. The assembly may be provided with sealing means for sealing the assembly and the conduit and the sealing means may comprise an annular member located on the nipple portion. Following is a description, by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings, of one method of carrying the invention into effect. In the drawings FIGURE 1 is an elevation, shown partly in cross section, of one embodiment of an assembly in accordance with the present invention, and FIGURE 2 is an elevations shown partly in cross section, of another embodiment of the assembly. Referring to FIGURE 1 of the drawings, there is shown an end fitting assembly 9 comprising a nipple 10 having a front end wall ii and a rear end wall 12. The nipple 10 is provided with a first outer circumferential surface i3 adjacent the front end wall li, an intermediate outer circumferential surface 14 which is of smaller diameter than the portion having the first outer circumferential surface 13 thereby providing an abutment surface 15. The nipple 10 has a rear outer circumferential surface 16 of smaller diameter than the intermediate outer circumferential surface 14 thereby providing an abutment suriace 17.The rear outer circumferential surface 16 is provided with a circumferential recess 18 adjacent the abutment surface 17 and a helical groove 19 extending axially rearwardly from the recess 18. The nipple 10 has a bore 20 which is enlarged at a forward end thereof thereby providing an inner circumferential recess 21. The nipple 10 is adapted to co operate with a sleeve 22 having a front end wall 23 and a rear end wall 24. The sleeve 22 has a first outer circumferential surface 25 adjacent the front end wall 23 and an intermediate outer circumferential surface 26 of reduced di ameter adjacent the first outer circumferential surface 25 thereby providing an abutment surface 27. The sleeve 22 is provided with a rear outer circumferential surface 28 of smaller diameter than the intermediate circumferential surface 26. The sleeve 22 has a bore 29 provided with a helical groove 30. The bore 29 is enlarged at a forward end thereof thereby providing an inner circumferential recess 31 having a radial end wall 32. The sleeve 22 is adapted to co operate with a cylindrical nut 33 adapted to operate with a threaded component not shown . The nut 33 is provided with an inwardly extending circumferential flange 34. The assembly is adapted to engage a tubular member 35 of plastics material and having internal convolutions complimentary to the helical groove 19 of the nipple 10 and having external convolutions complimentary to the helical groove 30 of the sleeve 22. The assembly 9 is assembled on an end portion of the tubular member 35 by screwing the sleeve 22 axially of the tubular member 35, the helical groove 30 of the sleeve 22 being engaged by the external convolutions of the tubular member 35, so that aw end portion of the tubular member 35 extends axially from the front end wall 23 of the sleeve 22 The rear end wall 12 of the nipple 10 then is inserted into the bore of the end portion of the tubular member 35 and the nipple 10 is screwed into the tubular member 35 , the helical groove 19 being engaged by the int ernal convolutions of the tubular member 35. When the abutment surface 17 of the nipple 10 engages an adjacent end wall of the tubular member 55 and the nipple 10 subsequently is screwed axially inwardly of the tubular member 35, the convolutions adjacent the end wall of the tubular member 35 are contracted axially and expanded radially outwardly. The sleeve 22 then is screwed on the tubular member 35 so that the end wall 32 of the sleeve 22 approaches the abutment surface 17 of the nipple 10.Continued rotation of the sleeve 22 in the same direction reduces the distance between the abutment surface i7 of the nipple 10 and the end wall 35 of the tubular member 35 until the axially contracted and radially expanded convolutions are clamped between the abutment surface 17 and the end wall 32. Rotation of the sleeve 22 is continued until the iront end wall 23 of the sleeve 22 engages the abutment surface 15 of the nipple 10. In this manner, the tubular member 35 is firmly gripped between the nipple 10 and the sleeve 22 and the nipple 10 and sleeve 22 are maintained in the clamping position by means of the nut 33 which is screwed on a component not shown whereby the flange 34 of the nut 33 engages the abutment surface 27 of the sleeve 22 thereby preventing relative axial movement of the nipple 10 and sleeve 22. Referring now to FIGURE 2 of the drawings, there is shown the end fitting assembly 9 having inserted therein an annular seal 36 of deformable material, such as elastomeric material. The seal 36 is located on the intermediate outer circumferential surface 14 before the nipple 10 is screwed into the tubular member 35. When the assembly 9 is assembled on the end portion of the tubular member 35, the seal 36 provides a pressure tight seal between the convolutions clamped between the abutment surface 17 and the end wall 32 on the one hand and the nipple 10 on the other hand.
