This invention relates to a load supporting frame. A frame 10, 11, 12 has load supporting means e.g. in the form of filaments 13 stretched between opposite frame sides 10, 11 and a variable tensioning device comprising a spinal column of links 15 secured to one end of the filaments 13 and connected to the adjacent frame side 11 by springs 16 and by a variable tension coupling comprising a carriage 17 slidable along the flexible column of links 15 , a slider 23 slidable along the frame side 11 , a screw connection 21, 24 connecting the slider 23 to the carriage 17 and operable to vary the tension in the filaments adjacent thereto. The frame can provide variable position lumbar support in the back rest of a vehicle seat.
