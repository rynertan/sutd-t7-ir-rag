# Helicoidal guide for wire electrode of an EDM apparatus.

## Abstract
An adjustable and controllable electrode wire support and guide mechanism for traveling wire EDM apparatus wherein an electrode wire 12 , longitudinally fed, is stretched between a pair of support and guide members 26, 28 , and wherein at least one of the support and guide members 26, 28 , is in the form of a helically grooved cylindrical member directly driven by a servo motor 38, 40 . The helical groove 30 defines guiding surfaces for the electrode wire 12 which is in engagement with opposite sidewalls of the groove 30 and, by rotating the helically grooved support and guide member 26, 28 by the servo motor 38, 40 , the electrode wire is caused to take a predetermined inclination relative to the workpiece 14 . The invention permits to reduce the number of moving parts required for inclining an electrode wire to two elements only which provide a precise guiding for the electrode wire, which considerably reduce play, backlash and other errors due to geometric imperfections of the conventional slides and cross lides normally, used for varying the inclination of wire electrodes in traveling wire EDM apparatus.
