# Discharge tube firing circuit.

## Abstract
The disclosed firing circuit comprises a fluorescent lamp 10 serially connected with an inductive stabilizer 12, a first semiconductor switch 18 including an SCR 18 1 connected across tne fluorescent lamp, and a nonlinear dielectric element 16 serially connected with a parallel combination of a PNPN switch 24 as a second semiconductor switch and a discharging circuit 26 across the fluorescent lamp. The discharging circuit may comprise a semiconductor diode or a PNPN switch. The discharging circuit may alternatively comprise a Zener diode and a resistor serially intercon nected.
