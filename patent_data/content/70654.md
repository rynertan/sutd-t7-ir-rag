# MOTION CONTROLLER

## Abstract
A motion controller is described that provides accurate control of DC servo motors. The motion controller provides complete control of motor speed, direction, acceleration, de celeration and position as programmed by the user. The user defines the unique motions by generating chords. Groups of the chords are combined to form motion profiles. The profiles are interrelated via a high level language to form functional areas that combine to generate an overall control. Adjustable gain, conditional logic, programmable con troller intervention, dwells, and output information are all uti lized to facilitate program generation. An interconnectable programmable panel allows user access to the controller. The motion controller further has a manual operation mode.
