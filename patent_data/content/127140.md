## Description
The present invention relates to an information holding device according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a device is known from US 42 21471. In particular, it relates to an information holding device capable of outputting stored information to an external device. In the past, a device made of a liquid crystal having a smectic phase with a display function and an information holding function and a device made of a dielectric material such as PLZT have been known as the information holding devices. Hereinbelow, a liquid crystal device having the display function and the information holding function will be explained as an example of the information holding device. The liquid crystal devices of various display principles including a liquid crystal having a nematic phase, a liquid crystal having a cholesteric phase or a liquid crystal having a smectic phase have been known. In those devices, the orientations of liquid crystal molecules are changed by an external field and the resulting change of an optical property is used to display the information. As an example of such liquid crystal devices, a thermal writing type liquid crystal device disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,796,999 Locally Erasable Thermo Optic Smectic Liquid Crystal Storage Displays will be outlined below. In the disclosed device, transparent electrodes 13 and 14 are arranged on the inner surfaces of a pair of glass substrates 11 and 12 as shown in Fig. 1 a , and the space between them is filled with a liquid crystal 15 having a smectic phase. A laser beam 16 emitted from an Ar argon laser or a YAG yttrium aluminum garnet laser is focused on the display panel through a lens 17 to heat the smectic liquid crystal 15 of an area 18 to be displayed, thereby rendering it an isotropic liquid crystal phase once. Then, the laser beam is removed to quickly cool the liquid crystal to the smectic phase. As a result, the orientations of the liquid crystal molecules are disturbed and a region 19 which exhibits a strong scattering property is produced as shown in Fig. 1 b . Since this scattered state persists stably, a desired image information can be stored. Based on the display principle described above, the thermal writing type display device can write a desired image information on the liquid crystal elements by the scan and the modulation of the laser beam, and local erasure is attained by the application of an electric field. Thus, it is perferable as a display device, but it does not have a function to read out the stored image information and it is merely used as a display device for inputting an information signal as an image. The other known liquid crystal devices e.g., USP 4,196,974 also have only the function of displaying the image and they are not used as the information output devices. From prior art document US A 4 221 471 a liquid crystal memory device is known. A dielectric held inbetween two electrodes provides different capacities between the two electrodes in accordance with different optical states. A capacitance detector 64 is used to measure the capacitance between the electrodes. Later published document EP A 0117535 discloses an information holding device, where a plurality of capacitors are arranged in a matrix. When reading out the respective capacitance values, each of the columns of the matrix is either provided with separate detectors and signal generators, or for the whole matrix only one capacitance detector and signal generator is provided, which selectively is switched to the single columns. Document US 4 242 736 discloses a matrix arrangement of semiconductor capacitors, each of which can assume two different capacitance values. In a reading operation, the capacitance values are read out one by one, and each row is provided with separate means for detecting the respective capacitance value. An object of the present invention is to provide an information holding device capable of reading out information in a short time. This object is accomplished in accordance with claim 1. Hereinbelow, the present invention will be described in detail by taking as an example a liquid crystal having a smectic A phase. Fig. 2 shows a diagram of the general arrangement of a liquid crystal device according to an embodiment of the present invention. Picture information writing means 21 is means for changing the capacitance of a liquid crystal having a smectic A phase as serves as the dielectric of the opposing part between one electrode and the other electrode of substrates, thereby to write picture information such as characters and symbols into a liquid crystal panel 22. The picture information written in the liquid crystal panel 22 is read out by a picture information reading voltage generator circuit 20 which generates a voltage varying with time to be applied to the liquid crystal in the opposing part of the electrodes, and a picture information detector circuit 23 which detects principally a displacement current flowing through the dielectric of the opposing part of the electrodes. The picture information read out is sent to a picture signal converter circuit 24. A picture information signal produced here is fed into an external circuit 25 which is composed of, for example, a microprocessor CPU . Next, the arrangements and operations of the respective portions will be described. A schematic sectional view of the liquid crystal panel 22 is shown in Fig. 3, while a schematic plan view is shown in Fig. 4. In the liquid crystal panel, a gap of about 10 µm is defined between a pair of substrates 26 and 27 which have a plurality of Y electrodes 29 and a plurality of X electrodes 30 juxtaposed on their opposing surfaces in a manner to intersect each other, and a liquid crystal 31 having a smectic A phase is contained between the substrates and is healed by a spacer 28. Here, the opposing parts between the Y electrodes 29 and the X electrodes 30 become picture elements and form a matrix as a whole. The substrates 26 and 27 may be glass plates or plastic plates, or the non viewing substrate may be an opaque substrate such as a Si substrate and the viewing substrate may be a transparent substrate such as a glass plate or a plastic plate. The electrodes may be transparent conductive films such as of a mixture of indium oxide and tin oxide, usually called nesa films , or the electrode on the viewing substrate may be the nesa film and the other electrode may be a metal such as Aℓ or Cr. The liquid crystal material may be a mixture of substances generally expressed by where R is an alkali radical which exhibit a positive dielectric anisotropy and the smectic A phase at room temperatures and changes from the smectic phase to a nematic phase at 42 C and from the nematic phase to an isotropic liquid phase at 45 C. Other liquid crystals having the smectic A phase are a mixture of 4, 4 alchoxy biphenyl carboxylic acid alkyl ester and 4, 4 alkyl cyanotran and a mixture of 4 alchoxy phenyl 4 alkyl benzoic acid ester and p,p alkyl cyano biphenyl. When dichronic dye is added to the liquid crystal, a viewing angle property of display is improved and it is desirable to the display device. Fig. 5 shows an optical characteristic of the liquid crystal having the smectic phase. When the liquid crystal having the smectic phase is heated, it is changed into an isotropic liquid phase point On the other hand, when the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer is set to or around zero volt, liquid crystal molecules are oriented at random with respect to the substrates, so that the liquid crystal layer exhibits a smectic phase having a scattering property point The present inventors have acknowledged that when the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer having the nematic phase is changed in the course of cooling of the liquid crystal layer, the amount of scatter changes so that a tonality can be imparted to the display. The inventors have also acknowledged that the capacitance of such liquid crystal having the smectic phase does not substantially change for several days to several months after the electric field or the heat has been removed. Interfaces between the electrodes 29 and 30 and the liquid crystal 31 having the smectic phase are treated with a silane surface active agent so that they are homeotropically oriented, that is, the liquid crystal molecules having the smectic phase are oriented in a direction perpendicularly to the substrates, although they may be oriented in a direction parallel to the substrates. The liquid crystal material is not limited to the liquid crystal having the smectic phase, but it may be other liquid crystal such as a liquid crystal having a cholesteric phase whose orientation is changed by the application of an external field and retained for a predetermined time period after the external field has been removed. Next, the picture information writing means 21 will be described. Figs. 6 and 7 show means for writing picture information by projecting a laser beam on the liquid crystal panel which employs the liquid crystal having the smectic phase. The means of Fig. 6 is provided with a laser pen 33 which can condense the laser beam on any desired position. The laser pen 33 to be used is, for example, one which is constructed of an optical fiber for guiding the laser beam from a light source and a condensing lens, or one in which a semiconductor laser 34 and a condensing lens 35 are made unitary. The inventors have experimentally confirmed that the writing of picture information can be achieved by condensing laser power which is at least 10 mW on the surface of the liquid crystal element. Fig. 7 shows another picture information writing means. It is constructed of a laser 36, a modulator 37 which modulates the laser beam, a deflector 38 for the X direction and the Y direction which deflects the laser beam in any desired direction, and a lens 39 which condenses the laser beam on the surface of the liquid crystal element. The laser 36 which the inventors use is, for example, a YAG laser whose power is 1 W in the single mode and whose beam spread angle is within 1 mrad. An acoustooptic modulator is employed as the modulator 37. By way of example, a plane mirror galvanometer whose angle can be controlled by the quantity of current is used as the deflector 38. In either system, the laser beam is absorbed by the electrodes 29 or the electrodes 30, and the electrodes are heated. As a result, the liquid crystal having the smectic phase is also heated to change into the isotropic liquid phase. When the laser beam is subsequently removed, the liquid crystal is rapidly cooled to change into the smectic phase again via the nematic phase. At this time, the orientation direction of the liquid crystal molecules is disordered, and the liquid crystal scatters external light and falls into a write state because this scattered state continues to exist stably. Further, the part of the liquid crystal not irradiated with the laser beam exhibits the initial state non write stage and is in the transparent state. In bringing the whole area of the liquid crystal panel into the initial state unwrite state , the purpose can be attained in such a way that a D.C. voltage or A.C. voltage is applied across the Y electrodes 29 and X electrodes 30 after the whole area of the liquid crystal panel has been heated or that a sufficiently high D.C. voltage or A.C. voltage is applied without heating. Next, another embodiment of the picture information writing means for the liquid crystal panel which employs the liquid crystal having the smectic phase is illustrated in Fig. 8. The structure of the liquid crystal panel 46 is the same as that of the liquid crystal panel shown in Fig. 4. Switches 42a 42c are connected to the terminals on one side, of Y electrodes 43a 43c formed on one substrate, while the terminals thereof on the other side are connected to GND 0 V . Further, switch pairs 41a 41c are connected to X electrodes 44a 44c formed on the other substrate. A heating power source 47 is connected to the switches 42a 42c, while a driver circuit 40 is connected to the switch pairs 41a 41c. The driver circuit 40 produces a selecting voltage V V Here, in a case where, among the picture elements of the liquid crystal panel 46, hatched ones e₁₂, e₁₃, e₂₁, e₂₃, e₃₁ and e₃₂ are assumed to be in the write state scattering state and the others e₁₁, e₂₂ and e₃₃ in the non write state transparent state , voltages shown in Fig. 9 are applied to the X electrodes 44a 44c and the Y electrodes 43a 43c. In the state in which all the switch pairs 41a 41c are turned off , the switch 42a is turned on for a fixed time so as to apply a heating voltage V Subsequently, when the switch 42a is turned off to remove the heating voltage V The operations stated above are similarly performed as to the Y electrodes 43b and 43c in succession. As will be described later, the picture elements of a plurality of rows may well be selected at the same time. Fig. 10 shows another embodiment of the means for writing picture information, while Fig. 11 is a diagram showing the operating timings thereof. In Fig. 10, numeral 200 designates an X electrode driver circuit, and numeral 210 a Y electrode driver circuit. The circuit 210 consists of two channel switching elements which change over a voltage generating source V In the present embodiment, voltages as shown in Fig. 11 are applied to the left terminal parts of the Y electrodes Y₁, Y₂, ..... Y While, in the present embodiment, the voltage waveform of 1 2 V Next, the principle of a method of reading out picture information will be described. As stated before, the liquid crystal having the smectic phase for use in the present embodiment exhibits the positive dielectric anisotropy. That is, the relationship between the specific inductivity ε In the non write state thus far described, accordingly, the liquid crystal molecules are oriented perpendicularly to the electrodes, and the specific inductivity of the liquid crystal layer is approximately equal to the specific inductivity ε Besides, in the write state, the orientation direction of the liquid crystal molecules is conspicuously disordered. Assuming that the orientation direction be completely random, the specific inductivity of the liquid crystal layer becomes close to the three dimensional average value Here, when the picture elements e₁₁ e₃₃ arranged in the shape of the matrix as shown in Fig. 8 are considered as a kind of capacitors, the liquid crystal panel 46 can be deemed a group of capacitors 48 as shown in Fig. 13. Since, at this time, the respective picture elements are filled with the liquid crystal layer being the dielectric between the electrodes, their capacitances differ owing to the unequal dielectric constants caused by the different molecular orientations between in the write state and in the non write state as described before. Accordingly, the capacitance C The inventors measured the capacitances by the use of a liquid crystal material of ε Besides, in a case where the liquid crystal material having the positive dielectric anisotropy is used and where the initial orientation is rendered the horizontal orientation, C As stated above, the picture element in the write state and that in the non write state have unequal capacitances. By electrically reading out the difference of the capacitances, therefore, the written information can be recognized and outputted to an external device. There will now be explained embodiments of the picture information reading voltage generator circuit 20, the picture information detector circuit 23 and the picture information signal converter circuit 24 which are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 13 shows one embodiment of the information reading method holding device according to the invention. The liquid crystal panel 22 is such that picture elements e₁₁ e₃₉ are expressed by the equivalent circuit of capacitors. Electrodes consist of X electrodes 2a 2i and Y electrodes 4a 4c. Selection switches 9a 9c apply a capacitance reading voltage V It is assumed here that, among the picture elements, those e₁₁, e₁₄ and e₁₇ have their picture information read out simultaneously. To this end, the Y electrode 4a is supplied with the reading voltage V In addition, selection switches 8a 8i are connected to the X electrodes 2a 2i. One terminal of each of these selection switches is connected to a constant voltage source 54 which generates a constant voltage V Further, capacitance discriminating circuits 56a 56c are respectively connected to the current to voltage converter circuits 55a 55c. Information signals D The selection switches 8a 8i either apply the constant voltage V In Fig. 13, the X electrodes 2a, 2d and 2g are respectively connected to the current to voltage converter circuits 55a, 55b and 55c, and the other X electrodes 2b, 2c, 2e, 2f, 2h and 2i are connected to the constant voltage source 54. The present embodiment of such arrangement is characterized in that the switches for selecting the currents flowing through the electrodes are divided into a plurality of blocks in Fig. 13, three blocks I, II and III . The present embodiment is also characterized in that principally displacement currents in the currents flowing through the picture elements e₁₁ e₃₉ have their magnitudes discriminated so as to detect capacitances. Figs. 14 and 15 show practicable examples of the current to voltage converter circuits 55a 55c and the capacitance discriminating circuits 56a 56c according to the invention. Further, Figs. 16 a to 16 c show voltage waveforms in various parts of Figs. 14 and 15. Referring to Figs. 14 and 15, when the picture element is regarded as a capacitance C and the reading voltage is applied to the electrode 4a, a displacement current Figs. 16 a to 16 c show the situation at the time at which the capacitance of the picture element e₁₁ is read out. Here, the capacitances of the picture elements e₁₁, e₂₁ and e₃₁ are denoted by C₁₁, c₂₁ and C₃₁ respectively. It is assumed by way of example that the reading voltage V as shown in Fig. 16 a , and that a wiring resistance r₁ and a wiring resistance r₂ be sufficiently small. Then, the displacement current Now, assuming C₀ C₂₁ C₃₁ in Fig. 16 b , the following holds The displacement current i t is evaluated by the La place transform etc. from Equations 2 and 3 , as follows Here, putting then the following holds From Equation 4 , i t 0 0 and As shown in Fig. 16 c , accordingly, the detection of the displacement current Although the picture information may well be read out by detecting the displacement current Further, the detection of the displacement current Even when the reading voltage V The orientation state of the liquid crystal molecules changes when a voltage not lower than a specified threshold value has been applied. Therefore, the reading voltage V The current to voltage converter circuit 55a 55c converts the aforementioned displacement current Besides, the capacitance discriminating circuit 56a 56c is constructed of a comparator 62 and compares the output v Here, as shown in Fig. 16 c , the output v Next, the operation of the circuit shown in Fig. 13 will be described with reference to Fig. 17. It is assumed that the picture elements e₁₁, e₁₂, e₁₃, e₁₇, e₁₈, e₁₉, e₂₁, e₂₂, e₂₃, e₂₇, e₂₈, e₂₉, e₃₁, e₃₂, e₃₃, e₃₇, e₃₈ and e₃₉ of the blocks I and III be in the non write state, whereas the picture elements e₁₄, e₁₅, e₁₆, e₂₄, e₂₅, e₂₆, e₃₄, e₃₅ and e₃₆ of the block II be in the write state. Now, the selector switches 9a 9c are assumed to select the reading voltage V On the other hand, the selector switches 8a 8i are assumed to provide the current detector circuits 14a 14c with the displacement currents For example, the operation in a period of time t₀ t₃ will be observed. In a period t₀ t₁, the magnitude of the output v That is, the capacitances of the three picture elements e₁₁, e₁₄ and e₁₇ are detected at the same time. Likewise, in a period t₁ t₂, the magnitudes of the outputs v When the outputs v After the picture information signals D The operations above described are repeated three times. Meanwhile, by endowing the shift registers 59a 59c with the shifting function, the output D₀ of the shift register 59a becomes values determined by the capacitances of the respective picture elements in the sequence of e₁₁ ..... e₁₉, e₂₁ ..... e₂₉, and e₃₁ ..... e₃₉ in synchronism with a clock signal CP₂. The reading operation can be rendered higher in speed by reading out the picture elements in block unit in this manner. While, in the embodiment of Fig. 13, the picture elements have been divided into the three blocks so as to simultaneously detect the capacitances of the three rows of picture elements, they may well be divided into two blocks or into four, five, ..... blocks. Figure 18 shows an embodiment in which the information writing and reading circuits thus far described are made unitary. Selector switches 103₁ 103 Selector switches 102₁ 102 Further, switches 106₁ 106 Here, when picture information is to be written, the selector switches 102₁ 102 In the present embodiment, the writing with a laser beam can be jointly employed. All the switches 106₁ 106 On the other hand, when information is to be read out, the selector switches 102₁ 102 According to the present embodiment, it becomes possible that any desired picture is written into and displayed on a liquid crystal panel from an external circuit on the basis of the heat generation of electrodes, that an observer or user supplements, revises or deletes information with a laser pen at will, and that the information is read out to be delivered to an external circuit. Fig. 19 shows another embodiment of picture information reading. The electrodes 124 of the liquid crystal panel 22 on the other side hereinbelow, called X electrodes are divided into two blocks, and the electrodes 125 on one side hereinbelow, called Y electrodes in two rows are connected in common outside or inside the panel, whereby the capacitances of two rows of picture elements are simultaneously detected. The read out scanning circuit 20 is constructed of selector switches 9a 9c, a voltage source circuit 52 for generating a reading voltage V On the other hand, a picture information detector circuit 23a is constructed of selector switches 8a 8c, a vertical scanning circuit 57a, a constant voltage source 54a for providing a voltage V Further, a picture information detector circuit 23b has the same construction as that of the aforementioned picture information detector circuit 23a. Fig. 20 shows operations in Fig. 19 as a time chart. Here will be explained the operations in the case of selecting the Y electrodes 125a and 125d at the same time. To this end, a control signal L₁ from the horizontal scanning circuit 51 is set at an H level and control signals L₂ and L₃ are set at an L level, to apply the reading voltage V On the other hand, control signals S₁ S₃ from the vertical scanning circuit 57a are successively rendered the H level, to successively supply the current to voltage converter circuits 55a, 55b with displacement currents flowing through the X electrodes. By comparing the resulting signals CP Although no illustration is made in the drawing, the signals CP By simultaneously applying the reading voltage V Fig. 21 shows another embodiment of the reading of picture information. The point of difference from the embodiment of Fig. 19 is that each of the X electrodes is provided with a current to voltage converter circuit 55 and a capacitance discriminating circuit 56 so as to read out capacitances every line. The same effects as in the foregoing are achieved. Fig. 22 shows another embodiment in the case where the information writing and reading circuits are made unitary. Selector switches 118a 118c are connected to Y electrodes 125. A write in scanning circuit 100 is connected to one input terminal of each of the selector switches, while the read out scanning circuit 20 is connected to the other input terminal. Further, selector switches 103a 103f are connected to X electrodes 124. An X electrode driver circuit 104a or 104b is connected to one input terminal of each of the selector switches, while a picture information detector circuit 23a or 23b is connected to the other input terminal. Here, the operation of writing information will be described. Fig. 23 schematically illustrates the processes of the heating and cooling of the smectic liquid crystal and the situations of the applied voltages of the X electrodes 124 and Y electrodes 125. At this time, the selector switches 118a 118c shown in Fig. 22 select the write in scanning circuit 100, and the selector switches 103a 103f select the X electrode driver circuits 104a, 104b. When the liquid crystal device is irradiated with a laser beam for a predetermined time T When the laser beam is subsequently removed, the liquid crystal layer is rapidly cooled to change from the isotropic liquid phase into the smectic phase via the nematic phase. At this time, the voltages V In contrast, when the voltages applied to the X electrodes and Y electrodes are rendered antiphase to bring the voltage between both the electrodes into an A.C. voltage of V In this regard, the inventors have acknowledged that the V It has also been acknowledged that the liquid crystal device becomes the substantially transparent state when V Fig. 24 shows another embodiment in the case of making the information writing and reading circuits unitary. The difference from the embodiment of Fig. 22 lies in the writing operation. Accordingly, the information writing operation will be briefly explained with reference to Fig. 25. In order to establish the write state, the selector switches 103a 103f are brought into the open state, and the switch 106a is brought into the on state. Here, a heating voltage V Conversely, in order to establish the non write state, in the cooling process mentioned above, the switch 106a is brought into the off state, whereupon pulses having opposite phases and voltage values of V The value of V Fig. 26 shows another embodiment in the case of making the information writing and reading circuits unitary. The write scanning circuit 100, the read scanning circuit 101, the X electrode driver circuits 104a, 104b and the picture information detector circuits 23a, 23b operate similarly to the respective circuits shown in Fig. 24. The X electrodes of a liquid crystal panel 57 are divided into three blocks, and the Y electrodes of each block are connected in common. That is, the capacitances of three rows of picture elements are simultaneously detected. Two rows or the three rows are not restrictive, but the capacitances of four or more rows of picture elements may well be simultaneously detected. Fig. 27 shows another embodiment in the case where the information writing and reading circuits are made unitary. The write scanning circuit 100, the read scanning circuit 101, the X electrode driver circuits 104a, 104b and the picture information detector circuits 23a, 23b perform the same operations as those of the respective circuits shown in Fig. 24. In the present embodiment, the capacitances of the picture elements of two adjacent rows are simultaneously detected. However, this is not restrictive but the capacitances of the picture elements of three, four, ..... adjacent rows may well be simultaneously detected. Fig. 28 shows an embodiment of a practicable circuit arrangement in the case where the information writing and reading circuits are made unitary. The collector terminals of PNP transistors 203 and 204 are connected in common, and the node is grounded through a resistor 205. In addition, the node is connected to one end of a Y electrode 200. In the present embodiment, one picture element will be explained as an example. The base of the transistor 203 is supplied with a control signal ø₂ through a resistor 202a, and the emitter with a reading voltage V Connected to the other end of the Y electrode 200 is the collector of an NPN transistor 198, the emitter of which is grounded. The base of this transistor is supplied with a control signal ø₃ through a resistor 199. An electronic switch 206 composed of an N channel MOS transistor 206a and a P channel MOS transistor 206b, and an electronic switch 207 composed of an N channel MOS transistor 207a and a P channel MOS transistor 207b are connected to an X electrode 201. Further, a selecting voltage V Fig. 29 illustrates the operations of the circuit arrangement shown in Fig. 28. In writing information into a liquid crystal panel, only the control signals ø₁ and ø₃ are first set at an H level. As a result, only the transistors 202b and 198 are turned on , and the Y electrode 200 is heated. Subsequently, all the control signals ø₁ ø₃ are set at an L level to turn off the transistors 204, 203 and 198. In case of bringing the picture element into the non write state, a control signal ø₄ is set at the H level so as to apply the non selecting voltage V On the other hand, in reading out information written in the liquid crystal panel, the control signal ø₂ is set at the H level to turn on the transistor 203. Further, the control signal ø₄ is set at the H level to turn on the electronic switch 207. The switch 209 is adapted to select the current to voltage converter circuit 210 at this time. As a result, the reading voltage V In any of the embodiments, the cap citances of a plurality of liquid crystal picture elements can be simultaneously read out, so that an information reading operation at high speed is permitted. In the present embodiment, the liquid crystal having the smectic phase has been exemplified and explained. As stated before, however, the present invention is applicable to any dielectric, such as a liquid crystal having a cholesteric phase or PLZT, whose capacitance is changed by applying an electric field or heat and is stored without change for a fixed time even after the electric field or the heat has been removed. The means for changing the capacitances of the dielectrics is not restricted to the heating means, but may be any means adapted to change the capacitances of the dielectrics, such as electric field means or current means. As the means for detecting the capacitances, besides the method described before in which the displacement currents are detected by applying the time varying reading voltage, there is, for example, a method in which the changes of impedances are detected by causing currents to flow through picture elements. When some or all of the electrodes to be formed on the substrates are made of a metal such as Cr or Al, electrode resistances can be lowered, and the rise or fall response time of the displacement current to be detected can be shortened. This is well suited for fast read out. As described above, according to the present invention, an information holding device which is made of a dielectric such as smectic liquid crystal is endowed with the function of reading out information fast in a short time, whereby an information holding device capable of inputting outputting information can be provided.
