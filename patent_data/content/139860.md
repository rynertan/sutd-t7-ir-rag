# Flexible coupling using toroidal joint.

## Abstract
A flexible coupling 11 is formed with a toroidal dia phragm 21 22 as its flexible member. A pair of half toroids 21 22 are fixed to inner rings 25, 26 and outer rings 27, 28 in order to effect connections. The inner rings 25, 26 are connected, respectively, to drive shaft sections 13, 14 . The outer rings 27, 28 are used to connect the half toroids 21 22 to each other. Torque from one of the drive shaft sections 13 is passed through one of the inner rings 23 , through one of the diaphragms 21 through the outer rings 27 and 28 to the other diaphragms 22 , the other inner ring 26 and to the other drive shaft section 14 . Advantages include increased flexibility of a flexible coupling of a type which uses no bear ing parts.
