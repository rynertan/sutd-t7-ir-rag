# Disperse dyes based on isatin derivatives and process for their preparation, and their use for dyeing and printing synthetic fibres.

## Abstract
Isatin derivative suitable as disperse dyes having the general formula The disperse dyes of the invention are particularly suited for the dyeing and printing of synthetic fibres, such as polyester fibres, in shades from yellow green to orange.
