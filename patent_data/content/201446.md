# Reducing the speed of aliphatic diamine curing agents in polyurethane cements.

## Abstract
A method for preparing a polyurethane suitable for lining fuel tanks, said polyurethane having good, fuel re sistance and improved hydrolysis resistance by using a keti mine of an aliphatic diamine as a curing agent in a three component system composed of a prepolymer solution, a cement solution and a curing agent solution.
