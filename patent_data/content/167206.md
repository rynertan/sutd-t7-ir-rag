# Synthetic fraipontite and process for preparation thereof.

## Abstract
An oxide or hydroxide mixture or coprecipitate having a three component oxide compositn comprising 5 to 45 mole of SiO₂, 35 to 65 mole of ZnO and 0 to 60 mole of Aℓ₂O₃ is heated in the presence of water to form a crystal of the fraipontite type. The obtained synthetic mineral has a fraipontite type crystal structure and has a high whiteness and a large specific surface area. For example, this synthetic mineral is valuable as a color developer for a leuco dye.
