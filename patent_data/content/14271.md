# Weld monitoring apparatus and method.

## Abstract
An improved weld monitoring apparatus and a method for its use are disclosed. Specifically, the invention relates to the application of integrating voltmeters 10, 11, 12 to the monitoring of a resistance welding process wherein a blank ing pulse generator 8 is used to direct a voltage signal from the welding process to suitably adapted integrating voltmet ers 10, 11, 12.
