# SWITCHING REGULATOR

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a switching regulator including a switching transistor 6 for converting a d.c. input to an a.c. voltage, a first transistor 30 for driving said switching transistor 6 , a second transistor 38 for detecting a variation in the level of the d.c. output voltage by comparison with a reference voltage and for controlling the switching operation of said first transistor 30 according to the detected variation, and a constant voltage diode 40 for setting the operating level of said second transitor.
