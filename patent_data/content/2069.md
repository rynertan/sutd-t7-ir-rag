# Jaw type refuse collecting device.

## Abstract
A device for removal and disposal of animal excrements has an elongated handle 14 with a pistol type grip 64 at its upper end and a pair of pick up jaws 22, 24 at its lower end. A trigger 18 in the grip is linked to the pivoted jaw 24 by an actuating rod 20 which passes through the handle and is urged by a spring 76 to maintain the pivoted jaw in its open position. Squeezing the trigger pulls the actuating rod, causing the pivoted jaw to swing toward the fixed jaw 22 into its closed position. A releasable latch arrangement 80 86 maintains the trigger in its depressed position. The bottom end of disposable bag 13 is inserted between the open jaws, after which the opened portion of the bag is inverted in cuff like fashion about the outside of the open jaws. After collection of refuse in the bag by closing the movable jaw against the fixed jaw, the jaws are latched shut, then the cuffed portion of the bag is reversed off the jaws, the bag is sealed and freed for disposal by unlatching the jaws.
