# Ampule case.

## Abstract
A case made of a base sheet 2 folded into a rectangular form when seen in side elevation. Ampules A are accommodated in the case as arranged side by side at a spacing, with the bottoms of the ampules adhered to the bottom wall 2a of the case. When an ampule is to be used, a segment of the base sheet is separated off with the ampule attached thereto, along a severance line 4 formed in the base sheet between each two adjacent ampules. A side wall of the case bears the name of the preparation in the ampules and like required information, thus eliminating the necessity of printing or labeling the ampules individually.
