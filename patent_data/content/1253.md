# Tooth marking device.

## Abstract
A thin articulating film 11 which is susceptible of folding, wrinkling, crimping and the like is held taut in a generally U shaped frame 13 to which the film is permanently affixed at a part of its periphery. The edge of the film 15 spanning the ends of the arms of the frame is unframed. The frame can be integral with the film. Devices for full arch, anterior arch and quadrant occlusal adjustment, and for contact adjustment between two adjacent teeth in one arch or another where one tooth or both may be a restoration, are described.
