## Description
The present invention relates generally to an arrangement for joining together two plate shaped elements, which form an angle, usually 90 , with each other. More specifically, the invention concerns an arrangement of the type defined in the preamble of the appended claim, based on FR A 2,273,139. This FR document discloses an arrangement with an angled means which is either hollow or solid and which can be placed in U shaped elements from above or below. In the boarding of posts, girders and the like there are employed according to known engineering practice, which has changed little the last 10 20 years, boarding elements which are held together by means of various collars or the like which are fastened with relatively short intermediate spaces round the boarding and thereby hold the individual boarding elements in position. This solution is very demanding on labour and time in that the collars have to be nailed to the boarding elements and have to be renovated after use. By the very fact that the boarding work in many casting operations constitutes a substantial portion of the costs, improvements are constantly being sought after, but as mentioned above without significant changes having been made in engineering in recent years. The need for improvements is thus apparent, and the object of the present invention is to provide an arrangement by means of which boarding of corners can be effected more rapidly and simpler and hence cheaper. According to the invention, this is achieved by means of an arrangement which is of the type described by way of introduction and which has the additional features stated in the characterising clause of the appended claim. An example of the invention will be further explained in the following description having regard to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows a horizontal section of an arrangement according to the invention for use in boarding of a corner in for example a post by means of boarding cassettes where the angle a between the boarding cassettes is 90 Each boarding cassette consists of two plates 10a, 10a and 10b, 10b respectively, which are usually made of plywood and which have a certain spacing, for example 10 cm. from each other. Each of these plates can alternately face towards the concrete. Between the surfaces there is arranged along their edges a U shaped element, legs of which, such as the leg 16a, project outwardly as an extension of the plates. In addition the element is designed with an inwardly projecting flange which the plywood plates form an abutment against and which they are detachably fastened to by means of for example rivets. On boarding a corner two boarding cassettes 10a, 10b are mounted at an angle a to each other as illustrated in Fig. 1. In the illustrated embodiment the angle is as mentioned 90 Fig. 2 shows a corresponding section to Fig. 1, where there are employed boarding members 18a, 18b instead of boarding cassettes. Outwardly from each boarding member there projects substantially at right angles to this an element 19a, 19b with projections 20a, 20b which the boarding members are detachably fixed to, for example by means of rivets. The elements 19a, 19b extend over the whole respective length and breadth of the boarding member. A certain section which is not critical projects outwardly from the boarding member, but which is adapted to the length of legs 12, 13 of the angled means 11. At its free end each of the elements 19a, 19b is angled, so that the free end of the means 11 forms an abutment against angled portion 21a, 21b of the element 19a, 19b, which extends in an opposite direction relative to projection 20a, 20b of the element. In a corresponding manner as in the embodiment of Fig. 1 the angled means is fixed to the element 19a, 19b by means of bolts 22 or rivets, so that the means 11 can be detached in a simple manner from the element 19a, 19b after use. Also in this embodiment there is provided a reliable and good bracing and locking. Fig. 3 shows a perspective view of the embodiment of Fig. 2, and it is clearly evident how the angled means 11 is disposed relative to the elements 19a, 19b. In the opposite direction relative to the angled portion 21a, 21b there projects a second angled portion 23a, 23b, which functions as a support for rivets, so that they are not able to become displaced outside and thereby no longer lock together legs of the angled means 11 and the elements 19a, 19b. The invention is described in connection with boarding, either by means of boarding cassettes or boarding members, but it can be applied in the production of dismountable containers or boxes of many different types. Such an application can prove to be very interesting because of the great flexibility which the arrangement of the invention makes possible.
