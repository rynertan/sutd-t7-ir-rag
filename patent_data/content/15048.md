# Olefine polymerization catalyst and use thereof.

## Abstract
A component of a polymerisation catalyst is prepared by reacting an organo magnesium compound, or a complex with an organo aluminium compound, with an halogenating agent such as silicon tetrachloride or hydrogen chloride, and then reacting the product with a Lewis Base compound, par ticularly an ester and finally with titanium tetrachloride. The product obtained is combined with an organo aluminium compound preferably together with a Lewis Base and used to polymerise an olefine monomer particularly propylene. The catalyst system has a high activity and is stereospecific.
