## Description
Device slidably arranged d on on a guide rod with means for securing the device thereon.The invention relates to a device which is slidably arranged on at least one guide rod and which is provided with means for securing the device in an arbitrary position on the guide rod. Such a device can constitute a part of a box closing machine wherein the flaps of cartons are folded down into place on the top of the carton and thereafter fixed into sealed relationship thereto by means of adhesive tape for example. In order to make such a machine suitable for use with cartons having different dimensions the device which for example serves to effect lateral guidance of the cartons, must be easily adjustable. To this end the device can be arranged on, for example, a guide rod lying transverse to the direction of movement of the cartons. The device can be secured onto the guide rod with the aid of a clamping screw which may possibly be provided with a handle to enable rapid jtightening up of the screw to be effected.In order to counter the possibility of the device being shifted along the guide rod, the clamping screw would generally require to ,be screwed up tight thereon through which the danger exists that the guide rod shall be damaged. Hurtbez the possibility exists that a less strong person cannot loose the clamping screw easily.Furthermore, it is often desired that the guiding device for the cartons be resilient enough to give somewhat to allow passing of a carton with too large a dimension whilst all other cartons, conforming to normal dimensions, would only just engage the device in their passage through the machine. In order to make provision for such give, the device must be divided into two parts and one of which, remote from the cartons to be passed, is secured to the guide rod and the other of which is resiliently connected to the first mentioned part. Such an arrangement however, is a complicated and costly construction.The invention is directed to the provision of a device of simple construction in which the foregoingly quoted objec tionable characteristics are eliminated.According to the invention therefore, the device is charac terized in that the means for securing the device in an arbitrary position on the guide rod comprises a lever suppor ted on the device, a compression spring being arranged between the lever and an other part of the device remote therefrom, said lever being pivotably movable against the force exerted thereon by the compression spring to a position iin which it is substantially free from engagement with the guide rod and under the action of the compression spring will be urged to a position at which a part thereof engages the guide rod such that the lever is blocked from movement with respect thereto, said device being somewhat displacable with respect to the guide rod against the action of the compression spring when the lever is in a fixed position and when a force exceeding a preset value of the compression spring is applied to the device in the direction of the guide rod. In the device according to the invention, the lever need only be pivotable somewhat with respect to the other part of the device whilst the compression spring, by which means the lever is blocked from movement, is used simultaneously to make it possible for the device to be somewhat resilientv displaced with respect to the lever which remains stationary with respect to the guide rod, so that the device always attempts to return back to a certain position. The compression spring acts in such a manner that the lever always acts upon the guide rod with the same force which is chosen such that theeis little chance, or no chance at all, of the guide rod becoming damaged. n accordance with a further elaboration of the invention the guide rod engaging part of the lever is shaped such that the device can still be displaced on the guide rod with the lever in the blocked condition in that direction in which the device is urged by the compressioh spring acting upon the lever.By means of this it is possible to make a very accurate adjustment of the position of the device since a possibly needed final adjustment of the device can be made by giving it a tap. There is then no need to pivot the lever with respect to the device to free it from engagement with the guide rod and thereafter to re engage it, which handling might easily allow a slight displacement of the device with respect to the final desired position.According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the lever is in a position substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the guide rod and is provided with an aperture through which the guide rod may extend with ample play therebetween, in wliich the lever i urge by the compression spring toward a pin fixed to the device and arranges between the compression spring and the gui od perpendicu lax to the plane in which the lever and the compression spring lie, the pin being arranged to cooperate with a recess formed in one side of the lever, the deepest part of which recess is adapted to the shape of the pin and arranged to lie nearest the guide rod, said recess tapering from this part away from said guide rod toward that side of the lever in which it is included, said lever being coupled to the further part of the device only by the compression spring.This construction is thus pcrticularly simple in view of the fact that the lever, substantially forming the only moving part of the device, only engages the pin with its recess such that no hinge points are present.The invention is now to be described with reference to the accompanying drawings showing an embodiment, in which fig. 1 shows a side elevation of the device according to the present invention as adapted for use with a box closing machine, and in which only some of the parts are illustrated however,the other parts as such are not of importance to the invention, fig. 2 shows a cross sectional view of the device on line II II of fig. 1, and wherein only the most important of the parts are illustrated in the interests of clarity. iThe device illustrated in the drawings comprises two slide plates 1 and a top plate 2 which could, for example, be formed from one piece of sheet material by bending. Shafts 3 are accomodated between the side plates 1 and end portions 4 of which shafts 3 are worked to a smaller diameter and accomodated in holes 5 in the side plates 1. Rollers 6 are mounted on respective shafts 3, the shape of said rollers being adapted to the cross sectional form of the guide rod 4. The rollers 6 can be retained on the shafts, 3 3 by circlips 8 for example. IA pin 9, which can be of the same design as the shafts 3, is also accomodated between the side plates 1.The pin 9 is arranged in operative relationship with a lever 10 by means of a recess 11 in the latter, which lever is also provided with an aperture 12 therethrough, which aper inure 12 can pass the guide rod 7 therethrough with ample play therebetween. A spring accomodating boss 14 is affixed to the lever 10 by means of a screw 13, and over which one end of a compression spring 15 is fitted. The other end of the compression spring 15 is affixed to a second spring accomodating boss 16 which is in turn arranged on the support 17 affixed to the top plate 2 of the device. The top plate 2 is further provided with a slot 18 to permit passage of the lever 10 therealong. A bent plate 20 is fitted to the top plate 2 by means of screws 21, and further fixed to a second top plate 22 by screws 21. At least one guide roller 23 is arranged between the plates 20 and 22. The guide roller 23 is supported by a shaft not shown and retained by a washer 24 and a screw 25 thereabove. It will be self evident that the shaft not shown is fixed at its lower end to the plate 20.As previously implied herein, the guide roller 23 can jconstitute part of a box closing machine for example ,however the device can naturally be adapted for use with many machines in which it is of importance that the device be quickly secured to a guide rod therefor and can still resiliently give somewhat. When the device occupies the position shown in fig. 1 the lever 10 is blocked from movement with respect to the guide rod 7 through the engagement of the edges of the aperture 12 thereof with the guide rod 7. When a leftwardly directed force as viewed in fig. 1 is applied to the device and particularly to the guide rollers 23, the lever 10 will be maintained in its position relative to the guide rod 7. The spring 15, however, will be compressed somewhat and whereby the device as a whole, will be moved leftward somewhat. After removal of the displacing force the device will move back to the position shown in fig. 1. Vlith movement of the device leftward, the pin 9 will be positioned such that it lies further away from the lever 10, but this has no influence at all on the position of the latter with respect to the guide rod 7.It only means that the lever 10 engages the guide rod 7 even more firmly because the force exerted thereon by the compression spring 15 will increase. When it becomes necessary to secure the device in another ,position on the guide rod 7, one only needs tq grasp both the lever 10 and the support 17 and squeeze them and by doing so oversoming the force exerted on the river by the compression spring 15. This last action will bring the deepest part of the recess 11 into engagement with the pin 9, and whereupon the edges of aperture 12 in the lever 10 will be released from engagement with the guide rod 7 and free space will exist therebetween. The device can then be easily repositioned where required on the guide rod 7, and after which the grip on the lever 10 and support 17 can be .released.On effecting this release the device assumes the condition shown in fig. 1 whereby it is again secured on the guide rod 7. When the lower edge of the lever 10, as shown in fig. 1, is slightly radiused its grip on the guide rod 7 will be less. The device as a whole can then be moved rightward without the necessity to operate lever 10 with respect thereto.The left upper edge of the opening 12 will slide over the surface of the guide rod 7 so that the device remains blocked with respect to any force being exerted on the device in the leftward direction.As already stated herein, the drawings only illustrate those parts of the device which are of importance to the invention, other parts being necessary, however, to ensure that the device cannot turn about the axis of the guide rod 7. To this end for example, members can be provided to extend from one of the side plates 1 and which are provided with a sliding support at their ends remote from the side plate. Such arrangements, however, will be obvious to an expert.
