# Lithium thionyl chloride cell.

## Abstract
The anode of the lithium thionyl chloride cell according to the invention comprising a lithium substrate coated with a thin film of an aluminum alloy on the anode surface exposed to the electrolyte. Said aluminum alloy on the lithium anode causes a reduction in voltage delay in such cells.
