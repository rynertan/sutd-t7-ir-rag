## Description
The present invention relates to human urokinase polypeptide, to novel forms and compositions thereof and particularly to means and methods for the preparation The present invention is based in part on the discovery of the DNA sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of native urokinase as well as associated portions of the urokinase molecule found to be the functional bioactive moieties. This discovery enabled the production of urokinase polypeptide in various forms via the application of recombinant DNA technology, in turn enabling the production of sufficient quality and quantity of materials with which to conduct requisite biological testing identifying the biologically functional, hence useful moieties of the molecule. Having determined such, it was possible to tailor make functional species of urokinase polypeptide via genetic manipulation and The publications and other materials hereof used to illuminate the background of the invention, and in particular cases, to provide additional details concerning its practice are incorporated herein by reference, and for convenience, are numerically referenced in the following text and respectively grouped in the appended bibliography. The fibrinolytic system is in a dynamic equilibrium with the coagulation system, maintaining an intact, patent vascular bed. The coagulation system deposits fibrin as a matrix serving to restore a hemostatic condition. The fibrinolytic system removes the fibrin network after the hemostatic condition is achieved. The fibrinolytic process is brought about by the proteolytic enzyme plasmin that is generated from a plasma protein precursor plasminogen. Plasminogen is converted to plasmin through activation by an activator. Urokinase is one such activator. It and another activator, streptokinase, are currently commercially available. Both are indicated for the treatment of acute vascular diseases such as myocardial infarct, stroke, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, peripheral arterial occlusion and other venous thromboses. Collectively, these diseases account for major health hazards and risks. The underlying etiological basis for these diseases points to either a partial, or in severe cases, total occlusion of a blood vessel by a blood clot thrombus or thromboembolus. Traditional anticoagulant therapy, as with heparin and coumarin, does nothing to directly enhance dissolution of thrombi or thromboemboli. Streptokinase and urokinase have enjoyed practical and effective use as thrombolytic agents. Until now, however, each has suffered from severe limitations. Neither has demonstrated a high affinity for fibrin consequently, both activate circulating and fibrin bound plasminogen relatively indiscriminately. The plasmin formed in circulating blood is neutralized rather quickly and lost for useful thrombolysis. Residual plasmin will degrade several clotting factor proteins, for example, fibrinogen, Factor V and Factor VIII, causing a hemorrhagic potential. In addition, streptokinase is strongly antigenic and patients with high antibody titers respond inefficiently to treatment and cannot remain on continuous treatment. Urokinase therapy is expensive, owing to its involved isolation from human urine or tissue culture, and it therefore is not generally accepted in clinical practice. Urokinase has been the subject of numerous investigations See, for example, references 1 9. Presently available urokinase, as defined, is isolated from human urine or tissue culture, e.g. kidney cells 9A,9B . The urokinase molecule exists in several biologically active forms high molecular weight ca. 54000 daltons and low molecular weight ca. 33000 daltons , each composed of single chain or two chain material. The low molecular weight form is derived from the high molecular weight form by enzymatic cleavage. Biologically active material contains the so called serine protease portion linked, in active form, to a second chain via a disulfide bond. Any activity ascribed to the high molecular weight material is believed to be due to the similar presence of these two connected chains, the strategic disulfide bond and interruption in the sequence doubtless being located in the serine protease portion of the overall molecules See Figure A . In any event, until the present invention, the identity, and hence function, of the ca. 21000 dalton residue was unknown and the assignment of activity to one or another of the known moieties of urokinase was not uncontrovertedly possible. Recently, there was a report of another form of urokinase peptide having low, but specific activity 10, 10A . It was speculated that this material corresponds to native urokinase, a preform of the previously isolated active species described above, most probably consisting of a single chain. Previous attempts to clone the requisite gene for urokinase with attendant hopes of attaining expression in a microbial host were not believed successful 11, 11A . See also 6 . It was perceived that the application of recombinant DNA and associated technologies, after all, would be a most effective way of providing the requisite large quantities of high quality, bioactive human urokinase polypeptide essentially free of other human protein, and derivatives thereof that retain functional bioactivity, thus admitting of the use of such materials clinically in the treatment of various vascular conditions or diseases. Recombinant DNA technology has reached the age of some sophistication. Molecular biologists are able to recombine various DNA sequences with some facility, creating new DNA entities capable of producing copious amounts of exogenous protein product in transformed microbes and cell cultures. The general means and methods are in hand for the DNA recombination of the essential elements, i.e., an origin of replication, one or more phenotypic selection characteristics, an expression promoter, heterologous gene insert and remainder vector, generally is performed outside the host cell. The resulting recombinant replicable expression vehicle, or plasmid, is introduced into cells by transformation and large quantities of the recombinant vehicle obtained by growing the transformant. Where the gene is properly inserted with reference to portions which govern the transcription and translation of the encoded DNA message, the resulting expression vehicle is useful to actually produce the polypeptide sequence for which the inserted gene codes, a process referred to as expression. The resulting product may be obtained by lysing, if necessary, the host cell, in microbial systems, and recovering the product by appropriate purification from other proteins. In practice, the use of recombinant DNA technology can express entirely heterologous polypeptides so called direct expression or alternatively may express a heterologous polypeptide fused to a portion of the amino acid sequence of a homologous polypeptide. In the latter cases, the intended bioactive product is sometimes rendered bioinactive within the fused, homologous heterologous polypeptide until it is cleaved in an extracellular environment. See references 12 and 13 . Similarly, the art of cell or tissue cultures for studying genetics and cell physiology is well established. Means and methods are in hand for maintaining permanent cell lines, prepared by successive serial transfers from isolate normal cells. For use in research, such cell lines are maintained on a solid support in liquid medium, or by growth in suspension containing support nutriments. Scale up for large preparations seems to pose only mechanical problems. For further background, attention is directed to references 14 and 15 . Likewise, protein biochemistry is a useful, indeed necessary, adjunct in biotechnology. Cells producing the desired protein also produce hundreds of other proteins, endogenous products of the cell s metabolism. These contaminating proteins, as well as other compounds, if not removed from the desired protein, would prove toxic if administered to an animal or human in the course of therapeutic treatment with desired protein. Hence, the techniques of protein biochemistry come to bear, allowing the design of separation procedures suitable for the particular system under consideration and providing a homogeneous product safe for intended use. Protein biochemistry also proves the identity of the desired product characterizing it and ensuring that the cells have produced it faithfully with no alterations or mutations. This branch of science is also involved in the design of bioassays, stability studies and other procedures necessary to apply before successful clinical studies and marketing can take place. The present invention is based upon the discovery that recombinant DNA protein biochemistry technology can be used to successfully produce human urokinase in the form of biologically functional, tailored species. This invention provides active urokinase protein suitable for use in the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of human beings for various vascular conditions or diseases. Each of its forms includes the bioactive moiety, that is the enzymatic portion of native material believed to reside in the serine protease portion. In accordance with this invention, a series of urokinase active products can be prepared in a form available for The present invention provides an unglycosylated polypeptide having an intact lysine isoleucine bond at the position corresponding to amino acids 158 159 in the native prourokinase molecule, and having sufficient of the amino acid sequence set out in Figures 4A and 4B such that, on activation, the activated polypeptide exhibits the enzymatic activity of human urokinase. The polypeptide of the invention can be, for example, an unglycosylated prourokinase protein or Met prourokinase protein. It is preferred that the polypeptide has the sequence Lys Ile Ile Gly Gly, at positions corresponding to amino acids 158 162 in the native prourokinase molecule and, more particularly, that it has the amino acid sequence or substantially the amino acid sequence as depicted in Figures 4A and 4B. The present invention includes an isolated DNA sequence encoding the polypeptide of the invention, which sequence will normally be linked with a second DNA sequence capable of effecting expression of the first, and is further directed to replicable DNA expression vehicles harboring gene sequences encoding the polypeptide of the invention in expressible form. Further, the present invention is directed to a microorganism, e.g. In still further aspects, the invention includes a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the polypeptide of the invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and further includes the polypeptide of the invention for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body for the treatment of vascular diseases. Still further, this invention provides a process for producing a polypeptide by expressing a DNA sequence of the invention to form an unglycosylated polypeptide that, on activation, e.g. by proteolytic cleavage, is converted to a polypeptide that exhibits the enzymatic activity of human urokinase. Reference herein to the expression human urokinase polypeptide connotes polypeptide in bioactive form, produced by microbial culture or optional The work described herein was performed employing, As examples, the beta lactamase and lactose promoter systems have been advantageously used to initiate and sustain microbial production of heterologous polypeptides. Details relating to the make up and construction of these promoter systems can be had by reference to 18 and 19 . More recently, a system based upon the tryptophan pathway, the so called trp promoter system, has been developed. Details relating to the make up and construction of this system can be had by reference to 20 and 21 . Numerous other microbial promoters have been discovered and utilized and details concerning their nucleotide sequences enabling a skilled worker to ligate them functionally within plasmid vectors, have been published. See 22 . Expression plasmids for bacterial use, e.g., Figure A is a schematic diagram of urokinase polypeptides. Low molecular weight urokinase begins at amino acid 136 and ends at amino acid 411. High molecular weight urokinase starts at amino acid 1 and terminates at amino acid 411. Conversion of the one chain form of both high and low molecular weight urokinase to the bioactive two chain form occurs by proteolytic cleavage between amino acid 158 and 159. Pre urokinase begins at amino acid 20. The depicted conformational positioning of the disulfide bonds is based on analogy with other serine proteases.

Detroit 562 human pharangeal carcinoma cells 38 ATCC No. CCL 138 were cultured to confluency in Eagle s minimal essential medium 39 supplemented to contain 3 percent sodium bicarbonate pH 7.5 , 1 percent L glutamine Irvine , 10 percent fetal bovine serum, 1 percent sodium pyruvate Irvine , 1 percent non essential amino acids Irvine , 2.4 percent HEPES pH 7.5 , 50 µg ml Garamycin, and incubated at 37 C in a 5 percent CO₂ atmosphere. Confluent cells were harvested by centrifugation after treatment with 0.25 percent trypsin for 15 minutes at 37 C. Total RNA from Detroit 562 cells was extracted essentially as reported by Lynch Size fractionation of 200 µg polyA mRNA was achieved by electrophoresis through an acid urea gel composed of 1.75 percent agarose, 25 mM sodium citrate pH 3.8 and 6 M urea 40,42 . Electrophoresis was performed for 7 hours at 25 mA and 4 C. The gel was then fractionated manually with a razor blade. Individual slices of the gel were melted at 70 C, diluted into 12 mls 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4 , 1.5 mM MgCl₂, 0.1 percent SDS and extracted twice with water saturated, redistilled phenol and once with chloroform. Fractions were then ethanol precipitated and subsequently translated Poly A mRNA was size fractionated on acid urea gels. mRNA fractions greater than 12S were pooled and used as template for oligo dT primed preparation of double stranded cDNA by standard procedures 44,45 . The cDNA was size fractionated on 6 percent polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 132 ng of ds cDNA greater than 350 basepairs in length was obtained by electroelution. A 30 ng portion of ds cDNA was extended with deoxy C residues using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase 46 and annealed with 200 ng of the plasmid pBR322 37 which had been similarly tailed with deoxy G residues at Eight synthetic DNA oligomers 14 bases long were designed complementary to mRNA based on the Met Tyr Asn Asp Pro amino acid sequence of a urokinase cyanogen bromide polypeptide fragment designated CB6. These eight deoxyoligonucleotides were synthesized by the phosphotriester method 47 in the following pools of two CB6A 5 GGGTCGTTA GTACAT 3 , CB6B 5 GGATCGTTA GTACAT 3 , CB6C 5 GGGTCATTA GTACAT 3 , CB6D 5 GGATCATTA GTACAT 3 . Each pool of two oligomers was then radioactively phosphorylated as follows 250 ng of deoxyoligonucleotide were combined in 25 µl of 60 mM Tris HCl pH 8 , 10 mM MgCl₂, 15 mM beta mercaptoethanol, and 100 µCi γ ³²P ATP Amersham, 5000 Ci mMole . 5 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase were added and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 C for 30 minutes and terminated by addition of EDTA to 20 mM. 10000 colonies were individually inoculated into wells of microtitre dishes containing LB 48 5 µg ml tetracycline and stored at 20 C after addition of DMSO to 7 percent. Individual colonies from this library were transferred to Schleicher and Schuell BA85 20 nitrocellulose filters and grown on agar plates containing LB 5 µg ml tetracycline. After 10 hours growth at 37 C the colony filters were transferred to agar plates containing LB 5 µg ml tetracycline and 12.5 µg ml chloramphenicol and reincubated overnight at 37 C. The DNA from each colony was then denatured and fixed to the filter by a modification of the Grunstein Hogness procedure 49 . Each filter was floated for 3 minutes on 0.5 N NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl to lyse the colonies and denature the DNA then neutralized by floating for 15 on 3 M NaCl, 0.5 M Tris HCl pH 7.5 . The filters were then floated for an additional 15 minutes on 2XSSC, and subsequently baked for 2 hours in an 80 C vacuum oven. The filters were prehybridized for 2 hours at room temperature in 0.9 M NaCl, 1X Denhardts, 100 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 , 5 mM Na EDTA, 1 mM ATP, 1 M sodium phosphate dibasic , 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 percent NP 40, and 200 µg ml Plasmid DNA isolated from The first specifically primed cDNA bank utilized a 45 basepair urokinase DNA restriction endonuclease fragment beginning with A second specifically primed cDNA bank called UK89CB6 of about 4000 colonies was constructed using a pool of 4 µg polyA mRNA acid urea agarose gel fraction 8 and 4 µg polyA mRNA from fraction 9 Section C . 250 ng of each CB6 deoxyoligo nucleotide pool Section E were used as primer rather than oligo dT₁₂ ₁₈. Full length cDNA containing colonies were transferred directly to nitrocellulose filters then grown at 37 C. The colonies were lysed and the DNA was denatured and fixed to the filters as described in Section F 49 . A ³²P labelled DNA probe was prepared 54 from a 143 basepair DNA from 1900 UK89CB6 cDNA insert containing colonies was denatured and fixed to nitrocellulose filters as previously described in Section F. A ³²P labelled DNA probe was prepared 54 from the 146 bp pF1, having a cDNA insert fragment longer than that of pH10, was selected for sequencing. Both The amino terminal serine at amino acid position one as determined by amino acid sequence analysis is shown in Figures A and 4. The preceding 20 amino acids at the amino terminus beginning with met and ending with gly probably serves as a signal sequence for the secretion of the remaining 411 amino acids of high molecular weight urokinase. This putative signal sequence has features, such as size and hydrophobicity 56,57 , in common with other characterized signal sequences. Trypsin cleavage sites rendering 33K two chain low molecular weight urokinase from high molecular weight urokinase are as follows lys at position 136 is the amino terminal amino acid of the short chain and ile at position 159 is the amino terminus of the long chain Figures A, 4 . A plasmid pNCV, 58 was constructed which has the following properties 1 the plasmid is a derivative of pBR322 and is present in about 20 copies per cell. 2 the plasmid makes its The DNA fragment containing the trp promoter and LE gene was then introduced into plasmid pBR322 to give plasmid pNCV 47A . The urokinase With reference to Figure 5, 5 µg of plasmid pUK513dT69D2 pD2 was digested with 20 units Plasmid pINCV was constructed. It is similar to pNCV see A urokinase DNA fragment beginning with nucleotide 16 Figure 1 , was cloned into a pBR322 derivative resulting in a construction in which the trp promoter is positioned directly in front of this urokinase fragment encoding low molecular weight urokinase polypeptide. The plasmid pLeIFAtrp103 Figure 7 is a derivative of the plasmid pLeIFA25 58 in which the The plasmid PUK33trpLE A 14 nucleotide DNA primer encoding the amino acid sequence met lys lys pro was synthesized by the phosphotriester method 47 and has the following sequence 500 ng of this primer were phosphorylated at the 5 end with 10 units T4 DNA Kinase in a 20 µl reaction containing 0.5 mM ATP. The 264 bp We found it desirable to construct a derivative plasmid of pUK33trp103 that would confer tetracycline resistance to its host cell. Figure 8 depicts the following construction of pUK33trp103Ap 5µg pBR322 DNA was digested with EcoR1 and the cohesive ends were filled in with Klenow Pol1. After Pst1 digestion, the large vector fragment containing the DNA that encodes tetracycline resistance, the origin of replication, and a portion of the ampicillln resistance gene was isolated and purified. 5µg of pUK33trp103 Ap Figure 10 illustrates construct for full length urokinase polypeptide. Plasmid pHGH207 1, having a single trp promoter, was obtained by removal of the double lac promoter from pHGH 207 that has a double lac promoter followed by a single trp promoter. This was done as follows The trp promoter 310bp DNA fragment was obtained from pFIF trp 69 20 by digestion with EcoRI. This fragment was inserted into pHGH 107 44 that had been opened with EcoRI. Thus, a plasmid was obtained pHGH 207 that has a double lac promoter followed by the trp promoter, flanked by EcoRI sites. The thus obtained pHGH 207 was digested with BamHI this was partially digested with EcoRI and the largest fragment was isolated. This fragment therefore has the entire trp promoter. From pBR322 the largest EcoRI BamHI fragment was isolated. Both fragments were ligated and the mixture was used to transform 20 µg of pHGH207 1 was partially digested with As indicated, the amino acid sequence Met Ser Asn Glu Leu His Gln Val Pro encodes the initiation codon, ATG, and the eight amino terminal amino acids of high molecular weight urokinase. 50 ng of each synthetic DNA fragment were phosphorylated and the fragments were mixed, heated to 65 C for 1 minute and allowed to cool at room temperature for 5 minutes. 10 ng of the phosphorylated and mixed synthetic DNA fragments were combined with 200 ng of the partial 4 µg of pNCV Section M was digested with 5µg of pUK33trp103Ap 5 µg of pInt3 DNA was digested with The following scheme was used to construct a plasmid for direct expression of preUK54. Two complementary DNA fragments were synthesized by the phosphotriester method 47 encoding the amino acid sequence initiation codon ATG followed by the first three N terminal amino acids of the urokinase presequence Arg Ala Leu as shown below EcoR1 and Bgl1 restriction endonuclease cleavage sites flank this portion of the presequence. 50ng of each synthetic DNA fragment was phosphorylated. The phosphorylated fragments were mixed, heated to 65 C for 1 minute and allowed to cool to room temperature. 5µg of pF1 DNA was digested with Bgl1 and Bgl2 and the 310bp UK DNA fragment was isolated and purified. 50ng of the 310bp UK DNA fragment, 150ng of the partial EcoR1, BglII vector DNA fragment from pHGH207 1 see Section N and 10ng of the phosphorylated and mixed synthetic DNA fragments was ligated overnight at 14 C and transformed into One correct plasmid was named pInt4. 5µg of pInt4 DNA was digested with BglII and EcoRv for isolation and purificaton of the vector DNA fragment containing the N terminal nucleotides of pre UK54, the trp promoter, ampicillin resistance genes, origin of replication and a portion of the tetracycline resistance encoding DNA. 5µg of pUK54trp207 1 DNA was digested with BglII and EcoRv. The BglIIEcoRv DNA fragment encoding the remainder of UK54 and the tetracycline resistance encoding DNA was isolated, purified and ligated with the BglII EcoRv vector DNA fragment to complete the construction of the plasmid p preUK54trp207 1. Urokinase polypeptide containing residue was isolated from Upon purification following conventional techniques, the polypeptide is characterized showing the expected N terminal sequence for both chains of the low molecular weight, bioactive material. C terminal analysis also shows the proper sequence for both chains. The protein migrates at a molecular weight of 30,000 daltons. It has a specific activity of 170,000 PU mg 9225,000 IU mg , assuming 1 mg ml has an OD₂₈₀ of 1.3. The assay is based on the proteolytic cleavage of a tripeptide from a chromophoric group. The rate of cleavage can be directly related to the specificity and to the concentration of the protease being tested. Urokinase cleaves the chromogenic substrate S2444 purchased from Kabi Group Inc., Greenwich, CT . By monitoring the generation of the chromophore, one can determine the amount of functional urokinase polypeptide present in a sample. Urokinase is synthesized as an inactive precurser form, with activation occurring via the cleavage between residue 26 lysine and 27 isoleucine numbering based on the protease clone, Figure 2A . Some preparations of urokinase polypeptide were found to have been autoactivated and or were activated by The assay is performed as follows 0.2mL of 0.1M Tris, pH 8.0, 50µL of the sample to be assayed, and 5µL of trypsin 0.1mg mL in 0.1M Tris, pH 8.0 plus 0.25M CaCl₂ were added to a test tube and the sample incubated for 10 minutes at 37 C. The trypsin was inactivated by the addition of 2µL of 10mg mL STI in 0.1M Tris, pH 8.0 . Urokinase activity was determined by adding 50µL of a 1mM solution of S2444 in water and incubating the reaction for 10 minutes at 37 C. Acetic acid 50µL was added to stop the reaction, the solution centrifuged to remove a precipitate, and the absorbance at 405nm was determined. The actual amount of urokinase polypeptide can be calculated by comparison of a sample with the reading obtained by performing the assay with dilutions of a standard solution of a known amount of urokinase obtained from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA . A much more sensitive assay for urokinase can be obtained by monitoring the urokinase catalyzed conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin is an enzyme for which there are chromogenic substrate assays based on the same principles as described in 1 above. The basis of the assay is the determination of the amount of plasmin formed following incubation of the urokinase containing solution with a solution of plasminogen. The greater the amount of urokinase, the greater the amount of plasmin formed. An aliquot of the sample is mixed with 0.10 ml of 0.7 mgs ml plasminogen in 0.5M Tris HCl, pH 7.4, containing .012 M NaCl and the volume adjusted to 0.15 ml. The mixture is incubated at 37 C for various times as indicated , 0.35 ml of S2251 1.0 mM solution in above buffer is added and the reaction continued for 5 minutes at 37 C. Acetic acid 25 µL is added to terminate the reaction and absorbance at 405 nm is measured. Quantitation of the amount of activity is obtained by comparison with dilutions of a standard urokinase solution. A sensitive assay for urokinase activity has been developed 61 . The assay is based on determination of plasmin formation by measuring the extent of plasmin digestion of fibrin in an agar plate containing fibrin and plasminogen. Plasmin produces a clear lysis zone in the fibrin plate. The area of this lysis zone can be correlated to the amount of urokinase in the sample. Following the procedure of Granelli Piperno and Reich 61 , the plates were incubated one to three hours at 37 C and lysis zones measured. Quantitation was obtained by performing the assay with dilutions of a standard urokinase solution. A strain of The sample was applied to a 3.9 x 9 cm DE 52 column, which had been equilibrated with 0.01 M Tris HCl, pH 7.5, and the column washed with the same buffer and eluted with 0.01 M Tris HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl. The peak of activity was pooled and used for all further studies. Figure 11 shows the results of the direct activation of plasminogen by fractionated The extracts also were tested in the assays as described above in order to detect and quantitate urokinase activity. Figure 12 shows the effect of various amounts of the bacterially derived fractions in the assay described in Section Q.2 with a 10 minute activation. The values obtained are compared to those obtained using a standard urokinase solution Plough Unitage determination . The extent of plasminogen activation is directly proportional to the amount of added cloned urokinase. Antibodies raised against purified natural urokinase are known to decrease the activity of natural urokinase. The effect of these antibodies when added to this assay at time 0 are also shown in Figure 12. A marked inhibition of the Similar results for activity detection and antibody inhibition are observed using the fibrin plate assay described in Section Q.3 . These results are summarized in Table I. The standard urokinase activity was inhibited 96 percent or greater by the addition of urokinase antibodies raised against this protein. Assay of the The third assay the chromogenic substrate assay also detected a urokinase like activity in the The above three assays were quantitated using the standard urokinase purchased from Calbiochem. The values obtained Plough units per mL were all of the same order of magnitude 500 for fibrin plate 100 for plasminogen activation and 350 for the chromogenic substrate S2444 . Variations occuring are doubtless due to the relatively impure nature of the material at the time of testing. The compounds of the present invention can be formulated according to known methods to prepare pharmaceutically useful compositions, whereby the human urokinase polypeptide product hereof is combined in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier vehicle. Suitable vehicles and their formulation are described for example in Remington s The human urokinase polypeptide hereof may be parenterally administered to subjects suffering from thromboembolic diseases or conditions. Dosage and dose rate may parallel those currently in use in clinical applications of other cardiovascular, thrombolytic agents, e.g., about 4400 IU kg body weight as an intravenous priming dose followed by a continuous intravenous infusion at about 4400 IU kg hr. for 12 hours, in patients suffering from pulmonary embolism. As one example of an appropriate dosage form for essentially homogeneous human urokinase polypeptide in parenteral form applicable herein, a vial containing 250000 IU urokinase activity, 25 mg. mannitol and 45 mg. sodium chloride, may be reconstituted with 5 ml sterile water for injection and admixed with a suitable volume of 0.9 percent Sodium Chloride Injection or 5 percent Dextrose Injection for intravenous administration. The human urokinase polypeptide hereof has been defined by means of determined DNA gene and deductive amino acid sequencing. It will be understood that natural allelic variations exist and occur from individual to individual. These variations may be demonstrated by an amino acid difference s in the overall sequence or by deletions, substitutions, insertions, inversions or additions of an amino acid s in said sequence. In addition, the potential exists in the use of recombinant DNA technology for the preparation of various human urokinase polypeptide derivatives, variously modified by resultant single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions or replacements, for example, by means of site directed mutagenesis of the underlying DNA. All such modifications and allelic variations resulting in derivatives of human urokinase polypeptide are included within the ambit of this invention so long as the essential, characteristic human urokinase activity remains unaffected in kind. Notwithstanding that reference has been made to particular preferred embodiments, it will be further understood that the present invention is not to be construed as limited to such, rather to the lawful scope of the appended claims.
