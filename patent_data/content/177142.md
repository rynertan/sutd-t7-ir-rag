## Description
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for controlling motion of a tool centrepoint. From US A 4453221 which refers to US A 3909600 in respect of certain calculational details , there is known a method and apparatus for controlling motion of a tool centrepoint associated with a function element carried by a manipulator, for performing an operation on a workpiece, the manipulator having movable members driven by actuators controlled by servo mechanism circuits, the servo mechanism circuits being controlled by intermediate coordinate location signals produced in response to an incremental velocity signal which is iteratively produced in response to a programmed velocity and which represents the velocity of the tool centrepoint during an iteration interval, the intermediate coordinate location signals representing coordinates relative to a manipulator frame of reference of intermediate locations of the tool centrepoint along straight lines between successive programmed tool centrepoint locations, and the programmed locations and velocity being defined by input signals. Difficulties arise where a workpiece has surface segments which cannot simultaneously be presented in the most advantageous attitude. For example, where seam joining or sealing is involved, best results are achieved when gravity assists the deposition of material, and difficulties arise where the seam traverses a contour on a curved plane or across multiple flat planes. It is an object of the present invention to provide rotation of a workpiece in coordination with motion of the tool centrepoint, to enable continuous processing to be achieved over such surface segments, with suitable relative orientation of workpiece and tool, at a programmed relative velocity between the tool and the workpiece surface. The method and apparatus in accordance with the present invention are characterised in that There will now be given a detailed description, to be read with reference to the accompanying drawings, of an industrial manipulator, and of a method of controlling the manipulator relative to a workpiece, which have been selected for the purposes of illustrating this invention by way of example. In the accompanying drawings For the purpose of illustrating the present invention, a manipulator and control shown in the accompanying drawings shall be described in detail. This manipulator and control correspond to those manufactured by Cincinnati Milacron Industries Inc., the assignee of the present invention. While the detailed description of the preferred embodiment shall necessarily reflect the actual implementation, such details should not be construed as limitations on the present invention. Referring to Figure 1, a manipulator 10 is shown carrying a tool 50 and connected to a control 60. The manipulator is constructed so that the motion of its members describe axes of rotation. The first of these axes is called the base axis and is defined by rotation of the plate 16 about a vertical axis through its centre. An upper arm 18 rotates about a horizontal axis, called the shoulder axis, through the centre of pivot 20 intersecting the vertical axis of rotation of the base. A forearm 22 rotates about a horizontal axis called the elbow axis, through the pivot 24. Mounted at the end of forearm 22 is wrist 32 which provides three additional axes of rotation. The first of these is rotation of segment 33 about an axis lying parallel to or coincident with the longitudinal centreline of forearm 22 the second is rotation of segment 31 about an axis perpendicular to the slice separating the inner segment 33 from the outer segment 31 and, the third is rotation of face plate 44 about an axis orthogonal thereto and through its centre. Rotations of members about the base, shoulder, and elbow axes are sufficient to define locations within the operating volume of the manipulator of a tool centrepoint 48 associated with the tool 50. Rotations of the inner and outer segments of the wrist 32 and the face plate 44 control orientations of the tool at the programmed locations in accordance with programmed orientation angles. Each of the six axes of motion is servo controlled by connection of command and feedback signals to servo control 64 of the control 60. Operation of the tool 50 is accomplished by a machine interface 66 which responds to the programmed cycle of operation controlled by the cycle control 62. The cycle control 62 operates upon stored location, velocity, and function data to produce control signals for the servo control 64 and the machine interface 66. As shown, the tool 50 is a welding torch and control of the welding process is effected through the machine interface in response to stored function signals. Other tools for joining, cutting, cleaning, polishing, grasping, and so forth may be substituted for the torch shown and controlled through the machine interface 66. Rotations of the upper arm and forearm about their respective axes are achieved by the linear motions of the screws 30 and 25 through the nuts 28 and 26. Rotation of the nuts is imparted through pulleys 29 and 27 respectively by drive motors not shown. Rotation of plate 16 about its axis is accomplished through the transmission 15 driving the pinion 13 which in turn drives ring gear 17 mounted to plate 16. The drive to transmission 15 is provided by motor 14. Rotation of the axes of wrist 32 is accomplished through concentric torque tubes, not shown, within forearm 22 driven by the motors 34, 36 and 38 through transmission 40. Position signals for each movable member are produced by position transducers, such as resolvers, which may be mechanically driven by motion of the machine member or the drive motor of the machine member. Referring now to Figure 2, the block diagram of the control of Figure 1 shall be described. The control is implemented using a plurality of microprocessors communicating through a common bus. Applicants have chosen to use the commercially available 8085 and 8086 microprocessors produced by Intel Corporation. It will be recognised by those skilled in the art that any other suitable general purpose digital computer could be used to implement the control algorithms to be described hereinafter. Cycle control 62 includes microprocessor 72 and interrupt control 74 both tied directly to the system bus 80. Operating system programmes executed by microprocessor 72 are stored in memory 76 and include the programmes identified as mode control 82. auto mode 84 and teach mode 86. Data defining the user specified locations, velocities and functions are stored in data store 78. Memory 76 is connected directly to system bus 80. The set of programmes identified as auto mode 84 are used by microprocessor 72 to execute the cycle of operation defined by the data stored in data store 78. Execution of the auto mode programmes is carried out by microprocessor 72 independently until execution is interrupted by an interrupt signal processed by interrupt control 74. While a variety of interrupts may be necessitated by equipment associated with control 60, only a single interrupt signal, produced by the servo control, is of relevance to the present invention. Servo control 64 includes the servo supervisor 90 which preprocesses servo command signals produced by cycle control 62 and the servo input output modules 92, 94, and 96 associated with the actual control of the manipulator axis drive motors. Servo input output module 97 is associated with control of the workpiece positioner. The servo supervisor 90 includes a microprocessor 100, a programmable timer 102, and local memory 104 including the servo control process programmes 105. Servo interrupt signals are periodically produced by the programmable timer 102. The period between interrupt signals defines the interval of each iteration of the path control procedures executed by the cycle control. The servo supervisor 90 receives machine axes command signals representing increments of motion of the manipulator and positioner members relative to their axes of rotation to be effected during the iteration interval. These machine axis command signals are processed by the servo supervisor 90 to produce servo command signals defining sub increments for each of the machine axes effective for sub divisions of the iteration interval. The servo command signals are distributed to the servo input output modules 92, 94, 96 and 97 at predefined sub intervals of the iteration interval. The servo input output modules 92, 94, 96 and 97 use the servo command signals and feedback signals produced by position transducers to control the machine axes drive motors. The block diagram of the servo input output module 92 is representative of the interconnection of elements of the servo input output modules 94, 96 and 97. Data is transferred to and from the module from the system bus 80 through the dual port device 118. The module includes a local bus 116 interconnecting a microprocessor 106 with the dual port device 118, a local memory 112, the drive interface circuitry 110, and the machine axis position measuring transducer interface 108. The microprocessor 106 controls two machine axis drive motors, such as motors 124 and 126 in response to the servo command signals and the feedback signals according to the servo input output programme 114 stored in memory 112. Each machine axis servo command signal is compared to the corresponding current position signal as defined by the position transducer to produce a position error signal which is then applied to the drive interface circuitry 110 to produce a drive control signal for application to the associated machine axis drive motor. Keeping in mind that each servo 1 0 module controls two machine drive axes, the blocks 128, 130 and 131 are understood to each represent two pairs of resolvers and drive motors. Servo command signals represent increments of machine axis motion to be effected within a few milliseconds. By contrast the machine axis command signals represent increments of machine member motion to be effected within the iteration interval of 10 to 20 milliseconds. In addition to the generation of the machine axis command signals, cycle control 62 controls the execution of functions represented by input signals and associated with the tool 50 and a workpiece positioner to be performed at programmed locations. Function commands are stored with the programme data in data store 78 and are executed in accordance with function execution sub routines associated with the auto mode programmes 84. Control of machine functions is effected through input output devices, such as limit switches, push buttons, relays and solenoids. The machine input output devices are directly controlled by the device 1.0. module 132 in cooperation with the machine input output interface circuitry 150. Data is transferred to and from the system bus 80 through the dual port device 146. The dual port device 146 is connected to the local bus 144 of the device input output control module 132. Operation of the module is controlled by the local microprocessor 134 connected to bus 144 which executes programmes stored in the local memory 140. Connection of the machine input output interface circuitry 150 to module 132 is accomplished through a serial interface circuit 136. A control cabinet operator panel 148 is connected by parallel lines to a parallel interface circuit 138. Monitoring and control of the interface circuits 138 and 136 are accomplished by the microprocessor 134 in response to respectively the control 1.0. programme 141 and the machine 1.0. programme 142 stored in local memory 140. Current conditions of machine input output devices are reflected in device status signals transferred from the device 1.0. module through the dual port device 146 to the cycle control 62. Function command signals produced by cycle control 62 in accordance with the stored programme of operation are transferred over system bus 80 through dual port device 146 and ultimately to the appropriate machine input output interface device by the serial interface 136. In addition to signal exchange between machine device interfaces, the control permits exchange of data through the data input output module 152 and its associated interfaces. While the cycle control 62 is operating under the auto mode programmes 84, location data may be exchanged in response to function commands. This in process data exchange takes place between an in process data transceiver 174 and the control 60 through the data 1.0. module 152. Location data from data store 78 is transferred from system bus 80 to the data 1.0. module through its dual port device 166. The data 1.0. module microprocessor 154 operating under control of the in process transceiver 1.0. programme 162 stored in its local memory 158 transfers the location data from dual port device 166 to the serial channel interface 156 for transmission to the in process data transceiver 174. In reverse, data from the in process data transceiver 174 is input to the serial channel interface 156, and transferred therefrom on the local bus 164 to the dual port device 166. From there data is available to the cycle control 62 on the system bus 80. In addition to the in process data exchange just described, programme data may be exchanged between the data store 78 of memory 76 and a bulk data store through a bulk data transceiver 172 or to a data terminal 170. Examples of a bulk data store include serial tape and data disk devices. A data terminal 170 may be used to display and modify programme data for restorage after modification. In either event data is exchanged by the data 1.0. module microprocessor 154 operating in response to the appropriate programme set such as, for example, the data terminal 1.0. programme 160 or the bulk data transceiver 1.0. programme 161. Data is transferred to and from the external device through the serial data interface 156 to the local bus 164 and through the dual port device 166 connected to system bus 80. One final data input output device, the teach pendent 168 is associated with the execution of teach mode programmes 86 by the cycle control 62. Location and function data defining a programmed cycle of operation may be generated by an operator using the teach pendent 168. This pendent permits manual operation of manipulator 10 and the storage of location and function data in data store 78. As with the other data input output devices, data is transferred to and from pendent 168 through the serial channel interface 156 to local bus 164 and therefrom through the dual port device 166 to the system bus 80. As the teach mode of operation does not form a part of the present invention further details thereof shall not be given herein. Additional details of the operation of the robot in the teach mode may be found in U.S. Patent No. 3,920,972. The workpiece positioner is operated in the teach mode by means of auxillary motion buttons on the teach pendant. While motion of all workpiece positioner axes can be commanded in the teach mode the present invention provides for recording plural position data for the positioner axis which effects rotation of the table upon which the workpiece is mounted. As it is an object of the auto mode programme 84 to control the motion of the manipulator members to produce motion of the tool centrepoint along a straight line path between programmed locations, a schematic representation of the manipulator shall be useful in describing the auto mode control algorithms. Such a schematic representation is depicted in Figure 3 a . In Figure 3 a a series of line segments corresponding to the arm members of manipulator 10 are shown in relation to a rectangular coordinate system. The origin of this coordinate system corresponds to a point on the manipulator located at the intersection of the vertical axis of rotation of the base plate 16 and the horizontal axis of rotation through pivot 20. In this drawing, link 19 corresponds to upper arm 18, link 23 corresponds to forearm 22, link 45 corresponds to the span from the point of intersection of the three axes of rotation of wrist 32 to a point on the final axis of rotation roll axis the tool length distance from the face plate 44, link 47 corresponds to first tool offset along the Y axis of a hand coordinate system and link 49 corresponds to a second tool offset along the Z axis of the hand coordinate system. Additional description of the hand coordinate system shall be provided subsequently. The links of Figure 3 a are dimensioned respectively with lengths L₁, L₂, L₃, L₄ and L₅. The three axes of rotation of the base plate, upper arm, and forearm members are dimensioned by magnitudes of the angles A, B and C shown in Figure 3 a . It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art with reference to Figure 3 a that the lengths L₁ to L₅ and the magnitudes of the angles A, B, and C completely define the location of the tool centrepoint 48 provided that the three axes of rotation of wrist 32 are so arranged that link 45 is along the axis of link 23. The introduction of rotation at the axes of wrist 32 provides for orientation of a function element associated with tool 50 through the tool centrepoint 48. Consequently, each set of input signals, for a location includes input signals representing the rectangular coordinate values of the location of tool centrepoint 48 and the values of three orientation angles defining the orientation of the function element. The relationship of these orientation angles Euler angles to the wrist 32 shall be described with reference to Figures 3 b and 3 c . In Figure 3 b wrist 32 is shown to consist of an inner segment 33 by which the wrist is attached to manipulator 10 and an outer segment 31 upon which face plate 44 is carried. The first axis of rotation of wrist 32 is a rotation of segment 33 about the longitudinal axis corresponding to link 23 of Figure 3 a . The second axis of rotation of wrist 32 is rotation of outer segment 31 about an axis perpendicular to and through the centre of the slice separating the inner segment 33 from the outer segment 31. The third axis of rotation of wrist 32 is rotation of the face plate 44 about the axis perpendicular to the plane of the face plate and through the centre thereof. Tool 50 is mounted to face plate 44. Figure 3 c illustrates how the orientation angles are defined with respect to a second rectangular coordinate system having its origin at the tool centrepoint 48. The axes of this coordinate system X It will now be appreciated that the arm configuration is completely defined by the X, Y and Z coordinates of the tool centrepoint 48 and the orientation angles D, E, and R when the tool length and tool offset dimensions are known. Having now fully described the manipulator, and its control, the workpiece positioner shall be described with reference to Figure 3 d . A workpiece, not shown in this Figure, is mounted on table 408 of positioner 400. The workpiece positioner rectangular coordinate system has its origin at the centre of the surface of table 408 and is described as having its X As shown in Figure 3 d the workpiece positioner includes two axes of rotation for controlling tilt and swing of the positioner table. The swing angle is a rotation about the positioner Z axis. The tilt angle is a rotation about he rotated positioner Y axis. The combination of these rotations and the initial alignment of the positioner coordinate system axes relative to the manipulator coordinate system axes are defined by two sets of additional input signals. The relative locations and orientations of the positioner coordinate system and the manipulator coordinate system are shown in Figure 3 d . The first set of the additional input signals defines the rotations of the positioner coordinate system relative to the manipulator coordinate system. J represents the angle between the manipulator X axis X and a rotated orientation thereof which would make it parallel to the positioner X axis X While the positioner has been illustrated with plural axes of rotation, the present invention does not require any rotation other than rotation of the workpiece about a single axis. Tilt or swing may be achieved by set up or resettable alignment. Nevertheless, the angles of positioner coordinate system rotation relative to the manipulator coordinate system must be known for the coordinate transformation. Also shown in Figure 3 d is the envelope of velocity coordination associated with workpiece positioner 400. This envelope is shown by dashed lines extending in the positive X direction from table 408. A cylinder is described by a radial limit RD It is the object of control of the auto mode programmes 84 that motion between programmed locations of the tool centrepoint 48 be along a straight line path and that changes of orientation between programmed locations be accomplished by linearization of the orientation angle changes between the programmed locations. Motions may be executed which involve changes only of position or orientation as well as changes of both. In either event the control automatically determines the appropriate machine axis values to accomplish the change of position and or orientation at the programmed rate, while maintaining the tool centre point on the straight line path between programmed locations or at the programmed location of pure orientation moves. The coordination of linear motion of the tool centrepoint with rotation of the workpiece will in general result in the generation of a spiral path on the workpiece surface. Therefore, the effective path length includes components of both the linear motion of the tool centrepoint and the rotation of the workpiece. To coordinate the interpolated motion of the tool centrepoint and the workpiece rotation and in particular, to achieve the desired velocity coordination, it is necessary to determine the dominant component of motion. That is, it is necessary to determine whether the linear motion of the tool centrepoint, the arc distance of the workpiece rotation, or the effective arc distance of orientation about the tool centrepoint is the longest of the motion components. The longest motion component controls the interpolation process and any motion which has an effective length less than the controlling motion component is interpolated so that all motion components are completed simultaneously. The motion control of the tool centrepoint effected by the path control algorithm is illustrated in Figure 4 a . In this figure, programmed locations defined by input signals, are designated as P₀ and P₁. The straight line path connecting these programmed locations is represented by line segment 180. In automatic mode the control iteratively interpolates intermediate locations P Figure 4 b illustrates the velocity profile for a move without velocity coordination between programmed locations starting at an initial velocity V Figure 4 c shows the effects of velocity variations with velocity coordination in accordance with manipulator motion towards decreasing workpiece diameters. Again, the horizontal axis measures time and the vertical axis measures velocity. The velocity profile of Figure 4 c may be better understood with reference to the workpiece and combined motions illustrated in Figure 4 d . A workpiece 420 is rotated through an angle W while the tool centrepoint traverse a linear path S Figure 4 e illustrates relative motion of the tool centrepoint to the workpiece rotation wherein the resultant combination has a substantial tangential component. A tangential component is to be expected where the linear path taught does not lie precisely in the same plane as the axis of rotation of the workpiece positioner table. This condition may result from lack of precision in teaching the linear span start and ending locations or from following the eccentricity of the workpiece relative to the axis of rotation of the positioner. In general, the tangential component is expected fo be sufficiently small so that it can be ignored. However, applicants have recognised that situations may arise when the tangential component cannot be ignored. In this case, it is assumed that the spacing of programmed locations is such that a linear approximation of the actual relative motion between the tool centrepoint and workpiece surface is sufficiently accurate. Tool centrepoint motion begins at point P₀ and advances to point P₁. As it traverses a linear path therebetween the tool centrepoint encounters a changing radius from R₀ to R₁ of ΔR. The change of radius is calculated as the difference in the radial distances RD₀ and RD₁ at the locations P₀ and P₁. The length of the tangential deviation, that is, the length along a tangent to the radius at the end location P₁, is the length of the side of a right triangle having a hypoteneuse equal in length to the projection of path length in the plane of the positioner table and a side having a length equal to the change in radius. Thus, the tangential deviation is equal in length to the square root of the sum of the squares of the Y As was previously stated, the path control algorithm of the present invention involves execution of the auto mode programmes 84. The auto mode is concerned with two principal procedures, first to produce the axis command signals for each iteration and second to process the axis command signals for application to the axis drives. Figure 5 a is a flow chart of the overall procedure for producing the axis command signals. Figure 5 b is a flow chart of the procedure for processing the axis command signals and applying the resultant servo command signals to the axis drives. Referring to Figure 5 a at process step 300 span data variables used in the interpolation process are initialised. These include the programmed span length S Returning to decision step 306, had it been determined that the no declaration flag was not set then the execution of the procedure continues at process step 308 where the distance remaining to the beginning of the deceleration subspan is calculated. This calculation produces the remaining distance signal S Referring to decision step 312, had it been determined that the distance remaining S Referring again to decision step 316, if it had been determined that the programmed location for the end of the current span is one through which motion of the tool centrepoint is to continue, execution of the overall cycle control procedure advances to process step 318 where the distance to a continue point end of span is calculated. The continue point end of span distance is found by first calculating the integral number of interations 1 equal to the present incremental distance ΔS remaining in the current span length. Second, a new end point S The determination of the value of the included angle relies upon the rule of cosines. Two values for the span distance between the programmed location at the beginning of the present span and the programmed location at the completion of the next span are produced independently. That is the span length S² If it is determined at decision step 320 that the included angle is not less than 120 Referring to Figure 5 b the servo interupt service routine executed by servocontrol 90 begins at decision step 340 where it is determined whether or not the buffer in which axis command signals are temporarily stored is empty. If the buffer is empty it is assumed that the cycle control has reached the end of span and an end of span signal is set at process step 344. If the buffer is found not to be empty by decision step 340 then the axis motion increments represented by the axis command signals are retrieved from the buffer at step 342. At terminal 348 the servo interupt routine is ended and execution of the overall cycle of operation by the cycle control 62 resumes. As was previously stated the servo supervisor 90 divides the increments represented by the axis command signals into subincrements and distributes the subincrements to the servo I.O. modules. The process of division and distribution of the servo command signals continues concurrently with the execution of the overall automatic mode procedure by the cycle control 70. The description of major segments and subroutines associated with the flow chart of Figure 5 a shall be described with reference to Figures 6 a through 6 f . Figure 6 a is an expansion of the steps associated with process block 300 of Figure 5 a . The span data initialisation procedure begins at process step 200 where data are recalled from the data store 78. The recalled data includes the coordinate data for the present and next programmed locations given as P Referring again to Figure 5 a it is seen that following initialisation of the span data, the control procedure continues with interpolation of a span increment as indicated by process block 302. Figure 6 b is an expansion of the process steps associated with process step 302. Referring to Figure 6 b , at process step 214 the interpolation iteration counter is incremented. At decision step 212 it is determined whether the current incremental velocity represented by the incremental velocity signal V If at decision step 212 it is determined that the increment velocity is not less than the programmed velocity then process execution continues at process step 210 where the incremental velocity is set equal to the adjusted programmed velocity. Execution then proceeds to process steps 213 and 215 to compute a new incremental velocity value as required. Thereafter, execution continues at process step 218 where an incremental distance ΔS is computed and thence to process step 220 where the accumulated distance is computed using the calculated value of the incremental distance ΔS. As before, upon completion of the calculation associated with process step 220, execution of the overall control procedure is resumed through the continue of terminal 221. Upon completion of the execution of the process steps associated with process block 302 of Figure 5 a execution of the overall control procedure continues with the initiation of execution of the transformation procedure by the subroutine call at process step 304 at Figure 5 a . This procedure transforms rectangular coordinates and angular coordinates of the interpolated intermediate location, orientation and rotation to coordinates for the movable machine members. Figure 6 c is a flow chart of the transformation subroutine called by process step 304 of Figure 5 a . At process step 222 of Figure 6 c values for the rectangular coordinates relative to the manipulator, the orientation angles and the workpiece positioner rotation are computed for the current iterative increment of motion along the path. Each coordinate value is represented by an intermediate location coordinate signal and equals the sum of the corresponding value calculated for the immediately preceding iteration and the product of a coordinate component ratio and the incremental distanceΔS. Thus, intermediate locations, orientation and workpiece positioner angular coordinates are all produced. Following the calculation at process step 224 the set of coordinate values are transformed to values of the machine coordinate system, that is, values for the axes of motion of the movable machine members. Because the manipulator axes are axes of rotation the transformation process requires solution of inverse trigonometric relationships. Details of the transformation process are set forth in U.S. Patent No. 3,909,600, which, to the extent required to describe the transformation to machine coordinates, is incorporated herein by reference. Upon completion of the transformation to machine coordinates the incremental change of machine coordinates is computed at process step 226. At process step 228 the incremental change of machine coordinates represented by machine axis command signals are stored in a temporary buffer. Thereafter, execution of the overall control procedure is resumed by a return through terminal 230. Referring again to Figure 5 a . following the execution of the transformation subroutine at process step 304 the distance remaining to the beginning of a deceleration subspan is calculated by the process associated with process block 308. The steps of this process are illustrated in the flow chart of Figure 6 d . At process step 232 of Figure 6 d the time necessary to decelerate from the current velocity to zero velocity is calculated by dividing the current incremental velocity represented by the increment velocity signal V With reference to Figures 5 a and 6 b it is apparent that the deceleration subroutine differs in function from the acceleration subroutine in that it is used to achieve interpolation of the final velocity for the current span. The acceleration subroutine is used only to modify the increment velocity within the interpolation process. Figure 6 e is a flow chart of the deceleration subroutine. At process step 240 the incremental velocity signal is set equal to the modified increment velocity signal to begin deceleration. Execution continues through process steps 242 and 244 to produce a new value of incremental velocity effective for the first iteration of deceleration. At process step 246 the iteration counter is incremented. At process step 248 a value for the incremental distance ΔS is computed for the current iteratian. At process step 250 the accumulated span distance S Upon completion of execution of the transformation subroutine, execution of the deceleration subroutine is resumed at decision step 258 where it is determined whether or not the incremental velocity equals the final velocity previously established for the deceleration subroutine. If not, a new incremental velocity is calculated at process step 260 using the velocity of the current iteration and a velocity differential computed according to the deceleration period and the velocity difference computed when the deceleration subroutine execution was initiated. Thereafter, execution of the deceleration subroutine continues at process step 246. Process steps 246 through 260 are repeated until the deceleration subroutine produces the desired final velocity V Unlike the deceleration subroutine, the acceleration subroutine is an integral part of the interpolation process illustrated in the flow chart of Figure 6 b . The acceleration subroutine is illustrated by the flow chart in Figure 6 f . Execution of the acceleration subroutine begins at process step 272 where a new incremental velocity value V Further detailed description of the procedures associated with the auto mode shall be given beginning with reference to Figure 6 a . The pre interpolation data initialisation illustrated by Figure 6 a produces variable values used during the interpolation procedure. These values are computed using values represented by input signals defining two successive programmed tool centrepoint locations and a velocity therebetween, function element orientations, workpiece angular locations of rotations, and rotations of the positioner coordinate axes relative to the manipulator coordinate axes. The computation of process step 201 of coefficients for the manipulator to workpiece positioner coordinate transformation is illustrated in greater detail by the flow chart of Figure 7 e . Referring to Figure 7 e , computation of coefficients is illustrated at process step 570. The values of rotation J and O of coordinate axes of the manipulator relative to the positioner are used to produce the coefficients. Upon completion of the calculations of process step 570, execution of the procedure of Figure 6 a continues through terminal 572. As has been previously stated herein, the iterative interpolation of the intermediate points is controlled by the largest of the linear distances considering the linear span of tool centrepoint motion, the effective arc length produced by changes of orientation, and the arc length produced by rotation of the workpiece using the average value of the radial distance of the tool centrepoint from the axis of rotation of the workpiece. Referring again to Figure 6 a , process step 202 calls the programmed distance subroutine which computes both the tool centrepoint span length and the effective arc length for orientation moves. The subroutine also determines which of these values is the larger and stores the larger value as the programmed span length variable to be used by other routines of the motion control procedures. The programmed distance subroutine is illustrated by the flow chart of Figure 7 a . At process step 450 the tool centrepoint path distance is calculated. This path length S Referring again to the flow chart of Figure 6 a , following execution of the programmed distance subroutine, process step 203 calls for the execution of the linear distance subroutine which is illustrated by the flow chart of Figures 7 b and 7 c . The purpose of this subroutine is to compute the effective linear distance resulting from the combination of the linear motion of the tool centrepoint and the arc swept by the workpiece rotation. Referring to Figure 7 b process steps 470 and 472 transform the rectangular coordinates relative to the manipulator rectangular coordinate system of the programme locations P₀ and P₁ to values relative to the rectangular coordinates of the workpiece positioner coordinate system. These transformations are accomplished by calling the positioner transformation subroutine and executing the subroutine using the programmed location coordinates X₀, Y₀, and Z₀ and X₁, Y₁, and Z₁. The positioner transformation subroutine is illustrated by the flow chart of Figure 8 b which shall be described subsequently. Following transformation to the rectangular coordinate values for the workpiece positioner coordinate system, process steps 474 and 476 compute the radial distance from the axis of rotation of the workpiece positioner table to the programmed locations P₀ and P₁. These computations are carried out by a subroutine which is called by process steps 474 and 476 and which uses the coordinate values of the transformation executed by steps 470 and 472. The radius calculation subroutine is illustrated by the flow chart of Figure 8 c which shall be described subsequently. At decision step 478, it is determined whether or not the tool centrepoint motion commences within the velocity coordination envelope. It will be recalled that the velocity coordination envelope is described in terms of a radial limit distance from the axis of rotation to the workpiece positioner table and an axial limit distance along the workpiece positioner X axis from the table surface in the positive direction. Therefore, having computed the coordinates of the location P₀ with respect to the workpiece positioner coordinate system and the radial distance RD₀ of the location P₀ from the axis of rotation, it is necessary to compare the computed values X If the coordinates of the starting location P₀ are found to be within the velocity coordination envelope, execution of the linear distance subroutine proceeds at process step 480 where the velocity coordination status signal is set. At process step 482 the arc distance produced by rotation of the workpiece through the programmed angular change ΔW is computed using the average radius effective between locations P₀ and P₁, that is, the average of the radii RD₀ and RD₁. The workpiece surface arc distance is represented by an arc distance signal S Referring to Figure 7 c , decision step 486 compares the tangential deviation S At decision step 494 the arc length S If it had been determined at decision step 478 that the starting location P₀ was not within the velocity coordination envelope, execution would proceed at process step 498 where the velocity coordination status signal is reset. Thereafter at process step 500, the radius, which at the maximum rate of rotation of the workpiece produces the programmed velocity V Upon completion of execution of the linear distance computation subroutine, processing of the procedure of the flow chart of Figure 6 a continue with the execution of the relative velocity computation subroutine by the subroutine call of process step 205. The relative velocity computation subroutine is illustrated by the flow chart of Figure 7 d . Referring to Figure 7 d , it is determined at decision step 520 whether or not the velocity coordination status signal has been set. If the current programmed path does not require velocity coordination no action is executed by the subroutine and the processing of the routine of the flow chart of Figure 6 a is resumed by the return through terminal 526. If, on the other hand, the current span does require velocity coordination, execution proceeds at process step 522 where the time required to effect motion at the programmed velocity is computed. That is, the time T Referring to the flow chart of Figure 5 a it is noted that the procedure of Figure 6 a is executed once prior to the interpolation of intermediate points for each programmed span. Consequently, the procedures illustrated by the flow charts of Figures 7 a , 7 b , 7 c . 7 d and 7 e are executed once to produce values used during interpolation. To achieve the desired velocity coordination, it is necessary to permit adjustment of the incremental velocity signal with each iteration according to the rate of motion of the workpiece surface relative to the tool centrepoint. As the tool centrepoint traverses a path between programmed locations associated with different workpiece diameters, the velocity of the workpiece surface changes in proportion to the radius assuming a constant rate of workpiece rotation. This incremental adjustment of the incremental velocity signal V Referring to Figure 8 a , at decision step 532 it is determined whether or not the velocity coordination status signal is set. If the velocity coordination status signal is not set, no velocity modification occurs and execution of the procedure of Figure 6 b is resumed by the return of terminal 542. If the velocity coordination status signal is set, process step 536 calls the execution of the subroutine for transforming rectangular coordinates relative to the manipulator to rectangular coordinates of the workpiece positioner coordinate system using the rectangular coordinates of the intermediate point. Upon completion of execution of the transformation subroutine the subroutine for computing the radius from the axis of rotation of the workpiece to the intermediate point is called into execution by the subroutine call of process step 538. At process step 540 the radial distance from the axis of rotation of the workpiece to the intermediate point, represented by an intermediate radial distance signal RD Figure 8 b is a flow chart illustrating the procedure for transforming rectangular coordinates relative to the manipulator to the workpiece positioner rectangular coordinate system. The procedure accepts location coordinate signals and produces transformed coordinate signals. This transformation is accomplished by first computing the effective translation between the rectangular coordinates relative to the manipulator and the rectangular coordinates of the workpiece positioner coordinate system origin and then using these values represented by translational displacement signals to effect the rotations associated with the rotations of the axes of the workpiece positioner rectangular coordinate system relative to the axes of the manipulator rectangular coordinate system. At process step 550 the translational components are computed. At process step 552 the rotation of the coordinates is computed using the transformation cooefficients which were precomputed by the span data initialisation procedure. The coefficients are based upon the rotations of the workpiece positioner rectangular coordinates from the rectangular coordinates relative to the manipulator as represented by the input signals J and O. Upon completion of the transformation effected by the procedure of Figure 8 b the rectangular coordinates relative to the workpiece positioner are available for use in computing the radial distance from the axis of rotation of the workpiece to the intermedate location. The calculation of radius is effected by the procedure illustrated in Figure 8 c which uses the transformed rectangular coordinates to compute the radial distance. The radial distance RD₁ is computed as a square root of the sum of the squares of the Y and Z components relative to the workpiece positioner rectangular coordinate system of the intermediate point. This computation is carried out by process step 560. Return to the execution of the calling procedure is effected through terminal 562. As described herein, the control of coordinated motion of the workpiece rotation and manipulator translation and orientation, is achieved by interpolation of intermediate location, orientations and rotations. Interpolation is governed by a controlling distance, the largest of tool centrepoint translation, function element orientation and workpiece rotation. To produce the desired relative velocity between the tool centrepoint and workpiece surface, each iteration provides a modifed incremental velocity, as the tool centrepoint translation effects changes of radial distance of the tool centrepoint from the axis of rotation of the workpiece. Tool centrepoint translation which result in a substantial tangential component is accommodated by further rotation of programmed locations coordinates to the same frame of reference from starting to ending locations. In all cases, velocity coordination is accomplished in the automatic mode of operation using data defining coordinates of starting and ending locations, orientations and workpiece angular locations of successive programmed points, together with a programmed velocity defining the desired relative velocity between the tool centrepoint and workpiece surface. Automatic accommodation of rotations of the axis of rotation of the workpiece relative to axes of the manipulator rectangular coordinate system is achieved using further input data defining the magnitude of the rotations.
