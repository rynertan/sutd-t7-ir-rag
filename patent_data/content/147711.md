# SPOOL WINDING SYSTEM

## Abstract
The invention concerns a fine metal wire winding system, in particular for continuous electric welding wires the system comprises a spool 3 having a central core 4 for winding up the wire 12 , and lateral flanges 5 , said core 4 consisting of angularly spaced portions of cylindrical sur faces 4a . A chuck is also provided, having wire supporting members 11 arranged concentrically and insertable be tween said surface portions 4a of the core 4 so as to complete the cylindrical surface of the core 4 of the spool for winding the wire the wire supporting members 11 are provided, on the outer side 11a , or wire supporting side, with transversal grooves or scorings 13 with a helical flow, defining paths for winding the wire.
