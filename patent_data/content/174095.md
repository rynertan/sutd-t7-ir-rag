# Tracking control apparatus.

## Abstract
A tracking control apparatus for recording and or repro ducing signals on or from a rotating magnetic disc 2 having a plurality of concentric recording tracks, includes a trans ducer 11, 12 provided in contacting relation to the magnetic disc 2 , a motor 13 coupled to the transducer 11, 12 for moving the transducer 11, 12 in the radial direction of the magnetic disc 2 , a track status memory 51 for storing track identifying signals for each of the recording tracks, a level detecting circuit 54 for detecting levels of reproduced signals from the tracks, and a circuit 51, 65 for controlling the motor 13 for positioning the transducer 11, 12 in tracking relation to each of the tracks when either of the identifying signals indicates that the adjacent tracks on both sides are not digital data tracks, or the track is an analog data track, based on the outputs from the level detecting circuit 54 , otherwise the positioning motor 13 is mechanically controlled regardless of outputs from the level detecting circuit 54 .
