# A horizontal axis wind energy conversion system with aerodynamic blade pitch control.

## Abstract
The horizontal axis wind tubrine converts wind into electrical energy and includes a pitch control vane with a flyweight mechanism on each rotor blade to provide aerody namic efficiency at operating wind velocities, near constant speed and zero lift pitch of the rotor blades when speeds exceed the design speed of the system. A gravity neutraliza tion means composed of a bevel gear and pinions couples the blades together while a flyweight arrangement con nected to the bevel gear acts to neutralize centrifugal torque on the blades.
