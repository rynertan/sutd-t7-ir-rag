# Hybrid camera arrangement.

## Abstract
A hybrid exposure control system for a photographic camera apparatus controls exposure in response to both the firing of a quench strobe at an appropriate size aperture corresponding to the determined camera to subject dis tance and to the subsequent quenching of the strobe in response to the detection and integration of reflected strobe light from the scene in correspondence with the scene light admitted to the film plane. An increased degree of exposure correction can thus be made possible since a slight error in determining the camera to subject range can be compen sated by the detection and integration of reflected strobe light to provide a flash quenching signal.
