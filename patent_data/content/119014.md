In order that the invention may be fully understood, a preferred embodiment will now be described in detail by way of example and with reference to the drawing which is a schematic elevational side view of apparatus for separating a mixture of two or more liquids, the apparatus being shown empty and with the electrical wiring. The principles of the present invention are particularly useful when embodied in an apparatus for separating a mixture of three liquids of different density, such as the apparatus shown in the drawing and generally referred to by the numeral 10. The apparatus 10 is ideally suited for separating two or three liquids, such as petroleum and water, or petroleum, water and creosote. The apparatus 10 comprises an upright liquid container 12 having a liquid inlet 14., a lower liquid outlet 16, a bottom outlet 17, an upper liquid outlet 18, and a drain outlet 20 from the container bottom 22.A normally closed valve 24 is provided in the lower outlet 16 for controlling flow therethrough, a similar normally closed valve 26 is provided in the upper outlet 18 for controlling flow therethrough, and a similar normally closed valve 25 is provided in the bottom outlet 17 for controlling flow therethrough. The valves 24, 25, 26 are independent and are not operatively connected to each other. An upper group 27 of floats is provided within the container 12, specifically an upper group including a low float 28 at an elevational level above the level of the lower outlet 16 and the bottom outlet 17, a middle float 30 at an elevational level between the low float 28 and the upper outlet 18, and a high float 32 at a level adjacent to or above the level of the upper outlet 18. Below the upper group 27 of floats and below the low float 28 is a bottom float 33. Each of the floats 28, 30, 32, 33 extends through the wall of the container 12 and is pivotally mounted on a fulcrum 34.The middle float 30 is essentially an upper stratification float and it follows up and down an upper stratification level between the least dense liquid and a more dense liquid in the apparatus 10. The bottom float 33 is essentially a bottom stratification float and it follows up and down a bottom stratification level between the most dense liquid and a less dense liquid in the apparatus 10. The low float 28 is associated with a normally open switch 36 that is operatively connected to the lower outlet valve 24. The high float 32 likewise is associated with a normally open switch 38 connected to the upper outlet valve 26. The middle float 30 is associated with a normally closed switch 40 which is connected between a power line L1 and the high float switch 38.The middle float switch 40 and low float switch 36 are connected in parallel to the power line Ll. The bottom float 33 is associated with a normally open switch 39 connected to the bottom outlet valve 25. The bottom float switch 39 is connected to power line L1 in parallel with the low float switch 36 and middle float switch 40. The low, middle, high and bottom floats 28, 30, 32, 33 are each independently mounted in the container 12 and they are each operable completely independently of each other. All the floats 28, 30, 32, 33 are hollowThe low float 28, middle float 30 and bottom float 33 each may have a removable fluid tight sealing cap 42.The low float 28 and middle float 30 are filled with the least dense liquid, which gives these floats 28, 30 a specific gravity which is similar to and which is slightly more dense than the least dense liquid, but less dense than the more dense liquid. The high float 32 is airfilled and is of less density than any least dense liquid to be separated. The bottom float 33 is either filled with the most dense liquid or is ballasted to have a specific gravity greater than the more dense liquid but less than the most dense liquid. At the top of the container 12 and above the float group 27 and the high float 32 is a generally horizontal plate baffle 44 to smooth out and laminate the incoming flow of liquid. An overflow float 46 has a normally closed overflow switch 48 which is connected to power line L1 and to an inlet valve 50. If and when incoming liquid backs up on the baffle 44, the overflow float 46 rises and the switch 48 opens and the inlet valve 50 closes and terminates the incoming flow of liquid.Both the overflow switch 48 and the inlet valve may be of a graduated type for adjustable flow control. The overflow switch 48 is connected to power line L1 in parallel with the bottom float switch 39, low float switch 36 and middle float switch 40. In carrying out the method of the present invention, a mixture of two or three liquids of different densities is admitted into the container 12 through the inlet 14. The most dense liquid may be creosote, the more dense liquid is usually water, and the least dense liquid is usually a petroleum such as crude, fuel oil, diesel, gasoline, and the like. The low float 28 and middle float 30 are filled with the anticipated least dense liquid. The bottom float 33 is filled with the anticipated most dense liquid or alternatively is ballasted to a specific gravity which is greater than the more dense liquid. For example, if the more dense liquid is anticipated to be water, then the bottom float 33 may be set to have a specific gravity of 1.02. Alternatively, the floats 28, 30, 33 may be preweighted to a predetermined specific gravity and be adjustable several well known structures such ascounterweights are known for this purpose. With the apparatus 10 as shown, i.e.normally empty, the floats 28, 30, 32, 33 are all down and all three outlet valves 24, 25, 26 are closed. When the apparatus 10 is filled with the least dense liquid, for example oil, the low, middle and bottom floats 28, 30, 33 remain down and the high float 32 rises and closes switch 38, opening the upper outlet valve 26 and allowing the least dense liquid to flow out of the upper outlet 18. When the more dense liquid, for example water, begins to accumulate in the lower part of the apparatus 10, the low float 28 and bottom float 33 remain down even when the level of the more dense liquid is above the lower outlet 16. This gives the accumulated more dense liquid water time to coalesce and minimises the probability of the least dense liquid oil going out of the lower outlet 16. When the level of the more dense liquid rises above the low float 28, the low float 28 rises and closes switch 36 and thereby opens the lower outlet valve 24, so that the more dense liquid water flows out of the lower outlet 16. As the level of the more dense liquid rises, the middle float 30 rises and opens switch 40 which thereby de energises the high float switch 38. If the high float 32 is raised by liquid of any density, this effectively closes the upper outlet valve 26 and terminates outlet flow of the least dense liquid. The lower outlet valve 24 remains open and outlet flow of the more dense liquid continues until the level of the more dense liquid falls and retreats from the upper outlet 18. As the level of the more dense liquid falls, the middle float 30 also falls, and when switch 40 recloses the upper outlet valve 26 will re open provided that the high float 32 is raised by the presence of least dense liquid.The upper outlet valve 26 is closed when either of the high float 32 or middle float 30 is lowered. If and when most dense liquid is introduced into the apparatus 10, it settles by gravity to the bottom 22. As the quantity of most dense liquid increases, its level will move upwards and cover the closed bottom outlet 17 and eventually reach the bottom float 33.When the bottom float 33 is lifted by a rising level of most dense liquid, the normally open bottom float switch 39 is closed and the bottom outlet valve 25 is opened to allow flow of the most dense liquid out of the bottom outlet 17. When the level of the most dense liquid falls, the bottom float 33 also falls and the bottom float switch 39 re opens and the bottom outlet valve 25 closes. The lower outlet 16 is positioned at an elevational level which is closer to the level of the low float 28 than to the level of the bottom float 33, and the bottom float 33 is at a level closer to the level of the lower outlet 16 than to the level of the bottom outlet 17. The vertical spacing between the bottom outlet 17 and the lower outlet 16 is greater than the vertical spacing between the lower outlet 16 and the upper outlet 18. This apparatus and method have several unique advantages. All three outlets 16, 17, 18 can be concurrently open. As the stratification level between a more dense and the least dense liquids approaches the lower outlet 16, the lower outlet valve 24 is closed. As this stratification level approaches the upper outlet 18, the upper outlet valve 26 closes. The height of the container 12 and the spacing between the floats 28, 30,32 determines the range and sensitivity of the opening and closing of the upper outlet valve 26 and lower outlet valve 24. The apparatus 10 lends itself to gravity flow with no pressure, or to full pressurisation a given apparatus 10 may work with either gravity or pressure. The apparatus 10 can also be used for reclaiming mixtures of cooking oils and shortening that are physically discrete from one another. The more dense liquid need not be water it could be a fuel oil, or a solvent.The apparatus 10 is also thought to be useful for the separation of PENTA type wool preservatives and carbon tetrachloride. In a test of the apparatus 10, the container was sized at 800 gallons US capacity 3027 dm3 and used to clean a two acre 0.8 hectare settling pond in a railroad yard. The pond was about 4 feet 1.37 metres deep and filled with a mixture of 5 oil, water, creosote and sludge. In seven days, the apparatus 10 extracted 64,000 gallons US 242,260 dm3 of re usable creosote containing less than 3 water.
