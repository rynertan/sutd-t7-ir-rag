## Description
The present invention relates to hypocholesterolemic active products, processes for producing the same, pharmaceutical preparations containing the same, and a novel strain of the genus As is well known in the art, pharmaceutical preparations such as clofibrate containing preparations have been proposed as a therapeutical or preventive medicine suitable for atherosclerosis or hyperlipidemia, which is one of a typical middle aged or geriatric disease. However, the desired purposes are not fully satisfied by these known medicines from the viewpoint of, for example, pharmacological effects and side effects, and therefore, there is a need to develop more effective medicines. Furthermore, FR A 2411008 discloses that certain strains of An object of the present invention is to provide novel bacterial cell products capable of effectively reducing the serum cholesterol level in mammals, and to provide processes for preparing a bacterial cell products capable of effectively reducing the serum cholesterol level in mammals, pharmaceutical preparations containing the bacterial cell products. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a novel strain of In accordance with the present invention, there is provided the use of dead cells, living cells, or mixtures thereof of microorganisms belonging to the genus In accordance with the present invention, there is further provided a novel strain of The products and compositions are used for lowering the serum cholesterol level of mammals by orally administering them to the mammals. The present inventors have found that various living cells and dead cells of microorganisms belonging to the genus The types and morphological characteristics, the screening methods, the preparation methods of strains, and the pharmacological effects of the microorganisms according to the present invention will now be explained in detail hereinbelow. Microorganisms suitable for use in the preparation of the bacterial cell product according to the present invention are those belonging to the genus The general microbiological characteristics of the microorganisms in the present invention are the same as those of known microorganisms belonging to the same class. That is, the general microbiological characteristics, cultivation methods, and other properties correspond to those described in the following articles The typical microbiological characteristics of the above exemplified strains according to the present invention are summarized in Table 1. The cultivation of these microorganisms is conventional as mentioned above. For example, the bacterial cells of The resultant cells can be directly used as a pharmaceutical agent in the form of living cells or dead cells obtained by, for example, heat treatment, or in the form of the cells destroyed by, for example, ultrasonic treatment. The term dead cells used herein means the entire portions or partial portions of the above mentioned destroyed cells. The dead cells can be also used as a starting material for fractionating, extracting, and purifying active elements contained therein. This is because the desired pharmacological activities i.e., hypocholesterolemic activity in mammals are based on substance components contained in the cells, and because not only the living cells but also the dead cells have these pharmacological activities. The screening of the microorganisms can be carried out by a method of Mituoka, T., 1971 , J. Jap. Assoc. Infect. Dis. As described in this literature, faeces obtained from healthy adults were diluted 10 fold in the following diluent and were smeared on MPN agar Tanaka, R. et al. 1980 Appl. Environ. Microbiol. The living cells and dead cells of the microorganisms used in the present invention, suitable for use as a hypocholesterolemic agent, are typically prepared as follows Each strain of the above mentioned microorganisms is inoculated into 5 liters of the above mentioned GAM broth medium in the case of The living cells obtained as mentioned in the above Example are further washed twice with physiological saline 0.85 NaCl solution and are then suspended in the same solution. Fifty ml of the cell suspension was thus obtained, and was heated at 115 C for 10 minutes to form the desired cell suspension containing the dead cells. As shown in the examples hereinbelow, and LD50 of the living cells embodying the present invention is 4.9 x 10⁹ to 8.3 x 10⁹ cells mouse intraperitoneal administration and that of the dead cells is more than 6 x 10¹⁰ cells mouse intraperitoneal administration . Both the living and dead cells are substantially nontoxic on oral administration. The present invention will now be further illustrated by, the following examples. To obtain a dead cell sample, the above mentioned living cell sample was further washed twice with physiological saline 0.85 NaCl solution and was then suspended in the same solution. Fifty ml of the cell suspension was thus obtained and heated at 115 C for 10 minutes to form the desired cell suspension containing 10¹¹ cells ml. These samples were lyophilized and orally administered at a dosage corresponding to 10¹¹ cells day to GBH 9, HF, and conventional rats Fischer 344 rats, 13 16 week old males, average body weight of 240 g, 10 males in each group for 8 weeks. GBH 9 rats gnotobiotic rats inoculated with The cholesterol level was determined by using Moreover, determinations similar to these mentioned above were made with newborn rats 21 day old and conventionalized rats ex germfree rats housed for five weeks under conventional conditions . The results are shown in Table 2 living cells and Table 3 dead cells . Reduction rates listed in these tables are the reduction rates to the serum cholesterol levels of the control groups which are not dosed with the sample. The composition by weight of the diet is shown in Table 4. Living cells of bacteria prepared according to the above mentioned living cell preparation method were intraperitoneally administered to ICR mice 6 week old males, average body weight of 30.0 0.7 g with 0.5 mg of a bacterial suspension containing 9 x 10⁹, 9 x 10⁸ and 9 x 10⁷ cells per mouse 10 mice in each group . Thanatobiologic observation of the mice was carried out for 14 days. The LD50 values viable cell number mouse calculated according to a Behrens Kärber method are shown in Table 5. In the case of the dead cells of the above mentioned strains the LD50 values corresponded to more than 6 x 10¹⁰ cells mouse intraperitoneal dosage . Both the living and dead cells of the above mentioned strains were nontoxic in oral administration. 1. A 50 mg amount corresponding to 5 x 10¹⁰ cells of freeze dried powder of A tablet obtained from 500 mg of the above mentioned freeze dried powder by mixing with 500 mg of purified starch powder corresponds to a dosage of 10¹⁰ cells kg body weight. Thus, the cell products can be converted into the desired dosage form having a predetermined activity by mixing with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers based on the above mentioned standard dosage.
