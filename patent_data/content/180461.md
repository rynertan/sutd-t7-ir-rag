# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO DIGITAL TO ANALOGUE CONVERTERS

## Abstract
An interpolating digital to analogue converter 2 comprises a combiner 4 for receiving a digital input signal. The output sig nal of the combiner is fed via a digital controller 6 to one step quantiser 8. The output signal of the one step quantiser 8 is fed via a feedback loop 10 to the combiner 4, where it is combined with the digital input signal, and also to an analogue filter to provide a voltage output which is proportional to the digital in put signal. The digital controller 6 may comprise an optimum con troller, such as a type 1, type 2 or type 3 controller, and is chosen according to the resolution required.
