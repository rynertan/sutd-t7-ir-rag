# Spread spectrum transmitter and receiver.

## Abstract
A spread spectrum carrier wave device, such as an altimeter, is provided having a transmitter 11 27 in close proximity to a receiver 28 56 . The transmitted signals which are electromagnetically coupled in to the receiving system as undesirable signals, are removed from the receiv ing path by generating a replica of the undesired signals and applying the to an input of an adaptive processor 46 together with the signals in the receiving path. After the undesired signals are removed by the process of adaptive nulling, the desirable signals are recovered and processed.
