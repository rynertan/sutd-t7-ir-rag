# Aminoalkyl substituted benzene derivatives, process for production thereof, and pharmaceutical composition thereof.

## Abstract
An animoalkyl substituted benzene derivative represented by the formula CHEM wherein R1 represents a member selected from the class consisting of a hydrogen atom, lower alkyl groups, lower alkoxy groups, lower aliphatic acyl groups, halogen atoms and a trifluoroethoxy group R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group R3 represents ONO2, CF3 or F R4 and R5, independently from each other, represent a member selected from the class consisting of a hydrogen atom, lower alkyl groups, halogen substituted benzoyl groups, phenyl substituted lower aliphatic acyl groups and a pyridinecarbonyl group, or R4 and R5 may form, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded, a 6 membered hetero ring which may contain another hetero atom selected from O and N X1 and X2, independently from each other, represents an alkylene group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and B represents O or NHCO in which the nitrogen atom of NHCO is bonded to a carbon atom of the benzene ring and an acid addition salt thereof a process for production thereof and pharmaceutical composition thereof.
