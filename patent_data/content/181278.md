# FLEXIBLE SPOKE ROTOR FOR MULTIPLE DISK REFINER

## Abstract
A multi disk refiner 10 utilizing a plurality of spaced rotor disks 20 to 27 which rotate in a housing 11 in spaced relation to a plurality of spaced stator disks 32 to 37 , the confronting disks having ribs thereon which abrade a stock suspension passing in the space between the rotor 20 to 27 and stator disks 32 to 37 . In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a plurality of flexible rotors 44 to 47 which have spokes extending therefrom, the spokes being received in slots in loosely fitting relation so as to permit relative sliding movement between the spokes and the rotor disks 20 to 27 while transmitting torque. A resilient bumper 64 is provided on each of the spokes to provide a pivot point within the slot such that axial movement of the rotor disks 20 to 27 provides a simple bending load to each spoke thereby defining a soft, linear spring system.
