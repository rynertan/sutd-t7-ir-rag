## Description
The present invention relates, in general, to probes and, in particular, to a contact probe arranged for detecting dislodgment of the probe from a body to which it has been attached and apparatus for providing an indication of such dislodgement. Many probes are in use today to measure or monitor a function of the body to which the probe is attached or to control or influence a body state or condition. For example, the thermal environment of an infant incubator may be regulated by sensing the body temperature of the infant and developing a signal, representative of the infant s body temperature, for controlling the incubator heater. In such an application, it is important that intimate contact, between the skin and the probe contact surface which carries the temperature sensor, be established and maintained. Should the probe become dislodged, resulting in a total or partial loss of contact, the heater will respond to a temperature measurement other than the infant s body temperature. One approach, currently in use, for detecting probe dislodgement involves using information directly from the function being monitored. A significant deviation in the measurement of a body function may be the result of a significant change in the body function itself or the result of the measuring probe being dislodged from the body. In either case, an indication of the condition should be developed. While such an approach may be adequate for certain applications to sense a complete dislodgement of the probe, a partial dislodgement may produce an inadequate deviation and go unnoticed. Also, in some applications, the function being monitored may not change so appreciably upon probe dislodgement as to produce an adequate indication. For example, in an incubator, the ambient temperature is approximately equal to the temperature of the infant. Therefore, when a probe attached to the infant becomes dislodged and exposed to the thermal environment of the incubator, there may be very little, if any, immediate change in the output of the temperature sensor. Another technique which has been suggested for detecting probe dislodgement involves sensing impedance changes due to changing contact conditions between the probe and the body. This approach has met with only limited acceptance. It has been found that various other factors besides loss of contact between the probe and the body affect the impedance. As a result, this technique does not provide adequate reliability. GB A 2 059 053 and GB A 2 061 496 each disclose an optical technique for detecting probe dislodgement. Each apparatus senses a change in the level of radiation impinging upon the body contact surface of the probe when the probe is dislodged from the body. Although the techniques disclosed are extremely useful in effectively detecting probe dislodgement, the particular apparatus disclosed require the addition of optical components to the probe structure and special circuitry to protect against false alarms. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide new and improved apparatus for detecting the dislodgement of an article, such as a probe, from a body to which the article has been attached and for developing an indication when such dislodgement occurs. It is another object of the present invention to provide such apparatus which is reliable in operation, relatively simple in construction, and may be fabricated at reasonable cost. Apparatus constructed in accordance with the present invention includes a temperature responsive element having a characteristic which varies as a function of its temperature and which is adapted for contact with a body for sensing the proximity of the element to the body. The apparatus also includes means for periodically heating the temperature responsive element and for developing a control signal which varies in accordance with the temperature characteristic of the temperature responsive element. The control signal, thus, is representative of the heating of the element and the heat dissipated from the element. The level of the control signal changes during each periodic heating of the temperature responsive element at a rate dependent upon the dissipation of heat from the temperature responsive element. The apparatus further includes means responsive to the control signal for developing during the period of heating of the temperature responsive element an indication of the proximity of the temperature responsive element to the body. An additional aspect of the present invention is that when it is applied to a body temperature sensing probe, the temperature responsive element which serves to sense the temperature of the body to which the probe is attached also may serve to sense dislodgement of the probe from the body. Referring to the drawings The apparatus illustrated in Figure 1 shows the manner in which the present invention may be applied to indicate the dislodgement of a body temperature sensing probe from a body to which the probe has been attached. This apparatus includes a probe 10 having a probe housing 12 and a thermistor 14. As shown in Figure 2, thermistor 14 is positioned in a contact surface 12a of the probe housing which is adapted for contact with a body. Thermistor 14 may be of conventional construction and operation. A BR14KA512J thermistor sold by Thermometrics, Inc. may be used. Such a device has a characteristic which varies as a function of its temperature. Specifically, thermistor 14 may have a negative temperature coefficient such that its electrical resistance varies inversely with the temperature to which the thermistor is exposed. As a voltage is applied to thermistor 14, a signal is developed across the thermistor which varies in accordance with its resistance, thereby providing an indication of the temperature to which the thermistor is exposed. The level of the applied voltage is such that the current flow produced is so small that the self heating effect due to this current flow may be neglected. Returning to Figure 1, the apparatus also includes a source 16 of fixed voltage V₁ which is coupled to thermistor 14 through a current limiting resistor 18. This arrangement produces a first signal component across thermistor 14 which is representative of the temperature of the body to which probe 10 is attached. Figure 3 is a waveform diagram which shows the signal V After probe 10 is attached to a body having a temperature higher than the temperature to which thermistor 14 has been exposed, the increased temperature causes the resistance of the thermistor to drop, thereby reducing the thermistor signal V The Figure 1 apparatus further includes means for periodically heating thermistor 14 and for developing a control signal which is representative of such heating and the heat dissipated from the thermistor. Such means may include a pulse amplitude control circuit 20 which supplies a regulated voltage V₄ through an electronic switch 22 and a resistor 24 to thermistor 14. The action of switch 22 opening and closing develops an series of pulse signals which periodically heat thermistor 14. This produces a second signal component across thermistor 14 which is representative of the heating of the thermistor and the heat dissipated from the thermistor. The action of switch 22 is controlled by a timing control circuit 26 which will be described in greater detail hereinafter. As seen from Figure 3, the signal across thermistor 14 rises sharply to a level V₅ as the voltage from pulse amplitude control circuit 20 is coupled to thermistor 14 when switch 22 is closed. Voltage V₄ is shown in Figure 3 by dot dash lines. The difference between voltage V₄ and voltage V₅ is the voltage drop across resistor 24. Decay curve 102 in Figure 3 represents the effect of self heating of thermistor 14 due to the application of voltage V₅ to the thermistor. As the thermistor temperature rises due to self heating, the thermistor voltage drops. At the same time, thermistor 14 dissipates heat during the heating period. Rising curve 104 solid line represents the effect of heat dissipated from thermistor 14 with the thermistor in contact with a body, while rising curve 106 dashed line represents the effect of heat dissipated from the thermistor with the thermistor dislodged from the body. While in contact with a body, more heat is dissipated by thermistor 14, thereby tending to lower the thermistor temperature and causing a larger signal to be developed across the thermistor, than with the thermistor dislodged from the body. Decay curves 108 solid line and 110 dashed line show the net effects on the thermistor signal V When switch 22 is opened, voltage V₄ is removed. This drives the thermistor signal V From the foregoing, it is seen that the self heating of thermistor 14 resulting from the application and removal of voltage V₄ provides a second signal component representative of the proximity of the thermistor to a body. Each pulse applied to the thermistor produces a positive going portion during the heating period and a negative going portion during the cooling period. The positve going portion decays during the pulse at a rate dependent upon the dissipation of heat from the thermistor and the negative going rises subsequent to the heating period also at a rate dependent upon the dissipation of heat from the thermistor. Accordingly, the Figure 1 apparatus includes means responsive to the second signal component of the thermistor signal V The thermistor signal V The operation of the Figure 1 apparatus will be best understood by reference to Figure 4. Timing control circuit 26 supplies a first series and a second series of timing control pulses T₁ and T₂. Timing control pulses T₁ control the the closing of switch 30, while timing control pulses T₂ control the closing of switches 22 and 36. During time t₁, when switch 30 is closed, the thermistor signal V During the closure of switches 22 and 36, the thermistor signal is supplied through switch 36 to comparitor 38. Comparitor 38 may be of conventional construction and operation in receiving two inputs and providing an output representative of the relationship of the inputs. As seen from Figure 4, when timing control pulses T₂ close switch 22 during time periods t₂, positive going signals are developed across the thermistor. These signals, riding on the body temperature component of the thermistor signal, are coupled through switch 36 to the lower input to comparitor 38. As indicated above, the output of sample and hold circuit 32 is coupled to the upper input to comparitor 38. The output signal from sample and hold circuit 32 serves as a reference in determining whether probe 10 has been dislodged from the body to which it has been attached. Amplifier and linearizing circuit 28 is designed to produce a signal from the thermistor signal which, during timing control pulses T₁, will fall between the two thermistor signal levels denoting that probe 10 is in contact with the body or that the probe has been dislodged from the body. Continuing with the example given above, if the thermistor signal V Timing control circuit 26 may be of conventional construction and operation in providing accurately shaped timing pulses at the required frequency and relative timings. In order to assure that the proximity component of the thermistor signal V In order to prevent alarm system 40 from being set off falsely by the output of comparitor 38 during the periods between timing control pulses T₂, an inverter 42, an electronic switch 44, a resistor 46 and source 48 of fixed voltage are provided in the Figure 1 apparatus. These components are effective in disabling comparitor 38 from developing an output signal which would signify a loose probe condition. Inverter 42 controls switch 44 to close the switch during the periods between timing control pulses T₂. When this occurs, the voltage from source 48 is coupled through resistor 46 and switch 44 to the lower input of comparitor 38 such that the respective inputs to the comparitor prevent the comparitor from developing an output signal corresponding to a loose probe condition. As seen in Figure 1, the output of sample and hold circuit 32 is connected to pulse amplitude control circuit 20. This causes voltage level V₄ to track the body temperature last sampled before the initiation of a timing control pulse T₂. As a result, an equivalent amount of power is dissipated each time thermistor 14 is heated regardless of the thermistor resistance which varies with temperature.
