# CONDUIT CABLE SUPPORT

## Abstract
The invention relates to conduits for carrying and protecting cables and particularly to carrier supports within said conduits which support cables or other utility carriers. The carrier supports serve to protect the cables from abrasive contact with the conduit and comprise elongated extruded malleable members whose outer surfaces conform to the inner wall of the conduit. A plurality of extruded cavities are provided within the extruded member which are symmetrically oriented about a line central to the member, each cavity having a common wall along contact points between cavities and the outer covering of the extruded member. Support barriers are provided between the cavities and the outer walls to maintain the cavity form.
