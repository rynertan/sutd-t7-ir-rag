U.S. pat. appln. No. 256,918 . In the formula I , the C1 C5 alkanoyl includes illustratively formyl, acetyl, propionyl, butyryl and valeryl, and acetyl is preferred. The substituted sulfonyl includes illustratively C1 C5 alkanesulfonyl such as methanesulfonyl, ethanesulfonyl, propanesulfonyl, butanesulfonyl and pentanesulfonyl, preferably methanesulfonyl mesyl and C C arenesulfonyl such as benzenesulfonyl, toluenesulfonyl, or xylenesulfonyl, preferably 4 toluenesulfonyl tosyl . The compounds of formula I can be prepared by the following scheme Route A Route BEMI2.1 in which R1 is C1 C5 alkanoyl, R2 is C C alkyl, R3 is C1 C5 alkyl or C6 C8 aryl, and X, X1 and Y are each independently halogen e.g. chlorine, bromine, etc. . Route A 2 Guanidino 4 alkanoyloxymethyl thiazole Ia is prepared by reacting 1 alkanoyloxy 3 halo 2 propanone II with guanylthiourea in an inert solvent such as acetone, , dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, or pyridine. The reaction may be performed at roan derliure or under heating at up to lOO0C, preferably 20 to 700C. Then the above product Ia is subjected to hydrolysis with an inorganic base such as alkali metal hydroxide e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide , alkali metal hydrogencarbonate e.g. potassium hydrogencarbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate or alkali metal carbonate e.g.potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate . The reaction may be performed at room temperature about 15 to 200C or under heating at u,o to 1000C in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, dioxane, acetone2 dimethylsulfoxide or water or a mixed solvent thereof. Thus 2 guanidino 4 hydroxymethylthiazole m is prepared in a good yield. The starting l alkanoyloxy 3 halo 2 propanone II is prepared by reacting epihalohydrin with an alkanoic acid to give l alkanoyloxy 3 halo 2 propanol and oxidizing the resulting propanol with a Jones reagent.

The reaction is performed at room temperature to the boiling point of the solvent, in an appropriate solvent, for instance tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diglyme or toluene. Thus 2 guanidino 4 hydroxymethylthiazole Ib is prepared in a good yield. The above product Ib is converted into 2 guanidino 4 substituted sulfonyloxymethyl thiazole Ic by reacting the compound Ib with an alkanesulfonyl or arenesulfonyl halide v in the presence of a base such as pyridine or triethylamine. The reaction may be performed in a solvent such as acetone, toluene, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, or hexameth1phosphoric triamide at room temperature.
