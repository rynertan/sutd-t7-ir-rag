# DTMF telephone set with multiple use of the logic of the digital tone generator.

## Abstract
Electronic telephone set having DTMF tone dialling. By some slight additions to the logic circuits of the digital DTMF tone generator this tone generator is made suitable for gen erating a two tone ringing signal, for supervising the fre quency of the incoming ringing voltage and for generating a tone interval of approximately 0.1 s for the call back function.
