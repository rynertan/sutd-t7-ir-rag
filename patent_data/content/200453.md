# Coupling device for submarine pipeline systems.

## Abstract
A demountable coupling device for submarine pipeline sections 33, 34, 35 where one or a plurality of conduits can be connected together on the seabed by a remotely control led operation without the use of divers or guidewires. The connection of the pipeline sections, which are provided with square flanges 2 , takes place by vertical movement of the coupling unit 1 of the coupling device, which is provided with a groove 1 at each of its ends, the grooves being adapted for reception of the largely vertical portions of the pipeline flanges 2 when in an operating position on the seabed. The casing 1 of the coupling unit contains all components which are necessary for the connections. Once the C shaped grooves 1 of the coupling unit are engaged by the pipeline flanges 2 , connection takes place by moving telescopically displacable connecting tubes 4, 19, 24 of the casing 1 into corresponding bushings 16, 25 in the respective conduits of the pipeline flanges 2 to ensure effective seal tightening. The coupling operation is reversi ble, and mounting can take place independent of the order of the demounting. To achieve a prestressing of the respective pipeline flanges 2 against the coupling unit, prestressing devices are placed in the casing of the coupling 1 . The coupling is secured by means of a locking mechanism 53, 54, 56 .
