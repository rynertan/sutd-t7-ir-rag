# Liquid carbon dioxide extraction of pyrethrins and a purified pyrethrin composition.

## Abstract
Pyrethrum flowers are extracted with liquid carbon dioxide in suitable equipment to yield a pale, transparent, concentrated extract of pyrethrins. The extract is useful as the active material in safe insecticidal formulations. Alternatively, crude oleoresin produced by extraction of pyrethrum with organic solvents can also be purified by treatment with liquid carbon dioxide.
