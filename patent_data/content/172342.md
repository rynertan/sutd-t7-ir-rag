# Bus control gate array.

## Abstract
In a computer having a central processing unit CPU 9 , a common bus 1, 3, 5 , a plurality of input and output devices which are connected to the common bus 1, 3, 5 and which have an intrinsic I O device address, individually, and a bus control gate array, the bus control gate array according to the present invention includes an I O device address decoder 47 . The I O device address decoder 47 comprises a plurality of gates 53, 55...57 and decodes an I O device address supplied from the CPU 9 to produce a control signal for selecting the designated I O device thereto.
