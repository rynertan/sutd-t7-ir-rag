# SURFACE TREATED SOFT CONTACT LENSES

## Abstract
A hydrophilic polymer shaped article suitable for use as a soft contact lens is treated with an alkyl ester of an alkylene dicarboxylic acid, wilere the alkyl groups are CH₃ or C₂H₅ and the alkylene group is C₁ to C₆, so as to provide, at least on the surfaces thereof a less hydrophilic polymeric structure. The effect of the modi fying treatment is to inhibt penetration of the polymer shape by proteins and other substances in the eye environment, whereby the development of clduding and discolouration of the lens material during us is signifi cantly reduced.
