# Improved apparatus for measuring the wear of railroad rail.

## Abstract
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a chassis 15 adapted for travel along a railroad rail 11 with the chassis 15 having a plurality of bearing points 17 located between the chassis 15 and the rail 11 for supporting the chassis 15 on the rail 11 and for allowing movement of the chassis 15 over the rail 11 . The bearing points 17 are aligned along a reference line 13 and are at least variably spaced on opposite sides of a sensing point 19 mounted on the chassis 15 . At least one bearing point 17 on each side of the sensing point 19 contacts the rail surface 11 as the chassis 15 moves over the rail 11 . A sensing device 19 is provided at the sensing point 19 for continuosly sensing the distance between the reference line 13 and the surface on the rail 11 as the chassis 15 travels along the rail 11 . The sensing device 19 has an output which is a function of the sensed distance between the reference line 13 and the rail surface 11 . A device 20 , such as a strip recorder, is responsive to the output of the sensing device 19 to indicate the corrugations and undula tions in the rail surface 11 .
