# A method of constructing a panel assembly.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a panel assembly for use as a door or as a section of a wall. Known panelled doors, for example, comprise vertical stiles 23 and hori zontal rails 25 which are first jointed together to form a main framework, in fill panels being subsequently secured in position in the various apertures 11 defined by the main framework. However, often these apertures 11 are not exactly the size required for particular in fill panels due to manufacturing tolerances in the production of the main framework, and the panels have to be trimmed and the beading for securing the panels in the framework, has to be custom cut to individual requirements. Whilst this pro vides manufacturing problems, these problems are all the more severe, if the selection and fitting of desired in fill panels is left to the purchaser. The present invention overcomes the above problems by providing a preformed fixed frame 1 which is secured between contiguous elongate framework members 23, 25 of the main framework. The apertures 11 in the frame work 23, 25 are thus initially fixed and a purchaser or manufacturer can easily insert selected in fill panels 12 and secure them in position by securing a completion fra me 39 to the fixed frame 1 .
