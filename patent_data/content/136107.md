# Bandsaw blades for milling timber.

## Abstract
A bandsaw blade for use in milling timber having in line 3 swaged teeth, wherein the cutting tip of each tooth, in front profile, is triangular in shape with a central apical point 30 and two side points 32, 34 . Preferably, the apical angle ϑ is from 80 to 130 , with the base angles γ of the tip being equal to one another and lying from 20 to 60 , thus providing an elon gate pentagon shape in front profile. Also, a dark blue temper band 50 may be curved so that its top is spaced below the apical point 30 by a distance of 0.5 to 1.3 times, preferably 0.6 to 1.2 times, the blade thickness. A method of preparing the inventive blade is also provided.
