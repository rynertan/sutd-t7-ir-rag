# Weakly acidic cation exchange resins and process for producing same.

## Abstract
Weakly acidic cation exchange resins obtained by re reacting glyoxylic acid and a polyvinyl alcohol cross linked by cross linking groups each containing two or more carbon atoms, and having an exchange capacity of 3 meq g or more and a swelling volume of 10 ml g or less, as well as a process for producing such cation exchange resins are described.
