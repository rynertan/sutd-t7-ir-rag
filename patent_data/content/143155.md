# PHOTOELECTRIC KEY SWITCH DEVICE

## Abstract
The disclosed device prevents the error of the output timings of electric signals from a group of light receiving elements 6 and operates an electric processing unit by means of the signals which are simultaneously produced. The key switch device includes a rotor 2 equipped with a notch 9 which forms optical paths between all of the ele ments 5b, 6b of a group of light emitting elements 5 and light receiving elements 6 other than one set of elements 5a, 6a when a key 4 is inserted into the rotor 2 and the rotor 2 is rotated through a predetermined angle, and with another notch 10 which forms an optical path between the set of elements 5a, 6a excluded above when the rotor 2 is further rotated by an angle Î±.
