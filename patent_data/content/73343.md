# Titanium dioxide pigment treated to suppress yellowing in polymers.

## Abstract
A titanium dioxide pigment is provided for use in poly meric compositions comprising a pyrogenic titanium diox ide pigment which has been treated with a composition comprising an organophosphate alkanolamine, addition product. This invention provides for a novel method for treating a pyrogenic titanium dioxide pigment in order to reduce yellowing when such pigment is incorporated into a poly meric composition comprising adding to such pigment a composition which comprises an organophosphate alkanolamine addition product.
