# Torque transmitting apparatus.

## Abstract
Torque transmitting apparatus 10 including a shiftable sleeve member 12 having locking and guiding splines 26a and b for coupling a first toothed member 14 having external teeth 34 to either one of a pair of toothed members 16 , having external teeth 20 , and spaced on axially opposites sides thereof. Each locking spline 26a has working faces 40 whose ends include recesses 38 for axially holding the sleeve member during the transmission of torque to prevent undesirable disengagement during the transmission of torque. The recesses at each end of each locking spline 26a are spaced from each other with substantially the same minimum chordal relationship as the end of each of the other locking splines. Each guiding spline 26b has working faces 44 which are spaced so that the chordal thickness therebetween is substantially equal to or less than the corresponding minimum chordal thickness between the recesses at the ends of each locking spline. When the sleeve member 12 is shifted on the first toothed member 14 into engagement with one of the toothed members 16 , the relationship between the locking and guiding splines is such that the guiding splines serve to maintain proper axial alignment between the three members 12, 14, 16 and the locking splines serve to prevent undesirable axial disengagement of the locking spline 26a of sleeve member 12 from the teeth 20 of the toothed member 16 during torque transmission. The guiding splines 26b also cooperate with the teeth 34 of member 14 while disengaging the locking teeth 26a from the teeth 20 of member 16 to axially guide the sleeve member 12 in the opposite direction. In one preferred embodiment, the locking and guiding splines are arranged in an alternating relationship with each other. Another preferred relationship has three guiding splines preferably equally circumferentially spaced with respect to each other about the sleeve member.
