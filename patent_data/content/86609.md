# Carbon artifact grade pitch and manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
A pitch suitable for carbon artifact manufacture i contains from 80 to 100 percent toluene insolubles, ii has been derived from a substantially deasphaltenated middle fraction which is rich in 3, 4, 5 and 6 polycondensed aromatic ring compounds and or is from a coal distillate feedstock, and iii is substantially free of impurities and ash, and or has less than 15 wt quinoline insolubles. The pitch is suitably prepared by heat soaking a said deasphaltenated middle fraction and subsequently removing oils therefrom by sub atmospheric pressure stripping.
