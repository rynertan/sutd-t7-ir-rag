# Printer and paper insertion device suitable therefor.

## Abstract
A printer comprises a first paper feed passage 9 extending from the rear of a platen 6 to a printing position through the lower part of the platen 6 , and a second paper feed passage 10 , 11 extending from substantially just under the printing position to the printing position. A first pinch roller 7 is disposed on the way to the first paper feed passage 9 for pressing a first paper against the platen 6 . The first paper is fed by rotating the platen 6 . A second pinch roller 8 is disposed on the way to the second paper feed passage 10 , 11 for pressing the second paper against the platen 6 . Rotation of the platen 6 here causes the second paper to be fed. In addition, a paper insertion device according to the present invention includes a flat part for placing a paper thereon and a slit 20 for converting the advance direction of a paper from horizontal to vertical one. With said second paper placed on said flat part and inserted into the printer 6 , the paper is directed upward after the curved surface of the slit 20 and allowed to enter the second paper feed passage 10 , 11 with ease for further advance.
