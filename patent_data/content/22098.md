# Apparatus for reducing finely divided iron oxide material.

## Abstract
Apparatus for reducing finely divided iron oxide material, comprising a reactor 1 containing a vertical upper reaction chamber 2 connected downwardly to a narrower, vertical reaction chamber 3 . A cyclone separator 8 is connected to the upper reaction chamber for separating solid material and recycling it to the reactor so that a circulating fluidized bed can be maintained in the apparatus. In accordance with the invention, a recycling conduit 9 is connected to the bottom of the lower reaction chamber 3 . A tapping off shaft 11 for reduced material is also connected to the bottom of the lower reaction chamber 3 . A reducing agent is supplied to the upper reaction chamber and combustion air is supplied to the bottom of the upper reaction chamber. The apparatus also comprises means for preheating the iron oxide material with the exhaust gas from the reactor and for passing said preheated iron oxide into the lower reaction chamber. The apparatus also comprises means for stripping the exhaust gas from CO₂ and H₂O and recycling it to the reactor to be used as fluidizing gas.
