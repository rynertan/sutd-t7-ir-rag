# Electrode for living body.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a metal electrode for a living body, which comprises a noble metal wire and an insulating covering layer formed around the periphery of the noble metal wire. At least a part of the portion of the insulating covering layer falling in contact with the noble metal wire is composed of a crosslinked epoxy resin. The outermost layer of the insulat ing covering layer is composed of a polyurethane. Either or both of a part of the tip end and side face of the metal electrode is directly covered with a polyurethane porous membrane instead of the insulating covering layer. The electrode is advantageous in that a the adhesion of a membrane to the insulating covering layer and the adhesion of the insulating covering layer to a metal wire of the electrode are excellent, b measurement can be stably performed for a long time, c a stabilization time required for obtaining a stable current value at the initial stage of the measurement is short, and d the electrode can be handled very easily and has enhanced measurement precision and response characteristics.
