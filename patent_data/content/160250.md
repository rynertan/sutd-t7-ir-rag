# MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY PANEL FOR EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY OF RENAL CARCINOMA

## Abstract
A panel of monoclonal antibodies is developed for use in diagnosis and treatment of renal carcinoma. One monoclon al antibody F₃₁ reacts with 80 of renal carcinoma. The area of overlap of reactivity of monoclonal antibodies F₃₁, F₂₃, S₄, S₂₃ and S₂₇ is the site of origin of most renal carcinomas. Reactivity with this panel of monoclonal antibodies localizes most renal carcionoma and is a vehicle for early diagnosis and treatment.
