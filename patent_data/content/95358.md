# Method of recovering metal values from superalloy scrap.

## Abstract
A method for recovering superalloy scrap is disclosed. The method involves oxidizing superalloy scrap in a aqueous acidic medium. The aqueous acidic medium has an oxidation potential sufficient to oxidize nonferrous additive superalloy elements to insoluble oxides thereof and to oxidize major superalloy constituents to aqueously soluble species where the chromium values are oxidized to the 3 valence. The insoluble solids from the aqueous solution are separated when the aqueous solution is extracted with an aqueously substantially insoluble tertiary amine to form an organic phase and an aqueous phase. The aqueous phase contains essentially nickel and chromium values. The chro mium 3 is oxidized to aqueous soluble chromium 6, the aqueous phase is deacidified to a pH of 7 10 with a soluble carbonate to form insoluble nickel carbonate, the nickel carbonate is precipitated from the chromium containing solution, nickel is recovered from the nickel carbonate precipitate, and chromium is recovered from the solution.
