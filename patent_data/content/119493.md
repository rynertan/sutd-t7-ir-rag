## Description
USE OF COPOLYMERS OF 2 ACRYLAMIDO 2 METHYLPROPANE SULFONIC ACID FOR IMPROVING RETENTION AND DEWATERING IN THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER Background of the InventionField of the Invention This invention relates to a process for improving retention of fillers and pulp fines and increasing rate of dewatering of furnish in the manufacture of paper, as well as to paper products of such process.Description of the Prior Art In the general practice of papermaking, an aqueous pulp suspension, or furnish , of cellulosic fibers resulting from pulping of the feed wood stock is hydraulically and mechanically conveyed onto a wire grid or screen which is in motion to produce a wet web of cellulosic fibers. The wet fiber web is dewatered on the screen, by drainage of liquid therefrom, following which the wet web may be further treated, dried, calendared, and subjected to additional treatments as desired. In general practice, a number of additives are contained in the furnish which is passed to the wire substrate wet web forming means. These additives may include processing aids for improving operation of the papermaking machinery, as well as paper chemicals for improvement of the properties of the finished paper product. Suitable processing aids may include retention aids for the retention of filler additives in and on the resultingly formed web and reduction of loss of paper pulp fines from the furnish during the dewatering step and drainage aids for improving the rate of dewatering of the furnish on the wire forming means. Other additives may include formation aids, flocculants, defoamers, wet web strength additives, pitch control agents, slimicides, creping aids, and the like, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Functional additives may include fillers as mentioned, sizing aids and the like The fillers may include optical brighteners, opacifiers, and pigments. Sizing agents are employed to provide the paper product with resistance to wetting by liquids, such as ink, water and the like, and rosin or waxes are typically employed for such purpose. Based on considerations of efficiency and ease of processing, it is desirable to add retention aids to the furnish prior to the wet web formation step, to neutralize or reduce negatives surface charges inherently present on cellulosic fibers and fines and to cause coflocculation of fillers, fibers and fines so that they cohere, in addition to being bonded by the retention agent. A number of retention aids have been employed in prior art, generally containing amine or quarternary ammonium groups, such as diethylenetriamine adipic acid polyamide treated with epichlorohydrin, polymers of ethylenimine and dimethyldiallylammonium chloride, and aminoethyl acrylates copolymers. Also employed in the prior art is hydrated aluminum sulfate, i.e., alum, used both singly and in combination with other retention aids. Also heretofore employed are various polymers and copolymers of acrylamide, of ionic and nonionic types. In particular, polyacrylamides of cationic and anionic type have been employed in combination with alum.Although combinations of retention aids have been employed to provide high levels of filler retention, such as by addition of a low molecular weight cationic polymer to the furnish followed by a high molecular weight anionic polymer, such combinations can deleteriously affect web formation by promoting excessive flocculation of the cellulosic fibers, which must be compensated for by agitative treatment of the furnish upstream of the wet web formation step in the papermaking process. Similarly, numerous drainage aids have been employed in papermaking to provide increased capacity for processing rate in the papermaking process in systems where dewatering or liquid drainage is the rate limiting step in the process. Although it is generally desirable to maximize retention and drainage rates in the papermaking system, the additives which heretofore have been employed for such purpose frequently deleteriously co act with one another to reduce their effectiveness, due to the opposed character of the operations of drainage and enhancement of retention. Further, many drainage and retention aids heretofore employed are characterized by low levels of activity at lower pH. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved process and composition for enhancing retention and rate of dewatering of furnish in the manufacture of paper. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one aspect, this invention relates to an additive composition for improving retention of fillers and pulp fines and increasing rate of dewatering of furnish in the manufacture of paper, comprising a a water soluble copolymer containing from about 2.5 to about 35 mole percent repeating units derived from 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid, and b a water soluble polymer selected from the group consisting of polyacrylamide, and copolymers containing from about 70 to about 100 mole percent of repeating units derived from acrylamide wherein the weight ratio of a to b is from about 8 1 to about 0.125 1. In another aspect of the invention, there is provided an improved process for enhancing retention of fillers and pulp fines and increasing rate of dewatering of furnish in the manufacture of paper, comprising adding to said furnish prior to the dewatering thereof a from about 0.1 to about 3.0 pounds per ton of said furnish of a water soluble copolymer containing from about 2.5 to about 35 mole percent repeating units derived from 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid, and b from about0.1 to about5.0 pounds per ton of said furnish of a water soluble polymer selected from the group consisting of polyacrylamide, and copolymers containing from about 70 to about 100 mole percent of repeating units derived from acrylamide. The invention also relates to a paper product of the process as described in the preceding paragraph. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In connection with the present invention, it has surprisingly and unexpectedly been discovered that the use in combination of a water soluble copolymer containing from about 2.5 to about 35 mole percent of repeating units derived from 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid hereinafter denoted as AMPS and a water soluble polymer selected from the group consisting of polyacrylamide, and copolymers containing from about 70 to about 100 mole percent of repeating units derived from acrylamide react synergistically in providing higher levels of retention and rate of dewatering drainage rate than is achievable with either component when used alone.Furthermore, in contrast to prior art combination drainage retention aid additives, the composition of the present invention is relatively insensitive to pH and is highly effective in both acid and alkaline systems. AlthoughAMPS polymers and copolymers have been taught as drainage and retention aids in the prior art, e.g., German Offenlegungsschrift 2,248,752, there has been no recognition that such additives could be used in combination with acrylamide polymers or copolymers in the manner of the present invention, to achieve the enhanced drainage and retention performance levels economically achieved by the composition of the instant invention. The composition and process of the present invention may be applied with advantage to furnishes of diverse papermaking stock, such as groundwood, thermal mechanical processing TMP pulps, kraft feedstocks and the like, and is particularly efficacious in application to newsprint furnishes containing at least 40 percent by weight of groundwood pulp. The AMPS copolymer employed in the present invention contains from about 2.5 to about 35, preferably 5 20 and most preferably from 7 15 mole percent repeating units derived from AMPS. As used herein, AMPS is intended broadly to refer to 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid as well as and any suitable salts thereof. Suitable AMPS copolymers include those containing for example from about 65 to about 97.5 mole percent of repeating units derived from acrylamide, and from about 3 to about 15 mole percent of repeating units derived from acrylic acid. Preferably, the AMPS copolymer has a molecular weight of from about 2 million to about 20 million. Particularly preferred copolymers may for example have a Standard Brookfield viscosity, measured in a 0.20 solution at 250C in 0.33 M NaCI with a num 1 spindle rotating at 60 rpm, of 2 10 centipoises. The polymeric co additive employed with the AMPS copolymer is a water soluble polymer selected from the group consisting of polyacrylamide, and copolymers containing from about 70 to about 100 mole percent of repeating units derived from acrylamide. This polymer may be nonionic or ionic in character and is most preferably cationic. Suitably, this polymer may be a cationic emulsion copolymer containing a 95 mole percent repeating units derived from acrylamide and 5 mole percent repeating units derived from dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate which is quaternized with dimethyl sulfate, the copolymer being emulsified with sorbitan monooleate and containing a suitable emulsin breaker.Alternatively, this polymer may be a cationic copolymer of acrylamide and diallyldimethylammonium chloride containing 75 to 99 mole percent repeating units derived from acrylamide and having a molecular weight of less than about 25,000. Other suitable polymers include aminomethylated polyacrylamide and methacrylamidopropyl trimethylammonium chloride acryamide copolymers. In the process of the invention, from about 0.1 to about 3.0 pounds per ton of the Furnish of the AMPS copolymer is added, together with from about 0.1 to about 5.0 pounds per ton of the acrylamide polymer or copolymer, preferably from about 0.5 to about 2.0 pounds per ton of theAMPS copolymer and from about 0.5 to about 2.0 pounds of the acrylamide polymer or copolymer. Advantageously, the weight ratio of the AMPS copolymer to the acrylamide polymer or copolymer added to the furnish is in the range of from about 0.125 1 to about 8 1. Although, as mentioned, the invention has broad utility in acidic and alkaline furnish media, the composition of the invention is particularly effective at a pH in the range of from about 4.0 to about 5.5. The composition of the invention may be used, for example, in a furnish containing a rosin size and alum at pH levels below about 5. Further, the composition of the instant claimed invention may be employed with conventional retention and drainage aid promoter compounds, such as diallyldimethylammonium chloride polymers or copolymers and polyethyleneimine. The following specific examples illustrate specific aspects of the present invention. These examples are set forth by way of illustration only and are not to be construed as limiting on the scope of the present invention except as set forth in the appended claims. In all examples set forth hereinafter parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLE I The tests described hereinafter were conducted on newsprint furnishes having the compositions shown in Table I below. TABLE I Newsprint Furnish Stock CharacteristicsStock Consistency Mobility CDHeadbox 1.62 0.45 37Kraft 3.82 1.61 10.1TMP 4.08 1.28 39.7Groundwood 3.77 1.12 54.5 The tabulated values for consistency were measured by filtering a weighed stock sample, then drying the retained fiber and weighing same. Mobility was measured in units of microns second volts centimeter at the stationary layer in a microelectrophoresis cell. The values set forth for CD represent the cationic demand for the furnish, measured as the dosage, in lbs. ton of furnish, of poly dimethylamino epichlorohydrin necessary to reduce the mobility of the furnish sample to zero. Headbox samples of the newsprint furnish described in Table I were obtained from a twin wire papermaking machine, which normally has low first pass retention FPR .The first pass retention for the machine is defined as follows Headbox Consistency Tray Consistency x 100 , FPR Headbox Consistency and thus is a measure of the efficiency of the forming section of the papermaking machine in removing suspended material in the headbox furnish i.e., fibers, fines and fillers from the stock. High first pass retention correlates with low recirculation rates of fines and fillers in the papermaking system and better operation of the wet end of the process. A Britt jar was used in the following tests to measure the effect of various additives on first pass retention. Conditions of operation speed of agitation and serum size were selected so that the FPR obtained with theBritt jar was the same as the FPR measured on the papermaking machine. The furnish for which the Britt jar was calibrated then was treated with the selected amount of furnish additive and FPR measured again in the Britt jar. Drainage measurements were. made in a drainage tube, based on the amount volume of filtrate collected in a period of 5 seconds. In the following Table, samples denoted as Blank contained no polymeric additives for enhancement of reten tion and or drainage. The remaining samples contained specified amounts of Polymer M and or Copolymer A. PolymerM is a cationic emulsion copolymer containing 95 mole percent repeating units derived from acrylamide and 5 mole percent repeating units derived from dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate which is quaternized with dimethylsulfate, the copolymer being emulsified with sorbitan monooleate Arlacel 80, AtlasDivision of ICI Americas, Inc. and Alfonic 1412 60 ConocoChemicals Company emulsion breaker. Copolymer A is a copolymer according to the present invention containing twenty mole percent repeating units derived from AMPS and eighty mole percent repeating units derived from acrylamide. Britt jar first pass retention values and drainage tube drainage measurements are set forth in Table II below.

The results shown in Table II indicate that copolymer A was superior to Polymer M in the provision of high retention and drainage rates and that the combination ofPolymer M and Copolymer A provided a surprising and marked improvement in retention and drainage relative to either additive alone, when considered on the basis of equivalent total additive weight. For example, the combination of 1.9 pounds per ton of Polymer M with 1.1 pounds per ton ofCopolymer A gave a retention value of 63.4 percent, while three pounds per ton of Polymer M provided a retention value of only 42.2 percent likewise, the use of four pounds per ton of Polymer M in combination with 2.2 pounds per ton ofCopolymer A provided a retention level of 81.2 percent, as contrasted to 6.8 pounds per ton of Polymer M, which yielded a first pass retention value of 62 percent.Concerning the retention data, the combination of Polymer M, at 2.1 pounds per ton, with Copolymer A, at 1.14 pounds per ton, yielded a drainage rate of 16 milliliters for the five second drainage period, while 3.2 pounds per ton of Polymer M gave a drainage rate of only 9 millimeters for the five second period.Relative to Copolymer A alone, which had a concentration of 1.7 pounds per ton yielded a drainage rate of 10 milliliters, an equivalent weight of Polymer M 1.1 pounds per ton andCopolymer A 0.57 pounds per ton gave a drainage rate of 12 milliliters per five second drainage period, an improvement of 20 percent. EXAMPLE 2 The tests described below were carried out to determine retention values for various furnishes, including combinations of Copolymer A with various co additive polymers in varying molar ratios. Copolymer A and Polymer M were again each run separately against a control furnish containing no additives, along with furnishes of the following compositions Copolymer A in combination with Polymer M, at weight ratios of M A of 2 1 and 1.24 1 Copolymer A in combination with a cationic polyacrylamide which has beenManniched to a 70 level by reaction with formaldehyde and dimethylamine, hereinafter referred to as Polymer N, at a weight ratio of N A of 10 1 Copolymer A in combination with an anionic, acrylamide and acrylic acid copolymer containingAlfonic 1412 60, hereinafter referred to as Polymer 0, in a weight ratio of 0 A of 1.24 1 Copolymer A in combination with a cationic copolymer of acrylamide and diallyldimethylammonium chloride containing 75 99 mole percent repeating units derived from acrylamide with a molecular weight of less than about 25,000, containing 25 glyoxal for cross linking of the polymer resin, hereinafter referred to as Polymer P, at a weight ratio of P A of 1.24 1 and Copolymer A in combination with a nonionic polyacrylamide containing three percent Alfonic 1412 60, hereinafter denoted as Polymer Q, at a weight ratio of Q A of 1.82 1. The furnish employed in this series of tests was a newsprint furnish having the following composition 45 weight bleached kraft and 55 weight percent groundwood.First pass retention was measured with a Britt jar for the additive compositions shown in Table III below, wherein the retention percentage values are tabulated. The twin wire papermaking machine for which the Britt jar was calibrated had a measured FPR value of 47.5 , which is high for newsprint due to the high amount of kraft in this furnish.

For example, two pounds per ton ofPolymer M alone provided a first pass retention level of 69.4 percent, whereas a combination of 1.14 pounds per ton ofPolymer M and 0.91 pounds per ton of Polymer A, representing approximately the same additive total weight, provided a retention level of 90.1 and 90.4.Likewise, two pounds per ton of Copolymer A yielded a retention level of 80.5 percent, while a combination of 1.14 pounds Polymer 0 per ton and 0.91 pounds Copolymer A per ton, gave a retention level of 88.4 percent, representing an increase of 10 for the O A combination relative to Copolymer A alone. The date also show that for Copolymer A alone, an increase in concentration ofCopolymer A over about 1.2 pounds per ton is detrimental and results in decreasing retention level with increased concentrations of such copolymer. EXAMPLE III In this example, the effect of ionic charge on theAMPS copolymer employed in the composition of the present invention was investigated using samples of dry polymer. In the evaluation, copolymers of AMPS and acrylamide were employed with varying concentrations of AMPS, in furnishes employing the copolymer alone and in combination with PolymerM as previously described, in the manner of the present invention. The furnish employed in these tests was the same as that employed in Example II, and first pass retention was evaluated by Britt jar test.

In addition, the respective copolymers were employed in combination withPolymer M, as previously described in Example I, at weight ratios of M Copolymer of 0.6 0.5 and 1.1 0.9. The retention values shown in Table IV clearly show the marked enhancement when the copolymer is used in combination with Polymer M, relative to the use of the copolymer alone. The data further show that there is an optimum with respect to percentage charge on the copolymer, at approximately 10 20 percent charge, corresponding compositionally to 10 20 percent AMPS in the copolymer. It is to be noted that above about 20 percent charge twenty percent AMPS , there is a decreasing level of retention with increased charge levels, both for the copolymer alone and for the copolymer in combination with Polymer M.

The 5 second drainage volume for the control sample containing no drainage retention additives was 22 milliliters. Each of the copolymer additives produced substantial increases in drainage, which was further increased by combination with Polymer M in the manner of the present invention. As shown, Polymer M alone produced only a small negative effect on the drainage rate relative to the control sample containing no additives. EXAMPLE V Retention studies were made on a furnish from the same papermaking machine as in Example II, samples of which incorporated various additives, denoted by the same designations as in the preceding examples. Additionally, the additive combinations included a 70 30 acrylamide acrylic acid copolymer containing Alfonic 1412 60, denoted herein asPolymer R a 16 weight percent aqueous solution of poly dialkyldimethyl ammonium chloride , herein designated as Polymer S.
