## Description
SURFACTANT COMPOSITION AND PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF OIL USING SUCH A COMPOSITION The invention relates to a surfactant copposition for use in the production of oil and to a process for the production of oil from an underground oil containing formation by injecting such a surfactant composition into said formation. The efficient recovery of oil fran an underground oilcontaining formation is of great importance. The production of oil frcm such a formation is commenced by reducing the pressure prevailing in the formation. However it has long been recognized that substantial amounts of oil remain in the formation after the pressure has decreased. To enhance the oil production it has been proposed to inject water, steam or gases like nitrogen, carbon dioxide, C1 C3 hydrocarbons, oxygen or air, into the formation. A very promising method for enhanced oil production comprises the injection of an aqueous surfactant containing solution. It is assumed that the surfactant lowers the interfacial tension between oil and water. The lowering of the interfacial tension is often related to the formation of a three phase system in the formation an oil phase, a microemulsion phase and an aqueous brine phase containing substantially no surfactant. The microemulsion phase is a thermoynamically stable phase containing both oil and water and surfactant. The interfacial tension between oil and the microemuision is considerably lower than the interfacial tension between oil and water or brine without surfactant. Due to this lower interfacial tension the oil can be driven out of the pores in the formation where the oil was left after the pressure decrease. The interfacial tension between the microemulsion phase and the aqueous brine phase is not very high, too, so that after having forced the oil out of the pores, the microemulsion in its turn is removed from the pores by the water. In this way the surfactant containing microemulsion is used throughout the whole formation. The formation of a three phase system is highly dependent on the salinity of the brine present in the formation, using a given surfactant or surfactant blend. By means of brine samples it is possible to determine the salinity and to adjust the surfactant containing solution such that in model experiments three phases are attained at the salinity found. However, upon passing a surfactant ccntaining solution through the formation the salinity may change, e.g. it is possible that salts from the formation dissolve in the injected solution, or that ion exchange occurs between cations in the solution and cations in the formation. It then may happen that the microesnulsion is no longer stable and disappears, so that oil production is considerably reduced. From the above it is evident that it is advantageous to apply a surfactant composition capable of creating a three phase system in a salinity range as wide as possible. The invention provides a surfactant composition capable of forming a three phase system aver a wide salinity range. The invention, therefore, relates to a surfactant compo sition for use in the production of oil from an oil containing underground formation, comprising an alcohol alkoxy acetate and an alkyl aryl sulphonate in the form of their salts in such quantities that the composition contains between 1 and 100 pbw of the alkyl aryl sulphonate per 100 pbw of the alcohol alkoxy acetate. The alcohol alkoxy acetate boosts the ccnpatibility of the surfactant ccmposition with saline water, whereas the alkyl aryl sulphonate favours the oil solubility. The relative quantities of both surfactants mentioned above can be varied between the limits given, as required by the salinity of the brine in the formation. Preferably, the ccm√ßo sition contains between 10 and 100 pbw of the alkyl aryl sulphonate per 100 pbw of the alcohol alkoxy acetate, thereby increasing the salinity range in which three phases occur. The surfactants in the composition are used and stored in the form of their salts, preferably their alkali metal, in particular sodium, salts. However use of the surfactant in the form of other salts, like the attrronium, alkylammonium or alkanolammonium salt, is also possible. Preferably, the alcohol moiety in the alcohol alkoxy acetate comprises 6 to 20 carbon atoms. The alcohol moiety does not only comprise aliphatic alcohols, but also alkylated phenols. Suitable alkoxy groups are ethoxy and 1, 2 propoxy, the ethoxy group being preferred. When the alcohol alkoxy acetate ccmprises ethoxy groups, the alcohol ethoxy acetate advantageously contains 1 to 30 ethoxy groups. So, according to the above preferred embodiments by alcohol alkoxy acetate compounds are understood which have the following general formula RO CH2C R HO HO nCH2 in which R is an alkyl group having 6 20 carbon atams, R is a hydrogen or methyl group, M is a cation, e.g. sodium or ammonium, and n is a number in the range fran 1 to 30. The alcohol ethoxy acetate is generally prepared via reaction of an alcohol ethoxylate with chloro acetic acid or by catalytic oxidation of an alcohol ethoxylate with oxygen in the presence of sodium hydroxide and a palladium containing catalyst. Suitable alkyl aryl sulphonates are those in which the aryl moiety ccmprises benzene, toluene or xylene. Preferred alkyl aryl sulphonates are C6C 20 alkyl xylene sulphonates. Even more preferred are latter sulphonates when derived from o xylene. The length of the alkyl chain can be varied in accordance with the requirements set by the formation. The alkyl aryl sulphonates are conveniently prepared by alkylation of benzene, toluene or xylene with an olefin, followed by sulphonation and neutralization. So, according to the above preferred embodiments by alkyl aryl sulphonate compounds are understood, having the following general formula EMI4.1 where m is 0, 1 or 2, R is a C6 C20 alkyl group and M is a cation, e.g. sodium or ammonium. Advantageously, the surfactant composition comprises, apart from water, an alcohol as cosolvent. The quantity of the alcohol usually ranges up to 100 pbw per 100 pbw of the alcohol alkoxy acetate. Amongst others, the purpose of the alcohol is to reduce the viscosity of the microemulsion. The alcohol also increases the rate at which the equilibrium between the phases is reached.The nature of the alcohol is suitably such that it substantially does not interfere with the phase behaviour of the surfactant composition, when this composition is contacted with oil and brine. Not only linear alcohols are suited. Branched alcohols, too, show a good performance. The use of glycol derivatives like mono alkyl ethers of mono , di or triethylene glycol or of mono , di , or tripropylene glycol is also possible. Preferably the alcohol comprises 2 to 9 carbon atams. In particular s butanol and the butyl ether of ethylene glycol are Preferred. The surfactant composition is preferably stored and trans ported in the form of a concentrate. Near the oil field where it is used the composition is diluted with water to produce an aqueous surfactant containing solution which solution is injected.During the dilution the salinity of the solution can be adjusted to the requirements of the formation. The term surfactant composition in the application does not only refer to a diluted aqueous solution but also to a concentrate. When the surfactant composition is stored or transported in a concentrated form, the alcohol alkoxy acetate and alkyl aryl sulphonate are typically present therein in a quantity of 60 w, calculated on the total composition. The balance of the composition is then water and optionally the alcohol. A concentrate of the surfactant composition is suitably prepared by mixing an aqueous solution containing at least 10 w of sodium hydroxide with a C 29 alcohol and by neutralizing an alkyl aryl sulphonic acid with the mixture obtained and subsequently by adding an alcohol alkoxy acetate to the composition formed. A preferred process for the preparation of such a surfactant composition comprises mixing an aqueous solution containing at least 10 w of a neutralizing agent with a C2 Cg alcohol and by adding to this mixture an alcohol alkoxy acetic acid and subsequently an alkyl aryl suiphonic acid. As already indicated above, suitable C2 Cg 29 alcohols are s butanol and butyl ether of ethylene glycol. The neutralizing agent may conveniently be an ammonium or, preferably, an alkali metal hydroxide. Sodium hydroxide has been found to be very satisfactory. The invention also relates to a process for the production of oil from an oil containing underground formation by injecting a surfactant composition as defined above into said formation.The composition may suitably be used in well stimulation or in flooding processes. The invention will now further be elucidated with reference to the following Examples. EXAMPLE I In a number of experiments properties were determined of a system comprising a Far Eastern crude oil, a synthetic brine indicated as synthetic reservoir water, SFW and one or more surfactants. For each experiment a series of tests were run. In each test 1 meq surfactant was placed in a test tube. To the surfactant s 0.1 g of s butanol was added and the tube was filled with water and oil such that the volume ratio water to oil was 3 1. The total volume was 18 ml. In each tube water having a different salinity was applied. The synthetic reservoir water was made up of a NaCl andCaCl2 solution, the Na Ca molar ratio being 231. The salinity is expressed in percentage SRW, 100 SRW corresponding with 10.0 g l NaCl and 0.082 g l CaC12. The test tube thus filled was gently moved, placed into a thermostat and kept there until no changes in the volumes of the phases were abserved. By means of this procedure sometimes referred to as salinity scan it is possible to determine at which salinity a three phase system starts to occur, is present and stops to occur. The width of the salinity range in which a three phase system occurs is often called the salinity window SW and is generally expressed in SRW. The tests were run at two different temperatures, corresponding with potential formation temperatures. The following surfactants were used in the experiments Surfactant I was a sodium alcohol ethoxy acetate in which the alcohol moiety comprised for 42 mol. a linear C12 chain and for 58 mol. a linear C13 chain, whereas the average number of ethoxy groups per molecule was 4.5. Surfactant II was similar to Surfactant I but had an average number of 6 ethoxy groups per molecule. Surfactant III was a sodium alcohol ethoxy acetate with an average of 9 ethoxy groups per molecule. The alcohol moiety comprised linear chains with 12 20 mol. , 13 30 mol. , 14 30 mel. and 15 20 mel. carbon atoms. Surfactant IV was a sodium alkyl aryl sulphonate which was derived from o xylene and which consisted for 40 w of C8 C10 alkyl xylene sulphonate, for 35 w of Cll Cl2 alkyl xylene sulphonate and for 25 w of C13 C14 alkyl xylene sulphonate. The average molecular weight was 370. The alkyl aryl sulphonate is commercially available under the registered trade mark EnordetLXS 370 . The results of the experiments are summarized in Table I.

In these experiments a relatively wide salinity window is observed. It is shown that using only alcohol ethoxy acetate the surfactant does not form a stable three phase system cf. experiments 5, 6, 11, 12, 19 and 20 .Using more than 100 pbw of alkyl aryl sulphonate per 100 pbw of alcohol methoxy acetate the salinity window is becoming narrower cf. experiments 1, 2, 7, 8, 13 and 14 . EXAMPLE II A concentrate of the surfactant composition was prepared by mixing 32 g of secondary butanol with a sufficient quantity of aqueous sodium hydroxide concentration 46 w . To this mixture was added with stirring 50 g of the alcohol ethoxy carboxylic acid containing 85.3 w pure acids . To the resultant blend was added with stirring 23 g of an alkyl aryl sulphonic acid containing 94 w pure acids . The resulting concentrate was a clear golden, mobile liquid. A second concentrate was prepared in which the secondary butanol was replaced by the butyl ether of glycol. This concentrate was a clear, golden, mobile liquid. Composition and viscosity of the two concentrates is given in Table II.
