# MULTICHANNEL MAGNETIC HEAD AND MANUFACTURING METHOD THEREFOR

## Abstract
Disclosed is a multichannel magnetic head having magnetic circuits for respective channels, each positioned to traverse a magnetic flux to be detected, and a Hall element disposed in the magnetic circuits and used as magnetic electric converter. The Hall element 14 is an amorphous magnetic thin film which consists essentially of an alloy containing a rare earth element e.g. Gd and a transition metal e.g. Co . To the amorphous magnetic thin film 14 there are connected to a pair of current terminals 20, 22 and Hall voltage terminals 16₁ 16₄ . The Hall volt age terminals are provided in the same numbers as the annels or the magnetic circuits 7₁ 7₄ .
