# Radiation image reproducing method and apparatus.

## Abstract
In the radiation image recording and reproducing sys tem, a radiation image stored in a stimulable phosphor sheet at an n 1 th object image recording step is read out to obtain an electric image signal, and an electric image signal corresponding to radiation energy remaining in the stimul able phosphor sheet after an n th image recording step is subtracted from the electric image signal obtained after the n 1 th image recording step. A visible image only of the radiation image recorded at the n 1 th image recording step is reproduced on the basis of an electric image signal obtained by the subtraction.
