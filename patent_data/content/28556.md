# Hydraulic control valve.

## Abstract
Control valve in which the reaction torque is created firstly by hydraulic reaction means and secondly by resilient means to provide for a second gradient of reaction torque. The invention consists in a control valve having a star shaped rotor 20 rotatably mounted in a disc chamber of a stator to define notably with a constituting member 14 of that chamber several working chambers 25, 26 , the arms of said star shaped rotor 20 being of unequal lengthes to pro vide for a first gradient of reaction torque, as known per se, and the improvement consisting in that the member 14 is rotatable with respect to a surrounding intermediate member 2 of said stator and that resilient means 16 are located between members 14, 2 to provide for a second gradient of reaction torque. The invention concerns power steering of a vehicle.
