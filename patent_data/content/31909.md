## Description
3 OXOCYCLOPENTENES AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION The present invention relates to a process for producing 3 oxocyclopentenes. More particularly, it relates to a novel and improved process for preparing 3 oxocyclopentenes of the formula EMI1.1 wherein R1 is an alkyl group having not more than 6 carbon atoms e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, pentyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl , an alkenyl group having not more than 6 carbon atoms e.g.allyl, 2 cis pentenyl, 2 trans pentenyl, 4 pentenyl, 2,4cis pentadienyl , an alkynyl group having not more than 6 carbon atoms e.g. propargyl, 2 pentynyl or a group of the formula EMI1.2 wherein R2 is a hydrogen atom, a methyl group or a halogen atom e.g. chlorine, bromine, fluorine . The 3 oxocyclopentenes of the formula I are useful as intermediates for production of agricultural chemicals, medicines e.g. prostaglandin , perfumes e.g.jasmone , etc. For preparation of the 3 oxocyclopentenes I , there has been hitherto adopted a method comprising the following reaction G.

When, for instance, it represents phenyl, 2 thienyl or p tolyl, the 3oxocyclopentene B is readily obtainable in a good yield within a short reaction time.When, for instance, it represents lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, benzyl or substituted benzyl, a long reaction time is required, and yet the yield of the objective 3 oxocyclopentene B is extremely low. As the result of an extensive study, it has now been unexpectedly found that the treatment of the furancarbinol A in an aqueous medium within a certain specific pH range can afford the corresponding 3 oxocyclopentene B in a good yield within a short reaction time even when the furan carbinol A is of the kind to which the said known method could be hardly applied. According to the present invention, there is provided a process for preparing the 3 oxocyclopentenes I from the corresponding furan carbinols of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R1 is as defined above, characterized in that the latter is treated in an aqueous medium at a pH of 3 to 6.5. The characteristic feature of the process of this invention resides in that the treatment is effected in an aqueous medium at a pH of 3 to 6.5. As the aqueous medium, there may be used water alone or water containing a small proportion of any organic solvent e.g benzene, toluene, xylene, diisopropyl ether, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethylene glycol . The amount of the aqueous medium to be used may be usually from 0.5 to200 parts by weight, preferably from 5 to 100 parts by weight, to one part by weight of the starting furan carbinol II . The pH value of the reaction system is required to be maintained between 3 and 6.5, preferably between 3 and 6, the most preferably between 3.5 and 5.8. In case of the pH value being higher than the said upper limit, the reaction rate becomes markedly small or slow. In case of the pH value being lower than the said lower limit, side reactions proceed so that the yield of by products is increased. As the acidic and or basic substance for regulation of the pH value, any usual acidic or basic substance may be employed.Examples of the acidic substance are inorganic acids e.g.sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid , organic acids e.g. acetic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid , acidic metal salts e.g. sodium. dihydrogenphosphate, sodium hydrogensulfite , acid ion exchange resins, etc. Examples of the basic substance are hydroxides of alkali metals e.g.sodium, potassium and alkaline earth metals e.g. calcium, barium , basic salts of said metals such as carbonates, bicarbonates and acetates, amines e.g. triethylamine, pyridine , basic ion exchange resins, etc. Buffer solutions containing these acidic or basic substances are also usable. The treatment in the process of this invention is usually carried out at a temperature of 20 to 1200 C, preferably of 80 to 1000C. On the treatment, a metal salt, a surfactant or aquaternary ammonium salt may be incorporated into the reaction system for the purpose of shortening the reaction time, enhancing the yield, improving the volume efficiency, etc.Examples of the metal salt are magnesium salts e.g.magnesium chloride, magnesium bromide, magnesium sulfate, magnesium nitrate, magnesium acetate , manganese salts e.g.manganese chloride, manganese nitrate , copper salts e.g.copper sulfate, copper acetate , zinc salts e.g. zinc chloride , cobalt salts, iron salts, nickel salts, etc. The amount of the metal salt is usually from 0.001 to 0.2 mol, preferably from 0.01 to 0.05 mol, to 1 mol of the furancarbinol II . As the surfactant, any of cationic, nonionic and amphoionic ones may be employed. The amount of the surfactant is usually from 0.1 to 20 by weight, preferably from 1 to 5 by weight on the weight of the furan carbinol II . Examples of the quaternary ammonium salt are tetrabutylammonium bromide, benzyltrimethylammonium chloride, tricaprylmethylammonium chloride, dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride, caprylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride, etc. Its amount may be from 0.001 to 5 parts by weight to one part by weight of the furan carbinol II . Practically, the treatment of this invention may be carried out by dissolving or suspending the furancarbinol II into an aqueous medium containing or not any of a metal salt, a surfactant and a quaternary ammonium salt, elevating the temperature to a preferred one and making the proceeding of the reaction while controlling the pH value between 3 and 6.5. When the production amount of the 3 oxocyclopentene I reaches the maximum, the reaction is finished. Still, the starting furan carbinol II may be prepared, for instance, by the reaction of 5 methylfurfural with a Grignard s reagent of the formula R1MX wherein R1 is as defined above, M is Mg, Zn or Al2 3 and X is a halogen atom.
