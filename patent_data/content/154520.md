# RELEASABLE SPEAR FOR RETRIEVING TUBULAR MEMBERS FROM A WELL BORE

## Abstract
A releasable spear for retrieving tubular members from a well bore has a top member 1 connencted to a mandrel 2 which in turn is connected to a lower member 3 , the remote end of the member 3 from the mandrel 2 being adapted to secure a cutter not shown . Rotatably and longitudinally slidably disposed about the mandrel 2 is a sleeve 4 having a tapered portion 45 which is arranged to mate with and slidably cooperate with a corresponding taper 51 on the inside diameter of a grapple carrier 5 having grapples 50 . In a non expanded position of the grapples 50 the grapple carrier 5 is located on wedges 7 but upon rotation of the sleeve 4 by a dog clutch 60, 61 so the wedges 7 locate within a longitudinal keyway 8 of the grapple carrier and the grapple carrier 5 slides downwardly over the keys thereby radially expanding the grapples. By increasing the tension on the drilling string so the radially outward pressure of the grapples 50 upon the internal surfaces of the tubular member to be machined is increased. Whilst maintaining the drilling string in tension fluid is pumped through internal passages 10, 22, 36 of the members 1, 3 and mandrel 2 to radially extend the cutter and the spear may then be rotated to sever the tubular member whilst the drilling string is in tension. In another embodiment, instead of grapples an external screw thread 401 is provided on a sleeve 400 to suit a thread on the well head to be cut. In a further embodiment, again instead of using grapples a two part sleeve 421, 422 is provided with a cam 440 and radially expandable pins 430 which are driven outwardly by rotation of the cam to engage with the internal surface of a tubular member to be cut.
