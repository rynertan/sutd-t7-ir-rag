# Cold rolled steel suitable for enamel coating and method for making.

## Abstract
A cold rolled steel sheet suitable for enamel coating, which essentially consists of, on a weight basis, C up to 0.005 , P up to 0.02 , S up to 0.03 , N 0.005 to 0.012 , Ti up to 0.15 and Ti ⁴⁸ ₁₂C ⁴⁸ ₃₂S , Cu up to 0.08 , and at least one member selected from As, Sb, and Bi in a total amount of 0.003 to 0.03 , or Se and or Te in a total amount of 0.003 to 0.05 , or their combination in a total amount of 0.002 to 0.05 , the balance being Fe and concomitant impurities. The steel is made by continuously casting a molten steel having the above mentioned composition, hot rolling and then cold rolling the steel, and either continuously annealing or box annealing the steel at a temperature in the range from the recrystallization temperature to the Ac₃ point.
