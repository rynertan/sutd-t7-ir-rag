# Synthetic resin pen nib.

## Abstract
Thermoplastic synthetic resin pen nib is disclosed, which may suitably be employed in writing instruments for fine lettering or for drawing fine lines. The pen nib is formed of thermoplastic crystalline synthetic resin, e.g. polyethylene terephthalate resin, whose molecules are in a specific mixed crystallization structure obtained by controlling the crystalli zation. This structure consists essentially of molecularly oriented crystals, non oriented fine crystals dispersed and grown between the oriented crystals, and remaining amorphous regions, and provides the pen nib with highly improved physical and chemical properties.
