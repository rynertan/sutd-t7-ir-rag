# Transmission control system.

## Abstract
An electro hydraulic control system is intended for the kind of automatic power transmission which comprises at least three forward gear ratios and in which ratio changes are effected under power by releasing one clutch interconnecting the transmission input and output through one engaged gearset simultaneously with engaging another clutch interconnecting the input and output through another engaged gearset. The control system comprises hyd raulic gear actuators GA1,GA2,GA3 each for engaging and disengaging a separate gearset. Electro hydraulic valves A,B control the supply of hydraulic fluid to the actuators in response to ratio selection signals derived in an electronic control EC . One set of electro hydraulic valve states A 1, B 0 is arranged to engage first and second gearsets while a second set of electro hydraulic valve states A 1,B 1 is arranged to engage both second and third gearsets. Opera tion of the transmission in only one of the ratios associated with the two engaged gearsets is effected by holding one of the clutches 13 or 14 disengaged while the other clutch 14 or 13 respectively is engaged, thus establishing drive through one and only one of the two engaged gearsets.
