## Description
SPECIFICATIONMETHOD OF PREDICTING DURABILITY OF COATED METALLIC MATERIALTechnical Field This invention relates to a method of predicting the durability of coated metallic materials with respect to their properties selected in accordance with their application purposes and external conditions in service, by obtaining approximate equations representingchanges of the selected properties with the passage of time from correlation between results of short term practical exposure tests and those of artificial accelerated weathering tests.Background Art Coated metallic materials produced by applying coatings onto the surface of cold rolled steel sheets, molten galvanized steel sheets, electro galvanized steel sheets, molten aluminized steel sheets, etc.are used in many cases for a variety of applications such as interior or exterior building material, equipment and vehicle applications. Recently, even coated stainless steel has been developed as roofings.When the coated steel sheets are used as exterior building materials, the deterioration rate of the coating film and the corrosion rate of the steel sheet will vary depending upon external conditions during their use for example, meteorological conditions such as amounts of solar radiation, sunshine duration, air temperature, humidity and rainfall duration, and environmental factors such as sulfurous acid gas, marine salt particles, various kinds of dust and pollutants.Accordingly, in the artificial accelerated weathering tests to be conducted under simply set conditions, such as Sunshine Weather O Meter tests and salt water spray tests, it is impossible to reproduce deteriorated forms of the coated steel sheets in perfect agreement with those under actual use conditions, and further no consideration is given in these tests to the fact that the deterioration rate varies depending upon external use conditions. Further, in conventional tests for predicting the durability of the coated metallic material, the deterioration state of the coating film has been evaluated by observing chiefly changes in its appearance, such as decrease in gloss, discoloration, stain, chalking, blistering, peeling, cracking and rusting.However, the conventional tests are disadvantageous in that changes with lapse of time in important factors relevant to the durability cannot be estimated quantitatively, including for example, reduction in adhesion between the coating film and the metallic substrate material. Thus, it has been strongly required to develop a method by which the durability of the coated metallic materials can be predicted with high accuracy, with reflection of differences in their application purposes and external use conditions, by short term tests.Disclosure of Invention The inventors, as a result of various studies on such prediction method, have found that although the change quantity of measured value per hour lapsed varies, even with respect to the same property of the coated metallic material, depending upon the kind of the artificial accelerated weathering test method adopted, the measured values obtained in a different plurality of artificial accelerated weathering tests can be plotted substantially on the extension of the data obtained.in the practical exposure test in such a manner that for every artificial accelerated weathering test method, the number of test hours is converted to the number of years and plotted with the same ratio as that of the number of exposure years for the practical exposure test to the number of test hours for the artificial accelerated weathering test, both of which tests give substantially the same measured value. Also, it has been found that for the purpose of predicting more exactly the durability of the coated metallic material during the practical use, it is desired to conduct at least four types of artificial accelerated weathering tests to provide various external conditions. Further, it has been found that relation between the number of years lapsed and change in the properties obtained by plotting the data of the artificial accelerated weathering test nearly on the extension of the data of the practical exposure test is in good agreement with that between the number of years lapsed and change in the properties in case of actual use of the coated metallic material under the external conditions in the practical exposure test.This invention is accomplished on the basis of the findings. The object of this invention is to provide a method of predicting, with high accuracy, the durability of coated metallic materials with reflection of differences in their uses and external use conditions, by short term tests. That is, this invention relates to a method of predicting the durability of a coated metallic material with respect to its properties selected according to its application purposes and external conditions during its use, in which a practical exposure test for a short period of time but not less than two years is carried out along with at least one artificial accelerated weathering test per each of artificial accelerated weathering tests of mild type, accelerated corrosion type, heat acceleration type and ultraviolet irradiation type data obtained in the practical exposure test are plotted on a coordinate system with the number of exposure years as the x coordinate axis and the change value in the property of prediction object as the y coordinate axis to depict a temporary prediction line data obtained in each artificial accelerated weathering test which are within the range of the change values obtained in said practical exposure test are then plotted in the coordinate system wherein the temporary prediction line is depicted, so as to be positioned on said temporary prediction line or uniformly dispersed in the vicinity of the line while converting the test hours in each artificial accelerated weathering test to the number of test years in the practical exposure test with relation of direct proportion the change values obtained in the artificial accelerated weathering tests which are outside the range of the change values obtained in the practical exposure test are further plotted in said coordinate system the approximate equation y f x representing the whole plot thus obtained is determined, in which equation y represents the change value and x represents the number of years and the durability of the coated metallic material is predicted from the degree of deterioration in the selected property after given years obtained from the approximate equation. Brief Description of the Drawings Each drawing shows plots of the test data for each evaluation item in Example 7 obtained in accordance with the number of test years as well as line for the approximate equation derived from the plots.

Mode for Carrying Out the Invention The coated metallic material herein used means a metallic material coated with a paint, and the metallic material means metallic materials which can be coated, including steel sheets such as cold rolled steel sheets, molten galvanized steel sheets, electrogalvanized steel sheets, molten aluminized steel sheets and stainless steel sheets structural steels such as angle steel and wide flange beam steel and others such as aluminum sheets. Properties of these coated metallic materials differ in the rate of their deterioration or in their importance, depending upon uses of the materials such as building applications for walls, structural materials, etc. or interior applications for furnitures, office appliances, etc. and also upon external conditions during use as in outdoor use or indoor use. In predicting the durability of the coated metallic materials, it is not always necessary to measure all properties of the coated metallic materials such as corrosion resistance, gloss, color, viscoelasticity of the coating film,waterproofness of the coating film, adhesion between the coating film and metallic substrate material, and chemical change of the filmforming resins, it is preferable to predict their durability regarding the properties selected according to their application purposes and external conditions during use.However, as regards some coated metallic materials used for building materials, particularly, outside walls, almost all the properties are important.Therefore, it is desirable to preestimate as many properties thereof as possible and predict the durability of the coated metallic material as a whole. In the method of predicting the durability according to this invention, a practical exposure test is made in the first place. The practical exposure test is conducted at a place where the surrounding conditions are nearly equal to those under which the coated metallic material to be predicted will be used.This test is carried out at least for two years. The reason for this is that substantially no problem arises empirically in the durability of the coated metallic materials within two or three years and accordingly the prediction of the durability is directed to the durability at least for three years or longer, usually 5 20 years. The practical exposure test for less than two years results in lower accuracy of the prediction. When the term of prediction is longer, longer duration of the practical exposure test is necessary for higher accuracy of the prediction. On the other hand, artificial accelerated weathering tests are conducted. For the artificial accelerated weathering tests, various methods have been developed and put into practical use until now.Each of these methods does not reproduce natural surrounding conditions as such but has distinct features in the test conditions. Accordingly, selection and conduction of any one or two of these test methods will give one sided data. In this invention, at least one artificial accelerated weathering test per each of at least four specific types of artificial accelerated weathering tests are carried out in order to obtain overall data under the conditions as close to natural surrounding conditions as possible.The following are these four types of artificial accelerated weathering tests and test names abbreviations are shown in parentheses already known as examples of the artificial accelerated weathering tests i Mild type Xenon Fade O Meter test X.F.M. Sunshine Weather O Meter test S.W.M. ii Accelerated corrosion type Composite cyclic test combining an ultraviolet irradiation test and a corrosion test M.C.T. The well known salt spray test is used as one test constituting M.C.T. iii Heat accelerated type EMMAQUA test E.M.Q. High temperature Sunshine Weather O Meter test H.S.W.M. Heat test H.T. iv Ultraviolet irradiation type Qw test Q.U.V. Dew cycle Weather O Meter test D.W.M. Ultraviolet Fade O Meter test U.F.M. The duration for which the artificial accelerated weathering tests are to be conducted may be appropriately determined for each of the tests in consideration of the number of years for which the prediction is made, since the deterioration rate of the material varies depending upon the method of artificial accelerated weathering test used. In the actual exposure test and the artificial accelerated weathering test, sampling of the material is conducted as the time proceeds and in accordance with progress of the test, and evaluation items indicating changes in selected properties are measured.These evaluation items may include, for example, gloss retention for the gloss, color difference for the color, surface hardness for the visco elasticity of coating film, boiling water absorption factor for the waterproofness of coating film, and bond strength for the adhesion between coating film and metallic substrate material. Further, evaluation items indicating the degree of chemical change in the coating film that basically relates to change in the above mentioned properties may include, for example, oxidation, decomposition and loss of the coating film forming resin, and for the coating film using a plasticizer, the remaining amount of the plasticizer. Among those evaluation items, proper items may be determined with respect to the film forming resin of the coated metallic material to be predicted.Concrete methods used for measuring such evaluation items may be wellknown ones, examples of which will be given in theExamples. The data of each test obtained in the manner as mentioned in the foregoing are treated for each property of the coated metallic material to be predicted, as follows In the first place, the data of the practical exposure test are plotted on a coordinate system with the number of years as the x coordinate axis and with the measured value of the evaluation item indicating change in each property to be predicted this measured value in this invention is referred to as change value, including measured value in the artificial accelerated weathering tests as the y coordinate to depict a temporary prediction line. At least three points are desirably plotted for depicting the temporary prediction line.Secondly, the data of the artificial accelerated weathering tests are treated for each test as follows Among the change values, those falling within the range of change values of the practical exposure test are selected such values are usually obtained in the early stage of the artificial accelerated weathering tests and plotted on the coordinate system in which the temporary prediction line is depicted, so as to be positioned on the temporary prediction line or uniformly dispersed in the vicinity thereof while converting the test hours in the artificial accelerated weathering test to the number of years in the practical exposure test so as to hold a direct proportional relation. In other words, the change values of data in each artificial accelerated weathering test are taken as such on the y axis, and the x axis scale the number of years is graduated so that a constant proportion may be provided between the distance from the origin and the test time in the artificial accelerated weathering test and x, y plots may be positioned on the temporary prediction line as far as possible. Therefore, when only one datum is obtained in the artificial accelerated weathering test, it may be merely plotted at the position of the change value on the temporary prediction line. However, when two or more data are obtained, the relation on the x axis between those points of the data should be in conformity with the above requirements.Thus, with respect to each plot of the data obtained in the accelerated weathering test, there is a definite direct proportional relation between the number of years in the practical exposure test read on the x axis and the original test hours in the artificial accelerated weathering test, hereinafter, this definite ratio is referred to as practical exposure year conversion factor . While a scale with equal distances is usually used for the coordinate systems, it is unobjectionable depending upon the state of the change with lapse of time to use other scales, for example, logarithmic scales, etc.Of the data of each artificial accelerated weathering test, the change values out of the range of change values of the practical exposure test are plotted on the coordinate system similarly to the above, with the number of test hours converted into the number of years by means of the practical exposure year conversion factor. This data treatment is applied to each artificial accelerated weathering test. Thus, all data of the practical exposure test and artificial accelerated weathering tests are plotted on the coordinate system, thereby showing the entire aspect of change in change values which has some degree of dispersion. Then, the approximate equation y f x representing the whole plot obtained in the manner as mentioned above is determined by statistical calculation, in which equation y represents the change value and x represents the number of years. The approximate equation may be determined in such a manner that a line is drawn with eye measure on the coordinate system in which the data are plotted.However, as a result of extensive tests, the present inventors have revealed that either of the following fundamental equations is established between the change value y and the number of years x , with the correlation at a high significance level y a x b .... 1 y c e dx .... 2 wherein a and d are coefficients which are dependent upon the composition of the coating film, and b and c are coefficients which are dependent upon the evaluation item. Evaluation items obeying equation 1 may include, for example color difference and hardness and in case of forming the coating film from polyester resin, melamine resin or the like, oxidation of the resin, decomposition of the resin and loss in the amount of the resin. Those obeying equation 2 may include, for example gloss retention, boiling water absorption factor, bond strength for the substrate metallic material, remaining amount of plasticizer, amount of vinyl chloride resin soluble in tetrahydrofuran THF , and amount of chlorine liberated from vinyl chloride resin.Accordingly, the approximate equation can be determined by calculating a and b, or c and d, for the above cited evaluation items, by way of statistical calculation that x and y values of each plot are applied to the corresponding equation shown above, and for evaluation items other than the above cited ones, in such a manner that x and y values of each plot are statistically calculated and either equation 1 or 2 exhibiting higher significance level is adopted as the approximate equation. The determination of the approximate equation from data of the practical exposure test and artificial accelerated weathering tests is carried out on each property of the prediction object, coated metallic material. The approximate equation, y f x , thus obtained indicates approximately the state of the property changing with the passage of years. Consequently, the change value of the property in question after the predetermined number of years, i.e. deterioration degree of the property can be estimated by substituting the number of years for x to calculate y, or reading the same result on the drawing. Then, the durability of the coated metallic material can be predicted more completely by combining the degree of deterioration after given number of years with respect to all the properties selected. When the prediction is made on a number of properties, the calculation of the change value y after the given number of years x regarding each property or indication thereof on the prediction lines is not always convenient as such for the overall consideration because there are differences in the units of change values of the properties and in the changing states thereof. Thus, the change value at the time of start of the test that is, y value at x o is used as a standard. With respect to the measurement from indicating y o at x o, y value of another appropriate item relevant to such measurement item in point of the property in question is used as a standard. For example, when the measurement item is color difference, values of hE of L, a, and b systems according to the method of indicating color difference of JIS z8730 are determined, and the change thereof with lapse of time is depicted in a graph and standardized. And, change in the change values y of various properties with lapse of time is then depicted in the same drawing with a common scale ratio . This is convenient for combining the prediction values for various properties and judging the overall durability of the coated metallic material.The criterion of judging the durability of coated metallic material, i.e. definite criterion for judging what degree of change value y is the limit of working life, cannot be consistently determined since the properties of the material differ in the importance depending upon the application purposes and the position of a person to judge the durability of the material. It may be freely established from individual standpoint. Example 1 The surface of molten galvanized steel sheet deposition amount of the zinc on both surfaces 305 g m2 of 0.4 mm thickness was subjected to alkali defatting treatment and phosphate treatment and then coated with an epoxy type primer, which was baked to give a coating of 5 p after drying. A blue termosetting coating comprising a phthalic acid polyol condensation product and melamine resin as a crosslinking agent was applied onto the primer coating and baked to give a coating of 13 ij after drying. The coated steel sheet was tested in accordance with the procedure given below for the purpose of predicting the durability thereof in case of using it as an outside wall in Minami Bosd district, Japan, and approximate equation for prediction was obtained. Since the outside wall material is required to hold aesthetic appearance and anticorrosiveness for a long term, the prediction object properties, evaluation items and specific measuring methods are chosen as follows Prediction Evaluation Measuring object property Item method 1 Gloss Gloss 600 Mirror reflectivity retention in accordance with JIS Z8741 method of measuring glossiness AG Gt Go x 100 AG Gloss retension Gt Gloss after test Go Gloss before test 2 Color Color Color difference in L, difference a, and b systems in accordance with JIS Z8730 Method of indi cating color difference . 3 Visco Hardness Micro Vickers hardness elasticity of coating film surface of coating measured with a micro hardness meter Model N MM 2, mfd. by Taiyo Tester Co. 4 Water Bulling Boiling water absorp proofness water tion factor measured in of coating absorption aCCtdance with JIS t7209 test method for water absorption factor and boiling water absorption factor of plastics 5 Adhesion Bond Perpendicular peeling between strength test on an adhesive coating film Araldite 400 applied and substrate and cured Amsler universal tensile tester, Model RES 2 mfd. by Shimazu Corporation was used. 6 Chemical a Quantity Multiple reflection change of of resin method was used to film forming oxidized determine a ratio of I R resins b Loss of absorbance after test polyester at 3380 cm 1 OH group resin for a , at 1730 cm CO group for b , or c Quantity at 1630 cm 1 NH group of for c to that before melamine test FT IR spectrometer resin de Model FT 20B D mfd by composed Digilab Co. was used The practical exposure test was conducted inIchikawa City, Chiba prefecfure Japan for 5 years from March 1971 to March 1976. As the articifial accelrted weathering test, all the test methods 9 methods as previously explained with respect to t our types of tests were conducted. However 9 rement Of part of evaluation items was omitted in the other tests than the Sunshine WeatherO Meter test S.W.M. and the composite cyclic test M.C.T. . The high temperature Sunshine Weather OMeter test H.S.W.M. was carried out at 1000C. The composite cyclic test M.C.T. was conducted with one cycle of the test being composed of the dew cycleWeather O Meter test D.W.M. for 40 hours and the gas sulfurous acid corrosion test for 20 hours.The number of test hours in each artificial accelerated weathering test was as follows 8000 hours for S.W.M., 600 hours for M.C.T., one million Langlies in exposure quantity for E.M.Q., 1000 hours for H.S.W.M., 1000 hours for H.T., 3000 hours for Q.U.V., 9000 hours forX.F.M., 2000 hours for D.W.M., and 600 hours for U.F.M. The data obtained in the practical exposure test and the artificial accelerated weathering tests in which the sampling was conducted with lapse of time were treated as explained above and plotted in a drawing for each measurement item. Approximate equations regressive equations were obtained therefrom by statistical method. The results for the measurement items are shown in Figs. 1 to 8. Fig. 1 shows the results for gloss retention, Fig. 2 for color difference, Fig. 3 for hardness, Fig. 4 for boiling water absorption factor, Fig. 5 for bond strength, Fig. 6 for oxidation of the coating resin,Fig. 7 for loss of the polyester resin, and Fig. 8 for decomposition of the melamine resin. Symbols used in the Figures represent plots of the data obtained in the following artificial accelerated weathering tests ... practical exposure test o ... S. W. M. o ... D. W. M. ... X. F. M. A ... E. M. Q. A . . Q. U. y A ... H. S. W. M. o... U. F. M. ... M. C. T. ... H. T. 1000C From the approximate equations or the graphs thus obtained, the durability on each property of the coated metallic material can be predicted by obtaining the change value y corresponding to the given number of years x. Meanwhile, the above mentioned practical exposure test was further continued for 5 years, i.e.for 10 years in all, leaving the exposure conditions as they were. Measurements of the same evaluation items as mentioned above on these exposed specimens gave change values shown by the symbol in Figs. 1 to 8. From comparison of these values with the respective change values y at 10 years later estimated from the prediction lines in these drawings, it is seen that the durability of the coated metallic material of this type can be predicted with considerably high accuracy.Example 2 The surface of cold rolled steel sheet of 0.6 mm in thickness was subjected to alkali defatting treatment and phosphate treatment and then coated with a primer made of a mixture of acrylic resin and epoxy resin, which was baked to give a coating of 5 p in thickness after drying. A red vinyl chloride plastisol coating was applied on the primer coating and baked to give a coating of 200 p thickness after drying. The coated steel sheet was tested in accordance with the procedure given below for the purpose of predicting the durability of the sheet in case of using it as a roofing material in Miyazaki city,Miyazaki prefecture, Japan, and approximate equation for prediction of the durability was obtained. Since the roofing material is required, similarly to the outside wall material, to hold aesthetic appearance and anticorrosiveness for a long term, the prediction object properties, evaluation items and specific measuring methods chosen were substantially the same as in Example 1. However, in this example, a different film forming resin was used, and therefore the following evaluation items of chemical change of the resin and measuring methods thereof were selected. i Remaining amount of plasticizer and amount of vinyl chloride resin soluble in THF. Measuring method A liquid chromatograph Model PRP 1, mfd. by Shimazu Corporation is used with THF as the solvent and carrier. The specific peak after the test is divided by that before the test. ii Amount of chlorine liberated from vinyl chloride resin. Measuring method Geiger flex Goniometer Model KG X, mfd. by Rigaku Denki Co. is used, and a chromium target is used, Cl and Ti are analyzed, ratio of intensity of C1 Ka rays intensity of Ti Ka rays is determined, and further the ratio of this ratio after the test to the that before the test is obtained. The practical exposure test was conducted inMiyazaki city, Miyazaki prefecture for two years fromMarch 1976 to March 1978. The artificial accelerated weathering tests were conducted similarly to Example 1, but the total exposure time in each of the tests was as follows 10,000 hours for S.W.M., 1200 hours for M.C.T., two millions Langlies in exposure quantity for E.M.Q., 2000 hours for H.S.W.M., 2000 hours for H.T., 6000 hours for Q.U.V., 10,000 hours for X.F.t1., 4000 hours for D.W.M. and 5000 hours for U.F.M.Thereafter, the test data were treated in the same manner as in Example 1 and the following approximate equations for predicting the change values y were obtained for the respective evaluation items Unit of y Gloss retention y 96.8 e 0.149x Color difference y 0.80 x E Hardness y 0.07 x f.31 Hv Boiling water absorption factor y 3.02e 0.13x Wt Bond strength y 170.31e 0.08x kg cm 0.92x . y 1.05 eO.92xRemaining y 1.05 e 0.92x ratio in height amount of of peak after plasticizer test to that before test 0.94xAmount of vinyl y 1.14 e 0.94x ratio in height chloride resin of peak after soluble in THF test to that before test Amount of chlorine y 1.31 e0.O4x Amount of chlorine liberated from of X ray after vinyl chloride test to that resin before test Substitution of the given number of years for x in each equation shown above gives the corresponding change value y, and as a result the durability for each property can be predicted. By combining these results, the overall durability of the coated steel sheet can also be judged. The practical exposure test was further continued under the same conditions for 3 years to carry out the exposure test for 5 years in total. The y value obtained by substituting 5 forx in each approximate equation as shown above approximated to the change value for each measurement item obtained in the practical exposure test for 5 years to the same degree as in Example 1.Industrial Applicability According to this invention, changes in various properties of the coated metallic material can be predicted, with high accuracy, from approximate equations or prediction lines which are derived or depicted from series of plots obtained by partially overlapping the data of the practical exposure test with those of the artificial accelerated weathering tests conducted under the conditions corresponding to a variety of natural environmental conditions, in the drawing. Therefore, this invention is very valuable in industry.
