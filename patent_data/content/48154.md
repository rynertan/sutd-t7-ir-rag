# Resin composition for injection molding, method for producing the composition, and articles molded therefrom.

## Abstract
A resin composition suitable for injection molding and having excellent heat resistance, impact resistance and crack resistance, which is composed of a blend of polyphenylene ether resin and rubber reinforced styrene resin in which the amount of volatile material in the resin i.e. material having a molecular weight of about 300 or less is reduced to 5000 ppm or less. This resin composition is prepared by melting and kneading the two resins in an extruder with a vent, while keeping the vent part under reduced pressure. The addition of small amounts of water during the melting and kneading assists in reducing the amount of volatile materials to the desired level.
