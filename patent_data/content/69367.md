# Dither motor System.

## Abstract
A dither motor system is described for a ring laser angular rate sensor. Such a dither motor comprises a torquing means 225 acting upon the ring laser which forms part of a spring mass system 200 . Dithering serves to prevent the lock in effect. To control the peak amplitudes of rotation in response to a control signal TW sensing means 221 , pulsing means 410 , switch control means 420 and switching means 430 are arranged in a closed loop in order to supply the torquing means 225 with controlled energy.
