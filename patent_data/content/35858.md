# SHIP MANEUVERING GEAR

## Abstract
A ship maneuvering gear of a ship having two propellers each of which can be turned about a vertical axis perpendicu lar to a propeller shaft thereof, includes a hand lever HL that can be rotated about a vertical axis Z and can be inclined relative to the vertical axis Z , the rotation and the inclination of the hand lever HL being separately detected. An arithme tic circuit MC calculates a first quantity indicating a turn of the propellers proportional to the rotation of the hand lever HL , and second quantities indicating turns of the propellers to change the ship speed proportional to the inclination of the hand lever HL , and produces output signals to control the propellers by adding the first and second quantities.
