## Description
This invention relates to a bidirectional digital signal communication system and, more particularly, to a novel and highly effective bidirectional digital signal communication system especially adapted for use in transmitting a digital data signal through a CATV cable television transmission line and similar communication links. Fig. 1 schematically illustrates a bidirectional digital signal communication system representative of the prior art. A center unit 1 on the one hand and each of terminal units 2 on the other interchange a digital data signal through a transmission line or cable 3 of, for example, a CATV system. The network line from the center unit 1 to the terminal units 2 is referred to as a down link, while the network line from the terminal units 2 to the center unit 1 is referred to as an up link. A data signal to be transmitted through the down link generally has a frequency band higher than that of a data signal to be transmitted through the up link. For example, the down link data signal may have a frequency band of 50 MHz to 450 MHz, while the up link data signal may have a frequency band of 5 MHz to 30 MHz. Generally, in a bidirectional digital signal communication system, a digital information or data signal is transmitted from a center unit broadcasting station through a down transmission line down link to each terminal unit, and each terminal unit transmits a digital data signal through an up transmission line up link to the center unit. In the case of transmission through the up link, in order to prevent deterioration of the S N signal to noise ratio due to heat generated by a resistor in the last stage of the terminal unit, etc., the data signal and a pseudo noise PN code are multiplied with each other. This produces a so called spread spectrum encoding the data signal. The data multiplied by the PN code has a wide frequency spectrum so that it is less affected by noise during transmission than it would otherwise be. The data as encoded in the spread spectrum is transmitted in the form, for example, of a PSK modulated signal i.e., a signal modulated by phase shift keying . DE A 26 03 524 describes a bidirectional digital signal communication system according to that one described above, i. e. a system generating digital data spread with a PN code, however, only communication between a sender unit and a single terminal unit is described. The terminal unit preferably is arranged within a flying object. As the distance between the central unit and the terminal unit may change permanently, synchronization is performed permanently. EP A 0 037 299 mentions that it is generally known to perform synchronization either permanently or only when starting data transmission however, in the latter case, the synchronization may be repeated from time to time . When synchronization is not performed permanently, the value of the phase shift detected during the synchronization operation has to be stored to enable permanent data communication based on the detected phase shift. The system of EP A 0 037 299 uses a register to store the value of the phase shift which is valid for data communication with an actually addressed terminal. As soon as a new terminal is addressed, synchronization is performed again, and the thereby received phase shift value is again stored in the shift register. Also in a bidirectional digital signal communication system using a spread spectrum for the transmission of data from each of a plurality of terminals, it is necessary that the receiver of the center unit accurately synchronize the position phase of the code pattern of a received signal and the pulse repetition rate or frequency of the bit clock, both of which are transmitted from the terminal unit, with those of a reference signal in the receiver of the center unit. However, the process of synchronization requires a predetermined time, and, if the synchronization process is carried out each time the polling of the terminal units is conducted by the center unit, the amount of data receivable from the terminal units per unit of time is substantially reduced, so that the transmission efficiency is lowered. An object of the invention is to provide a bidirectional digital signal communication system in which a terminal unit can be accessed by a center unit within a minimum period of time and the amount of data receivable from the terminal units per unit of time is increased, so that the transmission efficiency is raised. The bidirectional digital signal communication system of the present invention includes a plurality of terminal units in communication with the center unit, In the system according to the present invention, the center unit comprises a special detector for detecting optimum synchronization. This is done by detecting the maximum level of the digital signal from the de spread received signal. Synchronization is performed by presetting a pseudo noise code generator by different preset codes. The preset code for which synchronization is optimum, is stored in a memory in relation with the actually addressed terminal. Synchronization and storing of a preset code is performed for each terminal unit. As soon as a terminal unit is addressed afterwards, the preset code for the addressed terminal unit is read from the memory, and the pseudo noise code generator is preset with this code. Thereafter, no more synchronization or only a fine adjustment of synchronization is necessary. By changing the preset code, it is possible to perform phase shift in a bitwise manner. However, the actual phase shift may have a part which is only a fraction of the period of a bit. According to a preferred embodiment, a system according to the present invention additionally comprises a shift register which shifts the generated pseudo noise code by a predetermined fraction of a bit period. Thereby fine synchronization is performed. As soon as the detector which detects the maximum level of the received despread signal detects optimum synchronization, not only the preset code is stored, as described above, but additionally the bit fraction is stored by which the pseudo noise code is shifted by said shift register. A better understanding of the objects, features, and advantages of the present invention may be gained from a consideration of the following detailed description of embodiments thereof, taken in conjunction with accompanying figures, in which like reference characters designate like elements and parts and wherein Fig. 2 schematically illustrates a center unit 1 and a representative terminal unit 2 of a bidirectional digital signal communication system constructed in accordance with the invention. The center unit 1 comprises a transmitter 1a and a receiver 1b, and the terminal unit 2 comprises a transmitter 2a and a receiver 2b. The transmission data signal from the transmitter 1a of the center unit 1 is supplied through a high pass filter H of a filter 4 and a transmission line or cable 3 to the terminal unit 2. It then passes through a high pass filter H of a filter 5 and is received and demodulated by the receiver 2b of the terminal unit 2. The data signal from the transmitter 2a of the terminal unit 2 is supplied through a low pass filter L of the filter 5 and the transmission cable 3 to the center unit 1. It then passes through a low pass filter L of the filter 4 and is received and demodulated by the receiver 1b of the center unit 1. These are the fundamental operations which are carried out in the bidirectional digital signal communication system. In the case of transmission of a data signal through up link, in order to prevent deterioration of the S N signal to noise ratio due to heat generated by a resistor in the last stage of the terminal unit 2, etc., the data signal and a PN code are first multiplied with each other. That is, the data is encoded in a spread spectrum. The encoded data is then transmitted in the form, for example, of a PSK modulated signal. In the down link, the signal may be PSK modulated or may be modulated by frequency shift keying, amplitude shift keying, etc. In the center unit 1, data from each of the terminal units 2 is collected by interrogating the terminal unit 2 of each subscriber in a process generally called polling . The data collected may relate to the ON or OFF status of subscribers television receivers, selected channel information, etc. Figs. 3A to 3C respectively illustrate examples of various signals transmitted through the down link. Fig. 3A illustrates an example of a bit clock with the frequency f In a bidirectional digital signal communication system using a spread spectrum, it is necessary that the receiver 1b of the center unit 1 accurately synchronize the position phase of a code pattern of a received signal and the pulse repetition rate or frequency of the bit clock, both of which are transmitted from the terminal unit 2, with those of the reference signal in the receiver 1b of the center unit 1. However, the process of synchronization requires a predetermined time and, if the synchronization process is carried out each time the polling of the terminal unit 2 is conducted by the center unit 1, the amount of data receivable from the terminal units 2 is substantially reduced, so that the transmission efficiency is lowered. Figs. 4 to 9 illustrate the structure and function of a preferred embodiment of apparatus in accordance with the invention. Fig. 4 shows the transmitter 2a provided in each terminal unit 2. In Fig. 4, reference numeral 11 designates an input terminal to which a data signal is supplied. The data supplied to the input terminal 11 may represent the ON or OFF status of the associated television receiver, selected channel information, etc. The signal data at the input terminal 11 is supplied to one input terminal of a multiplier 12. The multiplier 12 is supplied at the other input terminal thereof with a PN pseudo noise code see Fig. 5C produced from an output terminal Q₃ of an M sequence code generator 13 which is used as a PN code generator. The generator 13 includes a shift register 13a that is shifted by a clock signal see Fig. 5B, which is not to the same scale as Fig. 3A with frequency of If N is the number of stages of the shift register in the M sequence code generator 13 serving as the PN code generator, 2 and the initial phase of the PN code is set at a time determined by the frame synchronizing pulse Fig. 5A which is supplied from a terminal 19 to the load terminal L of the shift register 13a. More specifically, during a period in which the frame synchronizing pulse Fig. 5A is supplied from the terminal 19 to the load terminal L of the shift register 13a, the clock signal Fig. 5B is supplied from the terminal 14 to the clock terminal CK of the shift register 13a. In synchronism with an edge, for example the rising edge, of the clock signal, a predetermined preset signal, for example 111 , is set at preset terminals A, B and C of the shift register 13a. Thus, the frame synchronizing pulse and the PN code of the M sequence code generator 13 coincide with each other in phase, as Fig. 5 shows. Times t₁ and t₂ are respectively times when the shift register 13a is preset by the frame synchronizing pulse as described above. The output of an XOR gate output is high if one and only one input is high. Otherwise, the output of an XOR gate is low. the states of the Q₁, Q₂, Q₃ outputs of the shift register 13a and of the inputs and outputs of XOR gate 13b are therefore as shown in the following table As the table and Fig. 4 indicate, the successive outputs of the XOR gate 13b are shifted into the SI terminal of the unit register 13a and through the shift register 13a one stage at a time with each clock pulse supplied from the terminal 14 to the input terminal CK. Thus after seven clock pulses the shift register 13a is returned to its initial state. The Q₃ output thereof therefore repeatedly produces the output 1110100, as shown in the table and in Fig. 5C. The data spread with the PN code is transmitted over the up link 3 to the center unit 1 in which it is de spread from the PN code and then demodulated to the original data. Fig. 6 shows a preferred embodiment of the circuit arrangement of the center unit 1. The center unit comprises the transmitting section 1a and the receiving section 1b briefly described above in connection with Fig. 2. The transmitting section 1a includes a data generator 23 and a frame synchronizing signal generator 24. A data signal Fig. 7D and a frame synchronizing signal Fig. 7C are respectively extracted from the data generator 23 and the frame synchronizing signal generator 24 by a bit clock see Fig. 7A, which is not to the same scale as Fig. 5B with frequency f A data signal received by the center unit from the terminal unit is supplied through a low pass filter portion L of the filter 4 to one input terminal of a multiplier 29. The other input terminal of the multiplier 29 is supplied with a PN code for de spreading the data transmitted from the terminal unit. The output from the multiplier 29 is supplied to a demodulator 30, and the data demodulated thereby is supplied to an output terminal 31. Thereafter, though not shown, the demodulated output is supplied to a level control circuit in which the level control of 1 and 0 is carried out on the basis of a bit clock which is reproduced from the demodulated output. The transmitted data is thus restored to the original data. The receiving section 1b is provided with an M sequence code generator 32 comprising a shift register 32a and an XOR gate 32b. The generator 32a is similar to the M sequence code generator 13 Fig. 4 of the terminal unit. Preset data of 3 bits is set in preset terminals A, B and C of the shift register 32a by a control circuit 33 at a time determined by a frame synchronizing pulse P produced by the timing signal generator 26, a PN signal as shown in Fig. 8A is developed at its output terminal Q₃. Further, since the transmission delay time between the center unit and the terminal unit can assume within limits a random value, not only must the sequence of the received and locally generated PN codes be matched with each other, but also a fine phase adjustment must be made to compensate for the time required for the transmission of the received PN code. For this reason, a shift register 36 which is formed of D type flip flop circuits arranged in four stages is connected to the output of the shift register 32a. The shift register 36 is shifted by a clock signal with a frequency of generated by the timing signal generator 26. The outputs from the terminals Q₁, Q₂, Q₃ and Q₄ of the shift register 36 are respectively shown in Figs. 8B to 8E. Successive ones of these outputs are phase shifted by an amount equal to one quarter of a bit and are respectively supplied to a switching circuit 37. The switching circuit 37 has preset terminals D and E and, after the switching circuit 37 is preset by the controller 33, the state of the switching circuit 37 is changed on the basis of the address data. Accordingly, relative to the data spread with the PN code supplied to one input terminal of the multiplier 29, the phase of the PN code supplied to the other input terminal of the multiplier 29 is displaced in turn as shown in Fig. 8. This is accomplished as the controller 33 sequentially switches the switching circuit 37. The PN code produced by the switching circuit 37 is supplied to the second input terminal of the multiplier 29, and the signals supplied to the two input terminals of the multiplier 29 are multiplied with each other. The output of the multiplier 29 is then detected by the level detector 35, and the value of the data to be preset in the shift register 32a and the switching circuit 37 in order to maximize the level of the output from the multiplier 29 is stored in the memory 34 as an address to be used on the next occasion when polling in accordance with the serial number of each terminal unit and under the control of the controller 33 is carried out. When polling is carried out after the above described processing is completed for all of the terminal units, the controller 33 causes the appropriate address data from the memory 34 to be set in the shift register 32a and the switching circuit 37. The locally generated PN code derived from the switching circuit 37 as described above and the data from each terminal unit are multiplied with each other in the multiplier 29. That is, the locally generated PN code is delayed by a time sufficient to eliminate or minimize the phase difference between it and the identical PN code which is transmitted from the terminal unit. Thus, the time required for establishing the synchronization is reduced. Since the phase of the PN code can be adjusted in increments of 1 4 bit as mentioned above, the maximum correlation loss CL The above described synchronization establishment and the writing of the sequence and phase of the PN code in the memory can be carried out several times a day for the purpose of compensating for changes in the delay time due to external factors such as temperature and so on. In accordance with the invention, the data spread with the PN code is transmitted at least over in the up link, on the basis of the synchronizing signal transmitted over the down link. The PN code of the maximum level and the data corresponding to the phase thereof in the up link are stored in the memory 34 and thereafter used as the address data for each terminal unit during the next polling procedure so that the time required to establish synchronization is reduced and the data is transmitted efficiently. Thus there is provided in accordance with the invention a novel and highly effective bidirectional digital signal communication system especially adapted for use in transmitting a digital signal through a CATV cable television transmission line and similar communication links. Many modifications of the preferred embodiment of the invention described above will readily occur to those skilled in the art upon consideration of this disclosure. For example, the phase of the PN code can be adjusted by the switching circuit 37 in increments other than 1 4 bit, thereby adjusting the maximum correlation loss. Accordingly, the invention is to be construed as including all structure that falls within the scope of the appended claims.
