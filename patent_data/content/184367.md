# Process for producing electroconductive resin composite.

## Abstract
An electroconductive resin composite is produced by polymerizing at least one monomer a polymer of which is electroconductive in a matrix of a resin which exhibits the anisotropy in the melt phase to form a composite of the obtained polymer and the resin. The resin composite is obtained in the form of film and a moulded article.
