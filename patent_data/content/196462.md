## Description
The invention pertains to random access memo ry devices, and integrated arrays utilizing the same, and improved bidirectional threshold means and liquid crystal displays utilizing the same. Random access memory devices have been made by using flip flops incorporating at least a pair of cross coupled transistors. A flip flop has two stable states and provides the ability to store one bit of information in binary form. Arrays of flip flops can be addressed in a random access fashion and have been found useful as static ran dom access memories in various types of digital systems. One disadvantage of random access memo ries formed out of flip flops is that at least two cross coupled transistors are necessary in each storage location. When such random access memo ries are formed as integrated structures, because at least two transistors are necessary for each storage location, the packing density which can be achieved with this technology is correspondingly limited. Additionally, the process of forming the transistors is relatively complex. As an alternate to static random access memo ries incorporating flip flops as discussed above, dynamic memory units have been formed using shift registers. In dynamic memory units, charge is stored for a predetermined period of time on a ca pacitor. At the end of that time interval the charge is shifted to an adjacent capacitor. The charge moves along a sequential string of capaci tors from one to the next at predetermined clock intervals. When a given packet of charge has reached the end of the shift register it can be sensed and or fed back into the other end of the register so that the corresponding bit of informa tion will recirculate. Dynamic storage units can be formed with a higher packing density than can static units of the type discussed above. However, dynamic memory units must generate control and clock pulses whose function is to shift the charge, corresponding to the information, sequentially from one capacitor to the next. Additionally, the amount of informa tion that can be stored per unit area in an inte grated memory unit of this type is limited by the number of stages which can be connected together in the shift register. This is in turn limited by both the size of the capacitors that can be inte grated into the device and the device area occu pied by the circuitry which generates the neces sary clock pulses. In addition, dynamic shift registers are not randomly addressable. Informa tion can only be accessed when it is shifted to the end of the shift register. This inability to randomly address information stored in a register can be undesirable in many types of applications. The present invention provides a dynamic ran dom access memory comprising readable charge stor age means for storing an electrical charge and threshold means for enabling the charging of the charge storage means. The memory of the present invention further includes means for enabling the detection of the electrical charge stored in the charge storage means. The charge storage means can be a capacitor with the threshold means ar ranged to enable charging of the capacitor to either a positive or a negative voltage. As further provided by the present invention, the charge storage means and the threshold means are formed as a multilayered structure of succes sively deposited, vertically arrayed, layers of materials. A first group of the layers forms the charge storage means which can be a capacitor. A second group of the layers provides semiconductor interaction therebetween to form the threshold means. The threshold means of the present invention can be bidirectional threshold means formed from deposited semiconductor materials such as amor phous semiconductor alloys comprising n i n bidi rectional threshold devices or p i n diodes formed in diode rings. The threshold means can also com prise, in accordance with an alternative embodi ment, a pair of threshold devices, each being in dependently addressable and coupled together only at the charge storage means. The invention also provides addressing means for defining unique randomly addressable storage locations. Each storage location includes charge storage means coupled to threshold means to enable the storage of electrical charge on the charge storage means. The addressing means provide for addressing each storage element in the array uniquely. When the threshold means comprises bi directional threshold means, the addressing means can include first and second sets of spaced apart address lines. When the threshold means comprises a pair of threshold devices coupled together only at the charge storage means, the addressing means can include first, second, and third sets of ad dress lines. In accordance with a further alternative em bodiment of the present invention, the charge storage means can include a layer of charge stor age material of the type having deep traps for storing charge. The charge storage material can be, for example, silicon nitride Si In yet another embodiment of the present in vention, the threshold means can include first and second parallel coupled branches. Each branch can include a diode and a potential source. The branches are coupled with reverse polarity so as to form a bidirectional threshold element. In one embodiment, the potential sources are formed as batteries. In another embodiment, the potential sources are formed as photovoltaic diodes. A memory array or matrix can be formed in ac cordance with the present invention with discrete potential sources associated with each threshold means. In yet another embodiment of the inven tion, the potential sources can be shared among a plurality of threshold means. The present invention further provides a bi directional threshold means for establishing first and second threshold voltages of opposite polari ty. The threshold means includes a first thresh old device having a first threshold voltage and a second threshold device having a second threshold voltage. The first and second threshold devices are coupled together to establish first and second threshold voltages of opposite polarity. First and second potential sources coupled in series with the first and second threshold devices re spectively back bias the first and second thresh old devices and increase the effective absolute magnitude of the first and second threshold volt ages. The invention further provides a light in fluencing display comprising a plurality of pix els, at least one said pixel including a pair of electrodes, at least one of said electrodes being light transmissive, isolation means coupled to one of said electrodes to enable the selective appli cation of driving potentials across said elec trodes, and light influencing material disposed between said electrodes. The isolation means in cludes bidirectional threshold means for estab lishing first and second threshold voltages of op posite polarity. The bidirectional threshold means includes a first threshold device having a first threshold voltage and a second threshold de vice having a second threshold voltage.

The preferred embodiment of this invention will now be described by way of example, with re ference to the drawings accompanying this specification in which Accordingly, a first object of the invention is to provide a dynamic memory including charge storage means for storing an electrical charge, characterized by threshold means to enable the storage or charge in the charge storage means, the threshold means includes at least one threshold device formed from a deposited semiconductor mate rial.

Referring now to Figure 1, it illustrates an example of a dynamic memory unit 10 known from the prior art. The memory unit 10 includes a plurali ty of capacitors, 12 through 20, which may be in tegrated. Each of the capacitors 12 through 20 represents a temporary storage location for a quantum of charge which is moved successively from capacitor 12 through 14 through 16 through 18 through 20 as a function of time. A plurality of AND gates 22 through 26 interconnects the capaci tors 12 through 20. Each AND gate 22 26 itself includes adequate capacitance to facilitate this transfer. Shift pulses on a line 30 which are generated by a control unit 32 in combination with the re spective AND gates 22 through 26 transfer the charge on the capacitors 12 through 18 to the suc cessive capacitors 14 through 20. An output gate 34 connects an output signal on a line 36 back to an input gate 38 for recirculating purposes. As an alternate to recirculating previously stored information, data can be input through the gate 38. The gate 38 is also connected to the control unit 32 by a line 40. Clock 42 provides signals to drive the unit 10. As can be seen from Figure 1 the information is shifted through the string of capacitors 12 through 20 and then recirculated again to effect the storage function. Figure 2 is a fragmentary schematic circuit diagram of an array 50 embodying the present in vention. The array 50 of Figure 2 includes a first set of address lines 52 and 54, arbitrarily labeled C1 and C2. Crossing over but not connect ed to the first set of address lines is a second set of address lines 56 and 58, labeled R1 and R2. At the crossovers of the respective members of the first set of address lines and second set of address lines, corresponding to a crossover 60, are formed a plurality of memory storage cells 62 through 68. Each of the storage cells 62 through 68 is a dynamic memory cell which is randomly ad dressable. Each of the cells 62 through 68 can be addressed using corresponding address lines 52, 54 and 56, 58. Unlike the prior art dynamic memory unit of Figure 1, the information stored in each of the cells 62 through 68 may be addressed at anytime and not just when that information is present at a down stream location, such as at the input to the gate 34 of Figure 1. With respect to exemplary memory cell 62, each of the memory cells includes a bidirectional threshold device 70 coupled in series with a ca pacitor 72. The bidirectional threshold device 70 is indicated in Figure 2 as being formed of a diode ring having first and second diodes 74 and 76 which are coupled in parallel to one another with reverse polarity. Each of the additional memory cells 64 through 68 is identical to the memory cell 62. It will be understood that any bidirectional threshold device having a transfer function similar to that of the diode ring 70 is usable with the circuitry of the memory cells 62 68. Figure 3A is an idealized transfer function for a bidirectional threshold emement 70. Element 70 has a first threshold V As will be described subsequently, each bi directional threshold element can be a single threshold device having the transfer function gen erally shown in Figure 3B or a pair of threshold devices, such as diodes, combined together to exhibit a transfer function as generally shown in Figure 3B. Also, in accordance with additional embodiments to be described susbsequently, the threshold means can be other than a bidirectional threshold means as illustrated in Figure 2. For example, the threshold means can include a pair of threshold devices, such as diodes. The diodes are coupled together only at the charge storage means. Each diode is arranged to enable the charging of the charge storage means to a respective different voltage polarity. Each threshold element or device must have the following characteristics. For voltage values greater than some voltage called V Referring now to Figure 4A, it illustrates a series of waveforms associated with writing a logical 1 or a 0 into the memory element 62 located at the cross point of row line 56 and column line 52. It must first be mentioned that all memory locations which are not being written into or read and refreshed are maintained in a condition whereby the respective bidirectional threshold devices are biased at a voltage between V This is accomplished by applying a .25 volts to the column lines and a .625 volts to the row lines associated with the bidirectional threshold devices during one time period and then applying a .25 volts to the column lines and a .625 volts to the row lines during the next time period. This sequence is alternated so that the bidirec tional threshold devices of the memory cells not being written into or read and refreshed are maintained at a potential of plus or minus .375 volts. As a result, the voltage across these bidirectional threshold devices will be maintained between a V Referring now more particularly to Figure 4A, between time periods t₁ and t₂ no memory cell is being written into and a .25 volts is applied to the column lines and a .625 volts is applied to the row lines. At time t₂, a 1 volt is applied to column line 52, also labeled C1. The other column lines, such as column line 54, also labeled C2, have a .25 volts applied thereto at time t₂. It can also be seen that a .625 volts is applied to the row line 58, also labeled R2, at time t₂. During the time period beginning at t₂ and ending at t₃ a positive write current is applied to row line 56, also labeled R1 to write a logical 1 into the addressed memory cell. This write current causes the capacitor 72 to charge towards a positive voltage. By the end of the write period, at t₃, a positive voltage of about .125 volts will appear at the row line 56. If the mem ory cell 62 had been previously written with a logical 0, the voltage will increase at line 56 as indicated by the solid line 31 of Figure 4A. However, if the memory cell 62 had previously been written with a logical 1, the voltage at line 56 will change during the time period t₂ and t₃ as shown by the dashed line 33. During the time period between t₂ and t₃ any memory cell coupled to column line 52 could be written with a logical 1 as discussed above. Hence, parallel writing is made possible. The waveforms of Figure 4A also depict the writing of a logical 0 into memory cell 62 dur ing the time period beginning at t₃ and ending at t₄. During this time period it can be noted that the other column and row lines not associated with memory cell 62 have applied thereto a .25 volts on the column lines and a .625 volts on the row lines. To write a logical 0 into memory cell 62, a 1.0 volt is applied to column line 52 and a negative current is applied to the row line 56. This write current causes the capacitor 72 to be charged in the negative direction and the voltage at the row line 56 will decrease from its positive logical 1 level to a .125 volts as shown by the solid line 35 of Figure 4A. If the memory cell 62 had previously been written with a logical 0, then the voltage on the row 56 would change as shown by the dashed line 37 of Figure 4A. Again, any one of the memory cells associated with column line 52 could be written with a logical 0 along with the writing of memory cell 62. As a result, at t₄ the writing of all of the memory cells asso ciated with column line 52 is completed and the foregoing sequence can be repeated for another column line. Referring now to Figure 4B, it illustrates a series of waveforms associated with reading and refreshing the memory cell 62 of Figure 2. As il lustrated, the memory cell 62 is being read during the time period beginning at t₂ and ending at t₃ and being refreshed during the time period begin ning at t₃ and ending at t₄. Throughout the read and refresh cycle of mem ory cell 62 the columns not associated with memory cell 62 receive an applied voltage alternating be tween .25 volts and .25 volts during alternate time periods and the rows not associated with mem ory cell 62 received an applied voltage alternat ing between .625 volts and .625 volts during al ternate time periods. At time t₂ when memory cell 62 is to be read, a 1 volt is applied to column 52 and positive read current is applied to row 56 identified as I If a logical 0 is stored in the memory cell 62, the voltage on row 56 will appear as illus trated by the dashed line 43 in Figure 4B. The difference between the voltages of a logical 1 and a logical 0 as illustrated is .25 volts less any loss of charge since the last read and refresh cycle. This difference can be detected for pur poses of refreshing the memory cell. If the memory cell is storing a logical 0, a negative refresh current is applied between time periods t₃ and t₄ as shown by the dashed lines 45 to cause the capacitor 72 to be charged in the negative direction. Preferably, the refresh cur rent magnitude is twice that of the read current magnitude so as to restore the logical 0 level in memory cell 62 to its proper value. If the memory cell 62 is storing a logical 1, then the current applied to the row line 56 is terminated at t₃ because the read current has already re freshed the memory cell to its proper value. Figure 5 illustrates a sectional view of part of the array 50 and a sectional view of the struc ture of the memory element 62. The array 50 is formed on a substrate 90 which may be glass or any other suitable insulator. The address or select line 52 is carried on a surface of the substrate 90 and may be formed of tantalum. A tantalum layer can be applied over the substrate 90 and etched using photolithography to form a plurality of spaced apart address lines such as the line 52. The tantalum layer 52 is then oxidized to form Ta₂ O₅ pads which are shown as pads 92, 92a on top of the address line 52. Chromium pads 94, 94a are then formed above the oxidized pads 92, 92a. The capacitor 72 is formed at the crossover of the metal address line 52 and the chromium pad 94a. A region 92a of tantalum oxide is positioned therebetween and forms the dielectric of the ca pacitor 72. Above the chromium pad 94a is formed the bi directional threshold device 70. As illustrated in Figure 5 the element 70 can be, for example, a three layer 96, 98, and 100 n i n device. Such devices are disclosed in United States Patent Application Serial No. 603,852, filed April 25, 1984 and entitled Programmable Semiconductor Switch For A Display Matrix Or The Like and Method Of Making Same which application is assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The dis closure of said patent application is hereby in corporated by reference. The layers 96, 98, and 100 are preferably formed from deposited semiconductor material. The deposited semiconductor material is preferably an amorphous semiconductor alloy including silicon. The amorphous silicon alloy can also include hy drogen and or fluorine and can be formed by, for example, plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition i.e. glow discharge as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,226,898 to S.R. Ovshinsky et al for Amorphous Semiconductors Equivalent To Crystalline Semiconductors Produced By A Glow Dis charge Process, the disclosure of which patent is incorporated herein by reference. By the term amorphous is meant an alloy or material which has long range disorder, although it may have short or intermediate order or even contain at times some crystalline inclusions. The n i n device 70 disclosed above has a transfer function corresponding to Figure 3B and idealized in Figure 3A. While not a diode ring, the n i n device 70 will function as a bidirec tional threshold element. The n layer 100 is covered by the address line 56. Adjacent the memory cell 62 on the ad dress line 52 is formed the memory cell 66. The structure of the memory cell 66 is identical to the structure of the cell 62. The capacitor 72 formed by the tantalum ad dress line 52, the oxide layer 92a and the adja cent chromium pad 94a is on the order of 20 mi crons by 20 microns. This provides a capacitance of about 1 picofarad. If a greater capacitance is desired, the area of the layers 92a and 94a can be made larger. The structure of Figure 5 can be formed by first applying a tantalum layer over the substrate 90. The tantalum layer can be patterned using photolithography to form a plurality of parallel spaced apart address lines such as 52 and 54. The tantalum layer can then be anodized to form a Ta₂O₅ layer. A layer of chromium can then be de posited over the Ta₂O₅ layer. Using a second mask, the chromium layer and the Ta₂O₅ layer can be patterned to form the pads 92, 94 and 92a, 94a. Then an n doped layer of amorphous semicon ductor alloy material, an intrinsic, essentially undoped, layer of amorphous semiconductor alloy material and a second n doped layer can be depos ited over the pads and address lines. The entire multilayer structure can then be covered by a final metal layer. Using a third mask, the final metal layer and the n i n layers can be etched away so as to form the storage element 62 shown in Figure 5. Figure 6 illustrates a perspective view of a fragment of the matrix of Figure 2. In Figure 6 the substrate 90 is shown with the tantalum ad dress lines 52, 54 formed thereon. The layers 52 and 54 are each shown with oxidized top pads such as 92, 92a. The storage element 62 is shown form ed vertically above a pad 92a of the tantalum oxide. The storage element 62 includes the chro mium pad 94a, the n doped layer 96, the intrinsic layer 98 and the n doped layer 100. The layer 100 is covered by the address line 56. As can be seen from Figure 6, the address lines 56 and 58 are spaced apart from one another and crossover the address lines 52, 54 with the storage element 62 positioned therebetween. The structure of each of the memory locations 62 68 as can be seen in Figure 6, is a vertical structure resulting in a very high packing densi ty. The bidirectional threshold elements, such as 70, and the readable charge storage elements, such as capacitor 72 are vertically arrayed with re spect to the corresponding address lines 52, 56. The address lines 52, 56 are positioned on oppo site sides of the multilayer structure containing threshold element 70 and capacitor 72. Another advantage of the memory unit, such as 62 of Figure 6, is that refreshing of the charge stored on the capacitor 72 occurs with respect to the same ca pacitor and the information is not shifted from one capacitor to another for refresh purposes. Each of the memory locations, such as the lo cation 62, is a multilayered structure with each bidirectional threshold element, such as 70, being a multilayered structure of successively deposited vertically arrayed layers, such as 96 100, of var ious materials. A first group of the layers, such as layers 52, 92a and 94a forms the charge storage capacitor 72. A second group of layers 96, 98, 100, combine to provide a semiconductor interaction to form the bidirectional threshold element 70. Figure 7 illustrates an alternate embodiment of the present invention. In Figure 7 an insulat ing substrate 101 has a tantalum address line 102 formed thereon. A top surface of the address line 102 has been oxidized and patterned to form oxide pads 104, 104a. Positioned on the oxidized pads 104 and 104a are first and second storage elements 106 and 108. The element 106 is formed with an amorphous semiconductor alloy three layer bidirec tional threshold device 110 having a highly doped layer 112 of n type conductivity, an intrinsic amorphous semiconductor alloy layer 114 formed over the n plus layer 112 and a second highly doped layer 116 of n type conductivity formed over the intrinsic layer 114. A second address line 118 of metal covers the n plus amorphous semicon ductor alloy layer 116. The device 110 of Figure 7 operates as a bidirectional threshold element as do the corresponding devices in Figures 5 and 6. In the embodiment of Figure 7 the doped layer 112 functions as one contact or plate of the charge storage capacitor as well as a region of the threshold device 110. Referring now to Figures 8 and 9, they illus trate another memory cell or location 120 embody ing the present invention. Here, the bidirection al device is formed from a pair of p i n diodes which are coupled together as illustrated in Fig ure 2. The memory cell 120 of Figure 8 is formed on an insulative substrate 122, such as glass, for example. Formed on the glass substrate 122 is a first metal layer of chromium 124 which forms a first electrode of the charge storage means or ca pacitor of the cell 120 and also a column address line in the region indicated at 126. Formed over the chromium 124 is a layer of dielectric material 128 which can be, for example, silicon dioxide. The dielectric 128 forms the dielectric layer of the capacitor or charge storage means of the memo ry cell 120. Alternatively, the layer 124 could be formed from tantalum as previously described and the dielectric layer 128 could be provided by anodizing a portion of the tantalum to form Ta₂O₅. Over the dielectric 128 is formed a second metal layer 130 which can also be formed from chromium. The layer 130 forms the second elec trode of the capacitor or charge storage means of the memory cell 120. Formed on the dielectric layer 128 is a con ductive pad 132 which can also be formed from chromium. Formed on the metal layer 130 is a diode 136 and formed on the metal pad 132 is a second diode 138. The diodes 136 and 138 are pre ferably formed during the same deposition process and comprise a p type region, an intrinsic region, and an n type region. The diodes 136 and 138 are also preferably formed from deposited semiconduc tor materials and most preferably amorphous semi conductor alloys as disclosed, for example, in the aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 4,226,898. The diodes 136 and 138 also include a top metal layer 137 and 139 formed from chromium, for example, to provide a good ohmic contact with the diodes. The memory cell 120 further includes insulat ing layer regions 140. The insulating layer re gions 140 can be formed from any deposited insulator such as silicon oxide or silicon nitride. During the photolithography step in forming the regions 140, openings or vias 142, 144, 146, 148, and 149 can be formed therein to expose surface portions of the diodes and the metal layers to al low a top metal layer having separate regions 150, 150a to interconnect the diodes and the metal layer 130 to form the bidirectional threshold de vice in series with the capacitor formed by the metal layers 124 and 130 and the dielectric layer 128. The top metal 150 not only serves to inter connect the diodes and the capacitor, but in addi tion can also be used to form the row address lines in portions thereof indicated at 152. Referring now to Figure 10, it illustrates in fragmentary schematic circuit diagram form another dynamic memory matrix 200 embodying the present invention. The array 200 includes a first set of address lines 202 and 204 arbitrarily labeled R1 and R2. Crossing over but not connected to the first set of address lines are a second set of ad dress lines 206 and 208 arbitrarily labeled CP1 and CP2 and a third set of address lines 210 and 212 arbitrarily labeled CN1 and CN2. The first set of address lines 202 and 204 comprise the row select address lines and the second and third sets of address lines comprise the column address lines. At the crossovers of the respective members of the first set of address lines and the second and third sets of address lines are formed a plurality of memory storage cells 214, 216, 218, and 220. Each of the storage cells 214 220 is a dynamic memory cell which is randomly addressable. Each of the cells 214 through 220 can be addressed using one of the row select lines with a corresponding pair of the column address lines. With respect to an exemplary memory cell 214, each of the memory cells includes a threshold means 222 coupled to a charge storage means such as a capacitor 224. In accordance with this pre ferred embodiment, the threshold means 222 com prises a pair of threshold devices, such as diodes 226 and 230. The diodes 226 and 230 are coupled together only at the capacitor 224 at a common terminal 232 and to a respective one of the column address lines at their opposite terminals. As a result, one of the diodes is arranged for charging the capacitor to a first polarity and the other diode is arranged for charging the capacitor to a second polarity wherein the first and second po larities are opposite in potential. Each of the additional memory cells 216, 218, and 220 is iden tical to the memory cell 214. Referring now to Figure 11A, the waveforms there shown illustrate a manner in which a logical 1 or a logical 0 can be written into the memo ry cells of Figure 10. If a logical 1 is to be written into memory cell 214 at t₁, a 1 volt is applied to address line 206, a 1 volt is applied to address line 210, and a positive write current is applied to the row address line 202. As a re sult of the foregoing, the diodes 226 and 230 will be forward biased to permit the charging of the capacitor 224 in a positive direction. If the memory cell 214 had previously not been written into or had a logical 0 stored therein, the voltage on the row address line 202 will follow the solid line 240. If memory cell 214 had previously been writ ten with a logical 1, the voltage at the row ad dress line 202 would follow the dashed line 242. As can be noted in Figure 11A, the voltage on the row address line 202 is permitted to rise to a voltage of .250 volts which denotes a logical 1. At t₂ the voltages applied to the column ad dress lines 206 and 210 are reversed in polarity to back bias diodes 226 and 230 leaving a positive charge remaining on the capacitor 224 for storing a logical 1 therein. To write a logical 0 into memory cell 214 at t₃, a 1 volt is applied to the column address line 206, a 1 volt is applied to the column ad dress line 210, and a negative write current is applied to the row address line 202. Again, the diodes 226 and 230 are forward biased and permit the capacitor 224 to be charged in a negative di rection to .250 volts for storing a logical 0 in memory cell 214. If memory cell 214 had pre viously not been written into or had been written with a logical 1 the voltage at the row line 202 will follow the solid line 244. If memory cell 214 had been written with a logical 0, the volt age at line 202 would follow the dashed line 246. As can be seen from the foregoing, a logical 1 is represented by a .250 volts and a logical 0 is represented by a .250 volts. As a result, the difference in voltage between the two logic levels is .5 volts which is readily readable for determining the logic state of a memory cell. During the writing into of the memory cell 214, all of the column address lines not asso ciated therewith have voltages applied thereto for back biasing the diodes associated with the memory cells corresponding to the other column address lines. These diodes can be back biased by apply ing a 1 volt to one column address line and a 1 volt to the other address line to assure that the diodes are back biased. Also, since the same voltages are applied to the pair of column address lines 206 and 210 regardless of whether a logical 1 or logical 0 is being written into the memo ry cell 214, it can be realized that each memory cell having column address lines 206 and 210 in common can be written in parallel. Further more, the memory cells common to these column ad dress lines can be parallel written with either a logical 1 or a logical 0 simultaneously to al low an entire column to be written into during the same write period. Referring now to Figure 11B, the waveforms there shown illustrate the manner in which a memo ry cell is read and refreshed. Again, particular reference is made to memory cell 214 of Figure 10. To read memory cell 214, at time t₁, a 1 volt is applied to column address line 206 and 1 volt is applied to column address line 210. These applied voltages forward bias the diodes 226 and 230 to permit a read voltage to be read on the row address line 202 upon the application of a posi tive read current thereto. If the memory cell 214 has a logical 1 stored therein, the read voltage on line 202 will appear as illustrated by the solid line 248 and if the memory cell 214 has a logical 0 stored therein the voltage on line 202 will appear as il lustrated by the dashed line 250. At t₂, if a logical 1 has been read, the read current is terminated because the positve potential on the capacitor 224 will still remain by virtue of the positive read current applied to the row line 202. However, if a logical 0 is read, a nega tive current is applied at t₂ and terminates at t₃. The negative current causes the capacitor 224 to be charged in the negative direction to restore the voltage stored therein to the proper logical 0 level. Referring now to Figure 12A, the waveforms there shown illustrate a different manner in which a logical 1 or a logical 0 can be written into the memory cells of Figure 10. If a logical 1 is to be written into memory cell 214 at t₁, a 1 volt is applied to address line 206, a 1 volt is applied to address line 210, and a positive write current is applied to the row address line 202. As a result of the foregoing, the diode will be forward biased to permit the charging of the ca pacitor 224 in a positive direction and diode 226 will be back biased. If the memory cell 214 had previously not been written into or had a logical 0 stored therein, the voltage on the row address line 202 will follow the solid line 290. If memo ry cell 214 had previously been written with a logical 1, the voltage at the row address line 202 would follow the dashed line 292. As can be noted in Figure 12A, the voltage on the row ad dress line 202 is permitted to rise to a voltage of .250 volts which denotes a logical 1. At t₂ the voltage applied to the column address line 210 is reversed in polarity to back bias diode 230 leaving a positive charge remaining on the capaci tor 224 for storing a logical 1 therein. To write a logical 0 into memory cell 214 at t₃, a 1 volt is applied to the column address line 206, a 1 volt is applied to the column ad dress line 210, and a negative write current is applied to the row address line 202. As a result, diode 226 is forward biased to permit the capaci tor 224 to be charged in a negative direction to .250 volts for storing a logical 0 in memory cell 214 and the diode 230 will be back biased. If memory cell 214 had previously not been written into or had been written with a logical 1 the voltage at the row line 202 will follow the solid line 294. If memory cell 214 had been written with a logical 0, the voltage at line 202 would follow the dashed line 296. As can be seen from the foregoing, a logical 1 is again represented by a .250 volts and a logical 0 is again represented by a .250 volts. As a result, the difference in voltage be tween the two logic levels is .5 volts which is readily readable for determining the logic state of a memory cell. During the writing into of the memory cell 214, all of the column address lines not asso ciated therewith have voltages applied thereto for back biasing the diodes associated with the memory cells corresponding to the other column address lines. These diodes can be back biased by apply ing a 1 volt to one column address line and a 1 volt to the other address line to assure that the diodes are back biased. Figure 12B illustrates a read refresh cycle for the typical memory cell 214 of Figure 10. A positive read current is applied to the line 202 while simultaneously addressing the cell 214 by applying a negative one volt potential to the line 206 to reverse bias the diode 226, and a negative one volt potential to the line 210 to forward bias the diode 230. If a logical 1 had previously been written into the cell 214, the measurable voltage on the read current line 202 will approach .25 volt as indicated by a solid line 298 in the lower graph of Figure 12B. However, if a logical 0 had previously been written into the cell 214, the sensed voltage on the line 202, as indicated by a dashed line 294 in Figure 12B, would be about .25 volt negative. For refresh purposes only, in the event that the cell 214 contains a logical 0, the read cur rent I As in the previous embodiments, each memory cell having column address lines 206 and 210 in common which are to be written with a logical 0 , can be written in parallel. Likewise, each memory cell having column address lines 206 and 210 in common which are to be written with a logical 1 , can be written in parallel. However, since dif ferent voltages are applied to the column address lines 206 and 210 during the writing of a logical 0 and logical 1 , the logical 0 s and logical 1 s must be written into the memory cells seri ally. Although this takes more time to accomplish the writing of the logic levels into the memory cells, it does reduce the overall current within the memory during the writing cycles. Referring now to Figures 13 and 14, they il lustrate one structural form that the memory cell 214 can take in accordance with this preferred em bodiment. The memory cell 214 includes an insula tive substrate 252 upon which a first conductive electrode 254 is formed for forming the first electrode of the capacitor 224. Also formed with the electrode 254 is the row address line 202. After the electrode 254 and address line 202 are formed, an insulating layer 256 of silicon dioxide is formed thereover. The second electrode 258 is then formed over the electrode 254 for forming the other electrode of the capacitor 224 along with a conductive pad 260. The diodes 226 and 230 are then formed over the conductive pad 260 and the electrode 258 re spectively. The diodes 226 and 230 are preferably p i n diodes formed from amorphous semiconductor alloys as previously described. The diodes 226 and 230 are completed with the forming of a metal lic layer 262 and 264 thereover for forming a good ohmic contact with the diode. A layer of insulating material 266 is then formed over the partially completed memory cell and is patterned to form a plurality of openings or vias 268, 270, 272, 274, and 276. The vias 268 and 272 expose portions of the metal pad 260, the via 270 exposes the top metal 262 of diode 226, the via 274 exposes a portion of the top electrode 258, and the via 276 exposes the top portion of the diode 230. To complete the memory cell 214, a top metal layer is formed and patterned to interconnect the diodes 226 and 230 with the electrode 258, to form the column address lines 206 and 210, and to make electrical connection between the column address line 206 and the metal pad 260 through the vias 268 and 272. As a result of the foregoing, a structure is completed which corresponds to the schematic circuit diagram of memory cell 214 as illustrated in Figure 10. Other charge storage means are also within the scope of the present invention. For example, for each of the embodiments disclosed herein, a charge storage material, such as a silicon nitride Si In connection with the above noted embodiment using a silicon nitride layer, a write voltage would be applied to that layer to facilitate the injection of carriers into the deep traps. For a silicon nitride layer with a thickness in a range of 150 450 Angstroms, a 5 to 15 volt write voltage would be sufficient depending upon the thickness of the silicon nitride layer. A storage location constructed with a silicon nitride storage layer could be read using any of the previously dis closed read techniques. Figures 15 19 illustrate yet another embodi ment of the present invention. Figure 15 illus trates a bidirectional threshold element 300 with cross coupled threshold diodes 302 and 304 coupled respectively to potential sources 306 and 308. The element 300 is a form of diode ring with the potential sources 306 and 308 differentially bias ing the branches of the ring diode or element 300. Figure 16 illustrates an idealized transfer function for the threshold element 300. The threshold voltages V An advantage that results from inserting the potential sources 306 and 308 into the threshold element 300 is that the resultant memory cell can be driven with larger addressing voltages. Fur ther, the output voltages will be greater, with a greater difference between the sensed output volt ages corresponding to the process of a logical 1 or a logical 0. The noise immunity of the resultant memory cell will thus be enhanced. Figure 17 illustrates an array 320 which is a modified form of the memory array or matrix 200 of Figure 10. The array 320 includes the row address lines 202 and 204 and the column address lines 206, 208, 210 and 212 from the array 200. The array 320 also includes the capacitor 224 and the diodes 226 and 230 from the array 200 of Figure 10. The array 320 includes the bidirectional threshold element 300 illustrated in Figure 15. In Figure 17 the potential sources 322 and 324 which are coupled to an address line 326 form a threshold element incorporating the diodes 226 and 230. The structure of the array 320 is advanta geous in that the potential sources 322 and 324 are shared among a plurality of bidirectional threshold elements such as the threshold element incorporating the diodes 226 and 230 and a thresh old element 328. The element 328 includes a pair of diodes 330 and 332. The diodes 330 and 332 are coupled at a node 334 to a storage capacitor 336. As a result of the inclusion of the potential sources 322 and 324 in the array of Figure 17, the ratio of V However, with the addition of the potential sources 306 and 308 or 322 and 324 the ratio can be reduced as illustrated in Table 1. Figure 18 illustrates an embodiment 340 of the threshold element 300. The element 340 in cludes the diodes 302 and 304 as in Figure 15. However, the potential sources 306 and 308 of Fig ure 15 are in Figure 18 implemented as photovolta ic diodes 342 and 344. Such diodes can be imple mented as deposited amorphous silicon alloy diodes as disclosed in the above noted U.S. Patent No. 4,226,898. The photovoltaic diodes 342, 344 will, in re sponse to photons of incident light P, generate potentials thereacross. The diodes 342 and 344 can be excited by incident light directed at the array 320. In the embodiment of Figure 18, the value V In the embodiment of Figure 18, assuming V Figure 19 is a sectional view of a memory cell 350, having a similar equivalent circuit as the memory cells of Figure 2, but incorporating photo diodes in series with the threshold elements as illustrated in Figure 18. The memory cell 350 of Figure 19 includes many structural elements previously illlustrated in Figure 9. As a result, corresponding identification numerals are used on corresponding elements in Figure 19 as were origi nally used in Figure 9. In the memory cell 350 of Figure 19, thresh old diodes 136 and 138 correspond to the threshold diodes 302 and 304 of the bidirectional threshold element 340 of Figure 18. Deposited over an upper end of each of the diodes 136 and 138 is an opaque metal layer 352 and an opaque metal layer 354. As will become more apparent subsequently, the impor tance of the opaque metal layers 352 and 354, which might be chromium or tantalum lies in the fact that they block incident radition P which might be directed at the memory cell 350. Formed above the opaque metal layer 352 is a diode 356 which is coupled in series, via the metal layer 352 to the diode 136. The series com bination of the diodes 136 and 356 corresponds to the series combination of the diodes 302 and 342 of Figure 18. The diode 356 can be a deposited amorphous silicon alloy photovoltaic diode in ac cordance with the disclosure of the previously noted U.S. Patent No. 4,226,898. The insulating layer 140 illustrated in Fig ure 19 which has been deposited around and over the series coupled diodes 356 and 136 has an open ing or via 358 formed therein. The via 146 pre viously illustrated in Figure 9 is also formed in the insulating layer 140. A layer 360 of a trans parent conducting material, such as indium tin oxide, is deposited coupling the upper end of the diode 356, through the via 358, to the conductive layer 132, through the via 146. The conductive transparent layer 360 permits photons of incident radiation P to pass therethrough and impinge upon the diode 356. As disclosed in the above noted U.S. Patent No. 4,226,898, the diode 356 can be operated as a photovoltaic diode which will generate a potential in response to photons of incident radiation. The potential generated by the diode 356 in response to the photons of incident radiation P corresponds to the potential V In a similar fashion, a second photovoltaic diode 362 is formed in Figure 19 deposited over the opaque conductive layer 354. The series coupled combination of the diode 138 and the pho tovoltaic diode 362 correspond to the series coupled combination of the diode 304 and the pho tovoltaic diode 344 of Figure 18. A further de posited layer 360a of a transparent conductor, in dium tin oxide for example, couples an upper end of the photovoltaic diode 362 to the plate 130 of the storage capacitor of the memory cell 350. As is the case with the diode 356, photons P of inci dent radiation P pass through the indium tin oxide layer 360a and excite the photovoltaic diode 354 which in turn generates the potential V It will be understood in connection with the embodiment of the storage cell 350 of Figure 19 that under normal operating conditions, the appro priate level of photons of incident radiation P would be provided such that the potentials gener ated by the photovoltaic diodes 356 and 362 would have the expected values. It will also be under stood that it is within the scope of the present invention to incorporate other electronic devices, which might be deposited devices, which could gen erate a corresponding value of electrical poten tial other than the above illustrated photovoltaic diodes. Referring now to Figures 20 and 21, they il lustrate a light influencing display, and more particularly a liquid crystal display pixel 400 having a differentially biased ring diode struc ture embodying the present invention. The ring diode structure is formed from two pairs of p i n diodes which are coupled together as illustrated in Figure 22. The liquid crystal display pixel 400 is formed on a transparent insulative sub strate 402, such as glass, for example. Formed on the glass substrate 402 is a first pixel electrode 404 formed from a metal such as chromium for a display which is to operate in the reflective mode, or a transparent conductor such as indium tin oxide for a display which is to operate in the transmissive mode. Formed with the electrode 404 is an elongated conductive pad 406 which can also be formed from chromium, for example. Formed on the electrode 404 are a first pair of diodes 408 comprising diodes 408a and 408b and formed on the metal pad 406 are a second pair of diodes 410 com prising diodes 410a and 410b. The diode pairs 408 and 410 are preferably formed during the same de position process and comprise a p type region, an intrinsic region, and an n type region. The diode pairs 408 and 410 are also preferably formed from deposited semiconductor materials and most prefer ably amorphous semiconductor alloys as disclosed, for example, in the aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 4,226,898. The lower diodes 408a and 410a are separated from the upper diodes 408b and 410b re spectively by metal layers 412 and 414 formed from chromium, for example, which shield the lower diodes from incident light. The pixel 400 further includes insulating layer regions 416. The insulating layer regions 416 can be formed from any deposited insulator such as silicon oxide or silicon nitride. During the photolithography step in forming the regions 416, openings or vias 418, 420, 422, 424, and 426 can be formed therein to expose surface portions of the diodes and the conductive layers to allow a top transparent conductive layer having separate regions 428, 428a to interconnect the diodes and the electrode 404 to form the ring diode structure in series with the electrode 404. The top conduc tive layer 428 not only serves to interconnect the diodes and the electrode 404, but in addition can also be used to form the row address lines. Also, since the conductive layer 428 is transparent, in cident light is permitted to impinge upon the upper diodes 408b and 410b. The pixel 400 further includes a top insula tive transparent plate 430 formed from glass, for example. The plate 430 carries on its inner sur face a second pixel electrode 432 and a column ad dress line 434. The electrode 432 and column ad dress line 434 can be formed from a transparent conductor such as indium tin oxide. The second electrode 432 is preferably the same size and shape as the first electrode 404 and aligned therewith. To complete the pixel 404, a light influenc ing material 436 such as liquid crystal material is disposed between the substrate 402 and the plate 430. The liquid crystal material can be, for example, nematic liquid crystal material. By the term light influencing material is meant any material which emits light or can be used to se lectively vary the intensity, phase, or polariza tion of light either being reflected from or transmitted through the material. Figure 22 illustrates an equivalent circuit diagram of the pixel 400 of Figures 20 and 21. As can there be noted, the pixel includes the column address line 434 and the row address line 428. The column address line 434 is coupled to the second pixel electrode 432 and the row address line 428 is coupled to the diodes 408b and 410a. The diodes 408b and 410a are coupled in series with diodes 408a and 410b respectively and to the row address line 428. The diodes 408a and 410b are also coupled to the first pixel electrode 404. Finally, disposed between the electrodes 404 and 432 is the liquid crystal material 436. The diodes 408a, 408b, 410a, and 410b provide isolation means for the pixel 400 in the form of a differentially biased ring diode when the pixel 400 is exposed to light indicated at P. The light is incident on diodes 408b and 410b which serve as photovoltaic devices to back bias diodes 408a and 410a respectively. As a result, increased drive voltages are required to operate the pixel 400 by virtue of the back biasing photodiodes. This is advantageous because the threshold for operating a display comprising a plurality of such pixels is sharpened as previously explained with respect to the dynamic memory embodiments disclosed herein. It will be understood that the present inven tion includes various alternate structures. For example, the bidirectional threshold devices may be formed as diode rings including p n junction diodes. It will be understood that any threshold device having a transfer function generally cor responding to those of Figure 3A and Figure 3B is within the scope of the invention. The threshold elements may be formed of amorphous silicon or germanium alloys. Additionally, it is within the scope of the invention to form capacitors in al ternate ways. For example, if desired, a capaci tor could be formed using a reverse biased diode and incorporated into the memory cell of the pres ent invention.
