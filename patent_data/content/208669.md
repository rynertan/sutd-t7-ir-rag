A silk screen printing machine having a reciprocatingly movable squeege arrangement adapted for printing in both directions and arranged to be passed over a stencil positioned over a material to receive print resting on a printing table, and in which machine a stencil frame is incorporated, characterized in that a frame assembly can be raised and lowred at one edge part of the printing table, and that said frame assembly can be raised and lowered at the other, opposing edge part of the printing table.

## Description
The present invention relates to a silk screen printing machine, and in particular to a silk screen printing machine of the kind provided with a reciprocatingly movable squeegee arrangement adapted to enable printing to be effected in both directions of squeegee travel, the squeegee arrangement being caused to move over a stencil placed over a print receiving material resting on a printing table, and in which a stencil frame is included in a frame assembly. Silk screen printers which incorporate a reciprocatingly movable squeegee arrangement adapted to effect printing in both directions are known to the art, and as an example of the earlier known technology in this respect reference is made to the arrangement described and illustrated in German Lay Out print 1 561 112. This lay out print describes a method of making an initial compensation for the expected total stencil stretch during a printing operation, and the stencil frame or the printing table is provided with guide means to this end. The stencil frame is arranged to be displaced axially with the aid of a mechanical device, to an extent corresponding to the total amount of stencil stretch expected, and is held firmly in this position. Thus, there is afforded the possibility of carrying out a printing sequence in each direction of movement of the squeegee arrangement, while at the same time making the necessary, although albeit inexact compensation for stencil stretch. The present invention can be said to take its starting point from the fundamental principles disclosed in the aforesaid German Lay Out Print. A silk screen printer capable of working in accordance with the basic principles of the present invention, however, requires a further combination stage. In the case of silk screen printing machines of the kind provided with a reciprocatingly movable squeegee arrangement which is adapted for printing in both directions of squeegee travel and which, with the aid of different known devices, is caused to move over a stencil placed over material which is to receive print and which rests on a printing table, there resides a qualified technical problem in providing conditions which enable a sufficiently large off contact angle to be obtained readily between the stencil and said material, irrespective of the direction in which printing takes place in response to movement of the squeegee arrangement. In the case of a silk screen printing machine which incorporates the fundamental features disclosed in the German Lay Out Print No. 1 561 112 and which is complemented with certain of the features disclosed in the U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,193,344, it will be understood that a further, highly qualified technical problem resides in the ability to perceive that the above mentioned technical problem can be solved by an arrangement in which the frame assembly described in the aforesaid U.S. patent specification can be raised and lowered at one edge part of the printing table, while at the other, opposing edge part of the printing table solely one of the assembly units can be raised and lowered, so as to provide thereby sufficient off contact between the stencil and the material, irrespective of the direction of movement of the squeegee arrangement. It will be seen that another technical problem resides in the provision of simple means which enable the frame assembly to be raised or lowered in dependence on the amount of off contact desired and the momentary position of the squeegee. In the case of silk screen printing machine in which measures have been taken to provide an off contact between sten cil and material of the aforesaid nature, a further technical problem resides in the provision of means for moving the stencil frame momentarily in steps along the printing table at the beginning of the squeegee travel in one printing direction, in order to compensate initially for stencil stretch, etc. It will be seen that a further technical problem in conjunction with such momentary axial displacement of the squeegee arrangement resides in the provision of means with which the off contact and stencil stretch can be adjusted in dependence on the position of the squeegee. Another technical problem is one of realizing that in the case of such constructions an important advantage is afforded when the squeegee arrangement comprises two mutually adjacent squeegees which are directed towards one another or angled relative to one another, of which squeegees one is intended for co action with the stencil in a first printing direction, while the other is intended for co action with the stencil in the opposite printing direction, which has for its purpose the elimination of complete displacement of the squeegee arrangement and an associated ink replenishing device along the full length of the stencil for the purpose of filling the fabric or cloth with silk screen ink or silk screen paste, since surplus paste remaining from a printing sequence in the first direction of displacement can be pushed back by the second squeegee arrangement without requiring an intermediate filling sequence, thereby providing conditions for preventing printing paste from passing through the stencil before the squeegee arrangement has pressed the paste therethrough. When manufacturing printed circuit cards in which the conductor array is located at a distance above the print carrier, there is also afforded the additional possibility of supplying printing paste on each side of the printed conductor array, by causing the squeegee arrangement to first move forward over the material to receive print and then to pass back over said material. Finally, a further technical problem is one of realizing that when the squeegee arrangement is arranged for forward movement along tracks parallel to the printing table, the squeegee arrangement shall present two mutually spaced wheels or rollers located on respective sides of the stencil frame, of which wheels or rollers one can be arranged to lie against one of the units in the first printing direction, while the other of said wheels or rollers can be arranged to lie against the other of said units in the second printing direction, these wheels or rollers contributing towards displacement of the different units of the frame assembly is a manner to achieve the aforesaid off contact, or release, at a given angle, and so as to compensate for stencil stretch in dependence on the position of the squeegee. In a silk screen printing machine of the kind which comprises a reciprocatingly movable squeegee arrangement adapted for printing in both directions of squeegee travel, in which the squeegee arrangement is passed or displaced over a stencil placed over a material to receive print resting on a printing table, and which further comprises a stencil frame, it is proposed in accordance with the invention that a frame assembly is capable of being raised and lowered at the one edge part of the printing table, and that said frame assembly can be raised or lowered at the other, opposing edge part of the printing table. It is suggested that the stencil frame is incorporated in a frame assembly comprising an outer unit and an inner unit, which are pivotally connected together at one edge part of the printing table. The two units of the frame assembly are capable of being raised and lowered together at one edge part of the printing table and that solely one of the units can be raised or lowered at the other, opposing edge part of the printing table. It is also proposed in acco rdance with the invention that there is provided a pneumatic piston cylinder device or like means effective to raise or to lower the units or unit to an extent dependent on a desired off contact angle and on the location of the squeegee, and that the piston cylinder device or like means is arranged to urge respective units towards means adapted for displacement of the squeegee, in order to obtain said off contact angle or to compensate for stencil stretch. In accordance with one advantageous embodiment of the invention, the edge part located at the point of origin of squeegee travel is arranged to be raised. Means are provided for effecting momentary and stepwise displacement of the stencil frame horizontally along the printing table in one travel direction of the squeegee arrangement, to enable an initial rough compensation to be made for stencil stretch. It also lies within the scope of the invention to obtain continuous compensation for stencil stretch in accordance with the principles illustrated and described in the U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,193,344. In accordance with one particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, the squeegee arrangement comprises two mutually adjacent squeegees which are directed towards one another and of which one squeegee is arranged to co act with the stencil in the first printing direction, while the other squeegee is arranged to co act with the stencil in the second, opposite printing direction. Finally, the squeegee arrangement is arranged to be moved along tracks extending parallel with the printing table, and includes two mutually spaced wheels or rollers located on a respective side of the stencil or the printing table, of which wheels or rollers one is arranged to lie against one of the units in the first printing direction, while the other of the wheels or rollers is arranged to lie against the other of the units in the second printing direction, and in that the abutment pressure between wheels and respective units is effected with the aid of piston cylinder devices or like means, with which the rotational position of the units in relation to each other is determined by the prevailing location of the squeegee during a printing sequence. Those advantages primarily characteristic of a silk screen printing machine constructed in accordance with the invention reside in the provision of conditions in which a reciprocatingly movable squeegee arrangement adapted for printing in both directions can be provided in an extremely simple manner, and in the creation of conditions for providing a satisfactory off contact angle and stencil stretch compensation, irrespective of the direction of travel of the squeegee arrangement relative to the stencil and printing table, and irrespective of the location of the squeegee along the stencil. The primary characteristic features of a silk screen printing machine according to the present invention are set forth in the characterizing of the following Claim 1. A preferred embodiment of a silk screen printing machine presenting characteristic features significant of the present invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which Figure 1 is an extremely simplified illustration in side view of a silk screen printing machine 1 provided with a reciprocatingly movable squeegee arrangement 2 for effecting printing in two directions, and also with means not shown for moving the squeegee arrangement over a stencil 3 stretched in a frame 4, which in turn is placed above material 5 to receive print and resting on a printing table 6. It is emphasized that the drawings are greatly simplified, so as to be able to illustrate clearly the significant features of the invention. Accordingly, the necessary drive means, registering means etc., have been omitted from the drawing, since the manner in which such means operate is obvious to one skilled in this art. In accordance with the invention a frame assembly incorporating the frame 4 comprises an outer unit 8 and an inner unit 9. In side view the units 8,9 are seen to lie behind one another, although the mutual positions of these units are shown more clearly in Figures 3, 5 and 6. The two units 8 and 9 are pivotally connected together, or hinged, at one edge part or end part 6a of the printing table, by means of a horizontally extending pivot shaft 10. Thus, it is not possible to raise or lower solely one unit in relation to the other, although it is possible in this case to raise and lower both units together, as described in more detail hereinafter. As shown in Figure 2, simultaneous raising or lowering of the frame assembly units 8,9 at one edge part or one end part 6a of the printing table is effected with the aid of a pneumatic piston cylinder device 11. The outer unit 8 is firmly connected to a shaft 10a at the other edge part 6b or end part 6b of the printing table and cannot be raised or lowered. Only one of the aforesaid units can be activated, namely the inner unit 9 can be raised and lowered at the other opposing edge part or end part 6b of the printing table, this being effected with the aid of a pneumatic piston cylinder device 12. As will be seen from Figures 2 and 3, the printing table is arranged to be lifted at that end thereof at which the squeegee begins to move, as illustrated by respective arrows P in said figures. Means 13 are also conveniently provided in accordance with the invention for stepwise and momentary displacement of the stencil frame 4 and the frame assembly units 8,9 along the printing table 6 in one direction of squeegee travel, in order to compensate for initial stretch in the stencil, among other things. One such means 13 is illustrated in Figure 4 and comprises basically two parts 13a, 13b, which can be moved axially in relation to one another by rotating a screw threaded sleeve 13c. In this was there is obtained a gap or clearance 13d, which can be adjusted for said displacement. The actual displacement is effected with the aid of a pneumatic piston cylinder device 14, illustrated in Figure 6, which acts on the outer unit 8. Turning again to Figures 2 and 3, it will be seen that the squeegee arrangement comprises two mutually adjacent squeegees 2a,2b which are directed towards one another and of which the one squeegee 2a co acts with the stencil 3 in the first printing direction, the direction shown by arrow P in Figure 2, while the other squeegee 2b co acts with the stencil 3 in the other, opposite printing direction, shown by the arrow P in Figure 3. The squeegee arrangement 2 is arranged to be displaced along tracks or guides w hich extend parallel with the printing table 6, and of which one referenced 15 is shown in Figure 1. The squeegee arrangement further comprises two mutually spaced wheels or rollers 16,17 located on a respective side of the stencil or printing table 6. One of the two rollers is arranged to lie against one of the units in the first printing direction, while the other of the two rollers is arranged to lie against the other of the units in the other printing direction. Thus, as shown in Figure 2, the roller or wheel 17 lies against a running surface 8a, while the roller or wheel 16 is free from any such surface. Figure 3 illustrates the other case in which the wheel or roller 16 rolls against a running surface 9a, while the wheel or roller 17 is free from any such surface. This arrangement enables the pneumatic piston cylinder device 11 or 12 to lift its respective end part of the frame assembly units in dependence on the position of the respective squeegee at a given time. The possibility of compensating for stencil stretch along the whole of the printing surface in dependence on the momentary position of the squeegee, as described extremely briefly here, is described in more detail in the aforementioned U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,193,344, particularly with regard to the embodiment illustrated in Figure 6. Figure 5 illustrates in perspective the one end part of the frame assembly and its units 8,9, and clearly shows that the two units 8,9 are joined together through the agency of the shaft 10 and can thus be raised together with the aid of the piston cylinder device 11, the extend to which the units can be lifted being controlled by the location of the wheel or roller 17. The frame assembly and the other end part of its units 8,9 are illustrated in Figure 6, from which it can be seen that solely the inner unit 9 can be brought to a raised position by the pneumatic piston cylinder device 12, the extent of lift being determined by the location of the wheel or roller 16. The wheels or rollers 16, 17 thus hold the units 8,9 in their correct positions for compensating prevailing stencil stretch. Thus, the wheels or rollers 16 and 17 hold the units 8,9 in a partially raised position and regulate the elevated position of the respective units in dependence on the location of the wheel or roller at a given time. It will be understood that the invention is not restricted to the aforedescribed and illustrated embodiment, and that modifications can be made within the scope of the following claims. It is thus clear to a man skilled in this art that the stencile may be attached to a single frame, which can be raised or lowered or moved horisontally in dependence of the stretch at respective edge portions, for example by tilting the piston assembly in such a way that a raising of one edge portion also causes an horisontal movement of the stencile.
