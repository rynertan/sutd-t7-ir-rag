# Knotter trip mechanism.

## Abstract
In a baler 10 having a plunger 20 reciprocating in a bale case 12 and knotters 96 for tying strands of twine around bales, two trip mechanisms 122, 128, 130, 190 136, 158, 192 186 are provided for automatic actuation of the knotters 96 . One trip mechanism 122, 128, 130, 190 186 is capable of preventing operation of the knotters 96 until a bale of desired length is formed. The other trip mechanism 136, 158, 192 186 is capable of preventing operation of the knotters 96 unless the plunger 20 is moving in a direction in the bale case to compress crop material into bales. The knotters 96 are part of the tying mechanism 96, 110 also including needles 110 . The tying mechanism drive speed exceeds the plunger drive speed in a manner such that the tying operation is completed during less than a full recip rocating cycle of the plunger 20 .
