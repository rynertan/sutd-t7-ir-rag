Thus, the trans isomer may be represented by the structure EMI5.2 and the cis isomer may be represented b the structure EMI6.1 wherein , R2 t R311 R4 x R5 , R6 and R7 represent hydrogen or methyl and Z represents the moieties having the structures EMI6.2 wherein R8 and Rg represent C1 C3 lower alkyl and 210 represents C1 C4 lower alkyl.When performing the process for preparing compounds useful in the practice of our invention where the use of a catalyst is required, the catalyst for the reaction may be an alkyl aluminum dihalide or a dialkyl aluminum halide for example RA1C12 of R2AlCl wherein R represents methyl, ethyl or n propyl or i propyl. The preferred catalyst is ethyl aluminum dichloride. Other Lewis acids such as aluminum trichloride, stannic chloride, zinc chloride, ferric chloride and titanium tetrachloride have been attempted to be used but such attempts have proved to be unsuccessful with minimal or no yields of product being produced.The temperature range of the reaction may vary from about 0 0C up to about 50 0C with ambient temperatures from 20 up to 30 C being preferred. The reaction pressure will not affect the yield but conveniently and economically, a reaction pressure of atmospheric is preferred. Thus, the catalyst for the reaction may be defined according to the formula Rm AlCln wherein R is C1 C3 alkyl and the sum, m n 3 with m being 1 or 2 and n being 1 or 2.The reaction mass resulting from the catalytic process is a mixture containing compounds substantially in its entirety compounds containing unsaturation in the norbornane moieties defined according to the generic structures EMI7.1 When performing the reaction for preparing compounds useful in the practice of our invention in the absence of catalysts that is where no catalyst is required , the reaction temperature is in the range of from about 1700C up to about 250 C with a temperature of 200 C being preferred. When the reaction is carried out at such high temperatures, the reaction is carried out under pressures greater than atmospheric in a closed pressurized system. The pressure of reaction may vary from about 10 psig up to about 10 psig depending on the vapor pressure of the reaction mass and depending upon a the temperature at which it is desired to carry out the reaction and b the time period over which the reaction is carried out. Thus, reaction pressures of between 10 psig and 100 psig will not in and of themselves affect the yield of product although too high a temperature of reaction will affect the yield of product in view of the higher degree of decomposition and too low a reaction temperature will affect the yield of product in that the reaction will take an inordinately long period of time in order to achieve a given desired yield.Thus, it appears that the optimum reaction temperature in the absence of catalyst is 2000C. Reaction temperatues below 170 C will not be high enough to effect the initiating decomposition of the dimethyl dicyclopentadiene starting material which it is most practical to use as a precursor of the dimethyl dicyclopentadiene.Depending upon the identity of the moiety represented as tt Z I, the reaction mass resulting from the thermal noncatalytic process may either be a mixture of compounds containing unsaturation in the norbornane moiety such as those defined according to the generic structures EMI8.1 EMI9.1 wherein R3, R4 and R10 are as defined above in the case of Z beiOR10 for example or a substantially pure isomer such as the case where Z is the structure EMI9.2 The above unsaturated compounds may be used as is for their individual organoleptic properties or mixtures of compounds may be used as is for their organoleptic properties or the compounds individually or in admixture may be further hydrogenated using hydrogen gas at super atmospheric pressures.When it is desired to use the compounds as is for their organoleptic properties, it is preferable in most cases to refine the reaction mass as by fractional distillation or high pressure liquid chromatography thereby creating one or more products usable as set forth above.When it is desired to carry out a hydrogenation, the hydrogenation is carried out preferably on mixtures of products containing compounds having unsaturation prepared by the above named Diels Alder reactions. Thus, when carrying out the hydrogenation on a mixture of products containing compounds resulting from the catalytic process and having the structures EMI10.1 wherein R3, R4 and Z are defined as above, compounds having the structures EMI10.2 will be produced.When carrying out the hydrogenation on, for example, a mixture of products containing the compounds resulting from the non catalytic, thermal process and having the structures EMI11.1 the compounds haying the structures EMI11.2 will be produced.In either case, it is preferable to carry out the hydro genation at pressures of from about 20 psig up to about 2,000 psig with a pressure range of from about 40 up to about 80 psig being preferred. It is also preferable for the reaction to be carried out in the presence of a catalyst such as Raney Nickel, palladium on carbon, palladium on calcium carbonate, palladium on barium sulfate and platinum. When using the palladium salt catalyst, it is preferred to use from about 3 up to about 12 palladium on salt, for example 5 palladium on calcium carbonate.Thus, the reaction sequence which is embodied within our invention when using the catalytic procedure may be illustrated as follows EMI12.1 wherein one of R3 or R4 is hydrogen and the other of R3 or R4 is methyl wherein R10 represents C1 C4 lower alkyl wherein Z represents one of the structures EMI13.1 wherein R8 or Rg represents C1 C3 lower alkyl and wherein m n 3 with m 1 or 2 and n 1 or 2.Furthermore, the reaction sequence when embodied within our invention when using the high temperature non catalyticDiels Alder reaction may be illustrated as follows EMI13.2 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 and Z are as defined above. a The formation of norbornyl esters wherein Z ORlo The novel substituted norbornyl ester derivatives of our invention useful as indicated supra may be produced by reacting a l methylcyclopentadiene or 2 methylcyclopentadiene having one of the structures EMI14.1 or a mixture of these methylcyclopentadienes defined according to the generic structure EMI14.2 with an alkyl acrylate derivative defined according to the generic structure EMI14.3 wherein one of R3 or R41 is methyl and the other of R3, or R41 is hydrogen and R101 represents C1 C4 alkyl in the presence of a specific Lewis acid catalyst at relatively low temperatures e.g., 0 50 C or in the absence of a catalyst at relatively high temperatures e.g., 170 250 C . When using the catalytic process of our invention, an isomer mix will be produced which contains isomers in proportions and in some cases having structures different from the proportions and in some cases structures produced using the high temperature reaction of our invention which reaction is carried out in the absence of catalyst .The reactant having the structure EMI15.1 represents a cis isomer or a trans isomer or a mixture of cis and trans isomers. Thus, the trans isomer may be represented by the structure EMI15.2 and the cis isomer may be represented by the structure EMI15.3 When performing the process for preparing compounds useful in the practice of our invention where the use of a catalyst is required, the catalyst for the reaction may be an alkyl aluminum dihalide or a dialkyl aluminum halide for example RAlCl2 or R2AlCl wherein R represents methyl, ethyl or n propyl or i propyl. The preferred catalyst is ethyl aluminum dichloride.Other Lewis acids such as aluminum trichloride, stannic chloride, zinc chloride, ferric chloride and titanium tetrachloride have been attempted to be used but such attempts have proved to be unsuccessful with minimal or no yields of product being produced. The temperature range of the reaction may vary from about 0 0C up to about 50 0C with ambient temperatures from 20 up to 30 C being preferred. The reaction pressure will not affect the yield but conveniently and economically a reaction pressure of atmospheric is preferred. Thus, the catalyst for the reaction may be defined according to the formula R AlCl wherein R is C1 C3 alkyl and the sum, m n 13 m n 3 with m being 1 or 2 and n being 1 or 2. The reaction mass resulting from the catalytic process is a mixture of compounds containing unsaturation in the norbornane moieties defined according to the generic structures EMI16.1 When performing the reaction for preparing compounds useful in the practice of our invention in the absence of catalysts that is where no catalyst is required , the reaction temperature is in the range of from about 170 0C up to about 250 C with a temperature of 200 C being pre ferred. When the reaction is carried out at such high temperatures, the reaction is carried out under pressures greater than atmospheric in a closed pressurized system.The pressure of reaction may vary from about 10 psig up to about 100 psig depending on the vapor pressure of the reaction mass and depending upon the temperature at which it is desired to carry out the reaction. Thus, a reaction pressure of between 10 psig and 100 psig will not in and of themselves affect the yield of product although too high a temperature of reaction will affect the yield of product in view of the higher degree of decomposition and too low a reaction temperature will affect the yield of product in that the reaction will take an inordinately long period of time in order to achieve a given yield.Thus, it appears that the optimum reaction temperature in the absence of catalyst is 200 C. Reaction temperatures below 170 C will not be high enough to effect the initiating decomposition of the dimethyl dicyclopentadiene starting material which is the most practical to use as a precursor of the dimethyl dicyclopentadiene.The reaction mass resulting from the thermal non catalytic process is also a mixture of compounds containing unsaturation in the norbornane moiety defined according to the generic structures EMI17.1 EMI18.1 wherein R3, R4 and R5 are as defined above.The above unsaturated compounds may be used as is for their individual organoleptic properties or mixtures of compounds may be used as is for their organoleptic properties or the compounds individually or in admixture may be further hydrogenated using hydrogen gas at super atmospheric pressures. When it is desired to use the compounds as is for their organoleptic properties, it is preferable to refine the reaction mass as by fractional distillation or high pressure liquid chromatography thereby creating one or more products usable as set forth above.When it is desired to carry out a hydrogenation, the hydrogenation is carried out preferably on mixtures of products containing compounds having unsaturation prepared by the above named Diels Alder reactions. Thus, when carrying out the hydrogenation on a mixture of products containing compounds resulting from the catalytic process and having the structures EMI18.2 wherein R3, R4 and R5 are defined as above, compounds having the structures EMI19.1 will be produced.When carrying out the hydrogenation on a mixture of products containing the compounds resulting from the noncatalytic, thermal process and having the structures EMI19.2 the compounds having the structures EMI19.3 EMI20.1 will be produced.In either case, it is preferable to carry out the hydrogenation at pressures of from about 20 psig up to about 2,000 psig with a pressure range of from about 40 up to about 80 psig being preferred. It is also preferable for the reaction to be carried out in the presence of a catalyst such as Raney Nickel, palladium on carbon, palladium on calcium carbonate, palladium on barium sulfate and platinum. When using the palladium salt catalyst, it is preferred to use from about 3 up to about 12 palladium salt, for example 5 palladium on calcium carbonate.Thus, the reaction sequence which is embodied within our invention when using the catalytic procedure may be illustrated as follows EMI21.1 wherein one of R3 or R4 is hydrogen and the other of R3 or R4 is methyl wherein R10 represents C1 C4 lower alkyl wherein R represents C1 C3 alkyl and wherein m n 3 with m being equal to 1 or 2 and n being equal to 1 or 2.Furthermore, the reaction sequence which is embodied within our invention when using the high temperature non catalytic thermal Diels Alder reaction may be illustrated as follows EMI22.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 and R10 are as defined above.

The products of the reaction are compounds having the generic structures EMI35.2 wherein R2 is methyl or ethyl.The resulting products can be used in admixture for their organoleptic properties or they can be separated as by fractional distillation to yield pure materials which can be used for their organo leptic properties or the mixture can be used for further reaction with hydrogen to form the mixture of compounds having the structures EMI36.1 or the separated compounds may be individually hydrogenated to form the corresponding hydrogenated materials having the structures EMI36.2 When the compounds having the structures EMI36.3 are hydrogenated, it is preferable to carry out the hydrogenation at a pressure between 25 psig and 100 psig, with a pressure of about 50 psig being most preferable.It is also preferred to carry out the hydrogenation at a temperature of between about 15OC and about 50 C, with ambient temperatures, e.g., 25 3OOC being most preferable.Furthermore, the time of reaction is a function of the maximum amount of hydrogen absorption taking place thus, when a hydrogen pressure of 50 psig is used and a temperature of 250C is used in the reaction, the time of maximum absorption is 5.5 hours.The catalyst used in the hydrogenation may either beRaney Nickel or a supported palladium catalyst such as palladium on carbon or palladium on calcium carbonate.When the supported catalyst is used in the hydrogenation reaction, it is preferred to use from about 3 up to about 10 by weight palladium on support, preferably about 5 palladium on, for example, carbon or calcium carbonate.At the end of the reaction, the reaction product is fractionally distilled to yield fractions containing at least one compound generically defined according to the structure EMI37.1 wherein one of R1 or R3, is methyl and the other is hydrogen, and wherein R2 is methyl or hydrogen. These compounds can be further separated into their respective stereoisomers by reacting the corresponding aldehyde with a dextro or laevo amine and then, either fractionally distilling or fractionally crystallizing the resultant stereoisomers followed by subsequent hydrolysis. c The amides whereinEMI38.1 The novel substituted norbornane derivatives of our invention useful as indicated supra, may be produced by reacting a 1 methylcyclopentadiene or 2 methylcyclopentadiene having one of the structures EMI38.2 or a mixture of these methylcyclopentadienes defined according two the generic structure EMI38.3 with an alkyl acrylamide derivative defined according to the generic structure EMI38.4 Generically, the methylcyclopentadiene derivative structures may be indicated by the generic structure EMI39.1 The substituted acrylamide structure represents a cis isomer or a trans isomer, or a mixture of cis and trans isomers.Thus, the trans isomer may be represented by the structure EMI39.2 and the cis isomer may be represented by the structure EMI39.3 The Diels Alder reaction may be carried out using a specific Lewis acid catalyst at low temperatures e.g., 0 500C or in the absence of a catalyst, at elevated temperatures e.g., 170 2500C . Different isomers and proportions of isomers are produced depending on whether a catalytic reaction is carried out or a non catalytic thermalDiels Alder reaction is carried out as will be seen in the examples and subsequent paragraphs, infra.Thus, when it is desired to carry out a catalytic DielsAlder reaction, the catalyst for this reaction may be an alkyl aluminum dihalide or a dialkyl aluminum halide for example, RAlCl2 or R2AlCl wherein R represents methyl, ethyl or n propyl or i propyl. The preferred catalyst is ethyl aluminum dichloride. Other Lewis acids such as aluminum trichloride, stannic chloride, zinc chloride, ferric chloride and titanium tetrachloride have been attempted to be used but such attempts have proved to be unsuccessful with minimal or no yields in the product being produced. The temperature range of the reaction may vary from about OOC up to about 50 0C with ambient temperatures from 20 up to 30 C being preferred. The reaction pressure will not affect the yield, but conveniently and economically, a reaction pressure of atmospheric is preferred.Thus, the catalyst for the reaction may be defined according to the formula EMI40.1 wherein R is C1 C3 alkyl and the sum, n n 3, with m being 1 or 2 and n being 1 or 2. The resulting reaction mass is a mixture of compounds containing unsaturation in the norbornane moiety defined according to the generic structure EMI41.1 These compounds may be used as is for their organoleptic properties or the mixture of compounds may be further hydrogenated using hydrogen gas at supra atmospheric pressures. When it is desired to use the compounds as is , for their organoleptic properties, it is preferable to refine the reaction mass as by fractional distillation thereby creating a product usable as set forth above.When the hydrogenation is carried out on a mixture of compounds containing compounds having the structures defined according to the genus EMI41.2 compounds containing the structures EMI42.1 will be produced. It is preferable to carry out the hydrogenation at pressures of from about 20 psig up to about 2000 psig with a pressure range of from about 40 up to about 80 psig being preferred. It is also preferable for the reaction to be carried out in the presence of a catalyst such as Raney nickel, palladium on carbon, palladium on calcium carbonate, palladium on barium sulfate, and platinum. When using the palladium salt catalyst, it is preferred to use from about 3 up to about 12 palladium on salt, for example 5 palladium on calcium carbonate.The reaction sequence including the catalytic Diels Alder reaction which is embodied within our invention is generically set forth as follows EMI42.2 EMI43.1 wherein R2 is methyl or hydrogen R6 is methyl or hydrogen R1, R3 or R7 represent methyl or hydrogen, with the proviso that one of R1, R3 and R7 represent methyl and the other two of R1, R3 and R7 represent hydrogen wherein R4 and R5 are the same or different and each represents hydrogen orC1 C3 lower alkyl.When it is desired to carry out the thermal non catalyticDiels Alder reaction, the reaction takes place at temperatures of between 179 0C and 2500C at elevated pressures in order to prevent the constituents of the reaction mass from evaporating. Too low a temperature of reaction will either give rise to inordinately long times of reaction, yields which are not commercially feasible since they are too loan, or no reaction at all. However, temperatures above 250 C are considered too high in that although the reaction is speeded up, the high temperature gives rise to an uncontrollable reaction and decomposition of reaction product which further gives rise to separation problems when attempting to obtain the substantially pure reaction product usable for its organoleptic properties.It has also been found that when carrying out the thermal reaction in certain instances, this reaction is surprisingly, unexpectedly, unobviously and advantageously more specific than the low temperature catalytic Diels Alder reaction. Thus, when reacting the methylcyclopentadiene dimer mixture with dimethylacrylamide according to the reaction sequence EMI44.1 the reaction product having the structure EMI44.2 is produced without producing any other isomers thereof.This reaction product is the endo isomer of a specific isomeric product that would be expected to be one of many reaction products but that is, in fact, the only isomer produced.Notwithstanding the foregoing statement, however, both the catalytic Diels Alder reaction and the non catalytic thermal Diels Alder reaction, as a general rule, give rise to mixtures of isomers albeit different mixtures of isomers in different proportions.When the norbornane derivatives of our invention are used as food flavor adjuvans, the nature of the co ingredients included with each of the said norbornane derivatives in formulating the product composition will also serve to alter, modify, augment or enhance the organoleptic characteristics of the ultimate foodstuff treated therewith.As used herein in regard to flavors, the terms alter , modify and augment in their various forms mean supplying or imparting flavor character or note to otherwise bland, relatively tasteless substances or augmenting the existing flavor characteristic where a natural flavor is deficient in some regard or supplementing the existing flavor impression to modify its quality, character or taste .The term enhance is used herein to mean the intensification of a flavor or aroma characteristic or note without the modification of the quality thereof. Thus, enhancement of a flavor or aroma means that the enhancement agent does not add any additional flavor note.As used herein, the term foodstuff includes both solid and liquid ingestible materials which usually do, but need not, have nutritional value. Thus, foodstuffs include soups, convenience foods, beverages, dairy products, candies,vegetables, cereals, soft drinks, snacks and the like.As used herein, the term medicinal product includes both solids and liquids which are ingestible non toxic materials which have medicinal value such as cough syrups, cough drops, aspirin and chewable medicinal tablets.The term chewing gum is intended to mean a composition which comprises a substantially water insoluble, chewable plastic gum base such as chicle, or substitutes therefor, including jelutong, guttakay, rubber or certain comestible natural or synthetic resins cr waxes. Incorporated with the gum base in admixture therewith may be plasticizers of softening agents, e.g., glycerine and a flavor composition which incorporates one or more of the norbornane derivatives of our invention, and in addition, sweetening agents which may be sugars, including sucrose or dextrose and or artificial sweeteners such as cyclamates or saccharin.Other optional ingredients may also be present.Substances suitable for use herein as co ingredients or flavoring adjuvants are well known in the art for such use, being extensively described in the relevant literature. It is a requirement that any such material be ingestibly acceptable and thus non toxic and otherwise nondeleterious particularly from an organoleptic standpoint whereby the ultimate flavor and or aroma of the consumable material used is not caused to have unacceptable aroma and taste nuances. Such materials may in general be characterized as flavoring adjuvants or vehicles comprising broadly stabilizers, thickeners, surface active agents, conditioners, other flavorants and flavor intensifiers.Stabilizer compounds include preservatives, e.g., sodium chloride antioxidants, e.g., calcium and sodium ascorbate, ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxyanisole mixture of 2 and 3 tertiary butyl 4 hydroxyanisole , butylated hydroxytoluene 2,6 di tertiary butyl 4 methylphenol , propyl gallate and the like and sequestrants, e.g., citric acid. Thickener compounds include carriers, binders, protective colloids, suspending agents, emulsifiers and the like, e.g., agar agar, carrageenan cellulose and cellulose derivatives such as carboxymethyl cellulose and methyl cellulose natural and synthetic gums such as gum arabic, gum tragacanth gelatin, proteinaceous materials lipids carbohydrates starches, pectins and emulsifiers, e.g., mono and diglycerides of fatty acids, skim milk powder, hexoses, pentoses, disac,charides, e.g., sucrose corn syrup and the like. Surface active agents includes emulsifying agents, e.g., fatty acids such as capric acid, caprylic acid, palmitic acid, myristic acid and the like, mono and diglycerides of fatty acids, lecithin, defoaming and flavor dispersing agents such as sorbitan monostearate, potassium stearate, hydrogenated tallow alcohol and the like.Conditioners include compounds such as bleaching and maturing agents, e.g., benzoyl peroxide, calcium peroxide, hydrogen peroxide and the like starch modifiers such as peracetic acid, sodium chlorite, sodium hypochlorite, propylene oxide, succinic anhydride and the like, buffers and neutralizing agents, e.g., sodium acetate, ammonium bicarbonate, ammonium phosphate, citric acid, lactic acid, vinegar and the like colorants, e.g., carminic acid, cochineal, tumeric and curcuma and the like firming agents such as aluminum sodium sulfate, calcium chloride and calcium gluconate texturizers, anti caking agents, e.g., aluminum calcium sulfate and tri basic calcium phosphate enzymes, yeast foods, e.g., calcium lactate and calcium sulfate nutrient supplements, e.g., iron salts such as ferric phosphate, ferrous gluconate and the like, riboflavin, vitamins, zinc sources such as zinc chloride, zinc sulfate and the like.Other flavorants and flavor intensifiers include aldehydes, esters, natural oils, alcohols, sulfides, ketones, lactones, carboxylic acids and hydrocarbons such as heliotropin, terpinenol 4, benzaldehyde, anisaldehyde, phenyl acetaldehyde, benzyl formate, benzyl acetate, cis 3 hexenyl benzoate, methyl hexanoate, hexanal, eucalyptol, eugenol, acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, turpentine gum oil, limonene, gum camphor, isobornyl acetate, borneol, cinnamic aldehyde, cuminic aldehyde, furfural, methyl cinnamate, cassia oil, vanillin, maltol, parahydroxybenzyl acetate, dimethyl sulfide, alphaionone, acetic acid, isobutyl acetate, acetone, butyric acid, formic acid, valeric acid, amyl acetate, amyl butyrate, anethol, benzyl salicylate, diacetyl, dimethyl anthranilate, ethyl methylphenylglycidate, ethyl succinate, ethyl valerate, geraniol, cis 3 hexen l ol, 2 hexenyl acetate, 2 hexenyl butyrate, hexyl butyrate, 4 p hydroxyphenyl 2 butanone, beta ionone, isobutyl cinnamate, jasmine, lemon essential oil, methyl butyrate, methyl caproate, methyl disulfide, methyl p naphthyl ketone, orris butter, rose absolute, terpenyl acetate, gamma undecalactone, vanilla and alcohol.The specific flavoring adjuvant selected for use may be either solid or liquid depending upon the desired physical form of the ultimate product, i.e., foodstuff, whether simulated or natural, and should, in any event, i be organoleptically compatible with the norbornane derivatives of our invention by not covering or spoiling the organoleptic properties aroma and or taste thereof ii be non reactive with the norbornane derivatives of our invention and iii be capable of providing an environment in which the norbornane derivatives can be dispersed or admixed to provide a homogeneous medium. In addition, selection of one or more flavoring adjuvants, as well as the quantities thereof will depend upon the precise organoleptic character desired in the finished product.Thus, in the case of flavoring compositions, ingredient selection will vary in accordance with the foodstuff, chewing gum, medicinal product or toothpaste to which the flavor and or aroma are to be imparted, modified, altered or enhanced.In contradistinction, in the preparation of solid products, e.g., simulated foodstuffs, ingredients capable of providing normally solid compositions should be selected such as various cellulose derivatives.As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the amount of norbornane derivatives employed in a particular instance can vary over a relatively wide range, depending upon the desired organoleptic effects to be achieved. Thus, correspondingly, greater amounts would be necessary in those instances wherein the ultimate food composition to be flavored is relatively bland to the taste, whereas relatively minor quantities may suffice for purposes of enhancing the composition merely deficient in natural flavor or aroma. The primary requirement is that the amount selected to be effective, e.i., sufficient to alter, modify, or enhance the organoleptic characteristics of the parent composition, whether foodstuff per se, chewing gum, per se, medicinal product per se, toothpaste per se, or flavoring composition.The use of insufficient quantities of norbornane derivatives will, of course, substantially vitiate any possibility of obtaining the desired results while excess quantities prove needlessly costly and, in extreme cases, may disrupt the flavor aroma balance, thus proving selfdefeating. Accordingly, the terminology t effective amount and sufficient amount is to be accorded a significance in the context of the present invention consistent with the obtention of desired flavoring effects.Thus, and with respect to ultimate food compositions, chewing gum compositions, medicinal product compositions and toothpaste compositions, it is found that quantities of norbornane derivatives ranging from a small but effective amount, e.g., 0.01 parts per million up to about 100 parts per million based on total composition are suitable.Concentrations in excess of the maximum quantity stated are not normally recommended, since they fail to prove commensurate enhancement of organoleptic properties. In those instances, wherein the norbornane derivatives are added to the foodstuff as an integral component of a flavoring composition, it is, of course, essential that the total quantity of flavoring composition employed be sufficient to yield an effective norbornane derivative concentration in the foodstuff product. Food flavoring compositions prepared in accordance with the present invention preferably contain the norbornane derivatives in concentrations ranging from about 0.01 up to about 15 by weight based on the total weight of the said flavoring composition.The composition described herein can be prepared according to conventional techniques well known as typified by cake batters and fruit drinks and can be formulated by merely admixing the involved ingredients within the proportions stated in a suitable blender to obtain the desired consistency, homogeneity of dispersion, etc. Alternatively, flavoring compositions in the form of particulate solids can be conveniently prepared by mixing the norbornane derivatives with, for example, gum arabic, gum tragacanth, carrageenan and the like, and thereafter spray drying the resultant mixture whereby to obtain the particular solid product. Prepared flavor mixes in powder form e.g., a fruit flavored powder mix are obtained by mixing the dried solid components, e.g., starch, sugar and the like and norbornane derivatives in a dry blender until the requisite degree of uniformity is achieved. It is presently preferred to combine with the norbornane derivatives of our invention, the following adjuvants Heliotropin Terpinenol 4 Benzaldehyde Anisaldehyde Phenylacetaldehyde Benzyl formate Benzyl acetate Cis 3 hexenyl benzoate Methyl hexanoate Hexanal Eucalyptol Eugenol Acetaldehyde Ethyl acetate Ethyl butyrate Turpentine gum oil Limonene Gum camphor Isobornyl acetate Borneoi Cinnamic aldehyde Cuminic aldehyde Furfural Methyl cinnamate Cassia oil Vanillin Malto Paranydroxyserzylacetone Dimethyl sulfide Alpha ionone Acetic acid Isobutyl acetate Acetone Butyric acid Formic acid Valeric acid Amyl acetate Amyl butyrate Anethol Benzyl salicylate Diacetyl Dimethyl anthranilate Ethyl methylphenylglycidate Ethyl succinate Ethyl valerate Geraniol Cis 3 hexen 1 ol 2 Hexenyl acetate 2 Hexenyl butrate Hexyl butyrate 4 p Hydroxyphenyl 2 butanone Beta ionone Isobutyl cinnamate Jasmine Lemon essential oil Methyl butyrate Methyl capronate Methyl disulfide Methyl p r.aphthyl ketone Orris butter Rose absolute Terpenyl acetate Ganuna unuecalactone Vanilla ana Alcohol.An additional aspect of our invention provides an organoleptically improved smoking tobacco product and additives therefor, as well as methods of making the same which overcome problems theretofore encountered in which desired spicy, cooling, clove like, cinnamon bark like, sweet, fruity, berry like, juicyfruit woody, piney, blueberry, banana, green, herbaceous, strawberry like, and dill flavor characteristics of natural tobacco prior to smoking and on smoking in the mainstream and in the sidestream as well as cooling effects, are created or enhanced or modified or augmented and may be readily controlled and maintained at the desired uniform level regardless of variations in the tobacco components of the blend.This invention further provides improved tobacco additives and methods whereby various desirable natural aromatic tobacco flavoring characteristics with spicy, cooling, clove like, cinnamon bark like, sweet, fruity, berry like, juicyfruit, woody, piney, blueberry, banana, green, herbaceous, strawberry like and dill notes may be imparted to smoking tobacco products and may be readily varied and controlled to produce the desired uniform flavoring characteristics.In carrying out this aspect of our invention, we add to smoking tobacco materials or a suitable substitute therefor e.g., dried lettuce leaves an aroma and flavor additive containing as an active ingredient one or more norbornane derivatives of our invention.In addition to the norbornane derivatives of our invention other flavoring and aroma additives may be added to the smoking tobacco material or substitute therefor either separately or in mixture with the norbornane derivatives as follows I.

Natural oils Celery seed oil Coffee extract Bergamot oil Cocoa extract Nutmeg oil and Origanum oilAn.aroma and flavoring concentrate containing one or more norbornane derivatives of our invention and, if desired, one or more of the above indicated additional flavoring additives may be added to the smoking tobacco material, to the filter or to the leaf or paper wrapper. The smoking tobacco material may be shredded, cured, cased and blended tobacco material or reconstituted tobacco material or tobacco substitutes e.g., lettuce leaves or mixtures thereof.The proportions of flavoring additives may be varied in accordance with taste but insofar as enhancement or the imparting of spicy and or cooling and or clove like and or cinnamon bark iike and or sweet and or fruity and or berry like and or juicyfruit and or woody and or piney and or blueberry and or banana and or green and or herbaceous and or strawberry like and or dill notes, we have found that satisfactory results are obtained if the proportion by weight of the sum total of norbornane derivative s to smoking tobacco material is between 50 ppm and 1,500 ppm 0.0158 0.15 . We have further found that satisfactory results are obtained if the proportions by weight of the sum total of norbornane derivative used to flavoring material is between 1,500 and 15,000 ppm 0.15 1.5 .Any convenient method for incorporating the norbornane derivative s into the tobacco product may be employed.Thus, the norbornane derivative s taken alone or along with other flavoring additives may be dissolved in a suitable solvent such as ethanol, diethyl ether and or volative organic solvents and the resulting solution may either be spread on the cured, cased and blended tobacco material or the tobacco material maybe dipped into such solution.Under certain circumstances, a solution of the norbornane derivative s taken alone or taken further together with other flavoring additives as set forth above, may be applied by means of a suitable applicator such as a brush or roller on the paper or leaf wrapper for the smoking product, or it may be applied to the filter by either spraying, or dipping, or coating.Furthermore, it will be apparent that only a portion of the tobacco or substitute therefor need be treated and the thus treated tobacco may be blended with other tobaccos before the ultimate tobacco product is formed.In such cases, the tobacco treated by have the norbornane derivative s in excess of the amounts or concentrations above indicated so that when blended with other tobaccos, the final product will have the percentage within the indicated range.In accordance with one specific example of our invention an aged, cured and shredded domestic burley tobacco is sprayed with a 20 ethanol solution of the mixture of 1,3and 3,5 dimethyl 2 norbornane carboxylic acid methyl esters having the structures EMI56.1 in an amount of mixture to provide tobacco composition containing 800 ppm by weight of the mixture of the two esters on a dry basis. Thereafter the alcohol is removed by evaporation and the tobacco is manufactured into cigarettes by the usual techniques. The cigarette when treated as indicated has a desired and pleasing aroma which is detectable in the mainstream and the sidestream when the cigarette is smoked. This aroma is described as being sweeter, more aromatic, more tobacco like having sweet, spicy, cooling, woody and clove like notes. In accordance with a second specific example of our invention an aged, cured and shredded domestic burley tobacco is sprayed with a 20 ethanol solution of the compound having the structure EMI57.1 in an amount of mixture to provide tobacco composition containing 800 ppm by weight of the mixture of the amide on a dry basis. Thereafter the alcohol is removed by evaporation and the tobacco is manufactured into cigarettes by the usual techniques. The cigarette when treated as indicated has a desired and pleasing aroma which is detectable in the mainstream and the sidestream when the cigarette is smoked. This aroma is described as being sweeter, fruity, more aromatic, more tobacco like, having sweet, fruity notes.While our invention is particularly useful in the manufacture of smoking tobacco, such as cigarette tobacco, cigar tobacco and pipe tobacco, other tobacco products, formed from sheeted tobacco dust or fines may also be used.Likewise, the norbornane derivative s of our invention can be incorporated with materials such as filter tip materials e.g., cellulose acetate filters wherein spicy, cooling, clove like, cinnamon bark like, sweet, fruity, berry like, juicyfruit, woody, piney, blueberry, banana, green, herbaceous, strawberry like and or dill effects are desired , seam paste, packaging materials and the like which are used along with tobacco to form a product adapted for smoking. Furthermore, the norbornane derivative s can be added to certain tobacco substitutes of natural or synthetic origin e.g., dried lettuce leaves and, accordingly, by the term tobacco as used throughout this specification is meant any composition intended for human consumption by smoking or otherwise, whether composed of tobacco plant parts or substitute materials or both.The norbornane derivative s and one or more auxiliary perfume ingredients, including, for example, hydrocarbons, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, nitriles, esters, lactones or cyclic esters, synthetic essential oils and natural essential oils, may be admixed so that the combined odors of the individual components produce a pleasant and desired fragrance, particularly and preferably in fruity, banana, creamy, camphoraceous, herbaceous, strawberry like, raspberry like, reseda body like, sweet, spicy, woody, eucalyptol like, tagett like, rum butterscotch, balsamic, green, and or minty fragrances.Such perfume compositions usually contain a the main note or the bouquet or foundation stone of the composition b modifiers which round off and accompany the main note c fixatives which include odorous substances which lend a particular note to the perfume throughout all stages of evaporation and substances which retard evaporation and d topnotes which are usually low boiling fresh smelling materials.In perfume compositions, it is the individual components which contribute to their particular olfactory characteristics, however the overall sensory effect of the perfume composition will be at least the sum total of the effects of each of the ingredients. Thus, one or more of the norbornane derivative s of our invention can be used to alter, modify or enhance the aroma characteristics of a perfume composition, for example, by utilizing or moderating the olfactory reaction contributed by another ingredient in the composition. The amount of norbornane derivative s of our invention which will be effective in perfume compositions as well as perfumed articles and colognes depends on many factors, including the other ingredients, their amounts and the effects which are desired. It has been found that perfume compositions containing as little as 0.01 of norbornane derivative s or even less e.g., 0.005 can be used to impart a fruity, banana, creamy, camphoraceous, strawberry like, raspberry like, reseda body like, herbaceous, sweet, spicy, woody, eucalyptol like, rum butterscotch, balsamic, green, spearmint, caraway, basil, powdery, castoreum like, anise, minty, cut grass like, borneollike, tagette like and or medicinal odor with camphor, apple like, herbaceous, minty and calamnus like nuances to soaps, detergents including anionic, nonionic, cationic and zwitterionic solid or liquid detergents , cosmetics, fabric softeners, dryer added fabric softener articles, fabric whiteners and optical brighteners or other products.The amount employed can range up to 70 of the fragrance components and will depend on considerations of cost, nature of the end product, the effect desired on the finished product and the particular fragrance sought.The norbornane drivative s of our invention are useful taken alone or together with other ingredients in perfume compositions in detergents and soaps, space odorants and deodorants, perfumes, colognes, toilet water, bath preparations, such as lacquers, brilliantines, pomades and shampoos cosmetic preparations, such as creams, deodorants, hand lotions and sun screens powders such as talcs, dusting powders, face powders and the like.As little as 0.005 of the norbornane derivative s in the ultimate perfumed article will suffice to impart an intense, fruity, banana, creamy, camphoraceous, strawberry like, raspberrylike, reseda body like, herbaceous, sweet, spicy, woody, eucalyptol like, rum butterscotch, balsamic, green, spearmint, caraway, basil, powdery, castoreum like, anise, minty, cut grass like, borneol like, tagette like and or medicinal note to various types of perfumed articles.Generally no more than 3 of the norbornane derivative s based on the ultimate end product perfumed article is required.In addition, the perfume composition or fragrance composition of our invention can contain a vehicle, or carrier for the norbornane derivative s . The vehicle can be a liquid such as a non toxic alcohol, 2 non toxic glycol or the like. The carrier can also be an absorbent solid, such as a gum e.g., gum arabic , or components for encapsulating the composition such as gelatin .It will thus be apparent that the norbornane derivative s of our invention can be utilized to alter, modify or enhance sensory properties, particularly organoleptic properties such as flavor s and or fragrance s of a wide variety of consumable materials.The following examples serve to illustrate processes for specifically producing the norbornane derivative s useful in our invention.The following examples also serve to illustrate specific embodiments of our invention.It will be understood that these examples are illustrative and the invention is to be considered to be restricted thereto only as indicated in the appended claims.All parts and percentages given herein are by weight unless otherwise specified.

Half of the cigarettes are then treated with 500 to 1,500 ppm of one of the following norbornyl derivatives of Table XI as follows Table XIA.Product produced according to Example II, bulked fractions 4 6 consisting of the compounds having the structures EMI142.1 B. Composition of matter produced according to ExampleIII bulked fractions 7 and 8 consisting of the compounds having the structures EMI142.2 The control cigarettes not containing the norbornyl derivatives as set forth in Table XI and the experimental cigarettes which contain the norbornyl derivatives as set forth in Table XI are evaluated by paired comparison and the results are as follows The experimental cigarettes are found, on smoking, to have a sweeter, spicy, woody oriental, clove like taste with much more body and much more natural tobacco like aroma prior to smoking and on smoking in the mainstream and the sidestream. The experimental cigarettes containing the product produced according to Example II in addition have cooling nuances.The experimental cigarettes produced containing the product produced according to Example III also have cinnamon bark nuances prior to and on smoking in the mainstream and in the sidestream.All cigarettes are evaluated for smoke flavor with a 20 mm cellulose acetate filter.Accordingly, it is concluded that the norbornyl derivatives set forth in Table XI produced according to the processes of Examples II and III enhance the tobacco like taste and aroma particularly the oriental like taste of the blended cigarette imparting to it sweet, spicy and woody oriental tobacco like nuances and in addition clove like nuances.Example XXIXThe following is a description of a preferred embodiment of the invention as carried out using a process wherein minute capsules having a diameter in the range of 50 up to 500 microns were added to a wet web of reconstituted tobacco weight ratio of dry web to dry capsules 1 0.04 .The capsules and binder materials weight ratio of dry capsule to dry binder 1 0.1 when placed among the tobacco fibers, wet them and entangle with them and clothe them, thus in effect securing and binding the capsules against migration through the sheet, thereby forming a subsident stratum. The majority of binder and associated capsules are caught in the sheet. Substantially no capsules migrate through the sheet. When the wet tobacco web is dried, the binder shrinks by loss of solvent, leaving the dried polymeric binder material, and the capsules remain in place relatively with respect to sheet thickness.The sheets containing the capsules are then shredded and used in producing smoking articles such as cigarettes.Such cigarettes are f 5rmed using a wrapper, containing a fill of tobacco extending from one end of the wrapper to the other, and into telly admixed with the tobacco, a plurality of microcapsules each comprising an aromatic volatile synthetic clove oil flavorant. The capsules are homogeneously spaced in contiguous relationship with the tobacco such that as the burning front of the tobacco advances the length of the tobacco article, a concomitant elevation of temperature initiates consecutive rupture of the capsules 1 releasing the volatile synthetic clove oil containing material which emanates with smoke from the smoking article into the smoker s mouth and 2 yielding a crackling sound audible to the human ear.Tragacanth gum solution and starch solution were prepared in the following manner Part AConcentrated tragacanth gum solution binder 4.5 pounds of dry tragacanth gum powder were stirred into 50 gallons of water, using a suitable mixer. Five minutes after all the powder had been added, the mixer was turned off. The tragacanth gum solution was allowed to stir for 2 hours, and then the mixer was turned on for 5 minutes.Sitting for 2 additional hours, enabled the tragacanth gum to hydrate. After five minutes, the mixer was turned off, and the 55 gallon drum was covered. Just prior to combining the tragacanth gum solution and the capsular slurry, 50 gallons of tragacanth gum solution was diluted with water to 3 percent tragacanth gum on a solids basis. Part BStarch solutionThe hydrolyzed starch solution was prepared by heating a slurry of the starch at 1900F for a minimum of 15 minutes to provide a 1 by weight starch in water solution.Capsule slurries were prepared in the following manner Part C Preparation of synthetic clove oilA mixture is prepared containing the following ingredients Ingredient Percentage a caryophyllene 2.0B caryophyllene 2.0 y caryophyllene 10.0Furfural 0.1Eugenol 65.0Eugenyl acetate 5.0Acetyl eugenols 5.9Norbornol derivatives as follows A. Product produced according to 5.0 Example II, bulked fractions 4 6 consisting of the compounds having the structures EMI145.1 B. Composition of matter produced 5.0 according to Example III bulked fractions 7 and 8 consisting of the compounds having the structures EMI145.2 EMI146.1 Part DPreparation of capsular slurry encapsulation of synthetic clove oilTen grams of gum arabic were dissolved at room temperature in 220 grams of deionized water. The mixture was agitated until the gum arabic was fully dissolved.In a separate 240 milliliter Erlenmeyer flask, 10.0 grams of modified gelatin was mixed with 220.0 grams of deionized water.The gelatin was allowed to tumefy at room temperature and also then warmed in a water bath to about 400C with stirring so that the gelatin was dissolved.The gelatin solution and the gum arabic solution were poured into a beaker equipped with a stirrer. A flocculence indicating the precipitation of the gelatin was noted. The temperature of the mixture was decreased to 350C. The speed of the stirrer was adjusted so that it was turning only enough to keep the phases mixed. The pH of the mixture was 4.50.Into the beaker containing the mixture of gum arabic and gelatin was poured 118.0 grams of synthetic clove oil as prepared in Part C. The speed of the stirrer was then adjusted to mix the colloids and the oil. The oil separated into droplets. Two drops of octyl alcohol were added to prevent foaming. The progress of the coacervation was monitored by means of microscopic examination.The temperature of the mixture was lowered to room temperature, e.g., 240C. At the higher temperature of 310C, colloid deposition was observed on theoildroplets. At 24 C, little colloid could be observed in aqueous portions of the mixture. Deposition had ceased. Stirring was continued for 30 minutes, whereupon the reaction mixture was cooled on an ice bath to 40C. The reaction mixture was maintained at this temperature for 200 minutes. When hardening was desired, 1.0 milliliters of a 25 glutaraldehyde in water per gram of gelatin is added. The internal phase of the capsules thus formed was approximately 80 908 of the total weight of the capsules.The capsules thus produced had diameters in the range of from 50 up to 500 microns. They were coated with the binder onto a tobacco sheet material which was shredded and used as a fill in the manufacture of a smoking article.Part E Variation of the encapsulation of synthetic clove oilA variation of the encapsulation procedure set forth immediately supra is shown below.The solution of gum arabic was warmed to 380C, placed in a Waring blender and stirred. The clove oil prepared inPart C was added gradually while the speed of the blender was being increased until the size of the clove oil droplets was approximately 50 500 microns. The mixture thus formed was poured into a 1,000 milliliter beaker containing gelatin, also at 380C, and was stirred thoroughly.The temperature was then allowed to drop to room temperature and then further decreased to a temperature of 40C to 100C by means of an ice bath.It is evident that the tobacco film or filaments can be made from various types and combinations of tobacco. For instance, the tobacco sheet material can be made from relatively expensive tobacco such as Latakia in which it is highly desirous to use all waste because of the high price thereof. So, also, it may be formed of Burley or one or more scrap or waste cigarette type tobaccos and incorporated in accordance with a particular cigarette manufacture s formula as if it were natural cigarette tobacco leaves. Any desired formula can thus be maintained in accordance with the demands of a manufacturer s particular brand using one or more types of natural shredded tobacco leaves and admixed desired quantities of shredded capsule containing tobacco film material or filaments, either as a blending or flavoring medium or both or for purposes of bulking.In the case of the manufacture of cigarettes, according tothepresent invention, tobacco films are shredded into strands or the film is formed directly into filaments swbstantially the width of the strands of natural shredded tobacco and of any desired length. In the case of cigars, the capsule containing films are used in large pieces much as long filler tobacco and forming long filler cigars.In all cases the shredded film or filaments or film used in cigarettes and cigars can be handled either manually or by machine in the same manner as natural shredded tobacco leaves or whole leaves or portions thereof. The amount of shredded capsule containing reconstituted tobacco or pieces of this material employed in a particular blend in cigarettes or cigars, respectively, will vary according to types of tobacco used in the sheet material and the requirements of a particular manufacture.Example XXXPreparation of a detergent compositionA total of 100 grams of detergent powder a low phosphate content detergent composition which contains 12 by weight phosphate builder, 8 hardness mineral ion insensi tive detergent, 0.9 by weight maleic anhydride vinyl compound co polymer and 2 alkylene oxide condensation product prepared according to Exam le IV at column XI, ofU.S. Patent No. 4,000,080 issued on December 28, 1976 is intimately admixed with 0.15 grams of one of the perfume materials of Table XII below until a substantially homogeneous composition is obtained.
