# Diffuser throttle ring control.

## Abstract
A centrifugal vapor compressor having a two position, pressure controlled diffuser throttle ring 30 is disclosed. The throttle ring is positively maintained in a minimum or a maximum throttling position by supplying either a relatively low pressure or a relatively high pressure, respectively, to a cavity 29 behind the throttle ring 30 . The throttle ring may be one of any of a variety of types of throttle rings including a new, improved throttle ring having a back portion with a sealing means which facilitates sliding movements of the throttle ring and which prevents vapor flow between the cavity behind the throttle ring and the diffuser passageway 16 .
