# Method of terminating optical fibres.

## Abstract
A method of terminating a glass optical fibre 13 by clamping the optical fibre 26 in a passageway in a ferrule 11 with an end portion 26 of the optical fibre core received in a bore in the ferrule end 17 and projecting beyond the ferrule end 17 severing the end portion 26 to provide an optical face at a predetermined distance from the ferrule end 17 and, radially crimping the ferrule 13 to advance the ferrule 11 relative to the optical fibre core 13 to locate the ferrule end 17 flush with the optical face.
