## Description
New substituted 3 parasubstituted phenoxy 1 alksylamino propanol 2 s, as well as process for their preparation, pharmaceutical preparations containing same, and method for treating cardiac failureDESCRIPTIONTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to new compounds with S adrenoceptor stimulating properties, process for their preparation, pharmaceutical preparations containing said compounds and methods for treatment of cardiac failure.The object of the invention is to obtain new drugs with a positive inotropic action on the heart which can be used for treatment of cardiac failure.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONMany heart diseases create such extensive damage to the muscle of the myocardium that a heart insufficiency occurs.A fundamental component in the therapy of heart insufficiency is an agent which has a positive inotropic action on the heart, i.e. one which increases the contractile force of the heart and or which has a positive chronotropic action on the heart i.e. one which increases the beating frequency.Presently the most commonly used agents are the glycosides of digitalis which have inotropic action. However, the digitalis preparations show evident drawbacks from a therapeutic point of view. They have a low therapeutic index and cause cardiac arrhythmias at dosages insignificantly higher than those needed for a positive inotropic effect. Thus, there is an evident therapeutic need of inotropic agents which can replace or complement the digitalis preparations. Normally the pumping activity of the heart is stimulated via the sympathetic nervous system by release of noradrenaline from the cardiac sympathetic nerves and by adrenaline from the adrenal medulla. The action on the heart is mediated via ssl adrenoceptors. However, both noradrenaline and adrenaline as well as the synthetic 6 adreno ceptor agonist isoprenaline have other effects on the circulatory system. Noradrenaline and adrenaline are strong constrictors of blood vessels while isoprenaline is a strong dilator. Furthermore, the three compounds are rapidly eliminated by metabolism and therefore very shortacting.The compounds of the present invention have stimulating effects on the heart related to those of the endogenous catecholamines and isoprenaline but are devoid of their vascular effects. Furthermore, the present compounds are longacting.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONIt has been found that the compounds of the general formulaEMI2.1 wherein R3 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen or methyl, m is an integer 0 or 1, whereby when m is 0, R4 and R5 are the same and selected from the group consisting of methoxy, fluoro, bromo, and chloro in 2 and 6 position, whereby when m is 1, R4 is hydrogen and R5 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methoxy, ethoxy, acetyl, methyl, hydroxymethyl, cyano, chloro, fluoro, bromo, hydroxy, and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof have valuable pharmacological properties and may fulfil the above mentioned objects.The substances are intended to be administered orally or parenterally for acute and chronic treatment of cardiac failure, specifically ventricular myocardial failure disease conditions with a diminution in ventricular contractility below that of a normal heart such that the capacity of the myocardium, at any given fiber length, to develop tension or to shorten against a load is so impaired as to compromise the circulation . Accordingly, the substances are intended to improve symptoms and signs of cardiac failure such as dyspnea, cyanosis, pulmonary edema, increased venous pressure, liver enlargement, and peripheral edema.The substances may be used alone and in combination with other therapeutic measures, such as administration of digitalis and diuretic drugs. Also, the substances may bE used in combination with other measures in treating cardiogenic shock, the condition associated with reduced arterial blood pressure which often complicates myocardial infarction.Another use for the substances is in treatment of bradycardia, that is, conditions with slow heart rhythm where the weak positive chronotropic effect in combination with the positive inotropic effect of the substances can be expected to be of therapeutic value.Compounds of the present invention of special interest are 1 l 2 2,6 dimethoxyphenyl l methylethylamino 3 4 hydroxyphenoxy propanol 2 2 3 4 hydroxyphenoxy l 2 4 hydroxyphenoxy l methyl ethylaminoZpropanol 2 3 l 2 216 dichlorophenyl l methylethylamino 3 4 hydroxyphenoxy propanol 2 4 3 4 hydroxyphenoxy 1 2 13 hdroxypheoxy l methyl ethylaminozpropanol 2 . 5 3 . 4 hydroxyphenoxy 1 2 3 methoxyphenoxy 1 methyl ethylamino propanol 2 6 l 2 3 chlorophenoxy l methyiethylaminoj 3 4 hydroxy phenoxy propanol 2 7 l 2 3 hydroxyphenoxy ethylamino 3 4 hydroxyphenoxy propanol 2 8 l 2 phenoxy l methylethylamino 3 4 hydroxyphenoxy propanol 2 9 1 2 phenoxyethylamino 3 4 hydroxyphenoxy propanol 2 10 l 2 2 hydroxyphenoxy ethylaminoj 3 4 hydroxyphenoxy propanol 2 11 1 2 2 chlorophenoxy ethylamino 3 4 hydroxyphenoxy propanol 2 12 3 4 hydroxyphenoxy l 2 2 methoxyphenoxy ethylamino propanol 2.According to one preferred embodiment the invention is related to compounds of formula I, wherein m is 0 and R4 and R5 are the same and selected from methoxy, fluoro, bromo and chloro in the 2 and 6 position.According to another preferred embodiment the invention is related to compounds of formula I, wherein m is 1, R4 is H and R5 is selected from hydrogen, methoxy, chloro, fluoro, bromo and hydroxy. Of those compounds are especially preferred compounds having the formulaEMI4.1 wherein R3 is hydrogen or methyl and R5 is selected from hydrogen, fluoro, chloro, bromo and hydroxy.Preferred specific compounds are those numbered 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 above.Salt forming acids may be used in preparing therapeutically acceptable salts of the compounds. Such acids are hydrohalogen acids, sulphuric acids, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic or heterocyclic carboxy or sulphuric acids, such as formic, acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, or pyruvic acid, phenylacetic, benzoic, p aminobenzoic, anthranilic, p hydroxybenzoic, salicyclic or p aminosalicyclic acid, pamoic acid, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, hydroxy ethanesulfoni c, ethylenesulfonic, halogenbenzenesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, naphtylsulfonic or sulfanilic acid, methionine, tryptophane, lysine or arginine. The new compounds are obtained according to methods known per se. Thus, a a compound of the formula II EMI5.1 wherein Z is OH or an esterified, reactive hydroxy group, or OH and Z together form an epoxy group, is reacted with an amine of the formula III EMI6.1 wherein R3, R4, R5, and m have the meanings given above.A reactive, esterified hydroxy group is particularly a hydroxy group esterified with a strong, inorganic or organic acid, preferably a hydrohalogen acid, as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, or hydroiodic acid, further sulfuric acid or a strong organic sulfonic acid, e.g. benzenesulfonic acid, 4 bromobenzenesulfonic acid, or 4 toluenesulfonic acid. Thus, Z is preferably chloro, bromo or iodo.This reaction is carried out in a common way. At the use of a reactive ester as a starting material the preparation takes place preferably in the presence of a basic condensating agent and or with an excess of an amine.Suitable basic condensating agents are e.g. alkalimetal hydroxides as sodium or potassium hydroxide, alkalimetal carbonates as potassium carbonate and alkalimetal alcoholates as sodium methylate, potassium ethylate and potassium tert.butylate.The reaction is preferably carried out in an alkanol having 1 to 4 carbon atoms by refluxing the reactants in said solvent for a time long enough to give the compound of formula I, generally 1 to 12 hours. However, the reaction can be carried out in the presence of an excess of amine alone. The reaction can also take place in an autoclave.When Z is a hydroxy group the reaction is performed in the presence of a metal catalyst, preferably Raney nickel.Further, b a compound of formula IV EMI7.1 is reacted with a compound of the formula VEMI7.2 or with a compound of formula VIEMI7.3 or with a compound of formula VIIEMI7.4 wherein Z, R3, R4, R5, and m have the meanings given above.This reaction is carried out in a common way, preferably in the presence of a basic condensating agent and or an excess of an amine, by using a metal catalyst e.g. Raney nickel as a condensating agent Z HO or by aminomercuration reaction between amine and olefin .Suitable basic condensating agents are e.g. alkaline alcoholates, preferably sodium or potassium alcoholate, or also alkaline carbonates as sodium or potassium carbonate. Further, c a compound of formula VIIIEMI8.1 is reacted with a compound of the formula IXEMI8.2 wherein Z, R3, R4, R5, and m have the meanings given above.Further, e a compound of the formula XEMI8.3 wherein R4 and R have the meanings given above, is reacted with a compound of the formula XIEMI8.4 wherein R and Z have the meanings given above.These two latter reactions are carried out in a common way.In those cases where reactive esters are used as starting material, the compound of formula VIII may suitably be used in the form of its metalphenolate as alkalimetalphenolate, preferably sodiumphenolate, or one works in the presence of an acid binding agent, preferably a condensating agent, which can form a salt of the compound of formula VIII as an alkalimetal alcoholate.This reaction is preferably carried out in an alkanol having 1 to 3 carbon atoms in an autoclave being heated to 80 to 100C for 1 to 15 hours.Further, d a compound of formula VIIIEMI9.1 is reacted with a compound of formula XIIEMI9.2 wherein R3, R4, R5, and shave the meanings given above.This reaction is carried out in a common way. Thus, the reaction is carried out under alkaline conditions in a suitable solvent, as benzylalcohol by boiling the reaction mixture for some hours. Thereby the phenol is primarily converted to its metalphenolate as alkalimetalphenolate before it is added to the acetidinol of formula XII.Further, f one may split off a residue from a compound of formula I above, in which the nitrogen atom of the amino group and or the hydroxy groups have attached thereto a splitable residue. Such splitable residues are especially those which are splitable by solv olysis, reduction, pyrolysis or fermentation.Residues splitable by means of hydrolysis are e.g. an acyl residue, which, when present, also can be functionally varied carboxy groups, e.g. oxycarbonyl residues, as alkoxycarbonyl residues, e.g. tert. butoxycarbonyl residue, or ethoxycarbonyl residue, aralkoxycarbonyl residues as phenylloweralkoxycarbonyl residues, e.g. a carbobenzyloxy residue, halogencarbonyl residue, e.g. a chlorocarbonyl residue, and carbamoyl groups. Further, arylsulphonyl residues as toluenesulphonyl or bromobenzenesulphonyl residues and possibly as halogenated, as fluorinated lower alkanoyl residues as formyl, acetyl or trifluoroacetyl residues or a benzyl residue or cyano groups or silyl residues, as trimethylsilyl residue.Of the above mentioned residues present at the hydroxy groups, which residues are splitable by hydrolysis, preferably the oxycarbonyl residues and the loweralkanoyl residues or the benzoyl residues are used.Besides the above mentioned also double bound residues, which are splitable at the amino group by hydrolysis are used, e.g. alkylidene or benzylidene residue or a phosphorylidene group as a triphenylphosphorylidene group, whereby the nitrogen atom then obtains a positive charge.Residues splitable at the amino group by hydrolysis are furthermore diva lent residues as in occurring cases substituted methylene. As substituents on the methylene residues any organic residue may be used, whereby it does not matter at the hydrolysis which compound is the substituent to the methylene residue. As methylene substituents e.g. aliphatic or aromatic residues as alkyl as mentioned above, aryl e.g. phenyl or pyridyl may b used. The hydrolysis may be carried out in any common way, suitably in a basic or preferably in an acid medium.Compounds having residues being splitable by hydrolysis are also the compounds according to formula XIIIEMI11.1 wherein R3, R4, R5, and m have the same meanings as given above and Y is a carbonyl, thiocarbonyl, or aEMI11.2 residue, wherein A and B are each severally hydrogen, alkyl, alkylaryl or aryl.The hydrolysis is carried out in an analogous way, erg. in the presence of a hydrolysing agent, e.g. in the presence of an acidic agent as e.g. diluted mineral acids, as sulfuric acid or hydrohalogen acid, or in the presence of basic agents as e.g. alkalimetal hydroxides, as sodium hydroxide. Oxycarbonyl residues, aryl sulfonyl residues and cyano groups may in a suitable way be split off by means of acidic agents as by means of a hydrohalogen acid, suitably hydrobromic acid. Preferably the splitting may take place using diluted hydrobromic acid, possibly in a mixture with acetic acid. Cyano groups are preferably split off by means of hydrobromic acid at an elevated temperature, as in boiling hydrobromic acid, according to the bromo cyano method v. Braun . Further, e.g. a tert. butoxycarbonyl residue may be split off under anhydrous conditions by means of a treatment with a suitable acid, as trifluoracetic acid. Acidic agents are preferably used at a hydrolysis of compounds of formula XIII.Residues splitable by ammonolysis are especially the halogencarbonyl residues, as the chlorocarbonyl residue.The ammonolysis may be carried out in a common way, e.g. by means of an amine containing at least one hydrogen atom bound to the nitrogen atom, as a mono or diloweralkylamine e.g. methylamine or dimethylamine, or especially ammonia, preferably at an elevated temperature. Instead of ammonia one may use an agent which gives ammonia as hexamethylenetetraamine.Residues splitable by means of a reduction are e.g. an a arylalkyl residue, as a benzyl residue or an a aralkoxycarbonyl residue as a benzyloxycarbonyl residue, which in a common way may be split off by means of a hydrogenolysis, especially by catalytically activated hydrogen, as by hydrogen in the presence of hydrogenating catalysts, e.g.Raney nickel. Further residues splitable by means of hydrogenolysis are 2 halogenalkoxycarbonyl residues as 2,2,2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl residues or 2 iodoethoxy or 2,2,2 tribromoethoxycarbonyl residdes, which may be split off in a common way, suitably by means of a metallic reduction so called nascerating hydrogen . Nascerating hydrogen may be obtained by the influence of metal or metal alloys, as amalgam on compounds which give hydrogen as carboxylic acids, alcohols or water, whereby especially zink or zinkalloys together with acetic acid may be used. Hydrogenolysis of 2 halogenakoxycarbonyl residues may further take place using chromium or chromium II compounds as chromium II chloride or chromium II acetate.A residue splitable by reduction may also be an arylsulphonyl group as a toluenesulphonyl group, which in a common way may be split off by reduction using nascerating hydrogen, e.g. by means of an alkalimetal, as lithium or sodium in liquid ammonia, and suitably may be split off from a nitrogen atom. At the carrying out of the reduction one has to take care that other reducible groups are not influenced.Residues splitable by means of pyrolysis, especially residues splitable from the nitrogen atom, are in occurring cases substituted suitably unsubstituted carbamoyl groups.Suitable substituents are e.g. loweralkyl or arylloweralkyl as methyl or benzyl or aryl, as phenyl, the pyrolysis is carried out in a common way, whereby bne may have to take care of other thermically susceptible groups.Residues splitable by means of fermentation, especially residues splitable from the nitrogen atom are in occurring cases substituted, however, suitably unsubstituted carbamoyl groups. Suitable substituents are e.g. loweralkyl or arylloweralkyl, as methyl or benzyl, or aryl as phenyl. The fermentation is carried out in a common way, e.g. by means of the enzyme urease or soy bean extract at about 200C or slightly elevated temperature.Further, g a Schiff s base of formula XIV or XVEMI13.1 or a cyclic tautomer corresponding to formula XV of formula XVI EMI14.1 or a compound corresponding to formula I and having an unsaturation a to the amino nitrogen can be reduced1 wherein R3, R4, R5, and m have the same meanings as given above, and whereby the compounds of formula XV and XVI may exist together, too.This reduction is carried out in a common way, e.g. using a di lightmetalhydride, as sodium borohydride, lithium aluminium hydride, using a hydride as Boran with formic acid, or by means of a catalytic hydrDgenation, as with hydrogen in the presence of Raney nickel. At the reduction one has to take care that other groups are not affected.The reduction of the compound of formula XV above can also take pEace with CH3M, wherein M is a metal e.g. Mg, Li, for R being hydrogen in formula XV to produce a compound of formula I.A compound corresponding to formula I and having an unsaturation a to the amino nitrogen may be a compound of formulae XVII and XVIII which can be reduced ina common way e.g. by means of catalytic hydrogenation or with diboranEMI14.2 Further, h the oxo group in the compound of formula XIXEMI15.1 wherein R3, R4, R5, and m have the same meanings as given above, can be reduced to a hydroxy group.This reduction is carried out in a common way, especially using a di lightmetalhydride, as mentioned above, or according to the Meerwein Pondorf Verley method or a modification thereof, suitably using an alkanol as a reaction component and as solvent, as isopropanol, and using a metalalkanolate, as metalisopropanolate, e.g. aluminium isopropanolate.Further, i the oxo group in a compound corresponding to these of formula I and which carries an oxo group at a carbon atom bound to a nitrogen atom may be reduced by two hydrogen atoms.Said compounds are e.g. such of the formula XXEMI15.2 wherein R3, R4, R5, and m have the same meanings as given above, or of the formula XXIEMI15.3 wherein R4, R5, and m have the meanings given above. Further, an oxo group, or a derivative of a hydroxy groupOr halogen in a benzylic position can be reduced to methylene e.g. by means of catalytical hydrogenation Pd C or by Wolff Kischner reduction or the like. Thus, the compounds of the formulae XXII and XXI II can be reduced.EMI16.1 wherein R3, R4, and R5 have the meanings given above and X is OH or halogen.The reduction can be carried out according to the above described manner using complex metalhydrides, e.g.lithiumaluminiumhydride or di isobutylaluminiumhydride.Suitably the reaction takes place in an inert solvent as an ether, e.g. diethylether or tetrahydrofuran. Complex borohydrides can also be used especially when a selective reaction is wanted.Further, k a compound of the present invention can be obtained by eliminating one or more substituents in one or both of the aromatic rings. Such substituents are F, Br, C1, and I which can be eliminated by means of hydrogenolysis, or amino groups which are removable by diazotizing and hydrolysis. The splitting off of a substituent can also take place in connection with prior mentioned methods. In a compound of formula I a phenol hydroxy group in either or both the aromatic rings can be formed by cleavage of a corresponding ether, e.g. a benzyl, allyl, silyl, alkyl e.g. methyl ether, a tetrahydropyranyl or other ether obtainable by ether formation with a vinyl ether. The ether cleavage constitutes an ancillary step to the synthetic methods mentioned above in such cases when the starting materials contain such an ether group in the place of a phenol hydroxy group or such a group is introduced during the synthesis.Depending on the process conditions and the starting material the end product is obtained either in free form or in the form of its acid additions salt, which is included in the scope of the invention. Thus, for example, basic neutral or mixed salts may be obtained as well as hemiamino , sesqui or polyhydrates. The acid addition salts of the new compounds may in a manner known per se be transformed into free compounds using e.g. basic agents as alkali or ion exchanger. On the other ohand, the free bases obtained may form salts with organic or inorganic acids. In the preparation of acid addition salts preferably such acids are used which form suitable therapeutically acceptable salts. Such acids are e.g. hydrohalogen acids, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic or heterocyclic carboxy or sulphonic acids1 such as formic, acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, maleic, hydroxymaleic or pyruvic acid, phenylacetic, benzoic, p aminobenzoic, anthranilic, p hydroxybenzoic, salicyclic or p aminosalicyclic acid, pamoic acid, methanesulphonic, ethanesulphonic, hydroxyethanesulphonic, ethylenesulphonic acids, halogenbenzenesulphonic, toluenesulphonic, naphthylsulphonic acids, or sulphanilic acid methionine, tryptohpane, lysine or arginine. These or other salts of the new compounds as e.g. picrates may serve as purifying agents or the free bases obtained as the free bases are transformed into salts, these are separated and the bases are then set free from the salts again. According to the close relationship between the new compounds in free form and in the form of their salts it will be understood from the above and the below that, if possible, the corresponding salts are included in the free compound.The invention also relates to any embodiment of the process of which one starts from any compound obtained as an intermediate in any process step and one carries out the lacking process step, or one breaks off the process at any step, or at which one forms a starting material under the reaction conditions, or at which a reaction component possibly in the form of its salt is present.Thus, one may react an aldehyde of the formula XXIVEMI18.1 with an amine of the formula XXVEMI18.2 wherein R3, R4, R5, and m have the meanings given above, in the presence of a suitable reducing agent1 as one of the above mentioned. Thereby a compound of formula XIV is obtained as an intermediate, which then is reduced according to the invention. Further, one may in a manner known per se react an amine of the formula IV with a keton of the formula XXVIEMI19.1 wherein R3, R4, R5, and m have the meanings given above, in the presence of a suitable reducing agent1 as one of the above mentioned to produce compounds of formula XV or XVI as an intermediate, which then is reduced according to the invention.The new compounds may, depending on the choice of starting materials and process, be present as optical antipodes or racemate, or if they contain two asymmetric carbon atoms be present as an isomer mixture racemate mixture .The isomer mixtures racemate mixtures obtained may depending on physical chemical differences of the component, be separated into the both stereoisomeric diastereomericl pure racemate e.g. by means of chromatography and or fractionated crystallization.The racemates obtained can be separated according to known methods, e.g. by means of recrystallization from an optical active solvent, by means of microorganisms, or by a reaction with optically active acids forming salts of the compound and separating the salts thus obtained, e.g.by means of their different solubility in the diastereomers, from which the antipodes by the influence of a suitable agent may be set free. Suitable useable optically active acids are e.g. the Land D forms of tartaric acid, di o tolyltartaric acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, camphersulphonic acid or quinic acid. Preferably the more active part of the two antipodes is isolated. Further the two enantiomers can be obtained by asymmetrical reduction of the corresponding keto compound.Suitably such starting materials are used for carrying out the reactions of the invention, which material leads to groups of end products primarily especially desired and especially to the specifically described and preferred end products.The starting materials are known or may, if they should be new, be obtained according to processes known per se.In clinical use the compounds of the invention are administered normally orally, rectally or by injection in the form of a pharmaceutical preparation, which contains an active component either as free base or as pharmaceutically acceptable, non toxic acid addition salts, e.g. the hydrochloride lactate, acetate, sulphamate or the like in combination with a pharmaceutical carrier.Thereby the mentioning of the new compounds of the invention is here related to either the free amine base or the acid addition salts of the free base, even if the compounds are generally or specifically described, provided that the context in which such expressions are used, e.g. in the examples, with this broad meaning should not correspond.The carrier may be a solid, semisolid or liquid diluent or a capsule.

The binding agent is homogenized and suspended in a certain amount of solvent. The therapeutic compound and necessary auxiliary agents are mixed during as continuous and constantly mixing with the binding agent solution and are moistened so that the solution is uniformly divided in the mass without overmoistening any parts. The amount of solvent is usually so adapted that the mass obtains a consistency reminding of wet snow. The moistening of the pulverulent mixture with the binding agent solution causes the particles to gather together slightly to aggregates and the real granulating process is carried out in such a way that the mass is pressed through a sieve in the form of a net of stainless steel having a mesh size of about 1 mm. The mass is then placed in thin layers on a tray to be dried in a drying cabinet. This drying takes place during 10 hours and has to be standardized carefully as the damp degree of the granulate is.of utmost importance for the following process and for the feature of the tablets. Drying in a fluid bed may possibly bb used. In this case the mass is not put on a tray but is poured into a container having a net bottom.After the drying step the granules are sieved so that the particle size wanted is obtained. Under certain circumstances powder has to be removed.To the so called final mixture, disintegrating, antifriction agents and antiadhesive agents are added. After this mixture the mass shall have its right composition for the tabletting step.The cleaned tablet punching machine is provided with a certain set of punches and dies, whereupon the suitable adjustment for the weight of the tablets and the degree of compression is tested out. The weight of the tablet is decisive for the size of the dose in each tablet and is calculated starting from the amount of therapeutic agent in the granules. The degree of compression affects the size of the tablet. its strength and its ability to disintegrate in water. Especially as regards the two latter properties the choice of compression pressure 0.5 to 5 ton means something of a balance step. When the right adjustment is set, the preparation of tablets is started which is carried out with a rate of 20,000 to 200,000 tablets per hour. The pressing of the tablets requires different times and depends on the size of the batch.The tablets are freed from adhering pulver in a specific apparatus and are then stored in closed packages until they are delivered. Many tablets, especially these which are rough or bitter, are coated with a coating. This means that these are coated with a layer of sugar or some other suitable coating.The tablets are usually packed by machines having an electronic counting device. The different types of packages consist of glass or plastic gallipots but also boxes, tubes and specific dosage adapted packages.The daily dose of the active substance varies and is depending on the type of administration, but as a general rule it is 100 to 400 mg day of active substance at peroral administration and 5 to 20 mg day at intravenous administration.BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTIONThe following illustrates the principle and the adaption of the invention, however, without being limited thereto.Temperature is given in degrees Celsius.Example 1 19.4 g of 2 2,6 dimethoxyphenyl l methylethylamine were dissolved in 100 ml of isopropanol and 12.8 g of 3 4 benzyloxyphenoxy l,2 epoxypropane in 300 ml of isopropanol were added in 2 h during reflux.

The animals were pretreated with reserpine 5 mg kg i.p. about 16 hours before experiment. This treatment eliminated the reflex sympathetic control of the heart and the vascular tonus. Following pentobarbital anaesthesia Mebumal , 30 mg kg i.p. artificial air respiration was started. The two vagus nerves were cut and the adrenal glands were excluded from the circulation by means of ligatures on the adrenal veins.Blood pH, PC02 and p02 were kept within the normal ranges throughout the experiments. All recordings were made on aGrass Polygraph. Heart rate, pressure in the left ventricle LVP , the first derivative of LVP dP dt , intra arterial blood pressure and peripheral resistance were recorded,LVP was recorded via a catheter tip pressure transducer Millar , which was inserted via the left carotid artery.This.pressure curve was differentiated and max dP dt was recorded by means of a peak detector. The recording of max dP dt was linear up to 20 000 mg Hg s. The increase in max dP dt was used as a measure of the increased contractility of the heart.To study the effect on peripheral vascular resistance the blood passing through a femoral artery was fed via a catheter and a pump back to the distal part of the vessel.With pressure transducer the perfusion pressure was registered. At a perfusion with a constant flow the perfusion pressure is directly proportional to the peripheral resistance of the vascular bed of the hind limb.The substances were administered intravenously in increasing doses. Dose response curves were constructed for max dP dt and the vasodilatation by plotting the per cent of the maximal response against the logarithm of the dose of the drug.The compounds according to the invention caused a dose dependent increase in contractility with half maximal effects at doses 0.01 0.36 umol kg. Isoprenaline has a very short duration of action which requires continuous infusion. Half maximal effect of isoprenaline was obtained at 0.004 umol kg.min. The maximal effects on cardiac contractility amounted to 70 96 per cent of maximal response to isoprenaline. The compounds had no effects on peripheral blood vessels, indicating that the compounds are Bl selective agonists. The duration of action of the compounds has been studied in conscious beagle dogs. An electromagnetic flow probe was inplanted on the ascending aorta for determination of the inotropic effect measured as maximal flow acceleration max d.F dt in the aorta. For determination of blood pressure catheters were implanted in thoracic aorta and left atrium. Increasing doses of the substances were administered intravenously and the decline of inotropic effect max dF dt was used for determination of duration.The time for 50 decline of the positive inotropic effect max dF dt varied from 60 up to 180 min for the compounds according to the invention, comparative value for isoprenaline was less than 1 min. Thus all the compounds showed a long duration of action as compared to isoprenaline,
