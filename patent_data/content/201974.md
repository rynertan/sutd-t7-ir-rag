# Method for preparing a milk shake product.

## Abstract
A milk shake is prepared by freezing at least two portions of its constituents under different conditions, such that clearly different ice crystal sizes are generated, and freezing the combined portions to a storing temperature for consumption by partly thawing it, using a controlled amount of microwave energy.

## Claims
1. A method for making a milk shake product comprising the steps of preparing a frozen aerated mix containing water, fat, sugar, stabilizer, emulsifier and flavours, freezing the mix to a temperature under 15 C, wherein such conditions are used that clearly different ice crystal sizes are generated in the mix in such relative amounts that, on thawing this frozen aerated mix using a controlled amount of microwave energy, such amount of ice crystals can be molten that the mix becomes generally fluid and the remainder of the ice crystals remain in a non agglomerated condition dispersed in the fluid and that this amount of microwave energy is supplied to the frozen mix for partly thawing it.

## Description
A milk shake is usually made by thoroughly mixing milk, ice cream and a flavouring material, such as fruit flavoured syrup or fruit, to provide a cold, creamy fluid product having some overrun. Milk shakes have to be prepared right before their consumption. In the food serving businesses, such as restaurants, cafetarias and canteens, it is relatively time consuming to prepare milk shakes, and attempts have been made to prepare them in advance in anticipation of peak business. However, conventionally prepared milk shakes are not suitable for freezing and subsequent thawing, and attempts with different formulations which were more suitable for frozen storage led to off taste and different textures and did not provide products comparable with the usual milk shakes. According to the invention, there is provided a method for making a milk shake product comprising the steps of preparing a frozen aerated mix containing water, fat, sugar, stabilizer, emulsifier and flavour, and cooling the mix to a temperature below 15 C, wherein such conditions are used that clearly different ice crystal sizes are generated in the mix in such relative amounts that, on thawing this frozen aerated mix using a controlled amount of microwave energy, such amount of ice crystals can be molten that the mix becomes generally fuild and the remainder of the crystals remain in a non agglomerated condition dispersed in the fluid and that this amount of microwave energy is applied to the frozen mix for partly thawing it. The particle size distribution of the ice crystals in the frozen mix can be very broad, i.e. considerably broader than in conventional aerated ice cream products, but can also be such that at least two clearly discernible ranges of particle sizes are present. A preferred and practical way of obtaining different ice crystal sizes is freezing at least two separate portions of an unfrozen mix under different conditions, such that different ice crystal sizes are generated, and thereafter combining these portions. The conditions used for controlling the ice crystal sizes are preferably the mixing conditions, because of the ease of controlling them. However, different ice crystal sizes may be obtained by first preparing two different emulsions, at least one of which being aerated, or by freezing the portions using different freezing rates. In a preferred embodiment, a portion of the mix containing a relatively large amount of water and a relatively small amount of freezing point depressants is frozen hard, broken into relatively coarse particles and mixed with the remainder of the mix containing a correspondingly small amount of water and a correspondingly large amount of freezing point depressants and which is frozen under mixing conditions such that relatively fine ice crystals are formed. Very suitably, a portion of the mix is frozen in a scraped wall heat exchanger, another portion of the mix is frozen in another scraped wall heat exchanger running at a different speed and the two portions are combined and mixed. In this embodiment standard ice cream equipment can be used. Another suitable way of obtaining the crystal size distribution aimed at is freezing a portion of the liquid mix under mixing conditions, adding another portion of the liquid mix and continuing freezing the combined portions under mixing conditions. In a practical embodiment thereof, a portion of the liquid mix is frozen in a scraped wall heat exchanger, another portion of the liquid mix is added thereto and the combined mix is frozen in a second scraped wall heat exchanger. This method again is advantageous in that standard ice cream equipment can be used. In this specification and claims the expression portion of the mix comprises both portions of the same and of different composition. The invention will be illustrated in the following non limiting Examples, in which all percentages are by weight except for the overrun being by volume. A liquid base mixture consisting of Fresh whole milk 8.7 milk solids non fat, 3.6 fat is frozen and milled to particle sizes ranging from about 100 microns to about 1000 microns, which are relatively coarse as compared with the ice crystal sizes in the frozen base mix. 57 frozen base mix is mixed with 43 milled frozen milk and the combined mix is frozen to usual temperatures for storing and distributing ice cream. 300 ml of the hard frozen product is put in a 1000 W microwave oven and heated for about 50 seconds, such that the fine ice crystals are melted but the coarse crystals are still present in the final product. The actual heating time is dependent on the oven design and can be easily determined. A liquid mixture, consisting of These streams are combined, mixed and frozen to usual temperatures for storing and distributing ice cream. This hard frozen product can be prepared for consumption as described in Example I. A liquid base mixture as defined in Example I is frozen in a usual manner in an ice cream votator. Thereafter, milk is added in a ratio of 60 base mixture to 40 milk and the combined mixture is further frozen in a second votator and finally cooled to usual storage temperatures for ice confection products. This hard frozen product can be prepared for consumption as described in Example I.
