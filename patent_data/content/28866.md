THE ENZYMES The enzyme component herein is incorporated in an amount of from about 0.025 to about 1 , preferably from about 0.05 to about 0.2. The preferred proteolytic enzyme component should give to the composition a proteolytic activity of at least about 4 Anson units per liter, preferably from about 15 to about 70 Anson units per liter, most preferably from about 20 to about 40 Anson units per liter. A proteolytic activity of from about 3 to about 5Anson units per gram of product is desirable.Other enzymes, including amylolytic enzymes can also be included Preferably the enzyme component is characterized by an isoelectric point of from about 8.5 to about 10, preferably from about 9 to about 9.5 Examples of suitable proteolytic enzymes include many species which are known to be adapted for use in detergent compositions and, in fact, have been used in detergent compositions. Sources of the enzymes include commercial enzyme preparations such as Alcalase sold by Novo Industries, and axatase sold by Gist Brocades, Delft, TheNetherlands, which contain from about 10 to about 20 enzyme. Other preferred enzyme compositions include those commercially available under the tradenames SP 72 Esperase manufactured and sold by Novo Industries, A S, Copenhagen, Denmark and AZ Protease manufactured and sold byGist Brocades, Delft, The Netherlands. A more complete disclosure of suitable enzymes can be found in U.S. Patent 4,101,457, Place et al issued July 18, 1978, incorporated herein by reference.The Alcohol The low molecular weight primary or secondary alcohol is exemplified by methanol, ethanol, propanol, and isopropanol. Monphydric alcohols are preferred for solubilizing the surfactant but polyols containing from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms and from 2 to about 6 hydroxy groups can be used and can provide improved enzyme stability. Examples of polyols include propylene glycol, ethylene glycol and glycerine. Ethanol is a particular preferred alcohol. The composition contains from 0 to about 20 , preferably from about 5 to about 15 , most preferably from about 9 to about 11.4 of the alcohol.The Carboxylic Acid Salt The short chain carboxylic acid salt is preferably water soluble and more preferably is a formate, e.g., sodium formate. The formates are surprisingly much more effective than other short chain carboxylic salts like the acetates and the propionates. The short chain carboxylic acid salt is used at a level from about 0.1 to about 10 , preferably from about 0.3 to about 3 , more preferably from about 0.5 to about 1.5 when the product pH is below about 8.5 and from about 3 to about 10 , preferably from about 4 to about 8 , when the product pH is from about 8.5 to about 10.At the higher pH s 8.5 10 only formates are suitable.The Calcium Ions Any water soluble calcium salt can be used as a source of calcium ions, including calcium acetate, calcium formate and calcium propionate. The level of calcium ions in the composition is from about 0.1 to about 10 millimoles of calcium ion per liter, preferably from about 0.5 to about 1.5 millimoles of calcium ion per liter when the product pH is below about 8.5 and from about 4 to about 8 millimoles when the product pH is from about 8.5 to about 10.

A pH of from about 8.5 to about 10 preferably 9 to 10 is best for detergency. Both high and low pH s adversely affect enzyme stability and low pH s give up too much detergent effectiveness. Suitable pH buffers include mono , di and tri ethanolamines. When the product pH is from 8.5 to about 10 triethanolamine is the best buffer. When soap or fatty acid is present, the preferred pli is from about 7 to about 7.5. The balance of the composition is usually water, but the composition can contain other ingredients, including perfumes, dyes, opacifiers, optical brighteners, suds suppressors, pH adjusting agents, etc. Disclosures of suitable ingredients can be found in the patents and patent applications incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, the product is essentially free of materials such as detergent builders that tie up calcium ions to permit sufficient free calcium ions to be present although with the formate, excellent stability is achieved with very low levels of calcium ions, especially in the low pH range.Preferred Compositions Containing Soap lov pE ranre only . In a preferred embodiment homogeneous aqueous detergent compositions of this invention comprise a from about 20 to about 50 by weight of an organic synthetic surface active agent b from about 3 to about 15 by weight of a saturated fatty acid having 10 to 16 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain c from 0.0252 to about 11 by weight of an enzyme d from 0.1t to about 3 by weight of a carboxylic acid having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms and e less than 2 millimoles of enzyme accessible calcium per kilo of the detergent compo sition, the pH of the composition measured as is at 200C, being from about 6.5 to 8.5.In these preferred embodiments of this invention, the saturated fatty acids preferably have from 12 to 14 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, the detergent enzymes are represented by proteases or mixtures of proteases and amylases, the short chain carboxylic acid is represented by formic acid, the enzyme accessible calcium is present in an amount of from about 0.5 to 1.5 millimoles per kilo of the detergent composition, and the pH of the composition, as is, is in the range from about 7 to about 7.5.These preferred compositions of this invention are substantially builder free. While the fatty acids and or soaps are not c,onsidared as detergent builders sequestrants in the context of this invention, the claimed compositions do not contain more than minor amounts of sequestrants. The Saturated Fatty Acid. In this preferred embodiment, the saturated fatty acid component is incorporated in an amount of from about 3 to about 15 , preferably from about 5 to about 11 . The saturated fatty acids have from 10 to 16, preferably 12 or 14 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain. The most preferred fatty acids are either lauric acid or lauric and myristic fatty acid in a mixture of 5 1 to 1 1. It is understood that in addition to the saturated fatty acids, the compositions herein can comprise certain amounts of unsaturated fatty acids having, for example, 16 or 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain. Known examples of the like unsaturated fatty acids are oleic fatty acid and palmitoleic fatty acid. The Enzyme. In this preferred embodiment the enzyme component is incorporated in an amount of from about 0.025 to about 1 , preferably from about 0.54O to about 0.28. The preferred proteolytic enzyme component should give to the composition a proteolytic activity of at least about 4 Anson units, preferably from about 8 to about 30 Anson units most preferably from about 10 to about 20 Anson units per kilo of the liquid detergent composition. In another prefer, red embodiment the enzyme component canbe represented by a mixture of proteases and amylases. The proteolytic activity of that mixture is as defined hereinbefore. Preferably the enzyme component is characterized by an isoelectric point of from about 8.0 to about 10, preferably from about 8.5 to about 9.5.The. Carboxylic Acid. In this preferred embodiment this ingredient is used in an amount from 0.1 to about. 3 , preferably from 0.5t to 1. 5 by weight. Preferred are the water soluble salts. ost preferred is formic acid or the formates such as sodium, potassium, lithium, amines and substituted amines, inclusive of mono , di , and tri ethanolamines. The Enzyme Accessible Calcium. These preferred compositions herein comprise less than about 2, preferably from 0.5 to 1.5, millimoles of enzymeaccessible calcium per kilo of the homogenous enzyme contain ing detergent product. The claimed compoaitions are sub stantially free of sequestrants, for example, polyacids capable of forming calcium complexes which are soluble in the composition. However, minor amounts of sequestrants such as polyacids or mixtures of polyacids can be used. The enzyme accessible calcium is defined as the amount of calciumions effectively available to the enzyme component. The calcium sequestration resulting from e.g., 0.5 of a mixture of polyphosphonates and polyacids as exemplified hereinafter can represent about 1 to about 1.5 millimoles of calcium per kilo of product.The total calcium incorporated into the compositions is thus comprised of the enzyme accessible calcium and also the calcium sequestered by the low levels of polyacids. From a practical standpoint the enzyme accessible calcium is therefore the soluble calcium in the cor1position in the absence of any strong sequestrants, e.g., having an equilibrium constant of complexation with calcium equal to or greater than 1.5 at 20 C.Product pH. The pH of these preferred products is from about 6.5 to about 8.5, preferably from about 7 to about 7.5 to obtain a combination of enzyme stability and detergency.Both high and low pH s can adversely affect enzyme staabilityOptional Components In addition to the essential ingredients described hereinbefore the preferred compositions herein frequently contain a series of optional ingredients which are used for the known functionality in conventional levels. While the invention compositions are premised on aqueous enzyme containing detergent compositions containing a critical ternary system as fully explained above, it is frequently desirable to use a phase regulant. This component together with water constitutes then the solvent matrix for the claimed liquid compositions.Suitable phase regul ants are well known in liquid detergent technology and, for example, can be represented by lower aliphatic alcohols having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms and. from 1 to 3 hydroxy groups, ethers of ethylene Glycol and lower aliphatic monoalcohols having from 1 to 4 carbon atom Specific examples of phase regulants are ethanol n propanol isopropanl butanol 1,2 propanediol 1,3 propanediol nhexanol monomethyl , ethyl , propyl, and mono butyl ethers and ethylene glycol.Additional phase regulants having a relatively high boiling point and low vapor pressure e can also be used proyided they.do not react with the other ingredients of the compositions. Known detergent hydrotropes are a further class of phase regulants suitable for use herein. Examples of these hydrotropes include salts of alkylarylsulfonates having up to 3 carbon atoms in the alkylgroup, e.g., sodium, potassium, ammonium and ethanolamine salts of xylene , toluene , ethyl benzene , cumene , and isopropylbenzene sulfonic acids. The phase regulant is frequently used in an amount from about 5 to, aBout 20 the sum of phase regulant and water is normally in the range from 65 to 35 . The preferred compositions herein can contain a series of further optional ingredients which are mostly used in additive levels, usually below about 5 . Examples of the like additives include polyacids, suds regulants, opacifiers, antioxidants, bactericides, dyes, perfumes, brighteners and the like. A preferred additive is represented by, a polyacid or mixture of polyacids in an amount below about 12. Suitable polyacids can include citric, cyclohexane 1,1 dicarboxylic, cyclopropane 1,1 dicarboxylic, dimethylmalic, glutaric, o hydroxybenzoic, m hydroxybenzoic, p hydroxybenzoic, itaconic, methylsuccinic, sodium tripolyphosphates, and nitrilotriacetic acic Preferred polyacid species for use herein can be represented by citric acid and organo phosphonic acids 2nd mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred alkylene polyamino polyalkylene phosphonic acids are ethylene diamine tetrame thylenephosphonic acid, hexamethylene diaminetetramethylene phosphonic acid, diethylene triaminepentamethylenephosphonic acid, and amino trimethylenephosphonic acid or the salts thereof. These organophosphonic acids salts are preferably used in an amount from 0.1 0.8 . The beneficial utilization of the claimed compositions under various usage conditions can require the utilization of a suds regulant. While generally all detergent suds regulants can de utilized preferred for use herein are alkylated polysiloxanes such as dimethylpolyailoxane also frequently termed silicones. The silicones are frequently used in a leyel not exceeding 0.5 , most preferably between 0.01 and 0.2 . It can also be desirable to utilize opacifiers inasmuch as they contribute to create a uniform appearance or the concentrated liquid detergent compositions. Examples of suitable opacifiers include polystyrene commercially Icnown as LYTRON. 621 manufactured by iCONi SANTO CHEMICAL CORPORATION. The opacifiers are frequently used in an amount from. 0,3 to 1,5 . The compositions herein can also contain known antioxidants for their known utility, frequently radical scaven gers, in the art established levels i.e. 0,001 to 0,25 by reference to total composition . These antioxidants are frequently introduced in conjunction with the fatty acids.While many suitable antioxidants are readily known and available for that purpose especially preferred for use in the compositions herein are 2,6 ditertiary butyl p cresol, more commonly known as butylated hydroxytoluene, BHT, and 2tertiarybutyl 4 hydroxyanisole or 3 tertiarybutyl 4 hydroxyanisole more commonly known as BHA or butylated hydroxyanisole.Other suitable antioxidants are 4,4 thiobis 6 tert butyl mcresol and 2 methyl 4,6 dinonyl phenol. The following examples illustrate the invention and facilitate its understanding. All parts, percentages and ratios herein are by weight unless otherwise specified.
