# Rotating seal for gas turbine engine.

## Abstract
The cavity 34 between the first stage and second stage turbines of a gas turbine power plant is sealed by a rotating seal 22 characterized by an I beam section annular member spanning therebetween to transmit the axial load through the upper rim 24 and the radial load through the lower rim 52 of the annular member. A hammer head 44 conically mounted on the edge of the upper rim 24 locks in the first stage rear side plate and a gap between the lower rim 52 and second stage turbine pressure balances the I section.
