## Description
l Drying m.ixing drum for preparing bituminous mix, particularly by use of recovered mat.er ial . The prevent invent ion relates to a drying mixing drum for preparing bituminous mix, particularl.y by use of recovered material. It is known the present trend to reuse the material recovered from asphalt pavements to prepare new bituminous mix ready for the use E.S.D. A. System . There are already available in the market several recycling plants, the main member of which is constituted by the dryingmixing drum, that is by a rotating cylinder provi.ded wi.th a burner, in which a suitable percent of recovered material and virgin material is subject to drying and mixing together w.ith bitumen, asphalt or other fluid cementing material. In connection with this drying mixing drum, in all the known plants there is the problem of avoidi.ng that a too high overheat ing of the bitumen contained in the recovered material causes the combustion or the degradation of the same bitumen, thereby damaging the characteristics thereof and giving rise to a product of bad quality. In a drum of known type the above said problem has been solved by introducing the recovered material into the middle section of the drum, far from the end in which the burner is arranged and the virgin material is introduced. The latter is brought to high temperature by the flame of the burner and then largely transmits the heat to the recovered material by contact when, from the middie section of the drum on, the mixing of the two materials begins.There results from this the ma in drawback of this known drum, which is to exploit only a half part of the drum for the mixing, with consequent low efficiency of the plant. Aloreover, it is absolutely necessary to employ a not negligible quantity of virgin material with consequent low percent of recovered material in the finished product. The working of the plant with only reco vered material is then quite inconceivable. In another drum of known type the same problem has been solved, on the contrary by providing the burner with a suitably bored flame shielding cone, which has the function of shielding the bi tun of the recovered material from the flame radiation and distributing the flow of hot gases evenly inside the drum, thereby preventing the formation of localized peaks of temperature, which would cause the combustion of the bitumen. All the material reco vered and virgin may thus be introduced into the drum near the burner and the whole extension of the drum may be exploited to obtain a product of good quality and with high percent of recove red material since the heating of the recovered material is direct, between gas and material, the absence of virgin material may even be conceived.On the other hand, as a consequence of the use of the flame shield, there are the drawbacks of an increased constructional complexity, a low thermal efficiency and the newels sity of a troubled work of removal of the flame shield in case of use of virgin material only. In view of such a state of the art, it is object of the present invent ion to realize a drying mixing drum, particularly suitable for the treatment of recovered mater iat, which drum combi nes the advantages of the constructional simplicity, the high efficiency with high percent of recovered material and the large and total xariability of the composition from all recovered mate rial to all virgin material with the most various intermediate percents. According to the invention, this object has be n reached by a drying mixing drum, comprising a rotating cylinder provi.ded with a charging end with axial burner and with a d.ischarg ing end, cha racterized in that it comprises means for controlling the amount of air fed to the burner at such a value as to allow dry.ing and mixing of the introduced material, but not the combusti.on and the degradation of the bitumen contained in the recovered materiaL possibly making part of said material. That is, air is fed to the burner at an almost stoichiometric ratio with the fuel to be burnt, so that a subitantially i.nert at mosphere, containing oxygen in negligible quantity, is produced inside the drmm. More precisely, according to a preferred embod.i.ment of the present invention, the above said means for controlling the amount of air consist in that the only feeding path for the en tire necessary air passes through the burner, which is provided in i.ts turn with means for forcing the air into the drum, adjusting the amount of the same according to the different requi.re nients. There are further provided means for mainta.ining inside the cylinder a selected positive pressure able to avoi.d secundary and uncontrolled infiltrations of air, which would occur if a pressure lower than that existing outside set up inside the drum. In this way, without any complicated mechanical device, the flame of the burner is put in condition to avoid damage of the bitumen of the recovered material, at the same time having the helpful effect of ensuring a suitabLe temperature for the drying and mixing of the material and, thereof, for the formation of the de.sirei bituminous mix.The whole material, both Inert and recovered, may thus be introduced near the burner, with consequent possibiLity of reaching hi.gh levels of efficiency with high per cents of recovered material and very good quality of the finished product. At the same time, without any .structural change but mere ly through suitable adjustment of the burner flame, the same drum may be enabled to work with virgin material only. An embodiment of the drum according to the invention is illu strated for better clarity, but without any limiting intention, in the enclosed drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows a drying mixing drum according to the invention in axial section along line I I of Fig. 2 Fig. 2 shows said drum in transversal section along line II II of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 shows the burner and the corresponding air forced feed group, included in said drum, from left with respect to Fig I. With reference to the drawings, there is shown a drying mixing drum, which basically comprises a long cylinder 1 provided with a pair of rings 2 and 3 for its support by means of suitable groups of idle rollers and with a central toothed ring4 for its slow ro tation by means of suitable motor driven pinion.Inside the cylin der l, fixed to the internal wall thereof, there are arranged a plurality of longitudinal tongues 5, whose function is to homoge nize the material during its movement caused by the inclination of the longitudinal axis of the cylinder, from one end to the other of the same cylinder. The cylinder I has a charging end 20 on the right, looking at Fig. I, which is closed by a cover 6 and to which a burner 7, a material supply hopper 8 and a feed pipe 9 for fluid cementing ma terial, in particularly bitumen, are associated. The burner 7 has its mouth 10 housed in a chamber 11 together with a small tube 12 for the formation of a pilot flame for the firing of the burner. Sa id mouth is fed in known manner with su table fuel and further receives the necessary air for the combustion through one feed way 13, to which a prefixed flow of air is delivered in forced and controlled manner by a fan 14 w.ith a motor 15, which fan sucks air from a variable width mouth 16 in the sense of the arrow F of Fig. 3. The hopper 8, in its turn, is provided with a pair of feed chutes 17, which, by diverging progressively from one another, bring the material to diametrally opposed points of the charging end of the cylinder 1 fig. 2 . As shown in Fig. 1, there are arranged inclined radial tongues 18, which distri.bute the material along the circumference of the cylinder and on the several longitudinal tongues 5. The pipe 9, in its turn, enters inside the cylinder 1 and deve lops parallely to the axis thereof to such a distance that Its delivery flow is not directly affected by the burner flame. At the charging end of the cylinder 1 there is finally arranged a pressure sensor 19, which is schematically illustrated inFig. 1. The cylinder 1 has moreover a discharging end 21 on the left, looking at Fig. 1 , wh.i.ch includes a discharging mouth 22, from which a smoke sucking pipe 23 goes off. In said pipe 23 there .i.s inserted a throttle valve 24 driven by a motor 25 controlled by the pressure sensor 19. In the operation, a pref.ixed percent of recovered aggregate nnd virgin aggregate for example, 70 and 30 , respectively is introduced into the drum through the hopper 8 and distributed along the circumference of the cylinder 1 by means of the i.ncLined tongues 18. By suitable adjustment. of the amount of air for ced thrortgh the burner 7 by the fan 14 and with a suitablts pres sure maintained by the valve 24, adjusted by the signal detected by the pressure sensor 19 in the charging end 20, it is acted in such a way that the burner has available a suitably metered a mount of oxygen and secondary sucti ons of air by negative pressu re occur.The flame of the burner 7 is thus able to produce a suf ficient temperature to dry and mix the introduced material, to which bitumen or other fluid cementing materiaL introduced through the pipe 9 is added later on, but is not able to cause the combust ion of the bitumen contained in the recovered aggregate. The entire cylinder is therefore used for mi.xing the materi airs, thus obtaining consequently a finished product of good quali ty with h igh percent of recovered material. The bituminous mix thus obtained is finally discharged through the outlet mouth 22. On the other hand, it is clear that the drum illustrated in the drawings can promptly be used also for the production of bituminous mix starting from virgin material only. In such case, in fact, it is sufficient to adjust suitably the flame produced by the burner.
