# Anchored earth structure.

## Abstract
An earth mass forming an embankment, bridge abutment or the like has a facing of light concrete panels 1 from which steel rods 8 project into the earth mass, the ends of the rods being bent in one direction and then the other in the same plane to form anchors 8 which will oppose thrust on the fac ing but will permit deposition of earth fill in layers with each lay er capable of being readily compacted without interference from the anchors 8 . The rods extend through the panels in extended slots 6 5 to accommodate earth settlement and are secured thereto by nuts. The facings are desirably lap joint ed laterally and the anchors 8 extend through adjacent over lapping portions.
