# Jigs for locating electrical components.

## Abstract
The invention in a tool for accurately positioning a flat pack multi lead component to a PCB during soldering of the leads. The tool has a double function in providing both an accurate location for the board and the component whilst re flow soldering takes place. It also provides fool proof orientation of the component. The basis of the tool is four lo cating pins which locate at the corners of a square flat pack component but each pin is accurately made and positioned to locate the end leads of the two adjacent sides with a small clearance from the moulded body itself. This takes account of variations in the moulded bodies. One corner of the square body is chamfered and one of the pins is similarly shaped to ensure correct orientation.
