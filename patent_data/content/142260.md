# Lawn sprinkler.

## Abstract
A lawn sprinkler has a base 10 through which water is directed to a nozzle which directs the water vertically upwardly onto a water dispersing member 28 which is rotat ably mounted on a vertical spindle 46 . The water impinges first upon a convexly curved surface 52 whence it is deflected onto a concavely curved surface 54 . The reaction to the force of the water on the dispersing member 28 causes the latter to rotate on the spindle 46 , so that water droplets are flung off the edge of the concave surface 54 through a range of angles of inclination as the dispersing member rotates to afford 360 coverage around the sprinkler.
