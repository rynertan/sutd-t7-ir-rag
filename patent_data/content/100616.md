# Fluoride toothpastes.

## Abstract
A fluoride toothpaste comprises a kaolin abrasive which is at least 80 calcined and which has a particle size distribution such that the majority of particles are between 1 and 10 microns, and not more than 35 are under 1 micron, in diameter. The resulting toothpaste shows surprising efficacy in terms of fluoride availability, fluoride uptake on human enamel, enamel solubility reduction and polishing and stain removal.
