# Process of recovering polymeric beads from an aqueous slurry thereof.

## Abstract
Process of recovering polymeric beads from an aqueous slurry thereof, containing a poly vinyl alcohol dispersion stabiliser, by a physical separation such as filtration the process can be seriously impeded by blinding of the filter bed, reducing throughput rates to an intolerably low level. In order to achieve an efficient dewatering, an insoluble organic destabiliser is formed in situ in the slurry from a soluble parent compound comprising solubilising ionisable groups. The slurry may then be filtered at a temperature not lower than 50 C to yield a soft cake of polymer beads, essentially free of poly vinyl alcohol dispersion stabiliser.
