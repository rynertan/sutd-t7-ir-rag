# Double heterojunction field effect transistors.

## Abstract
The gate 6 of a double heterojunction FET is formed of heavily doped semiconductor material of the same conduc tivity type as that of the source and drain regions 3, 4 . An ohmic contact 7 can be made to the gate. The gate 6 and channel regions of the FET have the same barrier height relative to an intervening semiconductor layer 5 . If the intervening semiconductor layer 5 is undoped, the device has a threshold voltage of near zero volts. The threshold voltage can be increased or decreased by adding an n or p type dopant to the intervening semiconductor layer 5 .
