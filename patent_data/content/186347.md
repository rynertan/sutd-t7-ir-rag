## Description
The invention pertains to an universal method for producing high active biologically active compounds by immobilization with a covalent linkage on macroporous polymeric carriers in the presence of higher concentrations of inorganic salts. Research and application of immobilized biologically active compounds represents nowadays an extensive field comprising both development and application projects of considerable practical importance. The preparation and application of insoluble enzymes by bonding a soluble enzyme to a carrier enables to use the catalyst system repeatedly in a batch or through flow arrangement of reaction in which the insoluble enzyme has a role of the specific heterogeneous catalyst. Such arrangement of the catalytic enzymatic reaction facilitates the subsequent separation of the enzyme from substrate and reaction products and lowers the cost and enables to automate the process in the multiple or continuous performance. The rate of enzymatically catalyzed reaction depends, in the interaction of a substrate with the covalently immobilized enzyme, also on the character of linkage enzyme carrier, on physical and chemical properties of the carrier the size and distribution of pores, hydrophilicity of surface, etc. . Hydrodynamic parameters of the system, the flow rate of substrate, temperature, and others also significantly influence the final yield of reaction. The detailed knowledge of the factors affecting enzymatically catalyzed reactions utilizing the immobilized enzymes was obtained also in investigation the processes in preparative scale penicillinacylase I. CHIBATA, Immobilized Enzymes, J. Wiley and Sons, New York 1870 . Immobilized biologically active compounds have found a very broad application in the affinity chromatography. This method employs the capacity of numerous biologically efficient efficient compounds to form sorption complexes with other compounds, while the character of interaction is very specific and reversible. If one of the components of a sorption complex is bonded to a solid carrier, only such compounds are selectively adsorbed from solution under suitable conditions which are noted for the specific affinity to the bonded compound. The sorption complex may be easily separated from other components in solution by means of the carrier. Dissociation of the sorption complex and separation of the soluble component from the component which remains chemically bonded to the carrier occur by changing the conditions pH, ionic strength, temperature, addition of competitive sorbates, and the like . This procedure finds its use in the isolation and purification of enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, antidotes, antigens, soluble proteins, etc. Immobilization of bioactive compounds is advantageously used in biochemical analysis in the application of radioactive labelled compounds or in optical labelling. Numerous materials are used as carriers of biologically active compounds, for example, porous glass, silica gel, activated carbon, cellulose and its derivatives, starch, agarose, crosslinked polydextrans, synthetic polymers and copolymers as polyacrylamide, polystyrene, polyamides, poly maleic anhydride , polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, etc. Some types are unsuitable because they carry ionogenic functional groups, other are noted for their strong nonspecific sorption properties for proteins. Other types have insufficient mechanical, hydrolytical, microbial or thermal stability or unsuitable distribution of pore size. These features considerably narrow their region of application. Homogeneous hydrophilic carriers of polysaccharide type mostly must not dry out, which fact makes difficult their storage and transportation. The immobilization of enzymes on hydroplulic carriers off polysaccharide type in the presence of inorganic salts such as NH₄ ₂SO₄ has been described see e.g. Biotech. Bioeng. VOL.26, May 1984, pp.412 418 Most of the above mentioned shortcomings are overcome in carriers prepared by copolymerization of 2 hydroxyalkyl methacrylates with alkylene dimethacrylates, which are activated for the purpose of immobilization reaction by substitution on the hydroxyl group J. Coupek, J. Turkova, O. Hubalkova, M. Krivakova Czechoslovak Patent No. 167,530 . Further detailed studies concerning the mechanism of immobilization of biologically active compounds revealed that the covalent linkage has to be as stable as possible towards hydrolysis, which cannot be satisfied, for example, by activation with cyanogen bromide or by amide, sulfide, ester or other bonding groups. Immobilization utilizing reactive epoxide groups according to the following scheme proved most suitable Experiments with immobilization on the copolymer of glycidyl methacrylate with ethylene dimethacrylate J. Turkova, K. Blaha, M. Malanikova, D. Vajenerova, F. Svec and J. Kalal Biochem. Biophys. Acta 5424 1978 162 revealed that the reactive glycidyl methacrylate groups enclosed in a strongly crosslinked matrix of copolymer cannot be wholly employed for immobilization and that their subsequent deactivation is difficult. Therefore, a macroparous copolymer of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate with ethylene dimethacrylate was advantageously used as a carrier which was activated with epichlorohydrine and contains epoxypropyl functional groups only on the inner surface of porous J. Turkova, K. Blaha, J. Horacek, J. Vajener, A. Frydrychova and J. Coupek J. Chromatogr. 215 1981 165 179 and on the surface of particles. However, the yield of immobilized activity was rather low in some cases of direct bonding of protein on the epoxypropyl derivative of the hydroxyethyl methacrylate copolymer. This shortcoming, which occurs also in several other known activations of synthetic polymeric carriers, is removed by the subject of this invention. According to the invention there is provided a method for producing highly active immobilized biologically active compounds useful for chemical transformation of compounds by enzymatic catalysis and for preparative and analytical separation techniques, by means of a hydrolytically stable covalent linking of said biologically active compounds to macro porous polymeric carriers selected from the group comprising copolymers of hydroxyalkyl methacrylates C₂ to C₆ alkyl with alkylene dimethacrylate C₂ to C₄ alkylene , copolymers of styrene with divinylbenzene or alkylene dimethacrylate C₂ to C₄ alkylene , copolymers of glycydil methacrylate with alkylene dimethacrylate. C₂ to C₄ alkylene , porous glass, and silica gel, said method comprising linking said biologically active compounds to the activated macroporous polymeric carrier in the presence of solutions of inorganic salts added in a concentration from 1.25 to 3 mol l, the given concentration of inorganic salts present in the bonding reaction causing a two step reaction, whereby a hydrophobic adsorption of the biologically active compound on carrier occurs in the first step and then, in the second step, the biologically active compound reacts with functional groups of the carrier, giving rise to a covalent linkage. The said concentration of inorganic salts in the bonding reaction causes reduction or elimination of a solvation envelope of protein molecules. The macroporous polymeric carriers are selected from the groups comprising synthetic copolymers of hydroxyalkyl methacrylates C₂ to C₆ alkyl with alkylene dimethacrylate C₂ to C₄ alkylene , copolymers of styrene with divinylbenzene or alkylene dimethacrylate C₂ to C₄ alkylene , copolymers of glycidyl methacrylate with ethylene dimethacrylate, porous glass, and silica gel. The polymeric carrier has to be activated prior to the immobilization reaction. Reactive functional groups are selected from the group, comprising epoxides, aldehydes primary or secondary amines, carboxyls and thiols. The macroporous polymeric carrier has advantageously a rigid structure and sperical shape. To confirm the effect of the invention, they were chosen the compounds comprised in the group of enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, and also immunoactive proteins. Salts, the presence of which in bonding of bioactive compounds substantially increases the yield of bonded protein and the yield of activity, are selected from the group comprising ammonium and sodium sulfates and phosphates. Reaction temperature is given by the reactivity of functional groups of the carrier and the bioactive compound determined for immobilization and is in the interval 5 C to 30 C. The reaction proceeds at pH 3 10 for 0.5 to 40 hours. The method for immobilization of biologically active compounds in the presence of higher concentrations of inorganic salts according to the invention is highly universal and its mechanism was studied in details and confirmed with numerous biologically active compounds of various nature.
