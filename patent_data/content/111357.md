# A container or a cover for a container having at least a ployolefin surface provided with a mark of decomposed polyolefin.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a method of marking articles having a polyolefin surface by exposure to a laser beam. The polyolefin contains a sufficient amount of a laser radiation absorbing substance for decomposing the polyolefin so that a black mark of decomposed polyolefin will be formed. The laser radiation absorbing substance is a silicon compound, preferably a metal silicate, e.g. calcium metasilicate or kaoline. The invention also comprises an article having a polyole fin surface provided with a black mark of decomposed polyolefin formed by a laser beam.
