Although the compounds of Formula I are shown as being fully sulfated, this invention contemplates partially sulfated ptoducts. The invention further relates to novel compounds of the following formula EMI2.1 wherein Y isEMI2.2 orEMI3.1 A, B and Z are as described in Formula I W is H or COCH3 and R is CH2OW COOH or COOCH3 In the above Formulas I and II the invention is intended to include disaccharides consisting of aldohexoses, ketohexoses, aldopentoses and the like as well as oligosaccharides wherein the sugar units are 2 8 consisting of maltotrioses, maltotetraoses, maltopentaoses and the like. The term complement refers to a complex group of proteins in body fluids that, working together with antibodies or other factors, play an important role as mediators of immune, allergic, immunochemical and or immunopathological reactions. The reactions in which complement participates take place in blood serum or in other body fluids, and hence are considered to be humoral reactions. With regard to human blood, there are at present more than 20 proteins in the complement system consisting of the so called classical and alternative pathways. These complement proteins are generally designated by the letterC and by number C1, C2, C3 and so on up to C9. The complement protein C1 is actually an assembly of subunits designated Clq, Clr and Cls. The numbers assigned to the complement proteins reflect the sequence in which they become active, with the exception of complement proteinC4, which reacts after C1 and before C2. The numerical assignments for the proteins in the complement system were made before the reaction sequence was fully understood. A more detailed discussion of the complement system and its biochemical, biological and pathological role in the body processes can be found in, for example, Bull. W.H. 0. 39 935 1968 Annu. Rev. Med. 19 1 1968 Johns Hopkins Med. J. 128 57 1971 Harvey Lect. 66 75 1972 N.Engl. J. Med. 287 452, 489, 545, 592, 642 1972 Sci.Am. 229 5 54 1973 Fed.

Rev.1 483 1979 . The complement system e.g., classical pathway can be considered to consist of three subsystems 1 a recognition unit Clq which enables it to combine with antibody molecules that have detected a foreign invader 2 an activation unit Clr, Cls, C2, C4, C3 which prepares a site on the neighboring membrane and 3 an attack unit C5, C6, C7. C8 and C9 which creates a hole in the membrane. The membrane attack unit is nonspecific it destroys invaders only because it is generated in their neighborhood. In order to minimize damage to the host s own cells, its activity must be limited in time. This limitation is accomplished partly by the spontaneous decay of activated complement and partly by interference by inhibitors and destructive enzymes.The control of complement, however, is not perfect, and there are times when damage is done to hosts cells. Immunity is, therefore, a double edged sword. Activation of the complement system also accelerates blood clotting. This action comes about by way of the complement mediated release of a clotting factor from platelets. The biologically active complement fragments and complexes can become involved in reactions that damage the host s cells. These pathogenic reactions can result in the development of immune complex diseases. For example, in some forms of nephritis, complement damages the basal membrane of the kidney, resulting in the escape of protein from the blood into the urine. The disease disseminated lupus erythematosus belongs in this category its symptoms include nephritis, visceral lesions and skin eruptions. The treatment of diphtheria or tetanus with the injection of large amounts of antitoxin sometimes results in serum sickness, an immune complex disease.Rheumatoid arthritis also involves immune complexes. Like disseminated lupus erythematosus, it is an autoimmune disease in which the disease symptoms are caused by pathological effects of the immune system in the host s tissues. In summary, the complement system has been shown to be involved with inflammation, coagulation, fibrinolysis, antibody antigen reactions and other metabolic processes. In the presence of antibody antigen complexes the complement proteins are involved in a series of reactions which may lead to irreversible membrane damage if they occur in the vicinity of biological membranes.Thus, while complement constitutes a part of the body s defense mechanism against infection it also results in inflammation and tissue damage in the immunopatholoqical process. The nature of certain complement proteins, suggestions regarding the mode of complement binding to biological membranes and the manner in which complement effects membrane damage are discussed in Annu. Rev.Biochem. 38 389 1969 J. Exp. Med. 141 724 1975 J. Immunol. 116 1431 1976 119 1, 1195, 1358, 1482 1977 120 1841 1978 Immunochemistry 115 813 1978 J. Biol. Chem. 254 9908 1979 . A variety of substances have been disclosed as inhibiting the complement system, ifs., as complement inhibitors.

The compounds of the present invention may be administered internally, e.g., orally, intra articularly or parenterally, to a warm blooded animal to inhibit complement in the body fluid of the animal, such inhibition being useful in the amelioration or prevention of those reactions dependent upon the function of complement, such as inflammatory process and cell membrane damage induced by antigen antibody complexes. A range of doses may be employed depending on the mode of administration, the condition being treated and the particular compound being used. For example, for intravenous or subcutaneous use from about 5 to about 50 mg kg day, or every six hours for more rapidly excreted salts, may be used.For intra articular use for large joints such as the knee, from about 2 to about 20 mg joint week may be used, with proportionally smaller doses for smaller joints. The dosage range is to be adjusted to provide optimum therapeutic response in the warm blooded animal being treated. In general, the amount of compound administered can vary over a wide range to provide from about 5 mg kg to about 100 mg kg of body weight of animal per day. The usual daily dosage for a 70 kg subject may vary from about 350 mg to about 3.5 g. Unit doses of the acid or salt can contain from about 0.5 mg to about 500 mg. The compounds of the present invention may also be administered topically in the form of ointments, creams, lotions and the like, suitable for the treatment of complement dependent dermatological disorders. Moreover, the compounds of the present invention may be administered in the form of dental pastes, ointments, buccal tablets and other compositions suitable for application periodontally for the treatment of periodontitis and related diseases of the oral cavity. In therapeutic use, the compounds of this invention may be administered in the form of conventional pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions may be formulated so as to be suitable for oral or parenteral administration.The active ingredient may be combined in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, i.e., oral or parenteral. The compounds can be used in compositions such as tablets. Here, the principal active ingredient is mixed with conventional tabletting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, gums, or similar materials as nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable diluents or carriers. The tablets or pills of the novel compositions can be laminated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged or delayed action or predetermined successive action of the enclosed medication.For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids or mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, shellac and cetyl alcohol, cellulose acetate and the like. A particularly advantageous enteric coating comprises a styrene maleic acid copolymer together with known materials contributing to the enteric properties of the coating. The tablet or pill may be colored through the use of an appropriate nontoxic dye, so as to provide a pleasing appearance. The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration include suitable flavored emulsions with edible oils, such as, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, peanut oil, and the like, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Sterile suspensions or solutions can be prepared for parenteral use. Isotonic preparations containing suitable preservatives are also desirable for injection use. The term dosage form, as described herein, refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosage for warm blooded animal subjects, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active component calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical diluent, carrier or vehicle. The specification for the novel dosage forms of this invention are indicated by characteristics of the active component and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved or the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active component for therapeutic use in warm blooded animals as disclosed in this specification. Examples of suitable oral dosage forms in accord with this invention are tablets, capsules, pills, powder packets, granules, wafers, cachets, teaspoonfuls, dropperfuls, ampules, vials, segregated multiples of any of the foregoing and other forms as herein described.
