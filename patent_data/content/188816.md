As stated above, the beta lactam compounds I of the invention are useful as the intermediates for production of l alkylcarbapenem compounds. For instance, a compound of the formula EMI13.2 wherein R1, R2, R3, Y and Z are each as defined above, X is a hydrogen atom or a protected hydroxyl group and R4 is a carboxyl or thiolcarboxyl protecting group, which covers the compounds I 4 and I 7 as well as the corresponding compounds derived therefrom, when the symbol X represents a hydroxyl group, by protection of such hydroxyl group in a per se conventional procedure, may be used as the starting material, which is converted into the l alkylcarbapenem compound I in various ways, of which typical examples are shown below. Procedure 1 EMI14.1 wherein R1, R2, R , X , Y and Z are each as defined above and is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group. The beta lactam compound I 8 is treated with a base in an inert solvent to give the compound VI . When R3 is a lower alkyl group, there can be obtained as the major product the compound VI retaining the steric configuration based on the asymmetric carbon atom at the 5 position bonding to the 4 position of the beta lactam ring in the starting compound I 8 . As the inert solvent, there may be used ethers e.g. diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether , aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, toluene , acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoric triamide HMPT , t butanol, etc. These solvents may be used solely or in combination.Preferred examples of the base are metal salts of amines e.g. lithium diisopropylamide, lithium bis trimethylsilyl amide, sodium amide , metal salts of alcohols e.g.potassium t butoxide , alkali metal hydrides e.g. sodium hydride, potassium hydride , sodium methylsulfinylmethide, etc. The base is to be used in such an amount that the reaction can proceed smoothly, and it may be usually from 1.5 to 3 equivalents to the starting compound I80 . The reaction temperature may be accelerated or controlled by heating or cooling, and it may be normally from 75 to 500C. Rcovery of the produced compound VI from the reaction mixture may be accomplished by application of a per se conventional procedure for post treatment. However, post treatment of the reaction mixture should be sometimes effected with special care, because, for instance, the alkyl group at the l position of the compound of the formula EMI15.1 wherein R1, R2, R 3, R 4, X and Y are each as defined above may be epimerized on treatment with a base or during concentration. l a The thus produced compound VI wherein Y is an oxygen atom can be converted into the corresponding l alkylcarbapenem compound having an antimicrobial activity according to the following route EMI16.1 wherein R1, R2, R3 , R1 and X are each as defined above and R3, 4 X is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group and R is an 0 organic group. The compound VI is first converted into the carbapenem compound VII by the procedure as described inU.S. Patent 4,350,631, European Patent 54,917 or JapanesePatent Publication unexamined No. 123182782 or any similar procedure thereto. Then, the resulting carbapenem compound VII may be, if necessary, subjected to elimination of the hydroxyl protecting group, elimination of the carboxyl protecting group and or elimination of the amino protecting group to give the carbapenem compound VIII . Elimination of the protecting group may be accomplished by a per se conventional procedure, although it is varied with the kind of the protecting group. When, for instance, the hydroxyl protecting group and the nitrogenprotecting group in the compound VII are halogenated lower alkoxycarbonyl or ar lower alkoxycarbonyl or the carboxyprotecting group in the compound VII are halogenated lower alkyl, ar lower alkyl or benhydryl, it may be eliminated by application of an appropriate reduction. Such reduction may be effected using zinc with acetic acid, tetrahydrofuran or methanol in case of the protecting group being halo lower alkoxycarbonyl or halo lower alkyl, or using a catalyst such as platinum or palladium carbon in case of the protecting group being ar lower alkyloxycarbonyl, ar lower alkyl or benzhydryl. In the case using a catalyst as stated above, the reduction is normally effected in an inert solvent chosen from lower alkanols e.g. methanol, ethanol , ethers e.g.tetrahydrofuran, dioxane , organic acids e.g. acetic acid , water and buffers e.g. phosphate buffer, morpholinopropanesulfonate buffer , etc. These solvents may be used solely or in combination. The reaction temperature may be usually from 0 to 1000C, preferably from 0 to 400C. The hydrogen pressure may be an atmospheric or elevated one. Still, such a protecting group as o nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl or o nitrobenzyl may be eliminated also by photo reaction. l b The compound VI wherein Y is a sulfur atom can be converted into the corresponding carbapenem compound according to the following route EMI18.1 wherein R1, R2, R3 , R4 , R4, Ro, X and X are each as defined above. The compound VI is first converted into the carbapenem compound VII in the same manner as in l a . Then, the carbapenem compound VII may be, if necessary, subjected to elimination of various protecting groups. As to a thioester group, the application of a per se conventional hydrolytic procedure can successfully accomplish its elimination giving the carbapenem compound VIII . Instead of application of the hydrolytic procedure, treatment with a silyl compound such as silanol may be applied to the carba penem compound VII so that the carbapenem compound VIII can be obtained directly. Alternatively, the carbapenem compound VII may be treated with an alcohol in the presence of a silver salt e.g. silver trifluoroacetate to give the compound VII , which is then treated in the same manner as in l a to give the carbapenem compound VIII . In the substituent SR of the carbapenem compounds 0 VII and VII , R0 may be any one as heretofore used in connection with carbapenem compounds, and its examples include substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or alkenyl having 1 to 10 carbon atoms cycloalkyl, alkylcycloalkyl or cycloalkylalkyl in which the cycloalkyl group has 3 to 6 carbon atoms aryl e.g. phenyl , aralkyl wherein the aryl group is phenyl and the alkyl portion has 1 to 6 carbon atoms heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl or heterocycloalkyl, etc. These groups may be optionally bear thereon at least one substituent chosen from amino, mono , di or trialkylamino, hydroxyl, alkoxy, mercapto, alkylthio, arylthio e.g.phenylthio , sulfamoyl, amidino, guanidino, nitro, halo e.g. chloro, bromo, fluoro , cyano and carboxyl. In said substituents having a hetero ring, the hetero atom s in the hetero ring may be chosen from oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur, and their number may be from 1 to 4. The alkyl moiety in said substituents may have 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Procedure 2 EMI20.1 wherein R1, R2, R3 , R4 , X , Y and Z are each as defined above and L is an activated hydroxyl group such as an active ester of hydroxyl, B is an alkali metal atom and R A is an alkylating or acylating agent. For direct production of the compound IX from the compound I80 , the latter is treated as in Procedure 1 . Without isolation of the product, the reaction mixture is treated with an alkylating or acylating agent e.g. iodomethane, iodopropane, allyl bromide, benzyl bromide, methyl p toluene sulfonate so as to catch the residue of the activating group such as an active ester residue, an active acid anhydride residue or a thiol residue, followed by treatment with a hydroxyl activating agent such as an active esterifying agent for hydroxyl to give the carbapenem compound IX . The treatment with the alkylating or acylating agent is preferably carried out in the presence of a base in an inert solvent. As the active ester of hydroxyl represented by the symbol L, there are exemplified substituted or unsubstituted arylsulfonic esters e.g. benzenesulfonic esters, p toluenesulfonic esters, p nitrobenzenesulfonic esters, p bromobenzenesulfonic esters , lower alkanesulfonic esters e.g.methanesulfonic esters, ethanesulfonic esters , halo lower alkanesulfonic esters e.g. trifluoromethanesulfonic esters , diarylphosphoric esters e.g. diphenylphosphoric esters , halides equal to esters with hydrogen halides e.g. chlorides, bromides, iodides , etc. Preferred are p toluenesulfonic esters, methanesulfonic esters, diphenylphosphoric esters, etc. Accordingly, any reagent which is reacted with the compound VI 2 to give the active ester as exemplified above may be used as the active esterifying agent. Examples of the alkali metal atom represented by the symbol B are lithium, sodium, potassium, etc. As the base, there may be used the one as exemplified in Proceudre 1 for production of the compound VI . When the symbol R03 in the compound I 80 is a lower alkyl group, its treatment with a base in an inert solvent affords the enolate salt VI 2 , which retains the steric configuration on the basis of the asymmetric carbon atom at the 5 position of the compound I8O . Even after conversion of the enolate VI 2 into the compound IX , the steric configuration of the alkyl group represented by the symbol R3 is unchanged. Thus, adoption of this Procedure 2 gives the carbapenem compound IX without epimerization. Still, the enolate VI 2 in this case has a possibility of taking a chelate structure of the formula EMI22.1 ll wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, X , Y and B are each as defined above. The active esterifying agent is to be used in an amount sufficient to effect the reaction smoothly, and its amount may be from 1 to 1.5 equivalents to the compound I80 . The reaction temperature may be usually from 78 to 600C, preferably from 40 to 100C. Procedure 3 EMI23.1 wherein R1, R2, PO R Ro, R A, B, X , Y and Z are each as 3 4 defined above. When direct production of the carbapenem compound VII from the compound I 8 is desired, the latter may be converted into the carbapenem compound IX in the same manner as Procedure 2 . Without isolation of the compound IX , the reaction mixture is treated with a mercaptan compound of the formula R0 SH X wherein R0 is as defined above in the presence of a base to give the carbapenem compound VII . The base to be used in the treatment with the mercaptan compound X may be the same as or different from that as used in the cyclization of the compound I 80 to the compound IX . Likewise, the inert solvent to be used in said treatment may be the same as or different from that as used in said cyclization. As the base, there may be used the one chosen from those as exemplified in Procedure 1 . Other examples of the base usuable are organic amines such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, 4 dimethylaminopyridine, 1,8 diazabicyclo 5.4.0 7 undecene DBU , 1,5 diazabicyclo 4.3.0 5 nonene DBN and 1,4 diazabicyclo 2.2.23octane DABCO .Preferred examples of the solvent which is used for smooth proceeding of the reaction are acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, etc. The base to be used together with the mercaptan compound X may be employed in such an amount as can assure the smooth proceeding of the reaction, and its amount may be in a large excess, preferably from 1 to 2 equivalents to the compound I8O . The mercaptan compound X and the base may be introduced into the reaction system separately. Alternatively, the salts formed between them may be added to the reaction system. Conversion of the beta lactam compound I 80 into the carbapenem compound IX may be accomplished by carrying out the reactions as above explained in order. When desired, the carbapenem compound IX is subjected to hydrolysis or elimination of the protecting group so that the carbapenem compound VII can be obtained. The hydrolysis or the elimination of the protecting group may be carried out in the same manner as in Procedure 1 a i.e. conversion of the compound VII into the compound VIII or l b i.e. conversion of the compound VII into the compound VIII . A typical example of the conversion from the betalactam compound I 801 into the l beta methylcarbapenem compound is shown below EMI26.1 wherein R , Y, Z , B, R A, L and R0 are each as defined above and Rig is a hydroxyl protecting group. Namely, 1 the beta lactam compound I 8 is treated with a base in an inert solvent, 2 the residue Z is caught with an alkylating or acylating agent and then 3 the resulting product is treated with a hydroxyl activating group such as an active esterifying agent for hydroxyl.When desired, 4 the resultant product is reacted with the mercaptan compound X in the presence of a base or the salt of the mercaptan compound X with the base. These reactions may be carried out in a single reaction vessel in order to give the carbapenem compound IX or VII . Alternatively, the compound I 8 may be subjected to the reaction in 1 , followed by post treatment to give the compound of the formula EMI27.1 wherein R4 , Rlo and Y are each as defined above. The betamethyl group at the l position is apt to be epimerized when the product is stored in a high concentration solution or in a polar solvent such as acetonitrile. Thus, the stereospecific production of the compound IX from the compound VI as once isolated in a large scale would have a technical problem.To the contrary, the conversion of not the compound VI but the compound VI 2 into the compound IX is advantageous, because the production of the compound IX or VII can be accomplished without epimerization of the methyl group at the l beta position. The compound II as the starting material in production of the beta lactam compound I according to this invention can be produced in the manner as described in U.S.Patent 4,350,631, European Patent 54917 or Japanese PatentPublication unexamined No. 123182 82. For production of the compound II wherein Y is a sulfur atom, introduction of the SR4 group may be carried out by a conventional procedure as in the case of production of the compound 1 6 . While the starting compound IV can be produced in the same manner as described in European Patent 10317 orJapanese Patent Publication unexamined No. 89285 80, it may be produced according to the route as shown in the following scheme EMI28.1 EMI29.1 wherein R1, R2, X and X are each as defined above, R is a nitrogen protecting group, A is a halogen atom and P is a hydroxyl protecting group. In the above scheme, the step A is directed to conversion of the carboxylic acid 1 into the corresponding ester 2 . The conversion is usually carried out by application of a per se conventional esterification procedure.For instance, the carboxylic acid 1 obtained by the process as described in Japanese Patent Publication unexamined No. 96060 83 may be reacted with an alkyl halide in the presence of an acid eliminating agent or with an alkanol in the presence of a dehydrating agent to give the ester 2 . At the step B, the ester 2 is reduced by treatment with an organic metal compound such as magnesium halide or methyl lithium in an inert solvent, optionally followed by protection of a hydroxyl group in a per se conventional procdeure to give the corresponding alcohol 3 . At the step C, the alcohol 3 is dehydrated by treatment with a dehydrating agent such as thionyl chloride or tosyl chloride in the presence or absence of a base to give the corresponding methylene compound 4 . At the step D, the methylene compound 4 is halogenated by treatment with a halogenating agent such as molecular halogen or N halogenosuccinimide in an inert solvent to give the corresponding halogenated compound 5 . At the step E, the halogenated compound 5 is hydrolyzed by treatment with water in the presence of a low atomic valency ion salt of a heavy metal e.g. copper, silver to give the corresponding hydroxyl compound 6 . At the step F, the hydroxyl compound 6 is subjected to protection on the hydroxyl group to give the corresponding protected hydroxyl compound 7 . At the step G, the protected hydroxyl compound 7 is hydrogenated by catalytic hydrogenation to give the corresponding methyl compound 8 . At the step H, the methyl compound 8 is subjected to elimination of the hydroxyl protecting group represented by the symbol P and elimination of the aminoprotecting group represented by the symbol R simultaneously or stepwise to give the corresponding free compound IVa . In the beta lactam compound I , the carbon atoms at the 3 and 4 positions and the carbon atom bonding to the beta lactam ring and in the substituent attached to the 4 position of such beta lactam ring are all asymmetric carbon atoms. Further, in the case that all of R1, R2 and X are different one another e.g. R1 methyl, R2 hydrogen,X hydroxyl , the carbon atom bonding to the beta lactam ring and in the substituent attached to the 3 position of such beta lactam ring is an asymmetric carbon atom.Accordingly, the beta lactam compound of the formula I covers optical isomers and stereo isomers due to said asymmetric carbon atoms. Among those optical isomers and stereo isomers, the compounds of the following formula EMI31.1 wherein R3, R4 and Y and Z are each as defined above are particularly preferred in having the same configuration as that of naturally occuring thienamycin on the carbon atom at the 4 position. Practical and presently preferred embodiments of the invention are illustratively shown in the followingExamples and References Examples. This invention is, however, not limited to these examples.
