# Lock up control system for lock up type automatic transmission.

## Abstract
A lock up control system for a lock up type automatic transmission of an automotive vehicle. The lock up control system functions to temporally release lock up operation of a torque converter of the transmission upon occurrence of a gear shift signal even if the automotive vehicle is operating within any one of lock up ranges. Gear shifting detector means 207, 208, 218, 219, 217 207a c, 208a c, 218a c, 219a c generates a gear shift signal having a duration which is variable corresponding to the duration of a corresponding gear shifting operation. The duration of the gear shift signal generated by the gear shifting signal may be variable also with the magnitude of engine load.
