# AIRBED MATTRESS INCLUDING A REGULATED, CONTROLLABLE AIR RESERVOIR THEREFOR

## Abstract
An airbed mattress is maintained at a constant pressure by means of an air reservoir 1 connected with a pressure regulat ing apparatus. In one embodiment an outlet 6 from the air reservoir is connected with an air manifold 7 which supplies the mattress with air. A pump 5 supplies air to the reservoir 1 via a one way check valve 4 . As the pressure inside the air reservoir 1 , and therefore the mattress, recedes a platform 18 resting on the reservoir 1 and hinged about a point 17 is lowered to a position in which it throws a switch to actuate the pump 5 . As the pump 5 increases the pressure in the reservoir 1 , the reservoir 1 inflates thus raising the platform 18 to a position at which it throws a second switch 21 turning off the pump. An over pressure in the reservoir 1 is catered for by the platform resting on the over inflated reservoir 1 throwing a third switch 20 which opens a volume relief valve 2 . The maintained pressure inside the mattress is varied by moving a weight 19 on a motorised pulley 61 to exert a vary ing load on the air reservoir 1 .
