# Process for the production of high molecular weight polyester.

## Abstract
A process for the continuous production of high molecu lar weight polyethylene terephthalate wherein the crystal lized prepolymer having an intrinsic viscosity of at least .3 is dried, preheated and polymerized in a single moving bed reaction zone. The method is characterized by an inert gas atmosphere and a reaction zone with a temperature gradiant ranging from about 170 C. at the uppermost portion and a higher temperature of about 225 C. at the lowermost portion. The present invention is an improved process over the conventional one see Figure 2 . As in the conventional process, the prepolymer is placed in a feed hopper 11 after which the prepolymer is heated and crystallized in a conventional crystallizer 12 , but leaves the crystallizer at a higher temperature of about 170 C. to about 180 C. The crystallized polyester then enters the moving bed reaction zone 13 through the top and moves downward slowly by a gravitational force. A stream of hot gas enters the reaction zone through the bottom at a constant temperature slightly higher than in the conventional process, 225 as opposed to 220 C. The polyester will leave the bottom of the zone at a temperature slightly lower than the nitrogen inlet tempera ture, at or about 220 C. The hot oil in the jacket 14 of the reaction zone supplies heat to the prepolymer through the wall of the moving bed reaction zone. The polymer is then discharged into a product cooler 15 wherein the tempera ture of the polymer is lowered to about 65 C. The inert gas can optionally be recycled by using a conventional clean up system 16 . The recycled gas can then be fed into a heater 17 before entering a blower mechanism 18 whereupon the gas then enters the drier reactor 14 . Preferably the recycled gas can enter the blower 18 before entering the heater 17 whereupon the recycled gas enters the drier reactor 14 .
