# Radiation shield, furnace and method for shielding a furnace convection section.

## Abstract
A radiant shield which may comprise staggered bodies such as plates 60 , tubes or rods is useful for substantially blocking the line on sight between a radiant section 20 of a furnace and a convection section tubes 40 positioned above the radiant section, while at the same time permitting flue gases from the radiant section to travel substantially freely to the convection section. The staggered bodies may be supported by hangers 62 that are hung from convection tubes 40 in the convection section.
