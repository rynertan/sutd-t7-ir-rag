# Apparatus for loading plane film cassettes in daylight.

## Abstract
An apparatus 30 for loading plane film cassettes 10 in daylight conditions comprises a housing 31 having an inlet opening 32 through which the plane film cassette 10 is introduced. In the interior of the housing 31 is located a platform 34 and an abutment member 35 for aligning the cassette. Photographic material is supplied from a roll 37 and cut in predetermined lengths. The cut off portion of the photographic material is partly guided into the plane film cassette 10 , whereinafter a friction element 47 makes it completely disappear in the plane film cassette 10 which is subsequently closed, relocked and taken out of the housing 31 .
