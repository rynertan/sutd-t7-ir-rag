# Routing technique.

## Abstract
An address n is associated with a sort element 30 so that input signals are compared with each other, or with the address n in the case of a null input N . Several elements 30 are interconnected to provide unique signal routing from any input to a particular output, depending upon a character istic of an input signal itself without reference to other output signals.
