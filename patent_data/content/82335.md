# DIGITAL SINE WAVE SYNTHESIZING METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
A digital accumulator is driven at a basic counting rate to accumulate increments representative of phase with the total sum representative of total phase angle of a sine wave. The accumulator operates at a first rate until a total phase angle of approximately 45 is accumulated. Then accumulation value additions are at 1 2 the rate until 67.5 of total phase angle are accumulated. Then accumulation is at 1 4 the basic rate until 90 is reached. The symmetry of the sine wave allows the 0 through 90 samples to be used to generate the full 360 wave from by simple inversion or reverse counting of the counter and inversion of the algebraic sign as necessary. The resulting count is applied to a digital to analog converter to derive the output analog voltage. A binary slope approximation to the sine function is achieved by this technique.
