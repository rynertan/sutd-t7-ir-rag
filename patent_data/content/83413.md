# Autofocus arrangement for electron beam lithographic systems.

## Abstract
An automatic focus correction system for E beam litho graphy uses optical light from a narrow angle light source 10 to illuminate a horizontal slit 12 , the image of which is projected onto a target surface 15 . Prior to and after reflection of the slit image from the target surface the light beam is projected parallel to the target surface to minimize vertical space requirements in the E beam column. Varia tions in height, z position, cause the slit image to move vertically and the focus of reflection to shift laterally and this image is redeflected in the horizontal plane by a prism to a linear diode array 28 used to produce a video type output signal. Autofocus electronics are used to convert the video output signal into an analog correction signal to the E beam fine focus coil. The video type signal is also converted to a digital height value to be used for corrections in beam magnification and rotation.
