# Clutch disc having damper springs.

## Abstract
A clutch disc having at least two kinds of torsion damp er springs arranged circumferentially around a hub 1 of the clutch disc. First damper springs 11 have a spring constant smaller than that of second damper springs 9 . The first springs 11 and the second springs 9 are not arranged in series, and to end, in a circle, but the first springs 11 are arranged in parallel with the second springs 9 . The first springs 11 are wound around an annular wire guide 10 concentric with the hub 1 . In one embodiment, the annular wire guide 10 extends through the second springs 9 , and the first springs 11 are inserted in the second springs 9 , respectively. In another embodiment, the annular wire guide 10 is mounted on the outer periph ery of a flange 1a of the hub 1 outside the second springs 9 .
