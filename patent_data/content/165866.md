# Electrophotographic recorder controller.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for improving the quality of recordings from electrophotographic recording apparatuses by calculating the surface charge remaining on the recording medium adjacent the development electrode and adjusting the voltage of the development electrode to match the remaining surface charge controlling the corona charger to operate at two levels, a first level for charging the surface of the recording medium and a second lower level at which neither light nor ions are emitted controlling the fuser lamp in response to changes in ambient temperature, line voltage, and the rate of recording medium advancement to obtain optimum toner fusion without damage to the recording medium deactivating the toner pump and air knife blower if the recording medium has not moved for a predetermined period of time, and further including a development elec trode design for maintaining a uniform layer of toner adjacent the recording medium.
