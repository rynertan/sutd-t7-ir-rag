## Description
This invention relates to methods for verifying and providing information concerning merchandise in combatting counterfeiting and other practices associated with commercial distribution of the merchandise. Specific forms of anti counterfeiting devices and systems are described in WO 82 00062, and whereas such devices and systems have been found to be quite effective in combatting counterfeiting, merchandisers continue to face problems related to the distribution of their merchandise. For example, problems arise when anti counterfeit tags and labels are stolen or otherwise obtained for use in improperly authenticating counterfeit or unauthorized goods. Even after anti counterfeit tags or labels have been affixed to genuine goods, problems may arise during movement of those goods through an approved commercial distribution chain. Disparities, for example, may be found to occur between the quantities despatched from, and the quantities acknowledged as received at, successive stages of the chain. As well as the disappearance of genuine goods from the chain, there is the problem that counterfeit goods may be inserted into it in their place. Tracing goods that enter the distribution chain and, in particular, tracing any genuine goods that are missing from it and identifying where and how they became missing, is often difficult or impossible. Another problem arises where a manufacturer, in order to maintain certain standards, supplies only to authorised retailers. It is not uncommon in such circumstances for some authorised retailers to unload sizable quantities of the merchandise, sometimes at discounted prices, onto unauthorised retailers for sale in conditions outside the manufacturer s standards. It is in general very difficult or impossible for the manufacturer to trace the source of goods diverted in this way. As indicated above, the flow of merchandise within a commercial distribution chain is open to abuse, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a method that may be used to reduce the likelihood and opportunity for such abuse, in particular by auditing the historical status of individual units of merchandise within their commercial distribution chain. The method of the invention is defined in the appended claims, and as such is characterised against the background of prior art represented by the disclosure of FR A 2 438 297. FR A 2 438 297 describes a method of following the progress of workpiece units, each made up of bundles of clothing parts, through successive workstations of a manufacturing process, and recording data concerning that progress. A punched card is individually associated with each workpiece unit, and is used at the workstations to signal the presence of the respectively identified unit to a central computer so that information about the workpiece units, and their progress during manufacture of the clothing, can be determined from interrogation of the computer. The disclosed method, however, is not applicable to auditing the historical status of individual units of merchandise in a commercial distribution chain. The method of the present invention, in distinction to what is described in FR A 2 438 297, relates specifically to the commercial distribution of units of merchandise in batches. Moreover, each unit of a released batch in the method of the invention, has its own individually associated identification item which provides representation of identity dependent on the batch to which it belongs in FR A 2 438 297, the punched card identifies the bundle of clothing parts and not those parts individually. The distinctions are of practical and technical relevance in tracing units of a released batch for counteracting counterfeiting and other practices associated with abuse of commercial distribution. A method in accordance with the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring initially to FIGURE 1, a merchandise verification tag 10 is represented for use on a specific product or unit of merchandise. In various embodiments, the tag 10 may take the form of a label, product instructions, a certificate, a guarantee, or various other forms of documents associated with units of merchandise. The tag 10, illustrated somewhat as a label, comprises a sheet of fiber paper having as a characteristic, an innate variable pattern of light transmissivity. The pattern is measurable. Such patterns may be observed in common ordinary bond paper by holding a sheet up to a light source and viewing the light source through the paper. The fact that such a pattern is inherent and random in the natural composition of the sheet, renders it substantially unduplicable as a characteristic for the tag 10. The tag 10 is perforated to define three distinct sections. The major section 12 is separated from a section 14 by a line 16 of perforations, and somewhat similarly a section 18 is separated from the section 14 by a line 20 of perforations. The sections 14 and 18 are of similar size while the section 12 is somewhat larger and incorporates a cord 22 for direct attachment to a unit of merchandise. The verification tag 10 carries several different items of specific information. Indicia 24 on the tag indicates a trade identity for the product. Normally, such indicia will be in a form readily perceivable to a prospective purchaser of the product. Immediately below the indicia 24 on the section 12, there is machine readable printing 26 in the form of a numerical representation, part of which is a batch set designation, another part stating the specific identification of the tag. The number, e.g. 32 746128 serves as a unique address identification for use to designate a storage location or cell in memory described below where information is stored relevant to the product associated with the verification tag 10. Specifically with regard to the exemplary tag 10, the printing 26 manifests a numeral 32 which designates the product to be one unit in a particular batch set. Additionally, the printing designates a numeral 746128 which, within the batch set, identifies a specific unit of merchandise. Below the printing 26 another row of numerals is provided by indicia 28 which is characteristic identification and relates to the verification of the tag 10. Indicia 28 specifies a characteristic identification of the tag 10, i.e. the transparency of the tag 10 at select spots in a specific area within a box 30. That is, the box 30 defines a fragment of section 12 of the tag 10, specific spot locations which have a characteristic, e.g. light transparency, which is specified directly or indirectly by the indicia 28. The detailed operations of sensing the medium of the tag 10 within the box 30 to specify the unique characteristic, then comparing the observed data with the data represented by the indicia 28 is treated in considerable detail in the above identified WO 82 00062. Along the bottom of the verification tag 10 below the box 30 there is size indicia 32 34W 32L for the product and an identification indicia 34. The size indicia 32 indicates the size of the product, e.g. trousers, to which the verification tag will be attached and the identification indicia 34 indicates the so called SKU data for the product stock keeping unit as widely used in the retail industry. Considering the tag sections 14 and 18, each section carries indicia similar to the machine readable printing 26. Specifically, section 14 carries machine readable printing 36 and section 18 carries machine readable printing 38. In general it has been found to be desirable to provide the printings 26, 36, and 38 in horizontal alignment on the tag 10 for standardization in batch processing. To consider the use of the tag 10 somewhat preliminarily, assume that it is to be used on a pair of trousers of a specific size and style. That is, the tag 10 is produced for the specific unit of merchandise to which it is to be attached. In a sense, the tag 10 might be analogized to a birth certificate for a specific unit of merchandise. In the exemplary system, the tag 10 is attached to its associated unit of merchandise by the cord 22. On completion of the unit of merchandise not shown with the tag 10 attached, section 18 of the tag might be removed and processed as part of a set to record the fact that the unit of merchandise exists in a finished form with tag affixed. During normal distribution and marketing operations, the tag 10 will move with its associated unit of merchandise into various channels of commerce. For example, in due course, the unit of merchandise might be placed in inventory for a time, shipped to a distribution point, and then transported to a retail establishment. As a part of such operations, the tag may be sensed at different junctures. At one stage, section 14 may be removed for bulk processing as to record the fact that the unit of merchandise has been sold to a particular retail establishment. Accordingly, groups of the tags provide input data on the basis of the machine readable printing concerning the history status and location of their associated individual units of merchandise. Set data is accordingly developed for convenient future selection of subsets of interest or concern. To provide information on products at terminal or junction points along the commercial path to a consumer, the tag is machine read and data is recorded. In that regard, sections 14 and 18 of the tag can be removed for use in bulk processing operations, or a sensor wand as well known in the art can be used to sense the individual identification number and the batch set number printing 26 . As individual product histories are developed, a record becomes available for sensing, as by use of set theory techniques, to detect and identify products that may be of concern and also to trace the history of specific products. For specific product applications, tags in accordance herewith may incorporate varying numbers of removable sections or none whatsoever depending upon the nature of the merchandise and the related channels of commerce. Essentially, the advantage of removable sections is to accommodate high volume machine operations. Alternatively, as indicated, the product verification tag may be sensed or read by use of a hand held wand as well known in the art of optical readers. Devices as the tag 10 in cooperation with the methods and processing system of the present invention afford verification and flow information on individual units of merchandise associated with the tags. In general, the information is afforded by a technique of processing units of merchandise on a batch basis and treating the batch as a numerical set. By testing developed subsets of a batch set, desired data relating to merchandise of concern may be identified, verification being possible with access to the tags in question. It is important to appreciate that the numeral 32 in the machine readable printing 26 identifies the batch of goods which constitutes an arithmetic set that includes the individual unit associated with the verification tag 10. That is, the system of the present invention involves a philosophy of operation in which units of merchandise are identified both individually and in batches or groups as specified sets and subsets to isolate useful data as the units move in the channels of commerce. Significantly, the system is capable of providing information on the products that are of concern, as distinct from the large volume of products that move properly as scheduled. Examples below will illustrate the subset selection operation with respect to certain market occurrences. Assume, for example, that a batch of verification tags are to be provided to a manufacturing facility from a secure source where the tags are stored. There is always some danger that part of the batch will be diverted for use on counterfeit or unauthorized units of merchandise. In spite of the danger, normally in due course, most of the verification tags in the batch would be attached to individual units of merchandise. Treating such individual units as a subset, with the system hereof it is relatively simple to determine which if any of the tags were not attached to units of merchandise. The identification of the unused tags accommodates tracing and search operations. It may be important that the tags be of a non counterfeitable configuration to assure that the data is reliable. Considering another example, assume that some of a batch of goods are pilfered or lost. By using subset tests, the divergent goods may be positively identified. Goods that are diverted from the manufacturer s proper channels of distribution can also be identified. Additionally, any diverted units of merchandise located outside proper distribution channels may be verified and the source of such units determined. A system of the present invention utilizing the verification tag 10 is illustrated generally in FIGURE 2. The system includes a central processor 40 with a plurality of terminals, some of which are at locations that are remote from the location of the processor and memory 40. A secure terminal 42 for management use may be conveniently located with respect to the central processor and memory 40. Generally, the terminal 42 can command all available operations by the processor 40. The other terminals in the system do not offer such unlimited access or control. Specifically, a limited function terminal 44 is located at a manufacturing site, a similar terminal 46 is located at a warehouse site, and another such terminal 48 is located at a distribution center. Of course, in different embodiments of the present invention, the terminals may be variously located and disposed, depending upon the channels of commerce and the specific goods on which the tags are to be used. In view of the above explanation and description, an understanding of the system of FIGURE 2 may now best be accomplished by assuming a specific merchandising situation and explaining operations by the system of FIGURE 2 utilizing the tag 10 FIGURE 1 as associated goods move through channels of commerce. Accordingly, assume initially that at the location of the management terminal 42, a batch of tags exemplified by the tag 10, FIGURE 1 are prepared for use with a batch of goods, specifically trousers. Tags 10, defining a batch set 32 of identification numbers are sensed and prepared for subsequent verification as described in detail in WO 82 00062. Generally, the characteristic of each tag is sensed at select spots within the box 30. The resulting numerical values are encoded according to a format that may be specified for the batch. The resulting encoded values e.g. 634721 are then printed on the tags along with the other indicia including the machine readable printing 26. Either as an independent operation or concurrently with the coding of the tags, the signal represented data from each tag is registered in the central processor and memory 40 through a communication channel 51. Specifically, the identification numbers e.g. 32 746128 , the SKU numbers e.g. 47318 , and the present state of the tags being sent unattached to a specific manufacturing location are registered as disclosed in detail below to initiate a historical record of each unit of merchandise associated with each tag. Following the initial preparation and recording operations, the tags are transported as a batch to a specific manufacturing site, in the disclosed embodiment the site of the terminal 44. Note that the movement of the tags from the location of the management terminal 42 to the location of the manufacture terminal 44 is indicated by a dashed line 50. The manufacture terminal 44 essentially has the capability to record the next step for commercial production in the processor and memory 40. Specifically, when the assumed batch of tags exemplified by tag 10, FIGURE 1 have been attached individually to units of finished merchandise, e.g. trousers, that occurrence is recorded. The actual recording is performed when section 18 FIGURE 1 of the attached tags are removed and physically supplied to the terminal 44. The terminal processes the tag sections, e.g. section 18, to produce signals representative of the machine readable printing which indicate the batch set number 32 and the unit identification number, for example 746128 . The signals representative of the information are transmitted via the channel 52 to the central processor and memory 40. The records of each unit in the batch set are thus updated by a status change to indicate that the tags are attached to units of merchandise. The terminal 44 also may be actuated to indicate the shipment of specific items of merchandise to specific warehouses for recording in the cells of memory 40. Considering the specific operations, the information developed at the terminal 44 by machine reading the sections 18 and by supplemental input as a keyboard data is supplied to the central processor 40 through a communication path 52 and the record on the exemplary batch set is enhanced. The batch set may now comprise a plurality of separate subsets. For example, less than all of the batch of the tags might have been attached to units of merchandise. Also, the tags of a batch set may be on goods that are shipped to different warehouses. In any event, the central processor 40 FIGURE 2 registers such facts to distinguish subsets of the batch set. Units of merchandise shipped from the location of the terminal 44 to the warehouse location of the terminal 46 is indicated by the dashed line 54. As suggested, other destinations might also be involved however, at the terminal 46, an operation similar to that described above occurs when the units of merchandise are again moved as indicated by the dashed line 56. Specifically, the set may be further divided, the data on individual units reflecting such divisions being transmitted by the terminal 46 through the channel 58 to be recorded in individual cells or the equivalent by the processor and memory 40. The original batch set may be further divided at the distribution terminal 48 where appropriate data is transmitted by the terminal 48 through the channel 60 to the memory 40. The related movement of the units of merchandise is indicated by the dashed lines 61, an event which is also recorded in the memory 40. With each significant movement of the units of merchandise, the machine readable numerical designation is sensed to provide input signals to the central processor and memory 40 which enables tracing of individual units of merchandise based on numerical set analysis. In using the label tag 10 to reduce data to signals, tag sections 14 and 18 may be removed for batch processing by an optical code reader. Consequently, the sections can be transported to a terminal location for access to the central processor 40. Using an alternative approach, as indicated above, the machine readable numerical designations on the tag 10 may be sensed by a hand held wand with the tags in place, attached to individual units of merchandise. As the units of merchandise flow into channels of commerce, the management secure terminal 42 may be employed to test the contents of the central processor 40 and associated memory to indicate that either tags or merchandise have gone astray. It is important to appreciate that the machine readable numerical designations indicate a designated batch and an individual item. By utilization of the combination information with the ability to define subsets, the system is effective for providing detailed information for tracing goods, particularly goods that have gone astray. A variety of arithmetic set operations are described below with reference to the more detailed system representation of FIGURE 3, for identifying units of merchandise that have moved out of proper marketing channels. History information on select units of merchandise is also available. For example, the distribution terminal 48 may provide an identification number to the processor and memory 40 for a rundown on a specific unit of merchandise. FIGURE 3 illustrates the system of FIGURE 2 in somewhat greater detail and will now be described with regard to detailed operations. However, in FIGURE 3 only two terminals are represented, i.e. a location terminal 62 representative of remote terminals, e.g. terminals 44, 46, and 48, and a management terminal 64. The remote location terminal 62 typifies a possible variety of such terminals while the management terminal 64 represents a comprehensive computer interface in relation to the central processor. The terminals 62 and 64 are connected to a terminal controller 66 which is in turn connected to a central processor controller 68 that is associated with an address register 70 and a memory 72. The memory 72 is organized to register a large number of information items each being associated with a particular item of merchandise. Considering the exemplary tag 10 FIGURE 1 a cell in the memory 72 is provided for information on the tag 10 where data may take a format as represented in FIGURE 4. Of course, a wide variety of different data registration techniques and schemes may be employed as well as a multitude of addressing and search techniques. However, in essence, the memory 72 FIGURE 3 registers information on units of merchandise designated individually and in batch sets with information indicative of the history of such units of merchandise. In the described embodiment, individual data locations are specified by the identification number, e.g. 32 746128 which can form an address for the memory 72 either for all units in a batch or for any individual unit. That is, the identification number is in a one to one arithmetic correspondence with the machine address. Of course, a wide variety of addressing and search schemes are presently in use and can be variously implemented. Likely, additional schemes will evolve in the future. The important consideration resides in the fact that the identification number printing 26 associated with the tag 10 FIGURE 1 may be specified to the memory 72 FIGURE 3 to place a value in the address register 70 which will access the memory 72 a data cell or a group of cells as illustrated in FIGURE 4. As illustrated in FIGURE 4, an initial data section 80 of the memory cell contains representations of the identification batch number 32 and unit number 746128 which is the machine readable printing 26 FIGURE 1 . Note that this data is a repetition, in that the identification confirms the address. The next section 86 of the memory cell FIGURE 4 contains the SKU number, e.g. 47316 , providing further identification data. The following section 88 registers a number manifesting the last reported status or state of the associated unit of merchandise. Of course, a number of states may be assigned however, examples simply include possible situations for units of merchandise associated with the tag 10. In the illustrative embodiment, the following state codes are applicable Somewhat associated with the state of an item of merchandise are the location codes registered in sequence as a history for the movements of each unit of merchandise. A code in section 90 contains information indicating the time and manufacture location of the associated merchandise. For example, the numerals 3648 are coded to indicate the year, month, and a specific factory. The next illustrated sections in the sequence record various data specific to individual units of merchandise. In that regard the batch set may be divided further into subsets. Section 92 records the identification of a warehouse, section 94 indicates a date of sale and a customer. Following the historical record sections, e.g. sections 90, 92, and 94, a section 95 records the characteristic verification number for the tag 10. That designation can confirm the authenticity of a tag associated with a unit of merchandise. Note that the memory sections 80, 86, 88, 90, and 95 are loaded at the time when the tag 10 is initially processed. Thereafter, the history sections receive other data to record the movements of the associated unit of merchandise and formulate subset criteria for tracing and auditing operations. For example, the number 72 indicates a specific warehouse while the number 4105793 indicates a sales date and a specific retail organization. The central processor 68 FIGURE 3 in the system for controlling operations may comprise any of a variety of machine processors capable of controlling the flow of data with respect to the memory 72 and performing certain logic operations. The logic operations for the controller 68 may vary considerably however, exemplary operations are set forth below In general with respect to the logic operations, the tests of routine checking will involve identifying a specific number or a subset of identification numbers associated with merchandise that has become of interest or should be of interest. For example, a test for tags of a specific batch set that have not been attached to merchandise may identify verification tags that have gone astray and may well be expected to appear on counterfeit merchandise. Other tests for identifying other problematic merchandise identifications will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art of marketing and distribution. In view of the above description of an illustrative embodiment of the system, further details and the operation thereof may now be best understood by considering an exemplary merchandising operation concurrently with the introduction of other system components. Accordingly, assume initially the need for a batch of tags as exemplified by the tag 10 FIGURE 1 . The tags might be partially completed in a raw form as a result of bulk operations that would include cutting the tags and printing the record data, i.e. the indicia 24 trade identification , machine readable printing 26 identification number , the box 30, the size indicia 32, and the SKU indicia 34. Completion of the tags involves characteristic verification coding to formulate signals representative of a characteristic of each individual tag and to print the representative indicia 28. Specifically, the raw tags would be completed at the management terminal 64. The processing includes a number of specific operations with the terminal 64 coupled through an interface unit 95 to the central processor 68 via the terminal controller 66. Such operations are to be performed in a high speed batch process, however, consider the events with respect to a single tag. Control is provided by an input device 100 and monitoring data is provided by an output device 101. The input and output devices 100 and 101 are coupled to the interface unit 95 as well as a sensor 96, a printer 98, and a reader 102. A label reader 102 reads the machine readable printing 26 from the tag. The sensed tag I.D. number may be printed on a list by the output device 101 if hard copy is desired. The output device may include a display as well as a printer. Somewhat concurrently with the operation of the reader 102 sensing the identification number printing 26 the verification sensor 96 senses the light transparency of the tag 10 at pre programmed locations in the box 30 FIGURE 1 . The resulting signals FIGURE 3 drive the printer 98 through the interface unit 95 to accomplish the characteristic verification indicia 28. Signals representative of the identification number are sent to the central processor and controller 68 for registration. Upon receiving signals representative of the identification number the machine readable printing 26 the central processor controller 68 accesses a cell in the memory 72 specified by the identification number 32 746128 using the address register 70. The same identification number 32 746128 is then registered in the designated section or cell of the memory, see FIGURE 4. The input device 100 is used to set up the central processor and controller 68 to provide signals for registering additional data in the addressed cell of the memory 72. Specifically, signals representative of the SKU number 47316 , the initial state of the tag 1 , and the initial destination of the tag 3648 , indicating a date and specific manufacturing location are provided from operating memory to be registered in the addressed cell along with the verification data 634721 . Detailed structures and methods for sensing the verification data are disclosed in the referenced parent patent application Non Counterfeitable Document System . That is, the representative verification signals are supplied to the printer 98 which prints the individual indicia 28 on each tag, e.g. tag 10. Also, the sensed data is supplied from the verification sensor through the interface unit 95 and the terminal controller for registration in section 95 FIGURE 4 of the specified cell in memory 72, e.g. as the number 634721 . Thus, tags, e.g. tag 10, are prepared, complete with initial records, as a group which constitutes a batch designated as batch 32 , however, each unit being individually identifiable. The act of transmitting the exemplary batch of tags to a manufacturing facility may serve as authority for the production of units of merchandise specified by the tags. Alternatively, various confirmatory or authorization techniques might be employed to order production of merchandise units for the individual tags. With each of the tags transferred to a manufacturing location on a specific month combination designation 3648 the history or life of a group of individual products is initiated. Soon after production, or even as a step in the production of specific units of merchandise, individual tags, as exemplified by tag 10, are attached to each unit of associated merchandise. Specifically, the tag 10 is attached to a pair of trousers, size 34L 32W , SKU number 47318 . That unit of merchandise accordingly can be confirmed as a genuine article by the affixed verifiable tag 10. Furthermore, in accordance herewith that unit can be identified for tracing or auditing operations. Continuing with the exemplary sequence of events, assume that the goods are next prepared to be shipped to a warehouse. As a part of that procedure, sections e.g. section 18 FIGURE 1 are removed from the tags affixed to merchandise for bulk processing at a terminal, e.g. the terminal 62, FIGURE 3. The tag sections, exemplified by the section 18 are fed to a bulk label reader 106 which senses the machine readable printing in the form of the identification number 32 746128 . Prior to communicating the identification numbers to the controller 68, a keyboard 108 is actuated to establish communication through an interface unit 109 and the terminal controller 66 to the controller 68. The keyboard is actuated to instruct the controller 68 to register additional information on each of the identified units. Specifically, the status code is changed from 1 designating unattached tags to 2 designating attached tags. Furthermore, the warehouse destination for the goods is indicated to be recorded in section 92 FIGURE 4 . Accordingly, after the preliminary communication steps between the terminal 62 and the central processor controller 68, a group of tags, as tag 10, are batch processed to provide signals representative of the machine readable printing 26 tag 10, FIGURE 1 . Those signals serve to address cells in the memory 72 FIGURE 3 which are accessed to alter the registered state section 88 FIGURE 4 and supplement the historical record of the merchandise register warehouse 72 in section 92 . It should be recognized that the batch of designated units may be sent to different warehouses. That fact will be registered by the coded designations of the different warehouses and registered in section 92 of the memory cell. In that regard, subsets of the batch set are defined. Continuing with the assumed example, as indicated above, the goods or merchandise may be shipped from the warehouse e.g. the warehouse designated 72 FIGURE 4 to a variety of different distribution terminals. On that occasion, the identification numbers may be sensed by using a hand held wand in association with a reader, as the reader 106, to scan the machine readable printing 26 FIGURE 1 . The sensed information I.D. numbers may then be used to locate data cells in the memory 72 FIGURE 3 for the recording of additional information. Specifically, distribution centers may be recorded for each item of merchandise. Tracing a pattern of movement for the goods, in due course they will be shipped to a retailer. At that stage, title to the merchandise will likely pass with the consequence that another status change is appropriate. The date is significant along with the identification of the recipient or recipients of the merchandise. Accordingly, using the terminal in the proximity of the distribution location exemplified again as the terminal 62 , the appropriate instructions are issued and data from the tags is batch processed. Thus, as described above, cells in the memory 72 are revised and updated. Status 3 may be entered in memory sections 88 to indicate the merchandise has been sold and the date recipient and date code 4105793 may be entered in the section 94. As the historical record is developed, a basis is provided for tracing the merchandise and testing for merchandise or tags that may strayed from the proper channels of commerce. Many tests using set classifications to isolate problem situations will be apparent to persons with marketing expertise. However, some exemplary tests will now be explained, as facilitated at the management terminal 64, using the input device 100 and the output device 101. At a time when most tags in a batch should have been attached to goods, a simple test for a subset of tags in the batch which have not been attached to units of merchandise is informative. A test for all tags of batch 32 that are still in state code 1 would identify a subset of specific tags that may suggest a problem. Accordingly, further investigation likely would be appropriate, as the identified tags may have been lost or stolen. If appropriate, the specific identification numbers of such labels can be listed as possible counterfeit merchandise or other action can be taken. Set tests for identifying tags of merchandise also can be important to locate lost or stolen merchandise. For example, a test of operation code 4 could identify any specific units of merchandise of the batch set 32 that had not been sold as indicated by state code 3 . After all units in a batch normally would have been expected to have been sold, the test for any remaining units could be informative as to stolen merchandise. Another test to indicate goods of interest might be used in the event that a purchaser claimed a short delivery. Specifically, according to an operation code 7 a search could be made to identify the subset of units sold to the purchaser after a specific time. Such a list would enable an inventory check with the objective of identifying missing goods as stolen. The verifiable identification numbers of such missing goods would provide a meaningful basis for checking into the situation. In the event that stolen or diverted goods are found, the individual units of merchandise can be traced from the history recorded in the memory 72. For example, a unit of stolen merchandise can be tested at the terminal 64. The label reader 102 senses the identification number of the unit and the verification sensor 96 senses the inherent characteristic for verifying that the tag is genuine. The input device 100 is used to command an inquiry and as a consequence, the identified cell in the memory 72 provides signals to the output device 101 to manifest the cell contents as illustrated in FIGURE 4. Consequently, the history of the merchandise unit is provided affording data to determine the last location and status of the unit before going astray. With such information further investigation may well determine the source of a problem that can be corrected. Persons skilled in specific marketing operations will promptly recognize that by the performance of various set logic tests involving relationships between recorded status data, location information, identification numbers, and batches, considerable information may be obtained at various stages on isolated units of merchandise to combat common problems in that regard. As another example, one might check units of a set that were reportedly sent to a particular group of warehouses or customers. Culpable parties in a chain of transactions may be identified. As suggested above, tags may take various forms. An alternative structural tag form is illustrated in FIGURES 5 and 6. Specifically, a merchandise container or box 126 is provided with a releasable tag overlay 128 on a folded panel 130 of the box 126. The overlay 128 comprises a natural fiber material, specifically paper. Considering the structure in greater detail, the tag overlay 128 is provided with artwork including trade identification printing 132, a characteristic locating rectangle 134, and identification number indicia 136 which is in machine readable form. A return instruction 137 is also provided on the overlay 128, specifically Return this card to verify your purchase . The overlay 128 coincides to the panel 130 in area, folds, and major artwork. Including folded sections in the overlay 128 can make it more difficult to remove the overlay without leaving traces of such removal. The overlay 128 is releasably bonded to the panel 130 by a layer 138 of adhesive as illustrated in FIGURE 6. The layer 138 is releasable with respect to the clean removal of the overlay 128. Normally, such removal will involve opening a flap of the mated overlay 128 and panel 130 to the illustrated position of FIGURE 5. The overlay 128 can then be easily removed as illustrated at the upper right corner, with the adhesive layer 138 remaining on the panel 130. Note that the panel 130 has artwork similar to that of the overlay 128, as shown by printing 132a. Once removed from the box 126, the tag overlay 128 is in the form of a flat sheet and can be batch processed as one of a large group. In some situations it may be desirable to use an area of the overlay 128 for the characteristic verification data, while in other situations it may be desirable to use an area of the box 126. Individual situations will resolve such details. In that regard, in addition to specifying subsets on the basis of select batch identification or historical data, it is important to afford operations that can verify the authenticity of individual devices in the form of labels, boxes, or packages. That is, if the identification devices are susceptible to easy counterfeiting, then the operations as described above with respect to monitoring may be cast in doubt as far as reliability is concerned. The invitation legend or instruction 137 is effective to verify authenticity, and is particularly useful in conjunction with units of merchandise that are frequently counterfeited. Frequently, a purchaser may suspect that merchandise purchased is not genuine in view of the circumstances of the sale. In such a situation, the purchaser may very well return part or all of the overlay 128, if only to satisfy curiosity. Testing the authenticity of such returned overlays in the present system can be very informative. If the overlay is not genuine, a counterfeit is known and corrective steps can be pursued. If the overlay is authentic, the history of the product may be in relation to other possibilities as considered above. From the above detailed description it may be seen that the system of the present invention affords an effective means for combatting counterfeit operations as well as other techniques involving the diversion or substitution of trade identified merchandise.
