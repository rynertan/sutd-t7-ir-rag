# Control word source for time division switching system accomodating multirate data.

## Abstract
A time division switching system for switching data words from data word sources received in channels of a ti me multiplex line where a first plurality of data word sour ces uses a channel only once every n channels and a se cond plurality of data word sources uses a channel once every m channels where m is less than n and n is not an integer multiple of m. The switching system operates in re sponse to control words sequentially provided by a control word source. The control word source of the disclosed em bodiment comprises a first storage arrangement having n storage locations for storing control words and a second storage arrangement having m storage locations for storing control words. A storage reading circuit substantially simul taneously reads the contents of one storage location of both storage arrangements sequentially. A selection arran gement receives the control words from the storage read ing circuit and transmits a predetermined one of the two control words se read to the time division switching system for control thereof.
