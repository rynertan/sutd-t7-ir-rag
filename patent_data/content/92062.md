# Voltage balancing circuit for memory systems.

## Abstract
A voltage balancing circuit, particularly suitable for bipolar memory arrays producing small signals, is provided which includes first and second conductive lines BL0, BL1 , a point of reference potential VR , a first device 16 dis posed between the first conductive line BL0 and the point of reference potential VR , a second device 18 disposed between the second conductive line BL1 and the point of reference potential VR , first and second transistors 16, 18 , first means for coupling the first line through the first transistor to the second line, second means for coupling the second line through the second transistor to the first line, and means 22, R1, R2 for supplying substantially equal signals to the control electrodes of the first and second transistors.
