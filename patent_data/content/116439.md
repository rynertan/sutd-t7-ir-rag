## Description
FATTY ACID CONTAINING HAIR TONIC COMPOSITION The present invention relates to.a novel hair tonic composition suitable for use in preventing the generation of dandruff or scurf in hair and itching in the scalp and in accelerating the growth of hair. More specifically, it relates to a novel hair tonic composition containing, as an effective ingredient, at least one fatty acid and or the cosmetically acceptable salts thereof. The possession of a healthy and profuse head of hair throughout the life is the ambition of most human beings. Various kinds of hair dressings, including hair tonic compositions, have been used for alleviating or curing epilation or depilation i.e., the involuntary loss of hair and subsequent balding .However, although various kinds of disease appear, such as alopecia, the causes thereof and the mechanisms thereof are not fully understood. Accordingly, at present, there are,no truly effective agents for alleviating the epilation , accelerating the growth of hair, and further alleviating or curing the generation of dandruff in the hair and itching in the scalp. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a novel hair tonic composition capable of effectively depressing the generation of dandruff and itching in the hair and scalp and also of exhibiting a remarkable and real acceleration of the growth of hair. Other objects and advantages of the present inven tionwill be apparent from the description set forth hereinbelow. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a hair tonic composition containing, as an effective ingredient, at least one compound selected from the group consisting of linoleic acid, oleic acid, arachidonic acid, linolenic acid, parinaric acid, petroselinic acid, palmitoleic acid, n capric acid, n caprylic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid and palmitic acid and the cosmetically acceptable salts thereof. The inventors have previously found that, after making a detailed comparative study of the microflora of the scalps of persons with healthy hair and those of persons with unhealthy hair e.g., the generation of dandruff and itching in the scalp and abnormal depilation , Staphylococcus caitis constitutes all or most parts of the microflora in the scalp of those with healthy hair, and that, when the cells of Staphylococcus capitis or the treated products thereof are applied to the scalp, the remarkable growth effect of hair can be obtained. Furthermore, the inventors have clarified that the cells of Staphvlococcus capitis have a lipase activity and testosterone Sa reductase i.e., 5a reductase inhibitory activity.The term 5a reductase denotes an enzyme which reduces testosterone to 5a dihydrotestosterone. Based on these findings, the inventors have suggested that the abovementioned activities are closely correlated with the growth effect of hair see U.S. Patent ApplicationNo. 505,273 or European Patent ApplicationNo. 83303654.4 . The inventors have also found that, when the correlation of the above mentioned lipase activity and 5 reductase inhibitory activity with the hair growth effect is studied in detail, products containing fatty acids, as a main constituent, obtained from the interaction of lipase from Staphylococcus capitis with fats and oils, have a strong Sa reductase inhibitory activity. The inventors have surprisingly found that, after making a detailed study of the active component in the above mentioned fatty acids, linoleic acid, oleic acid, arachidonic acid, linolenic acid, parinaric acid, petroselinic acid, palmitoleic acid, n capric acid, n caprylic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid or palmitic acid or the salts thereof have a strong 5 reductase inhibitory activity and the fatty acids per se have an effective action on the growth of hair. As a result, the present invention has been completed. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Kokai No. 56 61308 discloses a hair treatment composition for alleviating the generation of dandruff in the hair and itching in the scalp. This composition contains zinc pyrithione and certain carboxylic acid compounds.However, there is no description relating to the fatty acids of the present invention in this publication.Furthermore, this publication only discloses that the specified carboxylic acid compounds have a very gentle or moderate action to the human bodies and cause no pathogenic irritation against the eyes and the skins.Neither the Sa reductase inhibitory activity of the fatty acids nor the hair growth acceleration effect thereof is taught in this publication. Japanese National Publication of InternationalApplication Kohyo 57 502166 discioses a hair treatment containing betaine and certain aliphatic organic acids.However, there is no description relating to the fatty acids of the present invention in this publication.Furthermore, this publication only discloses that this hair treatment is effective for affording a good brushing property to the hair without causing any physical damages on the hair. There is no description relating to the growth effect of hair in this publication at all. The active ingredients used in the hair tonic composition of the present invention are linoleic or linolic acid, oleic acid, arachidonic acid, linolenic acid, parinaric acid, petroselinic acid, palmitoleic acid, n capric acid, n caprylic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid and palmitic acid per se and the cosmetically acceptable various salts thereof. Examples of the cosmetically acceptable salts are inorganic salts such as an ammonium salt, alkali metal salts e.g., lithium salt, potassium salt, sodium salt , alkaline earth metal salts e.g., magnesium salt , and an aluminum salt. These active ingredients can be used alone or in any mixture thereof. The amounts of the active ingredients incorporated into the hair tonic compositions according to the present invention are not particularly limited to the specified range, since the active ingredients have no pathogenic activity to human bodies. Thus, although the amount of the active ingredient incorporated into the hair tonic composition can be varied in a wide range, the preferable amount is 0.01 to 10 by weight, based on the total amount of the hair tonic composition. When two or more ingredients are used, the total amount thereof is preferably 0.01 to 10 by weight based on the total amount of the hair tonic composition. When the amount of the active ingredient is less than 0.01 by weight, the desirable growth effect of hair is not fully obtained. Contrary to this, when the amount of the active ingredient is more than 10 by weight, the desireble growth effect of hair is saturated and, and it is used, feeling is unconfortable. The base materials used in the hair tonic compositions according to the present invention can include those conventionally used in any cosmetic compositions.Examples of such base materials which can be used in the present invention are distilled water monohydric alcohols such as ethyl alcohol polyhydric alcohols such as glycerine and ethylene glycol fats and oils surfactants. In addition to the above mentioned active ingredients, various conventional ingredients suitably used in the formulation of a hair tonic composition or a hair dressing composition can be incorporated in a conventional amount into the hair tonic composition of the present invention Typical examples of such ingredients are hormones, vitamins, amino acids, herb extracts, photosensitizing dyes, resorcinoli menthol, wetting agents, and perfumes. These ingredients can be optionally incorporated into the hair tonic composition of the presentinvention unless the desired effect of the present invention is impaired.Especially, since unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid, parinaric acid, palmitoleic acid, petroselinic acid, arachidone acid, and oleic acid are susceptible to oxidation, an antioxidant such as tocopherol can be preferably incorporated into the present hair tonic composition in an amount of, for example, one to one tenth time. of the fatty acid. The final forms of the hair tonic composition according to the present invention can be any conventional form of hair tonic or hair dressing compositions such as hair tonic, hair lotion, hair cream, shampoo, linse, hair liquid, hair oil, pomade, and hair stick.Other forms can also be utilized. The hair growth effect of the active ingredients used in the present invention is not clearly understood, but an attempted explanation is given hereinbelow without prejudice to the present invention. Various theories have been proposed relating to the causes of depilation, epilation, dandruff, and itching.For example, an unbalanced hormone constitution theory, a nutrient relating theory, a seborrhea theory, and a genetic. or hereditary theory are known and it appears that there is a high correlation between the above mentioned abnormal conditions and the. development of sebaceous gland see Masumi Inaba, Mainichi Life November, 1981, pages 26 to 35 Saishin Keshohin Kagaku Recent Cosmetics Science , pages 130 published byYakuji Nippo Sha in 1980 Kenji Adachi et. al., Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communication, 41 4 , pages 884 to 890 1970 Susumu Takayasu et. al.,Journal of Investigative Dermatology 74, pages 187 to 191, 1980 . That is, when the sebaceous gland of the scalp is developed by nutrients, hormones or the like, the amount of 5 reductase in the sebaceous gland increases. The level of Sa dihydrotestosterone, more active androgen, becomes high. This tissue active androgen is transferred to hair papilla via blood vessels, thereby alleviating the activities of adenylcyclase in hair matrix cells.As a result, it is believed that the size of hair follicles is gradually reduced, therefore, the hair becomes thin and downy. Years cf repetition of these processes cause baldness. Based on these mechanisms for generating depilation and epilation, the 5a reductase activity is an important characteristic and property, which the hair tonic composition should have, and also become a standard or criterion for scientifically evaluating the effect of the hair tonic or hair dressing compositions. As mentioned above, the fatty acids and the salts thereof used in the present invention have a strong Sa reductase inhibitory activity and the strong hair growth effect of the present hair tonic composition is believed to be caused by the above mentioned mechanism due to the Sa reductase inhibitory activity. Furthermore, the microflora of the scalp is maintained in or brought to a healthy state by the fatty acids and the salts thereof contained in the hair tonic composition according to the present invention. It is considered that when these actions or functions are combined or multiplied they exhibit a strong hair growth acceleration effect. The hair tonic composition according to the present invention has the Sa reductase inhibitory activity as mentioned above, and when the hair tonic composition according to the present invention is applied to the human scalp or animal skins, strong hair growth acceleration effects can be provided. That is, when the hair tonic composition according to the present invention is applied to the human scalp, the depilation and epilation can be effectively alleviated, downy hairs become healthy, and the generation of dandruff and itching can be prevented. Furthermore, when the hair tonic composition of the present invention is applied to animals, the growth velocity of the hair fur remarkably increases. The nonpathogenicity of the hair tonic composition according to the present invention has been confirmed.That is, the fatty acids of the present invention and the salts thereof were independently dispersed in an ethanol, and the mixtures were spread on the skins of five rabbits once a day for 3 davs in each mixture. The ethanol was also spread in the same manner as a control.As a result, no abnormal cdndition was found in each case. The Sa reductase inhibitory activity was determined as follows. Prostate gland cells of rats were crushed and a specimen of testosterone Sa reductase was then prepared by separating microsome from the crushed liquid mixture.The conversion of the testosterone to Sa dihydro testosterone by the use of the above prepared enzyme specimen was monitored by radioisotopically labelled testosterone. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate and the extract was developed twice by silica gel thin layer chromatography solvent system, dichloromethane cyclohexane acetone 15 4 1 . The amount of Sa dihydrotestosterone were determined from the intensities of the radioactivity. Reaction A 30 p1 amount of a 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 6.6 , 10 p1 of an enzyme specimen, 8.5 pmol of labelled testosterone, 50 nmol of a reduced form of NADP nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate , and 10 ijl of a test sample were mixed final volume 50 it . The mixture was included at a temperature of 250C for 60 minutes. The reaction was stopped by the addition cf 100 ul of ethyl acetate, and the reaction mixture was extracted by vigorous shaking. The extract was developed in the same manner as mentioned above and the intensity of the radioisotope was measured by using a scintillation counter. The above mentioned determination was applied to the samples having various concentrations. The 5a reductase inhibitory activity was obtained as a ir,hibi tory rate 8 or a 50 inhibitory concentration IC50 . The Sa reductase inhibitiory activitv IC of the 50 fatty acids of the present invention are as follows Fatty Acid IC50 mM Linoleic acid 0.18 Olic acid 0.32 Arachidonic acid 0.15 Linolenic acid 1.6 Parinaric acid 1.1 Petroselinic acid 0.28 Palmitoleic acid 0.18 n Capric acid 0.5 n Caprylic acid 1.7 Lauric acid 0.6 Myristic acid 1.8 Palmitic acid 0.3 EXAMPLES The present invention will now be further illustrated by, but is by ne means limited to, the following examples, in which the preparation, application, and effect of the hair tonic composition of the present invention are specifically disclosed.
