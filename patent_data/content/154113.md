# Modular head assembly for a pressure vessel of a nuclear reactor.

## Abstract
A modular head assembly 110 for a nuclear reactor pressure vessel includes a closure head 112 having control rod drive mechanisms 116 mounted thereon with cooling air baffles 118 providing air paths for cooling air for the CRDMs 116 , and a lower air manifold 120 fluidically connected to the cooling baffles 118 as well as to vertically upwardly extending air ducts and manifolds 136, 138, 140 and axial flow exhaust fans 126 fluidically connected to the ducts 140 through means of plenum chambers 162 , all being disposed within the peripheral outline of the closure head 112 and being removable together wih the closure head 112 .
