## Description
i ol,ylveptiaes naving Interferon Activity Interferons are proteins which are synthesized by cells in response to viral infection, immune stimulation and a variety of inducers and which are presently divided into three major classes alpha or leukocyte interferon IFN , beta or fibroblast interferon IFN ss and gamma or immune interferon IFN y . The interferons have antiviral and antiproliferative activities, a potent ability to confer a virus resistant state in targeted cells and immunomodulatory activities J.L. Toy, Clin. exp. Immunol. 54, 1 13 1983 . Their biological properties have led to the clinical use of interferons as therapeutic agents for the treatment of viral infections and malignancies. Interferons have been obtained from natural sources such as leukocytes derived from the buffy coats of whole blood, lympoblastoid cells in continuous suspension culture or fibroblast cultures upon stimulation with inducing agents. Cells which can be stimulated to produce IFN y include both B and T cells. The interferons obtained from these sources have been purified to homogeneity. Interferons have also been produced using methods of recombinantDNA technology. i.e. by expression from microorganisms transformed with expression vectors containing interferon genes under the control of suitable promoter operator sequences. The leukocyte, fibroblast and immune interferons produced by recombinant techniques are designated rIFN a. rIFN ss and rIFN y, respectively. Since at least 12 distinct IFN a genes have been identified the corresponding proteins are designated rIFN oA, rIFN aB, rIFN aC and so forth. The amino acid sequences of rIFN aA L, as well as the nucleotide sequences which encode them are described, e.g.. by Pestka in Archiv. Biochem. Biophys. 221, 1 1983 and in British Patent Specification No. 2 079 291. Goeddel and coworkers achieved the initial expression of rIFN ak in E. coli cells transformed with the recombinant plasmid pL 31 Nature, 287, 411 416 1980 . This plasmid contains the structural gene for mature rIFN aA i.e., a gene in which the nucleotide sequence encoding a 23 amino acid signal peptide normally translated in the human cell has been removed and an ATG start signal has been inserted immediately before the codon for the first amino acid following the signal peptide under the control of an appropriately positioned promoter operator sequence.The rIFN a interferons are 165 amino acids in the case of rIFN aA or 166 amino acids in length, except that they may, in some instances contain an additional methionine attached to the N terminus of the ordinarily first amino acid of the protein as the result of translation of the ATG start signal which encodes methionine. Hybrid leukocyte interferons have been produced by expression of genes which are produced by cleaving two or more IFN genes at internal endonuclease cleavage sites and then ligating one or more fragments of one gene with one or more fragments of a different gene or genes to produce a new gene encoding a complete 165 or 166 amino acid IFN a with specific segments corresponding to portions of different IFN species.In this manner, for example, it has been possible to produce a leukocyte interferon in which the amino acid sequence corresponds to amino acids 1 91 of rIFN oA followed by amino acids 92 166 of rIFN oD. Similarly, it has been possible to produce a hybrid IFN a in which the amino acid sequence corresponds to amino acids 1 92 of rIFN otD followed by amino acids 93 165 of rIFN aA J. Biol. Chem. 257, 11497 11502 1982 . The cloning and expression of mature rIFN ss, its amino acid structure, as well as the nucleotide sequence coding therefor are described by Goeddel et al. in Nucleic AcidsResearch 8, 4057 1980 . The cloning and expression of mature rIFN y, its amino acid structure and the nucleotide sequence coding therefor are described by Gray et al. in Nature 295, 503 1982 . However, allelic variations of the specific amino acid sequences of the above cited interferons are possible and have already been described. For example, Nagata and coworkers described the expression of an rIFN a gene denoted as rIFN l which yielded a polypeptide in non mature form differing from rIFN aD by a single amino acid at position 114 Nature 284, 316 1980 . Similarly the cloning and expression of another rIFN a gene identified as rIFN a2 which yielded a polypeptide differing from rIFN aA by a single amino acid at position 23 has been described in European Patent Application No. 32 134 published July 15, 1981. A problem which has occurred in the manufacture and use of interferons is that the individual interferon molecules tend to oligomerize. While the etiology of these oligomers has not been completely understood it is believed that the methods used to purify interferons for therapeutic use such as high pressure liquid chromatography or monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography may contribute to the formation of dimers, trimers and higher oligomers of interferon.These oligomeric forms which have been observed particularly with respect to leukocyte and fibroblast interferons result from two or more interferon molecules becoming irreversibly associated with one another through intermolecular covalent bondings, such as disulfide linkages. While the dimeric forms of interferons are believed to retain biological activity, the higher oligomeric forms in many cases have either no biological activity or significantly reduced activity by comparison to the monomeric forms. Moreover, the oligomeric forms have the potential for causing deleterious side effects if used therapeutically. All of the known rIFN as, rIFN B and rIFN y contain several cysteine residues the sulfhydryl side chains of which are capable of forming intramolecular and intermolcular disulfide bonds, which latter result in oligomerization. The amino acid sequence of rIFN aA contains cysteine residues at positions 1, 29, 98 and 138. Wetzel assigned intramolecular disulfide bonds between the cysteine residues at positions 1 and 98 and between the cysteine residues at positions 29. and 138 Nature 289, 606 1981 . Heretofore, efforts to overcome the oligomerization problem have concentrated on adjusting the purification conditions in order to prevent the formation of oligomers or on post processing reaction conditions whereby intermolecular disulfide bonds are reduced. The present invention in a first broad aspect relates to novel polypeptides having interferon activity comprising an amino acid sequence corresponding to the amino acid sequence of an interferon selected from a rIFN a, a hybrid rIFN a, rIFN s and rIFN y wherein, however, at least one cysteine residue has been replaced by another amino acid residue, i.e. an amino acid residue which is incapable of forming an intermolecular disulfide bond. In a preferred embodiment of this broad aspect, the invention relates to a polypeptide with the amino acid sequence of rIFN aA in which, however, at least one of the cysteine residues at positions 1 and 98 has been replaced by another amino acid residue which is incapable of forming an intermolecular disulfide bond. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions with antiviral activity containing the novel polypeptides and which are essentially free of oligomers other than dimers and, preferably, contain only a stable monomeric interferon. In a second broad aspect. this invention relates to methods and intermediates for producing the novel polypeptides described above by recombinant DNA technology. In particular. this aspect relates to a method of producing a double stranded DNA dsDNA encoding the novel polypeptides by using restriction enzymes to excise a portion of the dsDNA comprising the codon for the undesired cysteine residue from the parental interferon gene and replacing it with a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide segment wherein the nucleotide triplet coding for cysteine has been replaced by a nucleotide triplet coding for another amino acid residue which is incapable of forming an intermolecular disulfide bond. Accordingly, this second broad aspect of the invention encompasses dsDNA sequences coding for the novel polypeptides, replicable plasmidic expression vehicles containing these dsDNA sequences. microorganisms transformed with these replicable plasmidic expression vehicles and a method of preparing these dsDNA sequences. Preferred polypeptides of the invention are those obtained by substitution of cysteine residues in rIFN as and hybrid rIFN s. All rIFN as and corresponding hybrid rIFN s contain a cysteine residue at the N terminus, i.e. at position 1. Additionally. rIFN aA contains cysteine residues at positions 29, 98 and 138, rIFN aB at positions 29, 100 and 139 rIFN aC, F, G, H, I, J, K andL at positions 29, 99 and 139 and rIFN D at positions 29, 86, 99 and 139. It has to be noted that Pestka, inArchiv. Biochem. Biophys. 221, 1 1983 , Fig. 17, shows cysteine residues at positions 99 and 139 of rIFN cA rather than at positions 98 and 138.This is because the sequence representation has been shifted one position following position 43 to align it with the other rIFN a species which contain one more amino acid residue than rIFN A. All amino acid positions recited herein refer to sequentially numbered amino acids and do not account for such shifts. It is understood that the polypeptides of the invention have amino acid sequences corresponding to amino acid sequences of known rIFNs wherein, however, at least one cysteine residue has been replaced by another amino acid residue which is incapable of forming intermolecular disulfide bonds, The cysteine residues which are replaced are those which are not required to maintain interferon activity of the molecule. As used herein the term interferon activity refers to antiviral and antigrowth activity characteristic of the interferons. The characteristic antiviral activity of rIFN can be determined using the cytopathic effect inhibition test described by Familletti et al.in Methods in Enzymology 78, 387 1981 . The characteristic antigrowth activity of rIFN can be determined using the procedure described by Evinger, M. Pestka. S., Methods inEnzymology 79, 45 1981 . Since the intramolecular disulfide bridge between the cysteine residues at positions 29 and 138 of rIFN A is believed to be required for interferon activity, these residues have not to be replaced. Similarly, the cysteine residues at positions 29 and 139 of rIFN B through L and allelic variations thereof should not be replaced. It has been shown by Shepard et al. Nature 294. 563 565 1981 that substitution of the cysteine at position 141 of rIFN ss results in a loss of biological activity.Accordingly, this cysteine residue is not to be replaced. In accordance with the present invention the cysteine residue at position 1 of rIFN aA has been replaced as well as both cysteine residues at positions 1 and 98 of rIFN aA, without any concomitant loss of interferon activity. Analogously. the cysteine residue s at position 1 and or position 99 in the case of rIFN aC through L and position 1 and or 100 in the case of rIFN aB can be replaced. In the case of a hybrid rIFN a. cysteine residues corresponding to these positions. depending upon the parental rIFN and the segment used, may be replaced. In the case of rIFN aD or a hybrid rIFN a containing an amino acid sequence of rIFN aD comprising the cystein residue at position 87 this cystein residue may also be replaced. The amino acid residues which replace the cysteine residues of the parental interferons in the polypeptides of the invention can be any amino acid residue which is incapable of participating in the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond. In the case of the N terminal cysteine residue, i.e. the residue at position 1. this is preferably replaced with glycine. In the case of internal cysteine residues. e.g. the residue at position 98 of rIFN aA.these are preferably replaced with serine. since the serine side chain most closely resembles the spatial arrangement of the cysteine side chain. Thus, substitution with serine presents the least possibility for disrupting the conformation of the molecule. While rIFN s, hybrid rIFN as, and rIFN y possess a cysteine residue at position 1, the interferon activity is retained even if this cysteine residue is deleted. Novel polypeptides of this type can be prepared using recombinant DNA methodology by which the portion of the parental interferon gene which encodes the N terminus is replaced by a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide sequence wherein the codon for the first cystein residue is missing in a manner as described in Example 1 hereinafter. In this case the ATG translation initiation signal would immeditely be followed by the nucleotide triplet encoding the amino acid residue at position 2 of the parental interferon. The resultant dsDNA can be incorporated into an expression vehicle which can be used to transform a microorganism.The transformant microorganism can then be grown up and under suitable reaction conditions will express the novel polypeptide having interferon activity the amino acid sequence of which is that of a des Cys l rIFN a. a hybrid des Cys l rIFN a or des Cys l rIFN y. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a gene encoding rIFN aA has been modified in a manner described in detail hereinafter and has been expressed to yield a rIFN aA in which one or both cysteine residues at positions 1 and 98 have been replaced by amino acid residues which are incapable of forming intermolecular disulfide bonds.Accordingly, a preferred embodiment of the present invention is a polypeptide of the formula R1 ASP LEU PRO GLN THR HIS SER LEU GLY SER ARG ARG THR LEU MET LEU LEU ALA GLN MET ARG LYS ILE SER LEU PHE SER CYS LEU LYS ASP ARG HIS ASP PHE GLY PHE PRO GLN GLU GLU PHE GLY ASN GLN PHE GLN LYS ALA GLU THR ILE PRO VAL LEU HIS GLU MET ILE GLN GLN ILE PHE ASN LEU PHE SER THR LYS ASP SER SER ALA ALA TRP ASP GLU THR LEU LEU ASP LYS PHE TYR THR GLU LEU TYR GLN GLN LEU ASN ASP LEU GLU ALA R2 VAL ILE GLN GLY VAL GLY VAL THR GLU THR PRO LEU MET LYS GLU ASP SER ILE LEU ALA VAL ARG LYS TYR PHE GLN ARG ILE THR LEU TYR LEU LYS GLU LYS LYS TYR SER PRO CYS ALA TRP GLU VAL VAL ARG ALA GLU ILE MET ARG SER PHE SER LEU SER THR ASN LEU GLN GLU SER LEU ARG SER LYS GLU wherein RÚ and Rê are amino acid residues with the proviso at least one of RÚ and Rê is an amino acid residue which is incapable of participating in the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond. Initially, the gene for rIFN aA has been modified by excision of a portion of the gene encoding the N terminus of the polypeptide including the nucleotide triplet encoding cysteine at position 1 and replacement with a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide coding for glycine at position 1.The section of the gene containing the nucleotide triplet for the cysteine at position 98 remained unchanged. The modified gene in a plasmidic expression vehicle , was expressed in E. coli to produce a polypeptide the amino acid sequence of which corresponded to the amino acid sequence of rIFN aA except that it contained a glycine at position 1 instead of cystein. The modified polypeptide is referred to hereinafter as rIFN aA Gly 1 . After extraction from the cells and purification on a monoclonal antibody immunoaffinity chromatography column, the interferon thus obtained was subjected to electrophoresis on sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel SDS PAGE . The interferon separated into a major band, corresponding to monomeric material, and a minor band, corresponding to dimeric material.A rIFN aA expressed from the unmodified rIFN aA gene was electrophoresed on the same gel and separated into several bands, corresponding to the monomer, the dimer and oligomers of higher aggregation, i.e. a trimer, tetramer, etc. The product containing a major proportion more than half of monomeric rIFN aAtGly 1 and a minor proportion of dimeric rIFN aA Gly 1 displayed the full antiviral activity characteristics of rIFN aA on MDBK cells. The gene containing the synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide segment encoding glycine at position 1 was then further modified by excision of a segment of the gene including the codon for cysteine at position 98 and replacement with an analogous synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide sequence coding for serine at position 98. This modified gene was expressed in E. coli to produce a polypeptide the amino acid sequence of which corresponded to the amino acid sequence of rIFN aA except that it contained glycine at position 1 and serine at position 98. The modified polypeptide is referred to hereinafter as rIFN crA Gly 1, Ser 98 . After extraction from cells and purification by a monoclonal antibody immunoaffinity chromatography column, the interferon thus obtained was subjected to SDS PAGE.The interferon migrated as a single band, indicating the presence of essentially only monomeric material. The product consisting essentially of monomeric rIFN aA Gly 1, Ser 98 displayed antiviral activity which was about the same as that of rIFN aA on MDBK cells. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the microorganisms useful as recipients in the transformation procedures and unless otherwise noted, are E. coli K 12 strain 294 as described in British Patent Publication No. 2055382A ATCC Accession No. 31446, deposited October 28, 1978 as well as E. coli MA210 or RR1 ATCC Accession No. 31343 .However other microbial strains many of which are publicly available or are deposited and available from recognized microorganism depository institutions, such as the AmericanType Culture Collection ATCC can also be used in accordance with the teaching of the present application. All recombinant DNA work herein was performed in compliance with applicable guidelines of the NationalInstitutes of Health. The novel polypeptides of the invention can be used for the same purposes as the known interferons in the form of pharmaceutical compositions, e.g. as antiviral and antitumor agents and in the treatment of immunosupressive conditions. Dosages and dose rates may parallel those currently being used in clinical applications of the known interferons. typically about 1 200 x 106 units daily. The polypeptides can be conveniently administered in parenteral dosage form. Suitable dosage forms can be prepared using known formulation methods to prepare pharmaceutically useful compositions wherein the polypeptide is admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier vehicle.A suitable dosage form will comprise an effective amount of the pQly peptide together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier vehicle depending upon the particular patient, the mode of administration and the condition to be treated.

In particular, the present invention provides a method of producing a double stranded DNA sequence encoding a polypeptide having interferon activity which comprises a cleaving a dsDNA containing a sequence encoding an interferon selected from a rIFN , a hybrid rIFN a, rIFN S and rIFN y with an endonuclease to produce a first dsDNA fragment containing a nucleotide triplet encoding a cysteine residue and one or more other cleavage fragments encoding the remainder of the inter feron b separating the first dsDNA fragment from the other cleavage fragments encoding the remainder of the inter feron c preparing a dsDNA sequence corresponding to the separa ted first fragment in which, however, the nucleotide triplet coding for the cysteine residue has been repla ced by a nucleotide triplet coding for an amino acid residue which is incapable of participating in the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond. said dsDNA sequence having ends complementary to the ends of the dsDNA sequence s encoding the remainder of the interferon and d ligating said dsDNA sequences in the proper orientation to yield a dsDNA sequence coding for a modified IFN. The dsDNA encoding an rIFN which is cleaved in step a above can be conveniently obtained from an expression or cloning vector containing the IFN structural gene. As a source of dsDNA to serve as a starting material from which to prepare the dsDNA encoding rIFN aA Gly 1 and rIFN aA Gly 1, Ser 98 , plasmid pL 31 was employed. This plasmid, derived from pBR322, contains a 1160 base pair b.p. insert encoding a trp promoter operator, a ribosome binding site, an ATG translation initiation signal, the structural gene encoding the amino acid sequence of rIFN aA depicted in Fig. 1 and an untranslated 3 sequence following the stop codon Goeddel et al., Nature 287, 411 i1980 . The endonucleases which can be used to cleave the dsDNA in step a are well known to those familiar with recombinant DNA technology. Which particular endonuclease is used will depend on the particular rIFN gene involved and the particular cysteine residue s to be replaced. It is well within the knowledge of the skilled worker to identify appropriate cleavage sites and to select a suitable endonuclease. The reaction conditions under which the cleavage reactions take place, as well as the methods for separating and purifying the fragments, are well known in the art. In the preparation of a dsDNA sequence encoding rIFN oA Gly 1 , advantage was taken of the existence of aSau 3AI recognition site so that it is possible to cleave the structural gene for rIFN aA immediately following the nucleotide triplet coding for cysteine at position 1 and to separate this codon from the remainder of the structural gene. The procedure which was employed to produce a dsDNA encoding rIFN oA Gly 1 can be described as follows, with specific reference to Fig. 2. The plasmid pL 31, which contained the structural gene for rIFN aA, was digested completely with Pst I and partially with Sau 3AI. An 854 b.p. fragment was isolated. The coding strand of this fragment, beginning at the Sau 3AI site contained the full DNA sequence encoding rIFN oA except the TGT codon for cysteine at position 1 and terminated at the Pst I site 360 bases beyond the TGA stop codon. The 5 end of the rIFN oA gene thus removed was replaced by ligating the 854 b.p. segment with the synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide EMI15.1 tb SEP EcoRI SEP Sau SEP 3AI tb 5 ATTCATGGGC SEP tb 3 SEP GTACCCGCTAG tb wherein the GGC codon coding for glycine replaces theTGT codon coding for the cysteine residue in the unmodified rIFN Á gene. The 865 b.p. dsDNA thus produced contained the sequence encoding rIFN aA Gly 1 and terminated with an Eco RI site at the 5 end of the coding strand and with a Pst I site at the other end. In order to modify the rIFN gene to replace an internal cysteine residue, e.g. the cysteine residue at position 98 of rIFN aA or IFN oA Gly 1 , the dsDNA encoding the rIFN can be cleaved at a first endonuclease cleavage site upstream i.e. toward the 5 end of the coding strand of the nucleotide triplet encoding the undesired cysteine and at a second endonuclease cleavage site downstream i.e.toward the 3 end of the coding strand of the nucleotide triplet encoding the undesired cysteine to isolate a fragment containing the undesired nucleotide triplet. The fragment containing the undesired nucleotide triplet is separated from the dsDNA encoding the remainder of the rIFN. A synthetic dsDNA sequence is prepared which corresponds to the removed segment except that the nucleotide triplet encoding cysteine is replaced by a nucleotide triplet encoding a different amino acid residue, preferably serine.This synthetic dsDNA sequence is then ligated in the proper orientation to the dsDNA encoding the remainder of the rIFN. If it is desired to delete two internal cysteine residues which are sufficiently close together, this may be done by cleaving the gene at a first endonuclease cleavage site upstream of the nucleotide triplet encoding the first undesired cysteine residue and at a second endonuclease cleavage site downstream of the nucleotide triplet encoding the second undesired cysteine and replacing the segment thus removed with a corresponding synthetic dsDNA sequence encoding an amino acid sequence in which both cysteines are replaced by different amino acids. With reference to Fig. 3 the following procedure to produce a dsDNA encoding rIFN aA Gly 1, Ser 98 was used.The starting material employed was an 869 b.p. dsDNA encoding rIFN oA Gly 1 . This was the 865 b.p. dsDNA produced by the previously described procedure to which additional 4 base pairs had been ligated to the 3 end in order to create a terminal Eco RI recognition site useful for insertion into an expression vector. This dsDNA was cleaved withPvu II, resulting in a 273 b.p. segment containing the 5 end of the coding strand for rIFN oA Gly 1 and a 596 b.p. segment containing the 3 end of the coding strand for rIFN oA Gly 1 including the nucleotide triplet encoding cysteine at position 98. The 596 b.p. segment was partially digested with Hinf I to produce a 48 b.p. fragment c ontaining the nucleotide triplet encoding the cysteine at position 98 and a 548 b.p. fragment encoding the remainder of the 3 end. Two synthetic double stranded DNA sequences blocks I and II were prepared to replace the 48 b.p.region of the following sequences EMI16.1 SEP 5 SEP CTGAATGACCTGGAAGCC tb 3 SEP GACTTACTGGACCTTCGGTCGCACTAT tb Pvu II Block IEMI16.2 tb SEP Hinf SEP I tb 5 SEP AGCGTGATACAGGGGGTGGGGGTGACAGAG SEP tb 3 SEP GTCCCCCACCCCCACTGTCTCTGA SEP tb Block II The AGC nucleotide triplet encoding serine in block II replaces the TGT triplet encoding cysteine in the deleted 48 b.p. fragment. Block I was ligated to the 273 b.p. fragment and block II was ligated to the 548 b.p. fragment of the original structural gene.The resulting two fragments were then ligated via their 9 base long sticky ends to produce an 869 b.p. dsDNA containing a coding strand which encoded rIFN aA Gly 1, Ser 98 , The dsDNAs encoding the novel polypeptides of the invention can be incorporated into an expression vehicle which can be used to transform a host microorganism for the purpose of expressing the novel polypeptides. Any of the known and commonly employed expression vectors may be used for this purpose, particularly plasmidic expression vectors. Incorporation of the dsDNA into an expression vector can be achieved in accordance with methods well known in the art. The vector is first linearized by cutting it with an endonuclease at a cleavage site which is appropriately.positioned with respect to a promoter operator sequence directing the expression of the inserted structural gene.The dsDNA encoding the novel polypeptide is then ligated at either end to the cleaved ends of the vector to recircularize the vector. Of course, the ends of the dsDNA insert must be complementary to the cleaved ends of the vector to allow ligation. If necessary, the dsDNA ends can be rendered complementary by building up or cleaving back the ends, using known procedures, provided that the structural gene itself and the associated initiation and termination codons are left intact and that the gene remains in the proper positions and reading frame with respect to the promoter operator sequence. Accordingly, in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, there is provided a replicable plasmidic expression vehicle comprising a a replicon b a promoter operator sequence c a DNA sequence encoding a ribosome binding site inclu ding a translation initiation signal and d a DNA sequence, in phase with said promoter operator sequence, coding for a polypeptide having interferon activity, said polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of an interferon selected from a rIFN a, a hybrid rIFN a, rIFN R and rIFN y wherein, however, at least one cysteine residue has been replaced by an amino acid residue which is incapable of forming inter molecular disulfide bonds, including a translation ter mination signal. Any of the known plasmidic expression vectors can be employed in the preparation of the replicable plasmidic expression vehicle of this invention. Preferably plasmid pRC 23 can be employed, an expression vector which is derived from pBR 322 and contains the PL promoter operator sequence Bernard, H.U. and Helinski, D.R., Methods inEnzymology 68, 482 . Details concerning the construction of the cloning and expression vector pRC 23 can be obtained from European Patent Application No. 83106730.1. In this vector, the strong Pt promoter is controlled by the cI repressor. The gene coding for the repressor carries a mutation which renders the repressor temperature sensitive.At 300C the repressor functions normally and from about 370C to about 420C it is inactivated. Thus the PL promo ter is repressed turned off at 300C and depressed turned on at 420C. The ability to control the PPromoter allows one to grow the culture at about 30 360C without expression of the gene product and then to raise the temperature to about 37 420C to produce the desired gene product. Plasmid pRC 23 is designed to accept dsDNA sequences which terminate in Eco RI recognition sites. Accordingly, the 869 b.p. dsDNA sequences previously mentioned, which encode either rIFN oA Gly 1 or rIFN aA Gly 1, Ser 98 and terminate in Eco RI recognition sites at either end.can be inserted directly into pRC 23 which has been linearized by cleavage with Eco RI. Ligation is carried out under known conditions using a known ligase, e.g. T4 DNA ligase. The replicable plasmidic expression vehicle is used to transform a microorganism, preferably E. coli, to produce a transformant which is capable of expressing the polypeptide of the invention. Transformation can be conveniently carried out using known procedures such as treating the host cells with Caul2 at about 40C. The transformed microorganism can be grown up under known fermentation conditions and the novel polypeptide expressed in the microorganism. The polypeptide is then recovered. for example, by lysing the cells and purified by known techniques. Purification can preferably be effected by immunoaffinity chromatography on a column with monoclonal antibodies to the corresponding parental rIFN which are bound to a solid support.A suitable monoclonal antibody which can be used in the purification of rIFN oA Gly 1 or rIFN oA Gly 1, Ser 98 is described. e.g.. by Staehelin et al. in Journal of Biological Chem. 256, 9750 1981 . When the expression vector employed to produce the replicable plasmidic expression vehicle is pRC 23. the resultant transformant microorganism can be grown up to a desired density at a temperature of 30 C and the temperature can then be raised to about 420C to inactivate the repressor protein and initiate expression. The following examples illustrate but do not limit the present invention. Unless otherwise stated, all parts and percents are by weight and all temperatures are centigrade. Example 1PreParation of rIFN alpha A Gly 1 a PreParation of dsDNA Encoding rIFN aA Glv 1 Plasmid pL 31 6 g containing the gene encoding rIFN aA Nature 287, 411 416 1980 , was digested completely with Pst I and partially with Sau 3AI. Both digests were performed at 370C using 20 units Pst I for 1 hr. followed by 5 units of Sau 3AI for 5 min. in a 20 1 reaction. The cleavage fragments were separated in a 1.5 agarose gel. A 854 b.p. fragment was isolated which began with the nucleotide triplet encoding Asp at position 2 of the rIFN A and terminated at the Pst I site 360 b.p. beyond the translation termination codon. Using the procedure of Miyoshi et al. Nucleic AcidsRes. 8, 5507 5517 1980 the synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides 5 AATTCATGGGC 3 GTACCCGCTAG were prepared and the 5 ends phosphorylated. The phosphorylated oligodeoxynucleotides were ligated to theSau 3AI site of the truncated rIFN aA DNA fragment 100 ng in a volume of 7 1 at 150C for 16 hours in the presence of T4 ligase. After ligation, the ligase was inactivated by incubation at 700C for 10 min. and the DNA was digested with 50 units of Eco RI and 10 units of Pst I for 2 hours at 370C in 20 1 in order to regenerate the sticky ends . The resultant 865 b.p. dsDNA fragment, which contained the coding sequence for rIFN alpha A Gly 1 , had anEco RI site at the 5 end and a Pst I site at the 3 end of the coding region. The fragment was purified through a 1.5 agarose gel and about 50 ng were recovered for cloning. b PreParation of a Replicable Plasmidic Expression Vehicle for Producing rIFN aA Gly 1 Fig. 4 is a schematic representation of the procedure which was employed to prepare the expression vehicle. We employed plasmid pRC 23 as the expression vector to prepare the replicable plasmidic expression vehicle for producing rIFN aA Gly 1 . As previously indicated, this plasmid was derived from pBR 322 and contained a PL promoter operator. Since pRC 23 was designed to accept genes on an Eco RI restriction site, it was necessary to convert the 3 Pst I site of the 865 b.p. fragment to an Eco RI site. In order to have a sufficient amount of the fragment to perform the modification, we first cloned the 865 b.p. fragment, using plasmid pBR 322, which contains a tetracycline resistance gene, as a cloning vector.We digested 500 ng of pBR 322 to completion at 37 C, with 10 units each of Eco RI and Pst I in a 20 1 reaction. The linearized vector thus produced was purified through a 1.0 agarose gel. The 865 b.p. fragment encoding rIFN aA Gly 1 50 ng was ligated with 100 ng of the linearized pBR 322 using T4 ligase in 10 1 for 8 hours at 150C. After ligation, the mixture was incubated at 700C for 10 min. and used to transform a competentMC 1061 strain of E. coli cells. The cells were plated out on LB agar containing 10 ml of tetracycline and the tetracycline resistant colonies obtained from incubation at 370C were screened for the presence of the plasmid pBR 322 rIFN oA Gly 1 .Plasmid screening was performed by the alkaline lysis procedure of Birnboim, H.C. and Doly,J. Nucleic Acids Res. 7, 1513 1979 1. Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides having the sequencesEMI21.1 tb SEP Eco SEP RI SEP Pst SEP I tb 5 SEP CGGATCCCGGAATTC SEP TGCA SEP tb 3 SEP GCCTAGGGCCCTT SEP tb were prepared by the procedure described by Miyoshi, et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 8, 55Q7 5517 1980 and phosphorylated with ATP in the presence of polynucleotide kinase at the 5 ends. The plasmid pBR 322 rIFN cA Gly 1 200 ng , which contained the 865 b.p. insert encoding rIFN oA Gly 1 , was digested to completion with 20 units of Pst I at 370C for 1 hour and the linearized vector was purified through a 1.0 agarose gel and recovered from the gel. The synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides 50 ng each were ligated to 200 ng of the linearized vector in a volume of 5 1 at 150C for 16 hours. After ligase inactivation, the resultant dsDNA was digested with 50 units of Eco RI for 3 hours at 370C. A 869 b.p. fragment encoding rIFN oA Gly 1 and terminating in an Eco RI site at either end, was purified on 1.0 agarose gel and recovered for cloning into the Eco RI site of pRC 23. About 500 ng of pRC 23 was digested to completion with 10 units of Eco RI at 370C for 1 hour in 20 1. There was added 1 Bg of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase to dephosphorylate the Eco RI ends of the plasmid and incubation was continued for an additional 30 min. The reaction was terminated by heating at 680C for 10 min. and the linearized vector was purified through a 1.0 agarose gel and recovered. The linearized vector 100 ng was ligated with 50 ng of the 869 b.p. fragment encoding rIFN aA Gly 1 in 10 1 at 150C for 10 hours to produce the replicable plasmidic expression vehicle pRC 23 rIFN oA Gly 1 . c Preparation of Transformant Containing PRC 23 rIFN aA Glv 1 The ligation mixture was used to transform an RR1 strain of E. coli cells which contained the compatible plasmid pRK 248 cIts as described by Bernard, H.U. andHelinski, D.R. Methods in Enzymology. 68, 482 . The compa tible plasmid encodes the production of the repressor protein which recognizes and binds the operator portion of thePL promoter operator on pRC 23. The E. coli cells were transformed at 40C for 30 min. in the presence of 50 mmol Caul2. The cells were plated out at 300C on LB agar containing ampicillin 50 wg ml . The pRC 23 plasmid contains a gene for ampicillin resistance.After incubation the ampicillin resistant colonies were selected and screened for the presence of the plasmid pRC 23 rIFN aA Gly 1 with the gene inserted in the proper orientation relative to the PL promoter. d Expression and Purification of rIFN oA Gly 1 A colony of transformants containing the plasmid pRC 23 rIFN oA Gly 1 and the compatible plasmid was grown up in 2 ml of LB agar containing ampicillin 50 wg ml at a temperature which was not allowed to exceed 300C. When the OD600 of the culture reached 0.6, the temperature was raised to 42 C to inactivate the repressor protein and to initiate expression. After 2 hours at 420C the cells were harvested and lysed in 50 1 of 7M guanidine HCl at OOC for 10 min. Extracts were centrifuged for 5 min. at 12,000 g. The supernatants were diluted 1 100 for antiviral assay. The rIFN oA Gly 1 was extracted from E. coli cell paste using a n ex traet inn buffer containing 2M guanidine HCl, 2 Triton x 100, 0.1M Tris Cl, pH 7.5, for 2hours at 40C. The extraction mixture was diluted five fold with cold distilled water, centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 1 hour and purified on a 1 x 2 cm immunoaffinity chromatography column. The immunoaffinity column was packed with 1.0 ml of agarose gel to which there was covalently bound approximately 13 mg of a monoclonal antibody to rIFN oA. Preparation of the monoclonal antibody, identified as Li 8, is described by Staehelin et al. in J. Biol. Chem., 256. 9750 1981 . The rIFN cA Gly l containing extraction buffer 20 ml was loaded onto the column, which was operated at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min. or less. The column was then sequentially washed with 5 bed volumes each of the following solutions 1. 0.286M guanidine HCl 0.286 Triton x 100 O.1M Tris Cl, pH 7.5 2. 0.5M NaCl 0.2 Triton x 100 0.025M Tris Cl, pH 7.5 3. 1.OM sodium thiocyanate 0.1 Triton x 100 0.025M Tris Cl, pH 7.5 4. 0.15M Nail 0.1 Triton x 100.The rIFN aA Gly 1 was then eluted from the column using an elution solvent of 0.2M acetic acid, 0.15M NaCI and 0.1 Triton x 100 at pH 2.5 The eluate from the immunoaffinity chromatography column was tested for antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis virus using the cytopathic effect inhibition test described by Familletti et al., supra. The specific activity of the eluate containing the rIFN oA Gly 1 was 2 x 108 units mg of protein, which corresponds to that of rIFN oA. Prior to raising the temperature to 42 C to initiate expression, an aliquot of the culture containing the transformants was set aside and stored in glycerol at 300C. This aliquot was then grown up in a 10 liter fermentor containing LB agar containing ampicillin 50 Bg ml at a temperature not exceeding 300C until the ODsoo reached 4 5.The temperature was then raised to 420C to initiate expression. After the OD600 reached about 12 2 3 hrs. , the rIFN oA Gly 1 was recovered and purified in a manner similar to that described above for the 2 ml culture. The purified rIFN aA Gly 1 obtained from the 10 liter culture had an antiviral activity on MDBK cells of 3.3 x 108 0.76 x 108 units mg of protein. The purified rIFN oA Gly 1 eluate from the immunoaffinity chromatography column was electrophoresed on sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel under non reducing conditions. While a sample of rIFN alpha A, displayed bands corresponding to a slow moving monomer. a fast moving monomer, a dimer, a trimer and a tetramer a sample of rIFN oA Gly 1 displayed only slow moving monomer and a small amount of dimer. rIFN aA Gly 1 which has been neutralized to pH 7.0 shows an increase in the dimer from due to pH dependent disulfide bond formation between cysteines at position 98. A sample of rIFN oA Gly 1 neutralized to pH 7.0 and reduced with ss mercaptoethanol demonstrates that the dimer is a result of disulfide bond formation. Example 2Preparation of rIFN aA Gly 1, Ser 98 5a PreParation of dsDNA Encodinq rIFN oA Gly 1. Ser 98 We prepared the dsDNA encoding rIFN oA Gly 1, Ser 98 by taking advantage of a Pvu II restriction site upstream of the nucleotide triplet in the rIFN oA Gly 1 gene encoding the cysteine at position 98 and a Hinf I restriction site downstream of this nucleotide triplet which sites are separated by 48 bases on the coding strand. Referring to Fig. 3, we employed as a starting material pRC 23 rIFN oA Gly 1 which contained the 869 b.p. insert of Example 1 encoding rIFN aA Gly 1 . The 869 b.p. segment was cleaved out of pRC 23 by digesting to ompletion with 20 units of Eco RI and 23 units of Pvu tI for 2 emirs at 370C in 20 1.The 869 b.p segment was itself cleared at the Pvu II site just upstream of the nueleotlde triplet encoding cysteine at position 98 in two fragments a 373 b.p. fragment containing the 5 end of the rIFN alpha A Gly 1 gene and a 596 b.p. segment containing the 3 end of the gene including the nucleotide triplet encoded cysteine at position 98. The 596 b.p. fragment was partially digested with 5 units of Hinf I at 370C for 5 min. in 20 1. Hinf I was then inactivated immediately at 700C for 10 min.A 548 b.p. Hinf I Eco RI fragment containing the 3 end of the rIFN aA Gly 1 gene was isolated and purified on 1.5 agarose gel eliminating a 48 b.p. fragment containing the triplet encoding the cysteine at position 98. Using the procedure of Miyoshi supra two double stranded synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides having a complementary overlapping sequence at the 3 end of the coding strand of the first oligodeoxynucleotide and the 5 end of the coding strand of the second oligodeoxynucleotide were prepared. When ligated at the complementary sequence, these two oligodeoxynucleotides produced a 48 b.p. insert which was identical to the 48 b.p. fragment cleaved out of the rIFN aA Gly 1 gene except that the nucleotide triplet encoding cysteine at position 98 was replaced by an AGC nucleotide triplet encoding serine. The two double stranded synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides had the following nucleotide sequences EMI26.1 tb 5 SEP CTGAATGACCTGGAAGCC tb 3 SEP GACTTACTGGACCTTCGGTCGCACTAT tb Pvu II Block IEMI26.2 tb 5 SEP AGCGTGATACAGGGGGTGGGGGTGACAGAG SEP Hinf SEP I tb 3 SEP GTCCCCCACCCCCACTGTCTCTGA SEP tb Block II Prior to annealing the individual strands together to produce the two double strands, the 5 ends were phosphory lated with ATP using polynucleotide kinase to allow ligation. Block I 50 ng was ligated to the Pvu II site of the 273 b.p. cleavage fragment at the 5 end of the rIFN alpha A Gly 1 gene 300 ng for 16 hours at 150C in a 7 ijl reaction.Block II 50 ng was then ligated to the Hinf I site of the 548 b.p. cleavage fragment at the 3 end of the rIFN A Gly 1 gene 100 ng for 16 hours at 150C in a 7 1 reaction. The two dsDNA fragments produced by these ligations were then ligated to each other at the 9 b.p.complementary overlapping portions of Block I and Block II for 16 hours at 150C. The resultant 869 b.p. dsDNA encoding rIFN aA Gly 1, Ser 98 was isolated and purified on a 1.5 agarose gel. The dsDNA had an Eco RI recognition site at either end. b PreParation of a RePlicable Plasmidic Expression Vehicle for Producing rIFN A Gly 1, Ser 98 Fig. 5 is a schematic representation of the procedure which was employed to prepare the expression vehicle. Plasmid pRC 23 500 ng was digested to completion with 10 units of Eco RI at 370C for 1 hour in 20 1. There was then added 1 Bg of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and incubation was continued an additional 30 min. The reaction was terminated by heating at 680C for 10 min. and the linearized vector was purified through a 1.5 agarose gel and recovered. The linearized vector 100 ng was ligated with 50 ng of the 869 b.p. fragment encoding rIFN aA Gly 1, Ser 98 in 7 W1 for 10 hours at 150C to produce the replicable plasmidic expression vehicle pRC 23 rIFN oA Gly 1, Ser 98 . c PreParation of Transformant Containing sRC 23frIFN i Glv 1, Ser 98 The ligation mixture was used to transform an RR1 strain of E. coli containing the compatible plasmid pRK 248 cIts, encoding the production of the temperature sensitive repressor protein which recognizes and binds the operator sequence of PL promoter operator on pRC 23.The E. coli cells were transformed at 4 C for 20 min. in the presence of 50 mmol CaC12. Ampicillin resistant colonies resulting from overnight incubation at 300C on LB plates were selected and inoculated into 2 ml cultures of LB agar containing ampicillin 50 ILgImI . Colonies containing the recombinant plasmid pRC 23 rIFN oA Gly 1, Ser 98 with the gene inserted in the proper orientation relative to the PL promoter were selected by screening with the alkaline lysis method of Birnboim supra . d Expression and Purification of rIFN oA Gly 1, Ser 98 A colony of transformants containing the plasmid pRC 23 rIFN oA Gly 1, Ser 98 and the compatible plasmid was grown up in 10 liters of LB agar and ampicillin 50 Bg ml at a temperature which was not allowed to exceed 300C. When the OD600 of the culture reached 0.6.the temperature was raised to 429C to inactivate the repressor protein and initiate expression. After 2 hours at 420C the cells were harvested and lysed. The rIFN oA Gly 1. Ser 98 was extracted from E. coli cell paste using 4 volumes of the buffer of Example l d and purified on d 1.6 x 5.0 cm immunoaffinity chromatography column. The immunoaffinity chromatography column was packed with 10 ml of agarose gel to which there was covalently bound approximately 130 mg of a monoclonal antibody to rIFN oA. Preparation of the monoclonal antibody, identified as Li 8, is described by Staehelin et al. in J.Biol. Chem., 256, 9750 1981 . The rIFN oA Gly 1, Ser 98 containing extraction buffer 5.000 ml was loaded onto the column, which was operated at a flow rate of 5.0 ml min. or less. The column was then sequentially washed with 5 bed volumes of the same washing solutions employed in Example l d . The rIFN aA Gly 1, Ser 98 was then eluted from the column using the same elution solvent as in Example l d . The eluate from the immunoaffinity chromatography column was tested for antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis virus using the cytopathic effect inhibition test described by Familletti supra . The specific activity of the eluate containing the rIFN Á Gly 1, Ser 98 was 2 x 108 units mg of protein, which corresponds to that of rIFN oA. The purified rIFN oA Gly 1, Ser 98 eluate from the immunoaffinity chromatography column was electrophoresed on sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel under non reducing conditions. While the sample of rIFN oA Gly 1, Ser 98 displayed a single band of monomeric interferon a sample of rIFN aA displayed bands corresponding to the monomer, a dimer, a trimer and higher oligomers.
