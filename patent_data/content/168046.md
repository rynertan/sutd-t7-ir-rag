## Description
The present invention relates to a magneto optical recording material in or from which information is written, read and erased with a laser beam, and more particularly to a magneto optical recording material which has a high corrosion resistance and a great magneto optic effect well suited to enhance a readout signal to noise radio S N or C N . Recently, the magneto optical recording which affords a high recording density as well as a large memory capacity and which is capable of, e. g., random access to and erasure of information has come into the limelight. In the magneto optical recording, a magnetic thin film having an easy axis of magnetization in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the film a perpendicularly magnetized film is used, and reverse magnetized domains are formed at any desired positions with a light beam, whereby binary data of 1 and 0 are written in correspondence with the senses of the magnetizations. On the other hand, the binary signals subjected to such reverse magnetized writing are usually read out by exploiting the polar Kerr effect or the Faraday effect. As the magneto optical media, there have heretofore been proposed perpendicularly magnetized films such as an MnBi crystalline film, a rare earth transition metal amorphous film and a garnet single crystal thin film. Among them, the rare earth transition metal amorphous thin film is deemed the most promising at present for the reasons that medium noise is little owing to the absence of a grain boundary and that a large homogeneous area is easily prepared. As the rare earth transition metal amorphous thin films, Fe based alloy systems including Fe Tb, Fe Gd, Fe Tb Gd and Fe Tb Gd Dy or ones in each of which Fe in an amount smaller than 50 at. is replaced with Co that is, the Fe content is larger than the Co content , such as Fe Co Gd, Fe Co Dy, Fe Co Tb, Fe Co Tb Gd and Fe Co Dy Tb, and Co based alloy systems including Co Gd, Co Tb, Co Gd Tb and Co Tb Dy are presently under researches as disclosed in, for example, the Official Gazettes of Japanese Patent Application Laying open No. 52 31703, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 57 34588, Japanese Patent Application Laying open No. 56 126907, German Patent Application laying open No. 33 17 101, Japanese Patent Application Laying open No. 57 94948 and Japanese Patent Application Laying open No. 58 73746. In addition, the Kerr rotation angle in the residual magnetization of the film itself has been enhanced to approximately 0.35 at a wavelength of 633 nm . However, Kerr rotation angles or Faraday rotation angles attained with these prior art alloy systems are insufficient for producing a readout signal level in practical use, and enhancement in the magneto optic effect of the film itself for raising the S N ratio still more is requested. As regards overall characteristics required of the magneto optical recording media, the Fe based recording films have such disadvantages that when the Kerr rotation angle ϑ An object of the present invention is to provide a magneto optical recording material for use in an amorphous magneto optical recording medium, which is well suited for practical use owing to a sufficiently great magneto optic effect, a high readout S N ratio or C N ratio attained, and a favorable corrosion resistance as well as a high crystallization temperature. In order to accomplish the object, the magneto optical recording material of the present invention is rendered a material whose composition formula is indicated by Co The inventors have led to the present invention in such a way that in a perpendicularly magnetized amorphous film of a Co Tb binary system having a high corrosion resistance, the moment of the magnetic element contributive to a Kerr rotation angle is enlarged by replacing part of Co with Fe that a corrosion resistance, a crystallization temperature, etc. are enhanced by adding an element of the platinum group such as Ru, Rh, Pd or Pt, or Nb, Ni, Cu, Ag, Al, B, Si or Ge and that the Kerr rotation angle is further improved and simultaneously the Curie temperature is optimized by replacing the constituting element Tb with a different rare earth element, so that the performance of a magneto optical recording film is enhanced. Further aspects of the invention are given in the independent claims 2 and 3. As regards the perpendicularly magnetized film mentioned above, it has also been revealed that even in a case where part of Co is replaced with at least one element selected from the group consisting of the elements Ni, Cu, Ag, Al, B, Si and Ge and where Fe is not contained, effects similar to those in the aforementioned case where Fe is contained are achieved. In case of employing the material of the present invention for a magneto optical recording medium, it may be deposited on a substrate as a thin film 20 to 150 nm thick likewise to the magneto optical recording materials in the prior arts. Also the substrate may be made of a material hitherto used, for example, glass, polymethylmethacrylate PMMA or polycarbonate. In order to readily produce a perpendicularly magnetized film made of the magneto optical recording material of the present invention by the use of conventional sputtering or evaporation, the value Attaining a magneto optic effect greater than that of the prior art Co Tb film, can be achieved by substituting Fe for part of Co. However, when the amount of substitution A rare earth element in a rare earth transition metal amorphous film contributes to making the alloy film an amorphous structure and a perpendicularly magnetized film. In this regard, Tb is also contributive to the stabilization of perpendicular magnetization by increasing a coercive force Hc and simultaneously increasing magnetic anisotropy energy Ku. Accordingly, it is more preferable that Tb is contained in the constituent R of the aforementioned composition formula. The case containing Tb and the case not containing Tb are collectively indicated by the composition formula Co Favorable results were obtained in cases where, in the above composition formula, R was a single element selected from the group consisting of Tb, Gd, Dy and Ho, and M, It is also effective that thin films having the alloy compositions stated above are further doped with some impurity elements to the end of more improving the recording sensitivity, the corrosion resistance and the lifetime. The expression substantially amorphous material is intended to mean a material with which a diffraction line corresponding to a crystal plane does not appear definitely in an ordinary X ray diffraction test. Now, the present invention will be described in conjunction with examples. In the ensuing examples, an amorphous alloy film was formed on a substrate in such a way that sputtering was carried out by a magnetron sputtering method or by a bias sputtering method in which a minus bias voltage of 20 V to 150 V was applied to the substrate, using a composite target wherein one or more rare earth elements and additional elements each being in the shape of a square plate each side of which was 5 mm long were arranged on a Co disc 110 mm in diameter so as to establish a predetermined composition in terms of an areal ratio, or that a mother alloy of predetermined composition was prepared by vacuum arc melting, whereupon electron beam evaporation was carried out using the mother alloy. Except for Example 5, the substrate was made of glass in the shape of a disc having a thickness of 0.3 mm and a diameter of 10 mm. Samples of this example were prepared by the magnetron sputtering method under the conditions of an Ar atmosphere pressure of 3.67 Pa and a radio frequency power input of 1 kW. The thicknesses of the prepared amorphous films were constant at approximately 100 nm. Amorphous films used as samples of this example were prepared by the electron beam evaporation under the condition of a vacuum degree of 1.3 x 10 ⁴ Pa. In this example, Kerr rotation angles ϑ In this example, Kerr rotation angles ϑ Regarding each sample for measuring the Kerr rotation angle, after the amorphous film was prepared, an SiO₂ protective film was formed thereon to a thickness of about 50 nm by evaporation in order to prevent the oxidation of the surface thereof. The Kerr rotation angle was measured through the substrate. The wavelength of light used for the measurement of the Kerr rotation angle was 633 nm as in Examples 1 and 3. Each sample for measuring the reflectivity change was not provided with the SiO₂ protective film which was formed on the sample for measuring the Kerr rotation angle. The reflectivity change is the proportion in of the reflectivity R t after the sample was let stand for 50 days under the conditions of a temperature of 60 C and a humidity of 95 , to the reflectivity R 0 before it was let stand, and it is indicated by 100 R t R 0 . That is, the value of the reflectivity change is normalized by the value of the reflectivity at the time of the preparation of the film. The measurement of the reflectivity was performed from the amorphous film side by employing the light of the wavelength of 633 nm. It is understood from Table 2 that the amorphous film of the composition in which part of Co is replaced with Fe is large in the value of the Kerr rotation angle ϑ As apparent from Table 2, the Fe₇₅Tb₂₅ amorphous film in the prior art exhibits a great reflectivity change and is therefore inferior in the corrosion resistance. In general, Fe based amorphous alloy films other than this Fe₇₅Tb₂₅ film mentioned here are also inferior in the corrosion resistance. In contrast, the alloy films of the magneto optical recording materials according to the present invention are favorable in the corrosion resistance. In the alloy films of the present invention, Co in the transition metals accounts for at least 50 , which plays an important role for the improvement in the corrosion resistance. Further, by adding Al, Nb, Ni or the like, the corrosion resistance can be still bettered without degrading the Kerr rotation angle. As apparent from the above description, the Co based perpendicularly magnetized amorphous film of the present invention has been found an excellent magneto optical recording material which is superior in the thermal stability, the corrosion resistance etc. and which can afford a greater read output to noise ratio C N .
