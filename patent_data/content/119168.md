## Description
The multiple ovulation, or super ovulation, induced in cattle, goats and sheep, is a basic point, in order to obtain certain goals of the utmost interest for the agricultural economy programmed pregnancies, twin pregnancies and especially the embryonal transplant. In the bred animal species the embryonal transplant serves to obtain, from a particularly gifted female for instance a high production of milk a maximum quantity of ovules being fertilized with sperm of selected males. These genetically superior embryos are transplanted into other animals being apt to carry out the pregnancy to the end. Schematically, the embryo transplant may be subdivided into two steps The result of the super ovulation does not reach, in several cases, a good economic result, due to the following reasons There is general agreement, on the fact that the hormonal stimulation procedure for several follicles requires the most careful adjustment and tuning. The multiple ovulation, or super ovulation, is normally induced by means of the administration, either of PMSG Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotropin having been extracted from the blood of a pregnant mare, or otherwise of FSH Follicle Stimulating Hormone having been extracted from the hypopyses of bred animals, such as pigs and horses. PMSG has had for many years a dominant position in the super ovulation of all bred animals, owing to its large availability together with its easy administration. This hormone, consisting of one molecule only which has joint activities of the FSH type and of the LH type, has a very high content of n acetyl neuraminic acid and remains in the circulation for many days after one injection only. Therefore it is possible, with PMSG, to obtain a satisfactory stimulation by means of the administration of the usual dosage in one injection only. However, the responses to the super ovulation treatments, made with PMSG, are too variable, even when the use of the hormone is performed within exact programs and terms. Moreover, the PMSG produces some alterations of the ovaric structures, which are evident, after administration, by long delays in recurrence of the spontaneous cycles. These delays are much longer than those resulting from super ovulating treatments with other kinds of Gonadotropins. It appears that even the lengthy presence of PMSG in the circulation could be the cause of some undesirable effects, such as the variable response, and the production of a high percentage of abnormal embryos. For the above mentioned reasons, there is now a trend to replace PMSG by FSH, extracted from the hypophyses of bred animals. According to what is know from the literature, the product most in use is FSH P, consisting of an FSH extracted from pig hypophyses and whose dosage is made in eq. mg of the standard Armour FSH. The American patent 2,799,621 1957 issued to Armour, states that FSH obtained according to the process as described in it is particularly useful because it is essentially devoid of LH. Moreover, the patent states that this fact is, in itself, an important discovery, because FSH has some applications wherein the substantial lack of the LH is useful. From all the recently issued literature it results that the administration scheme actually preferred consists of the administration of 30 to 32 mg of FSH P, without any addition of LH, over a period of 5 days. The main purpose of the present invention is a composition of FSH and LH being extracted from pig hypophyses, in a definite ratio, giving results which are superior to those obtained both with FSH P and with PMSG, in inducing super ovulation in bred animals. Another purpose of the present disclosure is a method to induce super ovulation in bred animals, consisting of administering to said animals the above mentioned composition of FSH and LH. Other purposes of the discovery shall be evident from the following description. The FSH LH ratio, in the composition made according to the present disclosure, is contained between 0.5 and 2.5 when the dosage of FSH and of LH is performed respectively with the Steelman and Pohley Steelman S.L. and Pohley F.M. Endocrinology 53 604.1953 and with the Parlow methods Parlow A.F. in Albert A. ed. Human Pituitary Gondadotropins 300 310 C.C. Thomas, Springfield, Illinois , using as reference preparation the 1st hMG International Standard for biological dosages of FSH and LH. The method to extract and refine the FSH LH composition being produced from pig hypophyses according to the present disclosure is described in detail as follows. The raw material used in this process consists preferably of frozen hypophysis glands of pigs, which must be carefully collected and stored. In the normal process of the industry, the extracts are separated from the residue or insoluble part by means of centrifugation, although other separation methods may of course be used. In the same way, the dialysis may be replaced by ultra filtering methods. All stages of the method must be carried out at a sufficiently low temperature, in order to prevent denaturation of the gonadotropins. Temperatures under 10 C are usually advised. The frozen pig hypophyses are thawed at 4 C in acetone containing phenyl methane sulphonyl fluoride, and then homogenized. The homogenized material is filtered, washed several times with acetone, pre cooled, and dried under vacuum, in order to obtain an acetonic dust. The acetonic dust is added to the acetate ethanol buffer pre cooled at 4 C, pH5, containing 40 of ethanol and phenyl methane sulphonyl fluoride. The mixture is stirred for 20 hours at 4 C. The centrifugation of the extracted product with acetate ethanol gives a clear supernatant which is adjusted to an ethanol content of 80 . The precipitate so obtained is collected by decanting and centrifugation. Later an extraction in an ammonium bicarbonate solution is carried out in order to eliminate the insoluble proteins, then the insoluble residue is removed by centrifugation, the supernatant is dialyzed against water and then lyophilized, in order to obtain raw porcine gonadotropins. A solution of raw material is prepared in distilled water, and adjusted to 5.3 pH and to 30 saturation with ammonium sulphate. The precipitate obtained is removed by centrifugation and the supernatant adjusted to 7.3 pH and to 50 saturation with ammonium sulphate. The precipitate, containing the greatest part of LH, is later collected by means of centrifugation, dialysed against water and then lyophilized. This fraction, later indicated as LH fraction , contains also some small quantities of FSH. The ammonium sulphate concentration of the supernatant is then adjusted to 90 , saturation, and the mixture is left at rest for several hours. The precipitate, rich in FSH, is collected, dialyzed and lyophilized. This fraction, to be indicated later as FSH fraction , also contains some small quantities of LH. The FSH fraction and the LH fraction obtained by the method described above are contaminated, respectively, by minor quantities of LH and FSH. The entity of contamination varies from one preparation to the other, and must be exactly determined in both fractions, in order to calculate the quantities required to obtain a mixture with the desired composition of FSH and LH. The starting materials to prepare a mixture of FSH and LH in a definate ratio are The x and y quantities, expressed in milligrams, respectively for the FSH fraction and the LH fraction to be included in the mixture in order to obtain a composition containing T units of FSH and an FSH LH ratio R result from the following formulae For instance, x milligrams of an FSH fraction containing 27.3 Int. Units of FSH per milligram, and 6.73 Int. Units of LH per milligram, must be mixed with y milligrams of an LH fraction containing 8.9 Int. Units of FSH per milligram and 811.7 International Units of LH per milligram, in order to obtain T 120,000 Int. Units of FSH with a ratio R FSH LH 1. By applying the above, one has Therefore,4359.2 mg of the FSH fraction must be mixed with 111.7 mg of the LH fraction in order to obtain a composition containing 120,000 International Units of FSH and 120,000 International Units of LH ratio FSH LH 1 . The induction of a super ovulation in order to obtain from a donor female, a maximum quantity of live and transplantable embryos was and is now the target, with hormones and administration schedules of various kinds, in all the bred animals. Recently, to the above mentioned breeds, also animals used in pharmacological research, such as monkeys, dogs and cats, have been included. However, some statistically convalidated results are available only for cows, as it results from the general review on the subject published in 1977, by the Department of Agriculture of Canada Betteridge K.J., Editor, 1977, Canada Department of Agriculture, Monograph 16 . Calculations based on more than 1700 donor cows indicate that the yield of transplantable empbryos, although extremely variable, is, on an average, under 5 per animal. Moor R.M. et al, Vol. I page 43, 9th International Congress on Animal Reproduction and Artificial Insemination Madrid, 1980 The composition according to the present invention has been tested in the bovine species, with results far superior to the above indicated average. A schedule of treatment with mixtures of FSH and LH prepared in accordance with the present invention and suitable for Frisian cows in the full milk producing period, consists of the administration of a total of 1000 International Units of FSH and 1000 Int. Units of LH in decreasing dosages, over a period of 5 days starting from the 9th to 11th day of the estral cycle. On the evening of the third day of treatment 1 ampoule of Prostaglandin is administered in order to provoke luteolysis. Two or three artificial inseminations arc made, starting 12 hours from the onset of the estral period. On the seventh day after the second insemination, the embryos are removed, in a non surgical way, by washing the uterine horns. With this system all embryos resulting from the fertilization of the ovuli produced, as well as the non fertilized ovuli, if any, are collected in a container. The collected embryos are carefully examined under the microscope and subdivided, according to their morphological features, into transplantable and non transplantable embryos. In Frisian cows during their milk producing period, treated with the above mentioned program, the following average figures are obtained In the meat producing breeds, such as marchigiane or chianine , a total dosage of 750 Int. Units of FSH and 750 Int. Units of LH is sufficient. The administration program of this dose, and every other detail of the treatment, is identical to that already described for the Frisian cows in the milk producing period, In the marchigiane and chianine cows, the following averages are obtained It is very important to emphasize, that the above reported average figures result from the treatment of animals on the field . It is well known to the experts, that the results are considerably improved when treatment is made, instead of on the field , in a specialized Clinic, where all the animals may be treated in full respect of all technical conditions.
