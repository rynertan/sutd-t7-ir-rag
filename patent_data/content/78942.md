# Storage element reconfiguration.

## Abstract
This is a system which is used to perform reconfigura tion of storage elements in order to permit removal of one or more of the elements for servicing or other reasons. If a storage element that is to be taken off line contains material that is crucial to the continued operation of the system, that material is copied to appropriate areas in other storage elements. After all crucial material has been copied to alternate locations, the original storage element can be taken off line for servicing or other purposes.
