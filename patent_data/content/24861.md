# Stackable containers for plants or the like.

## Abstract
A container 2 such as a plant holder is provided with formations at its lower end to enable it to be stacked on other such holders in a staggered formation so that none of the supporting containers need be closed off. The containers are polygonal, so that they can be interlocked in edge to edge formation A or corner to corner formation B. Drain holes are provided so as to enable the upper containers of an array to drain into the lower ones and then to supporting trays 3 .
