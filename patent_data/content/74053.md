# MEDICAL COUCH

## Abstract
The medical couch contains a lower frame, an upper frame for carrying a table top, and a link mechanism interconnecting both frames. The link mechanism includes pivotally interconnected support arms which are operated in a scissor action to lift and lower the upper frame with respect to the lower frame. An electronic motor drive system containing an electric motor and a lead screw is provided for performing such operation. The drive system is pivotly connected to the lower frame such that the lead screw extends towards the upper frame. The pivoting axis is arranged horizontally. A nut element which is mounted on the lead screw travels therealong when the motor is in operation. The nut element is provided for supporting the link mechanism and pivotly connected therewith. The nut element will be pivoted about an upper horizontal axis when it travels along the lead screw. The nut element moves the upper frame to a selected horizontal position above and parallel to the lower frame.
