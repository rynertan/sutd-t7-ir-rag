## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF FLUDORINATED PYRIDINES The invention relates to a process for the preparation of fluorinated pyridines. It is known from the Journal of the Chemical Society, 1965, 594 597, to contact pentachloropyridine with potassium fluoride in an aprotic solvent, viz. N methyl 2 pyrrolidone at 2000C under reflux, to yield fluorinated pyridine derivatives. Up to 74 of fluorinated pyridine derivatives were obtained, viz. up to 65 of 3,5 dichloro 2,4,6 trifluoropyridine and up to 9 of 3 chloro 2,4,6 tetrafluoropyridine. Th the process according to the prior art the reaction is carried out in an amount of more than 870 grams of N methylpyrrolidone per mol potassium fluoride. This amount of solvent is required in order to abtain a stirrable mixture. It has now been found that the presence of an aromatic hydrocarbon ccm√ßaund has a tremendous impact on the selectivity and the yield of fluorine containing pyridine derivatives. It appears that by changing the nature of the solvent higher yields of fluorine containing pyridine derivatives can be obtained. The present invention therefore provides a process for the preparation of a fluorinated pyridine in which a chlorine containing pyridine derivative is contacted at elevated temperature with an alkali metal fluoride in a solvent, wherein the solvent comprises a mixture of at least one aprotic amide and at least one aromatic hydrocarbon. The process is especially applicable to the replacement of chlorine by fluorine in chlorine containing pyridine derivatives which contain a chlorine substituent in the 2 , 4 and or 6 position. The present process can be applied to pyridine derivatives which contain only one chlorine substituent, e.g. 2 chlcro 3 nitro pyridine or 4 chloro 3 cyarro pyridine . Preferably the pyridine derivative contains two or more chlorine substituents. A very suitable starting material for the process according to the invention is pentachloropyridine. When the latter compound is used in the process according to the invention not only a high yield of fluoropyridines is obtained, but also a high selectivity towards 3,5 dichloro 2,4,6 trifluoropyridine. In the process according to the invention the alkali metal fluoride used may oonveniently be sodium, potassium, rubidium or cesiiin fluoride, potassium fluoride being particularly preferred. The amount of the alkali metal fluoride is conveniently at least one mol of alkali metal fluoride per gram atan of chlorine to be replaced. It is preferred to use an excess of alkali retal fluoride.Especially when more than one chlorine substituent is present and not all chlorine substituents are to be replaced, for example as in the case of the preparation of 3,5 dichloro 2,4,6 trifluoropyridine from pentachloropyridine, the molar ratio of alkali metal fluoride to chlorine atoms to be replaced is advantageously in the range 1 1 and 1.3 1. The aprotic am present in the solvent mixture may be for example an optionally substituted dialkylamide of a carboxylic acid containing up to 10 carbon atoms e.g a dialkylfermamide or a dialkylacetamide or a N alkyl lactam e.g. a N alkyl gamma butyrolactam a N alkyl pyrrolidone or N alkyl caprolactam . The alkyl groups attached to nitrogen preferably contain fran 1 to 6 carbon atans. It is preferred to use N methylpyrrolidone or N,N dimethylacetamide. Suitable aromatic hydrocarbons include benzene and alkyland alkanybenzenes in which at least one C1 C4 alkyl or C2 4 alkenyl group is connected to the benzene ring. Preferred are benzene, toluene, o , m or p xylene or mixtures thereof, especially toluene. Preferably, the weight ratio of aprotic undo to aromatic hydrocarbon is in the range from 10 90 to 90 10, more preferably from 65 35 to 20 80. Use of the solvent comprising a mixture of at least one aprotic arnide and at least one aromatic hydrocarbon generally allows a readily stirrable mixture to be obtained using slightly more than 150 grams of the solvent per mol of alkali metal fluoride. Therefore the use of relatively snall scale equipment will suffice for the process according to the present invention.Of course it is possible to employ greater quantities of the solvent. The solvent is preferably present in an amount from 170 750 grams per mol of alkali metal fluoride. It is preferred to effect the process at a temperature in the range from 800C to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. The reflux temperatures of the preferred solvent mixtures, e.g. mixtures of toluene and N methylpyrrolidone or dimethyl a acetamide within the preferred weight ratio ragge, are well below 2000C at atmospheric pressure, due to the boiling point decreasing effect of the toluene in the mixture. The possibility to operate in the present process at temperatures belaw 2000C represents a considerable economic advantage over the prior art process. The present process may if desired be carried out at elevated pressures, e.g. up to 10 bar. This implies, that the reflux temperature of the solvent mixture increases. Reaction temperatures in the range 90 and 1700C, are preferred. The process of the invention may be performed without a catalyst. However, it has been found that the reaction rate can be enhanced by using a phase transfer catalyst, and in the present process a phase transfer catalyst is preferably included in the reaction mixture. Suitable catalysts include crown ethers, e.g. lS crown 6 etber, and quaternary ammonium and phosphonium compounds, e.g. tetramethylphosphoniumchloride.Preferably the phase transfer catalyst is a tetraalkyl ammonium halide, conveniently a tetraalkyl amonium chloride. Each alkyl moiety in such a catalyst may conveniently be a C16 alkyl group, C1 4 alkyl groups, e.g. methyl and or butyl groups, being preferred. The presence of water in the reaction mixture is undesirable. The use of anhydrous reactants is therefore preferred. However, since alkali metal fluorides are hygroscopic the presence of a little ansunt of water is almost unavoidable. Due to the use of an aromatic hydrocarbon containing solvent mixture the reaction mixture can conveniently be dried by azeotropic distillation. Thereto the alkali metal fluoride and the chlorine containing pyridine derivative are preferably dried before mixture with the amide s by mixing them with the aromatic hydrocarbon s and removing water from the mixture obtained by azeotropic distillation. The distillate contains water and part of the aromatic hydrocarbon s .The latter part can be dried in any known menner and be reused in the process according to the present invention. A particularly preferred process in accordance with the present invention is a process for the preparation of 3,5 dichloro 2,4,6 trifluoropyridine in which pentachloropyridine is contacted with potassium fluoride, the molar ratio of potassium fluoride to pentachloropyridine being from 3 1 to 3.9 1, in a solvent wherein the solvent comprises a mixture of at least one aprotic amide selected fran N methylpyrrolidone, N,N dimethylacetamide andN,N dimethylformamide, and at least one aranatic hydrocarbon selected fran benzene, toluene and o , m and p xylene, the weight ratio between the aprotic amide s and the arcoatic hydrocarbon s ranging fran 65 35 to 20 80, and wherein the reaction temperature ranges fran 80 C to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. 3,5 Dichloro 2,4,6 trifluoropyridine may conveniently be converted into the 4 amino pyridine derivative by treatment with ammonia. Accordingly, the invention also provides a process in accordance with the invention as defined above wherein the fluorinated pidine is 4 amino 3,5 dichloro 2,6 difluoropyridine, in which pentachloropyridine is contacted at elevated temperature with alkali metal fluoride in a molar ratio alkali metal fluoride pentachloropyridine in the range 3 1 to 3.9 1 in the solvent, followed by treatment of the resulting 3,5 dichloro 2,4, 6 trifluorapyridine with ammonia. Certain chlorofluoropyridine may be used as intermediates in the preparation of agrochemicals. For this reason polychloropyridines are the preferred feedstocks for the process according to the present invention. Thes 3,5 dichloro 2,4,6 trifluoropyridine can easily be ooeereed into 4 amino 3,5 dichloro 2,6 difluoropyridine, and subsequently into berbicidal 4 amino 3,5 dichloro 6 fluoro 2 pyridyloxy acetic acid derivatives, as described in British patent applicatian No.2,039,473.

From the Experiments above it is apparent that only in experiment 8 a satisfactory replacement reaction has taken place, the reaction being carried out in a mixture of NMP and toluene. Further the reaction mixture in experiments 4 and 5 were unstirrable. Exairple III An experiment was run in which 4 amino 3,5 dichloro 2,4 difluoropyridine was prepared starting fran PCPy without isolation of TFPy as intermediate product. In a vessel 362g toluene, 193g PCry 0.77 mol 4.2g TMAC and 160g KF 2.75 mol were mixed. At 1210C 190g toluene with 3g water was distilled off. Subsequently, to the remaining mixture 285g DMAC was added and the reaction mixture was heated at 1350C for 4 hours. Then solids were filtered off from the reaction mixture 202g and washed with toluene. The filtrate was purified by flash distillaticn yielding 23.5g residue which was discarded. Through the distillate 24g NH3 was bubbled whilst stirring. The temperature was kept at 200C. The slurry obtained was filtered and the filtered NH4F was washed with toluene. The filtrate was objected to fractionated distillation yielding toluene and DMAC separately. To the amino product containing bottoms fraction water was added, the product thereby being precipitated. After filtration, washing and drying 128g amino product was obtained 0.64mo1 , representing a yield of 83 mo1. based on PCPy. The product consisted of 94.2 of 4 amino 3,5 dichloro 2,6 difluoropyridine and 5.8 of 2 amino 3,5 dichloro 4,6 difluoropyridine.
