# Components for electric motors.

## Abstract
A component of an electric motor includes a plastics body 80 , at least one brush box 81 made of electrically conduct ing material mounted on the plastics body and having brushes 83 for making contact with a rotor of the motor, and an electrical conductor 106 to which the brush box is con nected. The brush box 81 includes a base formed with lateral flanges 88 and the electrical conductor 106 has a predeter mined shape configured to wrap round the flanges of the brush box. The conductor cannot be moved out of engage ment with the brush box without moving the brush box and a sound electrical connection is thus ensured.
