# Nitriles and primary amines from primary alcohols.

## Abstract
Nitriles and primary amines are produced by a vapour phase reaction involving the reductive amination of a primary alcohol with ammonia and hydrogen in the presence of a copper chromite dehydrogenation catalyst. The nitriles produced are readily convertible to the same corresponding primary amines. The reaction may be conducted at a temperature of 240 to 320 C which is substantially lower than the temperatures used in other methods used to make nitriles. Conversions of the alcohols are 95 higher, and selectivities to the combined primary amines and nitriles are higher than other methods.

## Description
NITRILES AND PRIMARY AMINES PROM PRIMARy ALCOHOLS The invention relates to the catalytic production of nitriles and primary amines from primary alcohols, and more particularly relates to the production of nitriles and primary amines at lower temperatures over a catalyst containing copper and chromium. The production of primary amines from primary alcohols and ammonia would be a very desirable process if it could be performed with high selectivity to the amines. The reductive amination of secondary alcohols proceeds well, but primary alcohols frequently give undesired by products including secondary amines and hydrogenolysis products. For example, Japanese Patent 75 30,804 Chemical Abstracts 83 580181g relates that a nickel copper chromium catalyst may convert ammonia and l butanol at a 93 conversion, to n butyl amine in only 64 selectivity at a temperature of 205 C and a pressure of l58 bars. The same patent reveals that n dodecanol may be converted to dodecyl amine in 55 selectivity.High conversions would be necessary in a process such as this because of the proximate boiling points of the primary amine and primary alcohol, and therefore the distillation to remove the unreacted alcohol would be difficult. Further,Japanese Patent 75 32113 C. A. 83 78568z teaches that higher selectivity to the primary amine may be achieved but at the expense of conversion. In that patent, the conversion of dodecanol to dodecyl amine is achieved with 95.3 selectivity, but at a 71.7 alcohol conversion. The reaction therein was conducted at 120 to 2200C under atmospheric pressure using a cobalt catalyst containing magnesium, calcium, zinc, cadmium and or manganese. A titanium oxide molybdenum oxide catalyst yields decyl amine and l decene from l decanol in the vapor phase according to Takita, Y. Seyiama, T. and Nishida, Y., Bull.Chem. Soc. Japan, 49 12 , pp 3699 3700, Dec. 1976. In that article, the highest n decyl amine selectivity achieved was 68.7 at 11.2 conversion. French Patent 1,302,365, which corresponds toBritish Patent 934,636, indicates that a nickel catalyst may promote the formation of primary, secondary and tertiary amines from ethylene glycol monomethyl ether in yields of 35, 40 and 3 , respectively. None of these methods has been able to convert primary alcohols to primary amines with both high conversions and high selectivities. There has been recent work in the vapor phase reductive amination of primary alkanols with secondary amines to produce the corresponding tertiary alcohols in high selectivity. The catalyst employed was copper chromite supported on silica, and other copper catalysts. See, for example Baiker, A. and Richarz, W., Helv. Chem. Acta, 61, pp 1169 1174 1978 Baiker, A. and Richarz, W., SyntheticComm., 8 1 , pp 27 32 1978 Baiker, A. and Richarz, W.,Tet. Lett., 1977, pp 1937 38 also Preprints Can. Symp.Catal., 5th, 1977, Chem. Inst. Can., Ottawa, Ontario, pp 1169 1174 and finally German Offen. 2,535,073 issued on Feb. 17, 1977. Typically, conversions and selectivities are greater than or equal to 97 . Nitriles have been formed from amines or by the amination of alcohols over variousrcatalysts, but only at higher temperatures than those used in the inventive method.For example, Migrdichian in The Chemistry of Organic Cyanoqen Compounds, ACS Monograph No. 105, Reinhold, New York, 1947, p 168 see also U. S. Patents 2,337,421 and 2,337,422 indicates that alkyl amines are converted to nitriles at 320 to 3300C over nickel catalysts or at 400 to 4200C over copper catalysts. Alcohols can be converted to nitriles in the presence of ammonia over dehydrogenation catalysts at 300 to 4000C. Another group has reported the same reaction overFeS at 450 C, Zakirov, N. S., Absurakhmanov, E. A., andKusainov, Kh. Sh., Sammarkand Neftekhimiya, 1978, 18 T , 75 9 C. A. 88 169565r . Other workers have used zinc oxide or magnetite as the catalyst, as shown in Jodra, L. G. Arogan, J. M. andCorella, J., Acta Cient Compostelana, 14 i , 1977 , pp 85 102 C.A. 87 133846y . Japanese investigators have reported mixtures of secondary amine, nitrile and hydrocarbons from the treatment of l butyl amine with hydrogen over a cobalt molybdenum aluminum oxide catalyst at approximately 200 to 5000C, Hattori,T. Kanetake, K. and Murakami, Y., Nippon Kaguku Kaishi, 1977 11 , pp 1591 96. Production of nitriles from alcohols or aldehydes at 4700C over a zinc oxide on aluminum oxide catalyst has been taught in German Offen. 1,816,279, issued on July 16, 1970, and French Patents 1,550,144 and 1,562,129. The invention concerns a method for the continuous production of nitriles and primary amines from primary alco hols by means of reductive amination comprising reacting a primary alcohol with ammonia and hydrogen, all in the vapour phase, in the presence of a copper chromite dehydrogenation catalyst containing copper. A mixture of primary amines and nitriles is produced1 according to the invention, and the nitriles may be converted into primary amines by conventional hydrogenation.The method of this invention has a much higher selectivity to primary amines, or materials whibh may be readily converted to primary amines, than the selectivities exhibited by related methods in the field. Also, nitriles may be formed at a substantially lower temperature as compared with the related art methods. It should also be noted that, although high alcohol conversions are obtained by this method, secondary amine by products are produced in very low amounts. The reactants used in the method of this invention include primary alcohols, ammonia and hydrogen. The primary alcohols should have a boiling point sufficiently low to permit vapourisation at temperatures and pressures of desired operation. It is especially preferred that the alcohol has no amine substituent in the beta position that is, on the second carbon atom counting from the carbon atom with the hydroxyl group. The catalyst useful in this invention is copper chromite. The catalyst may be supported by any common support material, such as silica gel. The reaction may be conducted at a variety of temperatures, however, it is preferred that the temperature be between 240 and 3200C. Also, the pressure may range from one atmosphere or below to several atmospheres. It is important, however, that the conditions be such that the reactants are all in the vapor phase. Generally, the application of pressure will cause the reactants to be in the liquid phase, and as shown, in the examples, the product distribution changes toward secondary amines when pressure is applied. It is also especially preferred that the reaction be conducted in a continuous fashion. It is not unusual to have alcohol conversions on the order of 95 or higher when the method of this invention is employed. It is also not unusual for the combined selectivities to nitrile and primary amine to be 95 or higher. The hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines is so conventional it is mentioned in basic organic chemis texts. See, for example, A. Streitwieser, Jr. and C. H.Heathcock, Introduction to Organic Chemistry, Nacmillan New York, 1976, pp 781 782. Catalysts which are useful in this hydrogenation include nickel copper chromia and cobaltcopper chromia combinations, especially the latter. The method of this invention also provides an easier route to the production of 2 methoxyacetonitrile as compared with the method disclosed by P. A. Argabright, et al., Chemistry and Industry, 1964 30 , p 1365. TheArgabright, et al. method is a difficult route which employs the reaction of sodium cyanide with methylchloromethyl ether to produce the methoxy acetonitrile. Methoxyacetonitrile is an interesting type of bi functional compound which might be useful for solvent applications, for instance, such as a butadiene extraction solvent. Direct amination of 2 methoxy ethanol is much preferred over using sodium cyanide. The method of this invention will be further illustrated by the examples which follow. EXAMPLE E Amination of l octanol Over Copper Chromite at 2450C In a heated 25 mm ID quartz glass column was placed lOOce of copper chromite catalyst tablets. A mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen was passed through the catalyst bed maintained at 300 5000C in order to activate the catalyst.Then the hot part of the catalyst bed was maintained at 244 2460C while a mixture of l octanol 0.194 mole hour , ammonia 3.16 mole hour and hydrogen approximately 180 cc minute was passed downward through the tube effluent was collected in an ice cooled bath. Gas liquid chromatography analysis indicated 63.3 conversion of l octanol.Selectivities to octane nitrile, 1 amino octane and dioctyl amine were 35.1, 36.3 and 8.5 , respectively. Selectivities do not add up to 100 due to minor amounts of unknowns. E X A N P L E II Amination of l Octanol Over Copper Chromite at 2820C The procedure of Example I was essentially repeated except that the temperature was raised to 2820C and the l octanol feed rate was increased to 0.203 mole hour.Conversion of 1 octanol was 97.4 selectivities to nitrile, primary amine and dialkyl amine were 80.9, 15.8 and 0 8S, respectively. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis confirmed this gas liquid chromatography result in that proton integration ratios indicated approximately 83 octane nitrile and 17 l amino octane. This experiment illustrates the high conversion and high selectivity to primary amine and potential primary amine nitrile which is possible with this method. E X A M P L E xxr Amination of l Octanol Over Copper Chromite Supported on Silica Gel at 2820C The procedure of Example It was essentially repeated except that 95 cc of copper chromium on silica gel was substituted for the copper chromite. Conversion was 92.2X and selectivities to nitrile, primary amine and dialkyl amine were 81 1, 14.5 and ,7X, This experiment illustrates the high selectivities but slightly lower activity provided by this catalyst The manufacturer lists the CuO and Cr203 content of this catalyst as 22.0 and 1.03 , respectively . E X A N P L E XV Amination of 1 Octanol Over Copper Chromite Supported on Silica Gel at 3050C When this catalyst was used at 3050C under the same conditions as in Example III, the l octanol conversion was 95.2 and selectivities to nitrile, primary amine and secondary amine were 90.1, 6.7 and 0.6 , respectively. E X A M P L E V Amination of l Octanol Over Copper Chromite at 8,9 bars Pressure The procedure of Example II was repeated with the following differences only 25cc of catalyst were used, the catalyst was contained in a stainless steel tube and the contents were maintained at 8.9 bars total pressure. The l octanol feed rate was approximately 0.05 moles hour, and the temperature was 2750C. The conversion of l octanol was 99X selectivities to nitrile, primary amine and secondary amine were 3.4, 58.2 and 33.5 , respectively. This experiment illustrates the detrimental effect of conducting the amination under pressure as the dioctyl amine constitutes a substantial portion of the product. Under these conditions, the 1 octanol was in the liquid phase, not the vapor phase. E X A N P L E VI Amination of 2 Methoxyethanol Over Copper Chromite The catalyst and procedure of Example I was repeated except that only 60 ml of catalyst was used, 2 methoxyethanol was substituted for 1 octanol, the temperature was 2950C and the alcohol feed rate was 0.224 moles hour. The conversion of alcohol was 96.2 selectivities to methoxyacetonitrile, 2 methoxyethylamine and di 2 methoxyethyl amine were 52.8, 16.2 and 8.0 , respectively. E X A M P L E VII Amination of 2 Methoxyethanol Over Co Cu Cr Catalyst The procedure of Example VI using a catalyst containing cobalt, copper and chromium at 2809C resulted in only 14 conversion of methoxyethanol to yield predominantly 2 methoxyethylamine. These examples and others conducted under similar conditions are summarized in Table I. TABLE 1 EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATING THE INVENTIVE METHOD Mole Temp., Ratio Mole Hr Pressure,Ex. Catalyst OC NH3 Alc.

The combined yield of primary amine and nitrile potentially a primary amine also decreases with pressure. At the highest temperature shown in Table III 3050C , unknown compounds made a relatively large contribution, so total selectivities were down. See also Table I, Examples 5, 9 to 11 and 16 to 19. Copper chromite seems to be unique in promoting nitrile formation at relatively low temperatures. Other types of copper chromite, such as copper chromite on silica gel, appeared less active and lost their activity faster than copper chromite. Sometimes after prolonged idle time, even the copper chromite appeared to deactivate. The cobalt copper chromium catalyst used in Example VII is not a satisfactory catalyst for vapour phase conversion of primary alcohols to amines. At about 2800C and one bar, conditions under which copper chromite gives good conversions, only a 14 conversion of methoxyethanol, predominantly to methoxyethylamine was realized. Diethylene glycol DEG and N,N dimethylethanol amine DME do not appear as suitable for conversion to primary amines with ammonia and hydrogen over copper chromite as does methoxyethanol. At 3050C, DEG at atmospheric pressure undergoes less than 50 conversion to a large number of products. At 260 3100C and pressures of 12.0 35.5.bars,which are vapor phase conditions, DME undergoes good conversions greater than 95 , but the selectivity to any one product is poor. N,N Dimethylethylenediamine appears to be the At atmospheric pressure, the nitrile nd prlmary amine appear to equilibrate. In two separate runs at 2900C, l octanol and l octyl amine produced nearly identical product ratios. See Table II below.

Since the operating temperature is well above the critical temperature of ammonia, the reaction between nitrile and primary amine both in the liguid phase when conducted under pressure is favored. This pressure effect was checked using methoxyethanol amination. The reaction was conducted at 1.0, 10.0, 23.4 and 173.4 bars. Yield of products are listed in Table III below.

At high temperatures it may decompose to dimethyl amine, formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide a reverse Strecker reaction . Evidence of this behavior was found during atmospheric pressure amination of hydroxyethylmorpholine. At 2750C, only 31 conversion was achieved. The main products were morpholine 77 selectivity , N methylmorpholine 10 and cyanomethyl morpholine 6 . Hydrogen cyanide and methanol were identified in the off gas. From Examples 24 to 33 it may be seen why it is preferred that there be no amine substituents in the beta position of the primary alcohol.
