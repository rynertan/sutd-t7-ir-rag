## Description
This invention relates to a novel polypeptide and a process for producing the same, more particularly to a novel polypeptide having an action of lowering Ca² concentration in blood and a process for producing the same. Calcitonin hereinafter called CT has hitherto been known as a polypeptide having the action of lowering Ca² concentration in blood. CT can be collected by extraction from thyroid glands of various mammals such as human being or from ultimobranchial glands of fish, cyclostomata, birds, its amino acid primary sequence has been clarified, and a number of synthetic CT s with similar structures based on this sequence have also been reported. These CT s derived from animals are all polypeptides consisting of 32 constituent amino acids, and all common in that the first and the seventh amino acids are L cysteine, mercapto groups of both form a disulfide bonding and the carboxylic group end hereinafter called C end is prolineamide. Recently, the present inventors extracted and purified CT from the ultimobranchial glands of chickens and determined its structure to find that it has a structure entirely different from those known in the art represented by the following formula I wherein Cys represents cysteine, Ala alanine, Ser serine, Leu leucine, Thr threonine, Val valine, Gly glycine, Lys lysine, Gln glutamine, Glu glutamic acid, His histidine, Tyr tyrosine, Pro proline, Arg arginine, Asp aspartic acid. This CT has biological activity which is equal to or higher than CT s of cyclostomata and fish, and has already been published as Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 123500 1985 which corresponds to U.S. Serial No. 679,465 and European Patent Application No. 84 114 768.9 . The chicken CT is expected to be novel pharmaceutical useful for various symptoms such as Paget s disease, osteoporosis or hypercalcemia in which Ca² concentration in blood is abnormally high. However, for making this acceptable as a pharmaceutical, it is necessary to overcome the problem caused by the disulfide bonding possessed by the chicken CT, which is estimated to be very unstable in solutions and may cause lowering its physiological activity. Accordingly, the present inventors have made extensive studies with an object to obtain a stable CT derivative even in a solution state on the basis of the structure of the chicken CT, and consequently found that the above object can be accomplished by using in place of the first and the seventh cysteine in the chicken CT α amino acid of the following formula II wherein The present invention concerns a novel polypeptide represented by the following formula III or its acid addition salt or complex wherein Ala, Ser, Leu, Thr, Val, Gly, Lys, Gln, Glu, His, Tyr, Pro, Arg, Asp and The novel polypeptide of the present invention or its acid addition salt or complex can be produced as described below. That is, it can be produced by forming a peptide or polypeptide having the amino acid sequence represented by the above formula III and subjecting the structural units containing a peptide residue represented by the formula wherein R represents an active ester residue, being hereinafter the same, formed in any step of the reaction to cyclization reaction. This process can generally be practiced by protecting the active group with a suitable protective group and eliminating the protective group in any desired step of the reaction. As the α amino acid represented by the above formula II , those of the formula wherein The reaction itself is conducted by repeating elimination of protective group and condensation reaction following conventional means in peptide synthesis.

Next, protection of various amino acids is to be described. Hydroxyl groups of the above Ser, Thr, Tyr can be protected by, for example, esterification or etheration. The groups suitable for this esterification may be, for example, lower alkanoyl groups such as acetyl group, etc., aroyl groups such as benzoyl group, etc., groups derived from carbonic acid such as Cbz group, ethoxycarbonyl group, etc. On the other hand, groups suitable for etheration may include, for example, Bzl group, tetrahydropyranyl group, t butyl group, etc. For protection of these hydroxyl groups, 2,2,2 trifluoro 1 t butoxycarbonylaminoethyl group, 2,2,2 trifluoro 1 benzyloxycarbonylaminoethyl group are also suitable. However, these hydroxyl groups are not necessarily required to be protected. The α amino group of the above Lys can be protected with Cbs group, o,m,p chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl group, Tos group, etc. The side chain carboxyl group of the above Glu and Asp can be protected with a benzyl ester hereinafter called OBzl group. The imino group of the above His can be protected with, for example, Bzl group, trityl group, Cbz group, Tos group, adamantyloxycarbonyl group, 2,2,2 trifluoro 1 t butoxycarbonylaminoethyl group, 2,2,2 trifluoro 1 benzyloxycarbonylaminoethyl group, etc. However, this imino group is not necessarily required to be protected. As the protective group for the guanidino group of the above Arg, for examle, nitro group, Tos group, Cbz group may be employed, but this guanidino group is not necessarily required to be protected. In the present invention, condensation of amino acids may be performed either by condensing amino acids one by one in succession, or by condensing peptides or polypeptides comprising two or more amino acids. Such a condensation can be practiced by, for example, allowing an amino acid or a peptide or a polypeptide having a protected α amino group and an activated terminal carboxylic group to react with an amino acid or a peptide or a polypeptide having free α amino group and as protective terminal carboxylic group, or allowing an amino acid or a peptide or a polypeptide having an activated α amino group and a protected terminal carboxylic group to react with an amino acid or a peptide or a polypeptide having a free terminal carboxylic group and a protected α amino group. In this case, the carboxylic group can be activated by converting into, for example, an acid azide, an acid anhydride, an acid imidazolide or an active ester such as cyanomethyl ester, thiophenyl ester, p nitrothiophenyl ester, p methanesulfonelphenyl ester, thiodiester, p nitrophenyl ester hereinafter called ONP , 2,4 dinitrophenyl ester, 2,4,5 trichlorophenyl ester, 2,4,6 trichlorophenyl ester, pentachlorophenyl ester, N hydroxysuccinimide ester hereinafter called OSU , N hydroxyphthalimide ester, 8 hydroxyquinoline ester or N hydroxypiperizine ester, etc. or by treating with carbodiimide, N,N carbonyl diimidazole or isooxazolium salt, for example, Woodward reagent. In the present invention, the preferable condensing method may include the carbodiimide method, the azide method, the active ester method and the mixed acid anhydride method. Among them, it is more preferable to employ the method in which racemization in each step becomes minimum, for example, the azide method, the active ester method, N hydroxysuccinimide hereinafter called HOSU N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide hereinafter called DCC method or 1 hydroxybenzotriazole hereinafter called HOBT DCC method. The structural units containing of the peptide thus prepared are subjected to cyclization reaction in any desired step of synthesis, and this cyclization is performed by condensation reaction between the side chain carboxylic group of the α amino acid represented by the formula II which has been activated by the method as described above and the free amino group of N terminal amino acid Ala . During this reaction, the hydroxyl groups of Ser and Thr should preferably be protected. The preferable method of the present invention is practiced by condensing a cyclic peptide or polypeptide with active groups protected or unprotected containing the α amino acid represented by the above formula II with another polypeptide with active groups protected or unprotected, and subsequently eliminating the protective groups, if any. More specifically, the N terminal fragment comprising amino acids from No. 1 at the N end to No. 6 No. 9 is condensed with the polypeptide of all the remaining sequence from No. 7 No. 10 to No. 31, and, in this case, Gly should advantageously be C end amino acid in view of the reactivity in condensation of the fragments and prevention of racemization. Accordingly, in the present invention, it is most preferable to condense a peptide comprising an amino acid sequence of No. 1 to No. 9 with a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence of No. 10 to No. 31. This condensation can be conducted according to the azide method starting from azide or hydrazide or the active ester method, the mixed acid anhydride method, etc. Next, preparation of N end fragment is described in detail by referring to synthesis of nonapeptide 1 9, but hexapeptide 1 6, heptapeptide 1 7 and octapeptide 1 8 can also be prepared according to entirely the same method. Formation of this nonapeptide is carried out by condensing successively individual amino acids or lower peptides containing two or more amino acids with C end amino acid Gly or C end fragment following its amino acid sequence. Individual amino acids, for example, Gly, Leu, Val, ω carboxy α amino acid, Thr, Ser, Ala should advantageously be condensed according to the active ester method. Lower peptides, for example, dipeptide 2 3, should advantageously be condensed according to the HOBT DCC method. Also, hexapeptide 1 6 should advantageously be prepared by condensation of tripeptide 1 3 with another tripeptide 4 6 according to the azide method. During synthesis of nonapeptide, its terminal carboxylic group is not necessarily required to be protected. For example, when condensed according to the azide method, the active ester method or the mixed acid anhydride method, its terminal carboxylic acid is not required to be protected, but these groups should desired to be protected by esterification as described above. For example, they can be protected by esterification with methanol, benzyl alcohol. These ester groups, for example, methylester groups can be decomposed within short time with a dilute sodium hydroxide solution, preferably a 1 N 2 N sodium hydroxide solution, or decomposed after being converted to hydrazide. On the other hand, benzyl ester groups can be decomposed by hydrogenation. The amino groups of these intermediates are protected with conventional protective groups such as Cbz group, trityl group, BOC group, diphenylisopropoxycarbonyl group. Also, the carboxylic groups of these intermediates may be esterified in a conventional manner, if desired. The hydroxyl groups of its Ser, Thr and Tyr can be protected by etheration with t butanol, benzyl alcohol, etc., if desired. Of the above mentioned groups, Cbz group, p nitrobenzyl ester group and OBzl group can be eliminated or decomposed by hydrogenation in the presence of palladium carbon, N trityl group eliminated by an aqueous acetic acid, BOC group eliminated by trifluoroacetic acid hereinafter called TFA , o nitrophenylsulphenyl group eliminated by an organic solvent containing hydrogen chloride or by prussic acid or sulfurous acid, and diphenylisopropoxycarbonyl group eliminated by a mixture of glacial acetic acid formic acid water 7 1 2 . On the other hand, t butyl ester is decomposed with TFA similarly as t butyl ether. Further, synthesis of C end fragment from No. 7 No. 10 to No. 31 to be condensed with the above N end fragment is to be described in detail. It is preferable to condense individual amino acids or lower peptides comprising 2 to 4 amino acids successively with C end amino acid amino acid of No. 31 Pro or C end fragment, for example, peptides 30 31, 28 31, 26 31, 25 31, 24 31 or 23 31, following its amino acid sequence. For example, the C end fragment 10 31 can be synthesized by condensing from the C end side individual amino acids or lower peptides, for example, dipeptide 28 29, dipeptide 26 27, tripeptide 20 22, dipeptide 17 18, dipeptide 15 16, tripeptide 10 12, according to the active ester method, the HOBT DCC method, etc. Here, protection of α amino groups and functional groups of respective amino acids is the same as described above. The protective group for the above C end fragment from No. 7 No. 10 to No. 31 having the protected α amino group, for example, docosapeptideamide 10 31, can be eliminated according to the method as described above. The two peptides obtained, namely the N end fragment from No. 1 to No. 6 No. 9 and the C end fragment from No. 7 No. 10 to No. 31 are condensed according to the method as described above to give a protected polypeptide. The protective groups in this protected compound can be eliminated according to the methods as described above, preferably the method by acid decomposition, for example, the method with the use of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, to give the objective substance shown by the above formula III . The novel polypeptide of the present invention may be obtained in the form of base or its salt depending on the conditions of the process. Such a base or its base is convertible to each other according to the known methods. Also, such a base can also be allowed to react with an acid suitable for formation of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, perchloric acid, etc. organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, lower alkanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid hereinafter called TosOH , etc. to form a corresponding salt. The above novel peptide can form a complex by addition of certain kinds of inorganic substances or organic substances. Such substances may include inorganic compounds derived from metals such as calcium, magnesium, aluminum, cobalt or zinc, particularly slightly water soluble salts or hydroxides of these metals such as phosphates, pyrophosphates or polyphosphates and polyphosphates of alkali metals. Also, as the organic substance which can persist its action, there may be employed, for example, non antigenic gelatin, carboxymethyl cellulose, sulfonic acid ester or phosphoric acid ester of alginic acid, dextran, polyalcohols such as polyethylene glycol, phytic acid, polyglutamic acid, protamine, etc. According to the present invention, a CT derivative which is stable even in a solution state can be supplied.
