# Improved preparative process for alkaline earth metal, aluminum containing spinels.

## Abstract
An improved process for the production of alkaline earth, aluminum containing spinel compositions, preferably magne sium, aluminum containing spinel compositions and preferably further comprising at least one additional metal component, comprises combining an acidic aqueous solution and a basic aqueous solution containing an aluminum component to form a combined mass combining the combined mass with an aque ous solution containing at least one alkaline earth metal to form a precipitate and calcining the precipitate to form a spinel com position. The product spinel composition, preferably with in cluded additional metal components, is particularly suited for use in reducing the amount of sulfur oxides emitted from a ca talyst regeneration zone, e.g., a catalytic cracking unit regene ration zone.
