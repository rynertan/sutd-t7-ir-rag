# Process for the treatment of glucose feedstock and for its enzymatic conversion to fructose.

## Abstract
Commercial glucose solutions used as feedstock for enzymatic conversion of glucose to fructose using glucose isomerase often contain materials which act as poisons toward the enzyme. It has been found that these poisons can be removed, or destroyed, by treatment of the feedstock with oxidizing agents, chief of which is hydrogen peroxide, at a pH of from 6 to 9 and a temperature of 10 to 80 C.

## Description
Process for the treatment of glucose feedstock and for its enzymatic conversion to fructose Fructose grape sugar has been used as a sugar substitute in many applications. Increasing sugar prices spur increased fructose usage, and current fructose production is at an all time peak. The largest commercial source of fructose is glucose, an end product of starch hydrolysis, which is isomerized to fructose by enzymatic methods using glucose isomerase.Because the high enzyme cost dictates its reusability, the isomerization is not done homogeneously, where recovery of enzyme would be difficult and costly, but instead is performed heterogeneously, using glucose isomerase immobilized in some manner. That is, either cells containing glucose isomerase, or the enzyme itself, are physically and or chemically bound to a support through which flows a glucose feedstock, with isomerization of glucose to fructose resulting from contact of the feedstock with the immobilized glucose isomerase system IMGI . It is highly desirable to have the IMGI as productive as possible. A measure of its productivity is its halflife, by which is meant the time necessary to reduce the activity of an IMGI to one half its initial value.We have repeatedly observed that the half life of anIMGI was substantially longer using a purified glucose feedstock than with a commercial feedstock. These observations led us to the discovery that the deleterious effect on IMGI half life was directly associated with the presence in the feedstock of carbonyl containing components which formed a precipitate with 2,4 dinitro phenylhydrazine. It was further discovered that removal of these components, or poisons, from the feedstock led to a substantial increase in the half life, and thus the productivity, of IMGI. A crucial discovery leading to the invention described herein is that certain oxidiz ing agents very effectively alter these poisons, or deleterious components, chemically in a glucose feedstock, thereby rendering them innocuous and, in effect, removing the poisons initially present. An object of this invention Ls therefore to increase the productivity of immobilized glucose isomerase systems. According to the invention there is provided a process of treating a glucose feedstock prior to enzymatic conversion to fructose comprising contacting the feedstock with an effective amount of an oxidizing agent at a pH from about 6 to about 9 at a temperature from about 10 to about 800C. In one specific embodiment the oxidizing agent is hydrogen peroxide. In one more specific and preferred embodiment the oxidizing agent is hydrogen peroxide and is used at a pH from about 7.5 to about 9. It has been found that such treatment substantially increases the productivity Sf the enzyme glucose isomerase when used in an immobilized enzyme system, such increasing productivity being manifested by an increased half life cf the IMGI. The invention therefore includes a process for the production of fructose by enzymatic conversion of a glucose feedstock using glucose isomerase, especially in the form of IMGI, in which the feedstock is pretreated with an oxidizing agent at a pH of from 6 to 9 and a temperature of from 10 to 800C. The problem which this invention solves is that commercial glucose feedstocks for fructose formation via IMGI frequently contain poisons which substantially reduce the productivity of IMGI as manifested by its half life. For example, if an IMGI has a half life of 70 to 80 days with a purified glucose feedstock, theIMGI may have a half life of only from about 25 to 40 days with a commercial glucose feedstock. For the purpose of this application, the term poisons refers to materials found in commercial glucose feedstocks which contribute to a decrease in half life of immobilized glucose isomerase. A characteristic common to all glucose feedstocks exhibiting a deleterious effect on the half life is the presence of components in minor amounts which form precipitates with 2, 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine. Al though the nature of these minor components is not known with certainty, it was possible qualitatively to correlate their amount, via their derivatives. with 2,4 dinitrophenylhydrazine, with the extent of the reduction in half life of IF GI. It was found from that correlation that the greater the amount in the feedstock of components which form derivatives with 2,4 dinitrophenylhydrazine, the less the half life of the IMGI was.It also was observed that when feedstocks in which such components were initially absent were treated so as to induce formation of these components, the resulting feedstocks substantially reduced the half life of IMGI. An inference which may be drawn from these observations is that the minor components forming precipitates with 2,4 dinitrophenylhydrazine are themselves poisons or that the presence of the poisons is associated with the presence of the minor components. Although it is unknown which inference is the more correct one, this invention may be successfully practiced nonetheless.Similarly, although at least one of the minor components may be a 3 deoxyhexosone, it is not known unequivocally that this is present when precipitates form with 2,4dinitrophenylhydrazine, nor is its effect as a poison independently known. It was subsequently discovered that treating the feedstock containing the poisons with certain oxidizing agents destroys the aforementioned minor components, with the treated feedstock showing no deleterious effect on enzyme productivity. This discovery led to the process of this invention, which is essentially a method of removing certain minor components from a glucose feedstock, components whose presence have a deleterious effect on the productivity of the IMGI. In the process of this invention glucose feedstocks are treated with an effective amount of an oxidizing agent. Among the oxidizing agents which may be used in the process of this invention are hydrogen peroxide, other peroxides, hypohalites, especially hypochlorites and hypobromites, perhalates, especially perchlorates and perbromates, and persulfates. Hydrogen peroxide is a highly preferred oxidizing agent. Other preferrei oxidizing agents include the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts of hypochlorites and perchlorates. The amount of oxidizing agent effective in the practice of this invention depends somewhat on the oxidizing agent, the amount of poison present in the feed, and the pH at which treatment is performed. Generally, the oxidizing agent of this invention will be effective in amounts from about 50 to about 500 ppm. In particular, when hydrogen peroxide is used at a pH from about 7.5 to about 9, an amount from about 50 to about 250 ppm constitutes an effective amount, and an amount from about 1PO to about 200 ppm is even more desirable. As the pH decreases, the amount necessary to be effective in the practice of this invention increases. As previously stated, the process of this invention is pH dependent. It is found that the lower the pH, the greater must be the amount of oxidizing agent used.On the other hand, it is found that at a pH greater than about 9 there are formed color bodies which are undesirable from a commercial aspect. Thus, a pH range from about 6 to about 9 is used in the practice of this invention, and the range from about 7.5 to about 9 is preferred. The contact time is dependent upon the temperature, pH, the amount of oxidizing agent used, and the amount of undesirable component present. A temperature from about 10 to about 800C may be employed, but a range from about 50 to about 700C is preferred in order to minimize contact time without adversely affecting the feedstock.At a pH of about 9 with about 200 ppm hydrogen peroxide, a contact time of about 90 minutes at 200C, or 20 minutes at 600C, is adequate to maximize the beneficial effects of the process of this invention. It is to be understood that at a different pH and or using a different oxidizing agent, the necessary contact time may differ from that stated above, but can be readily determined through simple experimentation. Where it is necessary to remove residual oxidizing agent prior to contacting the glucose feedstock withIMCI, this may be done by treating the feedstock with bisulfite, sulfite, charcoal, , iron ferrous or ferric , or catalase. For example, feedstock with residual oxidizing agent may be passed through a bed of charcoal. As another example, residual oxidizing agent may be removed by adding a sulfite to the glucose feedstock. When this latter mode of treatment is chosen, it is found that from about 100 to about 1000 ppm of sulfite is preferred to be added. The examples below are merely illustrative of this invention and the discovery underlying it. In all the examples the IMGI used was a preparation in which glucose isomerase was immobilized onto a support matrix composed of alumina impregnated with polyethylenimine subsequently cross linked with excess glutaraldehyde so as to furnish excess pendant aldehyde groups. The reactors used were of the fixed bed type operated at 600C with feedstock in an upflow mode and a space velocity sufficient to afford 42 fructose in the effluent. EXAMPLE I In this example two reactors , each containing IMGI, were run in series. The feedstock was 45 weight weight purified glucose Cerelose Registered Trade Mark containing 0.1 sodium sulfite and 7 ppm sodium omadine at pH 8.0. The feedstock gave no precipitate when treated with 2,4 dinitrophenylhydrazine. It had been found by independent experimentation that passage of the purified feedstock through the IMGI caused formation of undesirable minor components. In this example the normal mode of operation consisted of passing the feedstock through the first reactor, then using the effluent from the first reactor as the feed for the second reactor under otherwise identical operating conditions.In this mode the IMGI in the second reactor performed only a small chemical change to 48 fructose since the feed to it, at 42 fructose, was already near equilibrium for the liquid hourly space velocity used. However, the IMGI in the second reactor was exposed to poisons formed in the first reactor. Periodically, the second reactor was fed with the purified glucose feedstock and its activity measured.This was done solely in order to determine the half life of its IMGI. It was found that the half life of theIMGI in the first reactor was about 144 days, whereas the half life of the IMGI in the second reactor was about 84 days. This demonstrates the effect of poisons in the feedstock on the half life of IMGI. EXAMPLE II Commercial feedstock containing operationally appreciable amounts of poisons, as determined by formation of 2,4 dinitrophenylhydrazine derivatives, was treated with varying amounts of hydrogen perox ide at pH 9 for 90 minutes at room temperature. When the peroxide was used at a concentration greater than about 100 ppm no observable precipitate formed. When the peroxide was used at levels between 25 and 50 ppm an observable precipitate formed. When peroxide was absent a fairly heavy precipitate formed. Thus, poisons were present at a level requiring at least 50 to about 100 ppm of oxidizing agent in this particular feedstock. EXAMPLE III A portion of a commercial feedstock was treated for 90 minutes at ambient temperature and pH 9.0 with 20 p ppm hydrogen peroxide. Excess peroxide was destroyed by addition of 1000 ppm sodium sulfite and the pH was adjusted to 8.2. Another portion of the feedstock was treated identically except hydrogen peroxide was omitted.The two feedstocks were used in two reactors operating in tandem to determine half life of the IMGI. Results are given below. Hydrogen Peroxide Untreated Treated Feed Feed Initial Activity 1500 1370 units per gram Half life days 74 38 Thus, hydrogen peroxide treatment increases the half life of IMGI by a factor of almost two relative to untreated material.
