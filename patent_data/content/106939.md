# Method and apparatus for simulating a magnetic tape storage equipment in a data processing system.

## Abstract
Method for simulating read time operations of a mag netic tape storage equipment, in which the simulating ap paratus 17, 18 receives an arbitrary length train of data bytes clocked at a first rate followed by a cyclic redundancy check CRC byte timed at a slower second rate. In order to maintain system transparency, the simulating apparatus must retransmit the data and CRC check bytes, in their received order and at their respective reception rates, after a delayed associated with the physical separation between recording and reproducing heads in the magnetic tape storage equipment.
