# Improvements in and relating to viscous fluid coupling devices.

## Abstract
A driven member for a viscous shear fluid coupling has a housing part which comprises a spider member 21 of steel or other ferrous metal having an annular centre boss 25 with a bore which receives a journal bearing 15 . The spider member 21 hat a plurality of radially extending arms 29 . A step 16 on each of the radially extending arms 29 acts as a location spigot for a fan or other driven device. The radially outer end of each of the arms 29 terminates in a respective boss 33 which extends in a direction parallel to the spider and coupling axis. An annular disc member 23 is fixed co axially to the spider member 21 . The annular steel disc member 21 has a bore 39 of smaller diameter than the bore 27 of the spider member centre boss 29 and an outer periphery attached to a cover part 19 . A respective threaded stud is located in the bore 33 of each boss 31 at the termination of each radial arm 29 . The studs 18 are fixed to the annular disc mem ber 23 or to the spider member 21 .
