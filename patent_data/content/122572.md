## Description
The present invention relates to the preparation of catalyst supports and catalysts used for the conversion of hydrocarbons, and more particularly to the preparation of hydrocarbon cracking and hydroprocessing catalysts that are particularly effective for the processing of residual hydrocarbon feedstocks. Catalysts which are used for the conversion of hydrocarbons typically comprise particulate inorganic oxide supports combined with catalytically active metals and or crystalline zeolites. Hydroprocessing catalysts generally contain Group VI and or Group VIII metals combined with a formed support component which comprises alumina or silica alumina. Cracking catalysts comprise crystalline zeolites such as Type Y faujasite or ZSM zeolites which are prepared by combining the crystalline zeolite in finely divided form with an appropriate inorganic oxide matrix which comprises silica, alumina and or clay. Clay, due to its low cost and availability, is a particularly attractive raw material for the preparation of catalysts. U.S. 2,939,764 describes a method for preparing artificial bauxite wherein kaolin clay is calcined at a temperature of about 900 to 10000C and then treated with sodium hydroxide solution to leach or remove silica as a soluble sodium silicate. U.S. 3,932,268 describes fluid cracking catalysts which comprise an ion exchanged faujasite type Y zeolite and an amorphous matrix wherein the matrix comprises the alumina silica residue of caustic leached kaolin clay. The zeolite component is prepared in situ within a preformed calcined clay particle by the treatment of calcined kaolin microspheres with caustic. The remaining alumina silica residue which is not converted to zeolite remains and serves as a catalyst matrix. U.S. 4,235,753 describes a method for preparing shaped crystalline aluminosilicate containing particles wherein calcined clay particles are reacted in an aqueous alkaline medium which contains aluminosilicate nucleation centers. In recent years the refining industry has been processing increasing amounts of metal containing residual hydrocarbon feedstocks. The metals, primarily vanadia and nickel, tend to deactivate catalysts, and thereby increase the overall cost of processing residual feedstocks. Accordingly, a significant requirement exists for hydrocarbon conversion catalysts which are resistant to the deactivating effects of vanadia and nickel and which may be prepared from readily available inexpensive raw materials such as kaolin. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide improved hydrocarbon conversion catalysts and catalyst components. It is another object to provide cracking catalysts which are active for the conversion of residual hydrocarbon feed stocks to valuable lower molecular weight products such as gasoline and diesel fuel. It is another object to provide hydroconversion catalysts and catalyst supports which are economical to prepare on a commercial scale and which are particularly resistant to the deactivating effects of metals contained in residual type feedstocks. These, and still further objects of the present invention will become readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following detailed description and specific examples. Broadly, our invention contemplates catalysts, catalyst components, and catalyst supports which contain or comprise caustic leached spinel compositions which may contain substantial quantities of mullite. More specifically, we have found that valuable catalysts and catalyst components may be prepared from a caustic leached spinel and mullite hereinafter frequently referred to as CLS mullite which has a high concentration of acid sites that are resistant to hydrothermal deactivation. The preparation of calcined leached kaolin clays including spinels is generally disclosed in the prior art. However, the CLS mullite used in the practice of the present invention is particularly characterized by the ability to retain a high degree of catalytic activity as measured by acid site stability, i.e. retention of acid sites subsequent to hydrothermal treatment. This high degree of stability is obtained by careful control of the caustic leaching conditions, and in particular it is found that where the spinel calcined kaolin is leached reacted with sodium hydroxide solution for a period in excess of about 6 hours, a substantial amount of hydrothermal stability is lost. Accordingly, the CLS mullite contemplated for use in the present invention is obtained by the following process. 1 Kaolin, which has the general composition 2.0 Sio2 A1203 0.01 to 0.10 MO H2O wherein Mo represents metal oxides such as iron and titanium, is heated to a temperature of about 900 to 13000C for about one tenth to 6 hours to obtain a reactive spinel mullite type compound having a spinel to mullite mole ratio of from about 1 0 to about 1 0.5.Temperatures of from about 900 to 10500C result in the formation of a composition which is essentially 100 spinel, whereas temperatures of 1250 to 13000C result in the formation of compositions which contain up to 50 mullite. Calcination temperatures of 900 to 12000C result in the preferred spinel mullite composition in which the spinel phase comprises 50 to 100 mole percent of the composition and the mullite phase comprises 0 to 50 mole percent. 2 The reactive spinel mullite obtained in step 1 is then combined with an alkali metal hydroxide solution, preferably sodium hydroxide solution in amounts which provide a spinel mullite NaOH H2 0 reaction mixture having the following weight ratio ranges 50 to 100 g spinel mullite 1.0 to 60 g NaOH 65 to 1000 g H2O. 3 The reaction mixture of step 2 is then heated at a temperature of about 50 to 100 go for a period of one quarter to 6 hours to extract leach from about 5 to 75 weight percent of the silica from the spinel as soluble sodium silicate. 4 Subsequent to heating in step 3 , the caustic leached spinel CLS mullite is recovered by filtration and is washed with water and exchanged with mineral acids, ammonium or rare earth salts to remove Na and obtain a finely divided particulateCLS mullite which has a silica to alumina mole ratio of from about 0.50 to l.7, a nitrogen pore volume of 0.25 to 0.70, and an average pore diameter of from 50 to 100 AO, and an x ray diffraction pattern very similar to gamma alumina. Depending on the time and temperature of the initial calcination, varying amounts, i.e. 0 to 100 and preferably 0 to 50 , of the spinel may be converted to mullite, as determined by crystalographicX ray diffraction analysis. As long as the calcination conditions i.e. time, temperature are such that the silica removed from the structure does not crystallize, a high surface area product which contains less than 0.20 Na2O is prepared. Since mullite is formed and decomposes at a higher temperature than the spinel phase, substantial conversion, ie. 10 to 50 , to mullite would be advantageous for use under severe process conditions. To determine whether the CLS mullite possesses the desired acid site concentration, a sample of CLS is subjected to temperature programmed desorption, using tertiary butyl amine, which is described as follows. About 100 mg of catalyst is pretreated at 3800C in flowing helium He 110 cc min. for one and one half hours. After cooling to room temperature in flowingHe, the catalyst is exposed to a He carrier stream 80 cc min. which passes through a tertiary butyl ammonium TBA saturator maintained at ice water temperature until breakthrough of TBA is detected by a thermal conductivity TC cell. Excess TBA is then swept from the catalyst surface in flowing He and is assumed to be eluted when the TC response returns to baseline about 5 minutes . The catalyst is then heated using a 120C min. rate to 3800C in a flow of He 80 cc min. . The resulting chromatogram consists of two 2 desorption peaks a low temperature alpha peak associated with physisorbed TBA, and a high temperature beta peak associated with chemisorbedTBA. The area of the beta peak is a measure of the amount of strong acidity the temperature of the beta peak maximum is an index of acid site strength.Planimetered beta peak areas, corrected to a dry basis using loss on ignition at 9540C, were employed in the calculation of total strong acidity and acid site density. To establish the resistance to hydrothermal degradation of the acid site content, i.e. stability, samples of CLS mullite are typically heated to a temperature of 732 to 8430C in the presence of saturated steam for a period of 5 to 12 hours. The acid site concentration is determined both prior and subsequent to hydrothermal deactivation, and it is found that the preferred CLS mullite used in the practice of the present invention will retain at least about 70 percent of the acid sites, and preferably from about 70 to 95 percent of the initial acid sites. As indicated above, the CLS mullite of the present invention is advantageously used in the preparation of hydrocarbon conversion catalysts and catalyst supports. In a preferred practice of the invention, the CLS mullite is included as a component of fluid cracking catalysts FCC which comprises a zeolite such as type Y faujasite or ZSM zeolite, an inorganic oxide binder, such as silica alumina, silica alumina sols and hydrogels, the preparation of which are generally described in the following patents U.S.3,957,689, U.S. 3,912,619, U.S. 3,650,988r U.S.4,144,194, and Canadian 967,136. Zeolites which may be included in the catalyst compositions are described in U.S. 3,293,192, 3,449r070, 3,402,996, 3,607,043, 3,676,368, 3,639,099, 3,808,326 and 4,164,551. The techniques described in the aforesaid patents may be used in the preparation of catalysts including cracking catalysts which contain the CLS mullite of the present invention. In a particularly preferred catalyst, the CLS mullite is combined with a rare earth exchanged type Y zeolite, an alumina sol binder, and from about 20 to 80 parts by weight kaolin clay.Using the technique described in Canadian patent 967,136, catalysts which contain from about 5 to 50 weight percent zeolite, from about 10 to 20 percent alumina sol binder, from about 5 to 80 percent by weight CLS mullite, from about 0 to 80 percent by weight kaolin clay are found to be particularly effective for the conversion of residual type hydrocarbons which contain substantial quantities of nickel and vanadium sulfur and or nitrogen. In addition to using the CLS mullite contemplated herein as a component for fluid cracking catalysts, it is also contemplated that the CLS mullite may be formed into particles having a desired shape and size which are useful for the preparation of hydroprocessing catalysts. Typically, the CLS mullite is formed using conventional extrusion, pilling, granulation, or sphere forming techniques. The hydroprocessing catalyst supports obtained using the CLS mullite either alone or in combination with alumina and or silica alumina sols and gels, typically will possess the following characteristics a surface area of 150 to 350 g mÃª a total pore volume 0.30 to 1.00 cc g a pore volume distribution wherein 0 to 0.1 cc g is pores less than 20 A0 in diameter, 0.20 to 0.60 cc g in pores less than 100 A in diameter, 0.05 to 0.20 cc g in pores from 100 to 1000 AO in diameter, and 0.10 to 0.50 cc g in pores greater than 1000 AO in diameter. The formedCLS mullite comprising particles may have particle size ranging from about 0.5 to 10 mm. In a particularly preferred form, the CLS mullite is formed into spheres having a size as small as 0.5 to a size as large as 4 mm. The hydroprocessing catalysts which may be obtained using the CLS mullite supports of the present invention typically contain promoter metals selected from Group VI and Group VIII of the Periodic Table.In particular, it is found that metals such as cobalt, moly, nickel and tungsten, which are incorporated in the catalyst in amounts ranging from 0.5 to as much as 20 percent by weight are particularly effective for the hydroprocessing of residual type hydrocarbon feedstocks. Typically, these feedstocks, which contain substantial quantities of nickel and vanadia as well as sulfur and nitrogen, may be demetallized, desulfurized and or denitrogenized using the catalysts contemplated herein. Conventional techniques for demetallization as well as desulfurization and denitrogenation involve treatment of the feedstock with hydrogen at pressure of 10 to 700 atm and temperatures of 300 to 6000C in the presence of the catalyst described herein. Having described the basic aspects of the present invention, the following examples are given to illustrate specific embodiments thereof. Example 1 This example shows that the starting kaolin must be calcined under conditions such that the 17500F exotherm observed in a DTA differential thermal analysis of kaolin is substantially reduced or eliminated. Samples of kaolin clay were heat treated for the time and temperature indicated in Table I.The samples were then aged at 1000C under reflux or in sealed teflon bottles for the indicated time using different levels of NaOH. Calcined samples which still exhibited a substantial exotherm at about 17500F were not reactive as indicated by the low surface areas. The conversion of metakaolin to the spinel like phase occurs fairly slowly at 17000F about 2 hours or more , but is quite rapid about 5 minutes at 20000F. Surface area of the caustic leached product is also dependent on caustic level, with increasing caustic level giving greater SiO2 removal and hence increased surface areas.

Kaolin clay was calcined for 1 hour at 18000F and then added to sodium hydroxide solutions at weight ratios given in Table II. After 2 hours of boiling under reflux the slurries were filtered and then washed on the filter twice with 5 g hot deionized water per g of starting clay. Thirty g of each of these products was then exchanged 3 times with 15 g ammonium sulfate in 300 g water. After each exchange the product was washed with hot deionized water, and oven dried. As shown by the data, even the lower surface area materials have substantial cracking activity after hydrothermal deactivation.

Example 3 This example shows that sodium Na2O can be substantially eliminated from the caustic leached spinel by reaction with dilute sulfuric acid without substantial loss in alumina content of the product.250 g of kaolin clay calcined 1 hour at 180001 was added to 675 ml H2 0 containing 157 g NaOH and boiled one half hour under reflux. The slurry was filtered and the caustic leached product was washed with hot deionized H20. After this wash the filter cake has about 4.5 5.5 Na2O and 76 weight Al203. Samples of the above filter cake, equivalent to 50 g of the original calcined clay were reslurried in 200 ml solution of varying H2SO4 concentration for one half hour at approximately 1500F, filtered and washed with hot deionized H20. The data in TableIII indicate that most of the Na2 0 can be removed without substantial loss in the A1203 content of the caustic leached product.

The data in Table IV indicates the caustic leached spinel, prepared as described below, loses little or no catalytic activity after a two hour 18000F thermal treatment or a 15500F, 5 hour, 100 steam deactivation.It is noted for comparative purposes that an all synthetic 25 Awl203 silica alumina cracking catalyst has a typical MA of about 27 after a 2 hour, 18000F thermal treatment. This sample was prepared by addition of 600 g kaolin clay calcined 1 hour at 18000F to a solution of 376.8 g NaOH in 1.62 liters deionizedH2O. After boiling 1 hour under reflux, the caustic leached spinel was filtered, and washed 3 times with 1.0 liters hot deionized H2O. The filter cake was redispersed in 2.5 liters lM H2SO4, filtered, washed on the filter 3 times with 2.0 liters hot deionized H20 and dried at 25001 . The dried product was crushed through a 30 mesh screen and then given the indicated thermal or hydrothermal treatments.

Example 5 This example shows that commercially calcined clays which do not have a significant exotherm at about 17500F as measured by DTA are useful for producing the caustic leached spinel. Table V summarizes data on caustic leaching of various commercially available calcined kaolin clays. For all three samples, leaching with caustic increased alumina content from about 42 to about 70 , and loss of silica from the structure increased the surface area to greater than 300 m2 g. It is believed that these clays are calcined at approximately 19000F for about 10 minutes.

Example 6 This example shows that reflux time can be very brief. 200 g kaolin clay calcined 1 hour at 18000F was added to 540 ml H2O containing 125.6 g NaOH and 400 g of the same material also added to 1,080 mlH20 containing 201.0 g NaOH. The slurries were boiled under reflux with portions removed after the indicated time at reflux. After filtering and washing, these samples were exchanged to low Na2O with 3 exchanges at 1500F using 20 g NE4 2SOo per 50 g clay starting material in 250 ml hot D.I. h2O. After each exchange the product was washed 1 time with 250 ml hot D.I. H20 and 3X after the third exchange. The results, given in Table IX, indicate very good catalytic cracking activities even at very short reflux times.

Example 7 This example shows the surface properties of the caustic leached spinel powder. The caustic leached spinel was prepared by adding 100 g kaolin clay calcined 1 hour at l800 F to 196 ml solution containing 50.4 g potassium hydroxide and hot aging 2 hours in a sealed teflon bottle.

The product was washed 1 time with 1 liter hot deionized H2O after the first and second exchanges, and 3 times with 1.0 liters after the third exchange to remove residual salts.

Example 8 This example describes the use of the caustic leached spinel as an additive to SiO2 sol bound catalysts as disclosed in U.S. 3,867,308. 11,250 g of kaolin was added to a solution of 7,065 g NaOR in 30 liters H2O. The slurry was boiled one hour, filtered, washed twice with 10 gallons hot H2O.After oven drying the solid was reslurried in 30 1 0.50M H2S04 for one quarter hour at 150 F, filtered, washed twice with 10 gallons hot H2O, redispersed in 20 gallons hot H2o, refiltered and oven dried 750 g dry basis of the above and 90Q g 5iQ2 A1203 basis Na Y were dispersed in the minimum H2 in a blender, the pH adjusted to 4.0 using mixed B2SO alum solution and this slurry added to a slurry of 25.3 lbs. pH 3.0 SiO2 sol about 10 SiO2 and 2200 g dry basis kaolin clay.After mixing the two slurries, the product was spray dried immediately. Example 9 This example describes the use of the caustic leached spinel as an additive to alumina sol bound catalysts. 600 g of low Na2O about 0.3 wt. calcined rare earth Y zeolite, 650 g of the caustic leached spinel made in a similar manner to that in example 17 were blended together and added to 2,128 g of aluminum chlorhydroxide 23.58 Al203 and 2,300 g dry basis kaolin clay as described in Canadian 967,136. The slurry was spray dried and the product calcined 1 hour at 10000F. This product had good physical properties Average Bulk Density CD 0.76 0.81, Davison Index Jersey Index 21 1.8 , and excellent cracking activity 84.1 versus 67.8 for standard commercial catalyst . Example 10 This example shows that when the caustic leached spinel product is reslurried in acidic media, gelation can be brought about by addition of a base. Though gelation does not change the pore structure or cracking activity, it does produce a highly porous gel which filters and washes readily so that soluble salts can be readily removed. Many of the finer caustic leached spinels become peptized and difficult to filter upon reslurrying in acid due to slow filtration or they pass through filter paper. 11,250 g of kaolin was added to 30 1 H2O containing 7,065 g NaOH and boiled 1 hour at constant volume. After filtering and washing twice with 10 gallons hot H20r the filter cake was reslurried in 30 1 0.75M H2SO4. A portion was filtered and virtually all the product went through the filter paper.A separate portion of this slurry was treated with 30 NH4OH to pH 9.5, was filtered and then washed with hot H2O. This product had a surface area of 310 mÃª g, Al2O3 of 69.84, SO4 of 0.23 and Na2O of 0.12. This sample had a microactivity of 60.9 at 93001 , 16 WeightHour Space Velocity, 3 C O after an 8 hour, 1350 F, 100 steam treatment. Example 11 This example shows that the caustic leached spinel has substantial ability to resist deactivation by metals. 500 g kaolin clay was calcined 1 hour at 180001 , boiled under reflux for 1 and one quarter hours in 1.35 1 H20 containing 314 g NaOH, filtered, and washed twice with 1.5 1 hot H2o. The product was reslurried in 2 1 0.5M H2SO4 for one half hour at l500F, filtered, washed 3 times with one 1 hotH2O, reslurried in one 1 pH 9.0 H2O adjusted with 14 NH3 for one half hour, filtered and washed twice with 2 1 hot H2O. There samples of the above product were calcined, impregnated with Ni V in pentane solution and recalcined prior to steam deactivation and activity tests.The results, given in Table XIV, show substantial activity retention even at a high 1 metals level.

Example 12 This example shows that the caustic leached spinel can be produced with high surface areas at verying alumina content by changing the caustic leaching time. Separate samples of kaolin clay calcined 1 hour at 18000F were boiled for various amounts of time under reflux at 0.63 g NaOH g calcined clay 2.7 gH2O. The products were filtered, washed twice with 5 g H2O g clay, reslurried in 4 ml 0.5M H20S04 g clay for one half hour at 1500F, filtered, washed twice with 5 g H2O g clay and oven dried at 250of. The data in Table XV indicate the caustic leached spinel produced has decreasing amounts of alumina as reflux time is extended, while still maintaining much of the surface area formed after 1 hour at reflux.

These measurements were made using temperature programmed desorption with t butylamine described previously. The results indicate the CLS prepared with a short hot age time retain a greater percentage of acid sites after steaming, i.e. have greater steam stability, than do samples prepared with long reflux times. We do not know why the stability is reduced with longer hot age. However, we observe that longer aging causes readsorption of some of the silicate originally removed from the clay and this may migrate on steam deactivation resulting in blocking encapsulation of the acid sites.
