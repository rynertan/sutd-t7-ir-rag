## Description
PREPARATION OF OPTICALLY ACTIVE ALPHA SUBSTITUTED PHENYLACETIC ACIDSBackground of the Invention 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a process for preparing optically active alpha substituted phenylacetic acids from the corresponding racemic alpha substituted phenylacetonitriles. 2. Description of the Prior Art It is known that alpha substituted phenylacetic acids and derivatives thereof are themselves biologically active or are intermediates to biologically active materials, for example, in U.S. patents 3,452,079, 4,062,968 and 4,199,595. It is also known that a particular biological activity of the materials usually resides primarily in one enantiomer of the acid moiety. Accordingly, it is useful to produce only the desired enantiomer. Various methods are known to prepare alpha substituted phenylacetic acids, to resolve these acids and even to racemize these acids, which methods result in overall complex processes to obtain a desired acid enantiomer when starting from the alpha substituted phenylacetonitrile.For example,U.S. patents 4,062,968 and 4,220,592 describe hydrolysis of alphasubstituted phenylacetonitriles, U.S. patent 4,337,352 and 4,376,213 and Japanese patents 50 25,544 and 55 136,245 describe resolution of alpha substituted phenylacetic acids with amines and U.S. patent 4,245,116 describes racemization of alpha substituted phenylacetic acid by forming a racemate of the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt at above iiO0C followed by hydrolysis. The object of the present invention is to provide a new and simple process for the preparation of optically active alpha substituted phenylacetic acids from the corresponding racemic nitriles which eliminates additional steps and reagents which had heretofore been needed for the separate process to racemize the undesired optically active acid. sugary of the Invention A process for preparing a desired optically active alphasubstituted phenylacetic acid vhich comprises forming a mixture of racemic alpha substituted phenylacetonitrile and undesired opticallyactive alpha substituted phenylacetic acid moiety, treating the lix ture with a strong base in the presence of water, resolving the resulting racemic alpha substituted phenylacetic acid moiety and recovering the desired optically active alpha substituted phenylacetic acid. Preferably, the undesired optically active phenylacetic acid moiety from the resolution is recycled for forming the mixture wlth the ultrile. Thus, the present invention provides a novel and simple process in which hydrolysis of the starting material, racemic alphasubstituted phenylacetonitrile, is conducted in the presence of si sultaneous racemization of the recycled undesired form of the corresponding optically active alpha substituted phenylacetic acid. The racemic alpha substituted phenylacetic acid moiety in the hydrolysis product which is resolved is a moiety R C O O in which R is an alpha substituted phenylmethyl group and corresponds to the desired acid of the product.Usually this racemic moiety is obtained from hydrolysis as the metal alkali salt and is converted to the free racemic acid for resolution via the methods taught below, e.g. via amine salts. m the preferred form of the process of the invention, a desired optically active phenylacetic acid is prepared by forming a mixture of the corresponding racemic alpha substituted phenylacetoni trile and the corresponding undesired optically active alpha substituted phenylacetic acid or alkali metal salt thereof, treating the mixture with an alkali metal hydroxide in the presence of water, resolving the resulting raceic alpha substituted phenylacetic acid alkali metal salt by treating the salt or free acid obtained therefrom with an optically active amine, recycling the undesired optl cally active alpha substituted phenylacetic acid or alkali metal salt thereof for forming the mixture with the nitrile and recovering the desired optically active phenylacetic acid. The process is initiated by forming a mixture of a racemic alpha substituted phenylacetonitrile corresponding to the desired acid product and a corresponding undesired optically active alphasubstituted phenylacetic acid moiety and treating the mixture with a base. The bases used to treat the racemic nitrile include those bases which will hydrolyze the nitrile to the racemic acid or to a derivative thereof, which derivative can subsequently be utilized to resolve the racemic acid moiety or to give free racemic acid that can be subsequently resolved. The bases used are strong bases including alkali metal hydroxides or the like. This hydrolysis process step of the invention is conducted by initially charging a reactor vessel with a racemic alphasubstituted phenylacetonitrile and optically active alpha substituted phenylacetic acid moiety, which are treated with the base in the presence of water. While it is usually desirable to use an excess of base, the ratio of base to nitrile can be from about 2 1 to about 1 1. Preferably, an excess, e.g. 10 302 excess, of an alkali metal hydroxide is used. The temperature for the step is chosen so that hydrolysis occurs at a desired rate. While ambient temperatures and above are used, preferably this step is conducted at an elevated temperature above about 1100C at normal or elevated pressures.Preferably, this hydrolysis treatment is conducted with an alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide, at temperatures of from about 1500 to about 1900C and usefully under a positive pressure of up to about 250 psig and usually up to about 150 to about 220 psig. Most of this positive pressure is obtained from the course of the reaction itself. The reaction is conducted in the presence or absence of a usually non hydroxylic solvent. The absence of added solvent gives adequate results and the optional presence of solvents, particularly traces of hydroxylic solvent, in the stream of recycle undesired optically active alpha substituted phenylacetic acid moiety, need not be avoided. Indeed, the presence of the recycle stream improves the rate of hydrolysis of the racemic nitrile. Thus, when the recycle stream of undesired optically active alpha substituted phenylacetic acid is added to the racemic nitrile, the conditions of the combined racemic nitrile hydrolysis opticallyactive acid racemization are substantially the same as for the nitrile hydrolysis alone. The product of the process is recovered by conventional techniques known in the art or is used directly in g resolution process. In one esbodi ent, the hot mixture from hydrolysis containing an alkali metal salt of the racemic alpha substituted phenylacetic acid moiety is treated directly with an optically active primary, secondary or tertiary amine mineral acid salt which is equivalent to only one enantiomer, in an aqueous, weakly alkaline buffered solution having a pil value at which the entire acid is present in ionized form but at which no amine salt is yet deprotonated.Under such conditions the resolution is directly accomplished by the precipitation of the nomonium salt of the desired optically active alpha substituted phenylacetic acid while the other enantiomer remains in solution. The anoint of amine salt is usually at least about equtwolar to the amount of alpha substituted phenylacetic acid moiety in the mixture obtained from the nitrile hydrolysis. In this embodiment, the optically active amine salt is a mineral acid salt, including those salts of lower alkyl esters of alpha phenylglycine, phenylethylamine, phenylethanolamine, 1 phenyl 2 dimethylamino 1 ,3propanediol, abietylamine and the like.Of these, optically active alpha phenylglycine methyl or ethyl ester is preferred. Such a treatment is described in U.S. patent 4,337,352, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. In another embodiment, the hot mixture from hydrolysis is treated to recover the racemic alpha substituted phenylacetic acid and if necessary to convert it to a form suitable for resolution.For example, the hot mixture from the hydrolysis is treated with a relatively strong acid optionally in the presence of a solvent.Preferably, a mineral acid, e.g. hydrochloric, sulfuric or the like.On these, a strong acrid, such as hydrochloric acid is preferred.Usually the amount of strong acid used is at least about equtmolar to the base in the mixture from the racemic nit rile hydrolysis. When a solvent is used water, an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon or other non hydroxylic solvent such as halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, or the like can be used or mixtures of such solvents. Preferably, the solvent in the recovery and or strong acid treatment is one which will also function well in the subsequent resolution step. These include hydrocart n or non hydroxylic solvents and the like or mixtures thereof. Cycloaliphatic solvents include cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane or the like. Aromatic hydrocarbons include those containing from 6 to 10 carbons, for example, benzene, toluene, o , m or p xylene, the trimethylbenzenes, p ethyltoluene and the like.Aliphatic hydrocarbons include the lower alkanes including those containing 5 to 10 carbon atoms, for example, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane and isomeric forms thereof. The byproduct brine is removed and the organic phase containing free racemic alpha substituted phenylacetic acid is available for recovery of the free racemic alpha substituted phenylacetic acid by conventional techniques, prior to resolution, or preferably the solution of free racemic acid is used directly in the subsequent resolution. The free racemic alpha substituted phenylacetic acid recovered from the hydrolysis is resolved by conventional methods of resolving acids, including chemical and biochemical methods for resolving acids or derivatives of the acids, including the various methods, for example, described in Eliel, E., Stereochemistry ofCarbon Compounds , McGraw Hill Book Co., N.Y. 1962 . Of the various methods known in the art, the chemical methods of resolution through salt formation and selective fractional precipitation or crystallization with amines is preferred. Of these methods of using amines, resolution via conversion to diastereoisomers is usually most practical. The racemic acid is resolved into its two enantiomeric forms by salt formation with optically active chiral amines to give the diastereoisomer salts. Any optically,active amine can be used, including various acyclic, carbocyclic and heterocyclic amines, such as those specifically disclosed in Newman, P., Optical Resolution Procedures for ChemicalCompounds , Vol. 1, Amines and Related Compounds, Optical ResolutionInformation Center, Manhattan College, Riverdale, N.Y., Library ofCongress Catalog Card No. 78 61452, U.S. patents 4,337,352, and Japanese patents 50 25,544 and 55 136,245 and the like.For example, quinine, brucrne, cinchonidine, cinchonine, hydroxyhydrindamine, norphine, alpba phenyl beta phenylethylamine, alpha phenyl beta p tol yl ethylMine, phenyloxynaphthylamine, a pha 1 naphthyl ethylazine, quinidine, 1 fenchylamine, strychnine, basic amino acids, such ss lysine or arglaine, and the like.Preferably, the optically activeMine is an aryl Mine containing from 8 to 20 carbon atoms, and espectally, alpha phenyl beta p tolyl ethylamine, alpha phenyl beta phenyletbylamine or aIpha phenylethylamine. In another embodiment of the resolution, non chiral Mines are used to form a supersaturated solution of the amine salt such that the salt of one enantiomer of the alpha substituted phenylacetic acid crystallizes out. For example, in U.S. patent 4,376,213 an alpha substituted phenylacetic acid is resolved using diethylamine. The resolution with chiral or non chiral amines is conducted by treating the racemic alpha substituted phenylacetic acid with an Mine capable of forming a salt with one enantiomer of the racemic alpha substituted phenylacetic acid, usually in an inert solvent from which the desired diastereolsomer amine salt of the acid preferentially is recoverable, e.g. by precipitation, crystallization, chro matography or the like. For best results, the differential solubilities of the amine salts of the two optically active enantiomeric forms of the acid in the solvent should be high. For example, the organic phase containing free racemic alpha substituted phenylacetic acid is treated with the amine, usually in the presence of a solvent.The resulting mixture is usually heated, e.g. to reflux, followed by cooling until one of the diastereoisomer salts preferentially crystallizes or precipitates. The solvent when used in resolution, precipitation or crys tallization, is one from which the desired diasterisomer amine salt preferential crystallizes froa and is usually water, a hydroxylic or an aliphatic, aromatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon solvent. Suitable hydroxylic solvents include lower alkanols containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms1 such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol and the like. Of these, methanol or ethanol are preferred. Hydrocarbon solvents include those previously described above. Preferably the solvent is an alkanol or aromatic hydrocarbon. Of these, methanol or toluene or a mixture thereof is preferred. The precipitation of the amine salt of the optically active alpha substituted phenylacetic acid is conducted with or without the addition of seed crystals of the amine salt of the desired opticallyactive phenylacetic acid. While it is usually desirable that essentially equimolar amounts of racemic alpha substituted phenylacetic acid and amine are used, variations of from about 1 2 to about 2 1 are used. The temperature for this resolution step is chosen so that it is not high enough to cause decomposition of the amine salt but at which precipitation will occur. This varies depending on the particular salt, but is usually within ambient temperatures.Initially, it can be useful to heat a solution of the racemic acid and the amine to aid in salt formation and form a saturated solution at from about 5Oo to about 15O0C. The solution is then cooled to ambient temperatures for precipitation. Precipitation proceeds normally over a period of time of up to several days. Use of lower temperatures, stirring and or seed crystals are factors which can be used to reduce the time. The separation and recovery of the precipitated solid or crystalline product amine salt of the optically active alpha substituted phenylacetic acid from the mother liquor is achieved by conventional methods known in the art, such as filtration, or centrifugation and decantation of the mother liquor. Then, the resulting solids are usually washed with a solvent to remove any clinging mother liquor and, if desired, the salt is decomposed, e.g. with a strong acid, to recover the desired optically active alpha substituted phenylacetic acid in the solvent phase. The solvent phase containing the desired optically active acid moiety may be used directly as a product or the optically active phenylacetic acid is recovered after removal of the solvent, e.g. by distillation, evaporation or the like. The mother liquor from the resolution, e.g. precipitation, containing the undesired optically active alpha substituted phenylacetic acid moiety, usually as the amine salt, is treated to recover the undesired optically active acid moiety for recycle, e.g. by converting the amine salt back to the free acid or directly to its alkali metal salt. Usually, the mother liquor, optionally combined with wash solvent from washing the amine salt of the desired opticallyactive acid, is treated to decompose the amine salt and obtain free undesired optically active alpha substituted phenylacetic acid for recycle. For example, the mother liquor, optionally with the wash, are frsetiouated and the bottoms treated to decompose the amine salt, e.g. with aqueous solution of a strong acid.The resulting organic phase containing the free undesired optically active alpha substituted phanylacetic acid is recycled and treated with an alkali metal hydroxide to form the metal salt prior to charging to the vessel containing the racemic alpha substituted phenylacetonitrile, e.g. by wash treatment treatment with aqueous solution of such metal compound, or is converted to the metal salt within the hydrolysis racemization vessel containing the nitrile by using a high excess of charged base.In another embodiment, the Mine salt of the undesired optically active acid is treated at ambient temperature with an alkali metal hydroxide, e.g. aqueous sodium hydroxide, to form the corresponding metal salt for direct recycle of the aqueous metal salt solution, option ally in the presence of any solvent remaining from the resolution.Metal salt formation usually takes place at about ambient tempera tures or higher, e.g. from about f00 1900C and preferably from about 150O0C. The hydrolysis racemization process of the invention is conducted as a continuous, semi continuous or batch process. Recov ery andirecycle of reagents, such as solvents, resolving agents, acidic and basic treatment streams and the like are conventional and can be varied as kncsm in the art to meet particular location needs and facilities. While an initial advantage of the present process is its simplicity by providing a means of simultaneously conducting racemic nitrile hydrolysis and by product undesired optically active acid moiety racemization, other advantages are obtained. In particular, the hydrolysis rate is improved when conducted in the presence of the recycle acid stream and is not adversely effected by the presence of hydroxylic solvents in the recycle which might be expected to have lead to reaction products between free acid formed in the hydrolysis and the hydroxylic solvents.Lower pressures are obtained in the combined hydrolysisXracemization of the present invention as compared to even conducting the hydrolysis and the racemization as separate Steps and therefore higher temperatures can be used in the combined hydrolysis resulting in shorter reaction times. Optically active alpha substituted phenylacetic acids which are prepared by the process of the present invention are conventional materials generally known in the art, for example, as in U.S. patents 3,452,079, 4,062,968, 4,199,595, 4,376,213 and the like. Opticallyactive alpha substituted phenylacetic acids often have biological activity themselves or are intermediates to useful derivatives, such as salts and esters, which have biological activity as, e.g. pesticides and pharmaceuticals. Optically active alpha substituted phenylacetic acids are also useful for resolving racemic amines into their enantiomers by classical resolution of the resulting amine salts. Illustrative of the optically active alpha substituted phenylacetic acids which are prepared by the process of the present invention include those of formula IEMI9.1 wherein R is an alkyl or cycloalkyl group containing up to 6 carbon atoms each X and Y independently is a hydrogen atom a halogen atom an alkyl group or an alkoxy group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms each optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms having an atomic number of from 9 to 35 and each m and n is an integer of 1 to 5, provided that the sum of m n does not exceed 5, or X and Y when taken together form a methylenedioxy group. In one embodiment of the invention, the optically active alpha substituted phenylacetic acids are those of formula I in whichR is isopropyl or cyclopropyl each X and Y independently is halogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy or haloalkoxy in which any halogen is fluorine, bromine or chlorine and the alkyl contains 1 to 4 carbon atoms and each m and n is 0 or 1. For example, in formula I, R is isopropyl, m is 0 and n is 1 and Y is halogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy or haloalkoxy, preferably in the para position, including optically active alpha isopropyl p chlorophenylacetic, alpha isopropylp difluoromethoxyacetic, alpha isopropyl p tert butyl phenylacetic acid and the like.
