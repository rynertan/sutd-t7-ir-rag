# Method for repairing metal in an article.

## Abstract
In the repair of a metallic article portion, a metal powder and laser beam are applied concurrently, the laser beam being applied in a power density range of 10⁴ to 10⁶ watts per square centimeter at an interaction time between the laser and the article and powder of 0.005 2 seconds to generate a repair layer. Apparatus for delivering a consistent, con tinuous flow of powder comprises the combination of an enclosed powder reservoir 40 including means 44 to introduce a gas under pressure, a mechanical means 50 to feed powder into a conduit 54 , a conduit vibrating means 52 , and a fluid cooled powder delivery nozzle 56 .
