## Description
This invention relates to pattern data processing apparatus. Apparatus embodying the invention may, for example, be incorporated in integrated services of a digital network a so called Information Network System for displaying desired graphics patterns on a monitor image display based on data transmitted via a digital communication line. When it is desired to display a graphics pattern based on pattern information such as vertex information relating to a polygon transmitted via a digital communication line, and to shade an internal portion of the pattern, it is necessary to detect a closed area in the pattern. Two processes are known for detecting such a closed area. The first process requires a memory for storing all information on the shape of a given graphics pattern. The second process needs no memory and searches for a closed area based on information as to the intersections of a given pattern. With the first process, since information on the closed area is stored in the memory, the process can employ various types of shading shading over the full surface, vertical hatching, horizontal hatching, cross hatching, slant hatching and various processing directions downward, rightward, etc . However, the memory is required to have quite a large capacity as it has to store all the pattern information given. According to the second process, received vertex information items are sequentially connected to find a straight line, and then an intersection of the straight line and a scanning direction, and the closed area is shaded using the intersection information. Although the second process requires no memory, a program for performing the process is complex and the time required for effecting the process is long. Since complicated processing such as crosshatching is difficult to achieve, the types of processing that can be accomplished are limited. An article entitled The Edge Flag Algorithm A Fill Method for Raster Scan Displays by B D Ackland et al, appearing in IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS, Vol. C 30, No. 1, January 1981, New York, USA, discloses a pattern data processing apparatus for processing pattern data, based on which a predetermined pattern is displayed in a display area, the pattern data including data corresponding to both the display area and a data calculating area outside of the display area, and the display area being divided into a plurality of pixels, the pattern data processing apparatus comprising The present invention provides a pattern data processing apparatus as just set forth, the apparatus being characterised in that A preferred pattern data processing apparatus embodying the invention and described hereinbelow is capable of detecting a closed area with a memory of small capacity, is capable of coping with various methods of processing a closed area and of processing the closed area in a short period of time, and can properly determine a shaded area. The invention will now be further described, by way of illustrative and non limiting example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows the overall arrangement of a pattern data processing apparatus embodying the present invention. The pattern data processing apparatus includes data buffers 1, 2 for storing received data, a flag data memory 3, and a processor 4 comprising a microcomputer. In this embodiment of the present invention, a language called PDI The processor 4 generates flags described later using the data stored in the data buffers 1, 2 and writes the flags into the flag memory 3. The processor 4 also reads the flags out of the flag memory 3 and writes desired picture data from the processor 4 into a raster memory 5 at predetermined addresses therein. The raster memory 5 has a memory area corresponding to a display area one frame, for example . The picture data as read out of the raster memory 5 is supplied through a display control circuit 6 to a monitor display 7. The raster memory 5 is scanned in synchronism with beam scanning in the monitor display 7. As shown in Figure 2, the flag memory 3 has a memory area corresponding to the display area and composed of horizontal X pixels and vertical Y pixels and outer frames 8A, 8B, 8C and 8D added respectively to four sides of the area and each having a width equal to that of one pixel. The display area corresponds to an entire screen, or a portion thereof, of the monitor display 7. The flag memory 3 also comprises a data calculating area which is composed of an area obtained by removing the display area from an area having a size determined by bit numbers in a two dimensional plane. By the way of example, the data calculating area and the display area may jointly form four frames. For reducing necessary calculations, a closed area is detected and processed with a logic pixel composed of a plurality of physical pixels that are handled as a unit. Flags are generated in the display area and in the data calculating area, respectively. As illustrated in Figure 3, the contour of a closed area 9 and a straight line 10 intersect each other at an odd number of points. Assuming that the straight line 10 is indicative of a processing direction, therefore, a shading process is effected from the first intersection point to the next intersection point, and no shading is performed between that next intersection point and the next succeeding intersection point since the closed area 9 is not interposed between the points. Then, the areas sandwiched between two adjacent intersection points are alternately shaded. The detection of a closed area will be described with reference to an example in which vertex data in received data indicates a polygon. A prescribed initial flag expressed by 0 is set in each of the pixels of the flag memory 3. Then, one straight line constituting a contour of the polygon is calculated from the received data. Whether a plurality of pixels corresponding to the calculated straight line are contained in a display area is determined. Thereafter, prescribed flags different from the initial flags are written in addresses corresponding to the pixels that are contained in the display area. The flags related to the pixels contained in the display area are composed of a plurality of bits having first, second, and third items of identifying information, as described hereinbelow. The pixels outside of the display area, that is, pixels contained in the data calculating area, are successively mapped into the outer frames 8A to 8D. As shown in Figure 4, a straight line contained in an area 11A having a width X and extending vertically upwardly in the data calculating area is mapped into the outer frame 8A, a straight line contained in an area 11B having the width X and extending vertically downwardly is mapped into the outer frame 8B, a straight line contained in an area 11C having a width Y and extending horizontally in one direction is mapped into the outer frame 8C, and a straight line contained in an area 11D having the width Y and extending horizontally in the opposite direction is mapped into the outer frame 8D. The flags written in the outer frames 8A to 8D are each in the form of one bit which is either in an initial state expressed as 0 or in a set state expressed as 1 . When they are mapped, they are in a state different from that prior to mapping. Accordingly, when odd straight lines are contained in each of the areas 11A to 11D, the flags become 1 as a result of successive mapping. Conversely, when even straight lines are contained in each of the areas 11A to 11D, the flag become 0 as a result of successive mapping. A process for mapping singular points contained in the areas 11A to 11D will now be described with reference to Figure 5. The mapping is to be performed in a horizontal direction in Figure 5. A singular point Pa comprising a vertex where two oppositely slanting straight lines intersect will not be mapped. Singular points Pb, Pc comprising intersections of two oppositely slanting straight lines and a horizontal line will not be mapped with the points interconnected and regarded as the same as the singular point Pa. Singular points Pd, Pe comprising intersections of two similarly slanting straight lines and a horizontal line will be mapped with the points interconnected and regarded as the same as a singular point Pf. The foregoing processing operation for singular points is basically the same in the display area and the data calculating area. Whether a point is a singular point or not can be determined by checking address information on successive pixels for a straight line sought to be processed. Each of the straight lines of a polygon contained in the areas 11A to 11D of the data calculating area is mapped into the outer frames 8A to 8D. The outer frames 8A to 8D and the display area flag memory 3 are scanned in a predetermined direction and sequence to read the flags. The areas between the flags in the set state are alternately shaded. The type and direction of shading, and whether the shading should contain the contour line, are determined by the received data. A specific example, wherein flags are generated when received data is representative of a polygon, will now be described with reference to Figure 6. When a given polygon extends over a display area and a data calculating area, as illustrated in Figure 6, flags are generated as shown in Figure 6B for the pixels in the memory area and the outer frames 8A to 8D in the flag memory 3. The flags in the initial state are omitted from the illustration given in Figure 6B. A flag indicated by 2 in the flag memory 3 is indicative of a singular point same as the singular point Pa in Figure 5 . Since a point P‚ÇÅ in Figure 6A corresponds to the singular point Pa, the flag at the corresponding address in the outer frame 8C is 0 as illustrated in Figure 6B. Three points P‚ÇÇ, P‚ÇÉ, P‚ÇÑ in the same horizontal position are successively mapped into the corresponding addresses in the outer frame 8C. As a result, the flags at these addresses are 1 , as shown in Figure 6B. The flag corresponding to a singular point P‚ÇÖ in the display area is 2 . Since no polygonal straight line is present in the area 11A, the flags in the outer frame 8A are all 0 . The flags in the outer frame 8B are all 1 as there is a straight line extending throughout the outer area 11B. Pixels can be shaded vertically, horizontally, or obliquely by using the flags in the outer frames 8A to 8D and the flag memory 3. More specifically, the shading process is started from a flag 1 of the flags in the outer frames 8A to 8D, and the pixels sandwiched between the flags 1 are alternately shaded such that a pixel or pixels positioned up to the next flag 1 will not be shaded. Such shading processing is performed by the processor 4, which receives the flags read out of the flag memory 3 and writes processed picture data into addresses in the raster memory 5 based on the received flags. Shading processing for a circular or arcuate pattern will now be described. When a circle is to be processed, two pieces of vertex data and a picture description command indicative of a circle are received. The receiving means determines data on a circle, with the two vertex data serving as a diameter, through calculations. When an arc is to be processed, three pieces of vertex data and a picture description command indicative of an arc are received. The receiving means then determines data on an arc. The arcuate pattern can be formed by shading the data on the arc. A circle intersects a straight line at two points at most. Based on this property, where circle portions are displaced off the display area, flags may be set at all times in the corresponding frames. Figure 7 illustrates, by way of example, the flags set when displaying a shaded quarter of a circle. With the above described arrangement, a closed area can be detected and flags can be generated for shading the closed area by employing a memory having a size corresponding to a display area or a combination of a display area and outer frames each having a width equal to that of a pixel. Since all flags for shading a closed area in a given graphics pattern are written in the memory, various types of shading can be carried out and the time required for pattern data processing can be shortened. A flag corresponding to each logic pixel in the display area has an amount of information necessary for shading the closed area in the given pattern, so that the closed area can be shaded accurately and easily. With the flags for shading the closed area being written in the memory, it is possible to perform various types of shading as compared with a process which determines whether an area is to be shaded successively on the basis of intersection information. According to the above described arrangement, the contour of a graphics pattern can be drawn, and it is possible to effect hatching or crosshatching with horizontal and vertical lines and shading in a horizontal or vertical direction by using contour information.
