# Process for forming a dense thin sintered layer.

## Abstract
A process for forming a thin dense coated layer on a substrate comprises carrying out a one or more preliminary coating operations com prising the steps of applying a paste, comprising a powder ed sinterable material dispersed in an organic vehicle, to the substrate by screen printing and drying and calcining or sintering the applied paste followed by b a final coating operation carrying out the steps of applying a paste, as in step s a , to the coated substrate by screen printing, and drying and sintering the applied paste under sintering conditions. The process may be used, for example, to apply layers of insulating material, dielectric material or, especially solid oxygen ion conductive electrolytes to appropriate substrates. The calcination or sintering in the preliminary coating operation s is preferably carried out at a tem perature from 0.4 to 0.8 times the sintering temperature in the final coating operation and the powder employed in the final operation preferably has a particle size not more than 0.9 times that of the powder employed in the prelimi nary operation s .
