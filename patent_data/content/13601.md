# Variable flow control valve.

## Abstract
A flow control valve comprises a closure member 2 having a fluid passage there through and a flow control device 6 disposed in the passage of the closure member which protrudes therefrom and which provides a variable degree of restriction dependent upon the degree to which the valve is opened. The closure member in combination with the flow control device provides an optimal restriction in the full range of valve settings with decreasing restriction as the valve is opened so that at the fully open position the flow control device does not significantly restrict the flow of fluid.
