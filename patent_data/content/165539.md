# Virtual vector registers for vector processing system.

## Abstract
A working or buffer store 61, 62 is connected between a main or bulk store 74 and a vector processing unit 50 . The buffer store contains one or more virtual vector registers operable under user control in register to register RR vector operations. A user instruction specifies the length of a vector operand to be processed, the type of operation to be performed, and which vector registers will be used. Vector processing is controlled by a series of programs 106 defined at the code level of the processing unit where for a given function or operation, the same program is used for both register to register and storage to storage processing. The latter processing is controlled by passing predetermined parameters to the program whereas register to register processing is controlled by passing parameters generated in response to user program instructions.
