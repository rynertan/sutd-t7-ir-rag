Preparation of Cefoxitin Lithium Salt To a stirred suspension of 42.75 g O.lm of cefoxitin in 1 liter of water is added at 0 5 over a period of 45 60 minutes a solution of 0.1N lithium hydroxide. The initial pH of the mixture is about 3.0. Addition of the alkaline solution is so regulated that the pH does not rise above 5.5. The solution, about 2.5 liters, is filtered to remove a small amount of undissolved free acid and then subdivided in equal portions into 5 x 5 liter round bottom flasks for lyophilization and for use in the next steps.Step B. Esterification Fifty four grams 0.125 m of cefoxitin Li salt is charged into a 3 liter, 3 necked round bottom flask, fitted with a stirrer and Drierite tube. The solid is stirred and 540 ml of hexamethylphosphoramide HMPA , pH 6.7, is added. Upon the addition of 5 methyl 2 oxo 1,3 dioxolen 4 yl methyl bromide, 0.25 m , the temperature rises slightly, and is kept at about room temperature, while stirring 20 minutes.Esterification is monitored by tlc silica gel plates, ethylacetate chloroform solvent . After the end of the reaction period, the solution is added to a stirred mixture of 5 liters of water and 5 liters of ethyl acetate. The separated aqueous phase is extracted with 2 x 2 liters of ethyl acetate, and the combined solution is washed with 2 x 2 liters of water and 1 x 2 liters of saturated sodium chloride solution. The solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, treated with 15 g ofDarco G 60, and after filtration, concentrated under vacuum at room temperature. The concentrate is dissolved in 270 ml of methylene chloride, and the resulting solution added slowly to 13 liters of petroleum benzin with rapid stirring. The precipitate is filtered off, washed with petroleum benzin and dried at r.t. 0.lmm 18 hrs. P2O5. Step C. Purification The above impure ester is dissolved in 400 ml of ethyl acetate at room temperature. The solution is treated with 2 x 7.0 g of Darco G 60, washing the charcoal cake well after each treatment with ethyl acetate. The combined filtrate and washes are concentrated at room temperature at 2 5 mm to a volume of about 500 ml. To the stirred concentrated solution under anhydrous conditions is added slowly 700 ml of ethyl ether to the point of producing a first permanent cloudiness. The solution is clarified with a few drops of ethyl acetate and then ether ca 5 ml is carefully added to cloudiness again. After stirring for a few minutes, the solution is allowed to stand undisturbed at room temperature for 3 4 hours, and then aged at 50 overnight. The mixture is filtered, and the solid washed with 3 x 50 ml of ether.The cefoxitin ester is dried at r.t. 0.l mm P205 24 hours. Alternatively, the silver salt of cefoxitin can be prepared by reacting 1 equivalent of cefoxitin free acid with 1 equivalent sodium bicarbonate in water then adding the resulting solution to a solution of 2 equivalents of silver nitrate in aqueous solution. The silver salt precipitates, is dried and used as the starting material in reaction with the 5 methyl 2 oxo 1,3 dioxolen 4 yl methyl bromide, as described above, as a suspension in anhydrous acetonitr ile. The final product, 5 methyl 2 oxo 1,3dioxolen 4 yl methyl ester of cefoxitin can be administered to humans at the usual dosage levels and regimen as cefoxitin sodium, a widely available product. The product can be given IV or orally, at levels of 2 20 mg kg day. Blood levels of drug are enhanced in comparison with cefoxitin sodium. Other Pharmaceutical Products Many other antibiotics and antibacterials can have enhanced blood levels, if they are employed in the form of the 5 alkyl 2 oxo 1,3 dioxolen4 yl methyl ester. The ester form of these compounds is prepared using the same general procedure described above for the cefoxitin ester. In addition, any therapeutic pharmaceutical, if it posseses a carboxylic acid group can be used in the 5 methyl 2 oxo 1,3dioxolen 4 yl methyl ester form, to yield enhanced absorption and higher blood levels.

Other compounds can be used. All of the above compounds are known in the art in the acid or sodium salt form. Their dosage form, dosage regimen and indications as the 5 methyl 2 oxo 1,3 dioxolen4 yl methyl ester is the same as the free acid or pharmaceutically accepted salt or ester forms already published. The advantage of the ester group yields enhanced blood levels of the active compound in the human or animal being treated. Another group of compounds which can be employed to form the ester are those disclosed in U.S.4,146,719, a group of quinoline carboxylic acids. One particularly preferred compound in this patent is 1 ethyl 6 fluoro 1,4 dihydro 4 oxo 7 1 piperazinyl 3 quinoline carboxylic acid. The ester forms are employed in the same dosage form and regimen as inU.S. 4,146,719, which is incorporated by reference.An example teaching how to make the 5 methyl 1,3dioxol 4 en 2 on 4 yl methyl ester of the compound l ethyl 6 fluoro 1,4 dihydro 4 oxo 7 1 piperazinyl 3 quinoline carboxylic acid follows. It is noted that the nitrogen on the quinoline ring is first blocked using a trimethyl silyl blocking group, although any similar blocking group can be employed. This blocking group is then displaced with 2 trimethylsilylethoxycarbonyl chloride, the ester group formed, and the blocking group removed by trifluoroacetic acid. Other similar blocking and unblocking steps can be employed to yield the desired ester. A similar procedure is used to prepare the 5 t butyl 1,3 dioxol 4 en 2on 4 yl methyl ester of the compound l ethyl 6 fluoro l,4 dihydro 4 oxo 7 1 piperazinyl 3 quinoline carboxylic acid. EXAMPLE 2Step A.Preparation of l Ethyl 6 fluoro 1,4 dihydro 4 oxo 7 4 2 trimethylsilylethoxycarbonyl piperazin l yl 3 quinoline carboxylic Acid 3 .

The mixture is heated with stirring in a N2 atmosphere until refluxing begins, the heating bath is removed, and trimethylsilyl chloride, 900 , 770 mg 7.07 mmole is added in rapid dropwise fashion, with continued stirring. The suspension clears towards the end of the addition, then clouds again slightly as the last of the chloride is added. The mixture is stirred and heating to reflux resumed for 1 hour. The resultant solution of 2 is cooled in an ice bath, and triethylamine, 475 , 345 mgt 3.41 mmole , is added, followed by 2 trimethylsilylethoxycarbonyl chloride, 600 , 564 mg 3.13 mmole J.C.S. Chem. Comm., 358 1978 with continued stirring. After ice bath removal, the mix is allowed to stir for 1.5 hours, after which solvent is removed by evaporation under a N2 stream. The resultant purplish solid is slurried with 10 ml of a 5 aqueous citric acid solution, centrifuged, and the precipitate of 3 washed twice with water. The resultant paste is spread over the inside of the centrifuge tube and dried with a gentle N2 stream. In 9 1 CHC13 MeOH, the tlc shows an elongated, but relatively homogeneous spot which is significantly more mobile than 1.Chromatography on 30 g Baker silica gel with 2 MeOH CH2C12 gives after an initial 100 ml void volume a series of 8 10 ml fractions the bulk of the product appears in fractions 7 14, with traces in 6 and 15 30.

The resultant white residue is treated with 5 ml of dry hexamethylphosphoramide containing 583 mg of 4 bromo methyl 5 methyl 1,3 dioxol 4 en 2 one as an 50 mix with unbrominated material 1.9 mmole Ann. 27 1977 . Solution is aided if a small magnetic stirring bar is present to help in wiping the walls with the limited volume of liquid. After stirring for 3 hours, the solution is diluted with 50 ml petroleum ether and stirred for another half hour. The oil which separates is washed once with petroleum ether and purified by chromatography on silica gel using 1 methanol in methylene chloride.After recrystallization, an analytical sample, m.p. 1450 d , gives the following Calcd. for C27H34FN308Si C, 56.33 H, 5.95 N, 7.30.Found C, 56.11 H, 5.95 N, 7.19.
