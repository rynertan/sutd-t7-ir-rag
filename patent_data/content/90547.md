# BRAKE CONTROL SYSTEM AND CONTROL VALVE

## Abstract
A brake control for a vehicle, especially a heavy work vehicle having both service 22 and emergency 24 braking systems, comprises a manually actuable control valve 20 including a variable pressure regulating portion having an inlet 36 from a pump 14 , an outlet 44 to the service brakes 22 and a spool 34 controlling the outlet pressure to the service brakes. The control valve 20 also has a three way valve portion having an inlet 80 from the pump 14 , an outlet 86 to the emergency brake actuators 24 which are preferably the pressure release spring apply type, and an externally controlled valve stem 30 with a wide groove 92 which supplies pressure to the emergen cy brake actuators 24 continually over much of its travel. The stem 30 operates the service brake portion through a compres sion spring 68 disposed between the stem 30 and the spool 34 . Near the end of its travel, the three way valve portion switches to connect the pressure outlet 86 to the hydraulic reservoir allowing the springs to apply the emergency brakes. The control valve 20 could have other uses than the braking system taught wherein the three way valve switching occurs before the substantial stem travel portion during which the primary operation of regulating portion of the valve takes place.
