# Article having heat expandable sealing member.

## Abstract
An article comprising a generally axially extending outer, tubular member, a plurality of generally axially extending cylin drical members, and a heat expandable foam sealing member. The outer tubular member has at least one opening and occu pies a predetermined volume. Each of the cylindrical members is received by outer tubular member in an axially extending, parallel fashion such that the cylindrical members occupy a vol ume that is less than the volume of the outer tubular member. The sealing member, capable of sealing the opening of outer tubular member, occupies a volume that is generally equal to the difference between the volume of the outer tubular mem ber and the volume of the cylindrical members.
