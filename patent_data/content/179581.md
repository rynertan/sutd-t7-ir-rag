# VARIABLE VALVE TIMING MECHANISM

## Abstract
A variable valve timing mechanism uses the known principle of an eccentric drive to the camshafts 2, 3. The drive is by means of a shaft 1 which extends through the sleeves and can be moved by means of a bearing 11 in a translational sense with respect to the axes of rotation to the cams. The shaft 1 has lateral projections 8, 9 which couple to the cam lobes. When the shaft is moved in the direction of arrows 11 or 12 the eccentricity of the drive to the cams is varied and the valve timing is altered.
