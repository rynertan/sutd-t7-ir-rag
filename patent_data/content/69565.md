# Laser scalpel.

## Abstract
In a laser scalpel apparatus, an optical fibre 5 is used as a light guide, and the optical fibre is guided from a laser unit 1 housing a laser source, to the areas to be irradiated, along a support 4 fixed to the unit 1. The optical fibre is provided with a handpiece 7 embracing its forward end portion. The handpiece is shaped to facilitate the directing of the forward end of the fibre toward the areas to be irradiated. A supporting wire 9 is provided along the support 4 so as to be axially movable. The forward end of the wire is connected to the handpiece and the rear end of the wire is connected to balancing means 10 11 16 for counterbalancing the weight of the handpiece and the suspended part of the fibre 5 , so that the handpiece and the fibre can be easily moved to desired positions during an operation, and can be retained out of the way of the operating area when not in use.
