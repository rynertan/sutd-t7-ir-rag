## Description
SLIDE RULE FOR CALCULATING THE WORKING AND FREEZING PARAMETERSOF REFRIGERATING EQUIPMENT The present invention relates to a slidingrule for calculating the working and freezing parameters of refrigerating equipment, in particular, household refrigerators and or freezers.The only information shown on the rating plate of either 2 dpor refrigerators i.e. vith a fresh food compartment above zero and a freezer compartment below zero, one on top of the other or freezers i.e. with a single below zero compartment for long term storage of frozen food is the maximum amount of food in kilograms that can be frozen every 24 hours opera tion of the appliance. The said number of kilpgrams is calculated on the basis of a standard food item lean beef , though not all foods react to freezing in the same way. Different foods require different freezing times and temperatures depending on the amount of latent freezing heat they contain similar to the latent evaporating heat of a fluid i.e.the number of calories to be removed from the food at freezing temperature if it is to be frozen properly, which, in turn, depends on the percentage of water contained in the food.Freezers and 2 door refrigerators are therefore currently being operated wrongly with a considerable waste in energy.As only the maximum freezing capacity per 24 hours is shown on the rating plate, users are compelled to set the freeze control on the appliance to 24 hours a heavy burden on the compressor even when storing away much smaller amounts.Users are not placed in a position whereby they can calculate the length of time required to freeze the food and so disconnect the freeze control before the set 24 hours expires and so avoid a pointless waste in energy. Similarly, users cannot calculate the time needed to freeze foods which are easier to freeze than the sample item and thus require much less than the set 24 hours.The aim of the present invention is to provide a sliderule based on experimental data, for calculating the actual freezing time of different types of food depending on the different characteristics of each one A further aim of the present invention is to provide a sliderule based on experimental data, for calculating the freeze times and or amounts food which can be frozen in 24 hours using different types of refrigerators and freezers.A further aim of the present invention is to provide a sliderule for calculating the electricity consumption of refrigerating appliances according to the type of refrigerator and or freezer employed.A further aim of the present invention is to provide a sliderule showing how to set the thermostat in a refrigerating appliance according to room temperature.with these aims in view, the present invention relates to a slide rule for calculating the operating parameters of a refrige rating appliance, in particular a refrigerator or freezer, comprising at least one fixed part and one moving part, which moves in relation to the said fixed part, characterised by the fact that a first of the said parts is fitted with at least a first scale related to an operating parameter on the said appliance, the said parameter being used as input data for the said calculation, and at least a second scale related to an operating parameter on the said appliance depending on the said operating parameter used as input data and that the other of the said parts is designed to conceal the said second scale and is provided with at least one marker and windows for revealing at least one value on the said second scale when the said marker is set to a value on the said first scale and vice versa. The invention will now be described, by way of a non limiting example, with reference to the attached drawings in which Fig. 1 shows a plan view of the slidingrule according to the present invention Fig, 2 shows the Fig.1 slidingrule turned through 180 Fig. 3 shows two food charts, a and b, classified according to latent freezing heat content.Number 1 in Figure 1 and 2 indicates a slidingrule for calculating the operating and freezing parameters of freezers and refrigerators, particularly 2 door refrigerators with a freezercompartment. Slidingrule 1 consists of a combination of two separate slidingrules, 2 and 3, fitted to each other at the back. Both slidingrules 2 and 3 are circular and concentric but slidingrule 3 is larger in diameter than slidingrule 2. The latter is fitted on a flat rear face 4 of slidingrule 3 and comprises two mutually operating parts. a fixed circular part or disc 5 and a concentric circular part or disc 6, smaller in diameter than disc 5 and assembled so as to turn in relation to it.Disc 5 may be made in one piece with face 4 or fitted to it in any convenient manner, whereas disc 6 is fitted to part 5, e,g, by means of a pin not shown in the diagram. Slidingrule 2 also comprises a thermometer 7 of any known type, e.g. an analogue thermometer comprising a needle 8 and a graduated circular face 9, fitted concentrically on to discs 5 and 6 and integral with either one. Disc 6 is provided with 4 rectangular windows 10 arranged concentrically round the bottom half of its circumference 12 r ar the outside edge 11 , as well as 4 tables 13 arranged in the top half of the disc on face 14. Tables 13 and windows 10 are maked in the example shown by letters of the alphabet 15Each table 13 is marked in the same way 15 as one of windows 10 to indicate a similar category of food, classified according to water content or latent freezing heat. In the example shown, tables 13 are marked A, B, C and D in the same way as windows 10.In Fig. 3, letters A, B , C and D refer to the food division shown in table b, in which A indicates food P with a latent freezing heat content C.C. below 50 tcal, Kg, B food with a latent heat content ranging from 50 to 60 Kcal Kg, C food ranging from 60 to 70 Kcal, Kg and D food ranging from 70 to 80 Xcal Kg, By way of an example, the dots in table a of Fig. 3 show which of the above categories a number of commonly used foodstuffs belong to. in tables 13, these foodstuffs are shown either by a list of names or, as in the example, by symbols showing users of sliderule 2 which food categories letters A, B, C and D 15 refer to.To make things easier for the user, a variation not shown in the diagram provides for eliminating letters 15 and tables 13 are arranged separately each next to the window io it refers to. In this case, tables 13 are also arranged in the bottom half 12 of disc 6 next to their respective windows 10 or, alternatively, both windows 10 and their respective tables 13 are spread out over a wider arc to occupy both the top and bottom 12 of disc 6. The latter is also provided with a reference mark 16 with a plate 18 underneath showing a preset weight of food, de pening on the type of freezer being used Disc 5 has a first 19 and second 20 number scale the numbers of which are arranged on a circumference concentric with disc 6 on the outside edge 21 of disc 5. Scale 19 shows five fractions of the abovementioned preset weight of food shown on plate 18 4 4, 3 4, 2 4, 1 4 and less than 1 4. Scale 20 shows the experimented minimum freeze times of va rious types of food expressed in various numbers of hours which can only be seen through windows 10 in that the diame ter of disc 6 covers scale 20.Sliderule2 is used for calculating the freeze time of food placed inside a knawn type of freezer, not shown in the diagram, with a hand operated control for keeping the compressor on the cool ing circuit running freeze setting so as to freeze a preset weight of food in 24 hours when the abovementioned control is turned on. The said quantity of food, expressed in kilograms, depends on the type of freezer and is therefore indicated by the maker on the appliance plate. This weight is copied either by the user or the maker into the space provided on plate 18 so as to associate each value on scale 19 with a specific weight of food. For example, if the maximum capacity of the freezer shown on plate 18 is 12 Keg, 24 hours, the 4 4 setting corresponds to 12 Kg of food being frozen in the freezer the 3 4 setting corresponds to a weight of 12 Kg divided by 4 and multiplied by 3 9 Kg and so on.Supposing the user wants to freeze 12 Kg of food type A see table 3a e.g. ham and lamb. Normally, the. user would load the food into the freezer, turn on the freeze control and wait 24 hours before turning it off. Using sliderule 2, however the user can calculate the exact freeze time required and, if this is less than 24 hours, turn the control off sooner so as to cut down on energy consumption. Assuming the maximum capacity shown on plate 18 is 12 Kg, all the user has to do is set mark 16 to 4 4 on scale 19 the weight of food being frozen in this case is the same as the maximum capacity of the freezer and read the number of hours for freezing shown in window 10 marked A relative to type A foodstuffs which are also shown on table 13 marked A .In Fig. 2, the number of hours needed is 20, after which time, the food will be frozen and the freeze control can be turned off.If, on, the other hand, the food being frozen is liver and ice cream,.for example, the user will see from table 13 that these belong to group B and will read the scale 19 value shown in window 10 marked B. If, instead of a number, the user sees an asterisk or other symbol in window 10, this means that the chosen weight of the product in question re squires more than 24 hours for freezing and must therefore be frozen in more than one operation.Similarly, for lighter weights e.g. 9 Kg, or 3 4 of maximum capacity or foods all belonging to group A, the freeze times shown will be even lower 15. hours so that C and or D type foods with a greater latent freezing heat content than lean beef may also be frozen within the same 24 hours. Essentially speaking, when marker 16 is set to a given value on scale 19, the corresponding freeze times of the same amounts of each type of food are shown at the same time in windows 10 of scale 20.Thermometer 7, which is preferably fitted to disc 6 but which may also be fitted to slidingrule 3, has essentially psychological function in that it enables the user to read and keep a check on the temperature inside the freezer during both the freezing stage and normal operation of the freezer. Also, to use the thermometer, the user must place slidingrule 1 inside the freezer and, having the slidingrule readily at hand whenever freezer is opened and loaded, is induced to use it. This prevents the possibility wE users not making use of the slidingrule, which commonly occurs in the case of ordinary freeze tables which are usually thrown away or lost or placed where they are never used.Slidingrule 3 operates and may be used sepa mately from sliding rule 2for calculating electricity consumption, freeze times and the amount of food which can be frozen in either freezers or re frigerators. Though the weight of food that can be frozen in 2 door refrigerators is lower than that of a freezer, tests have shown that, by dividing the amount of food to be frozen in 24 hours into two or more parts, which are then frozen in successive stages, still totalling 24 hours, the weight of food that can be frozen may be increased considerably.The main function of sliderule 3 is therefore to enable the user to calculate the lenght of the first freezing stage, given the weight of food placed inside the freezer, and so calculate how much food can be frozen in subsequent stages within the said 24 hours.Sliderule 2 fig.l consists of a disc .21 with the abovementioned rear face on which sliderule 2 is fitted and a second disc 22 concentric with disc 21 but smaller in diameter and fitted so as to turn round it. Disc 22 is divided into four sections 23,24,25,38 each with a number. of windows or rectangular openings 26 and respective markers 27,28, 29,40 . Windows 26 of each section 23,24,25,38 are arranged Along a radius of disc 22 for revealing numbers on the underlying scales on disc 21 covered by disc 22. Windows 26 of each section 23,24,25138 are also marked 31 to distinguish between different types of refrigerators and freezers with different loading and cooling capacities. Disc 21 has a number scale 32 showing the weight of food that can be frozen, considered as a total and not subdivide1 into categories with diffrent latent freezing heat contents. The weights kilograms shoun on scale 32 therefore refer to a sample food lean beef with an average latent freezing heat content. Scale 32 is located in section 23 of disc 22 Qn the outside edge of disc 21 so as to be swept by marker 27. A further set o number scales 33, 33a is fitted under neath disc 22, concentric with scale 32, for showing the mini mum times in hours required for freezing the amounts of food shown on scale 32 using different types of freezers, and the energy consumption associated with each freeze time.Scales 33 and 33a are worked out experimentally.The outside edge of disc 21 has a further number scale 34 located in section 24, a number scale 35 in section 25, next to scale 34, and a number scale 39 in section 38, next to scale 35. Scale 34 shows the weight of food that can be frozen in the first stage of a 2 door refrigerator, and scale 35 the weight of food that can be frozen by the same 2 door refrigerator in a second stage immediately following the first and terminating within 24 hours from the start of the said first stage. Next to scales 34 and 35, swept by markers 28 and 29 and concentric with them, disc 21 is fitted with number scales 36 and 37 which are covered by disc 22 and can be read through windows 26 in sections 24 and 25.Scale 36 shows the minimum times required for freezing the amounts of food shown on scale 34 using different types of 2 door refrigerators, the said scale 36 being worked out experimentally.Scale 37 depends on the length of the first freezing stage and is used for determining, on scale 35, the maximum amount of food that can be frozen in the second stage, at the same time ensuring that the food frozen in the first stage is kept roughly below 150C the minimum temperature above which frozen food may deteriorate even in a short time . Scale 37 is expressed in hours based on the corresponding values on scale 36 to which a standard preset time of four hours, calculated experimentally, is always added.Tests, in fact, have shown that loading food at room temperature into the freezer compartment of a refrigerator in which other food has only just been frozen can raise the temperature inside the freezer so as to damage the frozen food inside by raising its temperature over 15 C. A certain length of time calculated to be four hours must therefore be allowed to pass before placing unfrozen food inside the freezer. When freezing food in successive stages, therefore, the second stage does not commence as soon as the food inside the freezer has been frozen but only after its temperature has fallen low enough to ensure that the minimum temperature will not be exceeded even if fresh food is placed inside the freezet before the 24 holr term expires.Consequently, whereas scale 36 shows the freeze times for food placed Inside the freezer in the first stage, scale 37 shows the total time of stage onepplus the set four hours, after which the second stage may be commenced.Number scale 39 shows room temperatures within a preset range, e.g. 16 C to 320C. Beneath disc 22, disc 27 has a set of scales 41, 41a concentric with scale 39 and which can be read through windows 26 in section 38. Scales 41 are indicated in full by means of letters or numbers e.g. MIN, MED, MAX to show the correct minimum consumption setting of the thermostat on the refrigerator as a function of room temperature.Number scales 41a show the energy consumption of each thermostat setting on scales 41 as a function of room temperature.Both scales 41 and 41a are worked out experimentally. Sliderule 3 is used for regulating both freezers and 2 or singledoor refrigerators. In the case of a freezer with a freeze control, the user turns disc 22 to set marker 27 to the required food weight on scale 32, and then reads the required freeze time in hours on one of scales 33 in window 26 bearing the reference number 31 of the type of freezer being used After the said freeze time expires, the control may be turned off. If freeze time is less than 24 hours, this arrangement provides for considerable saving in energy as compared with the current system whereby the control and con sequently also the compressor is kept running regardless for 24 hours. The user can also read on the corresponding 33a scale the electricity consumption in kilowatt hours of the freeze time shown on scale 33. In the case of a 2 door refrigerator, the user sets marker 28 to the first stage food weight on scale 34 and then reads the minimum freeze time required in hours on one of scales 35 in window 26 bearing the reference number 31 of the type of refrigerator being used. At this point, if the user wishes to place more food inside the freezer within the next 24 hours, he or she must add 4 hours to the time shown prepiously and, by turning disc 22, read the time shown on scale 37 in window 26, section 25, bearing the same reference number 31 as window 26, section 24, from which the previous reading was made. hen this reading is made on the corresponding scale marked 37, marker 29 on scale 35 will show the amount of food in kilograms that can be frozen in a second stage starting from the end of the four hours added on to the first stage and within the total 24 hours calculated from the start of the said first stage.In the example shown in Fig. 1, scales 36 and 37 on sliderule 3 are provided with scales 36a and 37a showing the experimented energy consumption of the refrigerator in kilowatt hours.In this way, Lhe user can also read in section 24, besides the freeze time, the amount of energy required for freezing and, in section 25, besides the weight of food that can still be frozen, the amount of energy required for a second freeze stage. Given a specific weight of food for freezing, the user can thus calculate how best to divide it up to obtain a mini mum total freeze time and minimum consumption for a given weight or the maximum amount of frozen food for a given consumption, i.e. minimum specific consumption in kilowatthours per Kg of food.For example, 8 Keg of food can be frozen in a refrigerator marked F 375 see Fig. 1 , though the 24 hour freezing rate shown on the plate is 5 Kg, by dividing the load into a first portion of 5 Kg frozen in 11 hours followed 15 hours later 11 4 by another 3 Kg of food to give a total consumption of about 2700 kilowatt hours. Alternatively, the load may be divided up so as to give a total freeze time of less than 24 hours so that more food, totalling 9 Kg for example, may be frozen with the same consumption of 2700 Xilowatt hours. In the case of 2 door or freezerless refrigerators, the user can work out the correct setting for the fresh food compartment thermostat as a function of room temperature. To do this, all he or she has to do is turn disc 22 to set marker 40 to the value on scale 39 corresponding to the temperature of thebroom the refrigerator is operating in and read in window 26 bearing the reference number 31 of the refrigerator being used the correct thermostat setting e.g. NED shown on alphabetical scale s and the energy consumption associated with this thermostat setting on scale 41a.The advantages of the present invention will be clear from the description given. In particular, it provides for an easy to use instrument supplying the users of refrigerators and or freezers with all the information needed for correct operation of the appliance, for limiting and or reducing the energy conswmption Or the appliance and or increasing performance by freezing large quantities of food with guaranteed safetyThe major advantage of the invention, however, is that it provides for freezing much larger quantities of food than that shown on the maker s plate on the freezer with no substantial increase in energy consumption. To those skilled in the art it will be clear that various changes can be made to the invention described by way of a non limiting example without, however, departing from the scope of the said invention
