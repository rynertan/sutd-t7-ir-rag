# An electrical connector.

## Abstract
An electrical connector for use in arc welding comprises a magnet 14 of generally toroidal shape housed in a cup shape support 23 and secured by a screw 15 to a body 11 having a surrounding annular face 12 substantially coplanar with the end face 22 of the rim of the cup shape support. The magnet is made from a material incorporating a high proportion of cobalt having a low temperature coefficient which is resistant to high temperatures and substantially unaffected by the high welding current which flows therethrough in operation.
