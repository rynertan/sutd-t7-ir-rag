# Improvements to splicer devices for the mechanical splicing of textile yarns, and mechanical splicer device which employs such improvements.

## Abstract
This invention is obtained with improvements to splicer devices 10 making a splice between two yarns by the mechanical removal and recomposition of twists, such splicer devices 10 comprising means to untwist and retwist yarn which have a substantially circular form, such means possibly including operational means 70 . Such splicer devices 10 include means able to pluck and or tear excessive tail ends of yarn and to obtain small remaining tails of yarn. According to the improvements of the invention such splicer devices 10 contain at least one of the following aspects adjustable cam means 37 38 which condition the untwisting and retwisting separately, spacer means 91 able to keep the surfaces which work on the yarn, at a desired distance at least momentarily, movable portions 47 147 of the plucking and or tearing means 42 142 which can move in opposite directions, and means to tension yarn 101 which carry out a drawing action, the surfaces on which the operational means 70 are placed being conformed as required. The invention is also embodied with splicer devices 10 which employ the above improvements.
