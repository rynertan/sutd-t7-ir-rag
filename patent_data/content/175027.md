# Method of laundering and delivering linens.

## Abstract
A method for linen handling in a hospital or similar institution uses non iron sheets with colour coded thread and corresponding colour net containers to simplify and facilitate handling and distribution of linens. A daily bed care unit 18 has a set of linens for a complete bed change. When a set is changed it is placed in a white net 34 for laundering and returned as a set. When individual sheets, etc., are changed they are sorted into colour coded bags 22 , 24 , 26 , 28 and returned as spares. Alternative embodiments sort the linens after launder ing, at least for individual items, while sets may be kept together.
