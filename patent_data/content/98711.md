# Electrical machining system and method of processing a machining liquid therein.

## Abstract
An electrical machining system utilizing a machining liquid 7 consisting at least in a major part of an aqueous solution containing a deionized water and a surface active agent dis solved therein, the latter having a temperature dependent solu bility in the solution and a cloud point, i.e. a temperature below which it remains dissolved therein. The machining liquid 7 is supplied into a machining zone 2 which produces a liquid effluent having machining products entrapped therein. The liquid effluent is fed to a separation zone where it is heated at a temperature above a cloud point thereof to separate an amount of the surface active agent therefrom and to collect that amount substantially in a solid form while forming a liquid output constituted by a remainder of the liquid effluent. The surface active agent is collected by deposition on a carrier material, e.g. iron particles. The carrier material having the deposit of the surface active agent may be brought into contact with a cool deionized water to form a solution of the collected surface active agent therein.
