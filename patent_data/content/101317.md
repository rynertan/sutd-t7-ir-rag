# BILATERAL DIGITAL DATA TRANSMISSION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A digital data transmission system for transmitting digital data from digital data handling hardware 5 over a transmission line by analog signal representation and for receiving analog signal representation for reception of digital signals by the digital data handling hardware, incorporates an integrated circuit Phase Shift Keying PSK modem. The modem has a transmitter which includes a buffer 11 for accomodating a variety of protocols, an encoder 12 for encoding digital data into a first format for conversion to corresponding PSK signals, a modulator 13 implemented in switched capacitor circuits, for phase modulating a first carrier frequency according to the first format, and first and second filters 14 for compensation of gain and phase distortion, respectively, in the transmission line. The modem has a receiver that includes a demodulator 20 implemented in switched capacitor circuits, including filter switches, for demodulating PSK signals on a second carrier frequency to provide a second format for conversion to corresponding digital signals, an encoder 22 for encod ing the second format into corresponding digital signals, and a clock recovery circuit 21 including a phase locked loop and a dual integrator voltage controlled oscillator. The receiver includes compensating filters 18 for transmission line gain and phase distortion, automatic gain control 19 and adaptive equalization filtering in the demod ulator 20 for reducing cross talk noise between the trans mission and receiving lines.
