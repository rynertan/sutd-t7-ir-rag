## Description
The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for logging earth formations penetrated by a well borehole, and more particularly to improved methods and apparatus for determining formation and borehole characteristics by the analysis of gamma rays entering the borehole from naturally occurring formation radiation. The invention thus has partic ular relevance to the determination of the absolute elemental abundances of potassium K , uranium U , and thorium Th in the earth formations adjacent the borehole. Modern well logging tools typically contain gamma ray sondes for detecting the photons emitted by naturally radioactive potassium uranium and thorium elements. These elements are present to at least some degree in all earth formations. In recent years, gamma ray spectroscopy of earth formations to determine the weight concentrations of these three significant radioactive elements has been made prac tical by the development of highly stable scintil lation detectors which may be lowered into a well borehole and which produce a pulse height spectrum proportional to the gamma ray energy spectrum of gamma rays impinging upon the scintillation crystal. The number of gamma rays detected in a liq uid filled borehole, however, is less than the number emitted into the borehole at the borehole wall, due to scattering and absorption phenomena in the bore hole fluid and other intervening materials, such as casing, cement, and so forth. These attenuation effects can therefore result in erroneous measure ments unless corrections are applied. Only in the case of an air filled borehole is the attenuation negligible. Unfortunately, known means for applying corrections have been less than optimum, depending in many cases upon empirical compensation methods based upon comparisons with data from standard, known bore hole conditions. Many boreholes, however, display parameters and conditions differing greatly from these standards. There will be no error in the final log, of course, if the borehole conditions, such as diameter and mud weight, happen to match the standard conditions of the tool sensitivity cali bration. A need therefore remains for a method and apparatus which can determine and compensate for such borehole attenuation effects upon the gamma radia tions, which can accurately do so under widely vary ing borehole conditions, and which is versatile, uncomplicated, and readily suited to use in virtually all natural gamma ray spectral borehole logging ap plications. Briefly, the present invention meets the above needs and purposes by providing methods and ap paratus which utilize an analytic function that accu rately gives the fraction of photons transmitted through the borehole fluid for arbitrary tool stand off and borehole sizes, and for arbitrary con ditions which are commonly encountered. In one embodiment, the invention utilizes a borehole measurement system located with the bore hole to detect the gamma radiations coming from the earth formations adjacent thereto. Count signals representative of the detected radiations are then generated. A determination is made of the overall attenuation effect upon the count signals which is caused by such factors as 1 the extent to which the measurement within the borehole is an eccentered measurement, 2 multiple borehole materials, 3 the photoelectric effect, 4 Compton scattering, 5 po tassium chloride mud, 6 barite mud, and 7 casing within the borehole. The count signals are then com bined, and compensation is provided for this overall attenuation effect, thereby furnishing a measurement indicator which much more accurately represents the properties of the adjacent earth formations. It is therefore a feature of the present invention to provide a new and improved borehole log ging method and apparatus such a method and appa ratus which measure properties of earth formations adjacent the borehole as a function of radiations coming from the earth formations which compensate for borehole attenuation effects upon such radia tions which detect, in the borehole, radiations com ing from the earth formations adjacent thereto and generate count signals representative of the detected radiations which determine the attenuation effect upon the count signals caused by the borehole mate rials which combine these count signals and compensate for the attenuation effect according to a predetermined relationship to provide a measurement indicator represen tative of selected properties of the adjacent earth formations and to accomplish the above features and purposes in an inexpensive, uncomplicated, durable, versatile, and reliable method and apparatus readily suited to the widest possible utilization in the measurement of earth formation properties adjacent to a borehole as a function of radiations coming from the earth formations. In order that the invention may be more fully understood, embodiments thereof will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which With reference to the drawings, the new and improved gamma ray borehole logging method and appa ratus having compensation for borehole attenuation effects, according to the present invention, will now be described. Referring to Fig. 1, a well logging system in accordance with the concepts of the present invention is illustrated schematically. A well bore hole 41 penetrates earth formations 46 and is lined with a steel casing 68. Typically, a cement annulus not shown will also be present between the casing 68 and the earth formations 46. The borehole 41 con tains a well bore fluid 42 to control pressure in subsurface formations. It will be understood that the invention can also be used in open hole as well as cased hole. Suspended in the borehole 41, by an armored well logging cable 56 of the conventional type, is a downhole measurement probe or sonde 43 containing instrumentation for measuring gamma ray spectral characteristics of the earth formations 46 penetrated by the borehole 41. Signals from the downhole sonde 43 are conducted to the surface on conductors of the cable 56 and supplied to a surface computer 54 which performs signal processing to extract the elemental constituents of potassium, uranium and thorium present in the earth formations 46. These are then recorded as a function of borehole depth on the recorder 55. The well logging cable 56 passes over a sheave wheel 44 which is electrically or mechanically coupled as indicated by a dotted line 45 to the computer 54 and recorder 55 in order to provide depth information about the downhole sonde 43 for the sur face recording process. In the preferred embodiment, the downhole sonde 43 contains, near the lower end thereof, a gamma ray detecting system comprising a scintillation crystal 47 and a photomultiplier and amplifier pack age 48. Power for the operation of the downhole sonde system is supplied from a surface power supply 53, via conductors of the cable 56, to a downhole power supply 51 where it is converted to appropriate voltage levels and supplied to the downhole circuitry components of the system as illustrated in Fig. 1. Gamma ray spectral signals are supplied from the pho tomultiplier tube 48 to a pulse height analyzer 49 where they are typically separated into count rates in four or more energy windows. The pulse height analyzer provides the out put signals corresponding to the count rates in each of the energy windows to a telemetry system 50 where the pulse height gamma ray spectral information is converted to an appropriate wave form for transmis sion to the surface via conductors of the well log ging cable 56. Downhole control circuits 51 provide timing pulses to the pulse height analyzer and telem etry system in order to synchronize the transmission at regular data intervals from the downhole sonde 43 to the surface equipment. There synchronization sig nals are also encoded in the telemetry system 50 and supplied to the surface computer 54. Thus, naturally occurring gamma rays from the earth formations 46 are detected by the scintil lation crystal and photomultiplier detector system 47 and 48 in the downhole sonde 43, broken down into their energy constituents by the pulse height ana lyzer 49, and telemetered to the surface by the telemetry system 50 on conductors of the armored well logging cable 56. At the surface, the signals are processed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention to extract the radioactive elemen tal constituency of the earth formations 46 pene trated by the borehole 41. The processing of the signals at the sur face, in the preferred embodiment, is done using the method of weighted least squares WLS to calculate the K, U, and Th concentrations. It can be written in matrix form as 1 C AM and the corresponding WLS solution T is transpose, 1 is inverse is 2 M A For non standard conditions the following relation holds 3 A When non standard borehole conditions are encountered, the shape and intensity of the recorded gamma ray spectrum changes due to variations in the scattering and absorption properties of the borehole. This is illustrated in Fig. 3, which shows high energy spectra in potassium rich laboratory forma tions with uncased, cased, as well as cemented and cased borehole conditions. From Fig. 3 it can be seen that the amount of downscattering, and hence the shape of each spectrum, is directly related to the quantity of material in the borehole. Observe that the actual shape of the curve changes, so that simple scale compensation e.g., by taking relative ratios will ordinarily not work. Also observe that the quantity of borehole material affects the count rate in the potassium peak itself, as indicated by the range of normalization factors in Fig. 3. These spectral variations induce changes in the sensitivity matrix A of equation 1 . The sensitivity matrix must be adjusted for borehole conditions as K, U, and Th are being determined in order to obtain accurate ele mental concentration measurements. A further discussion of such a matrix bore hole compensation method, and the substantial im provements which can be obtained thereby, may be found in A Multi Function Compensated Spectral Nat ural Gamma Ray Logging System , by H.D. Smith, Jr., C.A. Robbins, D.M. Arnold, L.L. Gadeken, and J.G. Deaton Society of Petroleum Engineers of AIME, Paper 12050, October, 1983 , and Applications of the Com pensated Spectral Natural Gamma Tool , by L.L. Gadeken, D.M. Arnold, and H.D. Smith, Jr. SPWLA 25th Annual symposium, Paper JJJ, June, 1984 . The very important improvements described in these papers may be seen, for example, in Figs. 9 and 10 of Paper JJJ above , which show that essentially the identical K, U, and Th results were measured both before and after the well was cased. These improvements resulted from adjusting the sensitivity matrix for borehole condi tions, and clearly underscore the value and utility of accurate borehole compensation. The present invention, which is related to the improvements described in the above papers, is directed to a method and apparatus for arriving at the functional form of the F It is well known that the functional form which describes gamma ray attenuation in good geome try a narrow pencil of gamma photons passing through an absorbing slab located between source and detec tor is proportional to e The borehole logging tool 43 typically detects gamma photons in an energy range from 20 keV to 3000 keV. It is important to remember that pho toelectric effects of materials such as barite can affect the estimates of the K, U, and Th concentra tions. We therefore now turn to consideration of gamma ray attenuation in the photoelectric energy region. The expression for the cross section is 6 Σ It is convenient to define a normalized photoelectric cross section per electron 8 P Since for natural gamma ray spectroscopy the pair production cross section can be neglected, the total gamma ray attenuation cross section is 9 Σ Σ In fact, in a well bore the gamma ray emit ting formation material completely surrounds detector 47 in logging sonde 43. In addition to the attenu ation of gamma rays passing through the borehole fluid 42, there are multiple scattering effects as well. It is possible, using modern radiation trans port computer codes which incorporate Monte Carlo or discrete ordinates algorithms, to calculate all rel evant scattering and absorption effects in a borehole geometry. However, in so doing, the form of equa tion 10 is lost. In the context of the simple model which is the basis of this invention, the form of equation 10 is retained. That is to say 11 Σ κρ Referring now to Fig. 4, the method for the analysis of the borehole gamma ray attenuation, and the compensation therefor, according to the present invention, will now be explained. Assume that a cylindrical borehole 60 has penetrated a formation 62 which has a source of gamma photons uniformly dis tributed throughout. A cylindrical gamma ray sonde 65 is placed in the borehole 60 and its contents 67 in order to measure the gamma ray flux. The problem is to determine the fraction of gamma rays emitted at the borehole wall which reach the sonde 65 after being attenuated by the borehole fluid 67. Fig. 4 shows the geometry in two dimensions. The parameters are S sonde radius B borehole radius ρ fluid density T offset from borehole center D distance through borehole fluid. The attenuation at any angle ϑ is assumed to be given by 12 A ϑ e The model represented by equation 12 states that the only effect of importance is the attenuation between the borehole wall and the sonde. All multiple scattering effects are ignored. This procedure is successful partly because κ is not taken from tabulations of narrow beam attenuation coef ficients, but is fit to experimental data or to Monte Carlo or discrete ordinates transport calculations. Thus, the κ parameter allows much of the true com plexity of the problem to be hidden. The total attenuation is given by inte grating equation 12 over all angles 13 A The parameter β is a normalization constant which may be selected quite arbitrarily, and is usu ally chosen so that A is unity in the standard con ditions. The distance parameter is 14 D ϑ B² T sinϑ ² When the sonde is centered the distance is independent of angle 15 D Returning to the evaluation of count sig nals generated by an eccentered sonde, it is a sub stantial advantage to be able to perform real time evaluation, on the logging truck at the borehole 41, of the extent of the borehole attenuation. However, the computational power in the surface computers 54 which are usually used is presently too limited to be able to perform the necessary numerical integrations in the time available. To overcome this problem, equation 13 can be approximated by Thus far the discussions and analysis have been specific to open hole geometry. It is impor tant, of course, to generalize the analysis to account for conditions encountered in actual borehole conditions. Thus multiple borehole materials, the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, potassium chloride mud, barite mud, and casing within the bore hole must also be considered. In the analysis of multiple borehole mate rials, a typical cased hole geometry is shown in Fig. 5, the casing 68 separating the fluid 67 which is within the casing from the fluid 67 which is out side of it. The generalization of equation 13 is A non negligible fraction of the wells drilled have potassium chloride added to the mud to help stabilize the formation. This perturbs the measurement of potassium in the formation due to its presence in the borehole fluid. In the two dimen sional model described herein, the increase in the counting rates for the windows in the energy region to which the potassium contributes is given by the double integral Let us reconsider how to approximate the integrals of equations 13 , 19 , and 20 . In equa tion 16 set L The more complex problem of determining L for an arbitrary borehole geometry is then solved as follows. From equation 19 it is clear that for cen tered geometry with multiple annuli of different ma terials, equation 19 becomes It has been found empirically that for eccentered geometries the eccentered parameter L The natural gamma ray spectrum gathered by a natural gamma ray spectral logging tool may cover the entire energy range from zero to 3000 KeV. It is clear that an L value may be selected for any arbi trary energy range. However, in order to minimize the number of parameters involved, it has been found reasonable to restrict the number of L s to two. These are L In a preferred embodiment, the energy ranges for the L s defined above were selected as follows L Equation 20 gives the general expression for determining the attenuation for arbitrary bore hole contents. Consider then the case for which the L values are fixed and the parameters necessary for their calculation are input before logging. In open hole situations where the borehole contents are rel atively light, for example, light mud, or fresh or salt water, the photoelectric absorption in the bore holes is much smaller than that due to the formation, and L As may be seen therefore, the present in vention has numerous advantages. It provides an uncomplicated and highly versatile method and appa ratus which utilize a new and unobvious analytical function for specifying and compensating for the attenuation of gamma rays in a borehole environment. It effectively separates the energy dependent atten uation factors from the factors which are a measure of the amount of material present in the borehole. The invention is readily suited to use in virtually all natural gamma ray spectral well borehole logging applications. In its general realization, it is equally appropriate and effective in compensating for borehole attenuation effects upon any radiations, whether natural or artificial, which enter the bore hole from the adjacent earth formations. Radiations generated within the borehole, such as from radio active materials in the drilling mud, can also be included and corrected. Compensation can be made for mud weighting materials regardless of type, e.g., barite, hematite, ilmenite, etc. The invention fur ther provides methods and apparatus whereby these various compensations can be provided in real time, so that accurate compensations can be made contem poraneously while a well borehole is being logged. While the methods and forms of apparatus herein described constitute preferred embodiments of this invention, it is to be understood that the in vention is not limited to these precise methods and forms of apparatus, and that changes may be made.
