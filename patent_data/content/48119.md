## Description
METHODS OF PREPARING POLYIMIDES AND ARTIFACTS COMPOSED THEREOF The invention described herein was made in the performance of work under NASA Contract No. NAS9 15484 and is subject to the provisions of section 305 of the NationalAeronautics and Space Act of 1958 72 Stat. 435 42 USC 2457 . In one aspect our invention relates to polyimides and, more particularly, to novel, improved methods for preparing polymers of that character. As a class, polyimides are extremely valuable materials because of their chemical inertness, strength, and temperature resistance. There are also certain classes of proprietary polyimides which have such additional advantages as retention of strength, resiliency, and flexibility at cryogenic temperatures resistance to hydrolysis and ultraviolet degration capability of undergoing oxidative degradation without generating toxic products or smoke a novel closed cell structure which suits them for applications in which they are in contact with moving parts the capacity to be transformed into porous fibers and other shapes and into rigid panels, cushioning, thermal acoustical insulation and a host of other novel products.These polyimides are disclosed in, inter alia, U.S. patents nos. 3,506,583 issued April 14, 1970, to Boram et al 3,726,831 and 3,726,834 issued April 10, 1973, to Acle et al and Acle respectively 4,070,312 issued January 24, 1978, to Gagliani et al and Re 30,213 issued February 12, 1980, to Gagliani and in pending U.S. patent applications nos. 935,378 and 952,738 filed August 21, 1978, and October 19, 1978, by Gagliani and 186,668 filed September 12, 1980, by Gagliani et al. Application no. 935,378 has since matured into patent no. 4,241,193 dated December 23, 1980.U.S. Application No. 186,668 corresponds to EuropeanPatent Application No. 81303041.8. These proprietary polyimides are prepared by reacting 3,3 , 4,4 benzophenonetetracarboxylic acid or a dianhydride of that acid with a lower alkyl alcohol to form a half ester of the acid and then adding one or more pri mary diamines to the half ester solution to form an essentially monomeric precursor. This monomer is then converted to a polyimide by heating it. Many of these polyimides have the added attribute of a cellular or foam type physical structure. The foam can be employed as such in a seat cushion or as insulation, for example. Or, using the procedure described in application no. 935,378 as a further example, the flexible, resilient polyimide foam can be converted to a dense, rigid, structurally strong, intumescent material by heating it under pressure. The foam can also be coimninuted and used as a molding powder as described in patent no.3,726,834. The general model for the chemical reactions which are effected in converting the precursor to a polyimide of the character discussed above are shown below. The actual reactions are typically much more complex depending upon the number of diamines in the precursor.EMI2.1 tb I SEP Esftrificntion tb SEP o SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 tb SEP II SEP H SEP SEP II tb SEP EtH G SEP HO C SEP Oi SEP QE tb SEP u SEP o SEP II SEP GH tb SEP ElH C SEP C11 tb SEP o SEP OL U o ir SEP o SEP o SEP 0 tb SEP SEP SEP NH Ar NH2 tb SEP HEAT tb It SEP Am SEP idizat SEP ion tb SEP 0 SEP 0 tb SEP 11 SEP II tb SEP H G SEP 0 SEP C OEt tb SEP Ef04C01 NX Ar tb SEP 0 SEP O SEP n tb SEP HEAT tb 211 SEP Imidlzctian tb SEP N SEP CIoCC H2O EtOH tb SEP O SEP O SEP n tb Heretofore, the foaming of the precursor and the curing of the foam to develop the polyimide chemical structure have been accomplished by heating the precursor in a circulating air oven. We have now discovered that polyimide foams of superior quality can be produced, typically in less time, by employing microwave heating to cure the precursor. In addition to being faster, microwave heating has the advantages of producing foams with a more homogeneous cellular structure and of making it unnecessary to handle the fragile, uncured foam which is generated as the precursor is heated. Exemplary of the polyimide foams which can be prepared to advantage by the use of microwave heating in accord with the principles of the present invention are the, copolymers described in U.S. Reissue Patent No. 30,213 and the terpolymers described in copending application no.186,668. The patented copolymers are derived from precursors which, in their preferred forms, are essentially equimolar mixtures of a lower alkyl half ester of BTDA and two primary diamines. One of the diamines is a heterocyclic diamine, and the other is an aromatic meta or para substituted diamine which is free of aliphatic moieties. A ratio of 0.4 to 0.6 mole of heterocyclic diamine per mole of 3,3 , 4,4 benzophenonetetracarboxylic acid ester is preferred as this results in foams with optimal mechanical properties. However, precursors having a heterocyclic diamine acid ester ratio of 0.3 have also successfully been employed. The terpolyimides described in copending application no. 186,668 differ chemically from the copolyimides just described in that they are made from precursors which include an aliphatic diamine in addition to the aromatic and heterocyclic diamines employed in the copolyimide precursors. From 0.05 to 0.3 mole of aliphatic diamine per 1.0 mole of benzophenonetetracarboxylic acid ester can be employed, and from 0.1 to 0.3 mole of heterocyclic diamine per mole of ester can be used. Exemplary of the aromatic and heterocyclic diamines that can be employed in the just described copolyimides are 2,6 diaminopyridine 3,5 diaminopyridine 3,3 diaminodiphenyl sulfone 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulfide 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether 3,3 diaminodiphenyl ether 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether meta phenylene diamine para phenylene diamine p,p methylene dianiline 2,6 diamino toluene 2,4 diamino toluene Many other aromatic and heterocyclic diamines have been described in the open and patent literature dealing with the making of polyimides see, for example, U.S. patents nos. 3,179,614 issued April 20, 1965, to Edwards 3,575,891 issued April 20, 1971, to LeBlanc et al and 3,629,180 issued December 21, 1971, to Yoda et al.Aromatic and heterocyclic diamines selected from those listed in the literature can also be utilized in copolyimides and terpolyimides of the character described above. Aliphatic diamines having from three to 12 carbon atoms have been employed in the terpolyimides. However, diamines having no more than six carbon atoms will typically prove preferable. Also, aliphatic diamines with even numbered chains are preferred. Aliphatic diamines we have used include 1,3 diaminopropane 1,4 diaminobutane 1,6 diaminohexane 1,8 diaminooctane 1, 12 diaminododecane and Jeffamine 230. The latter is available from theJefferson Chemical Company and has the formula EMI5.1 where x is approximately 2.6. As discussed briefly above, the precursors of the polyimides with which we are concerned are prepared by first reacting 3,3 , 4,4 benzophenonetetracarboxylic acid or preferably, its dianhydride with an esterification agent to form an alkyl diester or half ester. Exemplary esterification agents are methyl, ethyl, propyl, and isopropyl alcohols. Methanol is in many cases preferred because of its widespread availability, low cost, and other attributes because its use facilitates conversion of the precursor to a polyimide foam and because the foams made from the methyl esters tend to be more flexible, resilient, and compression set resistant. Ethanol is also a preferred esterification agent. The esterification reaction is followed by the addition of the diamine or diamines, which are dissolved in the reaction mixture. The temperature is kept below the reflux temperature of the esterification agent during dissolution of the diamines and low enough to avoid polymerization of the diamines and ester. Graphite, glass, and other fibers as well as other fillers such as glass microballoons and additives such as cross linking agents can be added to the resulting composition to impart wanted properties to the final product. A surfactant can also be added to increase fatigue resistance and to make the foam more flexible and resilient by increasing its bubble stability and the uniformity of the cellular structure. One preferred surfactant is FS B, a nonionic, fluorinated, polyalkylene copolymer manufactured by E. I.DuPont de Nemours and Company. Other surfactants that have been successfully employed are FS C, AS 2, and X 3, nonionic surfactants of the same general chemical composition as FS B and manufactured by the same company and L 530, L 5410, andL 5430, which are silicone surfactants manufactured byUnion Carbide Company. We employ from 0.015 to 1.5 percent of surfactant based on the weight of the ester and diamine constituents. The material existing after dissolution of the diamines and the addition of any additives may range in form from a liquid resin to a spreadable, pastelike formulation depending upon the nature and quantity of any fillers added to the resin. The material may be used in the form just described or it can be transformed into an amorphous powder capable of being converted into a flexible, resilient, terpolyimide foam. Although not essential, it is preferred that spray drying be employed for this purpose because the liquid resin can thereby be transformed on a continuous basis and in one step into a dry powder. Also, spray drying allows for modification of the precursor in ways which can be used to vary the properties of the final product. One suitable spray drying process is described in copending application no. 186,670 filed September 12, 1980.In general that process involves the atomization of the feedstock followed by entrainment of the droplets thus formed in a swirling annulus of heated air or other gas .This produces almost instantaneous drying of the droplets.Optimum results are typically obtained by employing spray dryer chamber gas inlet temperatures in the range of 100 100 C and by so regulating the flow of material through the dryer as to limit the chamber outlet temperature of the gas to 800C. For optimum results the dried precursor is comminuted and or screened, if necessary, to a size distribution of about 300 microns X 0 before it is converted to the corresponding polyimide by microwave heating. Dry particulate precursors produced by the technique just described can be converted to polyimide foams by the free rise technique by an open mold, constrained rise technique in which spacers are employed to limit the rise of the foam or in a closed mold. Foaming curing parameters that have proven satisfactory in converting representative precursors to flexible, resilient foams are two to 55 minutes exposure to high frequency radiation in an oven operating at a frequency of 915 to 2450 mHz and at 3.75 to 15 kW power and a power output to precursor unit weight ratio of 0.6 to 1 kW kg. Preferably, dry particulate precursors are preheated before they are exposed to microwave radiation.This contributes to higher foam rise, a more homogeneous cellular structure, and a reduced scrap rate. Preheat temperatures of 121.1 to 148.90C 250 to 3000F for 2 6 minutes have been successfully employed. Steady application of the microwave energy is not required, and pulsed or cyclic exposure of the precursor to the microwave energy may even produce superior results.Typically, the duration of the microwave energy pulses and the intervals therebetween will be on the order of 60 and 20 seconds, respectively. Also, conductive fillers can often advantageously be incorporated in the precursor to promote its conversion to a polyimide by generating additional thermal energy.From 5 to 20 weight percent of activated carbon or graphite can be employed for that purpose. Another technique that can be used to advantage in making polyimide foams and artifacts including such foams by the practice of the present invention is thermal heating of the microwave cavity. Temperatures in the range of 121.1 to 232.20C 250 to 4500F are employed. Similarly, an optimum product can in many, if not most, cases be obtained by heating the substrate or mold on or in which the precursor is foamed to a temperature of 121.1 to 148.90C 250 to 3000F before the precursor is exposed to microwave energy. Also, quality may in many cases be optimized by employing different microwave energy power levels to foam the precursor and to subsequently cure the foam. For example in making flexible, resilient1 copolyimide foams from precursors of the character described above in existing equipment, a power level of 10 kW for foaming followed by one of 15 kW has been selected as optimum for terpolyimide systems, power levels of 10 and 8.4 kW were chosen . In those applications of our invention involving the free rise technique, the depth and loading of the particulate precursor on the substrate are important to the development of a stable, homogeneous structure in the foam to which the precursor is converted. The powder should be at least 0.5 cm deep. Powder loadings as low as 1.6 kg m2 have been successfully employed. However, loadings in the range of 4.3 to 15 kg m2 are preferred and loading of ca. 4.3 and 7.7 kg m2 are thought to be optimum in most cases for terpolyimide and copolyimide systems, respectively. Also, it has been found in the free rise foaming techniques that optimum yields are obtained from square shaped beds rather than those of rectangular configuration. As suggested above, it is not essential that the precursor be dried before it is foamed. In fact, the use of a liquid resin precursor can often be employed to advantage e.g., in making composite products such as reinforced panels. Another aspect of our invention, in this regard, resides in novel, improved processes for making artifacts of the type just described and others of comparable character. In one exemplary process for making panels in accord with the principles of our invention, a liquid resin precursor as described above and compounded with selected fillers is spread on glass cloth e.g., Owens Corning Style 120 wet with the resin. A second resin wetted glass cloth is placed on top the compounded resin. Solvent is removed by heating the resulting sandwich in a circulating air oven at a temperature of not more than 300 and preferably about 25O0F for 2 to 16 hours or by exposing it to microwave radiation for 2.25 to 12 minutes, typically at a power level on the order of 1.25 to 2 kW. Foaming and curing of the precursor by the open mold, constrained rise technique using the process parameters described above follows the solvent removal step and this is typically succeeded by thermal postcuring as described hereinafter. Various fillers including glass strands and microballoons can be employed in panels made by the techniques just described. From 5 to 40 weight percent of filler based on the weight of the polyimide into which the precursor is converted can be used. One exemplary combination of fillers that has proven satisfactory is 7.5 to 10 weight percent of unsized or heat cleaned, glass strands and 12.5 to 15 weight percent of glass microballoons e.g., 3M Company C 15X . In applications of our invention such as that just described the liquid resin precursor will typically be diluted with an alkyl alcohol in a ratio of 20 parts per hundred phr of resin in the case of coployimide systems and 30 phr if terpolyimide resins are involved before the filler s is added. In such cases we have found that the quality of the product is optimized by reducing the solvent content of the resin and reinforcement mixture to a level of 29 31 weight percent by thermal or microwave drying before the precursor is foamed. In the foregoing and other applications of our invention, the microwave heating step or steps can often be followed to advantage by the thermal postcure of the polyimide mentioned above. This is accomplished by heating the product of the microwave heating step in a circulating air oven at a temperature of 500 to 5500F for 30 to 200 minutes to complete the curing of the polyimide. All of the techniques for heating the precursor described above require that a substrate or mold material which is compatible with the microwave radiation be employed. In the open and closed mold techniques, the material must also have sufficient flexural strength to withstand the pressure of the expanding foam. Substrate and mold materials that have been found suitable includeRidout Plastics Company polypropylenes lined with a Teflon coated glass Taconic 7278 Pyroceram a Corning Glass crystalline ceramic made from glass by controlled nuclea tion and glass filled polyimides. Other materials possessing the necessary attributes discussed above can also be employed. From the foregoing it will be apparent to the reader that one primary object of the present invention resides in the provision of novel, improved methods of preparing polyimide foams from their precursors and for preparing artifacts containing such foams. Related, also important, but more specific objects of our invention reside in the provision of methods of the character just described which can be employed to make products as diverse as flexible, resilient foams rigid, high strength panels and molding powders which, in conjunction with the preceding object, afford ready control over the mechanical properties of the polyimides into which the precursors are converted which are relatively economical and capable of producing high quality products in high yield which can be employed to convert precursors that are mixtures of benzophenonetetracarboxylic acid esters and primary diamines to the corresponding polyimides and which make it unnecessary to handle the fragile, uncured foams generated in converting the precursors to the polyimidest which can be employed to convert both liquid resin and dry particulate precursors to polyimides as well as such precursors compounded with fillers and additives which can be used in conjunction with free rise foaming techniques and with open and closed mold techniques as well which can be employed to proudce polyimide foams and polyimide foam containing artifacts in large sizes. Another important, and primary, object of the present invention resides in the provision of novel, improved methods of manufacturing polyimide foams and foamcontaining artifacts in which microwave heating is employed to foam the precursor and to cure the foam. Related, more specific, but nevertheless important objects of our invention reside in the provision of methods for manufacturing polyimides and polyimide containing artifacts as recited in the preceding objects in which one or more of the following techniques is utilized in conjunction with microwave heating to tailor the properties or optimize the quality of the foam or artifact or to optimize the yield of foam thermal post curing of the foam preheating of the substrate or mold on or in which the precursor is foamed or cured power stepped and pulsed applications of the microwave energy to the material being processed incorporation of conductive fillers in the precursor and square shaped beds or loadings of the precursor. Other important objects and features and additional advantages of our invention will become apparent from the foregoing, from the appended claims, and as the ensuing detailed description and discussion proceeds in conjunction with the working examples in which that discussion and description is incorporated and the accompanying drawing in which Figure 1 shows the effect of preheat on a representative and important mechanical property of a polyimide prepared from its precursor by microwave heating in accord with the principles of the present invention Figure 2 shows the effect of variations in microwave energy power output on the same property Figure 3 shows how the mechanical property in question can be varied by thermally postcuring the foam and by incorporating a surfactant in the precursor and Figure 4 shows, pictorially, the differences obtained by foaming and curing one representative precursor with microwave radiation and with free rise, open mold, and closed mold techniques in accord with the principles of our invention. The working examples follow EXAMPLE I Among the polyimide systems which have been foamed and cured by the techniques disclosed herein and subsequently evaluated are 1701 1 and 1702 1, both copolyimides, and 1720 1 which is a terpolyimide. The 1702 1 precursor was prepared by adding 3,3 , 4,4 benzophenonetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride 322.2 g, 1.0 mole to 240 ml of methyl alcohol and 24 ml of H20 in a one liter, three neck flask equipped with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, and a reflux condenser. After addition, the mixture was heated and refluxed until clear.The mixturewas then ref fluxed for an additional 60 minutes to ensure complete esterification of the acid to its half ester. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 40 50 C 104 1220F . 2,6 Diaminopyridine 32.8 g, 0.3 mole and p p methylene dianiline 138.7 g, 0.7 mole were added to the half ester solution, and the mixture was heated at 60 65 C 140 1490F for five minutes. FS B surfactant was next added to the mixture in an amount of 0.1 percent based on the weight of the methyl half ester and the diamines. In some cases the liquid resin precursor this produced was converted to a dry particulate form using the spray drying technique described in copending application no. 186,670 with a spray dryer inlet temperature of 1000C, an outlet temperature of 63 70 C, and an atomizer speed of 30,000 to 32,000 rpm. The precursor was diluted with methanol in a ratio of 20 parts of the alcohol to 100 parts of resin before it was spray dried. The dried powder was collected, sieved through aNo. 48 Tyler mesh screen 297 micron diameter openings and rolled for 30 minutes in a round plastic bottle to eliminate lumps. The 1701 1 precursors liquid resin and dry powder were prepared in the manner just described from the same compounds using a 3,3 , 4,41 benzophenonetetracarboxy lic acid methyl ester 2,6 diamino pyridine p,p methylene dianiline molar ratio of 1.0 0.4 0.6. The 1720 1 terpolyimide precursors were prepared by forming the methyl half ester of 3,3 , 4,4 benzophenonetetracarboxylic acid in the manner described above. The half ester solution was cooled to 25 350C 77 950F and 2,6 diaminopyriding 32.8 g, 0.3 mole and p,p methylene dianiline 99.1 g, 0.5 mole were added and the contents of the flask mixed for 15 minutes. 1,6 Diaminohexane 23.7 g, 0.2 mole was then added at a slow enough rate to keep the reaction temperature from exceeding 650C 1490F , completing the preparation of the liquid resin. To make the dry particulate resins, FS B surfactant 0.1 weight percent was added to the liquid resin, the latter diluted with 30 phr of methyl alcohol, and the resulting liquid spray dried with the reactor operated at an inlet temperature of 100 C and outlet temperatures in the range of 69 75 C. Numerous tests we have made show that flexible resiliency polyimide foams can be produced from dry particulate precursors of the character described above by microwave heating. Those precursors and a number of variants were loaded onto appropriate substrates, placed in the microwave cavity of a 5 kW Gerling Moore Batch Cavity Model 4115 microwave oven, and exposed to microwave radiation at frequencies of 915 and 2450 mHz to foam the material by the free rise technique and, in some cases, at least partially cure it Curing was completed by heating the foam in aBlue M, circulating air, industrial oven. Foam rise, cellular structure, resiliency, striations, density, fatigue, compression set, indentation load deflection, hydrolytic stability, and flammability were determined although not all of these parameters were measured in every test. Indentation load deflection ILD is a measure of the force required to compress a polymeric foam to a specified percentage of its original thickness. ILD is accordingly indicative of the softness or seatability of a foam. Compression set is the permanent deformation obtained by subjecting a foam to a specified compressive stress load and time . Compressive set is also indicative of the seatability of a foam and, in addition, is a measure of its durability. Compression set of the foams at 90 percent compression was determined according to ASTM Standard D 1564, Method B, using two steel plates held parallel to each other by clamps with the space between the plates adjusted to the required thickness by spacers. The resistance of the foam to cyclic shear loadings fatigue test was determined in accordance withASTM Standard D 1564, Procedure B, with the exception that examination and measurement of the foam for loss of thickness was made at 10,000 and 20,000 cycles. The fatigue tester was constructed in accordance with the ASTM Standard just identified. The flammability characteristics of the foams were obtained by determination of the smoke density in accordance with the procedure for utilizing the NBS SmokeDensity Chamber see American Instrument Co., AmincoCatalog No. 4 5800, Instruction No. 941 . The relative flammabilities of the foams were determined by measuring the minimum of oxygen and nitrogen that will just support combustion of the material LOI . The test apparatus for this determination was prepared in accordance with ASTMStandard D 2863. Density tests were made in accordance with ASTMStandard D 1564, Suffix W. Density of the polyimide foam is important because most physical properties of a polymeric foam approach a straight line relationship to density. Among the important properties of which this is true are indentation load deflection and compression set. Hydrolytic tests were conducted in a controlled temperature humidity chamber Blue M for a period of 30 days at 600C 140 F and 100 percent relative humidity.

An exemplary foam made by the free rise technique described in this Example is shown at the left in Figure 4. EXAMPLE II As discussed above, the material on or in which the precursor is supported while it is exposed to microwave radiation has a marked effect on the product foam. This was confirmed by a series of tests using the test protocol described in Example I and a variety of substrates and a 1702 1 precursor.

The effects of preheat are demonstrated by a study in which the effect of preheat temperature at constant preheat time was evaluated at four different temperatures using 1701 1 precursors modified with 0.015 and 0.05 weight percent of AS 2 surfactant.These were 121.10C 2500F , 176.70C 3500F , 232.20C 4500F , and 287.8 C 5500F .

The data also indicate that the compression set properties are independent of preheat temperature when the time is kept constant. In a second part of the same study, the preheat temperature was kept constant at 2500F, and the effect of preheat time was evaluated at various time intervals. The data from this study are shown graphically in Figure 1. It is clear from that figure that preheat time does have a significant effect on the product foam. EXAMPLE IV Another above discussed variation of our basic process that can on occasion be used to advantage is to heat the cavity of the microwave oven. This was confirmed by tests in which a heated cavity was duplicated by a preheated Pyrex bell jar 38 cm in. diameter and 30 cm high placed upside down on a preheated Teflon substrate. This produced a heated cavity within the microwave cavity of theGerling Moore oven. Forty grams of 1702 1 powder precursor and the bell jar were so loaded on the substrate that the precursor was contained within the jar. Microwave power was then applied to foam the powder precursor at a predetermined cavity temperature. When the bell jar was not preheated the foam rise was very low and erratic. When foaming was preceded by preheating the bell jar and the substrate at 250 F, the foam rise was very high the cellular structure was very uniform and the foam possessed a thin glazed skin. The scrap rate of this foam was very low. When the temperature of the cavity was increased above 231.20C 450 F thermal foaming and microwave foaming occurred simultaneously and the foam structure became very poor. EXAMPLE V Still another technique that can on occasion be employed to advantage in the practice of the present invention is the incorporation of a conductive filler in the precursor. Appropriate fillers are capable of interacting with the microwave field and consequentially producing sufficient thermal energy to permit foaming and curing of polyimide precursors in a single step. A study demonstrating this was carried out by compounding 20 percent by weight of selected conductive fillers in 1702 1 precursors and then processing the resulting compositions in the Gerling Moore oven as described in Example I. The fillers were Micromesh Graphite Powder Activated Carbon Powder Titanium Dioxide Hydrated Alumina Boron Nitride Wood Resin Pelargonic Acid Graphite proved capable of producing a temperature increase of l910C 3750F and partial curing of the foams.For activated carbon the temperature increase was in excess of 315 C 6000F and possibly higher because the foams began to char . None of the other additives produced any significant thermal effect. On the basis of these findings, activated carbon was selected for further study. Precursors derived from 1702 1 resins were modified by the addition of various amounts of activated carbon and foamed by the method just described. The results of these experiments are reported in Table 7.

When large size foams were prepared by this process 600 g of precursor , foaming and curing occurred at filler concentrations as low as four to five percent. It was also determined that higher surfactant concentrations 0.3 1.0 weight percent are required to minimize cavities and other imperfections and thereby produce homogeneous foams when large size pieces of foams are produced by this conductive filler technique. EXAMPLE VI That microwave radiation frequency and power output are important in the foaming and curing of polyimides by the process we have invented was demonstrated by foaming and curing 1702 1 precursors in the microwave oven described above using the Example I procedure and a microwave frequency of 2450 inHz and by processing the same precursors in a 15 kW GFE Gerling Moore microwave oven using essentially the same procedure with a Pyroceram substrate.

It also demonstrates that both foaming and curing can be accomplished by exposure to microwave energy alone at high power outputs. Tests of the character just described were also made in a Gerling Moore microwave oven operating at a frequency of 915 mHz. The 915 mHz tests were started at a power of 10 kW with the highest foam rise at 15 to 20 kW. The 915 mHz frequency will therefore foam polyimide resin precursors but the interaction of the precursors at this frequency is not as rapid as at the 2450 mHz frequency, and foaming is more dependent on the size of the charge being processed. In the course of the power output studies it was found that pulsing of the microwave energy may also prove advantageous. This was confirmed by tests in which 1702 1 precursors modified with 0.75 weight percent of AS 2 surfactant were processed in the 15 kW microwave oven on aTeflon coated glass substrate by the free rise technique described in Example I. Pulsing was carried out by automatically and alternately switching the microwave power ON for 60 seconds and OFF for 20 seconds during the foaming and curing process. A power output of 8.4 kW for 15 minutes was used for foaming, and this was followed by a microwave radiation cure at 15 kW for 15 minutes and a thermal cure in the circulating air oven at 2430C 4700F for 1 2 hours depending upon the particular test. The foams obtained by this pulsing technique using 10 kg m2 loading possessed a very homogeneous cellular structure and were practically free of reticulation and flaws.

In the course of the tests just described it was also observed that, as a corollary, foams of higher quality were obtained from square beds than from beds with elongated configurations. EXAMPLE VIII The duration of the period for which the precursor is exposed to microwave radiation to foam or foam and cure it is also an important parameter of our process. One study in accord with the procedure of ExampleI of the effects of foaming time on foam properties was carried out using 1720 1 terpolyimide precursors containing 0.05 percent AS 2 surfactant. Foaming was at power outputs of 2.5, 3.75, and 5.0 kW. Results of this study are shown graphically in Figure 2. The data show that, for all power outputs, increased foaming time produces foams with better compression set. A foaming time of six minutes at a microwave power output of 3.75 kW appears to offer the best conditions for processing the particular terpolyimide system of this study as shown by the compression set values. Foams derived from 1720 1 terpolyimide precursors foamed at these conditions were flexible resilient and possessed a fine, homogenous cellular structure with the best compression set. The optimum time of exposure to the microwave radiation will1 of course, vary from application to application depending upon a variety of factors such as the polyimide system involved, the presence or absence of conductive fillers see Example V , the thickness and loading factor of the precursor charge, the power output, etc. For example, in foaming 8.8 kg charges of 1702 1 precursors modified with 0.02 weight percent of AS 2 surfactant, 15 minute exposures at a power output of 10 kW followed by 25 to 40 minutes exposure at a power output of 13.9 to 15 kW were employed to produce pieces of foam with dimensions as large as 72 by 76 inches and thicknesses up to 10 inches. That those foams had acceptable properties is shown by the data in Table 12 above. EXAMPLE IX Another above discussed, and important, parameter of our process is the temperature used in postcuring the polyimide foam when that technique is employed. Exemplary of many studies in which this was confirmed was one in which 600 g lots of 1701 1 powder precursors modified with 0.015 and 0.02 percent of AS 2 surfactant were foamed on Teflon substrates in the 5 kW microwave oven by the free rise technique. The foams were then thermally postcured in the circulating air oven at temperatures of 260, 288, 315 and 330 C 500, 550, 600, and 6250F . The curing times at each temperature were 30, 60, and 90 minutes. The data resulting from this evaluation are graphically presented in Figure 3. As is evident from the data, the properties of the foam of which compression set is exemplary are highly dependent on the temperature employed in the postcure cycle and on the duration of that cycle as well. The preceding examples are concerned with what we term a free rise method for converting precursors to flexible, resilient polyimide foams. As discussed above, however, constrained rise in an open or closed mold can also be employed. The following example deals with the constrained rise, open mold technique. EXAMPLE X Series 1701 1, 1702 1, and 1720 1 precursors were placed between two 1.25 cm 1 2 in thick polypropylene sheets covered with Teflon coated glass Taconic 7278 at a powder loading of 12.2 12.7 kg m2 2.5 2.6 ibsift2 . The final thickness of the foam was controlled by placing 17.8 cm 7 in polypropylene spacers between the sheets. The entire assembly was inserted in the 5 kW microwave oven and the precursor foamed for six minutes at a power output of 3.75 to 5.0 kW. The uncured foam was removed from the microwave oven and thermally postcured.

However, compression set was considerably inferior to that of foams produced by free rise techniques. A representative foam produced as described in this Example is shown in the center of Figure 4. EXAMPLE XI Closed, perforated molds were made from Tefloncoated glass, glass filled polyimide molded sheets, Pyrex glass, and polypropylene. The mold was lined with high porosity Teflon coated glass Taconic, 7278 to permit the escape of the volatiles formed during foaming. The mold was closed to produce foams to exact configurations. The process involved placing a 1701 1 precursor in the mold followed by foaming in the 5 kW microwave oven.The foams were removed from the mold after foaming and thermally postcured at 2880C 5500F for one hour. A foam produced by this technique is shown at the right in Figure 4. EXAMPLE XII We pointed out above that advantage can be taken of the present invention to produce rigid artifacts such as panels as well as flexible, resilient foams. One procedure for preparing rigid panels, which also demonstrates that our invention can be used to process liquid resin precursors as well as powders, includes the step of compounding a liquid resin precursor with selected fillers in a variable speed, ABBE double shaft mixer until the filler is thoroughly wetted. Glass cloth 120 style wetted with resin is placed on a sheet of aluminum foil.The resin mixture is spread over the cloth to a depth depending upon the density and thickness desired. The top surface of the panel is then covered with another piece of wetted glass cloth. Solvent is removed by drying the wet panel in a circulating air oven at 820C 180 F for 120 minutes or in a microwave oven until 29 31 percent of the solvent has been removed for a phr dilution ratio of 20. The aluminum foil is removed from the dried panel and the sample placed between two sheets of Teflon coated glass cloth. The dried panel is further processed by foaming and curing. Foaming of the panel is carried out in the microwave oven at a power output of 5.0 10 kW between two sheets of microwave compatible material. The samples were cured in a circulating air oven at a temperature of 287.7 C 550 F for 30 minutes and cut to the desired dimensions. Microwave drying in this and other applications of our invention involving the drying of a precursor containing a liquid resin are in general preferred. The advantages of this technique are shorter drying cycles and more even drying, which results in a superior product. Particularly in making larger panels, and also in other applications of our invention, we prefer to heat the substrate or mold prior to foaming the precursor, be it a liquid resin or dry powder. This results in greater expansion and a consequent reduction in foam dw withdrawal tests. Compression tests used the procedure described inASTM Standard C365. The apparatus was an Instron Model TMSM compression tester with a full scale load range of 500 g and a crosshead speed range of 0.05 to 10.0 cm min. Direct screw withdrawal tests used the procedure and apparatus described in ASTM Standard D 1761. Determination of the flexural strength was carried out by a modified form of MIL STD 401 using a test specimen size of approximately 7.5 x 17.5 cm 19 x 6.9 in . The burning characteristics of the rigid panels were obtained by observing flame penetration at various time intervals up to 10 minutes when the specimen was subjected to a Meker burner, by determination of the smoke density in accordance with the NBS procedure identified inExample I, and by measuring the relative flammability of the panels from determination of the oxygen index LOI . The following examples describe, in more detail, the making and evaluation of rigid polyimide foam filled panels by the process we have invented and described in the preceding paragraphs. EXAMPLE XIII A 1702 1 liquid resin modified with 2.2 weight percent of Imperial Chemical Company L 170 crosslinking agent was used to make a panel by the process described inExample XII. The filler was composed of Owens Corning type 405 glass strands which had been heated at 8000F to remove the sizing. Unsized or heat cleaned strands tend to separate into individual small diameter fibers when blended with the liquid resin. This results in a lower foam rise and a finer, higher density cellular structure. Therefore, a lower less expensive concentration of heat cleaned strands can be used.

EXAMPLE XIV Another specific procedure for making a rigid panel differs from that described generally above and from the specific procedure of the preceding example primarily by the technique employed to lay up the panel. Half of the resin and reinforcement mixture was spread on the wetted glass cloth, and this was followed by microwave drying.The remaining mixture was laid up on this layer this was followed by second stage drying. This innovation resulted in uniform solvent evolution throughout the panel and improved panel surfaces. A typical drying cycle for a 1.11 m2 12 ft2 panel was 15 minutes for the first stage followed by 30 minutes for the second stage using a power output of 10 kW. One rigid panel was produced by the technique just described using 1.59 cm .625 in thick Pyrex plates and the following process parameters.

These materials are produced from essentially the same particulate polyimide foam precursors and by the same processes used to make flexible resilient foams. Glass fibers, glass microballoons, and other additives are compounded into the powder by milling in a ball mill or by blending in a high speed blender. These compositions are foamed by microwave techniques. One thermal acoustical insulation was produced as just described by microwave processing of a 1702 1 precursor modified with 3 percent AS 2 surfactant and 20 percent Fiberfrax milled fibers. A power output of 10 kW was used for foaming, and this was followed by 20 minutes at 15 kW and heating in the circulating air oven at 287.70C 550 F to cure the insulation.
