# HOLDER FOR COSMETICS STICK

## Abstract
Recent improvements in cosmetics materials have includ ed the development of certain highly volatile binders for pow der colouring compositions, e.g. facial blushers etc. these binders can be used to retain the composition in integral stick form, and have the added advantage of possessing high slip coefficients, thus aiding application of the cosmetic to the skin. However, being highly volatile, they tend to evaporate from the stick and even in the close confines of the conventional twist stick assembly e.g. as hitherto used for lipsticks this evapora tion would quite quickly result in disintegration of the stick. The invention concerns a holder assembly for a cosmetics stick in corporating such a binder and includes a base 3, 5 which is open at one end and which has relatively rotatable inner 5 and outer 3 tubes and which houses a stick holder cup 18 ar ranged to be axially movable by relative rotation of the tubes, and a cap 2 which fits over the open end of the base. Respec tive seals 31, 41 are provided to seal between the cap and the base on the one hand, and between the cup and the inner tube on the other hand so as to inhibit egress of vapour formed with in the assembly by evaporation of the binder.
