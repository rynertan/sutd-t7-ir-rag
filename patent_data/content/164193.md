# Hybrid ac line transient suppressor.

## Abstract
An AC line transient suppressor 1 includes a first metal oxide varistor 5 connected between the hot and neutral lines 2, 3 of an AC power system. A first inductor 6 is con nected from the hot line to one terminal of a second metal oxide varistor 8 , the other terminal of which is connected to the neutral line. A second inductor 9 having approximately twice the value of the first one 6 is connected from the junction be tween the first inductor and the second metal oxide varistor 8 to a hot supply terminal 10 to which equipment to be protect ed is connected. A silicon surge suppressor 11 having a predetermined clamping voltage is coupled between the hit supply terminal 10 and the neutral line conductor. The induc tance of the first inductor has a value selected to divert approxi mately 95 of the transient surge current through the first me tal oxide varistor. The second inductor diverts approximately 65 of the remaining surge current through the second metal oxide varistor, so that only approximately 2 of the total surge current flows through the silicon junction diode suppressor 11 , allowing it to provide a low clamping voltage.
