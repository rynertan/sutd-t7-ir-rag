## Abstract
A mixture of an organosilicon compound having at least one alkoxy or alkoxyalkoxy radical per molecule, vinyltris tertiary butylperoxy silane, and organic solvent is an adhe sive primer composition useful for bonding thermosetting silicone rubber to a substrate, especially for bonding fluoro silicone rubber to a substrate. The adhesive primer composi tion can be used in a method of bonding thermosetting silicone rubber to a substrate.
