## Abstract
The invention comprises a method and apparatus for accurately calendering a web of material, such as paper. Zone control rolls of variable geometric profile are provided for a super calender at the top and bottom nips. The upper zone control roll has its geometric profile along the nip altered as a function of web caliper. The bottom zone control roll has its geometric profile altered as a function of temperature meas ured at the bottom compliant roll of the super calender.
