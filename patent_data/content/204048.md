# Crankshaft supporting and lubricating structure in plural cylinder internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
The crankshaft 13 of an engine is supported by bearing caps 8 mounted on journal walls 7 of a cylinder block B , and a bridge 9 interconnects the bearing caps. Oil passages 33 in each bearing cap lead from the bridge to each crank shaft journal bearing at a laterally offset location rather than on the cylinder axis L . A longitudinal main gallery 30 in the bridge supplies oil to the said passages and is laterally offset even further to that side. An oil supply passage 34, 35 in the bridge and one bearing cap at one extreme lateral side sup plies oil from a pressurized oil supply passage 37 in the cylinder block to the oil supply passages in the bearing caps.
