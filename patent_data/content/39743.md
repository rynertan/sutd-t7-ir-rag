# BROAD HOST RANGE RECOMBINANT PLASMID RINGS AS CLONING VEHICLE, AND THEIR PRODUCTION

## Abstract
The present invention relates to novel, broad bacterial host range small plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid rings which serve as cloning vehicles for DNA fragments, particularly those separated from other plasmid rings or from chromosones, recombined with the small plasmid rings and to the processes for recombining the plasmid rings and to processes for transferring them between host bacteria. In particular, the present invention relates to the aggregate plasmid ring RP1 pRO1600, to pRO1600 and plasmid ring derivatives thereof, particularly including pRO1601 pRO1613 and pRO1614, all of which are carried for reference purposes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15692 also known as strain PAO1c and are on deposit at the Northern Regional research Laboratories NRRL of the United States Depart ment of Agriculture at Peoria, Illinois. The plasmid ring RP1 also known as R1822 is deposited in Pseudomonas aerugin osa NRRL B 12123 and is a known plasmid ring . The pRO1600 portion of the aggregate is a new plasmid ring. The novel small plasmid rings are particularly useful for recom binant genetic manipulation wherein the DNA fragments are introduced into the plasmid rings to produce useful, cloneable characteristics in the host bacterium, particularly chemical generating characteristics.
