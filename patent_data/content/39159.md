# Vinyl halide resin compositions containing antimony based stabilizer compositions, such stabilizer compositions and processes of production thereof.

## Abstract
Shelf stable liquid antimony based stabilizer composi tions for incorporation into vinyl halide resin compositions comprise a liquid organic antimony sulphur and or oxygen containing compound, such as antimony tris isooctyl thio glycolate , and a stabilizing amount of an acidic organic com pound which may be a mercapto acid ester, mercaptan, mer captoacid, mercaptoalcohol, monocarboxylic acid or a mix ture thereof. Processes of production of such antimony based stabilizer compositions and vinyl halide resin compositions containing them are also described.
