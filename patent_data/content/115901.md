# Distortion correction for an overhead projector system.

## Abstract
An overhead projector 27 is provided which is able to project a uniformly focused image 36 of a transparency onto a vertical surface 32 at an oblique angle above the hori zontal plane without introducing keystone distortion by off setting a projection lens 28 and its associated mirror 33 from the center of a transparency stage 30 of the projector 27 in the direction of projection and directing light through the transparency and to the projection lens 28 at an angle which is equal to the oblique angle above the horizontal plane at which the image is projected. Light is directed to the projection lens 28 by offsetting the upper lens 40 of a two element circular Fresnel condensing lens system 40, 44 in the direction of displacement of the projection lens 28 .
