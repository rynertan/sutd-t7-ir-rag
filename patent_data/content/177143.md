# Intraocular lens with a vaulted optic.

## Abstract
An intraocular lens 11 , including an optic 13 having an optic body 19 , with a posterior surface and first and second circumferentially spaced spacing tabs 23 at the periphery of the optic body. Each of the spacing tabs extends radially outwardly from the periphery of the optic body and axially of the optic body in the same axial direction. A haptic 15,17 is mounted on the optic and projects generally radially out wardly of the periphery of the optic. With this construction, the intraocular lens can be implanted in the eye, with the spacing tabs in contact with the wall of the capsular bag to space the posterior surface of the optic from the wall of the capsular bag.
