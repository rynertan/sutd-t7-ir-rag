# Improvements relating to ring seals.

## Abstract
A ring seal primarily for sealing static mating faces com prises an annular jacket 1 , which may be made of low friction plastics material, having a channel of part elliptical radial pro file. Within the channel there is accommodated an energising spring 2 in the form of a ring of channel shaped radial profile there being a gap between a part M of the spring ring 2 and the channel to allow movement of the spring ring relative to the jacket when the ring seal is brought into use. The spring ring 2 is made from a transversely folded strip of metal with seg mented side edges which is formed into a circle and then has its end secured together.
