# Method and apparatus for testing petroleum wells.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for testing petroleum wells. It is highly desirable when test ing a well s potential to be able to allow the well to flow at normal flow rates and to be able to shut down the well and determine the pressure build up move after a well has been producing the normal flow rates. It is known to introduce either a drill stem test system or a tubing test system after the well has been drilled, to obtain pressure build up curves and allow the well to flow a full flow rates. In both instances packers 14 are introduced into the well on a string, testing is completed, and then the entire tool string is withdrawn from the well leaving the well dependent upon the drilling mud therein, blow out preventers, etc., to maintain control of the well until it is completed. It is, however, desirable in conjunc tion with the testing procedure to provide for shutting down of the well adjacent the production formation and to use the same well control equipment for both testing and shutting down. The present invention meets this desire by providing a well test apparatus comprising a well packer 14 having a bore extending therethrough with a sleeve type foot valve 15 having a bore therethrough, depending from said packer 14 . A tubular actuator 13 also having above extending therethrough, engages on top of the packer 14 and has an actuator member 44a which extends through the packer 14 and, can open and close the foot valve 915 . The actuator 13 also includes a pressure responsive member 44 which is exposed to pressure within and outside said actuator 13 for moving the actuator member 44a vertically in response to a differential in pressure between the inside and outside of the valve 15 , to thus open and close the foot valve 15 . The well can thus be tested at full flow rates and the actuator 13 retracted from the well leaving the packer 14 and foot valve 15 sealing the well until such time as the well is to be com pleted and production commenced.
