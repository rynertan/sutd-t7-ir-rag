# Production of carboxylic acid anhydrides and catalysts therefor.

## Abstract
Hydrocarbons, particularly n butane, are oxidised to acid anhydrides, especially maleic anhydride, by contacting them at concentrations above the flammable limit with oxygen in the presence of a vanadium phosphorus mixed oxide catalyst having a surface area of at least 10 mÂ² g. The concentration of inert gas is less than 70 molar percent and or the oxygen concentration is greater than 13 molar percent.
