# FREQUENCY CHARACTERISTIC ADJUSTING APPARATUS

## Abstract
Frequency characteristic adjusting apparatus used in sound apparatus or the like, in which an input signal is divided into first and second frequency bands after being amplified, the amplitude of the signal of the first frequency band controlled by first and second amplitude control circuits respectively, the amplitude of the signal of the second frequency band controlled by third and fourth amplitude control circuits respectively, and the output signals from the first and second amplitude control circuits added and negatively fed back to the amplifier. The output signals from the third and fourth gain control circuits are also added to form the output.
