# FULLY WETTED MECHANICAL ULTRASOUND SCANHEAD

## Abstract
A fully wetted ultrasound scanhead 10 for medical applica tions is described in which the motor 18 and the rotor 12 are enclosed within a sealed housing filled with ultrasound coupling fluid. The invention includes a drive belt 16 to drive the rotor from the motor, rather than a precision drive means. Speed adjustment means, including an encoder disk mounted on the rotor, provide feedback for an electronic speed controller. Accordingly, the speed of the motor can be adjusted as a direct consequence of the actual speed of the rotor.
