# Plastics extrusion apparatus and method of extruding plastics.

## Abstract
In plastics extrusion apparatus including a rotating screw 24 in a cylinder 12 forming a channel receiving solid mater ial and eventually expressing it through a die 20 , the channel comprising a feed zone 32 , a melting and compression zone 34 and a melt pumping zone 36 , the improvement wherein a solids decompression zone 31 is between the feed and the melting and compression zones which has increased unit volume relative to that of the feed zone, with the channel of the melting and compresion zone communicating with the feed inlet 14 through the decompression and feed zones such that solids are initially metered producing a starved condition so as to melt at substantially atmospheric pressure without filling the channel of the melting and compression zone until close to its end.
