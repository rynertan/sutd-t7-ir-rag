An example of R¹³ being a precursor of a group R¹ is when R¹³ is a nitro group. Such a group may be reduced to an amino group in conventional manner, for example via catalytic hydrogenation, for example using hydrogen gas or catalytic transfer hydrogenation. Compounds wherein R¹ is amino may be converted to compounds of the formula II wherein R¹ is C In an alternative for example R¹³ may be an isocyanate NCO group which may react with an amine of formula NHR⁶R⁷, for example in an organic aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide, at an ambient temperature. Compounds wherein R¹³ is NCO may be prepared via reaction of a corresponding amino compound with a carbonylating agent, for example N,N carbonyldi imidazole, and need not be isolated. Such agents may be reacted in conventional manner, for example in an aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide, at an ambient temperature or with cooling, for example at about 0 C. The reaction is performed in the presence of an organic base, for example triethylamine. Compounds of the formula II wherein R¹ is a group NHC NCN NHR⁸ or NHC NCN R⁹ may be formed by reacting a compound of the formula II wherein R¹ is amino with a compound of the formula L² C NCN NHR⁸ or L² C NCN R⁹ wherein L² is a leaving group such as C Compounds of the formula II wherein R¹ is carboxamido may be prepared by the hydrolysis of a corresponding compound wherein R¹ is cyano.
