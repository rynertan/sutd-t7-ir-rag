# A panel.

## Abstract
The panel 10 has a channel portion 12 along one edge which is interlockable with a portion along an opposite edge of a like panel to close the channel portion and join the two panels together in edge to edge relationship. The panel has a first hinge member 16 along the free edge of the channel portion 12 and a second complementary hinge portion 17 adjacent to but spaced from the opposite edge of the panel for co operating with a first hinge portion 16 of a like channel. The panel also has first and second formations 18 and 19 on or adjacent the channel portion and at the opposite edge of the panel, respectively. These formations 18 and 19 are snap fittably engageable with second and first formations 19 and 18 respectively of like panels when the panels are pivoted relative to one another with complementary hinge members 16 and 17 co operating, to interlock the panels together. If a double skinned structure is required projections on secondary panels 24 can be snap fitted into grooves or sockets 22 in adjacent pairs of channel portions 12 .

## Description
A PANEL This invention relates to a panel which can be inter locked with one or more like panels to make up a ceiling. side wall. roof or floor and is particularly but not exclusively applicable to the construction of bodies for goods vehicles in conjunction with devices as described in British Patent Specification 2052004B. According to the invention. there is provided a panel having a channel portion along one edge which is inter lockable with a portion along an opposite edge of a like panel to close the channel portion and join the two panels together in edge to edge relationship, a first hinge member along the free edge of the channel portion.a second complementary hinge member adjacent to but spaced from the opposite edge of the panel for co operating with a first hinge portion of a like panel.and first and second complementary formations on or adjacent to the channel portion and at the opposite edge of the panel respectively for snap fit engagement with second and first formations respectively of like paneLs when the panels are pivoted relative to one another with complementary hinge members co operating. Prefer red and or optional features of the invention are set forth in clans 2 10. One eibodfrent of the invention will nov be sore particularly described with reference to the accoipanying drawings wherein Figure 1 is a schematic view showing a plurality of panels coined together. Figure 2 is a fragmentary view on an enlarged scale showing the Joint between two adjacent panels . and Figure 3 is an exploded view of a device which can be used to join together groups of interlocked panels. Referring to the drawings. the panels 10 shown therein each have a planar portion 11 with an integral, elongate channel portion 12 along the entire length of one edge. The channel portion 12 has two sides 13 and 14 of equal dimensions and a base 15 which define in cross section the two non parallel sides and the shorter of the parallel sides of a trapezius. A first hinge member 16 in the for1 of an inwardly directed part cylindrical protrusion. is provided along the entire length of the free edge of the channel portion 12, i.e. the edge of the side 13 remote froa the base 15. An arcuate projection 9 extending over the entire length of the panel is provided adjacent to the protrusion 16 for a purpose which will be described later. A second hinge member 17. in the form of an arcuate ridge defining a part cylindrical socket or groove. is provided along the entire length of each panel adjacent to but spaced from that edge of the panel remote from the channel portion. First and second complementary formations 18 and 19 are provided on each panel at or adjacent to the junction between the planar portion 11 and the channel portion 12, and at the edge of the panel remote from the channel portion. respectively. The formations 18 and 19 each extend along the entire length of the panel. The formation 19 is of bifurcated shape and defines a two sided elongate groove. and the formation 18 is in the form of a two sided projection which is snap fittably engageable into the groove of the formation 19 on a like panel. One side 20 of the formation 18 and a portion 21 of the formation 19 are inclined at equal or substantially equal angles to the general plane of the panel to facilitate snap fit engagement. To assemble two panels together in edge to edge relationship a first panel shown unshaded in Figure 2 is for example held stationary and the hinge member 16 of a second panel shaded in Figure 2 is located in the hinge member 17 of the first panel with the first and second panels extending at an angle to one another. The second panel is then pivoted relative to the first panel during which movement the ridge 17 will extend into the channel defined between the protrustion 16 and the arcuate projection 9 until the formation 18 on the second panel snap fittably engages within the groove of the bifurcated formation 19 on the first panel. The planar portions 11 of the two panels are then co planar and flush at the joint lines. Moreover, because the formations 18 and 19 extend over the entire length of the panels the joint is resistant to the passage of liquid.The arcuate projections 9 serve to counter any force caused such as by impact or pushing which tries to unlock the joints between the panels. Secondary panels 24 may also be provided. In this case each channel portion 12 may also have on each of its sides 13 and 14 adjacent to its base 15 an elongate part cylindrical groove or socket 22 for receiving complementary elongate projections 23 on the secondary panels 24. Optionally. the secondary panels 24 may also. as shown, have at one end a flange 27. This flange extends at an acute angle to the panel i.e. at an angle which is complementary to the angle between the base 15 and side 14 of the primary panel and is provided with a hook formation 28 which engages under a corresponding hook formation 29 on one side 14 of the channel portion 12 of a primary panel 10. Advantageously, each panel 24 has therein and extending over its entire length a recess 25 see Figure 1 . with divergent sides 26. to give the panels 24 flexibility to overcome tolerance problems. If a double skinned structure is required a secondary panel can be snap fitted between a pair of adjacent channel portions 12 to be co planar with the bases 15 of the channel portions 12 and flush with the channel portions 12 at the joint lines. Moreover, if desired an insulating medium could be interposed between the panels 10 and secondary panels 24. The panels 10 and 24 will normally be formed by extrusion and from aluminium or possibly from plastics material. Typically. each panel 10 may be a 100mm wide, 1.3mm thick and 2.5 metres long. In this case each channel portion 12 may be 15mm deep, 15mm wide at its wider end, and 10mm wide at its base. As described above, the hinge members 16 and 17, formations 18 and 19 sockets 22 and formations 29 extend over the entire length of the panel. However, it will be appreciated that this may not be essential.Moreover, other modifications may be made to the panel without departing from the scope of the invention defined by the appended claims. The above described panels can be used in conjunction with devices as described in British PatentSpecification 2052004B, whereby groups of interlocked panels can be joined together to make up inter alia bodies for goods vehicles. A device as disclosed in British PatentSpecification 2052004B is shown in Figure 3 and comprises first and second sections 31 and 32, respectively which, when connected together, provide recesses for receiving the edges of groups of interlocked panels. The section 31 is elongate and a plurality of inch shorter sections 32 are adapted to be connected to the section 31 in spaced relationship along the longitudinal extent of section 31. However, the sections 32 could be of the same length as the corresponding sections 31. Each section 31, 32 has two wall portions 33 and 34, 35 and 36 adapted to lie substantially parallel to the groups of interlocked panels to be joined and a connection member between the wall portions. Each connection member includes two spaced limbs 37 and 38, 39 and 40. the two limbs 39 and 40 of the section 32 being adapted to be inserted into a recess 41 formed between the two limbs 37 and 38 of the other section 31. Each limb of the section 32 is provided with a series of serrations 42 engageable with a series of serrations 41 provided on a respective one of the limbs of the section 31. The limbs 37 and 38 of the section 31 are substantially rigid per se and the limbs 39 and 40 of the section 32 diverge before insertion and are resilient, so that upon insertion they are pressed together and cause their associated wall portions to be pushed into clamping contact with surfaces of the panels.An elongate strip 43 may be snap fitted onto the sections 32. Moreover, three such devices can be connected together to extend in mutually perpendicular directions by corner joints as disclosed in British Patent Application No. 2092699A. In order to construct a vehicle body a cuboidal framework structure can be assembled from sections 31 and the corner joints referred to above. Panels 10 are then interlocked together consecutively from within the vehicle body. while previously interlocked panels are firmly held against the wall portions 33, 34 of the section 31 by sections 32. The design of the panels and in particular the arrangement of the pivot axis enables panels to be interlocked in this way with the channel portions 12 on the inside of the vehicle. When constructing vehicle bodies in this way, it is advantageous to employ secondary panels 24 in order to ensure a constant thickness of the panel assembly where the latter is held between the sections 31 and 32.Alternatively strips of similar cross section to the panels 24 could be employed at the ends of the panels 10 between adjacent pairs of channel portions 12.Moreover, a channel member of similar cross section to the channel portions 12 should be connected along the one edge of the panel assembly, or, alternatively, packing could be employed. If. owing to their length, sore or all of the panel assemblies have too much flexibility suitable reinforcing members can be included.
