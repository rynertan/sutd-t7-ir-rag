# Printing apparatus for insertion machines.

## Abstract
A printer apparatus for a document handling machine is adapted to obtain a signal from a series of information bearing marks on a first document and transmit that signal to the control device for the printer apparatus to initiate the printing of an image such as a bar code on a second document which is to be furnished in a mailing envelope along with the first document. The printer apparatus auto matically removes the second document from a hopper, advances the second document to a printing station, lowers a print head module to the printing station over the second document, and delivers the imprinted second document to the transport raceway of a document insertion machine.
