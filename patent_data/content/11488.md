## Description
heat Bonded PaperThis invention relates to heat bonded paper webs made from a blend of natural cellulosic fibres and synthetic thermoplastic fibres.Paper webs have traditionally been formed from cellulosic fibres derived from various materials of vegetable origin, for example woodpulp. Where it is desirable for the web to be susceptible to heat treatment, it has been proposed to incorporate a proportion of synthetic thermoplastic fibres in the web. Originally, chopped staple fibres were proposed for this purpose. However, such fibres are unfibrillated and incapable of hydrogen bonding, and thus they are inherently unsuited to the production of strong paper webs. With the exception of one or two speciality products therefore, the inclusion of chopped staple fibres in paper webs has not been widespread.In recent years, so called synthetic woodpulp fibres have become available. These fibres are produced specially for use in papermaking, and have a gross morphology i.e. length diameter ratio and diameter of the same order of magnitude as cellulosic papermaking fibres derived from woodpulp.They also resemble cellulosic fibres in being fibrillated to a considerable extent, and they thus permit stronger webs to be obtained than is the case with chopped staple fibres. Examples of commercially available synthetic woodpulps are SIP supplied by Crown Zellerbach, Pulpex supplied by Solvay, and Ferlosa supplied by Montedison, all of which are polyethylenic. Fibres of other polyolefins may be used.Although synthetic woodpulp fibres produce reasonably strong paper webs when blended with cellulosic fibres, it is frequenUlg desirable to heat the web after it has becn made to softell tbe th ioplastic material and thus to enhance the strength of the web by increasing the extent of interfibre bonding.It has now surprisingly been found that the tear strength, tensile strength and stretch properties of a heat bonded paper web made from a blend of cellulose fibres and synthetic thermoplastic fibres may be considerably enhancedby including a resinous additive in the paper web before heat bonding.According to the invention therefore, there is provided a heat bonded paper web comprising cellulosic fibres and synthetic thermoplastic fibres characterised in that the web also contains a resinous additive.The resinous additive may be a synthetic or a natural material. An example of a suitable natural resin is rosin.Suitable synthetic resins include materials sold as wetstrength resins for paper, for example aminoplast resins such as melamine formaldehyde resin and urea formaldehyde resin.Melamine formaldehyde resin is particularly preferred in this specification, the expression resin comprehends not only polymers having a large number of repeating units, but also so called prepolymers or pre condensates which have only a relatively small number of repeating units . Other materials which may be used include polyamine resins, such as epichlorohydrin modified polyamine or polyamidepolyamine resins, polyethylene imine resins, and the resins sold as Kymene by Hercules Powder Company and 1,Nopcobond byDiamond Shamrock Corporation.The amount of resinous additive to be used is of the order of a few per cent, based on the total weight of the paper. Above a certain 7c. addition, the improvement in properties after heat bonding levels oif. For melamine formaldehyde resin, opti0ufli results ale achieved with additions of at least 2 ,. The relative proportions of cellulosic and synthetic thermoplastic fibres in the web may vary widely. Enhanced properties are obtained for example at 25 , 50 and 75 synthetic contents. Preferably however, the amount of synthetic fibres is from about 30 to about 50 based on the total fibre content. The type of cellulosic pulp used is not critical.. Bleached or unbleached softwood or hardwood kraft pulps may for example be used.In the case of a cross linkable resin, such as a crosslinkable melamine formaldehyde resin, a pre heating step may be carried out to cure the resin before heat bonding at a higher temperature is carried out.The resinous additive may be incorporated in the web by methods normally used in the paper industry for the inclusion of additives. Beater addition is preferred.The furnish should be relatively free beaten if it is desired to achieve an especially stretchable product.Heat bonding may be carried out by conventional techniques such as passage round a heated roller or passage through a heating tunnel.The present invention is applicable to the manufacture of products for a range of uses, but is particularly suited to the manufacture of base paper for bookbinding. Such paper needs to have good tear strength and tensile strength, and to be capable of stretching to a considerable degree. It is also desirable that it should be capable of easily accepting an emboss, for example a simulated leather emboss. Such papers are conventionally made from latex containing wholly cellulosic webs. The present invention thus makes it possible to dispense with the need to incorporate latex into the paper making furnish or with the need for a separate saturation step. The invention will now be illustrated by the following examples, in which all percentages are by weight, and the synthetic fibres in every case were polyolefin fibres EXAMPLE 1Four sets of laboratory handsheets of substance 100 g, 2 were prepared using a 50 woodpulp 50 synthetic furnish the woodpulp was a bleached softwood kraft pulp . One set contained no additives, the second a 2 Kymene resin addition, the third a 2 melamine formaldehyde addition, and the fourth a 2 rosin addition. The melamine formaldehyde and rosin additions were made in the presence of alum. The tear strength, tensile strength and stretch properties were then determined. The sheets were then heat bonded in a laboratory oven for a period of 3 minutes at a temperature of 160 0C. The tear strength, tensile strength and stretch properties were then re measured.

EXAl2LE 3This demonstrates that the melamine formaldehyde additive may be pre heated to cure the resin before heat bonding treatment is carried out. The procedure involved taking some of the 2 MF handsheets prepared for Example 2 above and stoving them in an oven at 105 C for ten minutes before carrying out the three minute heat treatment at 160 C.The results obtained were as follows Tear Strength 1320 mN Tensile Strength 25.0 N 15 mm Stretch 13.6It will be seen that although these results are marginally worse than obtained with a 2 MF addition without stoving, they represent a significant improvement on the values obtained without any additive. EXAMPLE 4This illustrates the effect of changing the relative proportions of cellulosic and synthetic fibres in the sheet.100 g mÃª handsheets containing 3 MF were prepared from furnishes containing 75 , 50 , 25 and 0 synthetic fibres.The sheets were heat bonded in a laboratory oven at 160 0C for 3 minutes, and the tear strength, tensile strength and stretch properties were measured.
