# METHOD TO ENSURE THE COOLING OF ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS FIXED ON A MULTILAYER FOR PRINTED CIRCUITS AND MULTILAYER REALIZED ACCORDING TO SAID METHOD

## Abstract
The method ensures the cooling of electronic com ponents CE fixed on a multilayer 1 , with at least a metal layer 3 interposed between insulating layers 11 , through successive steps for the obtaining of seats or cavities 13 or through holes 31 with metallized surface, the seats or cavi ties 13 having the bottom formed by said metal layer 3 and the through holes 31 being formed in the vicinity of the same seats the cooling of the component CE is achieved by heat conduction along said metal layer 3 , or by dissipator means 21, 23 located outside the multilayer and in thermal conductivity connection with said metal layer 3 .
