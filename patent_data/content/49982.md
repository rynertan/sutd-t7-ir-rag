## Description
NOVEL ELASTIC FIBERS, AN ASSEMBLY THEREOF, AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF SAID ASSEMBLY This invention relates ts novel elastic fibers, an assembly of said fibers, and a process for producing said assembly. More specifically, it relates to novel elastic fibers having improved elastic properties and composed ot at least two thermoplastic polymers, an assembly of said fibers, and a process for producing said assembly. Spandex filaments made from a polyurethane elastomer and elastic filaments made from a polyester elastomer have been known as fibers having excellent elastic recovery. Elastic fibers which develop elasticity by an entropy mechanism, such as fibers of poly urethane elastomers or polyester elastomers, have the defect that they have a very low initial modulus of elasticity and a rubber like feel, and tend to block, and when used at low temperatures, their elastic recovery and elongation abruptly decrease. Furthermore, because of their blocking tendency, these entropically elastic fibers are not spinnable on a spinning frame. On the other hand, polypivalolactone fibers see U. S. Patents Nos. 3,299,171 and 3,776,9y7 , polybutene 1 fibers see U. S. Patents Nos. 3,686,385 and 3,840,510 , poly epsilon capramide fibers see U. S.Patent No. 3,513,110 , polyoxymethylene fibers seeU. S. Patent No. 3,551,363 , and polypropylene fibers U. S. Patents Nos. 3,256,258 3,323,190 3,485,906 3,377,415 and 3,432,590 are known as elastic fibers having a high initial modulus of elasticity. Productivity of these fibers, however, is very low because they are produced by a method which comprises melt spinning a polymer, and subjecting the resulting filaments, either as such or after being drawn at a low ratio, to dry or wet heat treatment or pressurizing treatment for a long period of time. These elastic fibers develop elasticity by a crystal elasticity mechanism as contrasted to the aforesaid entropy elasticity mechanism, and have a very high initial modulus of elasticity. Accordingly, these fibers are called hard elastic fibers see J.Macromol. Sci,Phys. B8 1 2 , 157 1973 and Colloid BR Polymer Sci. 253, 824 839 1975 . Although these crystalline elastic fibers are excellent in that they retain elastic properties at low temperatures in the same way as at room temperature unlike the aforesaid entropical elastic fibers, their excessively high initial modulus of elasticity and low elongation make them unsuitable for apparel applications To the best of the knowledges of the present inventors, elastic fibers which stand between the entropically elastic fibers and the hard elastic fibers and can find extensive uses, especially those having excellent elastic recovery, a moderate initial modulus of elasticity and a moderate elongation, have not been provided to date It is an object of this invention therefore to provide novel elastic fibers having improved elastic properties and composed of at least two thermoplastic polymers. Another object of this invention is to provide novel elastic fibers having a moderate initial modulus of elasticity and a moderate elongation. Still another object of this invention is to provide novel elastic fibers having excellent elastic recovery. Yet another object of this invention is to provide novel elastic fibers having reduced blocking tendency and excellent hand. A further object of this invention is to providenovel elastic fibers which have excellent spinnability on a spinning frame and are useful as apparel materials. A further object of this invention is to provide novel elastic fibers which exhibit excellent elastic properties even at low temperatures. A further object of this invention is to provide an assembly of elastic fibers having the aforesaid improved elastic properties. A further object of this invention is to provide a process for producing elastic fibers having the improved elastic properties, or an assembly thereof, from at least two thermoplastic polymers. An additional ob,teat of this invention ifs to provide elastic fibers having he aforesaid improved elastic properties, or an assembly thereof, from at least two thermoplastic polymers by melt spinning and heat treatment of as spun fibers with high productivity. These objects and advantages are achieved in accordance with this invention by elastic fibers having improved elastic properties, characterized by the fact that a said elastic fibers are composed of at least two thermoplastic polymers, b at least one of said thermoplastic polymers has crystallinity capable of forming a row structure, c at least one other of said thermoplastic polymers has crystallinity capable of forming lamellar crystals, and d said elastic fibers have a row structure. Elastic fibers composed of at least two thermoplastic polymers have not been known heretofore as stated above. It is known that elastic fibers composed of a thermoplastic polymer having crystallinity capable of forming a row structure, such as polypropylene or polyoxymethylene, have a row structure in which lamellar crystals generated by folding bof polymer molecule chains are stacked in the direction ofC axis see J. Macromol. Sci. Phys., B1, 41, 1967 and J. Macromol. Sci. Phys., B5, 591, 1971 .These elastic fibers having such a row structure are believed to be crystalline elastic fibers which develop elasticity by a mechanism wherein lamellae or lamellar bundles are opened by the effect of interconnecting tie molecules present between the lamellae or lamellar bundles, as Clark et al. show by a schematic diagram E, S. Clark, C. A. Garber, Int. J. Polymeric Materials, 1, 31 1971 . For this reason, mixing of a polymer giving such crystalline elastic fibers with another polymer would be considered to hamper the formation of lamellar crystals and consequently a row structure and to be undesirable for production of elastic fibers. Surprisingly, it has now been found in accordance with this invention that by using a combination of a thermoplastic polymer having crystallinity capable of forming a row structure and another thermo plastic polymer having crystallinity capable of forming lamellar crystals, the formation of a row structure is not hampered but is rather promoted to give elastic fibers having improved elastic properties. The process for producing the4 elastic fibers of this invention is first described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS Figure l a is a schematic view of a wire mesh which is one example of a mesh spinneret used in the production of the elastic fibers of the invention Figure l b is a partial longitudinal sectional view of Figure l a Figure 2 is a rough sketch of one example of an apparatus suitable for the production of the elastic fibers of the invention Figure 3 is a generalized schematic view of any arbitrary longitudinal section of a mesh spinneret used in the process of this invention Figure 4 is a schematic longitudinal sectional view of one example of a die used in the production of the elastic fibers of the invention Figure 5 is a photograph of a section of a molten polymer in Example 29 in which polymer b and polymer c form. relatively large blocks when they reached the mesh spinnert Figure 6 is a photograph showing a section of one example of conjugate elastic fibers in which polymer b and polymer c respectively form relatively large polymer phases in the cross section of the fibers Figure 7 is a photograph of a section of elastic fibers in which polymer b and polymer c are finely dispersed in the cross section of the fibers Figures 8 a and respectively 8 b area broad angleX ray photographs of the elastic fibers obtained in Comparative Example 1 and Example 12 and Figures 9 a and 9 b are electron microphotographs of the surface of the elastic fibers obtained in Example 24, which respectively show the crystals of the row structure MANUFACTURING APPARATUS AND PROCESS The elastic fibers of this invention can be produced by using any spinning apparatuses. for melt spinning. For example, the elastic fibers can be produced by a known method which comprises melt extruding at least two thermoplastic polymers, either as a mixture or as conjugate fibers, from uniform regularly shaped orifices provided at certain intervals in a spinnert.According to this invention, the elastic fibers can be produced by heat treating the as spun fibers me elastic fibers of the invention provided by the above known spinning and the heat treatment have a uniform and fixed cross sectional shape conforming to the geometric configuration of the orifices. In the production of the elastic fibers of the invention by the above process, it is desirable to perform the spinning at a take up speed of about 10 to about 200 m min. and a draft ratio of about 10 to about 100 while quenching the filaments as much as possible, although these conditions may vary depending upon the types of the polymers used. According to the above process, it is relatively difficult, in comparison with a process to be described, to produce the elastic fibers of the invention having the desired improved elastic properties by heattreatment of the resulting as spun fibers0 This is presumably because according to the aforesaid spinning method, the quenching is relatively difficult, and a longer period of time is needed to heat treat the resulting as spun fibers than as spun fibers obtained by the process to be described below using a mesh spinneret when it is desired to impart the desired elastic properties. In addition, the aforesaid process apparently has low productivity. Accordingly, the aforesaid process is not so recommendable for production of the elastic fibers of the invention. According to the process of this invention, it is preferred that at least two thermoplastic polymers be extruded as a combined polymer melt through a mesh spinnert having many closely arranged small openings having an opening ratio a , represented by the following formula, of at least about 10f, EMI6.1 wherein Va is the total apparent volume of the spinneret which is taken within a unit area of its mesh portion, and Vf is the total volume of partitioning members defining the small openings which is taken within a unit area of the mesh portion of the spinneret, and converted into fine streams. The spinneret used in this invention includes many closely arranged small openings defined by the opening ratio a . In the above formula defining the opening ratio, the mesh portion of the spinneret denotes that portion of the spinneret which is mesh like. So long as the spinneret used in this invention includes many closely arranged small openings defined by the above opening ratio, there is no particular restriction on the shape of the small openings, and the shapes of the partitioning members defining the small openings. Accordingly, the mesh spinneret used in this invention may have a circular, elliptical, triangular, tetragonal, or polygonal shape, or the partitioning members defining the small openings may have depressions and elevations. Figure l a of the accompanying drawings illustrate a typical example of the mesh spinneret used in this invention. The illustrated mesh spinneret is a plain weave wire mesh, and its cross section is shown inFigure 1 b. In the plain weave wire mesh illustrated in the drawings, a small opening is of a tetragonal shape and a partitioning member defining this small opening has a depression through which a combined polymer melt extruded from the small opening moves toward and away from a combined polymer melt extruded from an adjacent small opening. The mesh spinneret used in this invention may also be an etched porous plate made by providing many small openings on a thin metallic plate by an elaborate etching technique. The etched porous plate has many small openings of a trilobal shape and a partitioning member present between adjacent small openings has a depression. The mesh spinneret used in this invention may also be a twill weave wire mesh, or a thin sintered body obtained by sintering many minute metallic balls so as to form many small openings. A part of the mesh spinneret used in this invention is disclosed inEuropean Publication No. 0017423 A. The mesh spinneret used in this invention may be used singly or as a laminated assembly The spinneret used in this invention is preferably a mesh spinneret having many small openings defined by partitioning members of small width having elevations and depressions on its polymer extruding surface, said small openings being such that the combined polymer melt extruded through one small opening of the spinneret can move toward and away from the combined polymer melt extruded from another small opening adjacent to said one opening or vice versa through depressions of the partitioning members. In the above formula defining the opening ratio a of the mesh spinneret used in this invention,Va is the total apparent volume of the spinneret which is taken within a unit area of its mesh portion and Vf is the total volume of partitioning members defining the small openings which is taken within a unit area of the mesh portion of the spinneret. Again, as is seen from Figures l a and l b, the total apparent volume Va is defined as a volume formed by two phantom planes of a unit area 1 cm2 which contact the front and back surfaces of the spinneret. In practice, the. Va value of a certain mesh spinneret can be simply determined by measuring the thickness of the spinneret by means of a dial gauge having a contact surface of 1 cm2 in area. The Vf value of a certain mesh spinneret can be determined by cutting it to a predetermined area, and for example, submerging it in a liquid, and measuring the resulting volume increase. Vf is a value obtained by converting the increased volume for each cm2 of the spinneret. Since the opening ratio a is expressed by the following formula EMI9.1 it will be undertsood that if a 1 cm2 area of the splnne ret is used as a standard in determined Va and Vf, the value showing Va is the value representing the thickness of the mesh spinneret as illustrated in Figure 1 b. The mesh spinneret used in this invention has an opening ratio alpha of about 20 to about 90 . Furthermore, the mesh spinneret used in this invention preferably has at least 5, more preferably about 10 to about 10,000, especially preferably about 100 to about 1,000, small openings per cm2. Furthermore, the mesh spinneret used in this invention has a thickness of preferably not more than 10 mm, more preferably about 0.1 to about 5 mm, especially preferably about 0.2 to about 2 mm. Advantageously, there is used in accordance with this invention a spinneret having the aforesaid structure in which the average distance P between extrusion openings for the polymer melt on the surface of its fiber forming area is in the range of 0.03 to 4 mm.Especially advantageously, there is used a spinneret having an extrusion surface with fine elevations and depressions and numerous small openings for polymer which have 1 an average distance p between small openings of 0.03 to 4 mm, 2 an average hill height h of 0.01 to 3.0 mm, 3 an average hill width a of 0.02 to 1.5 mm, and 4 a ratio of the average hill height h to the average hill width a , h a , of from 0.3 to 5.0. The fiber forming area, average distance p between small opening, average hill height h , average hill width iq and small openings as referred to above are defined below. The average distance p between small openings, average hill height E , average hill width a , etc. defined in this invention are determined on the basis of the concept of geometrical probability theory. Where the shape of the surface of the fiberforming area is geometrically evidence, they can be calculated mathematically by the definitions and techniques of integral geometry. For example, with regard to the fiber forming area of a spinneret in which sintered ball like objects with a radius of r are most closely packed, the following values are obtained theoretically. P . r, n 4r, d 2 r. Thus, these parameters can be theoretically determined in a spinneret whose surface is composed of an aggregation of microscopic uniform geometricallyshaped segments. Where the spinneret has a microscopically non uniform suriace shape, p, h, and a can be determined by cutting the spinneret along some perpendicular sections, or taking the profile of the surface of the spinneret by an easily cuttable material and cutting the material in the same manner, and actually measuring the distances between small openings, hill heights, and hill widths.In measurement, an original point is set at the center of the fiber forming area, and six sections are taken around the original point at every 300 and measured.From this, approximate values of p, h, and a can be determined. For practical purposes, this technique is sufficient. The fiber forming area, as used in this invention, denotes that area of a spinneret in which a fiber bundle having a substantially uniform density is formed.The spinneret is , for example, the one shown at 7 inFigure 2 for preparing a fiber bundle by extruding a molten polymer. The small opening in the spinneret denotes the first visible minute flow path among polymer extruding and flowing paths of a spinneret, which can be detected when the fiber forming area of the spinne ret is cut by a plane perpendicular to its levelled surface microscopically smooth phantom surface taken by levelling the surface with fine elevations and depressions the cut section thus obtained will be referred to hereinbelow simply as the cut section of the fiber forming area , and the cut section is viewed from the extruding side of the surface of the fiberforming area. Figure 3 shows a schematic enlarged view of an arbitrarily selected cut section of the general fiber forming area in this invention. In Figure 3, Ai and Ail represent the small openings. The distance between the center lines of adjoining small openings Ai and Ai is referred to as the distance P. betweenthe small openings. The average of Pi values in all cut sections is defined as the average distance p between small openings. That portion of a cut section located on the right side of, and adjacent to, a given extrusion Ai in a given cut section which lies on the extruding side of the surface of the fiber forming area from the A.portion is termed hill Hi annexed to A The distance hi from the peak of hill Hi to the levelled surface of is referred to as the height of hill Hi. The average of hi values in all out sections is defined as the average hill height E. The width of the hill Hi interposed between the small openings A. and Aj 1 which is parallel to the levelled surface of the spinneret Hi is referred to as hill width di. The average of di values in all cut sections is defined as average hill width a. In accordance with the above definitions, the spinneret in accordance with this invention is advantageously such that its polymer molding area, i.e. fiber forming area, has a surface with fine elevations and depressions and numerous small openings which meet the following requirements. 1 The. average distance p between small openings is in the range of 0,03 to 4 mm, preferably 0.03 to 1.5 mm, especially preferably 0.06 to 1.0 mm. 2 The average hill height h is in the range of 0.01 to 3.0 mm, preferably 0.02 to 1.0 mm. 3 The average hill width a is in the range of 0.02 to 1.5 mm, preferably 0.04 to 1.0 mm. 4 The ratio of the average hill height h to the average hill width a , h d, is in the range of from 0.3 to 5.0, preferably from 0.4 to 3.0. More advantageously, in addition to prescrib ing the values of p, h, a and h E within the aforesaid ranges 1 to 4 , the structure of the spinneret surface is prescribed so that the value p E p is in the range from 0.02 to 0.8, preferably from 0.05 to 0.7. The value p p, represents the ratio of the area of a small opening within the fiber forming area. The characteristic of the process of this invention is that the extrusion of molten thermoplastic polymers is carried out while generating Joule heat in the partitioning members of the mesh portion and cooling the vicinity of the extrusion surface of the spinneret with a cooling fluid Accordingly, the partitioning members of the spinneret used in this invention are composed of a conductor material. Examples of the material are metallic elements such as platinum, gold, silver, copper, titanium, vanadium, tungsten, iridium, molybdenum, palladium, iron, nickel, chromium, cobalt, lead, zinc, bismuth, tin and aluminum alloys such as stainless steel, nichrome, tantalum alloy, brass, phosphor bronze, andDuralmine and non metallic conductors such as graphite. In order to generate Joule heat in the partitioning members of the spinneret, an electric current is directly passed through the spinneret as illustrated in Figure 2. Joule heat may be generated in the partitioning members of the spinneret by directly passing an electric current through the spinneret as illustrated in Figure 2, or passing an electric current through a coil provided in the inside die of the spinneret to generate an eddy current. The current to be passed may be a direct current or alternate current in the case of direct supply, but in the case of generating the eddy current, it is an alternate current. According. to the process of this invention, it is advantageous to supply a current directly to the spinneret because this permits simplification of the structure of the spinning apparatus. Usually, a current of 0.1 to several hundred amperes is directly passed through the spinneret, or an electric field of 0.1 to several tens of volts cm is applied to generate an eddy current. Thus, preferably ah energy in an amount of about 0.5 to about 5,000 watts per cm2 of the spinneret is imparted. According to the process of this invention in which Joule heat is generated from the partitioning members defining the small openings of the spinneret, heat is instantaneously supplied to the thermoplastic polymers at least during its passage through the small openings in contrast to a process in which no heat is generated at the spinneret. As a result, the viscosity, temperature, etc.of the polymer melt at the extrusion surface of the spinneret can be controlled to suitable ranges so that the polymer melt can be smoothly separated from the extrusion surface and converted into fine streams. Since according to the spinneret used in this invention, the polymer melt can be converted to fine streams while supplying a cooling fluid, such as air, to the extrusion surface of the spinneret or its vicinity, the solidification length can be shortened, and the polymer melt can be continuously converted into fine streams stably. Thus, according to the process of this invention, the solidification can be shortened, and the temperature of the fine streams can be reduced abruptly from a high temperature Accordingly, the process of this invention has the advantage that by short heat treatment, it can provide as spun fibers which have crystals grown so that the C axis of the crystals of the row structure can easily extend in the axial direction of the fibers, and which can give the elastic fibers of the invention in which the C axis of the crystals of the row structure extends substantially in the axial direction of the fibers for example, as spun fibers produced under optimum spinning conditions give the elastic fibers of the invention having improved elastic properties by heat treatment for a time period of as short as not more than 1 second . As can be understood from the above description, the objects and advantages of the invention stated hereinabove can be advantageously achieved by the present invention. In the process of this invention, the amount of the polymer melt extruded can be adjusted to about 0.1 to about 20 g min per cm2, of the mesh spinneret. It is indeed surprising that according to the process of this invention, fine streams of the polymer melt can be more stably spun by turning the extruding surface of the spinneret upwardly so that the normal vector of the extrusion surface is reverse to the direction of gravity and taking up the fine streams extruded from the extrusion surface against gravity this process is referred to herein as an upward spinning The spinnert used in the process of this invention is a mesh spinnert having many closely arranged small openings defined by an open ratio a of at least about 10 preferably about 20 to about 90 , and preferably a mesh spinneret having many small openings defined by partitioning members of mall width having elevations and depressions on its polymer extruding surface, said small openings being such that the polymer melt extruded through one small opening of the spinneret can move toward and away from the polymer melt extruded from another small opening adjacent to said one opening or vice versa through depres sions of the partitioning members. Since the spinneret used in this invention has many closely arranged small openings, the polymer melts extruded from adjacent small openings can move toward and away from each other. In particular, when the partitioning members defining the adjacent small openings have a depressed portion, the polymer melts can more readily move toward and away from each other through the depressed portion. Desirably, the upward spinning process of this invention is carried out by turning the extrusion surface of the mesh spinneret upwardly such that the normal vector of the extrusion surface agrees completely with the direction of a vector which is quite reverse to the direction of gravity t , or is different from it by only about several degrees. The take up direction of the fine streams extruded from the extrusion surface in the upward spinning may be the same as, or deviated by an angle of up to about 30 degrees at most from, the normal vector direction of the extrusion surface. According to the upward spinning process of this invention, the solidification length of the molten polymer can be made shorter than in the case of spinning it by using a spinneret whose extrusion surface is turned in the direction of gravity. The degree of the decrease of the solidification length differs depending upon the type of the polymer, the viscosity of the molten polymer, etc. Among polymers of the same type, the solidification length of a polymer having lower viscosity can generally be made shorter. It is easy to shorten the solidification length by not more than about logo. Thus, according to the upward spinning process, the temperature of fine streams which have left the spinneret can be abruptly decreased over a shorter distance within a shorter period of time. It is easy therefore to product as spun fibers which can be easily converted into the elastic fibers of the invention by heat treatment. The aforesaid spinning process using a spinneret to be heated by Joule heat and the upward spinning process are described in detail inCopending European Patent Application No.81303726.4 having the same inventorship as the present application. In the process of this invention at least two different thermoplastic polymers are used. At least one of them has crystallinity capable of forming a row structure this polymer is referred to hereinbelow as a polymer b , and at least one other of them has crystallinity capable of forming lamellar crystals this polymer is referred to hereinbelow as a polymer c . Since the row structure is composed of lamellar crystals formed by folding of polymer molecule chains, the polymer b is embraced within the definition of the polymer c . Examples of preferred polymers b used in this invention include isotactic polypropylene, polybutene l, poly 4 methylpentene 1 , ply 3 methylbutene 1 , poly epsilon capramide , poly hexamethylene adpamide , polyoxymethylene, polyethylene sulfide, polytetramethylene terephthalate, polypivalolactone, and mixtures thereof.

Examples of the glycols having 2 to 6 carbon atomS are ethylene glycol, tetramethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and hexamethylene glycol. The aromatic polyester hard segment may also contain such a component as 2,2 bis hydroxyethoxyphenyl methane, bisphenols, hydroxycaproic acid and hydroxyethoxybenzoic acid. Examples of such aromatic polyesters are polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene terephthalate, polytetramethylene terephthalate and polyhexamethylene terephthalate Aliphatic polyethers or aliphatic polyesters having a second order transition point of not more than OOC are preferred as the soft segment. The aliphatic polyethers preferably have a carbon oxygen atom ratio of.from 1.8 1 to 4.5 1, and the aliphatic polyesters are preferably polyesters derived from aliphatic dicarboxylic acids having 4 to 12 carbon atoms and aliphatic diols having 2 to 12 carbon atoms, or polyesters composed of aliphatic hydroxycarboxylic acids having 4 to 12 carbon atoms. Preferred polyester elastomers are polyester elastomers whose hard segment is a polyalkylene tere or iso phthalate having polytetramethylene glycol as a part of the glycol component, for example the one derived from polytetramethylene glycol preferably having an average molecular weight of about 1,000 to about 3,000 and at least one of C2 C4 alkylene glycol such as ethylene glycol, trimethylene glycol and tetramethylene glycol preferably, tetramethylene glycol as the glycol component and terephthalic acid or both terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid as the acid component.Of these, polyester elastomers containing a polyester derived from polytet ramethylene glycol and tetramethylene glycol as the glycol component and terephthalic acid or both terephthalic acid and iso phthalic acid as the acid component are especially preferred. The polyester elastomer especially preferably contains polytetramethylene glycol in a proportion of about 5 to 70 by weight The aforesaid polyethylene terephthalate has an intrinsic viscosity, measured at 250C in o chloro phenol, of about 0.5 to about 1.2. The aforesaid polyurethane is preferably the one obtained by polyaddition reaction of the aliphatic polyether or polyester described hereinabove as examples of the soft segment of the polyester elastomer and an aliphatic diol having 2 to 6 carbon atoms with a dlisocyanate compound, for example, 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 4,4 dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate. The ionomer as the polymer c is suitably the one obtained by polymerizing an alpha olefin and a carboxyl containing ethylenic monomer and crosslinking the resulting copolymer with a metal ion through the carboxyl group. Preferably, it has a melt index of 0.5 to 20, and a melting point of 80 to 110 C. Especially preferred is a copolymer of ethylene and methacrylic acid which is crosslinked with a sodium ion or a zinc ion, the latter beingmost preferred. Isotactic polypropylene, polyoxymethylene and polytetramethylene terephthalate are preferred among the polymers b . Copolymers composed of a polymer segment forming a crystalline phase and a polymer segment forming an amorphous phase, such as the polyester elastomers described above, are preferably used as the polymer c . Specific examples of the polymers b and c are polymers well known to those skilled in the art. When a polymer exemplified as the polymer b is to be used as the polymer c , the two polymers b and c should of course differ from each other, for example in the case of a combination of isotactic polypropylene and polyoxymethylene. Even when both of the polymers have crystallinity capable of forming a row structure as in this example, the elastic fibers of the invention in which at least one of the polymers is the polymer b can be obtained by selecting suitable crystallization conditions. because having regard to the molding conditions, the polymers differ from each other substantially in the crystallizing conditions such as the temperature, the time or the heating medium .For example, when as spun fibers composed of 50 parts by weight of isotactic polypropylene and 50 parts by weight of polyoxymethylene are heat treated at a temperature of about 1500C for about 1 minute in accordance with the process to be described hereinbelow, the former becomes the polymer d and the latter, the polymer c A combination of polymers b and c whose difference in melting point is between about 0 to about 100 C, preferably between 0 to 80 C, is preferred because it shows a crystal arrangement suitable for production of the elastic fibers of the invention and therefore gives the elastic fibers of the invention easily by heat treatment. According to this invention, it is especially preferred to use isotactic polypropylene as the polymer b and a polyester elastomer in which the hard segment is derived from polytetramethylene glycol and tetramethylene glycol as the glycol component and terephthalic acid or both terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid as the acid component as the polymer c or polyoxymethylene as the polymer b and a polyester elastomerIn which the hard segment is derived from polytetramethylene gLycol and tetramethylene glycol as the glycol component and terephthalic acid Qr both terephthalic acid and iso phthalic acid as the acid component as the polymer c or polytetramethylene terephthalate as the polymer b and a polyester elastomer in which the hard segment is derived from polytetramethylene glycol and tetramethylene glycol as the glycol component and terephthalic acid or both terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid as the acid component as the polymer c According to the process of this inventionr at least two thermoplastic polymer including the polymers b and c can give the elastic fibers of the present invention either as a blended mixture or as conjugate fibers. According to the process of this invention.the as spun fibers obtained from at least two thermoplastic polymers including the polymers b and c by the above spinning method are then heat treated to give the elas tic fibers of the invention. The heat treatment is effected by various methods, for example hot air circulation radiation heating by an infrared heater or a sheath heater contacting with ahot drum and heating by such media as hot water, vapor or silicone oils. These methods may be used singly or in combination. The suitable heat treating method can be selected depending upon the type of the polymer b of the as spun fibers The optimal method can be easily determined experimentally. For examples, dry heat treatment is generally desirable. But when poly epsiloncapramide is used as the polymer b , wet heat treatment is desirable. The heat treatment temperature is desirably within the below specified range depending upon the melting point of the polymer b constituting the as spun fibers. Melting point K x 0.8 to 0.98 of the polymer b preferably, Melting point K x 0.9 to 0.97 of the polymer b When the temperature exceeds 0.98 times the melting point absolute temperature of the polymer b , blocking tends to occur as a result of the heat treatment.On the other hand, if the temperature is below 0.8 times the melting point absolute temperature of the polymer b , the heat treated fibers do not have the desired elastic properties, or the heat treating time required for giving the desired elastic properties tends to be prolonged. For example, as spun fibers composed of isotactic polypropylene and a polyester elastomer are heat treated at a temperature determined depending upon the melting point 1680C 4410K of the isotactic polypropylene, which is therefore about 80 to about 1590C, preferably about 124 to about 155 C. The heat treating time depends upon the heattreating temperature but in some cases, a period of not more than 1 second is even sufficient. Since as spun fibers obtained by the spinning method utilizing a spinneret to be heated by Joule heat have such a crystalline structure as can easily give elastic fibers having a row structure by heat treatment, the heat treatment for a relatively short period of time gives the elastic fibers of the invention. Generally, the heat treating time is from several seconds to 60 minutes. The asspun fibers during the heat treatment may be under tension or without tension. Preferably, they are under some tension because elastic fibers having higher elastic recovery can be obtained within the same treating time. The heat treated fibers may be subjected to cold drawing to give elastic fibers having increased elastic properties and latent heat crimpability. The cold drawing treatment can be carried out at a draw ratio of up to about 2,. preferably about 1.01 to about 1.5. A series of steps for producing an elastic fibrous assembly by the process of this invention will now be described specifically with reference to Figure 2 which schematically shows the apparatus for performing the process of the invention. It should be understood that for simplicity, those devices and component parts which do not greatly affect the manufacturing process are omitted in. Figure 2. Figure 2 shows an embodiment in which an elastic fibrous assembly is formed from a spinneret in a direction reverse to the direction of gravity. Needless to say, the process of this invention is not limited to this specific embodiment. In Figure 2, hoppers la and lb for Storing thermoplastic polymers are shown The polymers b and e may be blended in chip form and stored in one of these hoppers from where the polymer blend may be fed into a die 6 having a spinneret 7 through a feeder 2a or 2b, a melt extruder 3a or 3b and a conduit 5a or 5b. Alternatively,. the polymer b may be stocked in one hopper, for example la, and the polymer c in the other, for example lb, and fed into the die in the same way as above. The production of the fibers of the invention is described further with reference to Figure 2 with regard to the case of blending the polymers b and c in chip form and stocking the blend only in the hopper la. Referring to Figure 2, thermoplastic polymers are stocked in the hopper la from where they are supplied to the extruder 3a by means of the feeder 2a.The blended polymers melted by the extruder are fed to the extrusion die 6 in a fixed quantity by a gear pump 4a through a conduit 5a. The die 6 generally includes a heater not shown for maintaining the polymers in the molten state and heating it to the desired temperature. A spinneret 7 is provided on the top part of the die 6. The polymers extruding surface of the spinneret 7 are turned in a direction reverse to the direction of gravity. An electric current can be supplied to the mesh construction of the extrusion surface of the spinneret 7 through copper plates 8. Specifically, this can be achieved by connecting the current taken from a power supply to both ends of the mesh spinneret while adjusting the voltage and current by means of a transformer 9 and a slidac 10. The moltem polymers extruded from the mesh spinneret and converted into fine streams are cooled by a cooling fluid such as air supplied to the extrusion surface of the spinneret or to its vicinity through a feed device 11, and solidified. The solidified fibrous assembly 13 is taken up by a take up roller 12. The feed device 11 serves to supply the cooling fluid uniformly at a certain speed toward the extrusion surface of the mesh spinneret 7 and to its vicinity so that the molten polymers converted into fine streams may be rapidly solidified. Suitably, the feed device 11 has a nozzle or slit. Preferably, the speed and direction of the cooling fluid are determined so that the solidification length pus becomes not more than 2 cm.The solidification length P s means the distance ranging from the extrusion surface of the molten polymers to a point at which they are solidified as fibers. The resulting fibrous assembly 13 is taken up upwardly by the take up roller 12, and sent to a heat treatment step. Figure 2 shows a heat treatment device 14 having a heater. This is a mere example, and may be partly modified. Or another type of heat treatment means may be used. Other take up rollers 15 preferably cooled with water or the like shown in Figure 2 are operated such that the speed of take up of the fibrous assembly by the take up rollers 15 is almost the same as that of the fibrous assembly which passes through the take up roller 12. The fibrous assembly may also be cold drawn by passing it through a cooling zone provided between the take up rollers 15 and the draw rollers 16, and this is generally preferred According to the process of this invention, therefore, the fibrous assembly in the form of an elongated strip can be formed upwardly, as shown in Figure 2. It can be directly sent to subsequent steps, such as a heattreatment step, a crimping step, a cutting step formation of short fibers , a fiber opening step or a webforming step. It will be readily understood from Figure 2 that large quantities or fibrous assemblies can be produced by an apparatus which is on the whole very compact and simple The fine streams of molten polymers from the4 spinneret can be taken up in accordance with the process of this invention so that the packing fraction PF defined by the following equation becomes P6 4 to 1O11 which is much higher than that on the order of 10 at most in a conventional melt spinning process. wherein Da is an apparent draft ratio. The packing fraction CPF represents the sum, of the cross sectional areas of the entire fibers of the fibers assembly formed per unit area of the fiber forming area of the spinneret, and constitutes a measure of the density of fibers spun from the fiber forming area, that is, the high density spinning property. The apparent draft ratio Da is defined by the following equation. Da VL VO wherein VL is the actual take up speed of the fiber assembly cm min. , and VO is the average linear speed cm min. of the polymer melt in the extruding direction when the polymer melt is extruded so as to cover the entire extrusion surface of the fiber forming area of the spinneret. The elastic fibers of the invention composed of at least two thermoplastic polymers are spun preferably by a spinning method using the aforesaid mesh spinneret, and then heat treating the resulting asspun fibers. The elastic fibers of this invention include those composed of a blended mixture of the polymer b and the polymer c and those in the form of conjugate fibers. Which of these two forms is to be produced is determined by the dispersed state of the polymers b and c in the polymer melt fed into the mesh spinnert.For example, according to the method which comprises blending the polymers b and c in chip form and extruding the mixture through an extruder as shown in Figure 2, the polymers b and c are relatively well mixed in the polymer melt fed into the mesh spinneret, and there are formed elastic fibers in which at least one polymer is finely dispersed in the fiber cross section as can be clearly observed from the photo of Figure 7. Figure 7 is a photograph of a cross section of a conjugate fiber composed of a phase of a blended polymer mixture obtained by the polymer chip blending method and a phase of a single polymer. It is clearly seen from this photograph that the mixed state of the two polymers in the blended mixture differs greatly from the mixed state of the conjugate fibers. Alternatively, similar elastic fibers can be produced by stocking the polymers b and c separately in the hoppers la and lb shown in Figure 2 and mixing the two polymers in a screw extruder provided at a position immediately before the die 6 after passage through the conduits 5a and Sb.. Furthermore, composite elastic fibers of the invention the polymers b and c respectively form relatively large polymer phases in the cross section of the fibers as clearly observed from the photo of Figure 6 can be provided by preparing a polymer melt in which the polymers b and c form a relatively large block when they have reached the mesh spinnert as clearly seen from the photo of Figure 53 by a method involvingusing the static mixer previously proposed by the present inventors in European Patent Appln No. 81303502.9 . Various static mixing units used normally in the mixing of molten polymers can be used either singly or in suitable combinations as the mixer for use in the present invention. Other examples of the mixer that cgn be used in this invention include a porous mixer obtained by closely aligning and laminating many porous corrugated plates in the longitudinal direction at certain intervals, a porous mixer made by closely aligning and laminating many wire meshes of a plain weave and or twill weave in the longitudinal direction, and a thin porous mixer made by closely filling and aligning many minute metallic balls and sintering them and thus bonding them to each other. Commercially available state mixers include, for example, a static mixer of Kenics Corp., a Sulzer static mixing unit of GebrAder Sulzer AG, Ross ISG mixer of Charles Ross Co., a square mixer of Sakura Seisakusho, a Komax mixer ofKomax System, Co., and a Bayer continuous mixer of BayerAG. Another static mixer which may be used in this invention is characterized by the fact that a it is a laminate made of a plurality of plates having a depressed portion, b the depressed portion of each of said plates forms a polymer melt inlet and a polymer melt outlet communicating with the polymer melt inlet, c said plates are comprised of at least two types of plates having differently shaped depressed portions, d the polymer melt inlets of plates having depressed portions of the same shape form a common inlet for the same polymer melt, and thus the laminate has at least two common inlets for at least two different polymer melts, and e the polymer melt outlets are formed so as to give at least two different polymer melt flows adjoining each other. In the present specification, the mixer having the above constituent elements a to e is referred to as a laminated plate type static mixer . As far as the present inventors know, such a laminate plate type static mixer is a new type of mixer not known heretofore.By using this type of mixer, there can be easily obtained a molten macroblend in which a number of molten phases of at least two dissimilar polymers are coalesced in a lamellar structure, i.e. in a thin laminar flow.According to the laminated plate type static mixer, a very thin layer like melt can be obtained. The depth t2 of the depressed portion smaller than the thickness tl of the plate, and is preferably satisfies the following expression. 0.2to t2 0.8 tl wherein t1 is the thickness mm of the plate, and t2 is the depth mm of the depressed portion. The especially preferred depth. of the depression satisfies the following expression. 0.3t1 t2 0.7t1 wherein t1 and t2 are as defined hereinabove. It is not necessary that all of the plates have the same thickness. Generally, however, plates of the same type desirably have the same thickness in order to obtain a homogeneous molten macroblend. It is especially advantageous to laminate at least two types of plates having the same thickness and the same depth in building the static mixer. The thickness tl of the plate is generally in. the range of 0.05 to 2 mm, preferably 0.1 to 1 mm, especially preferably 0.2 to 0.7 mm. The plate having a depressed portion has a width W of generally 5 mm to 10 cm, preferably 1 cm to 50 em, and a height H of 5 mm to 50 cm, preferably 1 cm to 30 cm. The static mixer may be provided within the die 6 and or within the conduit 5a or 5b on theway from the conduit 5a or Sb to the die 6. Figure 4 is a schematic vertical sectional view of one example of the die used in the process of this invention. It should be understood. that Figure 4 shows the cross section of the die 6 shown in Figure 2 which is taken by cutting the mesh spinneret held by copper plates at both ends, nearly at its center at right angles vertically when viewed from above0 In Figure 4, the reference numeral 11 represents the die itself 11, and 12, a flow passage of the molten polymers fed through the extruder 3, a gear pump 4 and the conduit 5 of Figure 2. The die 11 includes electric heaters 13 a and 13 b for maintaining the molten polymers at the desired temperature.The molten polymers which have been sent through the flow passage 12 are introduced into a reservoir 14 having aKenics type static mixer 17, and then rises upwardly slowly and stably while being mixed by the mixer 17. Above the die 11 is installed a spinneret which is a mesh spinneret 15 in Figure 4. An area within which the molten polymer is extruded through small openings of the mesh spinneret and formed into a fibrous assembly has a width x. The mesh spinneret is firmly secured to the die 11 by means of fastening devices 16 a and 16 b. At those parts of the mesh spinneret which are held by the fastening devices, the openings of the mesh are blocked up with an inorganic adhesive, a high melting or thermosetting resin, etc.to prevent flowing of electric current. In Figure 4, the direction o arrow means the direction r everseXto the direction of gravity, and y O represents the position of the polymer extruding surface. Cords are connected to copper plates attached to both ends not shown of the mesh spinneret 15 so as for permit. flowing of an electric current. In order to produce the conjugate elastic fibers of the invention using the aforesaid static mixer and mesh spinneret, a combined polymer melt i.e. molten macroblend having many effective continuous boundary lines between the molten phases of the two dissimilar thermoplastic polymers is spun by using a spinneret in which one fourth of the length of a partitioning member which defines one small opening in the spinneret is shorter than each of the aforesaid boundary lines. The fiber cross section of the conjugated elastic fibers of the invention so produced has an average number of blocks S B of preferably 1.5 to 20, especially preferably 2 to 5. R B means the average of the number of independent blocks of thermoplastic polymer which is determined by observing the cross sections of 30 arbitrarily selected fibers at an arbitrary position. The conjugate elastic fibers of the invention may be said to have properties not seen in the elastic fibers of the invention composed of a blended mixture of relatively finely dispersed two or more thermoplastic polymers because they can develop elasticity by the effect of the crystalline structure and also by the conjugate structure. The elasticity based on the conjugate structure can be imparted when the elastic fibers of the invention are being heat treated,. or by subjecting the heat treated fibers to another treatment. The elasticity based on the conjugate structure of the fibers can be also suitably imparted in the form of crimped fibers.Specifically the crimped fibers can be produced by heattreating the conjugate elastic fibers under tension or under no tension in dry heat, boiling water, etc., or by simply drawing the conjugate fibers. The crimped fibers preferably have 3 to 20 crimps, especially 5 to 15 cripms, per inch. ELASTIC FIBERS The process of the invention provide elastic fibers having improved elastic properties, characterized by the fact that a said elastic fibers are composed of at least two thermoplastic polymers, b at least one of said thermoplastic polymers has crystallinity capable of forming a row structure, c at least one other of said thermoplastic polymers has crystallinity capable of forming lamellar crystals, and d said elastic fibers have a row structure. The elastic fibers of the invention are novel in that they are composed of at least two thermoplastic polymers, and have a row structure in which lamellar crystals are stacked. It has been found in accordance with this invention that these elastic fibers can be produced by using at least one thermoplastic polymer having crystallinity capable of forming a row structure and at least one thermoplastic polymer having crystallinity capable of forming lamellar crystals. The elastic fibers of this invention may contain the polymers b and c in any ratios. Prefera bly, these fibers contain the polymer b in an amount of at least about 1096 based on the entire polymers.. The elastic fibers of this invention have improved elastic properties over elastic fibers having a row structure and composed only of the polymer b , fibers composed only of the polymer c Cthe polymer c includes a polymer which gives elastic fibers with the formation of a row structure, a polymer which gives elastic fibers even without forming a row structure, and a polymer which does not form a row structure nor give elastic fibers . Generally, the elastic fibers, when containing a relatively large proportion of the polymer b , tend to show higher elongation and lower initial modulus of elasticity than the elastic fibers composed only of the polymer b while showing much the same elastic recovery as the latter. Furthermore, the elastic fibers of the invention generally tend to show higher elastic recovery, elongation and initial modulus of elasticity than the fibers composed only of the polymer c when they contain a relatively large proportion of the polymer Cc . It will be clearly understood from specific working examples of the invention given hereinbelow that the elastic properties actually shown by the elastic fibers of the invention differ depending upon the types of the polymers b and c , the state of mixing of the polymers b and c , etc. In order that the elastic fibers of the invention show improved elastic properties, especially those suitable for apparel applications, over the elastic fibers composed only of the polymer b , those composed of a blended mixture of the polymers b and c contain the polymer b in a proportion of preferably at least .3046 by weight, more preferably 45 to 95 by weight, based on the entire polymers, and those of conjugate type contain the polymer b in a proportion of at least about 10, by weight, more preferably about 25 to about 90, by weight, above all 30 to 50 by.weight, based on the entire polymers. When the same polymers b and c are used, the blended mixture type elastic fibers of the invention show a greater tendency to increased elongation and reduced initial modulus of elasticity than the conjugate type elastic fibers of the invention at a relatively large polymer b proportion if the proportion of the polymer c is increased relative to the polymer b . Furthermore, when the same polymers b and c are used, the proportion of the polymer at which much the same elastic recovery as that of elastic fibers composed only of the polymer b is attained in a much wider range in the conjugate type elastic fibers of the invention than in the blended mixture tyce elastic fibers of the invention. It has been found in accordance with this invention that the characteristic elastic properties of the blended mixture type elastic fibers of the invention and the conjugated type elastic fibers of the invention can be exhibited by preparing at least one polymer phase of the conJugate type fibers from a blended mixture consisting of a thermoplastic polymerCb capable of forming a row structure and Cc a thermoplastic polymer capable of forming lamellar crystals. The elastic fibers of the invention have an elastic recovery ratio ER after 50 stretch, as defined hereinbelow, of preferably at least 70 , more preferably at least 8046, an inital modulus of elasticity of preferably about 0.5 to about 15 g de, more preferably about 1 to about 10 g de, above all about 1.5 to about 5 g de, an elongation of preferably about 200 to about 700 , more preferably about 300 to about 600 . The elastic fibers of the invention further have a degree of orientation in the direction of the fiber axis of preferably at least about 70 , more preferably at least about 7596. In the row structure, the C axis of the crystals extends substantially in the direction of the fiber axis, and the crystals of the row structure have a long period of preferably about 80 to about 400 9 more preferably about 100 to about 400 i. By performing spinning on the mesh spinneret described hereinabove, the elastic fibers of this invention can be obtained as an assembly of many fibers.In addition to the aforesaid properties, these elastic fibers and assembly have the following properties, When the fibrous assembly of the invention is cut at any position at right angles to the fiber axis, at least 90 , preferably at least 80 , especially preferably at least 70to, of the constituent fibers in this cross section have a non circular cross sectional shape. Most of the fibers constituting the assembly of the invention have a non circular cross sectional shape. According to this invention, the degree of cross sectional non circularity can be quantitatively expressed by the irregular shape factor D d which is the ratio of the maximum distance D between two parallel lines circumscribing a fiber cross section to the minimum distance d between the two circumscribed parallel lines. Each of the fibers having a non circular cross section constituting the assembly of the invention preferably have an irregular shape factor of at least 1.1. Furthermore, when the fibrous assembly of this invention is cut at an arbitrary position at right angles to the fiber axis, the cross sections of at least 50 , preferably at least 45 , especially preferably at least 40 , of the fibers differ from each other in at least one of shape and size. According to this invention,. the cross sections having a non uniform shape and or size can be distinguish ed by microscopic observations. According to thi8 invention, each of the fibers which constitute the fibrous assembly of the invention preferably has an irregular periodic variation in the size of cross sectional area along its longitudinal length. The variation in the size of cross sectional area can be expressed by the intrafiber cross sectional area variation coefficient CV F given by the following formula. CV F Any 3 cm length is selected in a given fiber of the fiber assembly, and the sizes of its crosssectional areas taken at 1 mm intervals are measured by using a microscopee Then, the average I of the sizes of the thirty cross sectional areas, and the standard deviation A of the thirty cross sectional areas are calculated. Based on these values, FV F can be computed in accordance with the above equation. Each of the fibers which constitute the fibrous assembly of this invention preferably has an intrafiber cross sectional area variation coefficient CT F in the range of 6,05 to 1.0. According to the invention, the cross sections having different sizes can be determined quantitatively by the intra assembly fiber cross sectional area variation coefficient CV A given by the following equation CV A A s A wherein S A is the average of the cross sectional sizes of 100 fibers which are obtained by sampling at random a partial assembly of 100 fibers from the fibrous assembly of the invention, and microscopically meassuring the cross sectional sizes of the individual fibers in a cross section taken at an arbitrary position of the partial assembly, and A is the standard deviation of the cross sectional areas of the 100 fibers. Fibers having different cross sectional sizes which constitute the fibrous assembly of the invention have a CV A of preferably O.05 to 1 1.5, more preferably 0.1 to 1.5, especially preferably 0.2 to 1. Wher. a partial assembly of 100 fibers is sampled at random from the fibrous assembly of the invention and the cross sections of th e individual fibers taken at an arbitrary position are observed microscopically, at least 50 of two cross sections sampled at random from the aforesaid cross sections preferably have 1 a shape distribution expressed by an irregular shape factor deviation ratio a of the following ,formulaEMI36.1 wherein D d i represents a larger irregular shape factor, and D d represents a smaller irregular shape factor, or 2 a size distribution expressed by a crosssectional deviation ratio of the following formula EMI37.1 wherein Si is a larger cross sectional size mm2 , Sj is a smaller cross sectional size mm2 , and ss is the cross sectional area deviation ratio. More preferably, the assembly of fibers in accordance with this invention is such that at least 50 of two cross sections sampled at random from the cross sections of the aforesaid fibers viewed by a microscope have 1 a difference in shape expressed by an. irregular shape factor deviation ratio a of at least 2N, and or 2 a difference in cross sectional area expressed by a cross sectional area deviation ratio ss of at least 5, . It is desirable that when the fibrous assembly of, the composite fibers of the invention is cut at an arbitrary position at right angles to the fiber axis, at least 5096, preferably at least 45 , more preferably at least 40K, of the fibers each have in their cross section at least two side by side coalesced blocks of at least two dissimilar thermoplastic polymer phases with at least a part thereof being exposed to the peripheral surface of the fiber, and at least one of the number, shape and size.of the blocks vary from fiber to fiber.It should be understood that the side by side coalesced blocks exclude those blocks which are complete ly embraced, within the fiber cross sections and are not exposed to the peripheral surfaces of the fibers. At least 50 of the composite fibers which constitute the fibrous assembly of the invention have a cross section having at least two side by side coalesced blocks in accordance with the above definition. It will be readily appreciated from the description of the process of this invention that the ratio of cross sections having at least two side by side coalesced blocks can be varied depending upon the state of formation of a molten macroblend phase and the size of the small openings in the spinneret. The number of side by side coalesced blocks should be construed to be the number of independent blocks at least a part of which is exposed to the peripheral surface of the fiber. In the assembly of composite fibers in accordance with this invention, at least two blocks in each fiber may respectively be composed of a single polymer phase, or of a microblend phase in which in a matrix of one polymer at least one other polymer is dispersed. Thus, according to this invention, there is provided an assembly of fibers in which each block consists of a single polymer phase. There is also provided an assembly of fibers in which at least one block appearing in a fiber cross section by microscopic observation is coalesced with another block with a clear boundary line therebetween, said at least one block being composed of a matrix of at least one single polymer in which at least one other polymer is dispersed. The fibrous assembly of fibers provided by this invention have an average. fiber denier dye , as defined below, of 0.1 to 400 denier, preferably 0.3 to 200 denier, more preferably 0.5 to 100 denier. The average denier size De in the assembly can be determined as follows Ten partial assemblies each consisting of 100 fibers are sampled at random from the fibrous assembly for simplicity, three such partial assemblies may be used the results are much the same for both cases , and each partial assembly is cut at one arbitrary position in the axial direction of fiber in a direction at right angles to the fiber axis. The cross section is then photographed through a microscope on a scale of about 2,000 times. The individual fiber cross sections are cut off from the resulting photograph, and their weights are measured. The total weight is divided by the total number of the cross sectional microphotographs, and the result m A is calculated for denier de . Accordingly, the average denier size be in the assembly is calculated in accordance with the following equation. De K.m A wherein m A is the weight average value of the photographic. fiber cross sections cut off and K is a denier calculating factor defined by the equation 9 x 10 .P K r . in which r is the weight g of the unit area of the photograph, is the ratio of area enlargement of the photograph, and P is the specific gravity of the thermoplastic polymers, all of these values being expressed in cÃ§gese. unit.. The elastic fibers of the invention may include heat stabilizers, nucleating agents, fire retarding agents., light stabilizers, slip agents, delusterants, pigments, plasticizers thickeners, etc. which are usually employed as fiber additives. The various properties described in the present application are measured by the following methods. 1 Long periods of crystals based on the row structure Using a small angle X ray scattering device Rotor Unit RU 3H, a product of Rigaku Denki KabushikiKaisha , a chart in the meridional direction is drawn within the range of 20 about 20 15 .
