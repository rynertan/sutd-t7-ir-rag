# AN INITIALIZING APPARATUS FOR USE WITH AN INCREMENTAL PLOTTER

## Abstract
An initializing apparatus for use with an incremental plotter is disclosed. When a new line is drawn on a plotter, it is often desired that a starting point of said new line register and coincide with an end point of a previously drawn line. Sometimes, the starting point and the end point do not coincide. As a result, the present invention is directed to an initializing apparatus used in conjunction with the incremental plotter for performing an initializing operation on each pen selected by said plotter in order to ensure that the end point and starting points coincide. The initializing apparatus comprises an X axis photosensor, including first and second sensors, oppositely disposed with respect to a first light source, and a Y axis photosensor, including first and second sensors, orthogonally disposed with respect to said X axis photosensor and oppositely disposed with re spect to a second light source. The operation of the initial izing apparatus comprises the following steps. Each pen selected by said plotter is placed in said apparatus. The selected pen moves in the X and Z directions until the output signal from each of the first and second sensors associated with said X axis photosensor drop to 50 of its maximum value, the maximum value being obtained when the entire surface area of each said sensor is exposed by light from said light source. The selected pen moves in the Y direction until the output signal from the first sensor associated with said Y axis photosensor is equal to the output signal from the second sensor associated with the Y axis photosensor.
