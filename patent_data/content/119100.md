# PROCESS FOR PREPARING A SPINNABLE PITCH PRODUCT

## Abstract
A spinnable pitch product is obtained from a carbo naceous reside which is of petroleum origin and of de creased content of distillation removable oils, more especial ly polycondensed aromatic oils. The de oiled, preferably molten, residue is treated to a first extraction stage with at least one organic solvent of solubility parameter 8.0 to 9.5. The solubilized phase therefrom is subjected to a second extraction stage with the same or another said solvent. A precipitated fraction is thus obtained, and this is then heated at 250 to 400 C. The resultant pitch product is suitable for spinning to carbon fibers or for use in the manufacture of other carbon artifacts.
