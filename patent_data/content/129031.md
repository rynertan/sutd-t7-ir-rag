# ANTIMUTAGENIC AGENT

## Abstract
Coenzyme A, pyridoxal 5 phosphoric acid, as well as pantothenic acid and alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts thereof are active as antimutagenic agents. Mutagenicity if believed to be responsible for most causes of human cancer, and there are certain foods that have proved to contain mutagens. However, their mutagenicity can be sufficiently suppressed by ingesting them together with the compounds listed above. These compounds are either vitamins or their endoforms, and hence can be safely incorporated in foods.
