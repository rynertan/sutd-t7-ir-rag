# Process for the preparation of a silver halide emulsion.

## Abstract
Process for the preparation of silver halide emulsions containing populations of monodispersed silver halide crys tals, which comprises transferring an amount of monodis persed silver halide crystals from a reaction vessel to a holding vessel, effecting growth of the silver halide crystals remaining in the reaction vessel, transferring the monodis persed silver halide crystals thus obtained to a further holding vessel followed by another growth step of the silver halide crystals left in the reaction vessel, combining all the populations of monodispersed silver halide crystals of different crystal size, and carrying out the steps required to produce a fully sensitized and concentrated silver halide emulsion. These emulsions when used in photographic materials exhibit a reduced contrast and a relatively high sensitivity.
