# Multiprocessor system having mutual exclusion control function.

## Abstract
A multiprocessor system includes a plurality of processors 10 1 to 10 N which are respectively connected to a memory device 3 and each of which produces a first control signal when executing a test and set instruction and a second control signal after executing a sequence of queuing steps. The multiprocessor system further has flip flop circuits 12 1 to 12 N each of which is set in response to the first control signal from the corresponding one of the processors 10 1 to 10 N and which are commonly reset in response to a second control signal from any one of the processors 10 1 to 10 N . The processors 10 1 to 10 N are prevented from executing the test and set instruction while the corresponding one of the flip flop circuits 12 1 to 12 N is set.
