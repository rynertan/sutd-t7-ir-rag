## Abstract
Apparatus for the pelletization of heat liquifiable mate rials, such as metallurgical slags, consists of feed means for the molten material, these feed means depositing the material on a downwardly extending feed plate over which it flows while it is mixed with water, if water is necessary to promote the expansion of the molten material and for control of the cooling. The material then flows on to a first rotating radially vaned drum or rotor by which it is projected into the air for simultaneous cooling and pelletization. The feed means comprises flow control means such that any flow greater than a predetermined maximum is fed onto a second feed plate disposed above the first, from which the excess molten material flows on to a second rotating radially vaned drum or rotor operative in like manner to the first. The flow control means may comprise for example a dam over which the excess material flows. Preferably both of the feed plates are mounted to vibrate and are vibrated by a rotating eccentric weight to reduce adhering of the material to the feed surface plate by thus reducing the heating thereof.
