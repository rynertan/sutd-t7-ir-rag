# Apparatus for treating neurovegatative disorders.

## Abstract
Disclosed is apparatus for treating a subject suffering from a neurovegetative disorder, which comprises means for applying to the brain of said subject, a therapeutically ef fective amount of an electrically induced energy capable of influencing the vegetative nervous system of the brain, the application of said energy being performed by placing a suitably adapted energy applicator 138 in the mouth or endonasal cavity of the subject. The applicator is energised so that the brain and in particular the limbic system thereof receives electrically induced energy from the applicator. The electrically induced energy consists of an electroma gnetic wave or field energy.
