# Block copolyester plastifiers and halogen containing polymer compositions containing them.

## Abstract
Block copolyesters and block copolyesterurethanes con taining, in ordered or random distribution, about 15 to 50 percent of amorphous blocks and about 85 to 50 percent of crystalline or semi crystalline blocks are highly compatible and substantially non fugitive when blended with halogen containing polymers, for instance PVC.
