# Method of manufacturing printing heads for ink jet printers and a printing head manufactured by the method.

## Abstract
A bundle of parallel glass tubes 27 is passed through openings 29 in parallel alignment plates 5 which divide the bundle into a central portion 31 in a zone between the two alignment plates and two end portions 33 beyond this zone. Subsequently, the tubes are softened by heating and the central portion of the bundle is constricted. Subsequently, the central portion is embedded in a moulding compound which, when set, forms two coupling pieces 1 for printing heads, which coupling pieces can be separated from one another along a separating plane 37 which extends parallel to the alignment plates. Thus, important parts of at least two printing heads are manufactured simultaneously.
