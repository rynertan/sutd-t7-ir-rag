# Flexible ties.

## Abstract
A bandolier 30 of flexible plastics ties 10 for supply to an automatic tie gun to effect tying of a roll or bundle, the ties being held in parallel arrangement in the bandolier by integral bridging pieces 32 with buckles or apertured heads 12 along one edge of the bandolier and the ends of the tails 14 of the ties along the other edge. The buckles 12 may be aper tured parallel or transversely to the length of the tie, to suit the type of gun being fed. A preferred embodiment of bandolier is incorporated in a magazine having a mouth shaped to bend the tie as it enters the gun so that the apertured buckle is correctly orientated.
