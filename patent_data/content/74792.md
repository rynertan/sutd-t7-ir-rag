# Isomer enrichment process for cyclopropane carboxylates.

## Abstract
A method of partially resolving the cis and trans isomers of a cyclopropane carboxylate by a controlled partial hyd rolysis. The cis trans distribution in the hydrolyzed product differs from that in the starting material. The cyclopropane carboxylates are known intermediates for the natural and synthetic pyrethroids, some of which exhibit a difference in pesticidal activity depending on whether the cis or trans isomers are applied.

## Description
ISOMER ENRICHMENT PROCESS FOR CYCLOPROPANECARBOXYLATES Natural and synthethic cyclopropane derivatives have been of considerable interest in the pesticide field. In particular, various esters or analogues of chrysanthemic or pyrethric acids have achieved commercial acceptance as insecticides on a wide scale. Specific examples of such compounds are those of the following Formula I EMI1.1 wherein X may be hydrogen to define the structure of permethrin and cyano to define cypermethrin as described in U.S. Patent 4,024,163. Insecticidal compounds of the Formula I may be prepared by esterification of a compound of the followingFormula 11 with a compound of the following Formula III EMI1.2 wherein Q and COQ1 are functional groups or atoms which will react together to form an ester linkage and X is as described for Formula I .It is usually convenient to react the acid or acid halide with the alcohol, e.g. COQ1 is COOH or COHalide and Q is OH or to react a halogeno compound, i.e., Q is halogen and X H, with a salt of the carboxylic acid, i.e., COQ1 isCOO M where M is, for example, a silver or triethylammonium cation as set forth in U.S. Patent 4,024,163.Further, the acid chloride of Formula II , i.e., wherein COQ1 is COHalide may be reacted with the aldehyde derivative of Formula III , i.e., wherein Q is 0 and X is H, in the presence of a cyanide to yield the pesticide of Formula I wherein X is cyano. Such reactions are described in U.S.Patents 4,024,163, 4,254,050, 4,254,051, 4,254,052 and 4,280,965. Carboxylic acid or acid chloride compounds ofFormula II may be obtained from the corresponding intermediate ester, e.g., COQ1 is COOCH3, by hydrolysis with strong base or hydrolysis followed by halogenation, respectively. In turn, the intermediate esters may be prepared as described in Recent Advances in Synthethic Pyrethroids byAlfred Bader in Aldrichimica Acta 9, No. 3, pages 49 51 1976 . It is known that various pyrethroid type cyclopropane derivatives exhibit a difference in biological activity depending on whether the cis or trans isomer is used as set forth in U.S. Patent 4,024,163. Interconversions between cis and trans in this series are known but involve considerable chemical effort and expense, see Elliot and James in Pyrethrum, the Natural Insecticide by John E. Casida,Academic Press at page 76 1973 . An object of the present invention is a process which adjusts the cis trans ratio of a vicinal substituted cyclopropane carboxylate compound or changes the ratio of a product of a reaction of a vicinal substituted cyclopropane carboxylate compared to the starting material. The vicinalsubstituted cyclopropane carboxylates or said reaction products are known intermediates in the synthesis of pyrethroid pesticides. The present invention provides a method of adjusting the cis trans ratio of a vicinally disubstituted cyclopropane, a carboxylate being one of the substituents, by the use of a controlled hydrolysis reaction of the carboxylate functionality whereby less than 100 of the starting material is converted to the corresponding acid or salt. It has been found that the cis and trans isomers do not hydrolyse at the same rate and this factor may be used to recover the carboxylate and or the product acid in a different cis trans ratio than was present in the starting material. The starting material for the process of the invention is a cis trans isomeric mixture of a vicinal substituted cyclopropane carboxylic acid ester or a mixture of different vicinal substituted cyclopropane carboxylates. Of particular interest are compounds of the following Formula IV EMI3.1 R1 1 3 wherein R1 represents hydrogen R2 and R3, which may be the same or different, represent halogen, e.g., fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, or a halogenated alkyl group, e.g., a lower alkyl group of about 1 to 6 carbons having at least one halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, an example being trifluoromethyl and R may be an alkyl group such as a lower alkyl group of about 1 to 6 carbons, e.g., a methyl or ethyl group, or an aryl group such as a phenyl group or a benzyl or substituted benzyl group.Particular examples of compounds of Formula IV are the 2,2 dimethyl 3 2,2 dichlorovinyl cyclopropane carboxylates and 2, 2 dimethyl 3 2 chloro 3,3,3 trifluoroprop l en l yl cyclopropane carboxylates and particular carboxylates are the methyl and ethyl esters. As used in the present invention, cis and trans refer to the relationship between two substituents on vicinal, i.e., adjacent, carbons of a cyclopropane ring. An example of this usage is the vinyl and ester moieties directly attached to the cyclopropane ring in Formula IV , see Chapter 7 of Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds by E. L. Eliel, McGraw Hill, New York 1962 . A first embodiment of the present invention involves the steps of i partially hydrolyzing the vicinal substituted cyclopropane carboxylate to form less than 100 mole of the corresponding acid or salt thereof ii separating the vicinal substituted cyclopropane carboxylic acid formed in step i from the unreacted vicinal substituted cyclopropane carboxylate and iii recovering the cis enriched vicinal substituted cyclopropane carboxylate. In a second embodiment of the invention, steps i and ii of the first embodiment are carried out but the third step is the recovery of the trans enriched vicinal substituted carboxylic acid reaction product. If a trans enriched vicinal substituted carboxylic acid ester is desired, the trans enriched carboxylic acid may simply be esterified with an alkanol by conventional means.The trans enriched carboxylate may be used as an intermediate for a pyrethroid final product having a high trans content. A high trans material may be less active as a pesticide than a cis enriched pyrethroid and lower activity may be desirable in view of a lessened effect against non target species. Alternatively, the trans enriched material may be accumulated and reprocessed to raise the cis content, e.g., by equilibration. The first step of either embodiment of the invention involves hydrolysis of less than 100 mole of the vicinal substituted cyclopropane carboxylate, more particularly about 30 to 70 mole . The partial hydrolysis may be accomplished by acidic or basic hydrolysis. In particular, basic hydrolysis may be carried out utilizing a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, e.g., NaOH or KOH, or an alkaline earth metal hydroxide or carbonate in less than 100 mole or by using a base at a lower hydrolysis temperature or for a shorter reaction time. Variation in these parameters, i.e., the particular base, the molar amount of the base, reaction temperature and reaction time, may be used to control the rate and extent of hydrolysis.The hydrolysis may be carried out at a temperature less than about 1000C, e.g., from about 2O0C to 100 C. High temperature may result in degradation of the starting material. One or more solvents may be present during the hydrolysis reaction. Particular solvents for the hydrolysis are water miscible solvents such as lower alcohols, e.g., methanol or ethanol, glycols, e.g. propylene glycol, and lower ketones, e.g., acetone, as well as water itself. Basic hydrolysis has the advantage in the process of the invention of yielding the product of the hydrolysis in the form of a salt which is readily separated from an organic phase composed of the starting material ester. Acidic hydrolysis, i.e., acid catalyzed hydrolysis, may be advantageous if any of the substituents on the cyclopropane ring are base sensitive. Acid catalyzed hydrolysis may be controlled, as the basic hydrolysis, to result in less than 1001 conversion to the carboxylic acid with a difference in the cis trans distribution between the starting ester and the carboxylic acid product. The second step of either embodiment of the invention is the separation of the vicinal substituted cyclopropane carboxylic acid product from the starting material.Conventional techniques such as crystallization, distillation, chromatography or separation by differences in solvent solubility may be used although the prefered method in view of simplicity is separation by solvent solubility. Thus, a water immiscible solvent or solvents can be added to the reaction mixture to produce a two phase system with the acid or salt product being more soluble in the water miscible phase and the carboxylate starting material being more soluble in the water immiscible phase. Particular water immiscible solvents include aromatic solvents such as benzene, toluene or xylene, higher ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone and methyl iso butyl ketone, chlorinated solvents such as methylene chloride and chlorobenzene and esters such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate.The two phase system is shaken to achieve proper separation of the components between the two solvent system.Further, a phase separation aid such as an aqueous solution of sodium chloride or brine, may be added. In the third step of the two embodiments of the invention, the cis enriched carboxylate or trans enriched acid or salt product is recovered, the enrichment being relative to the cis trans distribution of the carboxylate before the hydrolysis reaction. If a two phase solvent system is used for the second step separation, the recovery can be accomplished by drawing off or decanting one of the two phases. In order to describe the invention so that it may be more clearly understood, the following examples are set forth.Abbreviations used include 0C degrees centigrade g grams ml milliliters mm Hg millimeters of mercury pressure C, H, N, O, Na, etc. the universally accepted symbols for the chemical elements PAM methyl 3 2,2 dichlorovinyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropane carboxylate also known as permethrin acid methyl ester and PAE ethyl 3 2,2 dichloro inyl 2,2 dimetbylcyclopropane carboxylate also known as permethrin acid ethyl ester . All cis or trans contents are reported on a normalized basis, i.e., the amount of cis and trans isomer of the chemical entity being considered is considered to be 100 . The actual analysis may be different on a weight or molar basis since some inert or side reaction product may be present.Unless otherwise noted, all cis trans percentage distributions are on a weight basis and determined by gas liquid chromatography. The brine solution used in theExamples, unless otherwise noted, is an about 10 by weight sodium chloride in water solution obtained by mixing 100 g ofNaCl in 1 liter of water. Example 1 A mixture of 10 g of PAM having a 43 57 cis trans distribution, 15 ml of methanol and a solution of 0.9 g of NaOH in 10 ml of water was heated with stirring at 64 670C for 2 hours. In preparing this and other mixtures in the Examples, care should be taken to avoid contacting the cyclopropane carboxylate ester, such as PAM, directly with concentrated base. Thus, in this Example, the aqueous caustic was first diluted with the methanol after which the PAM was added. TheNaOH represented about one half of the calculated amount necessary to fully hydrolyze the PAM. After cooling to room temperature, 20 ml of toluene and 40 ml of brine, were added and the mixture was shaken. Upon standing, a phase separation quickly occurred.The toluene layer was withdrawn and the solvents evaporated on a rotary vacuum evaporator to yield 6.0 g of unhydrolyzed PAM having a cm trans distribution of about 54 46. Example 2 To a solution of 20 g PAM having a 47.3 52.7 cis trans distribution in 30 ml of methanol was added a solution of 1.8 g of NaOH in 20 ml water. The mixture was stirred and heated to 670C for 2.5 hours. After cooling to room temperature, 40 ml of toluene and 80 ml of a sodium chloride brine solution were added and the mixture was shaken. After being allowed to settle, separation of the phases occurred and the toluene laye was withdrawn and vacuum evaporated at 600C and 45 mm Hg followed by less than 1 mm Hg. Analysis of the 10.3 g of residue showed a 60.2 39.8 cis trans distribution. Example 3 A solution of 21 g PAE having a 42.9 57.1 cis trans distribution in 30 ml of methanol was mixed at 670C for 2.5 hours with a solution of 1.8 g NaOH in 20 ml of water. The organic layer was isolated as in Examples 1 and 2 using 40 ml of toluene and 80 ml of a brine solution. The 11.9 g of cis enriched ester was found to be a mixture of PAM and PAE having a 53.4 cis content by weight. The molar ratio in the product of PAM PAE was 0.7 1. Example 4 The procedure and material amounts of Example 3 were repeated using 30 ml of ethanol in the place of methanol. The yield of cis enriched PAE was 12.4 g which showed a 51.2 cis content. Example 5 A solution of a 10 g of PAM having a 41.5 58.5 cis trans distribution in 15 ml of methanol was mixed with a solution of 0.75 g NaOH in 10 ml of water and heated at 670C for 1.5 hours. The reaction product was cooled to room temperature and 20 ml of toluene and 40 ml of brine were added. The mixture was shaken and the toluene layer was removed after phase separation. Evaporation of the toluene layer at 650C and 10 20 mm Hg gave a product residue of 6.8 g. Analysis showed a 49.8 50.2 cis trans distribution. Example 6 The procedures of Example 5 were repeated using twice the amounts of each material with the exception of using 1.1 g of NaOH. After work up, analysis of the 14.2 g residue showed a 47.5 52.5 cis trans distribution. Example 7 A solution of 20 g PAM having a 41.5 58.5 cis trans distribution in 30 ml of methanol was mixed with a solution of 5.93 g potassium carbonate in 20 ml water and heated at 65 750C for 2.5 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled and phase separation occured after adding 40 g of toluene and 80 ml of brine and shaking. The toluene phase was drawn off and evaporated at 60 C and 40 mm Hg, followed by 5 7 mm Hg. Analysis of the 15.6 g of residue showed a 45 55 cis trans distribution. Example 8 A sample of 20 g of PAM having a 55.3 44.7 cis trans distribution was treated in the manner described in Example 2 for 1.2 hours and worked up similarly. Analysis of the 10.7 g of residue showed a 70 30 cis trans distribution. Example 9 This example was carried out following the procedures and material amounts described in Example 2 except that the PAM had a 55.3 44.7 cis trans distribution, the reaction time was 1.5 hours and 2.35 g of NaOH were used as opposed to 1.8 g.After the work up described in Example 2, analysis of the 8.3 g of residue showed a 74.6 25.4 cis trans distribution.
