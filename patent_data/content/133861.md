# Impact switch.

## Abstract
A resettable impact switch is disclosed having a hous ing 12 , a first terminal 22 and a second terminal 26 secured to the housing, and a moveable conductor 44 maintained in contact at one end with a reservoir of mercury and at the opposite end with the second terminal 26 . The reservoir of mercury is, in turn, in contact with said first terminal 22 , allowing the conduction of current through the switch when the moveable conductor 44 is connected to said second terminal 26 and said reservoir of mercury, as during normal operation thereof. Upon a predetermined level of impact imparted to said switch or upon inversion thereof, the connection between the conductor 44 and mercury is broken, thereby opening the switch. The switch is maintained open until a resetting operation is performed. The connection between the opposite end of the conductor can also be broken to de activate the switch.
