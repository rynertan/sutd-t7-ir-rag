# Shielded electrical cable.

## Abstract
In an electrical cable comprising a plurality of conductors 1, 2 extending in a spaced parallel relationship in a common plane surrounded by outer layers 5, 7 of insulating material joined by web portions 8 , certain conductors 1 are sur rounded by inner layers 3 of insulating material which are in turn surrounded by individual foil shielding layers 4 , the shielding layers 4 being interconnected and connected to at least one other conductor 2 by a shielding connection member 6 in the form of a foil which extends through the web portions 8 of the cable.
