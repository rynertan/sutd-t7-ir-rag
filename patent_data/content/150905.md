# ANTI IDIOTYPE ASSAY USING FLUORESCENT ENERGY TRANSFER

## Abstract
Homogeneous immunoassay for the detection of an ana lyte based upon competition between the analyte and an anti idiotype antibody for a binding site on an antibody specific for the analyte. Detection is accomplished by measuring the changes in flurescent emission of either the donor or acceptor molecule of a donor acceptor fluorescent energy transfer pair or changes in the donor fluorescent emission time constant.
