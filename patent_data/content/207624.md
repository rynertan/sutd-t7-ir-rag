# Method for preparing infection resistant materials.

## Abstract
An infection resistant polymeric material, such as polytetrafluoroethylene, for use on or within a human or animal body, for example, in the form of a vascular graft, can be prepared by an improved method which comprises the following sequence of steps a soaking a polymeric material with a solution of an antimicrobial agent, such as sodium sulfadiazine, oxacillin dissolved in an organic solvent there for, such as an ethanol chloroform mixture, b soaking the polymeric material with an organic solvent, such as ethanol, for a metal salt and c resoaking the polymeric material with the solution of the antimicrobial agent dissolved in the orga nic solvent therefor. The polymeric material is dried after each soaking step. Preferably, in the intermediate soaking step b the organic solvent contains a metal salt, such as silver nitrate, dissolved therein, so as to form in situ the metal salt of the antimicrobial agent, such as silver sulfadiazine.
