Novel ammonium fluorophthalamates, fluorophthalamic acids, fluorophthalimides, fluorophthaloyl fluoride, and alkali metal salts of fluorophthalinlides can be prepared through the process of the invention being particularly useful as chemical intermediates for the preparation of a wide variety of end products including pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals such as pesticides, and, in particular, as reactants in novel and advantageous.methods for the synthesis of fluoroanthranilic acids, fluoroanilines, fluorobenzoic acids and other fluorinated aromatic compounds. SUI ,IdARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with this invention novel fluorophthalamic compounds are produced through the following novel reaction sequence A Chlorophthalic anhydrides of the formulaEMI1.1 wherein n is 1 or 2, are reacted with potassium fluoride or cesium fluoride to form fluorophthalic anhydrides of the formulaEMI1.2 wherein n is as hereinabove defined B The fluorophthalic anhydride of A is then reacted with animonia to form aililoni um fl uorophtha 1 ama tes C The ammonium fluorophthalamates of B are acidified to form fluorophthalamic acids D The fluorophthalanic acids of C are dehydrated to form fluorophthal imide and E The fluorophthalimides of D are reacted with an alkali metal base to form alkali metal fluorophthalimides. In accordance with this invention the novel sequence of reactions contemplates the production of novel compounds within each step of the sequence. For example, this invention relates to the novel compound 4,5 difluorophthaloyl fluoride and to a method for the preparation thereof. It also relates to novel ammonium fluorophthalaniates, fluoro phthalarnic acids, fluorophthalimides, alkali metal salts or iluorophthal mides and novel methods for their preparation.The specific sequence of the novel process is A reacting a chlorophthalic anhydride of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein n is 1 or 2, with potassium fluoride or cesiun fluoride to form a fluorophthalamic anhydride of the formulaEMI2.2 wherein n ls as previously aeTineo B Reacting the fluorophthalic anhydride of A with ammonium to form an ammonia salt of said fluorophthalamic acid of the formulaEMI3.1 wherein n is as previously defined C Acidifying the ammonia salt of B to form a fluorophthalamicEMI3.2 D Dehydrating the fluorophthalamic acid of C to form aEMI3.3 wherein n ls as previously aerinea E React the fluorophthalimide of D with an alkali metal base to form an alkali metal fluoroohthalimide of the formulaEMI3.4 wherein n is as previously defined and m is an alkali metal ion. A The fluorination step of the process, that is the preparation of fluorophthalic anhydride by reaction of chlorophthalic anhydride with potassium fluoride or cesium fluoride, may be carried out under a wide range of conditions. The temperature of the reaction may vary considerably for example, from about 75 or lower to 300 Celsius or higher, depending, in part on the particular chlorophthalic anhydride reactant used and whether or not a catalyst is employed. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a catalyst, at a temperature in the range of about 800 to about 2800 Celsius. When potassium fluoride is employed as the fluorinating agent, it is preferred to carry out the reaction at higher temperatures, such as about 1800 to about 2750 Celsius.When cesium fluoride is employed as the fluorinating agent, lower temperatures, such as about 800 to about 2000 Celsius are preferred. The preferred catalysts that may be employed in the fluorination step are polyether catalysts, such as crown ethers, polyethylene glycols, or alkoxy polyethylene glycols, such polyethers typically having a molecular weight ranging from about 200 to about 25,000.Typically, the catalysts are employed in amounts of about 0.1 to about 20 percent, and preferably about 5.0 to about 15 percent by weight, based on the amount of chlorophthalic anhydride. The fluorination reaction is preferably and conveniently carried out under atniospheric pressure conditions. However. super atmospheric and sub atmospheric conditions may be employed, if desired. It is preferred, but not essential, to employ a catalyst when potassium fluoride is used as the fluorinating agent When cesium fluoride is used, a catalyst may be employed, but is not preferred, due to the higher reactivity of that fluorinating agent. Although it is preferred to run the fluorination reaction neat, an inert solvent, such as do polar aprotic solvent may be employed if desired. Suitable solvents include, for example, dimethylsulfoxide dimethylformamide N methyl 2 pyrrolidinone sulfolane hexamethylphosphoramide, and the like. The proportion of reactants for the fluorination step may vary widely. Generally it is preferred to employ about 20 to about 25 percent molar excess of potassium fluoride or cesium fluoride fluorinating agent. If anhydrous potassium fluoride is utilized in the fluorination agent with 4,5 dichlorophthalic anhydride as a reactant and the molar ratio of potassium fluoride ichlorophthalic anhydride maintained at from about 4 1 to about 20 1 tne novel compound 4,5 difluorophthaloyl flux can be produced in economic quantities along with thefluorophthalic anhydride of the disclosed reaction sequence. 4,5 difluorophthaloyl fluoride is useful as a chemical intermediate in the preparation of various chemical end products, such as 4,5 difluorophthalimide and resins such as polyamides, and the like.Polyamides having fluorine substituentI on the polymer chain may be prepared by polycondensation of 4,5 difluorophthaloyl fluoride with a suitable diamine, such as piperazine, utilizing such known techniques as interfacial polymerization or solution polymerization. B The ammonolysis of the fluorophthalic anhydride may be carried out over a wide range of temperatures. The preferred reaction temperature is about 500 to about 1 OCO, and most preferably about 700 to about 400 Celsius. Lower temperatures may be employed but are generally unnecessary and uneconomical. At temperatures above about 40 Celsius, depending on the particular fluorophthalamic acid being prepared, the concurrent formation of the fluorophthalimide may occur. To achieve high yields of the ammonium fluorophthalamate it is preferred to employ the ammonia reactant in excess of about two molar equivalents of NH3 per mole of fluorophthalic anhydride. The preferred ammonia reactant is anhydrxus ammonia. Aqueous ammonia may be employed, if desired, but is not preferred since it has been found to encourage the formation of by products, such as fluorophthalic acids. The process is preferably carried out at about atmospheric pre..ure, awl though super atmospheric pressures nizy be alllJloyed, if desired. Generally, subatmospheric pressures are avoided, due to the volatility of the anunonia reactant. It is preferred to carry out the ammonolysis reaction in a suitable solvent, particularly a solvent that will dissolve the fluorophthalic anhydride and that is substantially unreactive with ammonia. Suitable solvents include, for example, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, low molecular weight methoxy ethyleneglycols, such as dimethoxyethane, dimethoxy diethyleneglycol and the like. In accordance with this invention ammonium fluorophthalamates of the formulaEMI6.1 wherein n is 1 or 2 are formed. Typical compounds formed include ammonium 4,5 difluorophthalamate, ammonium 4 fluorophthalamate, ammonia 5 fluorophthalamate, ammonia 3 fl uorophthalamate and ammonium 6fluorophthalamate. The ammonium fluorophthalamates of this invention are particularly useful as novel reactants in a novel and advantageous method for the preparation of fluoroanthranilic acids and fluoroanilines. Fluoroanthran.lic acids and fluoroanilines may be prepared by 1 reacting an ammonium fluorophthalamate of the formula EMI6.2 wherein n is 1 or 2, with an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hypochlorite to form the corresponding fluoroanthranilic acid and 2 decarboxylating the fluoroanthranilic acid by reaction with a mineral acid to form the corresponding fluoroaniline of the formulaEMI7.1 where n is as previously defined. The fluoroanthranilic acid produced in step 1 above may be recovered separately. The fluoroanthranilic acids are useful intermediates in the preparation of various other fluorinated aromatic compounds. For example, the fluoroanthranilic acid may be reacted in an acidic medium such as hydrochloric acid with sodium nitrite to prepare fluorobenzoic acids. C The ammonium fluorophthalamate may be converted to the corresponding fluorophthalamic acid by acidification. Typically, the fluorophthalamate is dissolved in a minimum amount of water and the solution is acidified to a pH of about 1.5 to about 6.0 by addition of an acid such as HC1, H2S04, H3P04, HBr, HI, HF, HN03 or the like.The fluorophthalmic acid may then be recovered by precipitation or by removal of the water, e.g. by low temperature evaporation or distillation. The fluorophthalamic acids formed by the invention are characterized by the formulaEMI7.2 wherein n is 1 or 2 and typically include compounds such as 4,5 difluorophthalamic acid, 4 difluorophthalamic acid, 5 fluorophthalamic acid, 3 fluorophthalamic acid, 6 fluorophthalamic acid and the like. The fluorol,hth,31al lic acids of tDis invention are particularly useful as novel reactants in d novel dnd advantdeous method for the prepdration of fluoroanthranilic acids and fluoroanilines. The fluoroanthranilic acids and fluoroanilines may be prepared by reacting a fluorophthalamic acid of the formula EMI8.1 where n is 1 or 2, with an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hypochlorite to form the corresponding fluoroanthranilic acids, and decarboxylating the fjuoroantt ranilic acid by reaction with a mineral acid to form the correspcnuing fluoroaniline of the formulaEMI8.2 where n is as previously defined. The fluoroanthranilic acids are useful intermediates in the preparation of various other fluorinated aromatic compounds. For example, the fluoroanthranilic acid may be reacted in an acidic medium such as hydrochloric acid with sodium nitrite to prepare fluorobenzoic acids. D .The fluorophthamamic acids may be dehydrated by moderate heating, typically at about 400 to about 3500 Celsius to form the corresponding fluorophthalimides. Alternatively, the fluorophthalimides may be prepared directly from the ammonium salt of fluorophthalamic acids by heating to an elevated temperature, such as about 1500 to about 3500 Celsius. TEle fluorophthalimides dre cildlacterized by the formula EMI9.1 wherein n is 1 or 2 and typically include compounds such as 4,5 difluorophthalimide, 3 fluorophthalimide and the like.
