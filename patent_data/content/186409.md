## Description
HOMOGENEOUS CATALYST RECOVERY The present invention relates to the recovery of spent homogeneous metallic catalyst. Homogeneous catalysis is used in a number of commercially useful processes, e.g. hydroformylation of olefins. These catalysts are commonly salts and or complexes of a Group VIII metal such as cobalt, rhodium, ruthenium and iridium. While it is desirable to recover catalysts in general, it is especially important to recover catalysts which contain exotic and more expensive metals such as rhodium and iridium. It is also advantageous to recover the catalyst in an active form substantially ready for direct reuse or recycle. A process has now been discovered by which homogeneous metallic catalysts may be recovered in an active form suitable for direct re use. In accordance with the present invention, a process for recovering a spent homogeneous catalyst from a reaction mixture comprises 1 contacting the mixture with a resin bearing a non ionic heterocyclic electron donor residue 2 filtering off the resin after step I 3 freeing the homogeneous catalyst complex from the resin obtained in 2 by displacement with a suitable ligand and 4 recovering the homogeneous catalyst from step 3 in its active form. The homogeneous catalyst is a metal containing compound or complex in which the metal is of Group VIII, particularly the platinum group, preferably rhodium and especially rhodium II . Examples of the metal catalyst compounds complexes are the metal C2 10 carboxylates and the metal complexes with ligands such as CO R3Z, RO 3Z, and R02 ZR whereR is a suitable alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or alkaryl group and Z is P, Sb or As, preferably P. Catalysts of special interest are rhodium carboxylates, preferably Rh II carboxylates, particularly Rh ll C 8 carboxylates and especially Rh JI octanoate dimer. The resin used must have in its structure a suitable heterocyclic electron donor residue. The resin of course, is an insoluble organic polymer such as that obtained by polymerization of a suitable monomer or mixture of monomers and subsequent cross linking as appropriate. Among suitable electron donor residues are heterocyclic groups such as a pyridine, imidazole and bis picolamine. Suitable resins include cross linked and linear polymers of 2 vinylpyridine, 4 vinylpyridine and vinylimidazole. An especially useful resin is a cross linked vinyl pyridine resin. The catalyst bound to the resin is separated or displaced from it by tretment with any suitable unattached ligand. Such ligands are illustrated by compounds such as dimethylformamide, CH3CN, pyridine, tetrahydrofuran, methanol and dimethylsulfoxide, preferably CH3CN. Usually, the displacement is achieved by treating the resin bearing the bound catalyst with an organic acid to neutralize the electron donor Lewis base residue, followed by treatment with an unattached ligand alone or in a compatible solvent, such as a mixture of methylene chloride containing formic or acetic acid. The catalyst, in active form, is then recovered after displacement by conventional means such as vacuum distillation or extraction. The recovered catalyst is active and may then be recycled directly into the process in which it was originally spent.

The filtrate was concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The catalyst was deposited on the walls of the flask and dissolved in 250 ml of methylene chloride. While the Example illustrates recovery of the catalyst prior to crystallization of Compound B, the spent catalyst may also be recovered from the reaction mixture after crystallization of Compound B if desired. The example clearly illustrates that the catalyst recovered is active since it is directly recycled into the reactions illustrated by equationA.
