# Anti skid brake control system for automotive vehicle.

## Abstract
An anti skid brake control system performs arithmetic operations for deriving wheel speed on the basis of wheel sensor signal pulses at a first given timing. The first given timing is determined in view of response characteristics of an electromagnetic actuator of a pressure control valve in a hyd raulic brake system. The anti skid control system also per forms arithmetic operations for deriving wheel acceleration on the basis of wheel speed sensor signal pulses at a second timing. The second timing is adjusted according to the sensor signal pulse frequency so that the difference between succes sive pulse intervals or the difference between the durations of successive sensor signal pulsegroups exceeds a given value which is the threshold for performing wheel acceleration cal culation to obtain a result useful in anti skid control operation, Preferably, the anti skid brake control system is provided a plurality of digital processors, each of which is adapted to perform anti skid brake control operations for a correspond ing vehicle wheel or wheel set. Each of the digital processors can operate independently of the others and independently produces control signals for optimizing the braking charac teristics of the corresponding wheel.
