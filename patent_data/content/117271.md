## Description
A THREE WAY VALVEThis invention relates to an improved three way valve having a plug with curved surface turned by a stem.Three way valves have been known in the art for quite some time, such as L type, T type, Y type three way ball valves, and the improved Y type three way ball valve invented byKITUMURA VALVE COMPANY. They all have a ball plug turned by a stem. The turning central line of the plug of the three way valves in the art is vertical to the plane formed by the central lines of the two tubes to be cut off or exchanged. These types of three way valves have J the following drawbacks 1. As for L and T type three way valves, the angle between the two tubes to be cut off or exchanged is 90 degrees, and the angle between the two tubes of Y type three way valve is 120 degrees, thus, the arrangement of tubes is restricted and technological requirements are high.2. When fluid medium flows through an L type three way ball valve, it has to make a turn of 90 degrees when fluid medium flows through T type three way ball valve, it has, in one passage, to make a turn of 90 degrees when fluid medium flows through Y type three way ball valve2 it has, in one passage, to make a turn of 90 degrees when fluid medium flows through Y type three way ball valve, it has to make a turn of 60 degrees. The bigger the degree the fluid medium turns in the passage, the more the loss due to flow resistance will be. In the case of a powder fluid medium, it may settle at the corner and block the plug hole.3. The KITUMURA VALVE COMPANY has improved a Y type threeway ball valve by making a winding and smooth channel in the plug. This improvement facilitates the motion of fluid medium, but fluid medium still has to make a turn of 90 degrees in the passage. The total loss due to flow resistance is not reduced, and it is difficult to process the winding hole. 4. In the present fluid transportation systems, in most cases, double cut off valves are used to cut off and change lines in few cases, one three way ball valve and one cutoff valve are used. However, either cut off valve or three way ball valve in the art only has one function, and is not able to perform the functions of both cut off and change simultaneously.The invention as claimed is intended to remedy these drawbacks. It solves the problem of how to design a three way valve, which can make it possible to choose any angle between the two ducts or tubes to be cut off or exchanged according to the particular situation which enables the fluid medium to make a small turn and reduces the loss due to flow resistance in the passage, and which has the functions of both cut off and change. It, therefore, is an object of this invention to provide an improved threeway valve which shows these properties.According to the invention a three way valve comprising a valve body consisting of one or more body sections and outwardly connected to a first duct and a second duct to be cut off or alternatively brought into communication with a third duct also connected to the valve body, a plug mounted rotatably about an axis of rotation within the valve body and containing an interconnection channel for alternatively interconnecting one of the first or second ducts with the third duct, and driving means for turning the plug via a stem which is connected at one end to the plug and at the other end to the driving means is designed such that the axis of rotation of the plug is inclined to the plane formed by the central lines of the first duct and the second duct at an angle different from 90 degrees, and that a plurality of seats is sealingly arranged between the valve body and the plug at the mounds of the ducts facing the plug.In the valve according to the invention, the turning central line of the plug is not vertical to the plane formed by the central lines of the two ducts to be cut off or exchanged. Owing to the peculiar position of the turning central line of its plug, this improved three way valve makes it possible to choose any angle between the first and second ducts according to the particular situation and to keep one straight line it enables the fluid medium to make a small turn in the passage, thus reducing the loss due to flow resistance it makes it possible that any kind of fluid medium will not block the plug channel and that it also has the functions of both cut off and change.Since the plug channel for this improved three way valve is straight, it is easy to process. Accordingly, the three way valve of the present invention includes a plug with curved surface, a body, seats, a stem and driving means connected with the stem.The valve body is the supporting case for all the components of the valve. It is outwardly connected to ducts to be cut off or exchanged. The valve body may be in two sections, that is, a left hand body section and a right hand body section. However, a big sized three way valve may have one or more intermediate body sections. Seats are mounted in the body sections. The plug is the key part of this invention.Its turning central line is not vertical to the plane formed by the central lines of the first and second ducts to be cut off or exchanged. The angle between the first duct and the second duct may be any degree in order to suit the needs of the overall arrangement in the system. The plug may either cut off or change the two tubes.The outer end of the stem is connected to driving means, which may, for instance, be manual, electric, pneumatic or hydraulic.The plug for this invention has a curved surface, whose axis of rotation is not vertical to the plane formed by the central lines of the first and second ducts. As a result, it has the following characteristics the angle between the first and second ducts may be any degree so as to meet the particular installation requirements, the turning range of the fluid medium in the passage is small, thus reducing the loss due to flow resistance the plug is easy to process, since the plug channel is a straight ane f2uidniiini can move smoothly through the plug and will not block the plug hole, and this feature will become particularly significant when the fluid medium is in powder form the valve according to the invention has the functions of both cut off and change, thus reducing the number of valves to be used in the system and making it simple since the stem is within the plane formed by the central lines of the first and second ducts, the valve occupies a small space and makes its operation easy as the moment of the stem is small, the driving means may be relatively small powered accordingly since the valve has a compact structure, it is not very heavy in weight and not very big in size either. This feature will become prominent in case of big sized three way valves.Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following detailed description of a specific embodiment, the appended claims and the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating the principle of the present invention Figure 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating the plug in the position of cut off Figure 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating the position of the central axis of rotation of the plug Figure 4 is a schematic plan section view illustrating the position of each main part Figure 5 is a partial section view of one seat illustrating the structure of the seat Figure 6 is a partial section view of the sealing device for the stem.The working principle of the valve according to theiention is explained in the following in connection with the schematic embodiment shown in Figures 1 to 3. As viewed in Figure 1, Ti, T2 and T3 are the ducts to be cut off or exchanged. Ducts T1 and T3 have a common central line. The central line of duct T2 intersects that of ducts T1 and T3 at point 0 , making an angle K . 2 is a plug which is ahemisphere. The plug may turn around axis IS There is a straight channel d in plug 2. The central line of plug channel d and the axis I make an angle which equals half of angle As viewed in Figure 1, when channel d is connected to ducts T2 and T3, ducts T2 and T3 are connected through. When plug 2 turns 180 degrees, channel d is connected to duct Tri and T3, and ducts T1 and T3 are connected through forming a most desirable straight line, while duct T2 is cut off.As viewed in Figure 2, when plug 2 turns 90 degrees, channel d is not connected to either duct Tl or duct T2, and ducts T1 and T2 are cut off from duct T3 simultaneously.Theoretically speaking, the angle formed by the central lines of duct T1 and duct T2 can be any degree ranging from 9p degrees to less than 90. Obviously, the smaller angles is, the smaller turn the fluid medium makes and the less the loss due to flow resistance will be. However, the degree of angle K is restricted by the dimension of the structure of the valve. Therefore, when there is no special requirement for angle X, the best choice is 45 degrees.The above description is based on the assumption that axis I I is within the plane formed by the central lines of ducts T1 and T2 See Figure 1 , and that axis I I is the bisector of angle o , that is the axis of plug 2. The position of axis I I as described above is the best mode of the present invention The standard structure of the present invention is to be designed according to the above principle.Where there is special installation requirement for ducts in the system, for example, if it is required that the central axis of rotation of the plug be not in the plane formed by the central lines of ducts T1 and T2 See Figure 3 , the central axis of rotation is within the bisected plane of the angle between the central lines of ducts T1 and T2 and also passes through point 0 intersected by the central lines of diets T1 and T2. As a special case, axis I I may be any straight line passing through point 0 . In the following a detailed description of an embodiment of a valve according to the invention is given Figure 4 is a schematic plan section view of an example of a valve embodiment according to the present invention illustrating the position of each main part. Body 1 is in two sections, that is, a left hand body section and a right hand body section. As for big sized three way valves, intermediate body sections may be added so as to facilitate processing and assembling. The body sections are outwardly connected to ducts in the form of tubes to be cut off or exchanged.Plug 2 is a hemisphere or any other quadratic surface .Plug channel d is a straight one, which is easy to process and ensures a necessary surface finish. In the case of big sized three way valves,a hollow plug may be desirable. Plug 2 is supported in body 1 by carrier 4. Carrier 4 may be a sliding bearing, which may be a plastic one, a selflubricating one or a bearing made of a wear resisting alloy. As for big sized three way valves, ball bearings that can bear radial charges should be used because the plug may be affected by a side force as a result of the movement of the fluid medium. Stem 5 is mounted on the flange of the body. One of its ends is connected to plug 2, so that when it is driven, plug 2 turns accordingly in body 1. As illustrated in Figure 4, fluid medium in tube T2 passes through plug 2 and turns an angle at the joint of plug 2 and body 1, then enters into tube T3.When plug 2 turns 180 degrees, the straight plug channel is connected with tube T1 and tubes T1 and T3 are connected through making a straight line. Fluid medium in tube T1 passes through the straight channel of plug 2, then enters into tube T3 directly without making any turn. The other end of stem 5 is connected to driving means including a reducer, a direction changing system and an indication device . The driving means may be manual, electric, pneumatic or hydraulic. Seat 3 is mounted in body 1 performing the function of sealing and partially supporting. There are valve seats of two different dimensions to choose. As described inFigure 5, seat 3 is inlaid in carrier 6 and is tightly pressed onto the curved surface of plug 2 by spring 7.Sealing washer 8 is of standard design, which is available on the market. In the case of small sized three way valves, seat 3 may be mounted on body 1 directly.Figure 6 is a sectional view of a typical sealing device for stem 5. The sealing device consists of gland 9, upper packing 10, middle packing 11 and packing washer 12. The sealing degree may be regulated by turning gland 9.
