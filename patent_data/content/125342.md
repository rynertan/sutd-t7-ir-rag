# Process for preparation of aromatic polycarboxylic acids and intermediates therefor.

## Abstract
A method is described for autoxidizing particular ortho dialkyl substituted aromatic compounds using a particular type of solvent which gives rise to the formation of 3 alkanoyloxyphthalide compounds, some of which are novel. The phthalides in turn are ionically oxidized to their corresponding aromatic polycarboxylic acids. Combination of the two methods provides a means for converting ortho dialkyl substituted aromatic compounds directly to the corresponding polycarboxylic acids in higher yields and at generally lower overall temperatures and reaction conditions compared to prior art methods. Polycarboxylic acids so obtained are known to be useful in the preparation of alkyds, polyesters, and the like, and, particularly, in the formation of the corresponding acid anhydrides which are used in the preparation of organic high temperature polymers such as polyamides, polyamide imides, and polyimides.
