Furthermore, the engagement mem ber 19 has a release portion 21 located outside the channel shaped receptacle portion so that a displacement force may be applied to move the engagement element 20 out of latching engagement with the tab, the en gagement element 20 being biased into its latching position. Optionally an insulating housing preferably hav ing a cam surface for engaging with the release portion 21 is provided, longitudinal relative movement between the housing and tab receptacle being effected to cause the cam surface to engage the release portion.
