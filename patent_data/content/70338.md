## Description
This invention relates to the provision of a shockabsorbing backing material for the crushing parts or components of crushing, material reducing, grinding and like machines. In crushing machines either of the moving jaw or revolving cone type, it is known to provide the crushing parts or components which are subject to wear, e.g. the jaws of stone crushers and gyratory type crushers, with a backing of shockabsorbing material. This material is generally provided by pouring a suitably formulated liquid into the cavity between the head, mantle or jaw backing and the part which is subject to wear, e.g.the jaw, and allowing the liquid to set in situ. In the past, zinc or solder has been used as the backing material but more recently there has been a trend towards cold curing synthetic resins whose use obviates many of the disadvantages associated with having to handle metals in the molten state. One preferred class of materials comprises the filled polyurethane resins such as described in our British Patent Specifications 1148406 and 1502279. These materials are obtained by mixing together a a liquid component containing the polyol and b a polyisocyanate component, to form a cold curing liquid system which is then immediately poured into the cavity where it sets in situ within a short time after mixing. The polyol containing component usually also contains the filler material and any catalyst that is used to accelerate the setting action. While these filled polyurethane resins are widely employed and have been found to be generally satisfactory in use, it would be advantageous to improve the flow properties, especially at low ambient temperatures, of the cold curing liquid system. However, any such improvement should not increase any tendency hereinafter referred to as the settling out tendency of the solid filler to settle out from the liquid component containing it, during storage and transportation thereof, and should not adversely affect the pot life of the cold curing system or the compressive strength and flexibility of the cured product. In accordance with the present invention, the filled polyurethane resin composition is derived from a cold curing liquid system formed by mixing together a a liquid material comprising the polyol component and at least part and preferably all or substantially all of the filler in the composition and wherein the polyol component comprises i one or more polyether polyols each having at least two hydroxyl groups per molecule, the average number of hydroxyl groups per molecule being more than 2 but not more than 3.3, ii one or more polyols each having at least two hydroxyl groups per molecule and containing both ether and ester groups, the average number of hydroxyl groups per molecule being more than 2 but not more than 3.3, and iii at least one ester of a long chain hydroxylated fatty acid having at least 10 and preferably 12 to 14 carbon atoms including the carboxylic carbon atom i and ii being present in amounts such that i provides from 1.5 to 3.5 hydroxy groups for each hydroxy group provided by ii , and iii being present in an amount of 2 to 10 by weight of said liquid material, and b at least one aromatic polyisocyanate in an amount such that there is an excess of isocyanate groups over hydroxyl groups in the cold curing system, and said liquid material also includes a quaternary ammonium smectite, as hereinafter defined, in an amount of from 0.2 to 2 by weight of the liquid material. The presence in combination of the ester and the quaternary ammonium smectite in the liquid material within the strict limits of the ranges specified herein produces on admixture with.the polyisocyanate constituent a cold curing system having improved flow properties as compared with previsouly described polyurethanebased cold curing systems at comparable levels of solids content and this improvement can be obtained without any increase in the tendency of the filler in the liquid material to settle out during transport and or storage. In fact, in general the liquid materials employed in the present invention show a reduced tendency to settlingout of the solids materials therein even though the viscosity of the cold curing system is reduced. Moreover, any solids that do settle out on storage or transport tpnd to be more easily redispersed.Furthermore these advantages can be gained without any significant adverse effect upon the pot life of the cold curing system or the compressive strength or flexibility of the cured product. Preferably, the proportions of constituent i and the constituent ii are such that the former provides approximately 2 to 3 hydroxyl groups for each hydroxyl group provided by the latter. The molecular weights of constituents i and ii are preferably at least 500 and may be greater than 1000, e.g. up to 2000 or more. However, they preferably contain at least 2 to 3 OH, e.g. from 4 to 20 OH, by weight. Constituent iii comprises at least one ester of a hydroxylated long chain fatty acid which may be saturated or unsaturated provided that it contains at least one, and preferably only one, hydroxyl group capabLe of reacting with an isocyanate to form a urethane. The ester may be of a monohydric alcohol or a polyhydric alcohol and is preferably a glyceride. One example which is preferred on graunds of ready availability and cost is caster oil. The aromatic polyisocyanate may be, for example, one or a mixture of toluene diisocyanate isomers or a compound or compounds containing two or more isocyanatophenyl groups, e.g. a bis isocyanatophenyl alkane such as bis 4 isocyanatophenyl methane or 1,1bis 4 isocyanatophenyl propane. Although other filler materials such as carbonaceous material and finely divided metals, e.g. aluminium and or steel powder, may be used, it is preferred that the filler, or at least a major proportion thereof, is of mineral origin. Examples of such fillers are finely divided slate, clays, sands, metal oxides, metal salts or inorganic acids, e.g. barium sulphate, calcined metal salts, e.g. calcined malachite, and finely divided glass, e.g. fibrous glass or powdered glass. The filler preferably forms a major proportion by weight of the liquid material. However, at high levels of filler, dispersion of the filler within the other components of the liquid material becomes increasingly difficult and for this reason the use of filler in amounts exceeding 85 by weight of the liquid material is not advised.The preferred range is from 60 to 80 by weight of the liquid material. The liquid material also includes a quaternary ammonium smectite by which is meant a smectic clay mineral at least part of the metal cation content of which has been replaced by quaternary ammonium groups. Examples of smectic clay minerals include beidellite, hectorite, montmorillonite, nontronite, saponite and sauconite. The quaternary ammonium cation preferably contains at least one long chain e.g. containing at least 10 carbon atoms in the chain alkyl group e.g. as in decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, hexadecyl, octadecyl, cetyl and eicosyl. The remaining valencies of the quaternary ammonium cation may be alkyl or aralkyl groups, e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, t butyl, amyl and benzyl. This quaternary ammonium smectite must be present in an amount of from 0.2 to 2 by weight of the liquid material. Within the ranges specified above, the amounts of ester and quaternary ammonium smectite employed for the best results are inter related and depend also upon the concentration of filler in the liquid material. Increasing the concentration of the filler in the liquid material increases the viscosity of the cold curing system but this can be offset by increasing the concentration of the ester. However, such increase tends to increase the tendency of the filler to settle out and moreover using too much ester can lead to undesirable phase separation of the liquid phase of the liquid material and should be avoided. In general, ester concentrations greater than 7 by weight of the liquid material should not be used and the preferred range of concentration is 3 to 7 by weight of the liquid material comprising the polyol component and the filler.For this reason, it is preferred to avoid filler concentrations much above 80 by weight of the liquid material. Increasing the quantity of the quaternary ammonium smectite reduces the tendency of the filler to settle out but markedly increases the viscosity of the liquid material however, very small amounts of the smectite are efficient in reducing the tendency of the filler to settle qut and in general only from 0.5 to 1.5 preferably 0.5 to 1 by weight of this component is required and it is preferred to use the minimum that is effective.It is preferred that the viscosity of the filler containing liquid material measured using a Brookfield Viscometer, Spindle 4, Speed 5 at 250C is 160 190 poises. Other additives may lso be included in the cold curing system and, if employed, are generally incorporated in the liquid material. Examples are accelerators for the resin forming reaction and dehydrators which may be, for example, materials which react with moisture or which physically adsorb our absorb it, e.g.molecular sieves such as zeolites. The liquid material and the polyisocyanate constituent are mixed together just before use because the curing reaction, which eventually results in the polyol components and the polyisocyanate constituent forming a solid mass, commences quite soon after contact between these materials. If any of the components of the liquid material are incompatible with each other, they should not be mixed together until just before mixture of the liquid material with the polyisocyanate constituent. Suitably, the filler material, additives if any, and polyether polyol are first mixed together and then the other two polyol constituents are added to this mixture, preferably as a preformed mixture, to form, the liquid material. In order to facilitate rapid removal of the metal portion when worn from a machine, a release agent such as silicone oil can be applied to the wearable metal portion prior to the application of the backing material, so as to prevent adherence of the backing material to the metal portion. The backing material is especially suitable for use with machine parts and components used in gyratory crushers. An example of the machine part or component in accordance with the invention for use in a gyratory crusher is shown in the accompanying drawing which is a part cut away view of a gyratory crusher having a wearable metal portion. The drawing shows part of a crushing head or inner core 1 and an outer mantle 2. The crushing head 1 has a lining of wear resistant material such as steel or a manganese steel alloy on its surface. The ingredients forming the backing material are mixed to form a liquid material 3, which is then poured into the cavity between the head and the mantle where it sets to form a solid backing material 4. In operation the mantle 2 is placed over the head 1, leaving a space between the two components. The ingredients forming the backing material are mixed to form the liquid material 3 which is then poured into the space until it is completely filled, and sets therein to form a solid backing material 4. If desired, a release agent such as silicone oil can be applied to the head 1 to prevent adherence of the backing material 4 thereto. The same release agent can at the same time be applied to any bolts used, to prevent adherence. The invention is now illustrated by the following Examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight. Example l A liquid material A was prepared by mixing together 1. Branched polyether polyols having approximately three OH groups per molecule and an OH content of approximately 11.5 by weight UcIPOL 3541 12.65 parts 2. Branched polyalcohols containing ether and ester groups and having approximately three OH groups per molecule and an OH content of approximately 5 UGIPOL 1010 12.65 parts 3. Filler Barytes up to 100 mesh 69.0 parts 4. Zinc Naphthenate 0.5 part 5. Zeolith T.Paste Bayer UK 5.2 parts Total 100.0 parts The cold curing mixture obtained by mixing 4.2 kg of the liquid material with 0.8kg of an aromatic polyisocyanate containing approximately 30 by weight NCO has a pot life of approximately 40 minutes at 18 20 C and on curing provides a backing material with acceptable compressive strength and flexibility. However said cold curing mixture was not readily pourable and it was found that the viscosity of the liquid material, prior to mixing with the polyisocyanate, was too high at 216 poises measured using a Brookfield Viscometer with Spindle No. 4 at Speed 5 at 25 0C. A second liquid material B was formed by replacing 1.0 part of the filler with 1.0 part of Bentone 27, a quaternary ammonium smectite marketed by NL Industries Inc of Hightstown, N.J, U S A and including 4 parts of caster oil having the following properties I2 value 82 90 acid value 2.0 max S.G. 0.968 0.965 SAP value 177 187 R.I commat 200C 1.4771 1.4810 H2O content 0.001 The liquid material B had a viscosity, measured as above, of only 170 and on mixing in the same quantities with the polyisocyanate produced a cold curing mixture of improved pourability and substantially unchanged pot life. The compressive strength and flexibility of the backing material obtained from the cold curing mIxture were substantially unchanged. When samples of materials A and B were left to stand, the rate at which a clear upper phase developed in B was less than that of A, indicating a lower rate of settling out of the solids content despite the lower viscosity. The solids that had settled out in B were easily redispersed by stirring. EXAMPLES 2 The composition of liquid material A was modified by increasing the amount of filler to 75.0 parts and reducing the amounts of components 1 and 2 to 9.65 parts each. The liquid so formed had an unacceptably high viscosity of 524 poises. This composition was then further modified by replacing 1.5 parts of the filler by an equal weight of Bentone 27 and adding 5.0 parts of the caster oil used in Example 1. The liquid material so obtained had a viscosity of only 184 poises and on mixing with 145 parts of the aromatic polyisocyanate employed in Example 1 provided a cold curing mixture having adequate pourability. The pot life of the cold curing mixture and the compressive strength and flexibility of the backing material obtained from it were not substantially different from those of liquid material A. The rate at which solids settled out from the second composition was observed to be lower than that observed for the first composition.
