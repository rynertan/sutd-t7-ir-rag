# Implant with attachment surface.

## Abstract
An implant for use in a human body having an integral attachment surface adapted to permit tissue ingrowth. The attachment surface has an inner attachment surface and a multiplicity of spaced posts projecting from the inner attach ment surface. The posts each have side attachment surfaces which are generally cylindrically concave, intersect to define post edges, and are radiused at their intersections with the inner attachment surface. A method of forming the attach ment surface on an implant with a laser is also included.
