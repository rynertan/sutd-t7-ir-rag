## Abstract
A right angle coaxial connector comprises a metal body member 28 having a dielectric member 20 secured along a passageway 26 extending through the body member 28 . A center contact member 12 is secured in the dielectric member 20 and includes a contact section 14 and a U shaped ferrule section 16 the contact section 14 is adapted to nest in a contact receiving die 66 of a crimping tool 60 and the ferrule section 16 is in alignment with an open end of the body member 28 permitting access by a crimping die 70 of the crimping tool 60 to crimp the U shaped ferrule section 16 onto a center con ductor 54 of a coaxial cable 50 while simultaneously crimping a crimping ferrule 56 of an outer conductor 48 of the coaxial cable 50 onto a tubular member 44 at right angles to the body member 28 and in alignment with the ferrule section 16 .
