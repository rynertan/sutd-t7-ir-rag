## Description
LEUKOTRIENE ANTAGONISTS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Slow Reacting Substance of Anaphylaxis SRS A has been shown to be a highly potent bronchoconstricting substance which is released primarily from mast cells and basophils on antigenic challenge. SRS A has been proposed as a primary mediator in human asthma. SRS A, in addition to its pronounced effects on lung tissue, also produces permeability changes in skin and may be involved in acute cutaneous allergic reactions. Further, SRS A has been shown to effect depression of ventricular contraction and potentiation of the cardiovascular effects of histamine. The discovery of the naturally occurring leukotrienes and their relationship to SRS A has reinforced interest in SRS A and other arachidonate metabolites. SRS A derived from mouse, rat, guinea pig and man have all been characterized as mixtures of leukotriene C4 LTC4 , leukotriene D4 LTD4 and leukotriene E4 tTE4 , the structural formulae of which are represented below. EMI2.1 EMI2.2 LTD4 R Cys GlyLTE4 RN X Cys By antagonizing the effects of LTC4, LTD4 andLTE4 or other pharmacologically active mediators at the end organ, e.g. airway smooth muscle, the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the instant invention are valuable in the treatment of diseases in which leukotrienes are a factor, such as asthma.

The compounds of the formula III contain two asymmetric centers, one of which is at carbon atom 4 i.e. the hydroxyl substituted carbon atom and one of which is at carbon atom 5 i.e. the thio substituted carbon atom .This leads to the possibility of four stereoisomers for each compound. In practice, the compounds of this invention of formula III have been prepared as a mixture of two stereoisomers, that is the 4R, 5S isomer and the 4S, 5R isomer. The individual pure stereoisomers are obtainable by preparative high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC separation of the appropriate intermediate compounds if those compounds possess a third asymmetric center. A third asymmetric center may be introduced by employing in the synthetic pathway of the desired compounds an asymmetric protecting group, such as an N trichloroethoxycarbonylprolyl ester. After separation into the individual stereoisomers, the group containing the third asymmetric center is removed by standard procedures. Representative of these 6 Z nonadecenoic acid derivatives are the compounds of the formula III whereinR1 is an alkyl radical containing from one to four carbon atoms or an alkenyl radical containing three to four carbon atoms, and, in particular, wherein R1 is a methyl, ethyl or allyl substitutent.These 5 l alkyl 2 imidazolylthio 6 Z nonadecenoic acid and 5 l alkenyl 2 imidazolylthio 6 Z nonadecenoic acid derivatives are exemplified by the following compounds A where R2 is hydrogen 1 4 hydroxy 5 l methyl 2 imidazolylthio 6 Z nonadecenoic acid Formula III wherein Rl is methyl and both R2 and R3 are hydrogen , 2 4 hydroxy 5 l methyl 4 carboxymethyl 2 imidazolylthio 6 Z nonadecenoic acid Formula III wherein R1 is methyl, R2 is hydrogen and R3 is GH2C02H 3 4 hydroxy 5 l ethyl 2 imidazolylthio 6 Z nonadecenoic acid Formula III wherein R1 is ethyl and both R2 and R3 are hydrogen and 4 4 hydroxy 5 l allyl 2 imidazolylthio 6 Z nonadecenoic acid Formula III wherein R1 is allyl and both R2 and R3 are hydrogen and B where R2 is a carboxyl radical 1 4 hydroxy 5 l methyl 5 carboxy 2 imidazolylthio 6 Z nonadecenoic acid Formula III wherein R1 is methyl, R2 is C02H and R3 is hydrogen and 2 4 hydroxy 5 1,4 dimethyl 5 carboxy 2 imidazolylthio 6 Z nonadecenoic acid Formula III wherein both R1 and R3 are methyl and R2 is C02H as the 4R,5S isomer, the 4S,5R isomer or a mixture of the two isomers and C where R2 is a carboxamido radical 1 4 hydroxy 5 l methyl 5 carboxamido 2 imidazolylthio 6 Z nonadecenoic acid Formula III wherein R1 is methyl, R2 is CONH2 and R3 is hydrogen and D where R2 is methyl 1 4 hydroxy 5 l,4,5 trimethyl 2 imidazolyl thio 6 Z nonadecenoic acid Formula III wherein R1, R2 and R3 are methyl and E where R2 is carboxymethyl 1 4 hydroxy 5 l methyl 5 carboxymethyl 2 imidazolylthio 6 Z nonadecenoic acid Formula III wherein R1 is methyl, R2 is CH2CO2H and R3 is hydrogen .

The tissues were connected via silk suture to force displacement transducers for recording isometric tension.The tissues were equilibrated for 1 hr., pretreated for 15 minutes with meclofenamic acid 1 M to remove intrinsic prostaglandin responses, and then pretreated for an additional 30 minutes with either the test compound or vehicle control. A cumulative concentration response curve for LTD4 on triplicate tissues was generated by successive increases in the bath concentration of theLTD4. In order to minimize intertissue variability, the contractions elicited by LTD4 were standardized as a percentage of the maximum response obtained to a reference agonist, carbachol 10 M . Calculations The averages of the triplicate LTD4 concentration response curves both in the presence and absence of the test compound were plotted on log graph paper. The concentration of LTD4 needed to elicit 30 of the contraction elicited by carbachol was measured and defined as the EC30. The log g value for the test compound was determined by the following equations 1.

Alternatively the compositions will comprise a suspension or solution of the active ingredient in a conventional liquified propellant or compressed gas to be administered from a pressurized aerosol container. The compositions may also comprise the solid active ingredient diluted with a solid diluent for administration from a powder inhalation device. In the above compositions, the amount of carrier or diluent will vary but preferably will be the major proportion of a suspension or solution of the active ingredient.When the diluent is a solid it may be present in less, equal or greater amounts than the solid active ingredient. For parenteral administration the pharmaceutical composition will be in the form of a sterile injectable liquid such as an ampul or an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid suspension. For topical administration the pharmaceutical composition will be in the form of a cream or ointment. Usually a compound of the formulae I or IA is administered to an animal subject in a composition comprising a nontoxic amount sufficient to antagonize the leukotriene effects, such as to produce an inhibition of the symptoms of an allergic response. When employed in this manner, the dosage of the composition is selected from the range of from 350 mg. to 700 mg. of active ingredient for each administration. For convenience, equal doses will be administered 1 to 4 times daily with the daily dosage regimen being selected from about 350 mg.to about 2800 mg. The pharmaceutical preparations thus described are made following the conventional techniques of the pharmaceutical chemist as appropriate to the desired end product. Included within the scope of this disclosure is a method of antagonizing leukotriene effects, such as the method of inhibiting the symptoms of an allergic response resulting from a mediator release, which comprises administering to an animal subject a nontoxic effective amount for producing said antagonism of a compound of the formulae I or IA preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. The administration may be carried out in dosage units at suitable intervals or in single doses as needed. Usually this method will be practiced when relief of allergic symptoms is specifically required. However, the method is also usefully carried out as continuous or prophylactic treatment.It is within the skill of the art to determine by routine experimentation the effective dosage to be administered from the dose range set forth above, taking into consideration such factors as the degree of severity of the allergic condition being treated, and so forth. The following examples illustrate the preparation of the compounds of this invention and their incorporation into pharmaceutical compositions and as such are not to be considered as limiting the invention set forth in the claims appended hereto.
