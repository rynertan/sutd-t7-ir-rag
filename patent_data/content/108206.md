# Vacuum Chamber.

## Abstract
The apparatus features an energy coaxial feedthrough 52 fix mounted in a wall 23 of a vacuum chamber 28 for supplying electrical and mechanical energy from sources located externally of the vacuum chamber to a substrate holder 44 within the vacuum chamber. The apparatus includes a movable coaxial coupler 54 capable of releasably engaging the coaxial feedthrough and releasably latching a substrate holder 44 . The apparatus also includes a linkage assembly 56 located within the chamber connected to the coupler so that the coupler may be located in a first position proximate an access port 30 in the chamber wall to facilitate quick and convenient loading of the substrate holder and a second position in which the coupler is connected to the feedthrough for transmitting electrical and mechanical ener gy to the substrate holder and the substrates thereon.
