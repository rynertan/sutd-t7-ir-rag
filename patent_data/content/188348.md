# ROLLING MILL ROLL STANDS

## Abstract
A rolling mill roll stand has a housing removably mounted on a bridge support. A pair of work rolls and their respective bearings and bearing chocks are contained within the housing. Separating devices act on the bearing chocks to maintain a gap between the work rolls. Hydraulic roll positioning cylinders are carried in the bridge support and are arranged to act on the bearing chocks of one of the work rolls. The housing together with the work rolls, bearing chocks and separating devices is removable as a unit from the bridge support, while allowing the hydraulic positioning cylinders to remain undisturbed.
