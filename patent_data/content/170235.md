## Description
CONTINUOUS DRYING OF POLY 2 ACRYLAMIDO 2 METHYLPROPANESULFONIC ACID AND SALTS THEREOF BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method of continuous drying of certain acrylic polymers. More particularly, this invention relates to the drum drying or heated extrusion drying of poly v acrylamido 2 methylpropane sulfonic acid or its salts. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART U.S. Patent 3,931,089 discloses that a homopolymer of 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid or its salts is useful as a stable thickener in highly acidic aqueous solutions. U.S. Patent 4,065,422 discloses that homopolymers of salts of 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid impart lubricity to alcohol based compositions. These homopolymers are prepared by the redox polymerization of the monomer in aqueous solution. The homopolymerization of the monomer in aqueous solution yields a viscous aqueous composition that is dried to obtain the homopolymer. Previous methods of drying the homopolymer have been limited to batch methods whereby a thin layer of the homopolymer was spread on trays and freeze dried, air dried, or vacuum oven dried. When dry, the hardened layer was loosened from the tray and then ground to obtain a glossy crystalline product having a relatively large particle size. An article in Kirk Othmer, Encyclopedia ofChemical Technology, Vol. 8, page 108 3rd ed.,1979, John Wiley Sons, New York, NY discloses that drum drying has been used to produce acceptable milk powders. Drum drying is effected by applying a thin film of slurry or solution to the outer surface of a rotating heated drum by means of applicator rolls, spray nozzles, or by dipping the drum into a pan containing the liquid. The dried product is removed from the back side of the drum by a spring loaded doctor knife. It is an object of the present invention to provide a continuous method for the drying of homopolymers of 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid or salts thereof. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the continuous drying of homopolymers of 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid or salts thereof. It has been found that the method of continuous drying of these homopolymers, as disclosed herein, yields a sufficiently dried homopolymer that has a smaller particle size than that produced by previous drying methods. The continuous drying of the homopolymer is accompolished by continuously feeding a solution of the homopolymer into a heating zone in which at least a portion of the solution is in contact with a metal surface that is in motion about an axis and then continuously collecting dried homopolymer at a distance from the point of feed. The preferred means of continuous drying are drum drying and drying by heated extrusion. In a drum dryer, the metal surface is the exterior of the drum and the heating zone is the volume of space occupied by the thin layer of solution of the homopolymer applied to the drum. In an extruder, the metal surface is the flange of an extruder screw and the heating zone is the volume of space within the extruder that is occupied by the solution of the homopolymer. The motion of the metal surface about an axis moves the homopolymer solu tion, as it is heated, to a point distant from the point of feed, allowing for continuous introduction of homopolymer and removal of same from the heating zone. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Homopolymers of acrylamidomethylpropanesulfonic acid or salts thereof are prepared by the redox polymerization of the monomer in aqueous solution as disclosed in U.S. Patent No s. 3,931,089 and 4,065,422.These homopolymers have molecular weights in the range of one million to five million and form viscous aqueous solutions. When a drum dryer is used to dry a homopolymer in accordance with this invention, the concentration of the homopolymer in the viscous solutions generally ranges from about 5 to about 75 by the weight of the solution. The concentration of the homopolymer to be dried by a drum dryer preferably ranges from about 15 to about 45 and most preferably from about 15 to about 25 . When an extruder is used to dry a homopolymer in accordance with this invention, the concentration of the homopolymer generally ranges from about 15 to about 75 , preferably from about 25 to about 75 and most preferably from about 50 to about 75 . The homopolymer of the acid form of acrylamidomethylpropanesulfonic acid is highly acidic. Because t the acid form of the homopolymer is highly acidic, the surfaces of a drum dryer or extruder in contact with the homopolymer are preferably constructed of corrosion resistant materials. In the alternative, i.e. if the metal surfaces of the drum dryer or extruder used in the method of this invention are susceptible to corrosion, it is preferred that a homopolymer of a salt of the acid be dried in accordance with the method of this invention. Suitable salts include the alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium and potassium, the ammonium salt, and the organic amine salts, e.g. monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, and triethanolamine. The preferred means of continuously drying the solutions of homopolymers in accordance with this invention are drum drying and drying by heated extrusion. As noted earlier, drum drying is effected by applying a thin film of solution of the homopolymer to the outer surface of a rotating heated drum. Because of the relatively high viscosity of the homopolymer solutions, the solution is preferably applied to the drum by means of applicator rolls or by dipping the drum into a pan containing the solution. The drum rotational speed and temperature is selected such that sufficient drying has occurred after only a few seconds whereupon the dried homopolymer can be removed from the drum. For example, with a drum having a diameter of 1 meter the rotational speeds may range from about 3 rpm to about 8 rpm and the drum temperature may range from about 1600C to about 1740C. The preferred method of removing the dried homopolymer from the drum is by the use of a spring loaded doctor knife. Single, twin, and double drum dryers can be used. A twin drum dryer consists of two single drums operated in parallel, usually with a common feed system. On a double drum dryer, the feed is retained and partially concentrated in the reservoir formed by the nip between the drums. The clearance between the drums is adjusted to control the film thickness. Liquid is conveyed through the clearance, dried, and the product is removed from the back sides of the drums, preferably by doctor knives. It has been found that the drum drying of the solutions of homopolymers of this invention generally yields a dried granular material that usually contains from about 3 to about 6 water. Drying by heated extrusion has also been found to be effective in the practice of this invention. Heated extrusion drying is effected by continuously feeding a solution of the homopolymer into the inlet of an extruder fitted with a heated barrel and continuously collecting the dried homopolymer as it exits the extruder. The extruder may be a single or twin screw extruder fitted with a barren that may be heated to maintain a barrel temperature between about 750C and about 3000C, preferably between about 1000C and about 2000C and most preferably between about 1000C and about 1500C. The heated barrel heats the contents of the extruder to volatilize the solvent contained in the homopolymer solution. The extruder barrel may be vented to allow the escape of the solvent of the solution of homopolymer.If the extruder barrel is not vented, the solvent is volatilized, e.g. flash evaporated, from the homopolymer as it leaves the extruder barrel. The extruder outlet may also be fitted with a dieface cutter to cut the extrudate into the desired lengths.The precise specifications and operating procedures of the extruder will depend upon the desired rate of output and the desired degree of dryness of the dried homopolymer. Because of the relatively small particle size of the dried product produced by the practice of this invention, the dried product can be immediately packaged for a variety of uses, thereby removing the necessity of further mechanical processing, e.g. grinding, before packaging. The dried product so produced is useful in a variety of applications. For example, it can be added to a variety of liquid compositions, especially aqueous compositions, as a thickening agent. EXAMPLES Example I A small sample of an aqueous solution containing 15 by weight of polyacrylamidomethylpropanesulfonic acid was diluted to 0.58 by weight polymer. The di lute solution exhibited a Brookfield viscosity t2 at about 250C of 304 cps at 2.5 rpm and 224 cps at 20 rpm and a pH of 1.1. The remainder was poured into the nip of a Laboratory Double Drum Dryer available fromBuflovak having 6 by 7 5 8 chrome plated rolls. The clearance between the drum rolls was pre set to approximately .004 and steam pressure was held at about 40 psi. The dried product was doctored from the back sides of the rolls and collected in trays. The dried product contained between 4 and 5 moisture. An aqueous solution of 0.5 by weight, on a moisture free basis, of the dried poly acrylamidomethylpropanesulfonic acid was prepared by dissolving the dried product in water. The resulting aqueous solution exhibited, after two hours, a Brookfield viscosity µ2 at 220C of 256 cps at 2.5 rpm and 202 cps at 20 rpm and a pH of 2.1. After 24 hours, the solution exhibited aBrookfield viscosity 82 at 230C of 208 cps at 2.5 rpm and 160 cps at 20 rpm and a pH of 2.3. Example II A 15 aqueous solution of poly sodium acrylamidomethylpropanesulfonate , having characteristics similar to the solution of Example I, was dried using the same equipment and procedures as in Example I. Three dried samples were collected and were dissolved in water to prepare aqueous solutions having 0. 5 polymer by weight on a moisture free basis.The water content of the dried product, the Brookfield viscosity at 220C one hour after solution, the Brookfield viscosity at 200C twenty four hours after solution, and the pH at one hour after solution are tabulated below 0.5 Aqueous Solution of Dried Poly sodium acrylamidomethylpropanesulfonate ,Sample Moisture pH rpm 1 hr 24 hr 1 5.9 6.22 2.5 416 464 20 284 300 2 5.6 6.16 2.5 400 448 20 278 292 3 5.6 6.20 2.5 400 432 20 274 290 Example III A small sample of an aqueous solution of 17.28 of poly ammonium acrylamidomethylpropanesulfonate was diluted to 0.5 by weight polymer. The resulting dilute solution had a pH of 6.41 and Brookfield viscosities µ2 at both one hour and 24 hours after dilution of 816 cps at 2.5 rpm and 434 cps at 20 rpm. The remainder of the 17.2 aqueous solution was split into two portions which were dried separately.One portion was fed via a spray bar system of the dryer to the drum of a single drum dryer having a 1 meter by 1 meter drum, available from Gouda, the spray bar fed material to the second and third nips and polymer was scraped back to fill the fourth and fifth nips. Feed overflowed onto the front nip. The dried product was doctored off the back of the drum to yield a solid material having 4.5 moisture. A 0.5 aqueous solution on a moisture free basis of the dried product exhibited a pH of 5.13, one hour solution viscosities of 544 cps at 2.5 rpm and 326 cps at 20 rpm and 24 hour solution viscosities of 528 cps at 2.5 rpm and 320 cps at 20 rpm. The other portion of the 17.2 aqueous solution was dried on the same apparatus by feeding solution to all four nips at the same time by oscillating the means of feed. The nips were kept full and the speed of the drum was gradually increased from 3 rpm to 8 rpm. This procedure produced double sheeted material and much dusting of the material. The dried product had a moisture content of 3.9 . A 0.58 moisture free basis aqueous solution had a pH of 5.03, one hour solution viscosities of 560 cps at 2.5 rpm and 338 cps at 20 rpm and 24 hour viscosities of 544 cps at 2.5 rpm and 332 cps at 20 rpm. Example IV A 15 solution of poly acrylamidomethylpropanesulfonic acid , having characteristics similar to the polymer of Example I, was fed into the in3et of a Type 150 24 extruder available from Modern Plastics having a barrel heated to 1000C. Solution was placed in the inlet port prior to the start of screw rotation to lubricate the screw. The screw speed was kept slightly below 1 rpm. Material was collected from the outlet of the barrel which was not fitted with a die. Upon exiting the extruder, the material flash evaporated a portion of the water to reduce the moisture content by about 7 on a single pass through the extruder. Multiple passes or venting of the extruder will allow for the production of dried material similar to that produced by drum drying.
