# Pipette.

## Abstract
The subject of the invention is a pipette which comprises a frame portion 1 shaped as a handle, a cylinder being formed inside the frame portion 1 , as well as a piston 5 fitted into the cylinder by means of a seal ring 7 , a piston rod 4 connected to the piston 3 , as well as a press knob 5 with shaft 6 , fitted at the upper end of the frame portion 1 . Around the shaft 6 of the press knob 5 , a calibration sleeve 9 is fitted by means of a threaded joint 8 , by means of which calibration sleeve 9 the lower limit of the movement of the piston 3 during pipetting can be determined. According to the invention, the calibration sleeve 9 , as surrounded by the mantle 10 of the hollow press knob 5 and by the upper part of the pipette frame 1 , is placed at a distance both from the mantle 10 of the press knob 5 and from the inner face of the cover of the upper part of the pipette frame 1 . Thereby the hollow press knob 5 and the pipette frame 1 form a cover protecting from conducted heat and allow a space of air around the adjustment and calibration sleeve 9 .
