## Description
APPARATUS FOR SEPARATING ENTRAINED MATTER FROM A FLOWING FLUID This invention relates to apparatus for separating entrained matter from a flowing fluid and is particularly concerned with such apparatus for use with a polymerization apparatus for finishing high viscosity synthetic condensation polymers. More particularly it relates to an apparatus for reducing entrained matter in by product gases entering the finisher. U.S. Patent No. 4,090,261 to Iwasyk describes a separator finisher apparatus suitable for use in the production of synthetic condensation polymers such as polyamides and polyesters. The apparatus disclosed in the patent is an enclosed vessel with a top plate having a vent opening and at least one polymer supply passage. The disclosure of the Iwasyk patent is incorporated herein by reference. When such an apparatus is used for the preparation of polyamides, thermal degradation and gelation tend to occur in stagnant regions of the processing vessel such as when generated molten polymer particles aerosols deposit on conduit surfaces above the vent opening and drain by gravity to the vent edge, form stalactites at the vent edge and dangle into the process space. These stalactites periodically break off to discharge degraded material contaminating the process melt pool below. According to the invention there is provided an apparatus for separating entrained matter from a flowing fluid carrying the entrained matter that includes a continuous wall forming a passage through which the fluid passes, said passage having an inlet end and an outlet end and at least one helical flight having the same twist direction throughout located in and extending longitudinally of said passage, characterized in that said passage diverges from said inlet to said outlet at an angle in the range of about 3 degrees to about 20 degrees, said helical flight being tapered to conform to the divergence of said passage. Thus, apparatus in accordance with the invention may provide a means for reducing the deposition of polymer on stagnant areas in a finisher as above by reducing the aerosol content of the steam entering the finisher. In one embodiment the flight or flights are stationary and have opposed edges in contact with the wall of the passage. Alternatively however portions of the opposed edges may be spaced from the wall, the space being thinner than the flowing fluid film thickness.Although a single flight may be used, avantageously there are provided a plurality of stationary, contiguous helical flights each having a leading edge and a trailing edge.Conveniently, the trailing edge of one flight is oriented about 900 to the leading edge of an adjacent flight, although clearly this angle may vary. The total angle of twist of the flight or flights may vary although this angle is advantageously greater than 360 where a plurality of flights are used, the angle of twist of each may conveniently be between 90 and 180 degrees. Although the passage may diverge at any angle within the specified range, in one embodiment the angle is 8 degrees. The invention extends to an apparatus for finishing synthetic polymers including an enclosed vessel a vent and at least one polymer inlet in the upper Portion of said vessel and a discharge outlet in the lower portion of said vessel, said inlet being defined by a continuous wall forming a passage diverging toward said vessel, the improvement comprising a plurality of stationary, contiguous, helical flights with adjacent flights having the same twist direction positioned in each of said polymer inlets said flights being tapered to conform to the divergence z√ßf said passage, and having a total twist greater than about 360 degrees. Certain embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIG. 1 is a vertical sectional view of one embodiment of a vessel utilizing the apparatus of this invention. FIG. 2 is an enlarged view of one of the inlets of FIG. 1. FIG. 3 is an alternate embodiment for an inlet useful with a vessel as shown in FIG. 1. Referring to FIG. 1, vessel 10, containing a polymer melt 12 is in the shape of two intersecting conical frustums and has an interior wall surface 11. Two co rotating interengaging helical screw elements 14 are supported on shafts 15. Top plate 20 contains a vent opening 24 and a pair of polymer supply passages 26. Connected to vent opening 24 is a heated duct 30 for connecting vessel 10 to an appropriate condenser system not shown . Each polymer supply passage has an inlet and an outlet end, i.e., 26a, 26b respectively. The polymer supply passages diverge from their inlet to their outlet at an angle of from about 3 to about 20 degrees. As best shown in FIG. 2, a plurality of helical flights 32, 34, 36 with the same twist direction are located and extend longitudinally in polymer supply passage 26. The flights are oriented at 90 degrees to each other, are interlocked with each other by means of notches in the leading and trailing edges of the flights, and have opposed edges running longitudinally of the passage 26 which are slightly spaced from the wall 28 of the polymer passage 26 by spacers 32a, 32b, and 36a, 36b. The gap thus provided allows liquid to flush any stagnant areas between the wall 28 of the passage 26 and the flights therein. The gap thickness should be less than the flowing liquid film thickness. As can be readily seen from the drawing, the helical flights are tapered to conform to the divergence angle A of the passage.Additionally, the flights may be secured to each other at their interlocking portions by soldering, tack welding, or brazing. The total angle of twist of the flights 32, 34, 36 should be greater than 360 degrees and preferably between 360 degrees and 540 degrees while the individual pitch of each flight should be between 18 and 28 degrees per inch with a total twist per each flight of equal to or greater than 90 degrees, preferably from 90 to 180 degrees. In an alternate embodiment shown in FIG. 3, the flights 32B, 34 , 36 , are located longitudinally in passage 26 but in this case the opposed edges of the flights are in contact with the wall 28 of the passage 26 T . Except for being in contact with the wall of the passage 26 all other parameters for the flights as described above in connection with FIG. 2 apply. In operation, two phases, a liquid polymer and steam are flowing through polymer inlet passages 26 in such a manner that the viscous polymer flow path is around the steam core. While the liquid flow is not affected by the helical flights in the passages 26, the entrained liquid aerosols in the steam impinges on the surface of the flights at initial velocities above 80 feet per second. The helical flights 32, 34, 36 being oriented 90 degrees with respect to each other divide the flow into separate streams as it moves through passage 26. The aerosols entrained in the steam impact on the surface of the flights and are collected as a liquid which flows into the vessel. The divergence of passage 26 is important because this reduces the velocity of the steam flowing through the passage to a level less than 40 ft sec 12.2 m sec where reentrainment of polymer is significantly reduced. In a series of test runs using equipment similar to that illustrated in the drawing the exit 26b aerosol entrainment was reduced by an amount of from 30 percent to 90 percent from the inlet 26a entrainment. The combination of a diverging passage with helical flights tapered to conform to the divergence of the passage can be followed by a constant diameter pipe of diameter equal to the exit diameter of the diverging passage. The pipe should also contain helical flights to increase surface area holdup time.
