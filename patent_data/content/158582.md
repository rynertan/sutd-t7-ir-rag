# DUAL PUMP DOWN CYCLE FOR PROTECTING A COMPRESSOR IN A REFRIGERATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A method and control system are disclosed for operating a refrigeration system to protect the refrigeration system compressor from flooding at startup of the refrigeration system. When the refrigeration system is to be shut down, refrigerant flow from a condenser to an evaporator of the refrigeration system is effectively closed off and the refriger ation system compressor is run for a first preselected time period sufficient to reduce the refrigerant pressure in the evaporator to a first desired, relatively low level. Then, prior to restarting the refrigeration system, the compressor is again run with the refrigerant flow from the condenser to the evaporator closed off to pump refrigerant out of the evapor ator to reduce the refrigerant pressure in the evaporator to a second desired, relatively low level. This dual pump down cycle ensures that no liquid refrigerant from the evaporator will enter the compressor when the refrigeration system is restarted.
