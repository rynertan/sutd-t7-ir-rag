# Optical card.

## Abstract
An optical recording material comprising I a substrate, II a recording layer provided on said substrate, the record ing layer consisting of light transmissive portions and light screening portions, and III a reflective metallic thin film layer provided on the recording layer as well as a process therefor. The invention also includes an optical card compris ing the optical recording material provided on a card substrate. In the cases of the optical recording material and the optical card, it is possible to readily carry out high density recording, the alternation of written information is difficult, and the written information can be read out on a basis of the difference in light reflectivity.
