# Immunohistochemical assay for detection of a tumor associated marker p53 .

## Abstract
This invention is an immunohistochemical p53 assay method in which human tissue sections or cells are fixed on a glass slide and incubated with anti p53 antibodies which react with the p53 antigen in the specimen. The p53 antigen antibody complex is then localized by addition of anit Ig which is either labeled directly or indirectly with an enzyme. Next, a chromogen substrate solution for the enzyme is added to the slide and color is developed. The slide is then examined under a microscope for specifically stained cells which indicate the presence of p53 antigen.

## Description
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL ASSAY FOR DETECTION OF A TUMOR ASSOCIATED RKER PS3 L Field of the Invention The invention relates to a method for detecting a tumor associated marker and more particularly to an immunohistochemical method for this purpose.Background of the Invention A tumor associated marker or antigen designated p53 was initially identified in animal tumors by Lane et al., Nature 278 261 263 1979 De Leo et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. 76 2420 2424 1979 . The p53 molecule is a phosphoprotein having a molecular weight of 53,000 daltons which is usually found in the nucleus of tumor cells. Rotter et al., Int. J. Cancer 31 315 320 1983 , discovered that tumors which are positive for p53 tend to progress, whereas, tumors which are negative for p53 tend to regress. Also, the presence of p53 in the nucleus of cells may be indicative of transformation of normal cells to a tumorigenic state. Crawford et al., Int. J. Cancer 30 403 408 1982 and Benchimol et al., EMBO J. 1 1055 1062 1982 have identified the presence of antibody to p53 in the sera of breast cancer patients using a solid phase radioimmunoassay and an immunoprecipitation assay.Further, Crawford et al. suggest that the presence of p53 antibody in breast cancer sera may be indicative of metastatic disease. The detection of p53 in various tumor cell cultures has been performed using various antibodies specific for this antigen see, for example, Lane et al., Nature 278 261 263 1979 De Leo, et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. 76 2420 2424 1979 . Xonoclonal antibodies have also been prepared to p53 from human and mouse cell cultures see, for example, Thomas et al., Virology 131 502 517 1983 Gurney, et al., J. Virology 34 752 763 1980 . These prior art methods have utilized immunofluorescence for detection of p53 in animal cell lines and immunoprecipitation methods for detection of p53 in human cell lines. However, to our knowledge. p53 has not been localized by immunohistochemical procedures in human tumor specimens or human tumor cell lines.Summary of the Invention We have developed an immunohistochemical p53 assay method which permits not only the detection of p53 antigen in human cells but also in tissue specimens.The improved p53 assay utilizes an immunoenzymatic staining method which is more sensitive and stable than prior art immunofluorescence as says and simpler to perform than immunoprecipitation methods According to the invention, human tissue sections or cells are fixed on a glass slide and incubated with anti p53 antibodies which react with the p53 antigen in the specimen. The p53 antigen antibody complex is then localized by addition of anti Ig which is either labeled directly or indirectly with an enzyme. Next, a chromogen substrate solution for the enzyme is added to the slide and color is developed.The slide is then examined under a microscope for specifically stained cells which indicate the presence of p53 antigen.Detailed Description of the Invention The method for detecting p53 in tumor cells or tissue according to this invention comprises fixing a tissue or cell preparation to be examined on a glass slide, contacting the fixed tissue or cells with antibody to p53, contacting the tissue or cells with anti Ig labeled either directly or indirectly with an enzyme, contacting the tissue or cells with a chromogenic indicator which changes color in the presence of the enzyme and examining the slide for presence of p53. For purposes of this disclosure, anti Ig labeled directly with an enzyme means that an antibody to Ig is conjugated to an enzyme such as by the methods described by Nakane et al., J. Histochem. Cytochem. 22 1084 1091 1974 . The anti Ig enzyme conjugate comprises one reagent. UAnti Ig labeled indirectly with an enzyme means the anti Ig is added to the assay as one reagent, and then a separate Ig enzyme reagent is added which will bind to the anti Ig in the inventive assay. An anti Ig indirectly labeled with an enzyme is described in Example 1 below. The following examples are illustrative of the inventive p53 assay. ExamPle 1 This example illustrates a preferred procedure for conducting the assay method of this invention.1. Treat microscope slides with a positively charged polymer solution such as poly l lysine molecular weight 30,000 70,000 at 100 micrograms per milliliter in distilled water for 5 minutes and then rinse and dry. Other positively charged polymer solutions such as poly l arginine can be used to pretreat the slide.2. Cut a frozen section 6 8 microns of tissue to be tested using a cryostat and transfer to poly l lysine coated slide. Any human cell or tissue preparation can be substituted for the frozen section.3. Immediately fix the frozen tissue section on the slide in a fixative such as Zamboni s fixative at 40C for 10 15 minutes, rinse in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline at pH 7.4 PBS for 5 minutes, place in cold acetone at 200C for 1 minute and finally rinse twice in phosphate buffered saline baths for 5 minutes each. Steps 4 11 below are preferably performed at ambient temperatures of 18 250C. 4. Add 2z or greater normal serum in phosphate buffered saline solution to tissue section and incubate 15 minutes.

In the preferred embodiment, the anti p53 monoclonal antibody is of mouse origin. Rinse twice in phosphate buffered saline baths for 5 minutes each.6. Add anti Ig antibody preferably diluted 1 20 in phosphate buffered saline solution to the tissue section and incubate 30 minutes. In the preferred assay, the anti Ig antibody is species specific for the species of origin for the anti p53 antibody, such as an anti mouse IgG antibody. Rinse twice in phosphate buffered saline baths for 5 minutes each. 7 Add peroxidase, anti peroxidase PAP complex preferably diluted 1 50 in 2 normal serum phosphate buffered saline to the tissue section and incubate 30 minutes. Again, in the preferred assay, the PAP complex is of the same species origin as the anti p53 antibody such as mouse PAP complex. Rinse twice in phosphate buffered saline baths for 5 minutes each.8. Prepare a chromogen substrate solution. Examples of chromogen substrate solutions are well known in the art and include diaminobenzidine, aminoethyl carbozole and 4 chloro alpha naphthol. In the preferred assay, 10 milligrams diaminobenzidine 20 microliters of 30S hydrogen peroxide Âµ 16 milliliters phosphate buffered saline is used as the chromogen solution. Add to tissue section and allow to incubate 6 minutes at ambient temperature. Rinse for 5 minutes in running tap water. 9. Counterstain section in diluted hematoxylin, malachite green or methylene blue. Preferably, Harris hematoxylin 1 10 in distilled water is applied to the section for 10 15 seconds. Rinse for 5 minutes in running tap water.10. Dehydrate section as, for example, by immersing the section twice for 2 minutes in 958 ethanol, twice for 2 minutes in absolute ethanol and twice for 2 minutes in xylene. 11. Examine the slide microscopically at, for example, 25 x 10 magnification power to detect specifically stained cells. ExamPle 2 This example demonstrates the preparation of monoclonal antibody to p53 as described by Gurney et al., J. Virology 34 752 763 1980 .1. Balb c mice are injected with SV40 transformed cells.2. Spleen cells from immunized animals are fused with a murine myeloma, NS1 according to the procedure described by Galfre et al., Nature 266 550 552 1977 , using polyethylene glycol 1000.3. The fused cells are grown in Dulbeccols minimum essential medium containing 20 fetal calf serum, 50 uM hypoxanthine, 5 uM aminopterin, and 10 uM thymidine in a multiwell plate.4. Culture supernatants from the wells showing growth are evaluated for antibodies to the p53 antigen by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay described by Engvall and Perlmann, J. Immunology 109 129 135 1972 .5. Positive cells are cloned in soft agar and expanded in larger culture dishes. The culture supernatants are collected and stored at 20 C. ExamPle 3 The preparation of mouse peroxidase, anti peroxidase complex PAP is based on the procedure of Sternberger et al., J. Histochem. Cytochem.18 315 333 1970 . 1. Mice are injected with horseradish peroxidase HRPO to prepare antisera.2. Mouse anti HRPO serum is incubated with HRPO at room temperature.3. The resulting precipitate is centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 minutes at 40C and washed three times with cold phosphate buffered saline PBS .4. The precipitate is resuspended in a solution of HRPO and then dissolved by adjusting to pH 2.3 using 1N hydrochloric acid.5. The solution is immediately neutralized to pH 7.4 using 1N sodium hydroxide.6. Next, 2.7 ml of 0.08 N sodium acetate and 0.15 N ammonium acetate are added.7. The precipitate is washed once in cold, 50S saturated ammonium sulfate.8. The precipitate is dissolved in distilled water and dialyzed against sodium ammonium acetate saline. 9. The dialyzed solution is centrifuged at 20,000 g for 16 minutes at 40C to remove any remaining precipitate.10. The resulting mouse PAP complex is aliquoted and stored at 20 C. Example 4 This example illustrates a procedure for the conjugation of an enzyme to anti Ig as described by Nakane et al., J. Histochem. Cstochem. 22 1084 1091 1974 .1. The enzyme, horseradish peroxidase HRPO , is activated by treating with sodium periodate in O.1M sodium bicarbonate,.pH 8.0 for 30 35 minutes.2. The excess sodium periodate is removed from the HRPO by column chromatography such as on a Sephadex G 25 column, made by Pharmacia Inc., Piscataway, New Jersey, which has been equilibrated in O.O1M sodium carbonate, pH 9.5.3. The activated HRPO is added to anti Ig and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature.4. The solution is cooled to 40C in an ice bath.5. Sodium borohydride is dissolved in cold 0.ole sodium carbonate, pH 9.5 and added to the anti Ig HRPO conjugate for 12 24 hours at 40C. 6. Acetone is added to the solution to destroy excess sodium borohydride and allowed to stand for 30 minutes at room temperature.7. The anti Ig HRPO conjugate is diluted in a protein stabilizing solution and stored at 200C. There are many advantages to the above described immunohistochemical assay for p53. First, the assay can be performed routinely in most pathology laboratories using standard frozen sections. Previous assays such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation are not routinely performed in clinical laboratories. Second, the assay provides an immunoperoxidase staining technique which utilizes a highly stable reaction product. Therefore, stained specimens can be stored for several years without loss of localization of the p53 antigen. Immunofluorescent stained specimens, on the other hand, must be stored under special conditions in order to preserve localization. Third, the assay is easy to perform without any special instruction, training or equipment. Although this invention has been described with respect to specific modifications, the details thereof are not to be construed as limitations, for it will be apparent that various equivalents, changes and modifications may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, it is understood that such equivalents are intended to be included herein.
