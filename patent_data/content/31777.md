## Description
HIGH VISCOSITY POLYOXYALtYLENE GLYCOL BLOCK COPOLYMERSAND METHOD OF MAKING THE SAMEo This invention relates to water soluble polyether copolymers, and, more particularly, to novel high viscosity, liquid water soluble polyoxyalkylene glycolpolyurethane copolymers suitable for use as functional fluids and to the method of preparing the same. Water soluble poly alkylene oxide polymers have achieved wide scale commercial acceptance as functional fluids for a broad spectrum of applications such as lubricating fluids, hydraulic fluids, metal working lubricants, heat transfer fluids and metal quenching mediam. As functional fluids, the poly alkylene oxide polymers can be used in either their substantially 100 concentrated form, or, most widely, in aqueous compositions thereof where the polymer serves as both lubricant and thickening agent or viscosity builder. Poly alkylene oxide polymers which are most widely used as functional fluids are, in general, copolymers that will contain both oxyethylene groups and higher oxyalkylene groups, such as oxypropylene and oxybutylene groups. The amount of oxyethylene groups in the molecule is such that the polymers are soluble in water at ordinary temperatures and the amount of oxypropylene or higher oxyalkylene groups is such that the polymers remain liquid at ordinary temperatures up to molecular weights of 40,000 and higher. The poly alkylene oxide polymers can be prepared as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent 2,425,845 toToussaint et al., under conditions permitting control over such important parameters as molecular weight, composition, and molecular structure. ihus, for example, by appropriate selection of initiator, epoxide ratio ethylene oxide propylene oxide ratio , and mode of feed mixed, sequential, gradient, etc. poly alkylene oxide polymers can be prepared with generally precise controlled viscosity, solubility, cloud point, surface tension, and the like characteristics which are critical to the performance of a functional fluid. Notwithstanding the versatility and desirability of poly alkylene oxide polymers as a class of functional fluids, the polymers do have some limitations such as being generally more expensive than alternate petroleum derived materials. To offset these economic limitations a combination of superior performance characteristics must be relied on. For example, in water based systems, poly alkylene oxide polymers of high viscosity are required so that lower concentrations of polymer can be employed, Known, conventional poly alkylene oxide polymers, exhibit viscosities which are directly related to their molecular weight.However, molecular weights much greater than 20,000 are difficult to obtain from ethylene oxide propylene oxide copolymers because of undesirable side reactions involving the propylene oxide moiety, and the costs attendant with overcoming the process difficulties of preparing high molecular weight polymers, which includes carrying out the reaction in multiple stages, further increases the costs and economic disadvantages thereof. At the same time, lower molecular weight polymers, which may be prepared in a single stage reaction, are inefficient as thickening agents and must be used at economically, prohibitive concentrations. It would be highly desirable, therefore, to develop water soluble poly alkylene oxide polymers of very high molecular weights and or viscosities that exhibit effective functional fluid characteristics and are highly efficient thickening agents for water based systems. Moreover, the development of such polymers which could be readily and economically prepared would certainly be highly advantageous. Within the past few years other chemical methods have been suggested for preparing high molecular weight poly alkylene oxide polyols such as, for example, disclosed in UOSo Patent 2,990,396 to Clark et al and UOS. Patent 4,113,785 to Helfert et al wherein polyoxyalkylene polyols are reacted with polyepoxides or diepoxy compounds in various ratios to prepare a variety of high molecular weight polymers that may be water insoluble and cross linked or may be water soluble. However, in the case where water soluble polymers are produced, the processes disclosed generally require several reaction steps and the use of molar, as compared to small catalytic quantities, of alkali metal catalysts consequently development of a process which would be even more direct would offer some further technical as well as economic advantages. In accordance with the present invention there is provided high molecular weight, high viscosity, primarily straight chain liquid, water soluble, polyoxyalkylene glycol block copolymers that are suitable for use as functional fluids comprising polyoxyalkylene glycol block copolymers having the general formula EMI3.1 wheres Q is the organic residue from an aliphatic or aromatic diisocyanate including those diisocyanates of the oligomeric or prepolymer types derived from the reaction of an excess of diisocyanate with a short chain diol which contain urethane linkages x is an integer representing the average number of polyurethane blocks in the copolymer and is in the range of 1 to 10 R1 and R2, which can be the same or different, are hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or mixtures thereof with the proviso that the overall content of species wherein R1 and R2 is hydrogen must be at least 50 percent by weight R3 and R4, which can be the same or different, are organic residues resulting from the removal of terminal hydrogen atoms from difunctional polyols and may be alkylene, arylene, alkarylene, aralkylene, cycloalkylene, heterocycloalkylene radicals or mixtures thereof y and z are integers representing the average number of polyether blocks in the copolymer with the proviso that the sum of y and z must be from 1.05 to 2.0 times the value of x and n,m, r, and s, which may be the same or different, are integers wherein n m and r s and the sums of num and r s, which may be the same or different, are each in the range of about 8 to 250. The novel copolymeric compositions of the invention ion are water soluble materials that have utility in a wide spectrum of functional fluid applications, either in concentrated form or in water based systems. Moreover the copolymeric compositions have been found to be highly efficient thickening agents for water based systems, having a significantly higher viscosity than found for conventional poly alkylene oxide polymers of similar molecular weight. In accordance with the invention there is also provided a process for preparing water soluble, high molecular weight poly alkylene oxide block copolymers which are suitable for use as functional fluids which comprises reacting, with vigorous agitationva stoichio metric excess of a polyoxyalkylene diol containing at least 50 percent by weight of oxyethylene groups with an organic diisocyanate wherein the total equivalent of hydroxyl functionality of said diol exceeds the equivalents of isocyanate functionality by a factor in the range of from about 1.05 to 1 to 2.0 to 1 for the time necessary to prepare a hydroxyl terminated copolymer condensation product. The condensation reaction can be carried out at elevated temperatures of from about 4000 to about 1750C with or without a catalyst being present. The polyoxyalkylene glycols suitable for use in preparing the polyoxyalkylene copolymers of the present invention are diols having the formula EMI4.1 wherein R is an organic residue resulting from the removal of term ns1 hydrogen atoms from diols and may be alkylene, arylene, alkarylene, aralkylene, cycloalkylene, heterocycloarylene and the like radicals or mixtures thereof,R1 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or mixtures thereof, and n is an integer in the range of 4 to about 125. The suitable diols are polyoxyalkylene glycols which have a molecular weight from about 600 to about t2,534 and preferably from about 1500 to about 6,000, and contain both oxyethylene groups and higher oxyalkylene groups, such as oxypropylene and oxybutylene groups in the mole coulee The amount of oxyethylene groups in the molecule is such that the polyoxyalkylene glycols are water soluble at ordinary temperatures and the amount of oxypropylene or higher oxyalkylene group is such that the polyoxyalkylene glycols remain liquid at ordinary temperatures. The oxyethylene oxypropylene ratio may vary, but compounds suitable for use in accordance with the practice of the invention should have at least 50 percent by weight of oxyethylene groups, with a ratio of from about 60 40 to about 90 10 being preferred. These polyoxyalkylene glycols are known in the art and are commonly produced by reacting a mixture of ethylene oxide and other alkylene oxides, such as propylene oxide, with a short chain compound having two active hydrogen atoms including, for example, dihydric alcohols, such as ethylene glycol, t,2 propylene glycol, t,3 propylene glycol, butylene glycols, diethylene glycol, diprppylene glycol, triethylene glycol, as well as other such aliphatic dihydroxy compounds aromatic dihydroxy compounds such as bisphenol A cycloaliphatic dihydroxy compounds and the like. The polyoxyalkylene glycols can have a variety of molecular structures such as random, block heteric both random and block structure together , gradient as for example, from a continuously varying programmed feed , and various other combinations. The products of reaction will have generally linear oxyalkylene chains and such chains will terminate with hydroxyl groups. Exemplary suitable polyoxyalkylene glycols are available commercially under the trademark designation UCON fluids and CARBOWAXES from Union Carbide Corporation, and the trademark designations Pluronics from BASF Wyandotte. Diisocyanates suitable for use in preparing the polyoxyalkylene copolymers of the present invention may be any of the knownaromatic or aliphatic diisocyanates provided that these are clearly difunctional, i.e., they should be free of any functionality greater than 2 and essentially free of monofunctional species to avoid crosslinking and chain growth termination reactions.These isocyanates are well know to those skilled in the polyurethane art and illustrative thereof can be mentioned aromatic diisocyanates such as 4,4 methylenebis 4 phenylisocyanate tolylenet c SLateg and phenylene diisocyanate which are preferred because of their high reactivities and low equivalent weights aliphatic diisocyanates ,such as 4,4 methylenebis cyclohexylisocyanate , and trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate and the like, and mixtures of such diisocyanates. Also suitable are oligomeric diisocyanates, known as prepolymers, which result from reacting a short chain glycol with substantial excess of diisocyanate to form a low to moderate molecular weight molecular weight up to about t500 linear urethane prepolymer terminated with NCO groups. The choice of glycols employed in the preparation of urethane prepolymers for use in compositions of the invention should be made so that the polyoxyalkylene copolymer prepared therefrom will be water soluble. In producing the polyoxyalkylene copolymers of the invention a stoichiometric excess of the polyoxyalkylene glycol is reacted with the diisocyanate. The copolymers of the invention must be prepared under conditions wherein the total equivalents of hydroxyl functionality exceeds the total equivalents of isocyanate functionality, TheOH NCO ratio can vary from about 1.05 1.0 and 2.0 1.0, and preferably is in the range from about 1 .15 1.0 and 1.50 1 0. This stoichiometry assures the production of a copolymer terminated with hydroxyl groups which, hence, is unreactive towards water, alcohol, amines, etc. which may be used in formulating functional fluids with the copolymers of the invention. The molecular weights of the polyoxyalkylene block copolymer compositions of the invention that are produced are less than that which may be theoretically calculated but, in general, can be varied by the choice of reactants employed. For example, the use of lower molecular weight, high o mypt rlene content polyo ra32 r1sne glycols provides copolymers more closely approaching their theoretical molecular weights than does the use of high molecular weight polyoxyalkylene glycols of lower oxyethylene content. The viscosities of the polyoxyalkylene copolymers of the invention are governed both by their molecular weight and by their urethane moiety content. With any given combination of reactants, the copolymer viscosity will increase with decreasing OH NCO ratio and at a givenOH NCO ratio, the product viscosity will increase with increasing urethane moiety content. In any case, the copolymers of this invention will exhibit viscosities of from about 2 to about 5 times that of a conventional polyoxyalkylene glycol of comparable molecular weight.This is an important and surprising feature of the compositions of the present invention since the thickening efficiency of the copolymer in water based systems is an important factor in determining the concentration of the polymer that must be used to achieve desired results from a given functional fluid formulation. The polyoxyalkylene block copolymers of the invention can be produced by reacting one or more polyoxyalkylene glycols with one or more diisocyanates in stoichiometric proportions wherein, as hereinabove discribed, the total equivalents of hydroxyl functionality of the polyoxyalkylene glycol reactant exceeds the total equivalents of isocyanate functionality of the diisocyanate reactant by a factor of from about 1.05 1 to 2.0 1. To be suitable for use in preparing the block copolymer compositions of the invention, the polyoxyalkylene glycols must be free from residual basic catalyst used in their preparation. If the residual catalyst is not removed, the ensuing condensation reaction with a diisocyanate will lead to the formation of gels. The poly oxYalkylene glycol may be neutralized by any suitable method known in the art such as by ion exchange techniques or treating the glycol under heat with a solid magnesium silicate.For example, in the ion exchange procedure, an aqueous alcoholic solution of the basic catalyst containing polyglycol is first passed through a bed of an acidic H form ion exchange resin and the effluent it then stripped of water and alcohol diluent alternate procedure, the base containing polyglycol is first heated with magnesium silicate neutralizer for one to several hours at 500O to t000C and then recovered by filtration to remove the solid neutralizer. Regardless of the neutralizing procedure used, the hydroxyl number molecular weight of the neutralized polyoxyalkylene glycol should be determined so that the amount of diisocyanate reactant to be used in the condensation reaction can be established. Another important factor that must be taken into account concerning the polyoxyalkylene glycol reactant to be used in accordance with the practice of the invention is the water content thereof. The glycol reactant should be essentially free of water, that is, it should contain less than 0. , and preferably, 0.02 or less of water.The polyglycol may be treated by vacuum stripping or azeotropic distillation to remove undesirable amounts of water. A low water content in the glycol reactant is required because water is reactive with isocyanates and the presence thereof in any significant quantity will upset the OH NCO stoichiometry of the ensuing condensation reaction. As pointed out hereinabove, in polyoxyalkylene glycols suitable for use in preparing polyoxyalkylene glycol block copolymers of the invention at least 50 percent by weight of the oxyalkylene groups in the chain must be oxyethylene groups, and preferably, should be from about 65 to 85 percent by weight of the total weight, Suitable diisocyanates as hereinabove described for use in preparing the polyoxyalkylene glycol block copolymers of the invention may be any aromatic or aliphatic difunctional diisocyanates having a molecular weight of up to about t500 or mixtures thereof. Regardless of the type or types of diisocyanate used, the equivalent weight or free NCO content must be determined before using it as a reactant in the condensation reaction of the invention The condensation is preferably carried out in bulk without the use of solvents or diluents, though if desired, a solvent can be used which is nonreactive and inert to the reactants. In a preferred embodiment, the polyoxyalkylene glycol reactant , and catalyst, if one is desired, are charged to a heated reactor and the diisocyanate reactant is fed to the heated reactor. The time of addition is not critical and is generally chosen so that the exotherm does not exceed the cooling capabilities of the reactor.It is desirable to blanket the reaction charge with an inert gas such as nitrogen to prevent color buildup due to oxidation After completion of the condensation reaction, the high viscosity products formed are preferably removed from the reactor while still hot in order to facilitate the material transfer.Alternatively, a preferred procedure may involve converting the bulk reaction product directly to an aqueous concentrate, e.g. a 50 aqueous solution, by adding the required amount of water directly into the reaction product after completion of the condensation reaction and using the reactor agitator to form a solution at a temperature of 5000 to 10000Q Efficient agitation of the reaction mixture is an important factor in the process because of the high viscosity of the reaction product, and suitable agitation means must be provided. The temperature at which the condensation reaction can be carried out is not narrowly critical but will generally range from about 4000 to about 17500, and preferably, from about 500C to about 12500. The pressure used is, also, not critical and may be varied widely, though atmospheric pressure is generally preferred. The condensation reaction can be affected with or without a catalyst being present, but generally, it is preferred that a catalyst is employed. From about 0001 percent to about 001 percent, based on the weight of polyoxyalkylene glycol, of a catalyst typically employed in the preferation of polyurethanes, such as DISCO, stannous octoate, dibutyltin dilaurate, and the like, can be advantageously employed. When carried out in the presence of a catalyst, the reaction proceeds rapidly and as little as 10 minutes may be satisfactory through about 1 hc is generally preferred. The invention is further described in the Examples which follow. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLE I A quantity of a diethylene glycol started ethylene oxide propylene oxide 75 25 by weight polyoxyalkylene glycol having a nominal viscosity of 5000 SUS approx lO i4x1O 4 m2 s and a molecular weight of 4000 5000 was neutralized by heating for one hour at 1000C with 2 percent by weight of magnesium silicate purchased under the trademark designation Magnesol. The polyglycol was then filtered and vacuum stripped. The neutralized polyglycol was analyzed and determined to have a molecular weight of 4924, a water content of 0.04 percent, a viscosity of 9.76 x 10 4 m2 s at 37.80C and no alkalinity. A 1 liter glass resin kettle fitted with an agitator 4 bladed, pitched blade types operated at 300 rpm , temperature recording thermocouple, feed tank, and an inert gas inlet tube was used in carrying out the condensation reaction experiments of this Example. A series of four reaction experiments were run using the proportion of reactants summarized in Table I and the following procedures The neutralized polyoxyalkylene glycol and the catalyst were charged to the reaction vessel and a nitrogen blanket was then fed into the reactor. The reactants were heated to 550C 600C with agitation. Molten 4,4 methylenebis phenylisocyanate MDI was then fed into the reactant charge through the feed tank, using a total feed time of about TO minutes. The temperature was allowed to rise as the reaction exothermed and the charge built viscosity. Following addition of all the MDI, the temperature was increased to about 1000C and maintained there for about one hour. The viscous copolymer was then discharged from the reactor while hot and then analyzed0The charaterization data determined for each of the reaction products prepared in this Example are also summarized in Table I, below, TABLE I Reactants EXPERIMENTAL REACTION Charge grams A B C D Polyglycol 492.4 300.36 300.36 300.36 Catalyst 0 246 0.15 0.15 0.15 MDI 17.91 10.56 10.16 9.62 OH NCO RatioOverall Basis Isocyanate Moiety. 3.51 3.40 3.27 3.10 wt. of reactants 3.51 3.40 3.27 3.10 Product Molecular Weight By OH Number 13,256 12,174 11.648 9,906By GPC 12,460 13,210 13,300 11,380 Gel Permeation Chromatography Actual Degree of Polymerization From OH Number Molecular Weight Product Viscosity m s at 37.8 C Bulk Fluid 373x10 4 1,008x10 4 771x10 4 489x10 4 50 Aqueous Sol n l7.4xlO 4 13.55x1O 4 11 .23xIO 4 8.10x10 4 Product Cloud Point, C 50 Aqueous Sol n 83 83 84 84 1 Aqueous Sol n 58 60 61 62 The OH number and Gel Permeation Chromatography are standard techniques for determining the molecular weight of polymers It is apparent that high molecular weight, water soluble polymers were prepared which exhibit extremely high viscosities. SXAMPIE 2 Using the procedure and apparatus of Example 1, a series of 5 reaction experiments were run to study the relationship of isocyanate moiety content of the copolymer prepared and viscosity. The proportions of reactants are summarized in Table II. In this Example a diethylene glycol started ethylene osidelpropylene oxide 75 25 by weight having a nominal viscosity of 5000 SUS at 37.80C 10 14 x 10 4m2 s and a molecular weight of 4000 5000 was used after neutralizing by the technique of Example 1.

It is apparent from the data that high molecular weight, high viscosity, water soluble copolymers are prepared in each of the reaction experiments of the Example.It is also shown that increasing the isocyanate moiety content of the copolymer results in a product that exhibits a higher viscosity.

The reaction mixture is periodically examined by Infra Red Spectroscopy to monitor the presence of unreacted NCO functionality which absorbs at 4.42fin the Infra Red. When such instrumental analysis shows no NCO functionality to be present, a wet chemical analysis for NCO, using the standard method employing reaction with excess di nbutylamine followed by back titration of excess amine with hydrochloric acid, is run to confirm completion of the reaction. The reaction product is discharged while hot and a high viscosity, water soluble fluid copolymer is obtained.
