## Description
REDISTRIBUTION OF ORGANOHALOSILANES UTILIZING LEWIS ACID ACTIVATED ZEOLITE CATALYSTSTECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a method for the redistribution of organohalosilanes utilizingLewis acid activated zeolite catalysts. More particularly, this invention relates to the production of trimethylchlorosilane by the redistribution of mixtures of other sethylchlorosilanes. BACKGROUND ART The preparation of methylchlorosilanes by direct synthesis Rochow Synthesis, See U.S. A 2,380,995 , results in the unavoidable formation of a considerable proportion of low boiling products with a boiling point of less than IOOC 760mmHg. . Said low boiling products include for example.tetramethylsilane. dimethylchlorosilane, methyldichlorosilane. ethylchlorosilane, trichiorosilane. methyichloride. hydrocarbons, etc.A method of converting the above mentioned low boiling product mixture into compounds especially trimethylchlorosilane more useful in silicones industry is needed. Many redistribution and alkylation methods are known in the art for the preparation of organohalosilanes from other silanes utilizing aluminum catalysts and reactants. and other materials. Thus, the preparation of organohalosilanes from other silanes has been achieved using a wide variety of catalysts.co catalysts and reactants such as silica alumina. zeolites. methyl chloride. metallic aluminum.hydrogen chloride. aluminum trichloride.methylaluminum halides. etc. Generally. of theLewis acid activated catalysts. aluminum trichloride was the most widely used for these types of reactions. The utilization of aluminum trichloride and organoaluminum compounds as reagents and or catalysts in these processes, however. was fraught with numerous difficulties. A redistribution reaction is a rearrangement of at least two different substituents which are attached to a silicon atom or atoms. Two or more silanes having differing numbers of substituents such as CH3 or C1, for example.redistribute when said substituents exchange silicon sites. The resulting product or products still have a total of four substituents or atoms attached to the silicon atom, but in ratios different from that of the starting compounds. A typical redistribution reaction can be illustrated by the following EMI2.1 A disproportionation reaction is a type of redistribution reaction that occurs when a single silicon compound yields two or more dissimilar silicon compounds having substituents i.e. CH3 and C1 in differing proportions from that of the initial starting compound.A disproportionation reaction can be illustrated by the following EMI2.2 The use of organoaluminum compounds in general results in pyrophoric, potentially explosive. and readily hydrolyzable organoaluminum by products which must be disposed of via lixiviation with water or alkali. This can be extremely hazardous because of the attendant hydrolysis of methylchlorosilanes to yield hydrogen chloride. Aluminum trichloride has appreciable solubility in methylchlorosilane mixtures which can produce separation and purification problems.Plugging problems in transport lines and distillation columns are usually concomitant with its use. Additionally. the use of aluminum trichloride involves long contact times ranging anywhere fros two to twenty four hours. U.S. A 2,647.136. U.S. A 2.786.861 and U.S. A 3.793.357 all employ the use of an aluminum trichloride catalyst in the preparation of an alkylhalosilane by redistribution. The latter two patents also employ the use of an SiR compound as the promoter or co catalyst thus permitting the use of lower reaction temperatures. All of these patents. however0 disclose processes operated under autogenous pressure and at temperatures between 1500 400 C for periods of two to twenty four hours.Other patents which utilize an aluminum trichloride catalyst with or without a co catalyst include U.S. A 2,730,540, U.S. A 3,655,710 and U.S. A 3.980.686. It should be noted, however, that not all Lewis acid catalysts such as boron trichloride, zinc chloride, iron chloride. copper chloride, etc. exert a perceptible effect on the course of these reactions. U.S. A 2.647,136. Column 3, Lines 69 75 . Japanese Patent 3026 1964 discloses the preparation of phenylmethyldichlorosilane from phenyltrichlorosilane and tetramethylsilane utilizing an activated alumina catalyst at 2400C for 10 hours in an autoclave. Japanese Patent 1822 1957 discloses the preparation of methyltrichlorosilane from trimethylchlorosilane and silicon tetrachloride utilizing an activated alumina catalyst at 2800C for 4 hours. Contrastingly,Japanese Patent 23.172 1961 shows that CH3SiHC12 is obtained by heating CH3 3SiCl and Sic13 in the presence of alumina at 2000 4000C under autogenous conditions for up to 10 hours.Though all these patents disclose the use of activated alumina catalysts, the reactions involved require significantly longer reaction times contact time typically, of four hours or longer. The use of methylaluminum sesquichloride to methylate methyl trichlorosilane is disclosed inU.S. A 3.065.253. Here SiH compounds. e.g.methyldichlorosilane, is advantageously used to shorten the reaction time from 20 hours to 2 hours. U.S. A 4,155,927 discloses a process for preparing trimethylchlorosilane by reacting methyldichlorosilane with methyl chloride and metallic aluminum. Methylchloride reacts with aluminum to form methylaluminum sesquichloride. The organoaluminum compound methylaluminum sesquichloride is the methylating agent which reacts with methyldichlorosilane to form aluminum trichloride and trimethylchlorosilane. This reaction is a methylation reaction not a redistribution reaction. This process is not catalytic. Furthermore, the production of AlCl3 results in hazardous waste disposal problems as previously mentioned. U.S. A 4,297,500 discloses a process for synthesizing trimethylchlorosilane from the low boiling C40 C fraction of the Rochow direct synthesis U.S. A 2.380,995 by hydrochlorination of this fraction in the presence of catalytic amounts of All3. The amount of HC1 employed must be at least equal to the molar amount of tetramethylsilane in the low boiling fraction. AlCl3 is disclosed in this patent as a catalyst for the hydrochlorination reaction rather than redistribution. U.S. A 4,158,010 discloses an improved redistribution process for preparing organosilanes by reacting a mixture of alkylbalosilanes with silanes containing an Si H bond in the presence of organoaluminum compounds and hydrogen halides. The various forms or organoaluminum compounds utilized include ethylaluminum dichloride, trimethylaluminum, methylaluminum sesquichloride, etc. This patent teaches see Example 4 the synthesis of trimethylchlorosilane from the low boiling fraction of the Rochow direct synthesis and added methyltrichlorosilane by heating the reaction mixture at reflux for 6 hours in the presence of methylaluminum sequichloride and hydrogen chloride. In effect, this method combines hydrochlorination and methylation with redistribution at long contact times. The process of U.S. A 3,065,253 4,155,927 4,297,500 and 4.158,010 are all hampered by the hazardous handling and disposal problems associated with the use of Alcl organoaluminum halides and gaseous HC1. U.S. A 3,384.652 discloses a method for the production of chlorosilanes and organic substituted chlorosilanes by disproportionation and condensation reactions of mixtures of organochlorosilanes in the presence of crystalline aluminosilicate catalysts zeolites . These waluminosilicate materials may also be converted to the H or acid form in which hydrogen ions occupy the cation ion sites Column 4, Lines 41 43 . In general. the H form is more stable in materials having SiO2 Al 203 of 3.5 or higher Column 4,Lines 45 47 . Thus method utilizes zeolites havingBronsted acid sites. Moreover, as in the case of previous processes, this reaction requires long contact times. U. S. A 3.207,699 relates primarily to the preparation of catalysts by chemically attaching a restricted quantity of alkylsilyl groups to the internal surface of an acidic refactory oxide of one or more metals e.g., silica alumina at an elevated temperature. cooling the treated acidic refractory oxide in an atmosphere containing no oxygen, whereby the catalytic properties of the acidic cracking catalyst are significantly modified without completely destroying the acidity of the catalyst.Prior to attaching the alkysilyl groups, the refractory oxide is dried at elevated temperatures in order to prevent the reaction of the silane with water because the latter reaction interferes with the desired reaction of the silane with the refractory oxide. This patent discloses that the refractory oxide contains signficant cracking activity both before and after treatment with the silage. The treated catalysts so produced are disclosed as being useful as redistribution specifically, disproportionation catalysts for trimethylsilane. U.S. A 3,346,349 relates primarily to the use of treated aluminaceous catalysts, including those of U.S. A 3,207,699, as redistribution specifically, disproportionation catalysts for various silanes.In U.S. A 3.346,349 both the class of silanes that can be used to treat the catalysts and the class of silanes that can be redistributed by the treated catalysts are expanded beyond the disclosure of U.S. A 3,207,699. U.S. A 3,346.349 contains a disclosure similar to the disclosure of U.S. A 3,207,699 with respect to the drying of the untreated catalyst and to the method of treatment of the dried catalyst with the silane. U.S. A 3,346.349 makes no reference to the cracking activity either of the untreated catalyst or of the treated catalyst. However. in view of the similar treating conditions, it would appear that the treated catalysts of both patents should have similar properties. As is shown in K.Tanabe, SolidAcids and Bases, Academic Press, N.Y. 1970, pp. 123 133. cracking activity in silica alumina catalysts is associated with the presence ofBronsted acid sites on the catalyst. Hence, accepting the teachings of U.S. A 3,207.699 and 3,346,349 at face value. it appears they relate to redistribution catalysts withBronsted acid sites rather than Lewis acid sites.However, it is possible that the Si lanes reacted with all the Bronsted acid sites on the surface of the silica and alumina in the treatment process of these patents and so the catalysts actually become non acidic during treatment. In view of the high redistribution temperatures actually used in theExamples e.g., 510eC , the redistribution reactions reported in these patents may simply have been thermally induced redistribution reactions as distinguished from catalytically induced redistribution reactions.The possible lack of catalytic activity of the treated oxides of these references despite the disclosure in U.S. A 3,207,699 that the treated catalysts retain significant cracking activity is also consistent with the fact that the Examples of the patents make no reference to any cracking reaction after the initial treatment with silane. Japanese Patent 23.172 1961, however, illustrates that methyldichlorosilane is obtained by heating trimethylchlorosilane and trichlorosilane in the presence of an alumina catalyst at 200 4000C and under autogenous conditions for up to 10 hours.Longer residence times and or higher temperatures promote the formation of silane, a known pyrophoric compound. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for the redistribution and or disproportionation of mixtures of organohalosilanes utilizing a Lewis acid activated zeolite catalyst. More specifically, it is an object of the present invention to prepare trimethylchlorosilanes from mixtures of other methylchlorosilanes, especially those derived from the lower boiling fraction of the Rochow synthesis utilizing aLewis acid activated zeolite catalyst. It is an object of the present invention to effect such redistribution and or disproportionation reaction without the use of aluminum trichloride or other organoaluminum compounds. It is an object of the present invention to effect such redistribution and or disproportionation reaction utilizing short contact times. It is a further objective of the present invention to effect regeneration and reuse of saidLewis acid activated zeolite catalyst.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This and other objects of the invention which will be apparent. to those skilled in the art are achieved by the present invention which relates to a method for redistributing the halogen atom of a halosilane and at least one member selected from the group consisting of the hydrocarbyl group of a hydrocarbylsilane and the hydrogen atom of a hydrosilane which method comprises contacting a mixture of the halosilane, hydrocarbylsilane and or the hydrosilane, with a Lewis acid activated zeolite catalyst said zeolite having an average pore size of greater than about 0.6 nm a SiO2 to Al 203 ratio of less than 8, a pyridine infrared adsorption band at 1451cm 1, and substantially no infrared adsorption band at 1545cm at a time and at a temperature sufficient to effect said redistribution. In a preferred embodiment, this invention relates to a method of catalytically redistributing a mixture of compounds having the formulas RnSiX4 n, and RmSiHX3 m wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. or an phenyl group, X is a halogen.n 4. and m 3, which method comprises contacting the mixture of compounds with a Lewis acid activated zeolite catalyst, said zeolite having an average pore size of greater than about 0.6 nm , a SiO2 to Al 203 ratio of less than 8, a pyridine infrared adsorption band of 1451cm , and with substantially no infrared adsorption band at 1545cm , at a time and at a temperature sufficient to effect said redistribution. Another preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to a method of catalytically redistributing the halogen, the hydrogen. the alkyl groups and or the aryl groups of a single silane represented by the formula RnSiX4 n wherein R is hydrogen, an phenyl group. or an alkyl group containing from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. X is a halogen, and n has a value from 1 to 3, which method comprises contacting the silane in the presence of a Lewis acid activated zeolite catalyst, said zeolite having an average pore size of greater than about 0.6 nm. a SiO2 to Al 203 ratio of less than 8, a pyridine infrared adsorption band at 1451cm . and with substantially no infrared adsorption band at 1545c 1, at a time and at a temperature sufficient to effect said redistribution.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING The sole figure is a schematic drawing depicting apparatus suitable for use in carrying out the redistribution reaction of the present invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING The embodiments of the present invention are best understood by referring to Figure 1. The silane reactants are stored in the vessel 1 and passed through the sintered stainless steel filter 2 to the calibrated pump 3. Liquid from the pump is flash evaporated at 300 C 400eC in the vaporizer 4.The inlet pressure is recorded by the pressure indicator 5. The vaporized reactants are admitted to the reactor 6 that is made from Hastelloy B pipe reactor or Black steel reactor which is equipped with reducing fittings for reactant introduction and product outlet and which contains a zeolite catalyst bed. Quartz wool is placed at both ends of the pipe to keep the zeolite catalyst bed in place in the heated zone. The reactor is heated in a tube furnace 7. At the reactor outlet the gaseous silane product mixture is led to a condenser 8 and cooled by a suitable refrigerant, i.e., dry ice isopropanol. The liquid silane product collected in the receiver 9 is subsequently analyzed and distilled. The practice of this invention is not in any way limited to the apparatus depicted herein.The valves and other minor fittings which would be obvious to those skilled in the art have been omitted. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a method of redistributing halogen atom of a halosilane and at least one member selected from the group consisting of the hydrocarbyl group of a hydrocarbylsilane and the hydrogen atom of a hydrosilane which method comprises contacting a mixture of the halosilane.hydrocarbylsilane and or the hydrosilane, with aLewis acid activated zeolite catalyst said zeolite having an average pore size of greater than about 6Angstroms, a 5i02 to Al2O3 ratio of less than 8, a pyridine infrared adsorption band at 1451cm 1, and with a substantially no infrared adsorption band at 1545cm 1, at a time and at a temperature sufficient to effect said redistribution. A halosilane is defined as any silane containing a halogen atom directly bonded to the silicon atom. A hydrocarbylsilane is defined as any silane containing an alkyl group having from one to five carbon atoms or any phenyl group which is directly bonded to the silicon atom. A hydrosilane is defined as any silane contaning a hydrogen atom which is directly bonded to the silicon atom. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention is a method of catalytically redistributing a mixture of compounds having the formulas RnsiX4 n and RmSHX 3 m wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, or an phenyl group, X is a halogen, n 4, and m 3. which method comprises contacting the mixture of compounds in the presence of a Lewis acid activated zeolite catalyst. said zeolite having an average pore size of greater than about 0.6 nm , a SiO2 to Al 203 ratio of less than 8, a pyridine infrared adsorption band at 1451cm 1. and with substantially no infrared adsorption band at 545cm 1. at a time and at a temperature sufficient to effect said redistribution. Another preferred embodiment of the present invention is a method of catalytically redistributing the halogen, the hydrogen, the alkyl groups and or the aryl groups of a single silane represented by the formula RnSiX4 n wherein R is hydrogen. an phenyl group, or an alkyl group containing from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. X is a halogen, and n has a value from 1 to 3.which method comprises contacting the silane in the presence of a Lewis acid activated zeolite catalyst.said zeolite having an average pore size of greater than about 0.6 nm , a SiO2 to A1203 ratio of less than 8, a pyridine infrared adsorption band at 1451cm 1 and which substantially no infrared adsorption band at 1545cm 1, at a time and at a temperature sufficient to effect said redistribution. Illustrative of the compounds represented by RnSiX4 n are the following CH3SiCl3 C3H7 SiCl3 CH3 2SiCl2 C4H9 2SiCl2 C H SiCl ArSiC13 25 3 C2H5 2SiCl2 Ar2SiBr2 C2H5 3 Ar3SiCl CH3 4Si C6H5 4Si C2H5 4Si C3H7 4Si Illustrative of the compounds represented by RmSiHX3 m are the following CH3 35iH C3H7 2SiHCl CH3 2SiRBr ArSiHBr2 CR 3SiRCl2 Ar2SiHB4 C2HS 2SiCHl The term zeolitic Lewis acid catalyst s is employed herein to denominate the zeolites generally employable herein for the redistribution of organohalosilanes. The zeolitic Lewis acid catalyst s employed in the instant invention is characterized as having an effective amount of Lewis acidity and low Bronsted acidity, i.e., a low proportion of hydroxyl sites.A Bronsted acid is a proton donor H . A Lewis acid is an electron pair acceptor electron deficiency . The Lewis acidity of small pore zeolites average pore size less than about 6 Angstroms and large pore zeolites greater than about 6 Angstroms can be characterized by reference to the dehydroxylation of such zeolites upon calcination.Such calcined zeolites will generally have a Lewis acidity substantially the same as zeolites capable of characterization with pyridine. The actual selection of the calcination temperature employed to form a zeolite with substantial Lewis acidity will be dependent upon the thermal stability of the particular zeolite. In general. zeolites of higher silica to alumina SiO2 Al2O3 ratios are more thermally stable. See Breck, Zeolite MolecularSieves, Ch. 6, John Wiley and Sons, N.Y. 1974 ACSSymposium Series, 171, pg. 286 291, 1976 . However, total Lewis acidity is increased at lowerSiO2 Al2O3 values. Bulletin of the ChemicalSociety of Japan. Vol. 47. pg 801 805. 1974 .Consequently, zeolites employable herein. will be calcined at temperatures and times chosen to preserve the characteristic crystalline structure of the zeolites. These temperatures and times are also correlated to provide an effective amount of Lewis acidity necessary to effect the silane redistribution. For the zeolites of this invention, calcination temperatures are from 400 C 800 C for an effective time of between 1 and 6 hours. The preferred temperature is 6000C 7000C for 5 hours. The Lewis acid acidity of such zeolites may be related to cations associated with the zeolite such that zeolites which are in the hydrogen or ammonium form are more readily converted to zeoliticLewis acid catalysts upon calcination. The acidity of zeolitic Lewis acid catalyst generally in the calcined form having an average pore size greater than about .6 nm can be characterized by the infrared spectrum of adsorbed pyridine wherein such preferred zeoliticLewis acid catalysts are characterized by an infrared band at about 1451cm 1 with substantially no infrared band at 1545cm 1. A procedure for measurement of the Lewis acidity of zeolites using the infrared pattern of pyridine is discussed inUThe Nature of Active Sites on Zeolites X. TheAcidity and Cat.alytic Activity of Zeolites Journal of Catalysis. 14, 365 378 1969 . Zeolites having the required Lewis acid acidity in either their synthesized or in a modified. e.g., ion exchanged and or calcined form. can include both natural and synthetic zeolites.Representative of zeolites employable herein which may have their Lewis acidity characterized by the infrared spectrum of adsorbed pyridine include mordenite sodium and hydrogen forms . offretite, omega. ferrierite. zeolite X, zeolite Y and zeolite L. Pyridine. however, is not an acceptable absorbate for small pore zeolites, i.e.. having average pore sizes less than about 6A.Therefore. such small pore zeolites can be characterized by reference to the dehydroxylation of such small pore zeolites as previously mentioned, Zeolites which are generally employable in the instant process when characterized by the aforementioned Lewis acidity include zeolite X, zeolite Y, zeolite A, zeolite B, zeolite E. zeoliteF, zeolite G. zeolite H, zeolite J. zeolite K G, zeolite L. zeolite P L, zeolite M. zeolite KM, zeolite P. zeolite R, zeolite S. zeolite T. zeoliteU. zeolite Z. ZK 4. ZK 5. ZSM type zeolites. NU type zeolites. FU type zeolites. faujasite, analcite, paulingite, ptilolite, clinoptilolite. ferrierite. chabazite, gmelinite, levgnite, erionite, mordenite.offretite and omega. with the preferred zeoliticLewis acid catalysts being selected from the group consisting of zeolite X. zeolite Y, zeolite L, mordenite. and mixtures thereof. The zeolites of the present invention are further characterized by a sio2 to Al 203 ratio of less than 8 and more preferably less than 6. The zeolite catalysts of the instant invention must be specifically activated to generate Lewis acid sites. The activation and regeneration procedure of the instant invention differs significantly from that disclosed in U.S. A 3,346,349 and 3.207.699 previously discussed. The activation and regeneration procedures of these patents actually destroy the acidity of the silica alumina catalyst. In order to generate Lewis acidity the zeolite catalysts to be used in the present invention are first calcined at temperatures of OOO C to 800 C for periods of 1 12 hrs. Activation of the zeolite can be performed in a separate reactor. such as a Hastelloy reactor Fig. 1 or a steel reactor or in situ in the same reactor used for the redistribution reaction. The latter mode is preferred because any transfer of the activated catalyst carries the risk of surface re hydration.The spent catalyst can also be regenerated in situ.During activation and regeneration a dry. inert gas such as air, nitrogen. argon or helium, flows through the catalyst bed as the temperature is raised to the desired setting. The flow is maintained once this temperature has been reached as well as during the cooling stage. Periods as short as 1 hour may be used for activation. The flow rate of the dry. inert gas can cover a broad range. i.e.0.5 50 lit minute. At the lower limit of this range. it is only necessary to allow the volatile materials released from the hydrated alumina to be swept away. At the upper limit of this range. the maximum gas flow keeps the catalyst contained in the reactor. The activated zeolite catalyst may be used as a fine power. as granules or as pellets. The larger particle size facilitates the flow of gaseous reactants and products through the fixed catalyst bed. The extruded pellets may contain any of the common binders, e.g. clay, silica, alumina, etc. Once the zeolitic Lewis acid catalyst s of the present invention is activated. the mixtures of organohalosilanes are passed through the catalyst bed at temperatures of 2000C 1500C. preferably 300 C 3500C for a maximum contact time reaction time of less than ten minutes, preferably less than two minutes. in order to achieve the same degree of redistribution or better than that achieved by the prior art.

A 3.384.642. 7 zeolites Table 1 spanning a broad range of silica alumina molar ratios and pore sizes were activated at 1000C in vacuo for 7 h and cooled in a desiccator containing Drierite prior to use. In this experiment 107 gm about 100 ml of dimethyldichlorosilane D and 20 gm zeolite were heated together in a 3 neck 250 ml round bottom flask at reflux 700C for 6 h . The flask was fitted with a reflux condenser, heating mantle, magnetic stirrer, thermometer and serum cap. through which a syringe was inserted to withdraw samples for analysis by gas chromatography. The outlet from the reflux condenser was connected to a nitrogen vent line via a drying tube packed with Drierite. At the end of the reaction time, the stirrer was turned off and a sample of the liquid was taken for gas chromatography analysis.The disproportionation products, trimethylchlorosilane M and methyltrichlorosilane T , were not detectedDimethyldichlorosilane D was the only methylchlorosilane detected. Small quantities of oligomeric dimethylsiloxanes and oligomeric methylchlorosiloxanes were also observed. They were formed by hydrolysis of the dimethyldichlorosilane D . The results of these experiments showed thatExample 2 of U.S. A 3,384,642 was not reproducible as described.

Samples 4.0 g of these zeolites see Table 2 were heated separately with 27 gm about 25 ml portions of dimethyldichlorosilane in the apparatus described inExample 1. The liquid was analyzed by gas chromatography after a reflux 70 C time of 6 hrs.Even after Lewis acid activation, which was not disclosed by U.S. A 3,384,652 the unreacted starting material was the only methylchlorosilane present. Table 2 Zeolites Activated for Lewis Acidity Zeolite 5i02 A1203 Zeolite 3 12.1 Zeolite 1 6.2 Zeolite 5 36.2 EXAMPLE 3 The promoting effect of Si H compounds on the disproportionation of dimethyldichlorosilane is well known in the prior art. Therefore. in an effort to successfully carry out the experiment outlined in Example 2 ofU.S. A 3.384,652, we added compounds containingSi H bonds in order to determine if methyldichlorosilane which contain Si H bonds would have an effect on the ability of Lewis acid activated aluminosilicates zeolites to disproportionate dimethyldichlorosilane. Samples of the zeolites 1, 3 and 5 described in Example 2 were used and the reactions were done in the apparatus previously described Example 1 . In each of the three experiments utilizing zeolites 1, 3 and 5. respectively, 2.2 g 0.02 mole CH3SiHC12 MD was added to 26.7 g 0.21 mole CH3 25iC12 D and heated under reflux 700C for 6 h . Gas chromatographic analysis showed only the starting materials. No other methylchlorosilanes were present. EXAMPLE 4 This example was performed to determine if the reactions previously performed in Examples 1. 2 and 3 would proceed at approximately room temperature. The method followed was as illustrated in Example 1. 45.0 g of Zeolite 1 was activated forLewis acidity at 7000C for 5 h and cooled in a dried air stream. This catalyst. in the form of mm mm claybound extrudate. was placed in a 500 ml 4 neck round bottom flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer. reflux condenser and thermometer. The condenser was attached to a nitrogen vent via a drying tube packed with Drierite. The entire apparatus was dried and flushed with nitrogen before 100gm of a mixture of methylchlorosilanes was added. The mixture of methylchlorosilanes added had the composition shown in the first line of Table 3. On addition of the mixture of methylchlorosilanes, the temperature rose from 230C to 500C and a gas was evolved. Stirring was continued for 4 h at 300 400C approximately room temperature and samples were withdrawn periodically for gas chromatographic analysis. The temperature was maintained at room temperature to minimize loss of volatiles. It is clear from the data Table 3 that the Lewis acid activated zeolite caused the disproportionation of CH3 25iHCl DM to CH3 3SiCl M and CH3 2SiCl2 D .However. no disproportionation of CH3 2SiC12 D occurred even in the presence of 3.4 wt HSiCl3 TC and 5.3 wt CH3HSiC12 MD .

The maximum temperatures attained are shown inTable 4. After cooling approximately 12 h in the autoclave. the gas in the head space was vented and the liquid products were retrieved for analysis. In each case, the liquid was clear and colorless. but the solids had changed from white to black. Gas chromatographic and mass spectrometric analyses showed that both CH3SiC13 and CH3 35iCl had been formed along with the cyclic dimethylsiloxanes. D3, D4. and D5 and methylchlorosiloxanes. Also identified were butane.ethylmethyldichlorosilane and tetramethyldichlorodisilane. The latter products and the black color of the recovered zeolite are good evidence of CH3 2SiC12 pyrolysis over the zeolites. The siloxanes were probably formed by hydrolysis during product transfer and sampling.The data of Examples 1 5 show that CH3 2SiCl2 methyldichlorosilane disproportionation occurred over Lewis acid activated zeolites only under autogenous pressure at approximately 2900C. EXAMPLE 6 57.0 g 1,6 mm alumina binded Zeolite 1 was activated by heating to 7000C for 5 h , while maintaining a flow of dried air. 33 1. imin. through the zeolite catalyst bed. The activation and reaction were performed in a reactor. 45.7 cm x 2.0 cm, made of black steel. A methylchlorosilane mixture having the composition shown in the first row of Table 5 was made by blending dimethyldichlorosilane with the forecut lower boiling fraction from the distillation of the crude product obtained from the Rochow Synthesis. The mixture was vaporized at 3000C and contacted with the Lewis acid activated zeolite at 3000C in the reactor system described in Figure 1. Pumping speed liquid flow rate. ml min was varied to obtain a range of contact times.Product samples were taken for gas chromatographic analysis after the liquid feed flow had stabilized at the flowrates shown in the table. The gas flow rates shown are calculated from the composition of the feed assuming ideal gas 3 behavior. A catalyst bed volume of 55.3 cm was used to calculate the superficial contact times shown. The data show that the product contained between 18 28 CH3 3SiCl M depending on the contact time. The catalyst performance was approximately constant for contact times in the range. 9 43 s.

The method of Example 6 was repeated with the same catalyst bed Zeolite 1 . The composition of the methylchlorosilane mixture is shown in the first row of Table 6.The temperature of the catalyst bed was changed to 420 C and the vaporizer for the liquid feed was held at 3600C 37O0C. Table 6 shows that the CH3 SiCl t content in the product was 42 43 for contact tires of 14 17 s Thus, the redistribution reactions occurred more easily at 420 C than at 3000C. EXAMPLE 8 This Example was performed to determine what effect an increased flow rate would have on the redistribution reaction. The method of Example 6 was repeated with the same catalyst bed Zeolite 1 but in this example the average liquid flow rate was increased to 154 ml h corresponding to a gas flow rate of about 1.2 1 min so as to obtain a shorter was 2.8 s . contact time volume of catalyst gas flowrate .

The method utilized vas as illustrated in Example 6. The ethylchlorosilane mixture used had the composition shown in the first row of Table 8. The reactor temperature was at 2200C and the vaporizer at 2100C. Superficial contact times varied from 5 13 seconds, but there was little variation in CH3 3SiCl X content as noted previously for the test run at 4200C Example 7 .The temperature of the zeolite catalyst bed appears to be one of the major factors in determining the yield of C133 3SiCl M .

The feed flow rate was maintained relatively constant for 2 6 h periods and then changed as illustrated in Table 9 . The reactor temperature was maintained at 4000C and the vaporizer at 350q 3600C. At the end of the initial continuous run approximately 38 h , the catalyst was heated in a stream of dried air, about 4 1 min , at 7000C for 5 h . The reactivated catalyst was used four more hours for the redistribution of the methylchlorosilane mixture at OOO C . Table 9 shows that CH3 3SiCl M content in the product remained at 40 45 for the first 20 hours of the experiment and declined in the ensuing 18 hours to approximately half its initial value. However, the deactivated catalyst was regenerable. After only 5 h heating at 1 8 the air flow used for initial activation, the catalyst was restored to its activity at the 22 h point of the continuous reaction. This example illustrates that significantly better results were achieved utilizing the Hastelloy B reactor, as compared to the steel reactor see Table 6 ofExample 7 .

But the prior art does not teach the occurrence of the aforementioned reaction in the presence of weaker Lewis Acids, e.g.. CuCi and FeC13 even at 3S00 4S00C. However, this example illustrates that Lewis acid activatedType Y Zeolites Zeolite 1 are also redistribution catalysts for tetramethylsilane Q and dimethyldichlorosilane D mixtures. 62.7 g. of 1.6 mm alumina binded Zeolite 1 catalyst was calcined at 7000C for 5 h , as described in Example 6 in order to generateLewis acid sites. Activation and subsequent reaction were performed in the Hastelloy B reactor of Example 10. A liquid mixture containing 41.4 wt 8 CH3 4Si Q and 58.3 wt CH3 2SiC12 D was pumped at 1.04 ml min into the vaporizer held at 350 C. The calculated volumetric flow rate was 417 ml min and the contact time was 8.8 secs.Analyses of the product samples are shown in the accompanying table. It is evident that reaction occurred in accordance with the stoichiometry as follows CH3 4Si CH3 2SiCl2 Q 2 CH3 3SiClFor every mole of CH3 3 SiCl M formed, approximately twice the number of moles of CH3 2 SiCl2 D is consumed. The results are illustrated in Table 10.

The calculated gas volumetric flow rate and contact times were 346 ml min and 10.6 seconds, respectively. Analysis of the reactor effluent by gas chromatography showed CH3 3SiCl n and CH3 2SiC12 D in the products. From the data in Table 11. it is clear that the redistribution did not proceed exclusively by the reaction.EMI41.1 Other reactions, e.g.,EMI41.2 probably contributed. EXAMPLE 13 The same catalyst bed used in Examples 11 and 12 was also used in this experiment The method utilized was as illustrated in Example 6. The sethylchlorosilane composition used is shown in the first line of Table 12. The liquid feed was a blend of 73.6t SiCi4 Tet and 24.2 CH3 4Si Q . pumped at 0.65 al sin. The analysis of the two samples collected showed the presence of 13 trimethylchlorosilane M . The results are illustrated in Table 12.

In this Example. the reaction was done at 4000C on the same catalyst bed prepared for Example 11 and used forExamples 11 through 13. The average liquid flow rate was 35.3 si min. Analysis of the product samples showed that CH3 2SiHCl DM had been converted principally to CH3 2SiCl2 D . The results are illustrated in Table 13. EXAMPLE 15 The disproportionation of CH3SiHC12 MD over the catalyst bed of Example 14 yielded CH3SiC13 T as the principal product. The results obtained are illustrated in Table 14.

Since previously in the other examples, an alumina binder was utilized, this Example was performed to verify that the results achieved were due to the zeolite and not the alumina binder. 28 g of 3 .2 mm silica bonded Zeolite 1 was heated in the Hastelloy reactor of Example 10 to 7000C in a stream of dried nitrogen and maintained at that temperature for 17 hours The bed was then cooled to 4000C and a mixture of nethylchlorosilanes, having the composition illustrated in the first line of Table 15, was introduced through the vaporizer 4Ooec at the liquid flow rate of 11.4 ml h.. Analyses of the samples taken at 2 h and 3 h are shown inTable 15. EXAMPLE 17 68.1 gm of Zeolite 8, a high silica zeolite. was activated at 700 C for 5 h in aHastelloy B reactor 18 cm 2.2 cm i.d. in a 7.0SCFH flow of dried air. The bed was cooled to 300 C for reaction with a mixture of methylchlorosilanes having the composition shown in the first line ofTable 16. The liquid flow rate was 69 ml h .Samples of the product taken at 20 min and 40 min.The results are illustrated in Table 16. The performance was inferior to that of the Zeolite 1 at 220eC. It is thought that the fall off in activity is due to the decreased amount of Lewis acid sites in high silica zeolites. Nonetheless, the experiment showed that redistribution of sethylchlorosilanes is possible over zeolites covering a broad range of SiO2 Al 203 solar ratios, provided they have been activated for Lewis acid activity.
