# Light source for culturing plants.

## Abstract
A condensing lens 10 carries an optical filter 16 in a central portion thereof which includes an optical axis. The filter intercepts ultraviolet rays and infrared rays except for those which are incident on an exposed peripheral portion 12 of the lens. The filtered light is conducted by a light conducting cable 14 to a plant culturing station for photosyn thesis. The light receiving end of the cable is usually located at the focal point of visible rays output from the lens and, at the time of harvest, at the focal point of ultraviolet rays The lens may be entirely covered with the filter.
