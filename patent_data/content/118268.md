# High dielectric output circuit for electrosurgical power source.

## Abstract
A transformer circuit including a primary coil 58 with first 70 and second 72 voltage divider segments arranged in phase with equal inductances and a plurality of taps 74 on the second segment 72 . A switch 76 is used to selectably ground one of the taps for varying the voltage impressed on the second segment 72 . The transformer 60 also has a secondary coil 62 including first 80 and second 82 voltage divider segments arranged 180 out of phase and having equal inductance. The secondary coil 62 is heavily insulated, and the primary 58 and secondary 62 coils are coupled together to provide an output equal to the sum of the voltages applied to the segments of the secondary coil 62 so that the transformer output can be varied by switching from one tap to another of the second segment 72 of the primary coil 58 and that the secondary coil 62 can be heavily insulated and isolated from ground.
