# Method and apparatus for combusting ash producing solids.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for combusting particulated ash producing solids such as rice hulls, in which the solids are conveyed to an elongate cylindrical combustion cham ber, air is combined with the solids to form an air solids mixture and the mixture is longitudinally injected into the combustion chamber wherein the solids are ignited and combusted. One or more streams of relatively cool gas are tangentially injected into the interior of the combustion chamber in directions transverse to the longitudinal axis thereof so that a helical vortex is created within and along the length of the combustion chamber and the flame, ash and hot gaseous products of combustion produced therein, are caused to flow through the central portion of the combustion chamber surrounded by a sleeve of cooler gas. The ash and hot gases are cooled and the resulting ash and gases are withdrawn from the combustion chamber.
