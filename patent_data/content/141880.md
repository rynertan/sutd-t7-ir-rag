# Recording apparatus.

## Abstract
In a recording apparatus comprising a recording head with a multiplicity of individually addressable and energizable point like radiation sources arranged in staggered parallel rows 24, 25 for irradiating points across a moving photore ceptor, the driver circuits for the different rows of radiation sources are provided by identical chips 35 . Each chip incor porates delay means 39, 40 capable of holding data bit sig nals for a delay period before the signals are transmitted for energizing the associated radiation sources but is formed so that the delay means can be rendered inoperative by selecting one or other of different mode control voltage input points 51, 52 . The control chips for one row 24 of the radiation sources are set in the delay operative mode to compensate for the dis tance between the two rows of sources.
