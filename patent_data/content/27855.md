# Electrochromic display device.

## Abstract
An electrochromic display device includes a polymer film 18 deposited on the display electrode 20 . In the writing step the polymer film 18 on the display electrode 20 is oxidized to a coloured, non transparent form. In the erasing step the polymer film 18 is reduced to a neutral transparent form. A film of polyaniline is used in a preferred embodiment.
