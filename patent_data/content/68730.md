## Description
This invention relates to a drive for an engine auxiliary, eg. an alternator or a pump whereby in a low engIne speed range, the auxiliary is driven at a first speed ratio and at higher enginer speeds, the auxiliary is driven at a second speed ratio which is lower than the first. This invention also relates to a engine auxiliary, eg. an alternator or a pump, fitted with such a drive.In the case of alternators, it is important to ensure that a relatively high alternator speed is obtained even at low engine revs to ensure proper battery charging when the engine is running at low speeds. tzowever, this creates the problem that, at higher engine speeds, the alternator may be driven at an undesirably high speed. In order to overcome this problem it has been proposed in wrench patentPublication No.2 78948 to mount first and second pulleys on a crank shaft of the engine. The first pulley is larger than the second pulley and is connected via a belt h one of a pair of equal diameter pulleys on an air compressor to be driven from the engine.The other pulley of the pair on the air compressor i3 connected via another belt with the second, smaller diameter pulley. The arrangement is such that, at low engine speeds, a centrifugal coupling connects the first pulley with the crankshaft whilst the second pulley is free to rotate on the crankshaft via a free wheel coupling.At higher engine speeds, the centrifugal coupling disconnects the fIrst pulley from the crankshaft and the free wheel coupling connects the second pulley to the crankshaft so that the auxiliary is driven at a lower speed ratio from the engine. Other auxiliaries are driven by a belt either from further pulleys fixed for rotation with the first and second pulleys or from one of the pulleys associated with the air compressor.The applicants have found that the disadvantage of this type of drive is that it is difficult, if not impossIble, to fit to an existing engine where the available space directly in line wIth the crankshaft is limited It will be appreciated that in the case of engines used in motor vehicles, the engine cooling radiator will usually be disposed a very short distance in front of the engine and very close to the crankshaft pulley.Additionally, tensioning of two bolts can provide problems in that it may be necessary to provide a separate tensioner for one of the belts, particularly in the case where a further engine auxiliary cannot be driven by one of the two belts which drive the pair of driven pulleys on the first mentioned auxiliary, In another proposed two speed drive, the auxiliary itself is provided with a single pulley whIch is mounted on the drIve shaft of the auxiliary via an epicyclic gear. in such a construct Ion, a centrifugal mechanism is provided forLocking the epicyclic gear to obtain a two speed drive.However, such a construction suffers from the disadvantage that it is expensive, noisy, and requires contInuous lubrication.It is an object of the present invention to obviate or mitIgate the above dlsaÅavantages. According to one aspect of the present invention, there provided an engine auxiliary drive comprising a first driven pulley, a second driven pulley, a changeover mechanism, the pulleys and the changeover mechanism being mounted in use on a rotary input shaft of the auxiliary, the changeover mechanism being arranged so that, below a predetermined engine speed, the first pulley is drivingly connected with the rotary in3U Q shaft and the second pulley is rotatable relative to the input shaft and, above said predetermined engine speed, the second pulley is drivingly connected with the rotary input shaft and the first pulley is rotatable relative to the rotary input shaft, a further driven pulley which is preferably rotatably mounted on the auxiliary and adjustable in position relative to the first and second pulleys, but which may be a driven pulley of another engine auxiliary, a first drive belt or the like for engagement with the further pulley, a drive pulley on the engine, and one of the first and second pulleys and a second drive belt or the like for engagement with the other of the first and second pulleys and the further pulley, the arrangement being such that below said predetermined engine speed, the auxiliary is driven via the first driven pulley whilst above said predetermined engine speed, the auxiliary is drIven via the second pulley at a lower speed ratio than it is driven via the first pulley.The above described engine auxiliary drive only requires the provision of one pulley associated with the engine and so can be conveniently provided as a separately fitted drive to an exIsting auxiliary. Dhe auxiliary drive can be provided even in situatIons where there is a limited available space in the region of the engine. Additionally, the use of expensive epicyclic gear arrangement is avoided and a relatively sImple changeover mechanism whIch does not requIre lubrication can be employed. The changeover mechanism preferably lncluHes a centrifugal device which is operatIvely disposed between one of the first and second pulleys and the rotary shaft of the auxiliary, and a unidirectional clutch operatively disposed between the other of the first and second pulleys and the input shaft of the auxiliary.The further driven pulley may be stepped so that the first and second belts rlm on different effective diameters over the further pulley In which case the first and second pulleys may have the same effective diameter or it may be arranged so that the fIrst and second belts run over the same effectIve diameter, in which case the first and second pulleys will have different effective diameters.In a preferred embodiment, the centrifugal device includes at least one friction pad which is fixed for rotation with said one of the first and second pulleys,a drive plate whIch is fixed for rotation with the rotary input shaft of the auxiliary, and resilient means biasing said at least one friction pad into engagement with the drive plate, said at least one friction pad and said resilient means beIng arranged so that centrixugal forces generated when the pulley and the pad rotate in use, act in oppositIon to said resilient means.Preferably, the centrIfugal device includes a pair of friction pads, each of whIch is rotatable with said one 0 the pulleys and mounted thereon through the intermediary of a pivot so as to be pivotable towards and away from the input shaft. Each friction pad may be pivotably mounted at one of its ends with respect to said one of the pulleys and is connected with the opposIte end of the other pad vl tension spring so that the tens Ion sprIngs urge the friction pads into engagement with the rotary Input shaft or a part fixed for rotation therewith. In another embodiment, each friction pad is pivotally mounted at one of its ends with respect to said one of the pulleys and has a slot at its opposite end, sald slot being engaged by a post or the like on said one of the pulleys so that saId opposite end of each friction pad is movable relative to the first pulley towards and away from the input shaft o the auxiliary, and at least one spring which acts substantially radially is provided for urging each pad inwardly. Preferably, each spring is a compression spring which acts substantially radially. In a further embodiment, the friction pads are acted upon by leaf springs so as to urge them inwardly.The friction pads may engage in a circumferential recess in a part fixed relative to the input shaft of the auxiliary.According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an engine auxiliary drive comprising a first driven pulley, a unidirectIonal clutch through the intermediary of which the first driven pulley is mounted in use on a rotary input shaft of the engine auxilIary, a second drIven pulley adapted to be mounted on said rotary input shaft for rotating the latter, a first further pulley, a second further pulley, speed sensitive means interconnecting the further pulleys so that, above a predetermined rotary speed, rotary drIve is transmitted from the first further pulley to the second further pulley, a first drive belt or the like for engagement with a pulley on the engine and with the first driven null y and the first further pulley, and a second drive belt or the like for engagement with the second driven pulley and the second further pulley, the effective diameters of the pulleys being chosen so that, below a predetermined engine speed, the Input shaft is driven via the first and second further pulleys and the second driven pulley at a first speed ratio and, above said predetermined engIne speed, the input shaft is driven by said first driven pulley at a second speed ratio which is lower than the first speed ratio.Also according to the present invention, there is provided an engine auxiliary having a rotary input shaft fitted with an engine auxiliary drive according to the present invention.It is highly preferred for the further driven pulley to be mounted on a housing of the engine auxiliary so as to be rotatable relative thereto and movable towards and away from the axis of the rotary input shaft for belt tensioning purposes.In a preferred embodiment the second pulley has a larger effective diameter than the first pulley. The first belt preferably passes around the first pulley.In a modification, the drive from the engine to the auxiliary is effected via the second belt so that the second belt passes around the second pulley, the further pulley and the pulley associated with the engine whilst the first belt merely passes around the first pulley and the further pulley.Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, In which Fig 1 is 2 part sectional view of one embodiment of drive accordIng to the present invention fitted on a alternator,Fig 2 is a front view of the drive and alternator shown in vii5 1,Fig 3 is a view showing part of the drIve of igs I and 2, Fig 4 is a part sectional view of a second enboulmenv of a drive according to the present invention RTI ID 6.24 fitted on an alternator,Fig 5 is a front view of the drive and alternator shown InFig. 4, andFig 6 is a part sectional view of a third embodiment of a drive according to the present invention fitted on an alternator. Referring now to Figs 1 to 3, the drive illustrated therein is for transmitting drive from a crankshaft pulley on an internal combustion engine not shown in a motor vehicle to an alternator indicated generally by arrow 10. As is usual with alternators, the alternator 10 is provided with a housing 11 which is pivotally mounted on the engine via a support bolt 12 and capable of being clamped in the desired position relative to the engine by means of a mounting bracket 13 having an elongate slot 14 therein and 2 clamping bolt 15.Such a mounting arrangement for an alternator is known per se and will not be desribed in any further detail except to state that adjustment of the pivotal position of the alternator 10 about the support bolt 12 permits drive belt tensioning. In this embodIment, the drive comprises a first driven pulley 16 and a second driven pulley 17 which has a larger effective diameter than the fIrst pulley 16. The first driven pulley 16 is mounted on a rotary input shaft 18 of the alternator 10 via a bearing 19 so that it is capable ow rotating relative to the shaft 18, and is connected with the shaft 18 via a centrifugal clutch device 20 which will be described In more detail hereinafter. The second driven pulley 17 is provided on a cup shaped support member 21 in which the centrifugal clutch device 20 is located. The member 21 is connected with the rotary input shaft 18 via a needle roller clutch 22 whIch is unidirectional so that, when the shaft 18 is driven at a higher speed than the second pulley 17, relative rotation between the second pulley 17 and the shaft 18 can take place, whilst when the second pulley 17 is rotated at ç higher speed than the shaft 18 , the second pulley 17 serves to drive the shaft 18.Such a needle roller clutch 22 is an item which is known per Se and will not be described in any further detail. The member 21 is rotatable relative to the centrigufal clutch device 20.The centrifugal clutch device 20 includes a pair of friction shoes 23 and 24 see D ig 3 oniJ friction shoe 23 is illustrated in Fig 1 . The shoes 23 and 24 are identical and each comprises a pair of parallel arcuate plates 25 having an arcuate friction pad 26 secured thereto. Each shoe 23, 24 is mounted on the first pulley 16 through the intermediary of a respective pivot pin 27 passing through aligned holes in the plates 25. TensIon springs 28 are engaged with the respective pivot pins 27 and with respective mountIng screws 29.Thus, the tension springs 28 act in a directIon to urge the friction shoes 23 and 2i and the friction pads 26 inwardly oy pivoting the shoes 23 and 24 about the respective pivot pins 27. keyed to the rotary input shaft 18 radially inwardly of the clutch device 20 is a cup shaped drive plate 30 having an outer peripheral surface engageable by the friction pads 26.The drive also includes a further pulley 31 whIch is mounted on the housing 11 of the alternator so as to be freely rotatable relative thereto but movable towards and away from the axis of the rotary shaft 18 for belt tensioning purposes. The housing 11 is provIded with an integral boss 32 having a radIally directed slot 33 the further pulley 31 is mounted for free rota on on a stub shaft 34 via a bearing 35.The stub shaft 34 is engaged in the slot 33 and can be clamped in the desired radial position in the slot 33 by means of a nut engaging screw threading 37 on the shaft 34.The drive further includes a first drive belt 38 whIch passes around the first pulley 16, the further pulley 31 and the crankshaft pulley on the internal combustion engine. The drIve additionally includes a second drive belt 39 which passes around the second pulley 17 and the further pulley 31. As can be seen from Figs 1 and 2, the first and second belts 38 and 39 run over portions of the further pulley 31 which are of equal effective diameter.Tensioning of the first belt 38 can be effected in the usual way by releasing the clamping bolt 15 and pivoting the whole alternator 10 about the axis of support bolt 12. Tensioning of the second belt 39 can be effected by releasing the nut 36 and moving the further pulley 31 as permitted by movement of the stub shaft 34 in the slot 33. The second drive belt 39 is adjusted to the required tension before the tension of the first belt 38 is adjusted.In use, whilst the internal combustion engIne is operating at a low speed such as occurs under engIne Idling conditions, the first belt 38 drives the alternator 10 via the first pulley 16 at a speed whIch is determined by the ratio of the effective diameters of the crankshaft pulley and the first pulley 16.Drive from the first pulley 16 to the alternator 10 is effected via the centrifugal clutch device 20 wherein the friction pads 26 are engaged with the outer peripheral surface of the drive plate 30 under the action of the tension sprIngs 28.Because of the engagement of the first belt 38 with the further pulley 31 , the latter is also rotated and this causes the second drIve belt 39 to rotate the second pulley 17. owever, because the second pulley 17 has a greater diameter than that of the first pulley 16, it is rotated at a lower rotational speed than the rotational speed of the input shaft 18. This is permitted because of the needle roller clutch 22. Thus, at low engine speeds, the alternator 10 is driven via the first pulley 16. As the speed of the internal combustion engine rises, the centrifugal action resulting from rotation of the arcuate plates 25 and associated frIction pads 26 causes the former to be pivoted outwardly about the axes of the respective pivot pins 27. This occurs against the action of the tension springs 28. At a predetermined engine speed, the arcuate plates 25 have pivoted outwardly sufficiently far for the drIve to the input shaft 18 through the friction pads 26 and the drive plate 30 to be discontinued.As a result of this, the rotational speed of the input shaft 18 drops until it matches that of the second pulley 17, whereupon the needle roller clutch 22 drivingly connects the second pulley 17 with the input shaft 18. Thus, the alternator 10 continues to be driven by the internal combustion engine but at a lower speed ratio because of the difference in diameter between the first and second pulleys 16 and 17. In this embodiment, the centrifugal clutch device 20 is arranged so that changeover will occur at an alternator speed of 8660 rpm, the higher speed ratio is 3.3 l and the lower speed ratio is 2.2 l. It will be appreciated that the above described drive enables two alternator speed ratios from a single crankshaft pulley. If desired, further variations on the speed ratios can be achieved by arranging for the belts 38 and 39 to run on portions of the further pulley 31 which are at dIfferent effective diameters.Thus, If desired, or if necessary, the first and second driven pulleys 16 and 17 could be arranged to have the same effective diameter provided that the belts 38 and 39 run at different effective diameters on the further pulley 31Adjustment of the tension of the indIvIdual belts 38 and 39 is readily possible as will be appreciated from the above description.If desired, the above described drive may be modIfied so that the belt which passes around the second pulley 17 also passes around the crankshaft pulley of the internal combustion engine, whilst the belt whIch passes around the first pulley 16 is arranged to pass only around the further pulley 31. In a further modification, the further pulley 31 is dispensed with and the belts 38 and 39 are arranged to pass over a driven pulley of another engine auxiliary, for example a power steering pump or jockey pulley which is adjustable mounted to enable individual belt tensioning.Such pump may be positioned to provide the optimum angle of lap for the first belt 38 around the first pulley 16. Referring now to Figs. 4 and 5 of the drawings, the second embodiment illustrated therein operates to provide a two speed ratio drive and parts which are similar to that described with reference to Figs 1 to 3 are accorded the same reference numerals but preceded by the numeral 1.In this embodiment, first and second driven pulleys ll6 and 117, respectively, are of substantially the same diameter.The first pulley 116 is mounted on rotary input shaft 118 of alternator 110 zla unidirectional needle roller clutch 122. The second pulley 117 is directly keyed to the shaft 118. In place of the single further pulley 31 described above with reference to Figs. 1 to 3, in this embodIment the drive is provided with first and second further pulleys 140 and 141 which are rotatably mounted on stub shaft 134 via respective bearings 442 and 143.The first further pulley 140 has a sma r effective diameter than that of the second further pulley 141 and is provided with centrifugal clutch device 120 including parallel arcuate plates 125, frictIon pads l26, and pivot pins 127. The friction pads l26 act on sleeve 144 which forms part Of cup shaped support member 121 of the second further pulley 1 41 . The manner In which centrifugal clutch device operates is the same as that described above with reference to the centrifugal clutch device 20.First drive belt 138 passes around the crankshaft pulley not shown of the internal combustion engine, around the first driven pulley 116, and around the first further pulley 140. Second drIve belt 139 passes only around the second driven pulley 117 and the second further pulley 141.In use, whilst the internal combustion engine is operating at low speed, the first belt 138 drives the alternator 110 via the first further pulley l40, the second further pulley 141, and the second pulley 117. It is to be appreciated that, under these conditions, the friction pads 126 are engaged with the outer surface of sleeve 144 so that drive can be transmitted from the first further pulley 140 to the second further pulley 141. 3ecause of the difference in effective diameters between the pulleys 140 and l4t, the shaft 118 is driven at a higher speed than it would be i driven dIrectly by first tu ley 116. Under these conditions, rotation of the shaft 118 relative to the first pulley 116 is permitted because of the needle roller clutch 122.At a predetermined engine speed, the centrifugal clutch device 120 operates so that drive is no longer transmitted from the first further pulley 140 to the second further pulley 141 . Under these conditions, the rotational speed of the shaft 118 drops until it matches that of the first pulley 1l6, whereupon the needle roller clutch 122 drivingly connects the fIrst pulley 116 with the input shaft ll8. With the embodiment of Figs. 4 and 5, the speed of rotation of the shaft 118 below said predetermined engIne speed is governed by the ratio of the effective dIameter of the crankshaft pulley to the effective diameter of the fIrst further pulley l40, and the ratio of the effective diameter of the second further pulley 141 relative to the respective aiameter of the second pulley 117. Thus, a two stage speed increase is possible with the result that a high overall ratio can be obtained. With the embodiment of Figs. 4 and 5, the overall pulley ratio under low engine speed modes of operation can be 4 1 or higher.In the present embodiment, by way of example, the ratio is 4.44 l, there being a pulley ratio of 2 1 between the crankshaft pulley and the first further pulley 140 and a pulley ratio of 2.22 l between the second further pulley 141 and the second pulley 117. Thus, it is possible either to obtain a greater alternator output at lower engine speeds for a given size of alternator, or to obtain the same alternator output using a smaller alternator at low engine speeds.At higher engine speeds, the pulley ratio between the crankshaft pulley and the first pulley 116 can be as little as 2.0 l so that the alternator is driven relatively slowly at higher engine speeds. In this embodiment, the changeover from high ratio to low ratio , and vics versa is arranged to occur at an engine speed of about 2800 rpm. By avoiding rotation of the alternator at high speeds at higher engine speeds, it can be run efficiently. In this respect, it Is to be appreciated that, the faster an alternator is rotated, the greater the electrical losses so called Iron losses and the greater the losses through absorbtion by the alternator cooling fan wlndage losses . With the embodiment of Figs 4 to 5, during speed changing from the low ratio to the high ratio as the benzine speed decreases to below the predetermined speed , the centrifugal clutch transmits the torquf necessary to accelerate the rotor of the alternator to a higher speed.Whereas, in the embodiment of Figs. 1 to 3, the shock torque as a result of the speed change is transmitted only through the first belt 38, in the embodiment of Figs t and 5, the torquf is transmitted through both the fIrst and second belts 138 and 139 with the result that there is more resilience In the drive to absorb the shock torquf.Also, by arrangIng for a two stage speed increase, with a ratio of approximately 2 1 in each stage, as in the embodiments of Figs 4 and 5, the first belt 138 can be of a smaller size than would be necessary to provIde a 3 1 ratio for the embodiment of Figs 1 to 3.Referring now to Fig 6, the embodiment illustrated therein is similar to that of Fig 1 and similar parts are accorded the same reference numerals but preceded by the numeral 2.In this embodiment, input shaft 218 of alternator 210 has first pulley 216 mounted thereon through the Intermediary of needle roller clutch 222, and has second pulley 217 mounted thereon through the intermediary of roller bearing 219. The second pulley Is operable connected wIth shaft 218 via centrifugal clutch device 220. The first and second pulleys 216 and 217 have the same effective dIameter. Further pulley 231 comprises pulley portions 240 and 24t over which respectIve first and second belts 238 and 239 run. Further pulley 231 Is freely rotatable relative to stub shaft 234 on bearing 235. The pulley portion 240 over which first belt 238 runs has a smaller effective diameter than that of pulley portion 239 over which the second pulley 239 runs.Thus, it will be appreciated that, like the embodiment of Xigs A and 5, a two stage speed increase is obtained. tinder the low engine speed mode of operation, drive to the alternator 210 is via belt 238, further pulley 231 ,belt 239, second pulley 217, and clutch device 220 2 with the first pulley 216 rotating relative to the shaft 218. Under the high engine speed mode of operation, the clutch device 220 is disengaged and drive to the shaft 218 is taken up via the first pulley 216 and tne clutch 222.With the embodiment of Fig 6, it is possible for drive to be transmitted from the engine crankshaft pulley via the second belt 239 rather than the first pulley 238 as indicated on the drawing.The drives described above with reference to the drawings have the advantage that 1 only single crankshaft pulley on the engine is required, that 2 no jockey pulleys are required, 3 they are cheaper and easier to manufacture 4 they are quieter in use than an epicyclic pulley arrangement, 5 they require no lubrication even at very high alternator speeds up to 12000 rpm , 6 they are of relatively low mass, 7 they are easy to fit on the input shaft of the auxillary and easy and convenient to service.Additionally, since only one crankshaft pulley is realired, the modified drive can usually be fitted quite easily to an existing installation. Furthermore, the belt which does not pass around the engine crankshaft pulley need only be short. In the above described embodiments, the belts are shown as poly V belts. dowesler, it is to be appreciated that any other form of belt such as a single V or flat belt, a notched belt or a cog belt or any otherendless flexible drive element may be employed.
