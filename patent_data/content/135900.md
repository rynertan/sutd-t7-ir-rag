## Description
AQUEOUS DEVELOPABLE NEGATIVE RESIST COMPOSITIONSField Of The Invention The present invention relates to negative resist compositions useful in ultra violet lithography and in electron beam lithography. More particularly, the present invention relates to aqueous developable negative resist compositions sensitive to radiation in at least one of the near, middle and deep ultra violet regions of the spectrum, which are developable with aqueous alkaline developers and which have the ability to resolve micron size geometries in the fabrication of semiconductor devices.Background Of The Invention Resists are materials which, when exposed to high energy, such as an electron beam, or radiation of the proper wavelength, such as ultra violet radia tion, are chemically changed in their solubility or removability characteristics in certain solvents or developers. To develop a resist generally means to remove, by whatever means, those areas of the resist which are more easily removable after the resist is exposed. A common and convenient means of development is through solvents which dissolve the more easily removed portion of the selectively exposed resist layer, but leave the remaining portions sub stantially intact. A material is developable if it is removable by any of the standard methods of development known to those skilled in the art. Two types of resists are available, nega tive acting and positive acting resists. Prior to exposure, negative acting resists are soluble in developer, but with exposure they undergo chemical change and become insoluble in such developers. After selective exposure, the unexposed areas of the resist are selectively dissolved, softened, or washed away, leaving the desired resist pattern on a substrate. The remaining resist pattern is used to protect the substrate in, for example, etching processes, where surface etching of the substrate is desired only in the areas which underlie the unexposed resist. Positive acting resists work in the oppo site manner, with exposure making the resists soluble in the developer. In either case, the resist pattern that remains after development and, in some cases, post baking, is insoluble and chemically resistent to the cleaning, plating, etching or other solutions used in treating the substrate. Resists are used in the formation of inte grated circuits, printed circuit boards, photolitho graphs, name plates and the like. Resists are particularly useful in the electronics industry where a typical operation might be the coating of a sub strate, such as a silicon wafer with a thin film of a resist which is then exposed through either a posi tive or a negative of the desired image. If the resist used is a positive acting material, the exposed areas of the resist layer are rendered soluble by the exposure, and are removed by washing with a developer to uncover the underlying metal layer. The areas surrounding the uncovered metal, which were not exposed remain and protect the portions of the metal layer which they overlie.An etchant to which the resist is impervious may then be used to etch away the uncovered metal areas, or selective plating or other processes may be accomplished, and there remains a layer of resist in the desired image pattern. Later in the manufacturing process, the remaining resist pattern may or may not be removed, as desired. It is well established in the resist art that utilizing radiation in the deep ultra violet region of the spectrum for exposure of resist coated substrates results in a great increase in resolution in the developed resist and enables the reproduction of lines and spaces of very small dimensions with high image edge acuity. The ability of a resist to reproduce very small dimensions, on the order of a micron or less is extremely important in the production of large scale integrated circuits on silicon chips and similar components. Circuit density on such a chip can be increased, assuming photolithography techniques are utilized, by increasing the resolution capabilities of the resist. Deep ultra violet lithography is a rapidly maturing technology.Both 1 1 scanning projection aligners and contact proximity aligners are commercially available in deep ultra violet configurations, and feasibility of deep ultra violet step and repeat aligners is currently being investigated. However, conventional resists do not have adequate resolution and sensitivity in the deep ultra violet range of the spectrum. Methacrylate resins, based on polymethyl methacrylate and sensitized polymethyl isopropenyl ketone have been used as high resolution positive deep ultra violet resists. However, their sensitivity to deep ultra violet radiation and resistance to dry etching are not sufficient for use in practical deep ultra violet lithography processes. Positive resist systems based on a novolak resin and an ortho naphthoquinone sensitizer have been tried as deep ultra violet resists but produce images having poor profiles. The lack of high power light sources for deep ultra violet lithography requires that the deep ultra violet resists be highly sensitive.Resists for fine line lithography also need to be capable of high resolution and compatible with the dry etching environments. The deep ultra violet positive resists do not meet these requirements. Negative deep ultra violet resists employing chloromethylated polystyrene and an aromatic azide cyclized polyisoprene system have also been tried. However, they exhibit low resolution when compared with the positive deep ultra violet resists and the resolution for these negative resists is limited by the swelling induced deformation of the exposed resist patterns during development. Thus, there currently exists a need for a deep ultra violet resist system with good sensitivity, high resolution, good processing latitude and thermostability.Summary Of The Invention Aquequs developable negative resist compositions are provided which are useful in electron beam and in ultra violet lithography and which contain a polymer system comprising a phenolic resin having a weight average molecular weight of at least about 7,000 and a novolak type resin compatible with the phenolic resin, a sensitizer, and a solvent in which all three components are readily soluble.The negative resist composition of the present invention produces a resist which exhibits higher resolution than conventional cyclized rubber negative resists, does not swell during development as do such conventional negative resists, and which can be developed with aqueous alkaline developers. The negative resists of the present invention also exhibit high sensitivity to electron beams. Description Of The Preferred Embodiments The negative resist compositions of the present invention comprise a solution of a sensitizer and a polymer system comprising a phenolic resin and a novolak type resin compatible with the phenolic resin, in a compatible solvent such that the solids content of the composition is at least about 15 . It is essential that the polymer system comprise a phenolic resin and a novolak type resin since the use of either polymer alone in conjunction with the sensitizers of the present invention, does not result in a resist composition having properties comparable to those of the composition of the present invention. The phenolic resin has a weight average molecular weight of at least about 7,000, more pref erably within the range of from about 10,000 to about 40,000, and even more preferably within the range of from about 15,000 to about 30,000, and is present in the composition in an amount of from about 10 to about 95 , preferably from about 50 to about 95 , by weight of the polymer system in the composi tion. Phenolic resins useful in the present inven tion are represented by the following structural formula EMI5.1 wherein A is a covalent bond, 0 , CH2 , OC O , C O O , or C O OCH2 , preferably a covalent bond or OC O , more preferably a covalent bond, and R1 is H, F, Cl, Br, or I, preferably H or F.Particularly preferred as the phenolic resin are those resins represented by the following structural formula EMI6.1 wherein R1 has its previously assigned meaning. The novolak type resin useful in the pre sent invention can be any such resin which is compat ible with the phenolic resin both in coating charac teristics, that is, which produces in combination with the pheolic resin a homogenous and uniform resist coating, and in rate of solubility in the aqueous alkaline developer. Preferred as the novolak type resin is a cresol formaldehyde novolak resin or a phenol formaldehyde novolak resin. The cresol formaldehyde novolak resins are particularly pre ferred and are preferably prepared as described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent 4,377,631. The novo lak type resin is present in an amount of from about 5 to about 90 , preferably from about 5 to about 50 , by weight of the polymer system in the composi tion.Suitable novolak type resins are represented by the following structural formula EMI6.2 wherein R2 and R3 are independently H or monovalentC1 to C4 alkyl. The sensitizer is selected from the group consisting of bisarylazides, monoarylazides, and mixtures thereof provided that it is soluble in the composition in an amount sufficient to insolubilize the exposed photoresist. The concentration required will depend on the specific sensitivity of the sensitizer employed.Preferably, the sensitizer is selected from the group consisting ofEMI7.1 EMI7.2 and mixtures thereof, wherein L is a covalent bond, CH2 , CH CH , C CH3 2 , CO SO2 , O or S , M is a covalent bond, CH2, CH CH ,EMI7.3 CH CH CO , C CH3 2 , CO , S , O , or SO2 ,R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 and R10 are selected independently from H and N3, provided that R4 R5, and provided that R6 and R7 cannot be N3 at the same time, R8 and R9 cannot be N3 at the same time and at least one of R6, R7, R8 and R9 is N3, and R1l is H or monovalent C1 to C9 alkyl, preferably monovalent C1 to C4 alkyl, and more preferably CH CH3 2.The sensitizer is present in an amount of from about 4 by weight based on total solids in the composition up to its saturation point, preferably from about 4 to about 35 by weight based on total solids in the composition. Preferred are those compounds in which R4 H and R5 N3 those in which R6 R8 andR7 R9 and those in which R6 R7 H. When deep ultra violet sensitization is desired, the sensitizer is preferably selected from the group consisting ofEMI8.1 and mixtures thereof, wherein Q and T are selected independently from CH2 , C CH3 2 , CO , SO2 , O and S , and R4, R5, R6, R7, R8 and R9 have their pre viously assigned meanings.A particularly preferred deep ultra violet sensitizer isEMI8.2 When near ultra violet sensitization is desired, the sensitizer is preferably selected from the group consisting of EMI9.1 and mixtures thereof, wherein R6, R7, R8, R9 and R1l have their previously assigned meanings. When extended near deep ultra violet sensi tization is desired, blends of the near and deep ultra violet sensitizers are employed. The negative resist compositions contain the sensitizer, novolak type resin and the phenolic resin in amounts such that the composition contains at least about 15 solids, preferably from about 15 to about 40 solids, and more preferably from about 20 to about 30 solids. A particularly preferred deep ultra violet sensitive negative resist composition comprises a solution of a deep ultra violet sensitizer and a polymer system comprising a polyvinyl phenol compound and a novolak type resin compatible with the phenolic resin, in which the deep ultra violet sensitizer is a compound selected from the group consisting of EMI10.1 and mixtures thereof, wherein Q, T, R4, R5, R6, R7,R8 and R9 have their previously assigned meanings, and is present in an amount of about 4 by weight of the total solids in the composition up to the saturation point of the sensitizer, preferably from about 4 to about 35 , the phenolic resin has a weight average molecular weight of at least about 7,000, preferably from about 10,000 to about 40,000, and is represented by the following structureEMI10.2 wherein A and R1 have their previously assigned meanings, and is present in an amount of from about 10 to about 95 by weight of the polymer system in the composition, preferably from about 50 to about 95 , the novolak type resin is present in an amount of from about 5 to about 90 by weight of the polymer system in the composition, preferably from about 5 to about 50 , the solvent is a mixture of ethylcellosolve acetate, butyl acetate, xylene and cyclohexanone, and the composition has a total solids content of from about 15 to about 40 . The compositions are formed by adding the sensitizer, the phenolic resin and the novolak type resin to a solvent in which all three components are readily soluble. The order of addition is not critical. The solvent is preferably selected from the group consisting of aliphatic ketones, aliphatic esters, alkylene glycol monoalkyl ethers, dialkylene glycol monoalkyl ethers, alkylene glycol dialkyl ethers, and mixtures thereof. A particularly preferred class of aliphatic esters are the aliphatic alkylene glycol alkyl ethyl esters. More preferably, the solvent is selected from the group consisting of cyclohexanone, methylcellosolve acetate, ethylcellosolve acetate, butyl acetate and mixtures thereof. A particularly preferred solvent for use with deep VU compositions is a mixture of ethylcellosolve acetate, butyl acetate, and xylene.The choice of solvent will depend on the specific phenolic resin, novolak type resin and sensitizer employed. After the phenolic resin, the novolak type resin and the sensitizer have been added to the solvent, the mixture is agitated until all solids are dissolved. The resultant resist solution is microfiltered, preferably using a millipore microfiltration system under about 30 pounds per square inch of pressure of nitrogen or other inert, oxygen free ambient atmosphere. Additives such as dyes, anti striation agents, plasticizers, adhesion promoters, speed enhancers, and non ionic surfactants may be added to the solution of the novolak resin, the phenolic resin and the sensitizer before the solution is filtered. Dye additives useful with the negative resist compositions of the present invention includeMethyl Violet 2B C.I. No. 42535 , Crystal Violet C.I. No. 42555 , Malachite Green C.I. No. 42000 ,Victoria Blue B C.I. No. 44045 and Neutral Rec C.I. No. 50040 at 0.1 to 1.0 percent weight levels, based on the combined weight of the novolak resin and the sensitizer. The dye additives may help provide increased resolution by inhibiting back scattering of light off the substrate. Anti striation agents may be used up to a five percent weight level, based on the combined weight of the novolak type resin and the sensitizer. Plasticizers which may be used include, for example, phosphoric acid tri ss chloroethyl ester stearic acid dicamphor acetal resins phenoxy resins and alkyd resins at 1 to 10 weight levels, based on the combined weight of the novolaktype resin and the sensitizer. The plasticizers improve the coating properties of the material and enable the application to the substrate of a film that is smooth and of uniform thickness. Adhesion promoters which may be used include, for example, B 3,4 epoxy cyclohexyl ethyl trimethoxysilane p methyl disilane methyl methacrylate vinyltrichlorosilane and y amino propyl triethoxysilane up to a 4 percent weight level, based on the combined weight of the novolak type resin and the sensitizer. Speed enhancers that may be used include, for example, picric acid, nicotinic acid or nitrocinnamic acid at a weight level of up to 20 percent, based on the combined weight of the novolak type resin and the sensitizer. These enhancers tend to increase the solubility of the resist coating in both the exposed and unexposed areas, and thus they are used in applications where speed of development is the overriding consideration even though some degree of contrast may be sacrified. Thus while the unexposed areas of the resist coating will be dissolved more quickly by the developer, the speed enhancers will also cause a larger loss df resist coating from the exposed areas. Non ionic surfactants that may be used include, for example, nonylphenoxy poly ethyleneoxy ethanol octylphenoxy ethyleneoxy ethanol and dinonylphenoxy poly ethyleneoxy ethanol at up to 10 percent weight levels, based on the combined weight of novolak type resin and the sensitizer. The filtered resist composition can be applied to a substrate by any conventional method used in the resist art, including dipping, spraying, whirling and spin coating. When spin coating is employed, the percent total solids content is selected to provide coatings of the desired thickness given the type of spinning equipment utilized and the spin speed and the amount of time allowed for the spinning process. The resist coatings produced by the abovedescribed procedure are particularly suitable for application to thermally grown silicon silicon dioxide coated wafers such as are utilized in the production of microprocessors and other miniaturized integrated circuit components. An aluminum aluminum oxide wafer can be used as well. After the resist composition is coated onto the substrate, the substrate is baked at approximately 100 to 1050C until substantially all the solvent has evaporated and only a thin coating of the resist, on the order of a micron in thickness, remains on the substrate. The coated substrate can then be exposed, using ultra violet radiation or an electron beam, in any desired exposure pattern produced by use of suitable masks, negative stencils, templates, or the like. The negative resists can be exposed using commercially available equipment, for example, a Perkin Elmer 1 1 Projection Micralign 500 Model which can be set to operate in the near about 400 to about 350 nm , mid about 350 to about 280 nm , or deep about 280 to about 220 nm ultra violet ranges of the spectrum. The exposed negative resist coated substrates are then substantially immersed in developing solution in, for example, a Teflon tank. The solution is preferably agitated, for example, by nitrogen burst agitation. The substrates are allowed to remain in the developer until all, or substantially all, of the negative resist coating has been dissolved from the unexposed areas. The negative resist compositions of the present invention form negative resists which are soluble in aqueous alkaline developers and which can be developed with positive resist developers.The developer formulation is not critical and typical of the developers useful with the negative resists of the present invention is WX 402, an aqueous alkaline positive resist developer manufactured by Philip A. Hunt Chemical Corporation. Typical development conditions are 23 2 C, with the development time depending largely on the pre bake temperature and time, exposure energy, developer strength and the developer mode such as spray, puddle, nitrogen burst submersion or mechanical agitation. For example, under mild magnetic bar agitation, using 50 WX 402 developer in the immersion mode, developing times typically range between about 70 and about 150 seconds for 1 micron coatings pre baked at about 750 to about 1050C for about 20 to about 50 minutes. In general, increasing the exposure energy requires increasing the development time in order to wash out resist in fine window geometries. Different development times are required to remove identical resist thicknesses at different pre bake temperatures and the exposure energy employed is related to the unexposed resist development times. Increasing the exposure energy as well as employing high pre bake temperatures results in slower development rates and provides greater development contrast. With the deep ultra violet compositions, the imaged resist surface receives greater exposure energy than the resist bottom and therefore the top surface of the image becomes sufficiently insoluble in the developer to retain a high film thickness after development. The underlying resist is protected from attack by the developer. However, as the development of unexposed resist progresses, the side walls of the exposed image progressively develop at a greater rate than that of the upper layers of the resist. Increased development times result in further erosion of the resist base and produce negatively sloped resist walls. Most common deep ultra violet positive resist systems provide sloped profiles caused by the internal absorption of the surface layers of the resist. By selecting a specific exposure energy and development time, exact mask reproduction of 1 micron and greater is possible with the deep ultra violet compositions of the present invention. Reducing or increasing the exposure energy accompanied by suitable adjustments in the development times produces smaller or larger resist line widths than the mask window dimensions. After removal of the coated wafers from the developing solution, a post development heat treatment or bake may be employed to increase the adhesion and chemical resistance to etching solutions and other substances. The post development heat treatment can be effected by oven baking of the coating and substrate at a temperature below the softening point of the coating. In industrial applications, particularly in the manufacture of microcircuitry units on silicon silicon dioxide type substrates, the developed substrates are typically treated with a buffered, hydrofluoric acid based etching solution. The negative resists of the present invention are resistant to acid based etching solutions and provide effective protection for the resistcoated areas of the substrate. The negative resists of the present invention provide greater resolution capabilities than the cyclized rubber based negative resist systems, provide high speed deep ultra violet resists, exhibit high plasma etch resistance and exhibit high thermal deformation resistance. The deep ultra violet compositions exhibit excellent step coverage properties.Uniform image resist line widths can be produced which do not exhibit any signs of necking at the edge of steps. The deep ultra violet negative resists of the present invention are capable of producing submicron geometries and resist lines having vertical side walls and an approximate width of at least 0.4 micron can be produced.Examples The following examples present illustrative but non limiting embodiments of the present invention. Comparative examples are also provided.Resist film thicknesses in the following examples were measured using a Sloan Dektak Profilometer.The resist coatings in the following examples were exposed using either a Perkin Elmer 1 1 ProjectionMicralign 500 Model which could be set to operate in the near, mid or deep ultra violet ranges of the spectrum, or a Kaspar Instruments contact exposure unit Model 2001 retrofitted for deep ultra violet with an Optical Associates Inc. Model 23T light source.

The resulting composition contained 25 total solids with a sensitizer weight ratio to total solids of about 20 in a solvent comprising 58.3 of the 80 10 10 solvent and 41.7 of cyclohexanone. Four wafers were coated with the composition two at 5,000 rpm and two at 4,500 rpm. After spinning, the wafers were dried for about 30 minutes at a temperature between 80 and 1000C. One of the 5,000 rpm wafers was exposed to ultra violet light 400 nm for 40 seconds and then developed in a metal ioncontaining aqueous alkaline developer a 27 solu tion of LSI developer .

For comparative purposes, primed and unprimed wafers were coated with comparative compositions E, F and G at 4,000 rpm and pre baked at 850 to 900C for 30 minuts after which they were exposed through a multi density mask using ultra violet radiation 260 nm at an intensity of 3.65 m.wt. cm2, and then developed after which they were rinsed for one minute in water acidified with acetic acid followed by a one minute rinse in water, all as summarized in Table 4. Example 4 Comparative A comparative composition was prepared containing 27 solids by dissolving 5.4g of 3,3 diazidodiphenyl sulfone in a solvent comprising 36.5g of ethylcellosolve acetate and 36.5g of cyclohexanone and then adding 21.6g of the novolak resin described in example 1. The composition contained 20 sensitizer and 80 novolak resin, by weight of the total solids. The composition when coated on a wafer, pre baked and exposed to deep ultra violet radiation 260 nm provided poor imaging but tended to provide positive imaging with strong developer.

The composition was used to coat five 2 inch primed wafers at 3,000 rpm. The coated wafers were dried at 1000 to 1050C resulting in 0.56 micron film thicknesses.The wafers were exposed to near ultra violet radiation 400 to 350 nm through a multi density mask and then developed, all as summarized in Table 5. A visible, colored image was observed after exposure and prior to development. Example 6 A composition was prepared by dissolving 0.5g of 2,6 di 94 azidobenzal 4 methylcyclohexanone in about 25g of cyclohexanone followed by the addition of 4g of a 3,000 Mw polyvinyl phenol. 0.4g of the novolak resin described in example 1 were then added. The sample was then micro filtered and had a total solids content of 16.3 . Six unprimed wafers were coated at 3,000 rpm with the solution and then pre baked at 1000 to 105 C for 30 minutes resulting in film thicknesses of 0.792 micron. The wafers were exposed using a multi density mask on a contact exposure unit using ultra violet radiation 380 nm at 3.2 m.wt. cm2 intensity and then developed, all as summarized in Table 6. Example 7 A composition was prepared by dissolving 10.8g of 3,3 diazidodiphenyl sulfone in 57.8g of cyclohexanone with slight warming and then adding 5.4g of the novolak resin described in example 1 were then added followed by 126g of a 30 solids polyvinyl phenol 10,000 Mw solution in ethylcellosolve acetate, with mixing until dissolved. The solution contained 27 total solids of which 70 were PVP, 10 were novolak resin and 20 were sensitizer.

A portion of the solution was used to coat wafers which when exposed to ultra violet radiation 280 to 210 nm through a mask and developed for 70 seconds with a 20 solution of a metal ion free aqueous alkaline developer and examined by scanning electron microscopy exhibited good resist profiles. The 1 micron as well as the 0.6 to 0.75 micron lines were well resolved. Example 8 Four compositions were prepared as followsComposition H was prepared by adding to 150g of the composition prepared in example 7, 23 microliters of a commercially available solution of an antistriation agent. Composition I was prepared by combining 8.125g of a 30,000 Mw polyvinyl phenol, 1.875G of the novolak resin described in example 1, 2.5g of 4,4 diazidodiphenyl methane and 25g of cycloxehanone. The solution had a total solids content of 25 of which 65 were PVP, 15 were novolak resin and 20 were sensitizer. Composition J was prepared by combining 8.775g of a 13,000 Mw polyvinyl phenol, 2.025g of the novolak resin described in example 1, 2.7g of 4,4 diazidodiphenyl methane and 23g of cyclohexanone. The solution contained 27 total solids of which 65 were PVP, 15 were novolak resin and 20 were sensitizer.Composition K was identical to the formulation prepared in example 7. Wafers were coated with compositions H,I, J and K at a spin speed of 7,000 rpm and the coatings pre baked at 1000 to 1050C for 30 minutes after which they were exposed through either a multidensity mask or a resolultion mask using ultra violet radiation at an intensity of 3.95 m.wt. cm2 260 nm and then developed, all as summarized in Table 7.

Wafer 3 showed the best resolution but appeared to have lost some film, perhaps due to over development. Wafers 1 and 5 appeared to have been underdeveloped. Wafers 6 and 7 both showed high levels of underdeveloped spots of resist in unexposed areas and wafer 8 showed some film thickness loss and signs of overexposure. Example 10 Compositions N, O, P and Q were prepared as follows. Composition N was prepared by diluting 18.61g of composition I prepared in example 8 with 2.54g of butyl acetate to provide a solution having 22 total solids. Composition 0 was prepared by diluting 12.73g of sample J prepared in example 8 with 2.216g of butyl acetate to provide a solution having 23 total solids. Composition P was prepared by diluting 18.73g of composition N with 1.873g of butyl acetate to provide a solution having 20 total solids. Composition Q was prepared by diluting 12.57g of composition 0 with 1.8855g of butyl acetate to provide a solution having 20 total solids. Each composition was coated on wafers at two different spin speeds and a development time for complete film removal was determined. The results are summarized in Table 10. Because the coatings showed severe stria tions, a very small amount of an anti striation agent was added to each composition and wafers coated with the modified compositions produced coatings without striations. Compositions P and Q containing the anti striation agent were used to coat primed 3 inch Table 9 Film Exposure Development Develper Wafer Number Composition Thickness Time Sec.

The wafers were coated at 7,550 rpm for 30 seconds and were then pre baked at 1010 to 1050C for 30 minutes. The wafers were exposed to ultra violet light 260 nm through a resolution mask at an intensity of 3.8 m.wt. cm . The wafers were then developed and evaluated, all as summarized in Table 11.The large unexposed areas of the resist consistently showed large numbers of undeveloped resist areas and in some cases also showed unwashed residual spots. Example 11 Composition R was prepared by dissolving 11.2g of 4,4 diazidodiphenyl methane in 112.5g of cyclohexanone followed by the addition of 112.5g of ethylcellosolve acetate, 48.75g of a 30,000 Mw polyvinyl phenol and 15g of the novolak resin described in example 1 to provide a solution having 25 total solids. This composition produced film thicknesses of 1.06 microns at 4,000 rpm, 0 88 micron at 5,000 rpm and 0.78 micron at 7,000 rpm when the coatings were dried for 30 minutes at 1000 to 1050C. Seven primed wafers were coated with composition R and then pre baked at 1000 to 1050C for 30 minutes. The wafers were exposed to ultra violet radiation at an intensity of 3.5 m.wt. cm2 260 nm through a resolution mask and then developed and evaluated, all as summarized in Table 12.

The solution was then microfiltered. The resulting solution comprised 6.25 weight novolak resin solids, 15.75 weight PVP solids, 3.00 weight sensitizer solids, and 75.00 weight solvent. For every 100g of these four components, 0.065 weight of the anti striation agent was added. The ultraviolet absorption of this composition was determined and it was found that the composition was very transparent at 700 to 550 nm and rapidly increased in absorbance to a high level off scale below 350 nm.Three films were formed from the solution and the absorbance measured. The absorbance for each film had two peaks, one at 280 nm and another at 200 nm.The results are summarized in Table 15.
