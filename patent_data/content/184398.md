# Analog to digital conversion.

## Abstract
A narrow bandwidth analog to digital conversion ADC system is described in the context of the color burst processing and burst phase detecting circuitry of a digital color television receiver. The ADC 14 includes a dither generator which adds a dither signal to either the analog input signal 10 or to the reference signal 38 used by the ADC. This dither signal increases in magnitude by 1 16 of an LSB value at a rate one quarter of the burst frequency and changes in sign at one half of the burst frequency. This signal passes through a low pass filter 18 in the chromi nance channel providing an increase in sample resolution by averaging the samples in a chroma band pass filter and in the phase detecting circuitry 30 .
