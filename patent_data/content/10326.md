# Colour television display tube.

## Abstract
In a colour television display tube the electron gun sys tem constructed from three electron guns 6,7,8 comprises a first group of corresponding electrodes 23, 23a, 23b and a second group of corresponding electrodes 24,24a,24b to be operated at a higher electrical potential than the first group. The electrodes are positioned relative to each other by means of metal braces 25 connected thereto the ends 26 of which are secured in supporting rods 27 consisting of an insulating material. The electric interconnection of at least the first group of corresponding electrodes has been realized by means of one or more metal contact springs 28 which collectively sur round the supporting rods 27 and touch the surface thereof.
