# Method of determining concentration of a component in gases and electrochemical device suitable for practicing the method.

## Abstract
A method of detecting the concentration of a component in gases, by an electrochemical element comprising a pumping cell 2 having a first and a second electrode 6, 8 on a solid electrolyte layer 4 , and a sensing cell 12 comprising a third and a fourth electrode 16, 18 disposed on another solid elec trolyte layer 14 , the first and third electrodes being located adjacent to each other, end exposed to the gas to be measured which has been diffused with a predetermined diffusion resi stance. A primary pumping current is applied to the pumping cell to control the partial pressure of the component in the at mosphere adjacent to the first and third electrodes. The prima ry pumping current is controlled so that an electromotive force induced on the sensing cell coincides with a predetermined va lue. The method comprises a step of applying an auxiliary pum ping current between the third electrode of the sensing cell, and one of the other three electrodes, for effecting an auxiliary pumping operation so as cause a change in the partial pressure of the component in the atmosphere adjacent to the third elec trode, in the same direction as a change in the partial pressure in the atmosphere adjacent to the first electrode, which is cau sed by the primary pumping current. Also disclosed is an elec trochemical device for practicing the method.
