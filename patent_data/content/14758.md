# Device for optical character reading.

## Abstract
A device for optical character reading comprising an opti cal reading unit 4 , a video detector 5 , a segmenting unit 2 , a video buffer 6 , a recognition unit 3 and a controlling micro computer 1 . The computer 1 controls the setting of a threshold value in the video detector 5 , calculates by means of profile data received from the segmenting unit 2 coordi nates for a starting point for recognizing a character in the recognition unit 3 . A comparator in the recognition unit 3 compares bit by bit mask bits from a read only storage with corresponding data bits from the video buffer 6 and stores the result into a status register. A recognized character is transferred from the read only storage to a character register, the computer 1 is interrupted and a character is transferred from the recognition unit 3 to the computer 1 . The video detector 5 comprises selectively connectable and computer controlled attenuation resistors for setting up a threshold signal curve simulating the shape of the video signal curve.
