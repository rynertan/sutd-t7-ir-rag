# Sleeving.

## Abstract
A method of coating a fibrous material tube for use as electrical insulation which comprises applying to the tube a solventless epoxy resin system an curing the resin. The instertices in the tube are sufficiently small that they do not allow full impregnation of the resin through to the inside of the tube before curing. The tube is preferably knitted on a circular knitting machine and thus may be produced con tinuously and coated continuously at a greater speed than was hitherto possible with graded tubes and solvent resin systems.

## Description
SLEEVINGThis invention relates to a method of producing coated sleeving in particular coated electrical sleeving.Sleeving, for example for use as electrical insulation, has hitherto been produced from braided material, for example, glass fibre, which is then coated with an elastomeric composition. Common elastomers employed include silicone rubbers and acrylic latices, both of which are applied from solvent based systems. The elastomer solution is applied to the braiding and, before curing of the elastomer can take place, the solvent must be removed. This entails a relatively long residence time within an oven or other heating zone firstly to remove the solvent, and then to effect curing of the elastomer. In order to keep the heating zone down to a reasonable size, it is therefore necessary to ensure that the sleeving passes through the heating zone at a relatively slow rate, typically in the order of 1 meter per minute.The invention seeks to provide a method of producing sleeving, suitable for use as electrical insulation, which is very much faster than known methods.In its broadest aspect, the invention provides a method of coating a fibrous material tube which comprises applying to the tube a solvent less epoxy resin system and curing the resin, the interstices in the tube being sufficiently small that they do not allow full impregnation of the resin through to the inside of the tube before curing. or wovenThe tube may be braided rom fibrous materials but is preferably, according to the invention, a knitted tube produced on a circular knitting machine.The fibrous materials employed may in general comprise any textile fibre, but for the properties of heat resistance required for electrical insulation.it is preferred that textile fibres having high resistance to heat are employed or, preferably, that glass fibres are employed.Consequently the invention also provides a process in which a tube is knitted from a glass fibre yarn on a circular knitting machine, a solvent free resin system is applied to the knitted tube, and the resin cured.Employing the process of the invention enables sleeving to be produced at a much faster rate than hitherto. For example, employing a curing oven of approximately half the size of a conventional oven used for curing solvent based silicone rubber systems, a through put speed in the order of 15 meters per minute can be obtained compared with conventional speeds of around 1 meter per minute.Where the end use of the sleeving is for electrical insulation, this will have to meet specified voltage resistance requirements. Commonly a voltage resistance in excess of 3000 volts is required. According to the process of the invention a voltage resistance in the order of 4000 volts is produced with one pass through the coating system and curing zone. With the conventional solvent based systems two or more passes would be needed through the coating and curing zone effectively reducing the rate of production. In order to produce the very good coating according to the invention with one pass, the knitted tube presented to the coating zone should be bf close mesh construction to prevent impregnation through to the inside of the tube.This will to some extent depend on the viscosity of the resin system used. One marked advantage of using knitted tubes is that they may be produced both quickly and continuously in indefinite lengths. Thus long runs of tube may be coated and cured at the high speed possible with the resin system employed. Short runs are, in general, not economical since the handling between runs, which is labour intensive, is increased, and the resin system is itself more expensive than the conventional solution based systems. The particular combination of the preferred form of the invention employing long runs of knitted tube coated at high speed with an epoxy resin, enables a superior product to be obtained extremely economically. The resin system employed in accordance with the invention is an epoxy resin, preferably a long chain epoxy resin with an acid polyester hardner. Such systems are solvent less and are usually two pack, but need not be so. The following Example will illustrate the invention. EXAMPLE A fibrous material tube was produced by knitting on a circular knitting machine in a continuous manner a glass fibre yarn. The bore of the tube knitted was 10 mm. arid the average size of the interstices in the knitted structure was 0.1 x 0.2 mm. To the knitted tube was applied a solventless epoxy resin and hardner system MS 7323 and MS 7108 Ciba Geigy under pressure evenly to coat the fabric tube. The resin system is a thixotropic paste. The coated tube is then cured by passing it through an oven maintained at 3000 C at a rate of 12m minute.The product so produced was found to be evenly coated, flexible, and with no strike through of the resin into the bore of the tube. Other properties of the product were as follows 0Thermal classification Class F 155 C Maximum short term temperature 2200 CElectric strength at 206 C 1 min. proof 4 kVThe product was produced continuously in long runs and thereafter cut into lengths and wound on standard reels.
