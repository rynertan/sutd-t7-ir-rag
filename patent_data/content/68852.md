# A method and an apparatus for treating range and direction information data.

## Abstract
Analog video information from a radar antenna rotating once each 2 seconds and emitting 2000 pulses per second is digitized by an A D converter 15 which feeds a sweep memory 16 comprising 1024 range cells each storing one pixel. The analog antenna bearing DIAMETER is digitized by a synchro digital converter 19 and its sine and cosine fetched from a ROM table and supplied to X and Y rate multipliers 18 whose other input is a constant frequency. The pixels in the sweep memory 16 are written to X and Y coordinate addresses, determined from their range and bearing coordinates by the rate multipliers, in an intermediate storage block memoy 17 . Of the 4.090.000 pixels per antenna rotation, a central processor unit 20 , operating in accordance with an algorithm, writes only 1048576 final pixels, four at a time, to a radar display refresh memory 3, 21 from which these pixels, in cartesian coordinate format, are transferred in page mode through a line buffer 30 to a D A video output unit 5 and thence to a monitor 4 which provides a raster scan display of 1024 x 1024 pixels corresponding to the PPI information produced by the antenna. In controlling the transfer of pixels from the block memory 17 to the radar display refresh memory 3, 21 , the central processor unit 20 forms and uses a table of memory block addresses associated with 4096 possible antenna bearing values, each memory block occurring once only in the table.

## Description
A method and an apparatus for treating range and direction information data The present invention relates to a method for treating range and direction information data, and more specifically to the conversion of such data from a first scan format to a different scan format, so as to enable a more convenient display to be provided. Such conversion may be of a topographic picture related to a radar sensor and have a scan format in polar coordinates, the polar coordinates after conversion being transformed to cartesian coordinates which are displayed on a high resolution raster scan monitor having an appropriate refresh rate. The invention also relates to the transfer of the converted data from a display memory to the raster scan monitor. Further the invention also relates to an apparatus for carrying out the method. Although the present invention will be described in connection with the conversion of radar pictures from a radar sensor related polar coordinate format to pictures of identical content, but having a cartesian coordinate format, it is to be understood that the invention will also be applicable to systems which are not necessarily associated with radar pictures and the further treatment of such converted data for the display thereof on a monitor. The tracing of a radar plan position picture is generally carried out on a plan position indicator PPI by means of a sequence of radial display sweeps rotating in syncronism with one or more radar antennas. The echosor target signals will then appear as long persistence phosphor markings, the decaying afterglow thereof serving as a memory function. Several different techniques for converting such a PPI picture to one of higher and steadier brightness have been suggested already. In an article written by J. Gietema in PhillipsTelecommunication Review, Vol. 37 No. 2, May 1979 A digital scan converter for radar pictures , the replacement is suggested of the memory functionof the phosphor, bilateral target or TV camera by that of a solidstate random access memory. In the same article it is stated that if it is possible to make the input and output speeds of such a memory high enough it is possible to arrive at a solid state digital scan converter, which excels in resolution, accuracy, stability and MTBF, whilst offering such latitude in the admixture of synthetics and facilitating control over, and processing of, the entire picture content. In the above article it is suggested that the converting medium should be constituted by a dynamic MOS memory with 16k modules, the memory being built up from 1024x1024 topography related storage cells each having a capacity of 5 bits. This gives a total capacity of approximately 5 Mb, which is comparable to a computer memory capacity of 320kx16 bit words. However, although the article suggests a converting medium comparable to a computer it is to be noted that no computer can straight away handle the indicated number of data items at sufficiently high speed, i.e. a speed which has to be adapted to the scanning velocity of the radar beam. In British Patent Specification 1.529.281 there is described a possible way of overcoming the problems of writing into a display memory and refreshing a CRT monitor with data from the display memory within the available time by applying a technique whereby a sweep data buffer and the display memory are both segmented into several parts, and the scan conversion and writing into the display memory is performed simultaneously for each segment of the sweep data buffer. An object of the present invention is to solve the time problems discussed above in a different manner which will be described in principle below as compared with the prior art technique. In the prior art technique, a radar sweep buffer contains digital radar data from one radial sweep appropriately stored in nl storage elements, each holding ml bits of amplitude information.The radar data is fed into the sweep buffer by sampling the radar video signal at a suitable sampling rate, and at each sampling time converting the video signal to digital form by use of an A D converter with ml bits, the digitized radar video signals being stored and sampled in consecutive locations in the sweep buffer. The radar is operating at k pulses per second, and the scanner rotates one revolution in Trot seconds. The radar data held in the sweep buffer is converted from polar to cartesian coordinates by applying two rate multipliers to increment x and y address registers from a defined starting value, values of sine and cosine representing the radar scanner bearing and a clock signal being the input signals to the rate multipliers.The radar data is stored in one pixel at a time. The display memory which is connected to the above de scribed coordinate converter, consists of N by N memory locations, each hold m2 bits of amplitude information.The contents of the display memory is read regularly, line by line and transferred to refresh a CRT display monitor with N active picture lines. The display picture is refreshed j times per second. During refresh reading, n pixels are read simultaneously on the same clock cycle. If the display memory has a cycle time of ql nanosec.for writing and q2 nanosec. for reading, the above known configuration comprising the radar sweep buffer, the coordinate converter and the display memory will have the following time budget for the display memory Number of read accesses to refresh one display picture N2 na n Percent of time occupied for display refresh rp 100 na . q2 . 10 9 . j Number of write accesses for one radar sweep n1 Percent of time occupied for writing a rw 100 . n1 . q1 . 10 9 . k Assume as a calculation example thatN 1024, n 64, ql q2 500, n1 1024, k 2000, j 60This gives na 16384, and 49,15 The time consumed for writing is a rw 102,4 Since the sum of r and ra exceeds 100 approx. 150 , w this design will not function with the selected numerical values, which are quite relevant. If according to the present invention the scan converted data is first written in an intermediate storage unit when being released from the coordinate converter and later read to a refresh display memory by a data bus, in which the transfer of data takes place with a plurality of pixels in parallel, i.e. z pixels at the same time, the following two advantages are achieved 1. The number of write accesses is reduced because of a larger number of pixels per write access to the refresh memory. 2. The number of write accesses to the refresh memory is reduced because it is possible to design an arrangement such that each pixel in the refresh memory is updated only once per antenna revolution. The second advantage arises from the invention as follows During one complete rotation of the antenna or other sensor, a certain number, say 4096000, of pixels are produced. Howeyer, the angle through which the antenna turns between one pulse and the next is so small that some elementary areas corresponding to respective pixels, are irradiated several times during one complete rotation of the antenna. All the pixels produced by the antenna are written to the intermediate storage unit, but only the last pixel data which appears after the radar beam or equivalent sensor vector has passed the corresponding elementary areas scanned is transferred to the refresh memory. The passing of scanned areas by the beam or other vector is monitored by an algorithm.For example, there are 4096000 writing accesses to the intermediate storage unit, but with a refresh memory capacity of 1024 x 1024 pixels, only 1048576 final pixels are transferred from the intermediate storage unit to the refresh memory. No updating of the same pixel is effected in the refresh memory, and the number 1048576 corresponds in this example to the number of pixels appearing on the raster scan display. For the same type of display memory, the display refresh time remains constant. The number of write to refresh memory cycles per second is now 1 Nê nb Trot . z and the percent of time occupied for writing rb 100 . nb . ql . 10 9 w For the same calculation example, with z 4 and Trot 2 see, nb 131072 b rw 6,55 The total time consumption for the refresh memory is now rp rb 55 7 w which is far from critical. The time budget for the intermediate storage unit is a b rbuf rw rw It will be seen that with the same numerical values as in the prior art example a slight speed increase is necessary to make the design function, i.e. to make Zbuf 100 . The intermediate storage unit can be of the same size as the display memory. However in the case of expensive memory components it can be reduced in size by having only enough capacity to allow for buffering of the area on the display where the information content is changing, i.e. in the direction corresponding to the radar sweep. This can be accomplished by segmenting the refresh memory into N1 N1 blocks of locations each block then containing U U pixels, N where U NN It can be demonstrated geometrically that the number of such blocks addressed by the radar sweep at any bearing will be upwardly limited to 2 N1 blocks. The minimum capacity requirements for the intermediate storage unit is 2 N1 N1 blocks plus at least N1 blocks to allow reasonable time for data transfer to the refresh memory. In summary, the present invention relates to a method of treating range and direction information data which is converted from a first scan format to a different scan format and is displayed on a raster scan display, wherein the range and direction information data provided by a range and direction sensor is stored in an input buffer as quantized video signals at addresses corresponding to the first format according to which the field of view determined by the sensor in azimuth and range coordinates is scanned at a given first rate, and addresses are generated as a function of the scan pattern and the scanning rate to accommodate the data read from the input buffer in a memory unit at locations corresponding to the display line pattern to be realized on the raster scan display, the data stored in the memory unit being transferred to a video output unit under the control of a timing unit in order to be presented on the raster scan display at a given second rate, and the invention is characterized in that the storing of the data having converted addresses takes place in an intermediate storage unit consisting of a number of square memory blocks each corresponding to a plurality of pixels, that the intermediately stored data in the said blocks is transferred to a display memory, which comprises at least a sensor information refresh memory, after a writing sweep has passed respective memory blocks, and that in the said transfer of data to the display memory a plurality of pixels are transferred in parallel. Depending on the number of square memory blocks in the intermediate storage unit the filling and emptying of the blocks can be carried out in several different ways. The number of blocks in the intermediate storage unit does not have to be larger than that required when a writing sweep beam is made to sweep across a storage region representing the scanning area so as to simultaneously cover said number of blocks and a number of pixels associated therewith and the pixels which are thus covered by the writing sweep beam are filled with dats representing raw range and direction video information, since the blocks can be arranged to displaceably overlap the writing sweep beam through its scanning operation so that those blocks which are in the process of being filled are held stationary relative to the writing sweep beam whereas the blocks which have been passee tby the writing sweep beam are emptied and displaced to a position ahead of the writing sweep beam so as to maintain the overlapping thereof. Alternatively the number of blocks can be large enough to cover all writing positions of the writing sweep beam, in which case the dynamic overlapping of the writing sweep beam can be reduced to very few blocks or be completely eliminated. The preferred implementation of the conversion from polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates is based on the sensor direction and range vector value being represented by a constant frequency and its X and Y components being generated as fractions Ïf this frequency, the fractions representing the corresponding sine and cosine values respectively, which are found in a readonly memory table. Rate multipliers can be used to generate the X and Y components. In the preferred implementation the three frequencies are supplied to respective counters, the vector counter pointing to addresses in a sweep memory whereas the X counter and Y counter point to addresses in a block pointer memory and a block memory of the intermediate storage unit.The writing sweep is established in operation by the sweep memory, the X and Y counters, and the blockrp0inemory. After the converted data has been stored in the block memory it is transferred to the display memory in such a manner that the cartesian coordinates which have now been associated with the information, constitute the address at which the converted data is stored in the sensor information refresh memory of the display memory. In order to speed up the transfer of data from the display memory to the di5playt sensor information data representing a picture line of the raster scan display of a monitor on which this data is to be displayed is transferred to a line buffer during the line flyback period of the monitor. The picture line data is then ready to be transferred to the monitor during the total active horizontal line time and the pixels for the actual line are then shifted from the line buffer to the monitor, the sensor information refresh memory during this horizontal line being enabled for external input of fresh data which is to be displayed on the monitor. Although the line flyback time is relatively short compared to the total active horizontal line time, the transfer of a set of picture line data from a refresh memory to a line buffer will not constitute a problem since the amount of data representing only one picture line is relatively small. The transfer of the line data from the line buffer to the monitor takes place during the horizontal line time which is muchlOnger than the line flyback time. The horizontal line timeisalso utilized for updating the refresh memory with fresh converted video data from the block memory of the intermediate storage unit. To further speed up the transfer of data from the refresh memory to the line buffer the data is transferred in groups, each group being selected so as to have the same row address. Thereby the access time to each address location is reduced by reading in page mode and the retrieval and transfer time is speeded up so as to cope with the lineflyback period of the monitor. In the following the invention will be further described with reference to the drawingswhich illustrate the general principle of the invention and functional details related thereto.

Fig. 16 illustrates the position of pixels on the raster scan display of the monitor of figure 12. In Eig. 1. the function of a scan converter 1 is to transform picture data which has a specific scan format, namely polar coordinates related to a radar sensor, and a first data rateinto picture data of identical content, but having a different scan format, namely cartesian coordinates,and a second data rate, which is more convenient for the operator and which is to be displayed on a high resolution raster scan monitor 4.The scan converter 1, which forms a first part of the system illustrated in Fig. 1, converts radar data video, sync and angular direction of the antenna to X, Y coordinates in a coordinate converter unit 2, the converted radar information being stored in a radar display refresh memory 3 for appropriate display on the high resolution raster scan monitor 4 with a refresh rate of up to 60 Hz, the data stored in the radar display refresh memory 3 being transferred to the monitor 4 via a digital to analog converter and monitor sync generator 5. Another part of the system illustrated inFig. 1 is a synthetic part 6 containing several synthetic refresh memories 6a, 6b, 6c, the contents thereof being displayed on the monitor 4 and overlaying the radar picture. The synthetic refresh memories are controlled from a bus system 7, to which a vector andASCII code generator 8 is connected.It is to be understood that the converted radar signals which are disp layed on the monitor 4 can have their intensity and or gray scale varied according to the settings made by the operator, and it is also to be understood that the operator or a control function may select between different modes of operation, for example the display of radar data only or the display of radar data onte which are superposed synthetic display functions such as continuous vectors, broken vectors, vector contours and broken vector contours etc, provided by the synthetic part 6 of the display system.Vectors and characters can be generated in different synthetic picture memories for different colours and properties and the operator can also select various ranges of gain, range ring intensity, radar video on off, clutter controls, off centering inX and Y direction, range scale selection and afterglow selection. In Fig. 2 all the modules employed in the scan conversion process of the scan converter area indicated, i.e. all the modules used in the process in which radar information is converted from polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates or X Y coordinates . It wlll be seen from figure 2 that the coordinate converter unit 2 of figure 1 comprises four in out modules,ntmelv a radar input module 9, an antenna input module 10, a video converter input 11, a video converter output 12 and a display processor module 13. The radar input module 9 carries out a single conditioning of the signal in which the signal level is adapted in relation to the signal to noise ratio.The antenna input module 10 is substantially concerned with the conversion of the synchronised antenna signal into digital bearing in absolute angular format. These modules are connected in a direct or indirect manner to the radar display refresh memory 3, which in Fig.2 is indicated by the block 14. The coordinate converted radar picture is stored in the refresh memory 3 prior to being displayed on the raster scan monitor 4. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the analog video signal which is supplied by a radar antenna to an analog to digital converter 15 is converted therein to a 3 bit digital signal and thereafter stored in a sweep memory 16. From the sweep memory 16 the digital video information is transferred to a block memory 17, which is buffer storage provided by an intermediate storage unit and will be further described below. During the transfer of the digital video information from the sweep memory 16 to the block memory 17 conversion from polar to cartesian coordinates is carried out the conversion being realized by the use of rate multipliers in a unit 18, which receive direction signals from the antenna via a synchro digital S D converter 19 which converts the raw antenna bearing signal into digital signals.For example, three phase synchro phase information constituting the raw antenna bearing signal is converted thereby into twelve bit parallel information Signals from this latter converter 19 are also supplied to a central processing unit 20, which controls the block memory 17 for the transfer of the cartesian data stored therein to a radar memory 21, so as to transfer the block memory data to the radar display memory addresses corresponding to the cartesian coordinates associated with said radar data and also coinciding with the raster format of the monitor 4. Fig. 3 illustrates the arrangement of the radar display memory 21, the radar display memory being arranged in 64 x 64 blocks, each block having 16 x 16 pixels or picture points. This gives a total of approximately one million picture points. In Fig. 5 there is illustrated the arrangement of the block memory 17. It is a block structure similar to the radar memory illustrated in Fig.4, but has only 256 blocks in total. With 16 x 16 pixels in each block of the block memory 17 this gives a total of approximately 65000 pixel points which can be filled or emptied in the block memory 17. Fig. 6 illustrates the build up of the sweep memory 16 indicating 1024 range cells. At 0.75, 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 nautical miles this range cell represents a dis tance of 6.25 2, 6.25, 12.6, 50,100 and 200 meters respectively, for an off centred picture. From Fig 7 which illustrates the connection between polar or vector coordinates and cartesian coordinate, it is seen that any point along a radar scan vectorR may be represented in the XY plane by a pair ofX and Y values.fn the conversion process the vector R is generated as a constant frequency, and its componentsX R sin and YeR COS , are generated by the use of rate multipliers as indicated in Fig. 8. Here, the frequency representing R is supplied to a first rate multiplier 25 and a second rate multiplier 26, the first rate multiplier 25 having as a second input a sin value which may be fetched from a look up table in a read only memoryROM shown in figure 11 which is part of the S D converter 19.Thus, the output from the rate multiplier 25 will be the cartesian value X R sin , which is a frequency different from the input frequency representinq the scan vector the output depending on the value of sin supplied from the look up table. This frequency signal is supplied to an X counter 27 as illustrated in Fig. 9, which converts the frequency signal to a digital counter value pointing to the associated address in the block memory 17a and an associated block pointer memory 2 . The second input to the rate multiplier 26 is the cos value obtained as the complement of the sine value from the ROM. Its output i.e. the frequency valueY R cos , is in a similar manner supplied to Y counter 28, which converts the frequency signal into a digital signal pointing to the associated address in the block memory 17a and the block pointer memory 29 as will be further discussed in connection with Fig. 10. As illustrated in Fig. 9, signals are transferred from the X counter 27 and the Y counter 28 to the block pointer memory 29 , which during coordinate conversion presents pointers to the block memory 17a. Such pointers are also generated when blocks are transferred to the radar display memory 21, and in this case the addresses to block pointer memory are generated in the CPU 20 as illustrated in Fig 3. The frequency representing the fundamental vectorR is supplied to an R couter 29 which points to addresses in the sweep memory 16a, which is also represented at 16 in Fig. 3. As disclosed above, the block memory 17 which has previously been indicated in Fig. 3 and Fig 5. comprises 256 block elements each of which are divided into 16x16 pixels, thereby making a total of 65 536 pixel positions. Each of these pixel points can store a 3 bit information giving a total of 196,608 bits to be stored in the block memory 17. In Fig. 10 it is schematically illustrated how the various blocks in the block memory 17 are arranged in relation to the writing sweep beam which represents the digitized radar video signals which are intermittently stored in the sweep memory 16 illustrated at 16b in Fig.10. The block memory 17 is addressed in such a way that the sweep memory scanning area is always covered by some or all of the memory blocks included in the block memory 17. In Fig. 10 there is illustrated an example of a writing sweep beam 16b generated by the sweep memory 16, which passes through four blocks, namely blocks B1 B6 in the block memory 17b. It is seen that video at position A in the writing sweepZbeam 16b is written into block B2, pixel 10 3 in the X, Y plane.It is also seen that the sweep beam has a notional bearing going through block B4, block B5, block B2 and block B3, the notional bearing corresponding to the actual bearing of the radar antenna. At a bearing 521 t , the writing sweep beam would scan through other blocks and pixels. This notional scanning by the writing sweep beam is in fact effected by the manner in which the block memory 17 is addressed as data is written from the sweep memory 16 to the block memory 17 as will be explained in more detail herein after.In Fig. 10 the writing sweep beam 16b has already scanned through block Bl and this block has therefore been filled with the necessary video datain converted scan fbrmat,and is now ready to be emptied, i.e. the information thereof transferred to the radar memory 21, see Fig. 3. When the writing sweep beam moves further it will come into the area covered by block B6, and block B6 must therefore be an empty block. If all the 256 blocks in the block memory are considered, it is seen that some blocks are empty, some occupied by the writing sweep beam, some being emptied and some being filled. It should also be noted that at start up the pointer memory 29 is initialized with the correct pointers. As explained above the block memory pixel locations which are covered by the writing sweep beam are filled with data representing raw radar video information in accordance with the cartesian coordinates associated therewith, and the memory blocks containing the pixel locations which are to be filled with information are so arranged as to be displaceably overlapped by the sweep beam through its scanning operation. In other words, the blocks which are in the process of being filled are maintained with an address corresponding to the actual antenna bearing interval, which makes these blocks stationary relative to the writing sweep beam whilst being covered by the same, whereas the blocks which have been passed by the writing sweep beam and are emptied, are displaced i.e. given another address so as to be positioned ahead of the writing sweep beam for thereby maintaining the overlapping thereof. This overlapping of the blocks on the writing sweep beam is accomplished by the central processing unit 20 indicated in Fig.3, the processing unit 20 receiving bearing information from the antenna. This bearing information settles the address of each memory block, so as to correspond to a bearing interval in which the memory blocks are covered by the writing sweep beam.When the writing sweep beam has passed a memory block, which by then has been filled with appropriate data, the said data is transferred to the radar display memory 21 and the address of the emptied memory block is changed so that this block assumes a ready position in order to be covered again by the advancing writing sweep beam. The total number of pixels per complete rotation of the radar beam is 4.096.000, the radar pulse repetition rate being 2000 per second. Since the beam rotates in small steps, some elementary areas scanned are irradiated several times during one complete rotation of the beam.All the raw digitized pixels are stored in the block memory 17, but only the final i.e. last pixel data which appears after the beam has passed any particular elementary area is transferred to the radar display refresh memory 3. The passing of the beam is monitored by an algorithm.Thus there are 4.096.000 writing accesses to the blockmemory 17, but only 1045876 final pixels are transferred to the refresh memory 3. No updating of the same pixel is effected in the refresh memory 3, and the 1045876 pixel locations of the refresh memory 3 correspond to the pixel points of the raster scan display on the monitor 4.In accordance with the algorithm, for every antenna bearing there exists a series of addresses of memory blocks which have been passed by the writing sweep beam 16b. The algorithm also tests the angle and position of the extreme points of every memory block, so as to determine which blocks have been passed and are ready to be read to the refresh memory 3. At start up the central processing unit 20 reads off console buttons for sweep centre, range afterglow intensity etc. This information is transferred to the in out modules 9 to 13 at initialization. The CPU 20 will, as mentioned above, also generate a table in theCPU memory, which includes all memory block addresses and the corresponding antenna bearings. This table is regenerated every time the sweep centre is moved.In operation the CPU 20 receives an interrupt every ms.When the interrupt is received the CPU 20 reads off the antenna bearing. The block addresses to all blocks which the scan has passed are now output to the video converter output module 12. These addresses are used for transfer of block data from the block memory 17 to the radar display memory 21. In Fig. 11 there is shown a more detailed block diagram of the video converter input module 11 indicated previously in Fig. 2. This module 11 has inter alia circuits for A D conversion, interference filter, video sample memory, sine cosine circuits and XY rate multipliers. Necessary circuits for range rings, sample select, sync filters and controls are also included.The A D converter is used to digitize the video signal into eight levels 3 bits , the gain of the converter being a combination of sweep gain and preset gain, and the sample frequency being preferably 24 MHz. The sampling frequency is dependent upon range scale setting, and this is accomplished by adjusting the input sample select circuit. Details of the blocks 19 and 18 of Fig.3 are shown in Fig.ll between the legends ANT. SIGNALS andX CONTROL and Y CONTROL. At the beginning of every radar sweep, the bearing information ss is latched and used as input to a sineROM. From the bearing data a sine value is obtained and from the complement thereof a cosine value is obtained.Both values are stored. The two most significant bits of the bearing data are decoded for quadrant information.These functions are accomplished by the sine cosine circuits indicated in Fig. 11. The XY rate multipliers 25 and 26 which have been discussed above, are used to generate the X and Yfrequencies for coordinate conversion. The sine of the bearing value determines X frequency in quadrants 1 and 3 and Y frequency in quadrants 2 and 4, whereas the cosine of bearing value determines X frequency in quadrants 2 and 4 and Y frequency in quadrants I and 3. Both frequencies vary between 0 and 2 MHz. Since maximum read frequency in sample memories is preferably 4MHz and maximum XY frequencies are 2MHz, it is sometimes during conversion necessary to combine two video cells, i.e. select the biggest of two video values. This is done in the output sample circuit. The sync filter circuit has two sync filters, one filter being preset to enable a converter sync every 0.5 ms, and the other being preset to enable a CPU sync sync interrupt every ms. This means that the converter will skip all sync exceeding 2 KHz. The enabled sync is synchronized to a 24 MHz clock for data acquisition and to 12 MHz for sine, cosine generation and conversion. The module 11 has also circuits for range selection and interface to latch data from a selected bus plane. The basic timing of the above described system is obtained from the synchronization of the monitor 4.Information contained in the different refresh memories of which one is the radar display refresh memory 3, has to be transferred by the video output unit 5 to the monitor 4 according to what the monitor raster position is at the moment. In this connection reference is made particularly to Fig. 12 and Fig 13, Fig. 12 being a block diagram illustrating the data flow from the coordinate converter unit 2 through the refresh memories 3, 6a 6c and via auxiliary buffers to the monitor 4, and Fig 13 illustrating the monitor timing. In Fig. 13 the following designations indicated therein represent tha total active horizontal line time thb horizontal blanking time tvb vertical blanking time. During the time interval tha which represents the total active horizontal line time, pixels for the actual line are shifted from a line buffer 30, 60a, 60b, 60c to the monitor 4 see Fig. 12. At the same time the refresh memories 3 and 6a, b and c are ready for external inputs of display data. During the time interval thb which represents the horizontal blanking time, all pixels up to 1024 for the next line are loaded from the refresh memories to the respective line buffers. During the time when the line buffers are being loaded, the refresh memories go busy for external inputs. In other words the radar data representing a picture line of the monitor, on which the converted radar data is to be displayed, is transferred to a line buffer during the horizontal blanking time or flyback period of the monitor 4, and this flyback period is very short compared to the total active horizontal line time. The use of a line buffer after the refresh memory allows a rapid transfer of line data during this period because the line data only represents a small quantity of the information stored in the refresh memory. For further speeding up of the transfer of data from the refresh memory to the line buffer the data is transferred in groups, each group being selected so as to have the same row address thereby reducing the access time to each address location by reading the data in page mode and speeding up retrieval and transfer time during the flyback period. Page mode reading can be carried out by using for example Intel Memory 2118 elements. A selection and timing means for accomplishing the above described transfer of data between the refresh memories and line buffers is indicated by block 31 inscribed REFRESH TIMING in Fig. 12. A detailed timing diagram is illustrated inFig. 14a and 14b. The principle of the page mode operation can be seen for example from the second group of timing diagrams in Figures 14a and 14b, in whichRADO RAD17 represent address information, R RAS L represent Row Address Control Signal Low , RERAS H represent Enable Row address High , R CAS 11 representColumn Address Signal Low , EDO L represent EnableData out Low and RWE 11 represent Write Enable L . As seen from these diagrams the signal RERAS H shifts only once during a line buffer period, whereasRCAS L shifts 16 times during the same period. Fig. 15 is a schematic diagram illustrating the pixel positions in the refresh memory, and Fig. 16 illustrates the position of the pixels on the monitor. It is to be noted that when the pixels are transferred to the radar display refresh memory they will be stored at locations which correspond to similar location in the pixel position of the monitor. This facilitates the transfer of monitor line data from the refresh memory to the line buffer and thence to the monitor via the video output unit illustrated inFig. 2. With regard to the operations of transfer of data from the sweep memory 16 through the block memory 17 to the radar display refresh memory 3, it should be noted that these operations are performed entirely under the.control of the central processor unit 20 and constitute two,software implemented tasks. In the first of these tasks, which of the blocks of 16 x 16 pixels have just been passed by the radar antenna beam for each of the 4096 possible values of antenna bearing , the S D converter 19 providing 12 bit resolution, is calculated geometrically according to the position of the sweep center of the radar on the display. The results of this calculation are stored sequentially in a data table, each antenna bearing with the associated block addresses. Each block in the display is listed once in this table, corresponding to one transfer per antenna rotation.The manner in which the limited number of physical memory blocks in the block memory 17 is to be utilized in each antenna rotation is planned, so that the block memory 17 can cover the whole display by using each physical memory block several times.The result of this computation is stored in the block pointer memory 29. In the second of the two tasks, the central processor 20 reads the antenna bearing every millisecond and, from a simple look up in the table of bearings with associated block addresses mentioned above, initiates the transferring of the correct data block or blocks. It should be noted that the number of transfers to be initiated will vary from 0 to a maximum of 64. Each block, as mentioned before, holds 16 x 16 pixels. The transferring of a single block is effected by a continuous sequence of transfer cycles, 4 pixels at a time, giving 64 cycles as the total for one block. The following physical connections are used for the transfer from the block memory 17 to the radar display refresh memory 3 twelve data lines to transfer d pixels of 3 bits eighteen address lines to address one 4 pixel group out of 262144 and five control lines. The control circuitry for the control operation is part of the physical equipment implementing the block memory 17.
