# Environment monitoring system.

## Abstract
An environment quality monitoring system for detecting sublethal degradations in environmental quality. The system continuously or perodically monitors the movements of a plurality of living organisms 13 which are exposed to an environment 14 from one or more selected sources. A computer 18 controls and coordinates the tasks performed by the system. A video camera 16 is used to visually monitor the movements of the organisms 13 . Sensors 17 measure selected characteristics of the organisms environment 14 , including the temperature. The computer 18 , includes software, responsive to the measurements by the sensors 17 , for deriving a set of prediction parameters corresponding to the statistical distribution of expected movement patterns of the organisms 13 . Other software is used for analyzing the organisms movements and for comparing the observed movements with the set of prediction parameters, and for initiating the generation of a warning message when the organisms observed movements do not correspond to the prediction parameters.
