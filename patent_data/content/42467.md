# Tandem solar cell.

## Abstract
A high efficiency tandem solar cell is fabricated by evaporating a layer 2 of optically transparent conducting material, such as indium tin oxide, on a substrate layer 1 of crystalline silicon to form a photo responsive p n junction 3 . A layer 4 of amorphous silicon is plasma deposited on the layer 2 and is n doped in the region 5 in contact with the layer 2 . A thin film 8 of optically transparent metal is evaporated on the layer 4 to form a photo responsive Schottky barrier 9 . A layer 12 of anti reflective material, such as TiOâ‚‚, is applied to the film 8 . Light incident on the upper surface 13 has higher energy photons absorbed in the higher bandgap amorphous material layer 4 and lower energy photons pass through the transparent conductor layer 2 to a point of absorption in the lower energy gap crystalline material layer 1 .
