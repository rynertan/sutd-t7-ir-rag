# Method and apparatus for laying down tapes.

## Abstract
An advancing, reinforced, thermoplastic tape is pressed on a partially built, composite structure as the mating surfaces are heated to the melting point by a beam of high temperature, radiant energy. The center of the beam is directed at the structure, in advance of the nip between the tape and structure.
