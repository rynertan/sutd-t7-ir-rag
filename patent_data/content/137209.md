# SILICON WAFER AND ITS APPLICATION IN PRODUCING INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DEVICES

## Abstract
The semiconductor silicon wafer contains a small amount of oxygen and has a carbon concentration of greater than about 4 ppm. Wafers of said kind are provided by slicing the tail part of a melt grown silicon crystal into wafers and subsequently selecting from the produced wafers those having a carbon concentration of greater than 4 ppm. These wafers are applied for producing integrated circuit devices by means of essentially known manufacturing procedures. The formed integrated circuit devices have a low device leakage current.
