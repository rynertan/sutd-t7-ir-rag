# MISREGISTRATION DISTORTION CORRECTION SCHEME

## Abstract
In a registration system for compensating for distortion of a test printed circuit board 12 relative to a stored reference in a printed circuit board inspection system fiducial marks on the test board are compared with fiducial marks on the stored reference to determine distortion of the test board with respect to the reference board. This information is utilized to load a memory 18d so that exposure EXP pulses for a scanning CCD camera 11 can be read out at intervals which com pensate for distortion in the scanning direction x. The fiducial information is also used to generate a pixel gate on the oc currence of each exposure EXP pulse to compensate for distortion in the y direction. The exposure EXP pulses are further utilized to generate addresses to a buffer memory 19 storing the reference to cause patches representative of the reference board to be read out of memory in registration with patches representative of the couterpart surface location of the test board 12 to permit accurate real time comparison of the test board 12 with the stored reference.
