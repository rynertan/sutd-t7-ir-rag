# IMPROVED TRIESTER PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF OLIGONUCLEOTIDES

## Abstract
Oligonucleotides of a defined sequence, particularly oligodeoxyribonucleotides are prepared by an improved triester process. The oligodeoxyribonucleotides can be converted to DNA segments which can be used for insertion in plasmid DNA to code the plasmid DNA for predetermined purposes. For example, the plasmid DNA can be coded to stimulate the synthesis of polypeptide hormones by a bacterium such as E. Coli.
