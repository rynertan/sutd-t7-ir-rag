# Print wire solenoid.

## Abstract
A print wire solenoid for high speed operation is made with two major components or subassemblies. The first is a plastic injected unitary bobbin or stator assembly 15 which incorporates a core ring and a core 20 , and a stator 30 which forms a bobbin for receiving an electric coil 80 . The parts in the stator are positioned and molded to a datum surface 38 . The second major subcomponent is a unitary armature assembly 40 which incorporates an armature 41 , a retraction spring 55 , and a print wire 14 , all anchored to a plastic body 50 . These parts are likewise positioned with respect to a datum surface 60 . The stator assembly and armature assembly are retained within a drawn metal case 11 , and a rebound disc 70 is positioned within the case and locates the datum surface 60 of the armature assembly in the same plane as the datum surface 38 of the stator assembly so as to define an accurate working air gap 78 .
