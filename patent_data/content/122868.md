# A MULTIPLE DISK REFINER FOR REFINING LOW CONSISTENCY PAPERMAKING STOCK

## Abstract
A refiner 5 comprising a housing 10 having a refining chamber 11 providing a flow path for particulate material to be refined while traveling between an upstream inlet 12 and a downstream outlet 13 . A refining assembly 15 in the chamber 11 has a series of relatively rotatably cooperative axially confronting annular refining surfaces 18 19 located on partially internested refining disks 21 22 and defining radially extending refining zones 20 therebetween and with radially opposite ends of the zones closed. Passages 53 defined by and between the internested portions of the disks connect the adjacent refining zones in a manner to cause the particulate material such as paper making stock to pass suc cessively between the radially outer ends of the zones and the radially inner ends of the zones.
