# DIAPHRAGM TYPE PUMP DEVICE

## Abstract
A diaphragm type pumpe device comprises a connect ing rod 1 , a diaphragm 2 connected to an end of the connecting rod, a cover 13 which firmly secures the outer circumferential part of the diaphragm and constitutes a first operation chamber 14 , a frame 19 which opposes the cover to firmly secure the outer circumferential part of the diaphragm 2 in association with the cover 13 and constitutes a second operation chamber 20 , and an intake port 15 21 and a discharge port 16 22 which are respectively communicated with the first operation chamber 14 and the second operation chamber 20 and provided with check valves 17, 23 18, 24 each having different communicating direction, wherein the first and second operation chambers 14 20 alternatively perform pumping operation by the amplitude movement of the diaphragm 2 due to a combination of the reciprocating movement of the connecting rod and the action of the check valves.
