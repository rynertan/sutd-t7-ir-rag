# FLUID MACHINE

## Abstract
A fluid machine comprises a cylinder block mounted on a rotary shaft, a rotary plate an axis of which is intersecting with an axis of the rotary shaft by an acute angle, a gear en gaging mechanism for engaging the rotary plate with the rotary shaft to cyclically rotate the same, a piston supported by the rotary plate and inserted into a throughhole provided in the cylinder block a suction system and a delivery system for effecting suction and delivery operation by a rotation of the cylinder block and the piston, a spherical contact portion disposed between the rotary plate and the rotary shaft and adapted to receive thrust generated between the same, and a passage for leading to the spherical contact portion a high pressure working gas including lubricating oil gen erated in the delivery system.
