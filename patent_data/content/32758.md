## Abstract
A method for the prevention of disturbances and or ef fects of disturbances in the preparation of hydrocarbon hy droperoxides by oxidation of hydrocarbons with molecular oxygen or a molecular oxygen containing gas at elevated tem perature by means of introduction of a basic substance into the reaction mixture when an uncontrolled temperature in crease occurs during the oxidation.
