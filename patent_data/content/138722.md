Additional floor mem bers 42 are connected to opposed parallel edges of the central section floor 14 which are parallel with the addition al roof members 40 , and each additional floor member 42 pivotally supports a side wall portion 16 . The end walls of the building are connected to the walls 46 of the central section 10 by a vertical pivot and can move so as to lie parallel with the walls of the central section or form end walls.
