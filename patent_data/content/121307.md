# Bracket for Venetian blind headrail.

## Abstract
A support bracket for a venetian blind headrail which is in the form of an open sided box structure including a top 14 , bottom 10 and a side 16 and or rear wall 12 and a separate front wall 18, 20 which is pivotal about a vertical axis with respect to the top and bottom walls, and which includes top and bottom flanges 22 . This pivoting is effected by a pivotal connection including a guide aperture 30 formed preferably in the top and bottom flanges, the aperture providing two guide surfaces 32, 34 angled with respect to one another, a hinge element 28 in the top and bottom walls engaging in each aperture, whereby the front wall can be pivoted between an open position and a closed position transverse to the open position. A latch 38, 40 is provided on the top and bottom flanges and on the top and bottom walls, the latch being spaced from the pivotal connection and prevents pivoting of the front wall away from the closed position. Unlatching is effected by moving the front wall 18, 20 , when in its closed position, away from the side wall 16 so that the hinge ele ment moves on one guide surface 32 to the junction of the guide surface and then the front wall can be pivoted to its open position, the hinge element then moving along the other guide surface 34 during the pivoting motion.
