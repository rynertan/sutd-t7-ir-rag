# Optical scanning system.

## Abstract
An optical scanning system includes a spinner 20 which carries a number of plane linear diffraction gratings 20a . A diode laser 16 provides a collimated beam of coherent light which is diffracted by the gratings 20 to form a scanning spot in an image plane 25 . A stationary diffraction grating 30 having the same properties as the spinner grating 20a is incorporated in the optical path in a plane parallel with the spinner to provide compensation for wavelength shifts in the coherent light from the laser.
