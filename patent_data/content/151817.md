## Description
This invention relates to a process for preparing an alpha arylalkanoic acid or salt thereof which comprises the rearrangement of an alpha chloro or bromo alkylarylketal in neutral or slightly alkaline conditions, in the presence of a dipolar aprotic diluent and of a protic substance having a high dielectric constant, and the subsequent hydrolysis of the thus obtained ester.The European Patent Application 34 871 describes a process for preparing esters of alpha arylalkanoic acids via rearrangemeSt.of alpha halo alkylarylketals in the presence of a Lewis acids the disadvantages of this process consist in the fact that the reaction must be carried out in an anhydrous medium and that the more effective Lewis acids are the salts of toxic heavy metals consequently there is a need for a careful purification whon the final product is intended for pharmaceutical use.Furthermore the Lewis acids incline to interact with the oxygen atoms of the ketal group and, consequently, to form by products whose amount ranges in accordance with the nature of the alpha halo alkylarylketal and of the Lewis acid which are used.The European latent Application No. 48 136 describes a process for preparing alpha arylalkanoic acids wherein an alpha sulfonyloxy ketal undergoes hydrolysis. This process lays on the prejudice that the halogen atom is not sufficiently labile to promote the rearrangement in the absence of a catalyst having affinity for halogen whereas it was well known that the sulfonyloxy groups, e.g. tosyloxy and mesyloxy, are sufficiently labile to dissociate from the substrate upon contact with a protic polar medium.Despite the apparent easy of the last step, this process is complex and cumbersome owing to the fact that at first an alpha halo ketone is reacted with an alkali metal alkoxide to afford an alpha hydroxyketal which is then treated with an o sulfonylating agent to form the corresponding alpha sulfonyloxyketal and finally the alpha sulfonyloxyketal is submitted to hydrolysis. The number of steps involved and the difficulties inherent in carrying out on a large scale some of the steps, leave roc for a more simple and economical process.Now it has been surprisingly found that alpha halo alkylarylketals undergo rearrangement in neutral or slightly alkaline conditions in the presence of a dipolar aprotic diluent and of a protic substance having a high dielectric constant thus avoiding the detour depicted in the European Patent Application 48 136 as well as disadvantages inherent in the process described in the EuropeanPatent Application 34 871.More particularly, the process according to this invention comprises the rearrangement of an alpha chloro or bromo alkylarylketal in neutral or slightly alkaline conditions, in the presence of a dipolar aprotic diluent and of a protic substance having a high dielectric constant, and the subsequent hydrolysis of the thus obtained ester.The process object of the invention may be represented by the following reactions EMI2.1 EMI2.2 wherein Ar is an aromatic radical selected from the group comprising a phenyl substituted by one or two substituents selected from the group comprising halo gen, 1 6 C alkyl, 1 4 C alkoxy, 2 4 C alkenyloxy, difluoromethoxy, phenyl, phenoxy, dichlorophenoxy, di chloroanilino, benzoyl, indolinyl, dihydropyrrolyl, thienoyl, b naphthyl substituted by one or two substituents selected from the group comprising halogen and 1 4 C alkoxy, c pyrrolyl substituted by one or two radicals selected from the group comprising 1 4 C alkyl and 1 4 C alkylphenyl, d chloro carbazolyl, e benzoxazolyl substituted by one chlorophenyl radical, f thiazolyl substituted by one or two radicals selected from the group comprising phenyl and chloro phenyl, and g thienyl, R1 and R2, independently from each other, are a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 12 C atoms, or when taken together are saturated or unsaturated straight or branched alkylene radical having from 2 to 12 C atoms, X is chlorine or bromine, R3 is hydrogen, alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or cycloalkyl having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, R4 is a unsaturated or unsaturated, straight or branched al kyl radical having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms which may be optionally substituted by a chlorine or bromine atom, a hydroxy or acetoxy group.Usually R4 is an alkyl when P and R are alkyls and is a 1 1 2 substituted alkyl when R and R2 together form an alkylene radical, the specific substituent of R depends on the components 4 of the reaction mixture. Specific examples of useful starting products ketals include the compounds of formula I wherein Ar is 4 methoxy phenyl, 4 isobutyl phenyl, 4 chloro phenyl, 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl R and R are 1 2 methyl or R1 and R2 together are CH2 CH2 , 2 2 2 CH2 C CH3 2 CH2 R3 is hydrogen or C C alkyl X is chlorine or bromine.The neutral or slightly alkaline condition is obtained by adding to the reaction mixture a buffer or a weak base either organic or inorganic or mixture thereof Examples of typical compounds are the aliphatic and the aromatic tertiary amines and the alkali and alkaline earth metal salts of organic and inorganic acids such as sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, potassium acetate, triethylamine, methylpiperidine, methyl pyrrolidine and dimethylaniline.The dipolar aprotic diluents useful in the process object of the invention include dimethylformamide, dimethylsulphoxide, hexamethylfosforotriamide, N methyl pyrrolidone, dimethylacetamide,N methyl morpholine, 0 alkylated polyglycols, sulpholane and mixtures thereof. The protic substances having a high dielectric constant if solid, when in solution useful in the process object of the invention include water, urea, thiourea, formamide, acetamide, benzamide, phenols, N methyl formamide, N methyl acetamide, N,N dimethyl urea and mixtures thereof. Formamide, due to its good solubilizing properties with respect to the ketals of formula I, does not need the presence of a dipolar aprotic diluent.The amount of dipolar aprotic diluent to be used depends on the relative solubility of the selected ketal. A complete solubility of the ketal in the reaction mixture is not an essential feature.In general an amount of dipolar aprotic diluent sufficient for dissolving about 10 by weight of the ketal is sufficient. Also the amount of the protic substance having a high dielectric constant is not a critical feature. With respect to the ketal, the protic substance may be used in catalytic amounts up to equimolecular amounts or in excess. With respect to the dipolar aprotic diluent, the amount of protic substance may vary in a wide range.For practical purposes the ration dipolar diluent protic substance is comprised between 100 1 and 1 1 by volume or by weight when one of the compounds is a solid , the preferred range being from 20 1 to 1 1. Higher amounts of the protic substance generally increase the reaction rate.The reaction temperature is comprised between BOOC and 2000C.The duration of the reaction depends on various features such as the reactivity of the selected ketal, its solubility in the reaction medium, the selected polar aprotic diluent and its amount, the selected protic substance having a high dielectric constant and its amount.Generally the reaction is complete in a period of time ranging from 30 minutes to 36 hours.At the end of the rearrangement reaction the mixture is worked up according to conventional methods to isolate the ester 11 thus obtained which is then subjected to hydrolysis according to conventional procedures thus affording the desired arylalkanoic acid III in high yields and with high purity.In a practical embodiment the process object of the invention is carried out by introducing in the reactor the ketal of formula I, an amount of dipolar aprotic diluent sufficient for dissolving at least partially the ketal, the protic substance having a high dielectric constant and an amount of a buffer or of a weak base sufficient to ensure a neutral or slightly alkaline pH.The reaction mixture is heated while stirring to a temperature comprised between 800C and 2000C. The course of the reaction is followed according to conventional methods e.g. TLC, GLC or Infra red spectroscopy .At the end of the rearrangement reaction, the mixture is poured into water.The ester II is separated by extraction and isolated.The hydrolysis of the ester is carried out according to conventional procedures, for example by acid hydrolysis or preferably by treatment with an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide to afford the corresponding carboxylic acid salt from which, by treatment with a strong mineral acid, the free acid is obtained.The ketals of formula I are known compounds or may be easily obtained by ketalization of the corresponding alpha haloalkyl aryl ketones.Examples of methods suitable for preparing alpha haloalkyl arylketals comprise the use of an acid catalyst such as p toluene sulphonic acid J.
