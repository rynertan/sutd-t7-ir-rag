# Improved coherent phase shift keyed demodulator for power line communication systems.

## Abstract
A coherent phase shift keyed demodulator 14 provides improved performance and simplified circuitry through the use of a reference vector signal generator 78 which employs an intermediate reference vector V2 generated from the phase 60, 62 of an incoming carrier signal which, under certain conditions, is reversed in phase prior to being combined with a previous value VR
