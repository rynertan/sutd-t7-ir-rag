## Description
The present invention relates to a polymerizable liquid composition on the basis of allylcarbonates,and to the conversion of said mixture into substitutes for optical glasses, having high optical and mechanical char acteristics. The invention relates also to the substi tutes for optical glasses thus obtained. In the field of the substitutes for optical glasses, the products of polymerization of glycols bis allylcarbon ates are interesting, such as, e.g., those disclosed in European Patent Appln. Publ. No. 35,304, and among these, the products from diethyleneglycol bis allylcarbonate polymerization are considerably interesting from the industrial viewpoint, and this in view of the optical and mechanical characteristics of such polymerizates. In particular, according to the prior art, mixtures of dieth yleneglycol bis allylcarbonate and of a free radical polymerization initiator are polymerized in glass moulds having a shape corresponding to the shape of the article which is to be manufactured, by operating by the casting technique. Such articles as flat sheets, ophthalmic lenses and safety lenses are thus produced. However, the use of diethyleneglycol bis allylcarbon ate shows some limitations in the application field of the replacement of optical glasses. For example, it is not much suitable to the production of high diopter lenses and of lenses having sharp curvature changes, such as Fresnel s lenses and lenticular lenses, and this because of its high shrinkage. Such a shrinkage causes the occurrence of stress phenomena which cause the sepa ration from the mould, and sometimes breakage phenomena. In particular applications of high commercial inter est, for example in the production of protecting shields, solar panels, lenses for hunters, and so forth, substi tutes for optical glasses having impact strength higher than that made possible by the polymerizates of diethyl eneglycol bis allylcarbonate are required. Thus, European Patent Application Publication Nr. 0114080 filed on July 25, 1984 a polymerizable liquid composition is disclosed, which is constituted by an oligomer of a bis allylcarbonate of a dihydroxy alcohol and by a mono mer of a bis allylcarbonate of a dihydroxy alcohol or of a tris allylcarbonate of a trihydroxyalcohol and or of an acrylic or vynil monomer. These compositions give rise to polymerizates suitable for use as substitutes for optical glasses, satisfactory both as regards the shrink age phenomena during the polymerization step, and the physical and mechanical characteristics of the same polym erizates. However, these liquid compositions have often visco sity values higher than about 300 centistokes at 25 C and such a characteristic thereof can create difficulties in their conversion into manufactured articles, during their processing by the casting technique. It resulted hence desirable to have available compo sitions of allylcarbonates liquid and sufficiently fluid under room conditions to overcome the processing difficuties previously briefly mentioned and polymerizable, under the usual polymerization conditions, with low shrinkage, in the production of substitutes for optical glasses having improved characteristics, in particular as regards the impact resistance. It has been found now that such a requirement can be fulfilled when the substitutes for the optical glasses are prepared by the casting technique, by starting from a polymerizable liquid allylcarbonate composition contain ing the composition containing furthermore at least one free radical initiator in an amount of from 1 to 6 by weight, relatively to the total of A , B and C components. The component A of the polymerizable liquid compo sition is a monomer of diethyleneglycol bis allylcarbon ate , definable by the formula This component can be prepared by the reaction be tween diallylcarbonate and diethyleneglycol in molar ratio to each other higher than about 10 1, operating in the presence of a basic catalyst,for example according to as disclosed in European Pat. Appln. publ. No. 35,304. Under these conditions, a reaction product consti tuted by at least about 80 90 by weight of compound I , the residual percentage being constituted by oligomers of diethyleneglycol bis allylcarbonate . Thus, the component A of the polymerizable liquid composition can be consti tuted by the compound I only,or by a mixture contain ing at least about 80 90 by weight of compound I , the residual percentage being constituted by its oligomers. In the preferred form of embodiment the component A is present in the polymerizable liquid composition in an amount of from 15 to 45 by weight. The component B of the polymerizable liquid compo sition is an oligomer or a mixture of oligomers of dieth yleneglycol bis allylcarbonate , definable by the formu la This component can be prepared by the reaction be tween diallylcarbonate and diethyleneglycol in molar ratio to each other of the order of about 2 1, operating in the presence of a basic catalyst, similarly to the preceding component A . Under these conditions, an essentially oligomeric reaction product corresponding to the above formula II is obtained, with an In the preferred form of embodiment, the component B is present in the polymerizable liquid composition in an amount of from 30 to 60 by weight. The component C of the polymerizable liquid compo sition is a monomer of tris hydroxyethyl isocyanurate tris allylcarbonate , definable by the formula This component can be prepared by the reaction be tween diallylcarbonate and tris hydroxyethyl isocyanurate in molar ratio to each other greater than about 10 1, operating in the presence of a basic catalyst, similarly to as for the preceding component A . Under these condi tions, a reaction product constituted by at least about 60 70 by weight of compound III is obtained, the residual percentage being constituted by oligomers of tris hydroxyethyl isocyanurate tris allylcarbonate . Thus, the component C of the polymerizable liquid composition can be constituted by the compound III only, or by a mixture containing at least about 60 70 by weight of compound III , the residual percentage being constituted by its oligomers. In the preferred form of embodiment the component C is present in the polymerizable liquid composition in an amount of from 10 to 45 by weight. The polymerizable liquid composition of the present invention contains moreover one or more polymerization initiators, soluble in the same composition, and able to generate free radicals within a temperature range of from about 30 to about 120 C. Non limiting Examples of such initiators are diiso propylperoxydicarbonate,dicyclohexylperoxydicarbonate, disec.butylperoxydicarbonate, dibenzoylperoxide and tert butylperbenzoate. In the preferred form of embodiment, the polymerization initiator is present in an amount of from 3 to 5,5 by weight, relatively to the total of the weights of components A , B and C . The polymerizable liquid composition on the present invention can additionally contain one or more conven tional additives, such as stabilizers, release agents, dyes, pigments, U.V. absorbers or I.R. absorbers and the like, however in an overall amount not greater than 1 by weight relatively to the total of the weights of compo nents A , B and C . The polymerizable liquid composition of the present invention has viscosity values generally lower than 250 centistokes 25 C and typically comprised within the range of from 50 to 200 centistokes 25 C .These visco sity values render the same composition particularly suitable to the processing by the casting technique, according to which the composition is poured into moulds of shape corresponding to the shape of the article which is to be manufactured, operating at a temperature lower than the decomposition temperature of the free radical initiator, and the composition is then polymerized inside the mould. In particular, said polymerization is carried out by heating the polymerizable liquid composition at a tempe rature of from 30 to 120 C. The corresponding polymeriza tion times vary within a range from about 3 to about 100 hours. In this polymerization, the volume shrinkage phe nomena are very limited, the shrinkage being in any cases lower than about 10 by volume. Thus, those stress pheno mena, which cause the separation of the polymerizate from the mould and the breakage of the same polymerizate are avoided. Furthermore, such polymerizates have a set of such optical and mechanical characteristics as to make them particularly useful as substitutes for optical glasses. Among the mechanical characteristics, the impact strength, which is in any case higher than 12 kg cm2, is particularly good. In the following experimental Examples, reported to only exemplifying and not limitative purpose, the follow ing components have been used for the polymerizable liq uid composition. The components A , B and 0 are mixed with each other in the proportions which are indicated hereunder, and to the mixture dicyclohexylperoxydicarbonate DCPD is then added in a constant amount of 5.2 by weight relatively to the total of the weights of A , B and C . The compositions thus obtained are poured, at room temperature 20 25 C , into moulds constituted by two glass sheets of dimensions of 20 20 cm, provided with a gasket of plastified polyvinylchloride of 3.2 mm in thick ness. The polymerization is carried out in oven with forced air circulation, at the temperature of 48 C for 72 hours. At the end the sheets are removed from the moulds and are maintained at 110 C during the following two hours, to the purpose of destroying the possibly unreact ed catalyst and releasing the stresses frozen during the polymerization step. The technological characteristics of the polymeri zates thus obtained are reported in the following Tables. In particular, the following characteristics have been determined refractive index n by Abbe refractometer ASTM D 542 Haze and transmittance in the visible band measured by using Hazegard XL 211 marketed by Gard ner Co. ASTM D 1003 Yellow Index YI , defined as Density, as determined by hydrostatic balance at the temperature of 20 C ASTM D 792 Volume shrinkage on polymerization, calculated by the following equation Rockwell Hardness M , as measured by Rockwell Duro meter ASTM D 785 Ultimate tensile strength and flexural elastic modu lus ASTM D 790 Abrasion strength,Taber method ASTM D 1044 modi fied , carried out by using a pair of cs 10F grind ing wheels and with a load of 500 g on both of them.
