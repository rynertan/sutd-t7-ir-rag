# APPARATUS FOR THE SELECTIVE COLLECTION OF LIQUID

## Abstract
An apparatus for selectively collecting silage ef fluent draining from a silo at a variable flow rate com prises a delivery conduit 12 extending at a small up ward angle into a housing 14 set into the ground. The housing contains two collecting vessels in the form of mutually parallel drainage channels 15, 16 . In dry weather conditions the flow rate of silage effluent exiting from the outlet 13 of the conduit is at a low level. In such conditions the effluent has insufficient velocity to detach itself from the outlet 13 and runs back under the conduit 12 to drop off into the rear channel 15 . In conditions of wet weather, however, the silage effluent is diluted with rainwater and exits from the outlet 13 at sufficient velocity to fall into the front channel 16 . The rear channel 15 is con nected via a pipe 17 to a slurry tank, whereas the front channel 16 is connected via a pipe 18 to any suitable drainage system.
