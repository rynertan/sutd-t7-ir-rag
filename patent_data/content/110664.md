# IMPROVED METHOD OF RENOVATING SEWERS

## Abstract
This invention relates to an improved method of relining a sewer especially a small diameter sewer with a plurality of lengths of pipe. From a control station remote from the sewer, pipes are moved up the sewer to the fixed lining. The pipe is then induc tively fusion welded to the lining and the annulus between the pipe and the sewer is selaed with grout. All these operations are controlled from the control station. Also provided by the invention is a method of accurately locating laterals in the sewer and cutting holes in the pipe and accurately aligning these holes with the lateral to accommo date the lateral. Also provided is a grouting pump for forming grout in situ in the sewer.
