# Process for the preparation of riboflavin.

## Abstract
Riboflavin is obtained directly from the culture in a high yield by cultivating a riboflavin producing microorganism in a medium using a lower C₁ to C₄ aliphatic compound, separating riboflavin contained in the culture in the form of heated aqueous solution from solid matters, and crystallizing riboflavin from the heated aqueous solution. Riboflavin is also prepared in a high yield by cultivating a riboflavin producing yeast belonging to the genus Saccharo myces which has purine requirements and or resistance to 3 amino 1,2,4 triazole in a medium and collecting riboflavin formed and accumulated in the medium. Moreover, riboflavin is prepared in a high yield even in the presence of iron ions by preliminarily cultivating in liquid a riboflavin producing yeast belonging to the genus Saccharomyces and then cultivating it in a riboflavin producing medium containing zinc ions.
