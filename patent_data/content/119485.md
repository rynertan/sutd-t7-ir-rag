# Fatigue alarm system and method for an automotive vehicle driver.

## Abstract
A fatigue alarm system and method for an automotive ve hicle driver is adapted to measure periods of time during which the vehicle is driven and to subtract therefrom periods of time during which the driver rests. The driver rest periods are distin guished from brief stops of the vehicle in order to accurately measure the adjusted period of driving time. In order to distin guish rest periods from brief traffic stops, the duration of vehi cle stops are measured and compared with a given value. When the vehicle stop periods are shorter than the given value, vehicle is judged to be stopped briefly, i.e. that the driver is not resting, and the measured driving period is incremented by the measured vehicle stop period. On the other hand, when the stop periods are longer than the given value, then, the driver is judged to be resting. In this case, the measured stop time is subtracted from the measured driving time after being adjust ed by a suitable proportionality factor. The result of measure ment is visually displayed by means 38 of a plurality of fatigue level indicator segments. The threshold levels at which each in dicator segment is activated or deactivated are adjusted in ac cordance with its current activation state in order to avoid hunt ing thereof.
