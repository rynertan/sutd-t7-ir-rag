# Silicone elastomers having thermally conductive properties.

## Abstract
Silicone elastomers having thermally conductive prop erties which comprise an organopolysiloxane having Si bonded aliphatically unsaturated groups, an organohy drogenpolysiloxane having Si bonded hydrogen atoms, a catalyst capable of promoting the addition of Si bonded hydrogen to Si bonded aliphatically unsaturated groups and from about 30 to 95 percent by weight of filler, based on the weight of the composition, of which at least 10 percent by weight of the filler is silicon nitride particles.
