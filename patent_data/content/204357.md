## Description
The invention relates to a polymer composition on the basis of a graft copolymer and a copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride. In many plastics applications where a good combination of impact resistance, processability, surface properties and resistance to deformation at higher temperatures is of the essence, use is made of a graft copolymer of a vinyl aromatic compound and acrylonitrile on a butadiene rubber ABS . ABS is applied, for instance, for the manu facture of housings of all kinds of electrical equipment, but also for the manufacture of certain auto parts. For some applications, however, there may be a problem in that the graft copolymer of styrene and acrylonitrile on a butadiene rubber, optionally mixed with a styrene acrylontril copolymer, is not sufficiently resistant to deformation at the temperatures at which it is applied. Certain household and or electrical appliances must be resistant to higher temperatures than those which ABS itself can resist. A solution to this problem has been found in the form of replacement of all or part of the styrene by α methylstyrene. This can be done both in the graft copolymer and in the copolymer with acrylonitrile, or in both. Polymer compositions based on such a replacement are extensively described in the prior art literature, e.g. in US 4,404,323. Full replacement of styrene by α methylstyrene, both in the graft copolymer and in the copolymer with acrylonitrile, is, however, not feasible. In the first place this has a strongly negative effect on the processability of the end product, but besides that there also are problems with respect to the preparation of the graft copolymer. The reactivity of α methylstyrene is considerably lower, so that full replacement of styrene by α methylstyrene may give rise to a substan tial capacity decrease during polymerization of the graft copolymer or copolymer. In practice this means that there are limits to replacement of styrene by α methylstyrene. All this, however, in its turn has as a consequence that there are limits to improvement of the dimensional stability under heat Vicat, HDT of the polymer composition. Even at the upper limit, the dimensional stability under heat of the polymer composition still is insufficient for a number of applications. The object of the invention is to provide a polymer com position having a resistance to deformation at elevated temperature that is improved compared with that of the known polymer compositions on the basis of α methylstyrene, without the productivity and or dimensional stability under heat of the polymer composition being sacrificed. The polymer composition according to the invention is charac terized in that it comprises 10 88 parts by weight of a graft copolymer of a vinyl aroma tic compound and acrylonitrile on a butadiene rubber. 10 60 parts by weight of a copolymer of α methylstyrene and acrylonitrile, and 2 30 parts by weight of a copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride with a maleic anhydride content of 20 32 wt. , the styrene maleic anhydride content being lower than the α methylstyrene acrylonitrile copolymer content of the polymer composition. Surprisingly, it has been found that application of the com bination of at least these three components in the polymer composition yields a good dimensional stability under heat in combination with good processability and good impact resistance. Moreover, it is found that the problems to be expected with respect to demixing, poor pro cessability and low impact strength are not encountered on limited replacement of the copolymer of α methylstyrene and acrylonitrile by the styrene maleic anhydride copolymer. In this context it is noted that US patent 3,642,949 disclo ses mixing of copolymers of styrene and maleic anhydride with ABS. Optionally, a small amount of copolymer may be added to the mixture obtained. From a list of products to be applied, it can be deduced that the copolymer of α methylstyrene and acrylonitrile is also among these. There is advantage in having the polymer composition according to the invention comprise 35 49 parts by weight of graft copolymer, 35 49 parts by weight of α methylstyrene acrylonitrile copolymer and 2 30 parts by weight of styrene maleic anhydride copo lymer. With this combination of components, an optimum balance between impact strength and dimensional stability under heat is obtained. An added advantage of the polymer composition according to the invention is that the overall production rate increases on account of the average polymerization time of the various components, which implies that a higher plant output is achieved. The graft copolymer applied in the polymer composition according to the invention consists of a graft copolymer of styrene and or α methylstyrene on a butadiene rubber, which graft copolymer is known per se. The rubber is preferably chosen from the group made up of polybutadiene, butadiene styrene rubber, butadiene acrylate rubber, butadiene acrylonitrile rubber and mixtures of two or more of these rubbers with one or more other rubbers. When use is made of mixtures of a butadiene rubber with one or more other rubbers, the butadiene rubber content must at least be 50 of the mixture. The graft copolymer can be prepared in the customary manner, e.g. by mass, solution or suspension polymerization. It is also possible to combine two or more of these polymerization methods to, e.g., mass solution polymerization, mass suspension polymerization or emulsion suspension polymerization. Polymerization is preferably effected in the presence of the customary substances, such as free radical donors, optionally in combination with a redox system, chain length regulators, stabilizers, suspending agents, emulsifiers, and the like. It is also possible to apply more than one graft copolymer in the polymer composition according to the invention. In particular, there may be advantage in application of two graft copolymers, which differ in their preparation method, for instance a graft copolymer prepared by mass polymerization and a graft copolymer prepared by emulsion polymerization. It may also be advantageous to apply two graft copolymers having a different rubber content, for instance a graft copolymer with a rubber content between 20 and 50 wt. on the one hand and a second graft copolymer, with a rubber content that is at least 5 wt. higher, on the other. The total rubber content of the graft copolymer component of the polymer composition preferably is between 20 and 80 wt. , more in particular between 20 and 50 wt. , since optimum results as regards impact strength are obtained within these limits. The rubber content of the total polymer composition preferably is between 10 and 35 wt. . The copolymer of α methylstyrene and acrylonitrile can be prepared in a customary manner, for instance by emulsion polymeriza tion, solution polymerization, mass polymerization or suspension polymerization. It is preferred not to apply suspension polymeriza tion, since this gives rise to either very long polymerization times or very complicated recipes. The copolymer of α methylstyrene and acrylonitrile may optionally contain a small amount of styrene, pre ferably not more than 5 10 wt. . In certain cases, the presence of styrene, though having an adverse effect on the dimensional stability under heat, may have a positive effect on the compatibility of the various components in the polymer composition. The copolymer of α methylstyrene and acrylonitrile therefore generally contains 50 80 parts by weight of α methylstyrene, 20 40 parts by weight of acrylo nitrile and 0 10 parts by weight of styrene. The copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride to be applied according to the invention has a maleic anhydride content of 20 32 wt. . The upper limit of 32 wt. is determined by the processability of the copolymer in the polymer composition, while the advantages of the polymer composition according to the invention are absent or all but absent at a maleic anhydride content below 20 wt. . The copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride can be prepared in the customary for the preparation of a statistical, non alternating copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride. A possible process is described in Hanson and Zimmerman, Ind. Chem. Eng. Vol. 49., No. 11, November 1957, pp. 1803 through 1807. However polymerization is effected, it is essential that it is done with proper stirring, since otherwise an alternating copo lymer of styrene and MA is obtained, possibly in combination with a styrene homopolymer. The copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride may contain 0.1 5 wt. other monomers such as acrylonitrile or methylmethacrylate. This, however, is not necessary. The polymer composition according to the invention may optionally also contain a minor amount, e.g. up to 20 wt. , of a copo lymer of styrene and acrylonitrile. In addition, the polymer com position according to the invention contains the customary additives, in an amount of at most 10 wt. , which additives include colourants, pigments, stabilizers, lubricants, fillers, mould release agents, plasticizers, antioxidants, etc. The polymer composition can be prepared by mixing in the melt of the various components. To this end, known batch or continuous mixers, such as a Banbury mixer, or a single or double screw extruder can be applied. It is, however, also possible to mix two or more of the components of the polymer composition in the liquid phase directly upon their leaving the reactor, which mixing process can optionally be carried out in the presence of a solvent. This yields a melt or solu tion of the polymer mixture, which can then be processed to solid material in the customary manner. By preference this is done by granu lation of the melt, optionally after solvent removal. The polymer composition according to the invention is highly suitable for the preparation of various objects, such as tubes, bottles, furniture, car dashboards, cabinets and housings for electro nic and domestic appliances, shoe heels, caravans, skis and surf boards. The invention will now be elucidated on the basis of the following examples, without being restricted hereto. On the basis of a graft copolymer of styrene and acrylo nitrile on polybutadiene, a copolymer of α methylstyrene and acrylo nitrile in a weight ratio of 70 30 and a copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride with different maleic anhydride contents, a series of polymer compositions was prepared, use being made of the same, custo mary additives for each of the polymer compositions. The results are presented in the following table. As is apparent from comparison of Examples 1 3 and Examples 4 5, use of a styrene maleic anhydride copolymer with a maleic anhydride content of less than 20 wt. does not yield any substantial improvement of the combination of dimensional stability under heat and impact resistance, whereas use of a copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride with a high maleic anhydride content does see Examples I II .
