## Description
ALKYLATION OF SULPONES Certain aryl sulfonyls are alkylated through use of a polar aprotic solvent, a strong base and alkylating agents. U.S. Patent No. 3,960,542, issued June 1, 1976, discloses, inter alia, novel substituted 2 sulfonyl pyridine 1 oxides useful as herbicides. A method of controlling weeds through use of such compounds is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,019,893, issued April 16, 1977. The disclosures of both of the aforementioned patents are herewith incorporated by reference herein. As taught in both of these patents, the subject compounds may be prepared via formation of intermediate thio compounds, i.e., substituted 2 thiopyridines, and the subsequent oxidation of same to substituted 2 sulfonyl pyridine 1 oxides. Alternatively, the 2 sulfonyl pyridine 1 oxide derivatives may be prepared from known compounds. See, for example, W. Walter et al., Liebig s Ann., 695, 77 1966 E.Shaw et al. J.A.C.S. 72, 4362 1050 A. R. Katritsky, f. Chem.Soc., 191 1957 and U.S. Patents Nows. 3,107,994 and 3,155,671.Parent 2 thiopyridine 1 oxides may be prepared by 1 the reaction of 2 chloropyridine 1 oxide with the appropriate mercaptan in the presence of an acid acceptor such as an alkaline earth hydroxide or 2 reaction of the sodium salt of 2 mercaptopyridine 1 oxide with a suitable halide preferentially, but not necessarily, of the benzyl type. Normally, compounds of the type here relevant may be alkylated through use of a very strong base such as, for example, sodium hydride or sodium amide. But these compounds are extremely reactive, result in the formation of troublesome by products such as hydrogen or ammonia, and must be employed only under very anhydrous conditions requiring, for example, use of an inert atmosphere. An object of the invention is to permit alkylation of substituted 2 sulfonyl pyridine 1 oxides while reducing or avoiding the problems associated with other means of alkylating such compounds. It has now been found that substituted 2 sulfonyl pyridine 1 oxides may be alkylated via an alkylating agent in a polar aprotic solvent and a strong base. More specifically, starting materials may be selected from the substituted 2 sulfonyl pyridine 1 oxides having the general formEMI2.1 wherein R may be 2, 2 dichiorocyclopropyl, 2, 2 dichloro 1 methylcyclopropyl, naphthyl, methylnaphthyl, monosubstituted phenyl wherein the substituent is in the ortho position and is selected from alkyl having 1 to 2 carbon atoms, halogen or nitro, or polysubstituted phenyl having from 2 to 5 substituents which may be the same or different and are selected from alkyl having 1 or 2 carbon atoms, halogen, nitro, methoxy, ethoxy and methylenedioxy.Of special interest are those substituted 2 sulfonyl pyridine 1 oxides wherein R is selected from the group consisting of phenyl, phenyl substituted with 1 or 2 methyl groups, monohalophenyl and 2 napthyl, especially 2 methylphenyl, 3 methylphenyl and 2,5 dimethylphenyl. A preferred starting material is 2 2,5 dimethylphenylmethylsulfonyl pyridine 1 oxide. Representative of alkylating agents useful in this invention are alkyl and substituted alkyl halides and sulfates. Particularly interesting alkyl and substituted alkyl halides include the methyl, benzyl and allyl halides and substituted methyl, benzyl and naphthyl halides, respectively. Preferred alkylating agents for use herein include methyl chloride, benzyl chloride, propargyl bromide, dimethyl sulfate, methyl iodide, ethyl bromide, 3 trifluoromethylbenzyl chloride, allyl chloride, vinyl sulfone, 1,3 dibromopropane, 1,6 dibromohexane and 2 chloromethylnapthalene, with methyl chloride, benzyl chloride, propargyl bromide and dimethyl sulfate being most preferred. Polar aprotic solvents particularly useful herein includeN , N dimethylformami d e, N , N dimethylacetamide and dimethylsulfoxide. Aprotic solvents of lesser polarity than the just named compounds, such as methylene chloride and acetonitrile, are also useful but result in drastically lower yields. Strong bases that can be used include the alkaline earth hydroxides, with sodium hydroxide being especially preferred. Alkylations according to the invention yield products having the general formEMI3.1 where R is as defined above and R may be alkyl or substituted alkyl. Preferably R is selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, benzyl and substituted methyl, benzyl and naphthyl such as 2 propenyl, 2 propynyl, 3 trifluoromethylbenzyl and 2 1 methylnaphthyl. Most preferably, R is selected from the group consisting of methyl, benzyl and 2 propynyl. As presently understood, the use of a polar aprotic solvent is essential to this process due to such solvent s enhancement of the basicity of the strong base used. Generally, the substituted 2 sulfonyl pyridine 1 oxide to be alkylated is admixed with a polar aprotic solvent, a strong base and an alkylating agent to yield the desired alkylated substituted 2 sulfonyl pyridine 1 oxide. Preferably, the substituted 2 sulfonyl pyridine 1 oxide to be alkylated is added to a solution comprising the solvent, strong base and alkylating agent. In carrying out alkylations according to the invention as shown in the following examples, the polar aprotic solvent used was lul, N dimethylformamide used without drying the strong base was freshly ground to a powder before use, with care being taken to avoid prolonged exposure to moisture reaction temperatures were maintained in the range of from about 10 C to 400C and the reaction time varied with the specific alkylating agent employed.

The reaction temperature was maintained at 100C for 10 minutes. The reaction mixture was then poured into 300 mL of rapidly stirred ice cold water to afford a flocculent white precipitate. This suspension was filtered, washed with water, and air dried to give 4.80 g of 2 1 2,5 dimethylphenyl ethylsulfonyl pyridine 1 oxide 91 pure by H NMR analysis . This represents a 91 recovery, with an overall yield of 81 .

The reaction temperature was maintained at 30 40 C over a period of 4 hours. The reaction mixture was then poured into 2 L of rapidly stirred ice cold water to afford a flocculent white precipitate.

The temperature reached 50 C within a few minutes and was immediately cooled and maintained at 300C for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was poured into 300 mL of rapidly stirred ice cold water to afford a flocculent precipitate, which was filtered off, washed with water and air dried to give 10 g crude product.Crystallization from ethanol gave 8.0 g 64 yield of pure 2 x 2,5 dimethylphenyl x propargyl methyl sulfonyl pyridine 1 oxide, m.p. 169 1700C.
