# Method of processing silver halide color photographic material.

## Abstract
In a process for the continuous treatment of silver halide color photographic light sensitive materials with supplying a replenisher to a developing bath, the amount of the replen isher is 900 m or less per mÂ² of the light sensitive materials, and the light sensitive materials contain a certain type of mercapto heterocyclic compounds. Constant results in finished development and lower fog are attained and fogging during storage of raw light sensitive materials is suppressed even when the amount of the replenisher is very small.
