# Controlled absorption pharmaceutical composition.

## Abstract
A sustained absorption propranolol containing pellet for oral administration comprises a core of propranolol or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and an organic acid embedded in a polymeric material in a multi layer arrange ment and an outer membrane which permits release of the propranolol at a controlled rate in an aqueous medium. The pellet has a dissolution rate in vitro in an aqueous medium, which when measured in a basket assembly according to U.S. Pharmacopoeia XX at 37 C and 75 r.p.m., is not more than 15 of the total propranol after 2 hours of measurement in a buffer solution at pH 7.5. Not more than 30 of the total propranolol is released after a total of 4 hours of measure ment and not more than 63 of the total propranolol is released after a total of 6 hours.
