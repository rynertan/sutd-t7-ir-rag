# Voltage and electric field measuring device using light.

## Abstract
A voltage and electric field measuring device using light, including a polariser 2 , an electro optic crystal 4 consisting of a material having an optical rotatory power, and an analyser 5 arranged in this order in the direction of advance of applied light. A quarter wave plate 3 is disposed between the polariser 2 and crystal 4 or between the crystal 4 and analyser 5 . The angle of orientation ψ of the analyser 5 , relative to the optical axis of the crystal 4 , is set to the product of ϑ and ℓ, where ϑ represents the optical rotatory power, with respect to the applied light, of the crystal 4 near a point at the centre of a range of varying temperatures at the installation environment, and ℓ represents the thickness of the crystal 4 measured in the direction of advance of light. The specified relation between ψ and ϑ.ℓ maximises the temperature stability of the device by ensuring that the sensitivity of the device is substantially independent of temperature.
