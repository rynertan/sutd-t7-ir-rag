# VEHICLE SUSPENSION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A motor vehicle suspension system comprises four hy dro pneumatic struts 1, 2, 3, 4 three of which 1, 2, 3 are pro vided with sensors 33, 34, 35 to detect variations in length of the struts. A control system 39 is responsive to the sensors 33, 34, 35 and operates valves 40, 41, 42 to add fluid to or remove fluid from struts 1, 2, 3 to maintain the length of these struts constant. The pressure within the fourth strut 4 is con trolled so that the proportion of the static roll torque caused by off centre loading of the vehicle which is reacted by the front and rear axles is the same as the proportion of the static weight of the vehicle which is reacted by the front and rear ax les respectively. Control of the pressure within the fourth strut 4 is accomplished by a control valve 14 having a valve spool which is subject to the pressures within the four struts 1, 2, 3, 4 .
