# Coating compositions based on epoxide adducts and polyurethane prepolymers.

## Abstract
A two component coating system comprises A a polyfunctional acid dimer acid , low base strength amine aniline , and high base strength amine cyclohexylamine adduct of a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol and B an organic urethane prepolymer derived from a diol reacted with a diisocyanate. The coating is particularly adapted for coating surfaces subject to high abrasion, e.g., railroad hopper cars.
