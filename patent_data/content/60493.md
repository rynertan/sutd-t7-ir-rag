# Apparatus for detecting cracked rice grain.

## Abstract
An apparatus for detecting cracked rice grains. The apparatus has conveyor means by which the rice grains to be examined are moved in at least one row extending in the direction to movement, a light transmitting window formed in the conveyor means and adapted to pass a coherent light beam of a width smaller than the diameter of the rice grain, a light source means adapted to apply the coherent light, light receiving means including light receiving elements adapted to detect the quantities of lights transmitted through the leading half part and trailing half part of the rice grain when the latter passes over the light transmitting window, and a circuit means adapted to measure and compare the quantities of light received by the light receiving means in comparison with predetermined reference threshold values.
