## Abstract
A reinforcing adhesive sheet 1 is described, comprising a thermosetting resin sheet shaped prepreg 2 with a reinforcing material 3 embedded therein, and a flattened tubular material 4 provided on one side of the prepreg 2 , said flattened tubular material 4 being capable of nearly recovering the original tubular form on heating and being narrower in width that the prepreg 2 . The prepreg 2 may be of the two layer structure comprising a first thermosetting resin composition layer E and a second thermosetting resin composition layer G .
