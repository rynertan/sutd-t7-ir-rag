# METHOD OF CONTROLLING PYROLYSIS TEMPERATURE

## Abstract
A method of controlling temperature during a pyrolysis reaction wherein the predominant pyrolysis reactions are endothermic. A fuel and oxidizer are combusted in a combustion zone to produce a hot gas stream at a super atmospheric pressure. The hot gas stream is then passed through a converging diverging nozzle to accelerate the hot gas stream to a velocity of at least about mach 2. The reactant to be pyrolyzed is injected into the supersonic hot gas stream to produce a reaction mixture flowing at supersonic velocity and initiate the endothermic pyrolysis reactions. Substantially immediately thereafter the velocity of the reaction mixture is reduced over a predetermined reaction time to convert the kinetic energy of the reaction mixture to thermal energy in an amount sufficient to substantially offset the endothermic reactions taking place while maintaining supersonic flow. At the end of the predertermined reaction time the velocity of the reaction mixture is reduced to subsonic flow and the reaction quenched. The present invention is particularly adapted to the pyrolysis of methane to produce acetylene and ethylene by contacting the methane with hot gases resulting from the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen.
