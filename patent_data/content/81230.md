## Abstract
Glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic resins composing glass fiber, a thermoplastic resin and a copolymer of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer and from about 1 to about 20 wt. of copolymerizable functional monomer exhibit a marked improvement in impact properties, heat distortion values and ductility.
