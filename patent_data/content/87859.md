# Thermal energy storage compositions.

## Abstract
Thermal energy storage compositions comprise a ther mal energy storage material, for instance an inorganic hydrate that can undergo a change of hydration with accompanying release or storage of latent heat of hydration at a temperature of 10 to 100 C, held in a matrix of polymeric material, generally acrylic polymer. In one aspect of the invention the composition is in particulate form and so can, for instance, be poured into the heat exchanger in which it is to be used. In another aspect of the invention the storage material includes polyvalent metal ions and the polymeric material is a cationic polymer. In another aspect of the invention the composition is made by forming a solution, generally in water, of all the polymerisable material and most or all of the storage material and then polymerising the polymerisable material in this solution. The solution is generally a low viscosity fluid and polymerisation may be conducted in the heat exchanger vessel in which the composition is to be used.
