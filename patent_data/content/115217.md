# Method of forming corrosion protective coating layers.

## Abstract
A coating material for forming a corrosion protective layer on a metal surface or a defective area of a corrosion protective layer previously formed on the metal surface comprises a tape , sheet or chip like polymerizable coating material and a liquid material. Each material contains a vinyl monomer and or a vinyl group containing oligomer. One material contains a polymerization initiator and the other a polymerization accelerator. The liquid material is applied to the coating material and or the metal or defective surface and the surface then covered with the coating material which is swollen and softened by the liquid material permeating therethrough. Polymerisation occurs and a tough, adherent corrosion protective layer is formed.
