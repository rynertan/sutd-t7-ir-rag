# Reconversion device from a semi automatic operation system to a pump system and vice versa for fixed barrel sporting and defense guns.

## Abstract
A reconversion device permits a rapid conversion from a semi automatic operation system to a pump system and vice versa for fixed barrel sporting and defense guns without disassembling the gun. The reconversion device comprises an annular control handle 1 rotatably supported on a ring 2 secured to an end of a tubular cocking rod 3 axially slidable on a tubular magazine 5 and having two diametric ally opposite sectors 6 each ending in a tooth 7 which project from an end front face of the control handle 1 . By means of the teeth 7 of the two sectors 6 , the control handle 1 can alternatively be secured to or disengaged from the undercut groove 8 in the support 9 fixed to the barrel 10 . In semiautomatic operation corresponding to the secured mode, the inertial mass 25 of the breech bolt compresses spring 26 because of the recoil energy of the arm. In the disengaged mode, inertial mass 25 recoils with the arm spring 26 is not compressed and pump action is necessary for opening, cartridge ejection and returning to closed condition of the arm.
