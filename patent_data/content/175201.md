## Description
The present invention relates to a wheel slip control system for a vehicle operable to control the frictional force between the driven wheel tire and the road surface during a braking operation and during an accelerating operation as well, and particularly to a wheel slip control system which controls the rotation of the driven wheel using a brake hydraulic system. Prior Art There have been known so called anti skid brake systems for vehicles which control the rotation of the wheel so that an optimal braking force is produced without the occurrence of locked wheel during the braking operation. In these systems, the rotational speed of the wheel will be termed wheel speed hereinafter is controlled to amount slightly lower than the running speed of the vehicle will be termed vehicle speed hereinafter during the braking operation so as to maximize the frictional force between the wheel tire and the road surface. Defining a slip rate S as a function of the vehicle speed Vs and the wheel speed V as Various anti slip and anti skid wheel control systems have been developed and practically installed on vehicles for the security purpose of minimizing the stopping distance without a skid when the driver takes an abrupt braking action. Document DE A 31 27 302 discloses a system for controlling the propulsive drive applied to motor vehicle wheels, particularly having hydraulically operated disk brakes, in the sense of preventing undesired spinning of the driven wheels in order to obtain a desired vehicle behaviour in critical driving situations, especially under extreme road conditions. In the system, a comparator is provided which is triggered by at least one presettable or permanently preset threshold value corresponding to the speed of the vehicle, and which generates an output signal causing the drive torque to be reduced as soon as the threshold value is exceeded and a signal is present, which indicates that the individual wheel brake is being activated and or that one of the driven wheels is tending to spin. A control system comprises a first control loop which reacts to the state of motion of at least the driven vehicle wheels and which, when one of these wheels is tending to spin, activates its wheel brake, and comprises a second control loop applying a torque reducing control action to the drive unit of the vehicle when values preferably being determined from the wheel rotation speeds of the undriven vehicle wheels and representing the speed and the acceleration of the vehicle exceed the threshold value. The threshold value of the speed of the vehicle which value governs the control process, is preferably regulated in accordance with the transverse acceleration which acts on the vehicle whenever it follows a curved path, thus performing a control of the vehicle behaviour depending on the detected vehicle speed and being additionally adapted to the vehicle cornering state. This document also discloses the use of a conventional anti skid brake system in combination with the mentioned wheel slip control system. Furthermore, document DE A 18 06 671 discloses an electrically controlled system for preventing a spinning of the driven wheels of a vehicle in which the rotational slippage between the driven and non driven wheels is determined, and in which the rotational speed of the driven wheels is controlled dependent on the magnitude of such a slippage. To this end, the hydraulic circuit of the system is provided with a single pressure source including a pressure tank supplied by a pump and a plurality of valves being energized or deenergized in accordance with the detected slippage to supply the respective wheel brakes with the required hydraulic pressure. In a normal operating condition the vehicle brake can be actuated in a conventional manner by means of a brake pedal. When a slippage of the driven wheels in relation to a non driven wheel is detected, a special inlet valve is opened to provide the wheel brakes of the driven wheels with a hydraulic pressure. In order to deactivate the entire control system during the actuation of the brake pedal, a contact is connected with a brake light switch, the signal of which serves to control the respective magnetic valves accordingly, since the whole hydraulic circuit is based on only one single pressure source used for controlling both the acceleration and braking slippage. It is an object of the present invention to solve the foregoing problems and easily provide a wheel slip control system capable of controlling the frictional force between the driven wheel tire and the road surface accurately and responsively upon detection of a wheel slip condition during the vehicle accelerating operation. Another object of this invention is to provide a wheel slip control system which uses a slip control means, e.g., anti skid control means, and an additional pressure source already installed on the vehicle to control the braking force of wheels including the driven wheels so that an excessive slip, such as idle running of driven wheel and accompanying skid, is prevented, whereby the driven wheels produce an optimal traction force. Still another object of this invention is to provide a wheel slip control system including a minimum of device required for traction control, and having a simple arrangement for the overall wheel slip control. A further object of this invention is to provide a wheel slip control system which readily provides a traction control ability for a vehicle installing an anti skid control system and an additional pressure source. According to the present invention these objects are accomplished by The wheel slip control system according to the present invention is designed to detect the difference between the hydraulic pressure produced by the first hydraulic system in accordance to the braking action of the driver and the hydraulic pressure produced by the second hydraulic system installed in the vehicle, and to conduct the higher hydraulic pressure selectively to the wheel brakes in accordance with the result of the detection, thereby ensuring that, if the braking means is sufficiently operated by the driver, the hydraulic pressure of the braking means is applied to the driven wheels and the first hydraulic system. This scheme allows the driver to have priority in taking a braking action, whereas, in addition, a slip control during the acceleration of the vehicle is attained safely without impairing the feeling of operating the braking means. Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. In Fig. 2 showing generally an embodiment of the inventive wheel slip control system, the arrangement includes a brake pedal 1, a brake master cylinder 2 serving as the first pressure source for providing a brake hydraulic pressure in response to a displacement of the brake pedal 1, a sub master cylinder 3 serving as the second pressure source for providing a brake hydraulic pressure derived from the power steering hydraulic system upon detection of an acceleration slip as described later, non driven right and left wheels 4 and 5 of the vehicle, driven right and left wheels 6 and 7, wheel cylinders 8 11 provided for the wheels 4 7, a first hydraulic system 15 in the form of an anti skid hydraulic system 15 used for anti skid control, a second hydraulic system in the form of a power steering hydraulic system 20 of the vehicle, a non driven wheel speed sensor 25 generating a pulse signal at frequencies in proportion to the rotational speed of the non driven wheels 4 and 5, a driven wheel speed sensor 26 generating pulse signal at frequencies in proportion to the rotational speed of the driven wheels 6 and 7, and an electronic control circuit 30 implementing anti skid control and traction control as well. The brake master cylinder 2 is of a tandem master cylinder assembly, supplying a brake oil pressure to the wheel cylinders 8 and 9 on the non driven wheels 4 and 5 in one hydraulic system, and to the wheel cylinders 10 and 11 of the driven wheels 6 and 7 in another. The brake oil pressure produced by the sub master cylinder 3 is used for the braking of driven wheels 6 and 7, and as to which of this brake hydraulic pressure or that produced by the brake master cylinder 2 is supplied by way of the anti skid hydraulic system 15 to the wheel cylinders 10 and 11 is determined by a change valve 32 serving as the pressure source selection means. The change valve 32 has the structure of a shuttle valve, supplying the higher of the above two hydraulic pressures to the anti skid hydraulic system 15. The anti skid hydraulic system 15 has major hydraulic paths for supplying the pressure from the change valve 32 to the wheel cylinders 10 and 11 via a 3 position valve 34, and operates to increase the pressure by means of an oil pump 36 and hold or decrease release the pressure to a reservoir 38 depending o on the position of the 3 position valve 34. The system 15 further includes check valves 39, 40 and 41, the hydraulic path via the valve 41 being used to decrease the pressure decrease the braking force by the operation of the brake pedal when the 3 position valve 34 is set at hold position. The 3 position valve 34 is operated by the electronic circuit 30, and positions Next, the power steering hydraulic system 20 will be described. The power steering hydraulic system 20 consists of an oil pump 52 for pumping up the hydraulic oil used in the system from a reservoir tank 51, check valves 53 and 54 for conducting the oil flow in one way, a steering gear box 55, an oil pressure switch 56 which turns on low level when the oil pressure in the steering gear box 55 increase due to steering operation, a 2 position valve 57 will be termed M C up pressure valve hereinafter having Next, a section 30 of the electronic control circuit 30 for implementing traction control will be described with reference to Fig. 3. Besides the traction control circuit 30 , the electronic control circuit 30 includes the anti skid control circuit ESC , but this section unrelated directly to the present invention will be disregarded in the following description. Briefly, the traction control circuit 30 operates to receive the pulse signal from the non driven wheel speed sensor 25 on an F V converter 70, differentiate its voltage output Vfr by a differentiator 71 to obtain the acceleration of the vehicle, and compare the differentiated output with a zero level by a comparator 72 to obtain a signal Vfc indicative of as to whether the vehicle is in acceleration or deceleration. The signal Vfc is sent to the anti skid control circuit ESC, which is activated when Vfc is at a low level. Based on the signal Vfr representing the non driven wheel speed, a threshold 1 generator 73 and an adder 74 in unison produce the first slip threshold level Vrl, and a threshold 2 generator 76 and an adder 77 in unison produce the second slip threshold level Vrh. These voltage levels are compared by comparators 80 and 81, respectively, with the voltage signal Vrr which is derived from the pulse signal generated by the driven wheel sensor speed 26 and converted into voltage by an F V converter 79, and two slip threshold signals Vcl and Vch are obtained. These signals indicated comparison of the driven wheel speed Vrr with the lower threshold level Vrl and upper threshold level Vrh provided based on the non driven wheel speed Vfr as shown at the top of Fig. 4. The lower slip threshold signal Vcl gives a timing for the preparation of traction control, while the upper slip threshold signal Vch gives a timing for carrying out traction control by increasing the brake oil pressure. The traction control circuit 30 further operates to differentiate the signal Vrr representing the driven wheel speed to obtain a signal Vrg representing the accelerating of the driven wheels 6 and 7. The signal Vrg is compared with an output signal G1 from a threshold 3 generator 84 and an output signal G2 from a threshold 4 generator 85 by comparators 87 and 88, respectively, and the first slip control signal Vrgh and second slip control signal Vrgl are obtained. The above three signal processing systems perform traction control as shown in Fig. 4. In operation, when the vehicle accelerates to have a high Vfc signal, a lower slip threshold signal Vcl goes high, causing a delay circuit 89 formed of a monostable multivibrator to produce a high output, and a 2 input AND gate 90a produces a high output Vrt as shown in Fig. 4. This signal goes through a 2 input OR gate 91 and an amplifier 92 to activate the oil pump 36 in the anti skid hydraulic system 15 and, at the same time, goes through an amplifier 90b to switch the M C up pressure valve 57 to position The 3 position valve 34 in the anti skid hydraulic system 15 has its three positions The amplifier 96 for driving the transistor Tr2 receives the output Vru of a 3 input AND gate 97, which signal Vru is determined from the logical sum of the output of a 2 input NAND gate 98 receiving the upper slip threshold signal Vch and first slip control signal Vrgh, the signal Vrt, and the control signal from the anti skid control circuit ESC , as shown in Fig. 4. While, the amplifier 95 for driving the transistor Tr1 receives the output signal Vrd of a 2 input OR gate 99, which signal Vrd is determined form the logical sum of the output of a 2 input AND gate 101 receiving the lower slip threshold signal Vcl inverted by an inverter 100 and the second slip control signal Vrgl, and the input signal from the ESC. As a result of the foregoing arrangement of this embodiment, A When the vehicle accelerates as detected on the non driven wheels 4 and 5, the power steering oil pressure is high enough, the control operation proceeds as follows Next, the second embodiment of this invention will be described. The second embodiment is intended to control the hydraulic systems and associated devices similar to those of the first embodiment shown in Fig. 2 through an electronic control circuit 30 which is in this case constituted mainly by a microcomputer as shown in Fig. 5. The arrangement of Fig. 5 includes a central processing unit CPU 110 which is programmed to receive the sensor signals from the driven wheel speed sensor 26, non driven wheel speed sensor 25 and oil pressure switch 56, and perform various calculations in response to these input signals. Other circuit components included are a read only memory ROM 112 for storing the above mentioned CPU control program, maps, and fixed data, a random access memory RAM 113 for performing reading and writing sensor input data temporarily, and calculation data, an input interface circuit 114 including waveform shaping circuits and a multiplexer for supplying sensor input signals selectively to the CPU 110, an output circuit 116 for driving the oil pump 36, M C up pressure valve 57 and PS up pressure valve 58 and also driving the 3 position valve 34 through transistors Tr1 and Tr2, a bus line 118 for providing data communication between the CPU 110, ROM 112, RAM 113, and input output interface circuits 114 and 116, and a power supply circuit 120 for all of the above circuit components. The traction control operation which is carried out together with anti skid control on a time division basis by the electronic control circuit 30 arranged as described above will be described in connection with the flowchart shown in Fig. 6. Step 200 Read input data on the input interface circuit 114 of the driven wheel speed vr from the driven wheel speed or 26, the non driven wheel speed vf from the non driven wheel speed sensor 25, and the switch state from the oil pressure switch 56. Step 220 Perform differentiation process for the driven wheel speed vr to obtain acceleration of the driven wheels 6 and 7. Step 230 Test whether the driven wheel acceleration α is above zero acceleration . Step 240 Calculate the slip threshold levels vs1 and vs2 from the non driven wheel speed vf using predetermined constants K1, K2 K2 K1 , g1 and g2, as follows. Step 260 Set a predetermined value to the counter C in the CPU. Step 270 Reset the counter C to zero. Step 280 Decrement the counter C by one. Step 290 Test whether the content of counter C is above than zero. The counter C used in the steps 260 290 is actually a programmed operation substituting the delay circuit 89 in the first embodiment, and its purpose is to continue traction control for a present time length when the speed vr has fallen below the first threshold level vs1 after traction control had been commenced. Step 293 Test whether the oil pressure switch 56 is OFF. If the oil pressure switch is OFF, indicating the steering operation being inert and the power steering hydraulic pressure not being increased, the sequence proceeds to step 350. Step 296 If the oil pressure switch 56 is found ON in step 293, indicating the steering operation, the PS up pressure valve 58 is reset to position Step 300 Set or hold the M C up pressure valve 57 in the power steering hydraulic system 20 to position Step 303 Test whether the oil pressure switch 56 is OFF. Step 306 If the oil pressure switch 56 is OFF, switch the PS up pressure valve 58 to position Step 309 if the oil pressure switch 56 is ON, switch the PS up pressure valve 58 to position Step 310 Test whether the driven wheel speed vr is higher than the second threshold level vs2. Step 320 Reset or hold the M C up pressure valve 57 and PS up pressure valve 58 to positions Step 330 Set or hold the 3 position valve 34 in the anti skid hydraulic system 15 to position Step 340 Set the 3 position valve 34 to position Step 350 Set the 3 position valve 34 to position According to this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 7, A When the driven wheels 6 and 7 are found accelerating α 0 , i.e., an affirmative decision made by step 230, the control operation takes place as follows. Next, the third embodiment of the invention will be described. This embodiment features to detect the differential pressure between the first and second pressure sources and allow the control means to select a brake pressure source depending on the detection result so that more stable traction control can take place through the provision of a hysteresis or priority rule in selecting a pressure source. The arrangement of the third embodiment will be described in connection with Fig. 8, with portions identical to parts of the first and second embodiments being disregarded in the following description. The new arrangement employs a 3 port, 2 position electromagnetic valve of a spring offset type will be termed simply switch valve 32 hereinater as a pressure source selection means in place of the change valve 32 used in the previous embodiment. The switch valve 32 operates in response to the command of the electronic control circuit 30 to conduct the higher of the two pressure sources to the anti skid hydraulic system 15. A differential pressure switch 33 is provided for the electronic control circuit 30 to compare the pressure of two hydraulic sources, and the swtich 33 produces an ON signal to operate the switch valve 33 when the pressure of the brake master cylinder 2 is higher than the sub master cylinder 3. Fig. 9 shows the circuit diagram of the electronic control circuit 30 for implementing the switching operation of the switch valve 32 . The arrangement includes an inverter 32a, which receives and inverts the output signal from the differential pressure switch 33 and delivers the inverted output to an amplifier 32b, by which output the solenoid of the switch valve 32 is energized. Accordingly, on the normal running condition in which the hydraulic pressure of the sub master cylinder 3 is discharged to the drain 51, the pressure of the brake master cylinder 2 is added to the anti skid hydraulic system 15 so that the driver s action is reflected on a first priority basis. During the aforementioned traction control, the driver does not normally take a braking action, and the sub master cylinder 3 receiving pressure from the power steering hydraulic system 20 has an increased oil pressure to activate the switch valve 32 , thereby conducting its pressure to the anti skid hydraulic system 15. In case the driver takes a braking action during the traction control, an increased pressure in the brake master cylinder 2 as detected by the differential pressure switch 33 causes the switch valve 32 to be deenergised, whereby the driver s will is reflected on the operation on a first priority basis and at the same time the feeling of depressing the brake pedal 1 is not affected. Fig. 10 shows the fourth embodiment of this invention, in which the differential pressure switch 33 sends its output to the electronic control circuit 30. The control operation will be described with reference to Fig. 11. The flowchart of Fig. 11 differs from that of the second embodiment shown in Fig. 6 in the addition of step 245. The step 245 tests the state of the differential pressure switch 33. When the driver does not take a braking action and thus the brake master cylinder 2 has a low pressure, the sequence responds to a negative decision of step 245 to proceed to step 250. If the step 250 makes an affirmative decision, the sequence proceeds to step 270 in which the counter C is reset to zero as in the case of the previous embodiment. The third and fourth embodiments are designed to detect the difference between the brake oil pressure produced by the driver s braking action and the brake oil pressure produced by another pressure source installed on the vehicle, and conduct one of them selectively to the braking device in accordance with the result of detection. This scheme allows the driver to have priority in taking a braking action, and the traction control is accomplished without impairing the feeling of operating the brake pedal 1. By making the control means for selecting a brake oil pressure source to be responsive to the change in the differential pressure of the two sources through the provision of a hysteresis or priority rule, for example, a more sophisticated traction control can be realized.
