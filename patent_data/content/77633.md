# Filter media.

## Abstract
Filter media comprised of charge modified, resin coated inorganic microfibers are prepared by mixing inorganic microfibers with an aqueous solution of a water soluble, noncolloidal cationic thermosetting binder resin to form a dispersion, following which a precipitating agent is added to precipitate the binder resin and coat the microfibers. The coated microfibers may be used in the dispersed or sus pended form as a filter aid. Preferably they are formed into a filter sheet which is then dried and cured to form a filter sheet of narrowly distributed pore size, pore sizes as small as one half micron, and having a positive zeta potential in alkaline media. Glass is the preferred microfiber and polyamine epichlorohydrins the preferred resins. By provid ing the normally negative zeta potential microfibers with a positive zeta potential the binder resins used to coat the microfibers substantially enhance particulate removal capa bilities of the microfiber filter sheet.
