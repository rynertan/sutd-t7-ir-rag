# LONG LIFE PORTABLE OXYGEN SENSOR

## Abstract
A long life oxygen sensor is provided. The oxygen sensor includes an oxygen permeable membrane exposed to the gas to be sensed, a catalyzed oxygen reduction electrode wet with a hydroxide, a porous metal counter electrode subject to oxidation and an electrical circuit capable of displaying the relation between electrical current generated between the electrodes of the device and the partial pressure of oxygen at the permeable membrane.
