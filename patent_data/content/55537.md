# Inhaler.

## Abstract
An inhaler comprises a vapour producing unit 12 , and a cover 3 incorporating a vapour feeding nozzle 2 . The vapour feeding nozzle 2 is pivotally mounted on the cover 3 in such a manner that the vapour feeding nozzle 2 can be tilted at a desired angle. Also, a novel construction of an inner mechanism for the inhaler is disclosed.
