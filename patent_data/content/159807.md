## Description
This invention is directed to a method for oxidizing a flue gas desulfurization waste product to yield a useful end product and to the oxidized product produced by the process. The combustion of cool in power plants generates large volumes of solid and gaseous pollutants, including fly ash and sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide has been identified as the culprit in acid rain and substantial effort has been directed to reducing or eliminating the amount of sulfur dioxide discharged into the atmosphere by coal fired boilers. One route taken to accomplish this end is to treat the off gases of the boiler the flue gas to remove the sulfur dioxide therefrom by reacting it with a calcium containing compound to form calcium sulfur compounds. These calcium sulfur compounds have then been disposed of by ponding, if the compounds are in the form of a sludge, or as land fill if the compounds are dry. The most common flue gas desulfurization FGD process is known as the wet process. In that process the sulfur dioxide containing flue gas is scrubbed with a slurry containing calcium hydroxide or another hydrated alkaline absorbent. The scrubbing takes place, for example, in a tower in which the gas flow is countercurrent to and in intimate contact with a stream of descending slurry. The slurry may flow over packing or trays within the tower. The spent slurry product of this FGD process contains both calcium sulfite and calcium sulfate. It has been found to be advantageous to convert the calcium sulfite in the product to calcium sulfate by bubbling air or other oxygen containing gas through the slurry. Such a process is shown, for example, in US A 4,024,220, which issued 17 May 1977. The calcium sulfate product may be used in the production of wall board. Other U.S. patents which disclose various features of the wet process are In the dry process FGD system, sulfur dioxide containing flue gas is introduced into a spray drier in which a slurry of a lime containing liquid is sprayed into contact with the flue gas. Reactions occur between the lime and the sulfur dioxide in the flue gas, while the liquid of the slurry is evaporated, yielding an essentially dry powder containing calcium sulfur compounds. Such a process is shown, for example, in US A 4,197,278, which issued 8 April 1980. The dry powder product contains both calcium sulfite and calcium sulfate and it has been suggested that this powder be reslurried and then subjected to oxidation by bubbling air therethrough to convert the calcium sulfite to calcium sulfate in accordance with the teachings of the wet process prior art as described above. As described above, a characteristic of the dry FGD system is that the liquid phase of the fresh absorbent when injected into the spray drying tower, is very nearly completely evaporated when the flue gas leaves the tower. The dry, spent absorbent of fine grained particles is first entrained in the desulfurized flue gas and is then partially separated and collected in the bottom section of the spray drying tower, with the remaining entrained portion removed from the flue gas flow in a final dust collecting system, usually a bag filter. The fresh or make up absorbent is often supplied to the FGD system in dry form burned lime , where it has to be converted into a liquor, by slaking in water. The system for preparing and injecting the liquid absorbent comprises Part of the collected dry, spent absorbent is repulped with the fresh liquor absorbent to improve the utilization of the absorbent since unreacted absorbent does pass through the spray dryer. This repulping is normally performed in a separate repulping vessel. The recycle ratio is typically 3 1 i.e., three parts of recycled spent absorbent to one part of raw feed. The following table sets forth typical characteristics of the FGD product of the dry FGD system where milk of lime is used as the absorbent sprayed into the flue gas The calcium sulfite is directly formed when milk of lime reacts with gaseous sulfur dioxide. In the temperature range of 70 150 C, at which a spray drying tower normally operates in FGD systems, and because of the relatively low oxygen levels of 3 5 in the flue gas, only a small part of the calcium sulfite is oxidized into the sulfate form. Part of the milk of lime does not react at all serving as the excess absorbent required for a high percentage removal of SO₂ , while another part of the milk of lime is carbonated due to the high CO₂ level of the flue gas. Most coals also contain some chlorine, which becomes volatile during combustion and which also reacts with the milk of lime in the spray drying tower forming CaCl₂. The flue gas also contains an entrained fly ash component which must be dealt with. Fly ash typically contains the following compounds Accordingly, there have been efforts in recent years to develop an oxidation process for treating the dry powder calcium sulfite calcium sulfate product of the spray drying process of flue gas desulfurization to obtain an oxidized product having a high calcium sulfate content which can be utilized in the known markets. Certain of these efforts are described in the following publications EP A 74,258, published 16 March 1983, is directed to a process for treating spent absorbents resulting from desulfurization of flue gas in a spray drying absorption process, the absorbents containing substantial amounts of sulfite. The sulfite is oxidized into sulfate by heating the spent absorbent in the presence of an oxygen containing gas at temperatures in the range of 350 600 C. DE A 3135200, published 17 March 1983, is directed to a process for the treatment of the end products of flue gas desulfurization, the flue gas desulfurization being effected by absorption of sulfur oxides in a spray drier with a calcium containing suspension or in a reactor with dry granular calcium containing absorbent. The end products of the flue gas desulfurization comprise the compounds, calcium sulfite hemihydrate and or calcium sulfite and or calcium sulfate dihydrate and or calcium sulfate hemihydrate and or calcium sulfate, with the balance the unreacted absorbent Ca OH ₂. The calcium sulfite containing end products are treated by dry oxidation with air at temperatures between 400 and 800 C and, preferably, between 400 and 600 C. Experience in thermal processing roasting, calcination at high temperatures 400 1000 C of various fine grained materials for example, lime mud, cryolite, pyrites in fluidized bed reactors has shown that it is sometimes possible to achieve under certain conditions agglomeration sintering of the fine particles into pellets with a diameter of several millimeters. In US A 2,465,410, issued 29 March 1949, there is disclosed a process for calcining lime bearing sludge such as paper mill causticizing sludge, water softening sludge, sludge from first carbonation or other lime sludge producing stations in sugar factories. The sludge solids are provided with a proper quantity of an adhesive substance soda being an example which softens and becomes adhesive at elevated temperature to cause particle agglomeration so that the calcined product is in the form of essentially dust free nodules or pellets. EP A 164192, published after the priority date of the present application, discloses a method of treating a dry particulate material with an oxygen containing gas in a fluidized bed, said material deriving from a flue gas desulfurization process in which process an alkaline earth metal compound has been used as absorbent, said particulate material containing alkaline earth metal sulfite and sulfate and possible fly ash originally present in the flue gas, said particulate material being able to form agglomerates when heated above a certain agglomeration temperature, for converting a substantial part of said sulfite into sulfate by an exothermic reaction, comprising the steps of This document proposes a fluidized bed temperature above 600 C which, according to its priority document might be up to 700 C although EP 0164192 itself makes no reference to a fluidized bed temperature of 700 C. According to a first aspect of the present invention we provide a method for oxidising a particulate fine grained calcium sulphite material which is the spent absorbent of a flue gas desulphurization process, to form calcium sulphate, comprising the steps of According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a dry flue gas desulfurization process wherein the gas is first dedusted to remove fly ash and thereafter is passed through a spray drier in which the gas is subjected to a spray of an absorbent liquid comprising milk of lime, the absorbent reacting with the sulphur dioxide in said gas while the liquid component thereof evaporates, thereby yielding a fine grained dry spent absorbent composed primarily of calcium sulphite and calcium sulphate, and wherein the spent absorbent is treated to produce pellets composed primarily of calcium sulphate, by the method set forth in the preceeding paragraph. According to yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided a pellet of calcium sulphate having a diameter in the range from 0.5mm to 5mm composed of agglomerated particles having an average size range of from about 50µm to about 100µm and having binder components therein in an amount from about 1 to about 3 , by weight, less than 0.125 by weight sulphide, with small amounts of impurities and inerts, the balance being essentially calcium sulphate. Broadly stated, the process of this invention calls for oxidizing a power like calcium sulfite material, which is the waste product or spent absorbent of a flue gas desulfurization process, to produce a pelletized calcium sulfate anhydrite product having commercial utility. As used herein, the term calcium sulfite material means the FGD product as received from the spray drying tower of a dry flue gas desulfurization process. It is the reaction product of a milk of lime slurry and sulfur dioxide at a temperature in the range 100 180 C and contains calcium sulfite, calcium sulfate and small amounts of other calcium sulfur compounds, binders and inerts. In more detail, the powder like, fine grained calcium sulfite material containing a small amount say, 1 to 3 by weight of relatively low melting constituents, is subjected to oxidation in a fluidized bed reactor in which air is the fluidizing medium and the operating temperature of the reactor is maintained in the range from above 700 to 1000 C and, preferably, at a temperature over 800 C. At the operating temperature maintained in the reactor, the relatively low melting or bidning constituent of the calcium sulfite material is in the liquid phase and this small amount of sticky molten compounds produces pelletization of the fine grained spent absorbent. The process achieves a high oxidation yield of calcium sulfite, and, in addition to the oxidation of calcium sulfite, any calcium sulfide formed by disproportionation as described hereinafter is also oxidized to calcium sulfate. A controlled pelletization is essential addition of small amounts of low melting constituents are made to calcium sulfite material deficient in such constituents to ensure adequate pelletization. In the case where excessive amounts of low melting constituents are present in the calcium sulfite material, the addition of compounds which react with the binder compounds at the operating temperature of the reactor to form high melting compounds is undertaken to reduce the molten portion of the fluidized calcium sulfite material so that excessive pelletization lump formation is avoided. Another method for reducing the binder content of the calcium sulfite material is to employ countercurrent washing of the calcium sulfite material to dissolve out the excess binder present before the oxidation treatment. When high melting or low melting compounds are to be provided for reaction in the oxidation process, they can be added, as described above, directly to the calcium sulfite material feed, or such compounds may be added to the fresh absorbent liquor before it enters the spray drying tower used in the flue gas desulfurization process. In order to further promote pelletization, a portion of the pellets produced in the process may be ground to a particle size intermediate that of the spent absorbent raw material and the oxidized pellet product and then fed recycled into the fluidized bed reactor with the calcium sulfite feed as nuclei for pelletization. In order to make an FGD product acceptable for the building industry, the sulfate content must be the predominant constituent and the amount of other constituents should not fluctuate too widely. These two conditions mean that the fly ash content must lie in the range between 0 and 10 of the total weight of dry FGD product. Consequently, this requirement means that a pre dust collector with a collecting efficiency of 80 90 of the total fly ash in the boiler flue gas, should be installed upstream of the spray drying tower. In the absence of a pre dust collector, the fly ash content of the dry FGD product could vary between 25 and 200 of the total calcium compounds, which is unacceptable for commercial use in most cement mills. Normally, boilers operate at flame temperatures above 1200 1400 C, at which the silica as well as iron and aluminum oxides combine to form a complex compound, similar to the process which takes place in clinker kiln in a cement mill. This means that the compounds in the fly ash are not available individually but are fixed in the Fe Al Si complex compounds. Pelletization of the fine FGD product is highly desirable for the following reasons The basic mechanism for this pelletization is to have a relatively small portion 1 3 of the fluidized bed material molten at the operating temperature range. This liquid phase has usually sticky characteristics and therefore can serve as a binding agent for binding the particles together. The liquid portion of the fluidized bed may consist of pure compounds, having a melting point below the operating temperature however, it is well known that the melting point of specific mixtures eutectics of certain pure compounds can be considerably lower than the melting point of each individual pure component. Therefore, very small quantities of impurities may have a significant influence and consequently predicting the quantity of bed material in the molten phase at a certain temperature is usually a complicated question. This means that some skill and experimental testwork is required to establish the operating conditions favoring the desired pelletization for a particular product or process. Satisfactory pelletization is defined as capture of 85 to 95 of the feed material. Pelletization was immediately apparent in the initial test work done and was found to be a function of chloride content and operating temperature. Good pellet growth was achieved at 600 C with 4 Cl, 700 C with 2.6 Cl and 800 C with 2 Cl. Impurities and or inerts in the feed material do not tend to pelletize and are preferentially separated from the product and carried out with the stack gases. This means that large quantities of inerts results in high carryover. The feature of this phenomena is that it improves the purity of the bed product. The dry FGD product normally contains a varying amount of calcium chloride, dependent on the sulfur chlorine ratio of the particular coal used. It was found that if the CaCl₂ content of the feed is not sufficient to achieve good pelletization, other compounds having a melting point below 800 C can serve to make up the balance of the liquid phase required. Suitable binders are sodium and potassium compounds like Na₂CO₃, NaOH which forms Na₂CO₃ in the presence of CO₂ , K₂SO₄ and K₂CO₃. Other binding agents worthy of consideration are Na₂SiO₃ and NH₄ ₂SO₄. While NaCl or KCl can also certainly serve as binders when added to the feed, the chloride content of the pelletized product should be kept low when used in cement, and therefore addition of these chlorides are normally not desired. As mentioned above, the activity of a portion of the binding agents can also be neutralized by adding a suitable component to the FGD product which reacts with certain binding agents in such a way that compounds with a higher melting point are formed with the chlorine being driven off as a vapor. An example of this solution is the addition of silica, which reacts with CaCl₂ in the presence of water according to It has been found that at temperatures somewhat above 550 C, a significant portion of the sulfite content of the dry FGD product is converted into the sulfate form, but that simultaneously an appreciable amount of sulfide is formed, although almost no sulfide was present in the feed itself. This phenomenon can be explained by the following reaction The tests showed that virtually all of the sulfites were rapidly converted to either sulfides or sulfates. The problem remaining then, is to oxidize the sulfides, which is more difficult than oxidizing the sulfite. At 600 C, about half of the sulfur appeared to disproportionate. The abovementioned phenomenon is illustrated in the curves of Figure 3, showing the results of tests with a dry FGD product originally containing 40 CaSO₃ and 0 CaS and with a low chloride content which was not sufficient for pelletization. This material was heated for two hours at various temperatures and in various oxygen atmospheres. Figure 3 shows that CaS is formed only when the material is heated well above 500 C and increases initially with increasing temperature. The maximum sulfide content is formed at around 575 C. When heated above 575 C, the CaS content decreases steadily as temperature increases. The same graph shows that the CaS content is lower when oxygen available for reaction is increased however, it is not commercially attractive to provide more than about 5 excess oxygen. CaS is an undesired compound in the FGD product. When applied as technical anhydrite in the building industry, it evolves a nuisance odor due to the generation of H₂S when in contact with water therefore, it is important to minimize the CaS content of the final product. Figure 2 shows that the residual CaSO₃ content after heating decreases continuously with increasing temperature. From the above, it can be concluded that the FGD product has to be oxidized at a temperature well above 700 C to achieve a high oxidation rate over 95 and low residual sulfite and sulfide content. In pilot plant tests it was shown that the oxidation temperature is preferably over 800 C to produce product pellets which are oxidized at least 95 . In Figure 1, the oxidizing system of the invention is shown as applied to treat the FGD product of a system for handling the flue gas from a coal burning boiler. Referring to Figure 1, the flue gas generated in boiler 10 passes through conduits 11 to the electrostatic precipitator 15 wherein the fly ash entrained in the flue gas is precipitated and removed from the system through outlets 16. The electrostatic precipitator is effective to remove 90 95 of the fly ash from the flue gas. The relatively dust free flue gas passes from the electrostatic precipitator 15 to the spray drying tower 20 through conduit 17. In spray drying tower 20 a slurry of milk of lime, Ca OH ₂, is sprayed through the flue gas from one or more injection nozzles 23. A reaction occurs at the tower temperature of 100 180 C between the milk of lime slurry and the sulfur dioxide, SO₂, to form calcium sulfite material as defined above . A large part of the calcium sulfite material falls to the bottom of spray drying tower 20 and is removed from the spray drying tower through conduit 21. Continuing to follow the path of the flue gas, the gas passes from spray drying tower 20 to bag house 25 through conduit 22. In the bag house 25, the gas is separated from any calcium sulfite material entrained therein and then leaves the bag house through conduit 27 for possible further treatment not shown and ultimate discharge through stack 28. The calcium sulfite material 50µm to 100µm average diameter separated in the bag house 25 leaves that unit through conduit 26. The treatment of the calcium sulfite material, the FGD product, will now be described, referring to Figure 1. The conduits 21 and 26 discharge their portions of the FGD product flow into line 29 which joins lines 51 and 43. At the juncture of lines 29, 43 and 51, the flow from line 29 is split by means not shown so that a portion of the flow passes into line 51 and the remainder into line 43. Line 51 is connected to the fluidized bed reactor 55 and the FGD product introduced thereby forms the bed material thereof. Line 57 introduces a flow of air into the bottom of reactor 55 as the fluidizing medium for the bed which is supported on the constriction plate 54 of reactor 55. Fuel, preferably oil or gas, is introduced through line 62 in an amount sufficient to maintain a temperature in the range from about 700 C to about 1000 C, preferably above 800 C. In this temperature range, in the presence of the air introduced as the fluidizing medium, the FGD product calcium sulfite material is oxidized to calcium sulfate. In order to control pelletization of the fine grained FGD product in fluidized bed reactor 55, nuclei of a size between that of the fine grained feed and the desired pellets are provided by a grinder 60. Grinder 60 receives pellets formed in the fluidized bed reactor 55 through line 59 and reduces them to the desired size. These nuclei are then returned to the fluidized bed reactor 55 through line 61. In the event that the feed FGD has too much or too little binder material, appropriate additives may be introduced into the feed FGD material through line 53 in dotted line showing . Thus, Na₂CO₃ is added where insufficient binder is present in the feed, whereas silica is added where excessive binder is present to form high melting compounds with some portion of the binder compounds. The oxidized product pellets 0.5mm to 5mm average diameter , composed primarily of calcium sulfate, are withdrawn from the fluidized bed reactor 55 through outlet conduit 52 to a cooler unit 66 to cool the oxidized product pellets to ambient temperature. That portion of the FGD product which passes from line 29 to line 43 is conducted to the repulper 45. It will be understood that there remains in the FGD product a substantial amount of unreacted calcium compounds. These unreacted compounds are mixed with fresh milk of lime slurry fed through line 39 into repulper 45 in which a stirring element 41 is provided. There is thus a high utilization achieved of the lime addition to the process. From repulper 45 the milk of lime slurry passes through line 44 to pump 46 which pumps the slurry through line 19 to the injection nozzle of nozzles 23 at spray drying tower 20. It should be noted that additions of the type discussed with reference to line 53 may optionally be made at the point in the process indicated by the dotted line showing 42. Figure 1 shows a separate repulper 35 in which the milk of lime slurry is prepared, with burnt lime CaO for example, introduced through line 37 while water is introduced through line 38. A stirrer 36 is provided for repulper 35. The milk of lime slurry thus prepared in repulper 35 is passed into repulper 45 through line 39. One more aspect of the process should be considered with reference to Figure 1 and that is the situation where excessive chlorides, principally CaCl₂, are present in the FGD product. In that case, a washing step may be provided. It may be located in line 43 with the FGD product enroute to repulper 45 being washed in water. The chlorides are highly soluble in water and, accordingly, can be drastically reduced or eliminated from the final product by washing. This washing procedure can be carried out with counter current flows in a set of hydrocyclones, thickeners and filters specific washing circuit not illustrated .
