# A method of making compacted graphite iron.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for making compacted graphite cast iron of improved strength and hardness while retaining excellent thermal conductivity, low shrinkage, and excellent damping characteristics. A ferrous alloy is melted consisting essentially of, by weight, 3 4 C, 2 3 Si, .2 .7 Mn, .25 .4 Mo, .5 3.0 Ni, up to .002 sulfur, up to .02 phosphorus, and impurities or contaminants up to 1.0 , with the remainder being essentially iron. The melt is subjected to a graphite modifying agent to form compacted graphite upon solidification. The solidified casting is heat treated by austempering and quenching to produce an iron having a matrix of bainite and austenite.
