# Low alloy steels for use in pressure vessels.

## Abstract
Low alloy steels for use in pressure vessels comprising on a weight basis C from 0.05 to 0.30 , Si less than 0.10 , Mn from 0.3 to 1.5 , Ni from inevitably incorporated content to 0.55 , Cr from 1.5 to 5.5 , Mo from 0.25 to 1.5 , V in excess of 0.10 and less than 0.6 , and the balance of iron and inevitably incorporated impurities. The steels are excellent in hardenability, hot strength, toughness, weldability and hydrogen attack and embrittle ment resistance, as well as showing excellent toughness after use in the temper brittle temperature region.
