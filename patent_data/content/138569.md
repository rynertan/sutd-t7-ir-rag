## Description
NETHOD AND DEVICE FOR 8SIMULATING CLIMBING Background of Invention Various forms of exercise such as swimming, jogging, cycling and rowing have been popular. An additional exercise which is rapidly gaining in popularity is climbing. In fact, climbing has a number of distinct advantages over these other forms of exercise. For example with climbing the limbs primarily involved in the exercise are used throughout a relatively large range of motion This produces greater energy ex penditures for the total body. Additionally a component of balance is included in the climbing activity. This forces the antagonist anti gravity muscles and stabilizing muscle groups of the upper and lower body to play a more active role in the exercise. There are or should be no impact forces encountered of any significance which means that overuse injuries should not occur. The nature of the rhythmic movement with controlled speed of stepping contributes to this. An abundant amount of medical and physiological data supports the negative aspects of jogging because of. the jarring effects resulting from forces being trznsmitted from the ground, through feet, ankles, knees, hips ane low back.Joggers suffer from fallen arches, ankle sprains, shin splints, knee soreness, heel bone spurs, hip point sorenes and low back pain. It is very difficult for the subject to rest or cheat during the climbing activity, unless it is intentional because it requires continuous coordinated movements with a metronone or rhythmic music. Because of the relatively large vertical displacement of the body which inherently occurs in this activity, the level of intensity of exercises performed on the inventive device will generally be higher than other modes of workouts, resulting in higher overall point values. A bicycle supports the user on a seat and reduces the use of the arms. This decreases the subjects energy expenditure. It has been estimated through research that oxygen uptake requirements are about fourteen percent lower in cycling than treadmill running because of the decreased anti gravity work. Climbing utilizes all major muscle groups with the bench height about ten inches and a stepping rate greater than 25 steps per minute. Swimming incorporates a bouyancy factor, thus reducing the energy expenditure. Climbing during the course of 25 minutes produces a greater energy expenditure than swimming for the average person, because most people cannot swim for 25 continuous minutes. Also, climbing strengthens the muscles of the legs a process missing in swimming. Although, as indicated above, climbing has a number of distinct advantages over other forms of exercise, there is one serious disadvantage in that it is not always convenient for someone to be able to perform the climbing exercise. Summary of Invention An object of this invention is to provide a device which enables the user to simulate climbing in a simple and convenient manner. A further object of this invention is to provide a device for the partial simulating of climbing. A still further object of this invention is to provide a device for the full or continuous simulation of climbing. In accordance with this invention, the partial simulation of climbing is accomplished by means of a device in the form of a frame having an adjustable step so that the user can step up and down from the step. In the preferred practice of this invention, an upstanding handle is located at the step to facilitate the up and down movement. In a variation of this device, a plurality of such steps are provided at different elevations so that the user may step up and then down in the same direction and then turn around and repeat the climbing action. Tn accordance with this invention a device is also provided for the full or continuous simulation of climbing wherein a pair of side by side steps are provided in such a manner that when the user steps with one foot on one step, that step is moved downwardly and then that step returns back up when the user steps on the other step. In accordance with this invention, a device is provided which includes a frame and a vertically adjustable platform. The platform is moved to the desired elevation on the frame in accordance with the particular exercising program. The user then steps onto the platform and then steps back off the platform. This stepping up and stepping down is continuously repeated in rapid succession in order to achieve a partial simulation of climbing. In accordance with an alternative method of this invention, a continuous simulation of climbing is achieved.This is done by providing steps which move downwardly in response to the user s weight. Adjustable resisting means control the amount of resistance offered against the user s weight. In this exercise the user steps with one foot on a step or platform which in turn causes that step to move downwardly whereupon the user then shifts his weight as he steps onto another side by step step causing the first step to move upwardly when the second step mower downwardly. The user then again shifts his weight by stepping back o the first step, and this exercise is continuosly repeated.

Detailed Description U.S. Patent 4,340,218 the details of which are incorporated herein by reference thereto describe devices for the partial simulation of climbing.In this respect, in the use of these devices the user would step upwardly onto a platform or step portion of the device and then would be required to step down and repeat the stepping up and stepping down actions. These devices have the advantage of being portable so that they may be used in the most convenient manner. the present invention is directed in part to other forms of devices for the partial simulation of climbing and in addition to devices for the full or continuous simulation of climbing. As later described, the difference between continuous simulation and partial simulation is that in partial simulation there is a stepping up and then stepping down whereas in continuous simulation the user is continuously in a stepping up motion, and the device itself permits this continuous stepping up motion to take place while the user remains at a fixed location. In general the invention is directed to an exercise in the form of simulated climbing. As described in the patent referred to this form of exercise has numerous distinct advantages over other forms of exercises now being used. The various devices described in the referred to patent and described herein are particularly suitable for such form of exercise. Consequently, it is possible to consider the invention as relating to an ideal aerobic home exercise which permits the use of a device which could be lightweight, portable, stable, economical and could be folded into a convenient compact condition during periods of non use. As later described, since the device involves the simulation of climbing which utilizes a stepping up and down by the user s legs, a total exercise is provided whereby the hands of the user are free. Thus the user may read or do anything else possible as a result of the exercise not requiring use of the hands. Similarly, the user may supplement the exercise by the hands grasping weights so that a weight lifting exercise may take place with the simulated climbing. A distinct advantage with the invention is that an aerobic form of exercise is achieved which eliminates shock which is attendant with conventional aerobic exercises involving a jumping motion. The present invention accomplishes the simulated climbing by making use of the user s own body weight in performing the. exercise. In general one form of exercise involves the partial simulation of climbing. All of the aforenoted parent applications described devices which may be used for accomplishing that form of exercise. Accordingly it is not necessary to repeat in detail the specific forms described in those applications. What the devices have in common as pertains to the partial simulation of climbing is the use of a horizontal platform which may be vertically moved to various positions on a frame in accordance with the desired exercise program. The user would then step up onto the platform and then step back down from the platform. This stepping up and stepping down would be repeated at a relatively rapid pace to thereby simulate climbing. For example, in a given time period the user would have a certain number of cycles of stepping up and down to and from the platform.A preferred range of use is 10 to 30 cycles per minute to be done for a period of 10 to 30 minutes, the most preferred being 20 cycles per minute for 20 minutes. The concepts of this invention may be practiced with various suitable devices Such devices include not only the forms specifically illustrated and described in the parent applications but also various other forms which permit an adjustable step to be varied in its height. Such variations could be in the forms of luggage racks, saw bucks, step stools, step ladders and ironing boards.Figures 1 20 illustrate various alternative forms of devices which may be used in the practice of this invention. Figures 1 3 show a device 10 in accordance with this invention for the partial simulation of climbing.As indicated therein, device 10 comprises five primary components, including a pair of side pieces 12, 14 made of wood or any other suitable material. Side pieces 12, 14 are provided with sets of grooves 16 into which is inserted a permanent support or base member 18 for forming a frame by joining the side pieces i2, 14 together. Base member 18 may be secured to side pieces 12, 14 in any suitable manner such as b screws 20 as illustrated in Figure 1. Side pieces 12, 14 are also provided with different sets of grooves 22 for the selective insertion of a platform 24 which functIons as a step. The height of step 24 may thus be selected by selection of the appropriate pair of grooves in the frame. If desired, for some users, platform or step 24 may be completely omitted, and base member 18 may function as the step. Although not illustrated, platform 24 may be secured in position by any suitable detachable fastener or may be held in position by the close tolerance in the dimensioning in the thickness of platform 24, and the corresponding spacing in the grooves 22. Device 10 includes as a final component an upstanding handle 26 which may be a rod, bar or any other suitable device attached to one of the side pieces such as side piece 14 by suitable detachable fasteners such as bolts and nuts 28. Handle 26 provides the user with a balance during the climbing action. As shown in Figure 3, a portion of platform 24 may be provided with a non skid surface 30. If desired, the nonskid surface may be provided over the entire upper portion of platform 24. Device 10 has a number of distinct advantages. One such advantage is its versatility. In this respect, the adjustable height feature of platform 24 provides a variation of height within a range that allows any size person to use device 10 and in an exercise program to raise the height and thus achieve a progressively more strenuous exercise.The grooves 22 also provide device 10 with a manner of quick and easy adjustment of the step height. Device 10 is also formed of simple construction which permits low production cost so that device 10 can be priced at a level capable of being used by the general public. Moreover the simplified construction of device 10 does not detract from its strength and durability so that device 10 is both safe to use and long lasting. Additionally the simplified construction of device 10 makes the device fairly light weight and not cumbersome in shape while lending itself to convenience in assembly and disassembly so that device 10 may be readily portable and easily set up. Tests done with the partial simulation device built in accordance with the concepts of device 10 have produced significant results when compared to other exercises.Specifically, climbing the device produces energy expenditures at the 17 5 8tut and 19 5 8 heights with cadences of 25 and 30 steps per minute that are greater than jogging at 4 5 1 2 miles per hour. Climbing the device produces greater energy expenditures than does stationary cycling as practiced by the typical home fitness participant. Exercise heart rates generated during use of the device on the 13 3 4 to 19 5 8 heights were 75 97 percent of the age adjusted heart rates of the subjects. Recommended heart rate training levels are generally cited at 70 85 .Use of the device is a very strenuous exercise when coupled with the consistant cadence. Use of the device will produce highly significant gains in aerobic and cardiovascular fitness levels of people if the device is used consistently on a weekly basis.The general recommendation is, of course, three to five days per week. The conclusion reached as a result of these tests is the use of the device has to be considered a significant form of exercise modality that is superior to many other forms of exercise used by the general public. The concepts for practicing this invention along the lines of the device 10 may be accomplished in various manners. For example, Figure 4 shows a modification where device 10A includes dovetailed grooves 16A which would receive corresponding dovetailed sides of base member 18A so as to obviate the use of screws or other fasteners. Figures 5 7 show yet another manner of constructing device lOB. In this variation, base member 18B and side members 12B and 14B are provided with elongated hinges 32 joined together by hinge pins 34. During the non use or storage condition of the device, pins 34 would be removed from hinges 32 and handle 26 would be detaied from side member 14B so that all of the components may be stored in a flat condition as illustrated in Figure 7. In this collapsed condition, hinge pins 34 might be advantageously inserted into selective grooves 22. The feature of being able to store the device in a flat collapsed condition is, of course, not limited to the embodiment of Figures 5 7. Thus in other variations of the device, the components may be disassembled atop each other in a manner similar to Figure 7. Figures 1 7 are particularly directed to a device having a single step. The invention, however, may be practiced by accomplishing partial simulation where a plurality of steps and particularly at least three steps are utilized so that the user would be stepping up and then down at more than one level. In this practice of the invention, a single step would be provided at a first level with a lower step provided on each side of the single step.Figures 8 10 illustrate one such form of this invention. As indicated therein, device 40 is constructed along the same principles as device 10 in that a frame is formed by side members 42, 44 with a base support 46 being inserted in corresponding grooves and with an upper platform 48 inserted into other sets of grooves 50. Device 40 differs from device 10, however, in that the frame is of greater length so that base member 46 provides an actual step member on each side of upper platform 48. Non skid surfaces 52 may be provided at suitable locations on base member 46 with a non skid surface 54 provided on upper step 48. The handle may be a single bar or rod similar to device 10 or may be an inverted U shaped rail 56 as illustrated in Figures 8 10. Device 40 may be considered as turn around or up and over device in that the user would first step upwardly onto base member 46 and then step upwardly onto base member 48 and then step downwardly onto the other portion of base member 46. The user could then step downwardly off base member 46 and turn around and repeat the stepping actions or may turn around while on base member 46. It is to be understood that although Figures 8 10 illustrate three steps, namely base member 46, upper member 48 and base member 46, the concepts of this invention may be practiced with any suitable number of steps, preferably an odd number by arranging the steps in pyramid style.For the sake of simplicity, however, only three such steps are illustrated. Figures 11 13 show a device 60 which is a variation of the turn around or up and over partial simulation of climbing device. In this variation the frame is of Ashape in that each side member includes a pair of supports 62, 64 pivotally joined together at their upper ends by fastener 66. The lower ends of supports 62, 64 are pro vided with self leveling feet 68 which freely pivot about pins 70. The sets of supports 62 and 64 are provided with corresponding holes 72 which may be utilized for securing support rods 74 across a set of supports 62, 64. Rods 86 extend through holes in sets of support rods 74. Steps 78 and 80 are secured to their respective support rods 74 by fasteners 82 which extend through slots in the steps.As with the other embodiment, a handle 84 would be secured to one of the side frames. For added stability additional supports 86 may connect bars or rods 74 together through the use of fasteners 88. Device 60 provides height selectivity in two different manners. Namely the spread or angulation of supports 62, 64 would affect the height of steps 78 and 80 as well as the selection of the appropriate holes 72. Figures 14 16 show yet another device 90 further in accordance with the principles of devices 40 and 60.Device 90 includes as its frame members a pair of front and rear supports each of which is H shaped in the form of a pair of front posts 92, 92 joined together by a base member 96. Similarly a pair of rear posts 94, 94 are also joined together by a base member 98. Members 96 and 98 may be secured to their respective posts by any suitable fasteners. The front posts 92, 92 are secured to the rear posts 94, 94 by stringers 100, 100 which are hollow and fit over selective flanges 102, 102. The stringers 100 function as bridge members for lower step 104 and upper step 106 which are detachably secured to the stringers in any suitable manner as best illustrated in Figure 15. The lower platform 104 thus comprises a step on each side of upper platform 106. Posts 92, 94 may also function as handle members. In accordance with another aspect of this invention, means are provided for the full or continuous simulation of climbing which would involve the user performing a continuous forward leg motion as in walking, running or cycling. Such devices for continuous climbing would employ, but not be limited to various current popular resistance mechanisms, such as hydraulic, pneumatic, Universal , 11Nautilis , resistance screws, friction brakes, tension springs, pulley and weights, etc. In general such con tenuous forward motion is accomplished by providing movable steps which move either vertically or in a circular direction. Figures 17 19 show one form of device 110 for achieving such continuous simulation of climbing. As indicated therein, a pair of A shaped frames 112, 114 are provided similar to the frame members of Figures 11 13.Thus the frame members are pivoted at their upper ends and include self adjusting feet 116. Each frame is provided with locking post 118 which is permanently secured to one of the frame members and adjustably secured to the other frame member by means of any suitable locking member 120. Thus the orientation or angulation of each frame may be selected and then the frame locked in place by actuation of locking member 120. In the embodiment of Figures 17 19, a pair of angularly adjustable steps 122, 124 are provided. As illustrated, each step includes a horizontal foot support member 126 which is mounted to a channel 128. Each channel is guided up and down a respective frame member 112 or 114.In use the user would step up with one foot on one of said steps thus causing the step to move downwardly. Resistance means are provided to urge the steps upwardly so that when the user steps with the other foot onto the other step, the first step is raised upwardly to its normal position.Figures 17 19 illustrate the resistance means in the form of a cord or cable 128 threaded over pulleys 130 around friction brake 132. As illustrated in Figure 18, if, for example, the user steps with his left foot on step 126, step 126 is moved downwardly from the position shown in full lines to the position shown in phantom. In the meantime, step 124 is pulled upwardly to the position shown in phantom. The user then shifts his weight so that the force is then applied on the right foot to step 124 and the reverse action takes place. In this manner, the user may continuously step in a forward direction while remaining at one location.Each frame also includes an upstanding hand grip 134 to provide balance to the user. With the device of Figures 17 19, it is thus possible to control the angle of climbing and to control the resistance offered by friction brake 132. These factors in combination with the user s weight controls the rate of climbing. The height of the steps 124, 126 is controlled by adjusting the length of the cable 128. Thus it is possible to achieve any desired simulation of climbing. In addition, a climbing program may take into account the user applying detachable weights to the users body as described in parent application Serial No. 388,881 to add a further degree of resistance. Figures 20 24 show other variations of the device described in Figures 17 19. In this respect, as shown inFigure 20, each step 136 of device 140 would have an individual cable attached to it at one end thereof with the other end of the cable having a weight 138 suspended therefrom. Adjustable stops 142 would be provided on each frame to limit the upward movement of steps 136. Stops 142 may be of any suitable form such as channel members disposed around each frame and selectively locked in position by fastener 144. Figure 21 shows a modification wherein the device 150 includes each step 152 mounted at the end of a hydraulic cylinder 154 so that the steps 152, 152 move up and down as the piston is extended away from or back into the cylinder. Figures 22 24 show a further variation of a device 160 which includes a center rod 162 spanning support rods 164. A pair of hydraulic cylinders 166 are suspended from center rod 162 with the respective steps 168 mounted to the pistons of the hydraulic cylinder assembly. As shown inFigure 24, the angle of the cylinder assemblies may be con trolled by any suitable locking arrangement. As illustrated in Figure 24, the locking arrangement includes intermeshing teeth formed between the cylinder assemblies and center rod 162 with relative rotation thereof prevented by actuation of locking member 170. Although various embodiments illustrate hydraulic cylinders, other means of extending and retracting a piston of vertically moving the steps may be used such as tension springs or the like. Figures 25 27 show yet another form of device 180 for achieving continuous simulation of climbing by providing vertically moving steps. As illustrated therein, device 180 includes a pair of movable ladders 182 slidably positioned in a channel framework 184 which in turn is secured in any suitable manner to a support member such as wall 186. The ladders 182 are interconnected by a cable 188 over a friction brake 190 in a manner similar to that described inFigures 17 19. The advantage of utilizing ladders 182 is that the user is presented with a number of different steps which may be used in the exercise. Figures 28 30 show yet another form of device 200 for providing continuous simulation of climbing by vertically movable steps. Device 200 in effect utilizes a pair of seesaws. As illustrated, device 200 includes a pair of planks 202 which pivot on frame 204. Frame 204 may take any suitable form and includes in the illustrated embodiment a pair of vertical posts 206 across which is mounted a shaft on which planks 202 are pivotally secured. Height adjustment may be achieved by elevating or lowering posts 206 and then locking the posts in position by means, for example, of a pin 210 engaged in a selective opening 212 in each respective post 206. Resistance to the downward application of force by the user stepping on planks 202 is provided in any suitable manner such as by springs 214 reacting between each plank 202 and a baseboard 216 which comprises the bottom member of support 204.Although not illustrated, planks 202 may include a plurality of mounting brackets for selective attachment of the planks with the fulcurm provided at shaft 208 so that the lever arm on each side of the fulcrum may be varied. As illustrated in Figure 30, non skid surfaces 218 are provided on each plank 202. In use of the device 200 of Figures 28 30, the user would place his weight on one step or plank 202. As that plank 202 falls toward base member 261 in opposition to the force provided about resistance member 214, the user would step on the other plank 202 and the first plank would be returned to its original upward position. The cycle would be repeated until the desired climbing exercise is achieved. The various devices described in connection withFigures 17 30 represent forms of continuous simulation of climbing wherein individual sets of steps are provided which move up and down in a generally vertical direction.The concepts of this invention, however, may also be practiced wherein the steps rotate or move in a completely closed loop direction so as to provide full or continuous simulation of climbing. Figures 31 33 illustrate one such form of device 220 which utilizes the concept of steps moving in a completely circular direction. In this embodiment a frame 222 similar to a stationary bicycle is utilized. The cycle climber 220, however, differs from a stationary bicycle in that steps are substituted for pedals, a balance post replaces handle bars and a seat is completely omitted. More specifically self leveling steps 224 are suspended from each end of shaft 226. Additionally the forward end of framework 222 is a T shaped balance post 228. In use the user would stand fully erect bearing all of his weight on steps 224 and without the user s arms bearing any weight.Step arms 230 are secured tc shaft 226 in a telescopic manner or in any other suitable manner to provide height adjustment of steps 224. If desired, some form of resistance means may also be provided at shaft 226 to resist the downward stepping action of the user on each step 224. The concept of individual steps which move in a completely circular direction may be achieved in other members such as by including a plurality of sets of steps.This might be accomplished, for example, by mounting such sets of steps to a circular frame with the steps being self leveling much along the lines of a ferris wheel. Figures 34 36 illustrate a variation of the invention wherein a single step is provided which rotates a full cycle during use thereof. In this form of the invention, device 240 may be considered a modified treadmill climber. Device 240 may include a generally standard walker jogger treadmill 242 which has a flexible surface 244 rotating about shafts 246. At the forward end of treadmill 242, and upstanding hand rail 248 is provided to provide balance to the user. Device 240 also includes a frame 250 for adjustably elevating the forward end of treadmill 242. Any suitable means may be utilized to accomplish the desired elevation effect. In the illustrated form frame 250 comprises a base member 252 having a telescopic assembly 254 pivotally mounted at the forward end of base 252.The telescopic assembly 254 may take various forms including a piston cylinder assembly, sets of sliding bars, an elevation screw or any other adjustable height frame. The upper end of telescopic assembly 254 has connected thereto support frame 256 which is connected at its lower end to base 252. Support frame 256 is also adjustable in length to accommodate the length adjustments of telescopic assembly 254. A bracket assembly 258 is secured on support frame 256 and treadmill 242 is mounted to a bracket 258 in any suitable manner. Bracket assembly 258 may be secured to support frame 256 at various locations in any suitable manner such as by means of fasteners engaged in selective holes 260. A shaft 262 spans brackets 258 and brackets 264 are slidably mounted on shaft 262. Treadmill 242 is detachably mounted to brackets 264.Because of their slidable mounting, brackets 264 may be laterally adjusted to add a further degree of adjustment to the location of treadmill 242. By proper adjustment of telescopic member 254 and support frame 256 as well as brackets 258 various heights may be achieved for treadmill 242 to thereby control the angle at which the user would climb treadmill 242. Although not illustrated, treadmill 242 may also include an adjustment screw or other suitable means to control the rotation speed of the roller belt 244 to provide yet a further controlled variable in the climbing exercise. The present invention is particularly advantageous since it lends itself in a most convenient manner to adaptation in the growing search for the most complete and effective exercise. There has been a trend to provide the most aerobic exercise and conditioning in the least amount of time. The use of weights and resistance mechanisms has been promoted for the normally unused portions of the body or to add additional load on the utilized parts of the body.The use of dumbbells, ankle weights, pulleys, etc. has been advocated in conjunction with traditional forms of exercise such as walking, running, trampolining, dancing, etc. The advantage of this combined exercise is that both the arms and the legs are worked at the same time. Climbing is ideally suited for such combined exercise since the use of additional weights does not produce added shock as in other activities. A new and highly desirable form of total exercise resistance climbing is made possible by the various simulated climbing devices of this invention wherein the user also can use various weights or resistance mechanisms for the upper body particularly the arms while performing the climbing exercise. The climbing apparati of this invention are ideally suited for use in conjunction with a load factor.The use of a wide step instead of rungs, pedals, etc. allows leg balance and thus frees the arms for additional work. Figures 37 38 illustrate an attachable resistance pulley to exercise the arms while a person is at the same time climbing. As shown in Figures 37 38 device 270 is formed along generally the same principles as device 10 of Figures 1 3. Device 270, however, includes a hand grip bar 272 mounted to one end of a cable 274 over a pulley 276 which is secured to upstanding post 26A. Post 26A in turn is detachably mounted to the frame by brackets 273. Attached to the opposite end of cable 274 is a weight 278. In use of the device 270 the user would hold hand grip bar 272 to overcome the resistance of weight 278 while the user is stepping onto step 24A. The resistance afforded by weight 278 can be varied by simply changing the particular weight which is added to cable 274. Figures 37 38 particularly illustrate the concept of resistance climbing in connection with a specific form of this invention, namely one of the devices for the partial simulation of climbing. It is to be understood, however, that the concept of resistance climbing is equally applicable to other forms of both partial simulation of climbing and full or continuous simulation of climbing.Similarly, although Figures 37 38 illustrate one form of adjustable resistance means for exercising the arms. Other forms of resistance mechanisms such as previously described may be employed within the concepts of this invention. Figures 39 42 illustrate an exercising device 300 which is based upon a step ladder principle. Device 300 this includes a frame in the form of a pair of side support units 302, 304. Each side support unit comprises a narrow rear leg 306 and a widened front leg 308. The legs are interconnected by a hinge mechanism 310 as is known in the step ladder art. The tops of the legs are interconnected by a bridge member 312 which may be an invertedL shape metal member. The steps of side units 302, 304 in turn are interconnected by rod 314 at their upper ends thereof as best shown in Figure 39. The front legs 308 of each side unit are provided with a plurality of grooves 316 which are aligned with each other in the respective pair of front members. For stability, a plate 318 may be inserted in the lowermost pair of grooves and permanently affixed thereto as shown in Figure 39.Angle supports 320 may also secure plate 318 to the front legs 308. The rear 306 may also be interconnected by rod 322. In accordance with this invention, a removable platform 324 is provided for selectively fitting in any suitable set of grooves in front legs 308. The specific set of grooves would be selected in accordance with the desired exercising program to achieve the proper height adjustment. The top of platform 324 may be provided with a non skid surface 326. If desired, device 300 may also include post 328 secured by any suitable fasteners 330 to provide a hand grip member for the user to facilitate the up and down stepping. Figure 42 shows device 300 during conditions of non use. As indicated therein hinge 310 is moved from its locking condition so that the legs 308, 306 are drawn toward each other. Platform 324 and hand support 328 may be detached and placed in any suitable position so that the device would assume a compact form. If desired the various components may then be conveniently stored and or transported in a housing 322. Figures 43 45 show an alternative form of device 340. As indicated therein, a pair of side units 342 are provided. Each side unit 342 comprises a pair of crossed legs which are pivoted at their lower ends to U shaped feet 344. At the point of intersection of legs 342, each leg is provided with elongated slots 346. A fastener 348 extends through slots 346. A support plate 350 connects the sets of legs 342 to each other and is secured thereto by fasteners 352 onto sliding mounts 354. Each sliding mount has a U shaped section for sliding up and down the respective legs 342. A locking member 356 is provided for each leg to fix support plate 350 in place. A vertically adjustable platform 358 is also provided with its sliding mounts 360 and fasteners 362. Legs 342 include a plurality of holes 364 into which the locking members 366 may be inserted, to lock platform 358 in its desired position. In the preferred form of this invention, fixed support 350 would be associated with only one set of holes in that it is not necessary for support 350 to be vertically adjustable. Platform 358, however, is provided with a plurality of sets of holes to provide the necessary height adjustment. In addition, device 340 permits the height adjustment by making it possible to vary the angle of legs 342 through the use of slots 346 and fasteners 348 when the vertical position of platform 358 is altered. Figures 46 47 show another form of this invention wherein the device 370 includes only a single platform 372 and omits the fixed platform as in the device of Figures 5 7.Device 370 includes leveler ends 374 at the end of each leg 376. Legs 376 and slots 378 and fasteners 380 are similar to device 340. A difference, however, is that platform 372 includes oversize bores 382 to permit platform 372 to be slid to the desired height then locked at that height by actuating fasteners 380 so that the lower edges of bores 382 contact legs 376 and are prevented from downward movement. Figures 48 49 show yet another form of this invention wherein device 390 includes a frame in the form of pairs of inverted V members having legs 392 secured at their upper ends thereof. A bridging support 394 interconnects the legs 392 of each set. The front legs of each set include sets of holes 396. The vertically movable platform 398 would be placed at the desired location and then supported theeon by support rods 400 inserted through the appropriate sets of holes 396. A post 402 is also optionally provided. Figures 51 53 show a further variation of device 410 which is formed similar to the device 300. In this form of the invention, however, grooves 412 are made very narrow as being formed by saw cuts which would provide a quick and convenient manner of manufacture. Platform 414 includes tongues 416 which may be integral therewith or separate insets such as metal members which may be inserted into saw cuts made in opposite sides of platform 414. Thus inserts 416 provide a convenient manner of mounting platform 414 at any desired height in the proper set of grooves 416.Barrel bolts 418 may also be provided to hold platform 414 in place. Since device 410 is otherwise formed similarly to device 300, like reference numerals have been used for like parts. Figures 54 55 show a device 420 similar to device 300, and thus like parts have like numerals. Device 420 differs from the device 300 in that rear legs 306 are hinged directly to front legs 308. In addition device 420 omits a fixed support such as support 318. Instead rods or dowels 422 may be provided a the bottom of device 420 with dowel or rod 424 at the top thereof. Lower dowels 422 may have angled braces 426. In the device 420 saw cuts 428 are utilized, and platform 430 is illustrated as having integral inserts 432 although, of course, separate inserts may be used.Dowel 424 has the multiple functions of providing a pivot joint for legs 306, 308 and providing a support which joins the sets of legs together as well as providing a carrier handle for the device. Figures 56 57 show device 440 which includes a pair of posts 442 each of which is mounted to a support member 444. Posts 442 include sets of holes 446. Adjustable platform 448 is mounted on slide members 450 and locked in place by pins or locking members 452 inserted through appropriate sets of holes 446. As shown in Figure 18, one of the posts 442 may be hollow so that a handle or post 454 may be inserted therein and locked in place by fastener 456. Figure 58 shows yet another form of device 460 which is constructed in the manner of an ironing board wherein the legs 462 have self leveling feet 464 with platform 466 mounted to the top of legs 462. An adjustable mechanism 468 is provided along the fashion in an ironing board with slots 470 slidably receiving pins 472 in one pair of legs 462 with the other pair of legs being pivotally connected to platform 466. Height adjustment would be achieved by moving the appropriate pair of legs in the slots 470 of adjustable mechanism 468 much in the same manner as an ironing board. In addition to providing various ways for the partial simulation of climbing, the invention further includes the continuous simulation of climbing such as by use of the various devices illustrated in Figures 17 30. In general, however, the various devices include, for example, steps which move downwardly in response to the user s weight with adjustable resisting means provided to resist the downward movement. In practice, the user would place one foot on one of a pair of generally side by side steps, and the user s weight would then cause that step to overcome the resisting means and lower the step. The user would then shift his weight by placing his other foot on the other step.The first step would then return to its normal position as the second step is lowered. The user would then again place his first foot on the first step, and the shift in weight would lower the first step and raise the second step.This shift in weight from one step to another would be repeated with the effect being that of the user continuously climbing in the same direction. This differs from the partial simulation of climbing wherein the user would be stepping backwards off, for example, a single platform. Another variation of the continuous simulation of climbing would be to provide steps which move in a closed loop. This form of practice could include individual steps for each foot or a single step which itself moves in a closed loop. It should be appreciated that the present invention is directed to the exercise of simulating climbing. The devices used herein may incorporate techniques used in other fields such as step ladders and ironing boards. The structure, however, while incorporating some of those techniques, deviates from the precise structure in these other fields.When compared to step ladders, for example, the devices with which the invention is concerned would use platforms generally widen than steps of ladders since it is intended that the platforms of the inventive devices be sufficiently wide to support a foot in the normal climbing fashion. Additionally, in the preferred form of this invention, only a single adjustable step is necessary whereas step ladders generally include a plurality of steps. Except as may be stated in any claim, however, it is to be understood that the invention may utilize devices having plural steps. As can be appreciated, the climbing apparati of this invention thereby provide progressive exercise devices.Such use of the invention results in a superior form of exercise because it involves a natural motion, the hands are free allowing for total exercise, high aerobic value results, there is no shock since the shock of added weight is not enhanced such as in other forms of exercise running, jumping, dancing , there is a high degree of safety because of the controlled motion, and the devices are convenient and affordable to the general public.
