# Voltage comparator circuit.

## Abstract
The comparator circuit of the invention is provided with a bias voltage generating section 2 which produces a bias voltage corresponded to an output voltage of a differential amplifier section. The bias voltage of the bias voltage generating section 2 is applied to the load elements Q3, Q5, ... Qn of a linear amplifier section, which have the same characteristic respectively. On the other hand the output voltage from the differential amplifier section 1 is converted into DC operating point voltage of the linear amplifier section 3 , which is applied to the drive elements Q4, Q6, ... Qn 1 of which characteristics are same each other.
