# Pipe couplers.

## Abstract
Rings of shape memory metal are deformed to be insertable between coaxial and overlapping surfaces of a conduit and a coupler so that upon heating above their transition temperature, the rings attempt to return to their undeformed shape and seal the opening between the two surfaces the sealing rings being concave convex with the convex surface directed toward the adjacent end of the conduit whereby interval pressure in the conduit tends to further expand the metal and increase the seal. Retainer rings in the general form of the section of a conic may be employed to provide additional strength against separation.
