A hearing protecting device comprises a shell 1 defining a hollow enclosure, which may be provided with sound absorbing material 6 , with an open mouth 2 , which is, in use, placed over the ear. A resiliently deformable seal 7 of sound absorbing material is provided along the periphery of the open mouth 2 to seal against the shell 1 and the wearer, and is releasably retained in place by releasable retaining means 14 15 which cooperate with an inner portion of the sealing means 7 and with an inner edge portion of the mouth 2 of the enclosure. The retaining means 14 15 may com prise an annular member 14 made integral with the sealing means 7 and which extends round the inner edge of the mouth 2 to overlie and engage an inner surface of the shell 1 , or a member 15 separate from the sealing member means 7 which retains an inner portion 10a of the sealing means 7 relative to the inner edge of the shell 1 .
