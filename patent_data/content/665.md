# Rhodium recovery from hydroformylation still heel with triaryl phosphate ligand.

## Abstract
A process for recovering rhodium present in a still heel from the hydroformylation of an unsaturated hydrocarbon wherein rhodium and a triaryl phosphite ligand were used by a process comprising a pretreating the still heel with a compatible organic solvent, at least 5 ml of water per 100 g of still heel, oxygen gas or a precursor thereof and sufficient base to produce a pH of 2 to 7 in the reaction mixture after rhodium precipitation b heating to a temperature of from 0 to 80 C to oxidize the triaryl phosphite ligand to the corresponding phosphate compound c heating the mixture from b for from about 15 minutes to about 120 minutes at about 115 C to about 175 C to precipitate the rhodium and optionally purifying the rhodium from c by d separating the rhodium precipitate e washing the rhodium precipitate with a solvent acid solution at a pH of 3 to 4 f treating the rhodium precipitate with an alkaline reducing solution to reduce the trivalent rhodium impurity to zero valent rhodium g quenching the rhodium with glacial acetic acid h separating the rhodium i washing the rhodium with an acid solution at a pH of 3 to 4 j drying the rhodium in an inert atmosphere at from 250 to 400 C and k oxidizing the rhodium at a temperature of from 300 to 900 C to convert the rhodium to Rn₂O₃.
