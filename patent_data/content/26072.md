# A generator of high current pulses.

## Abstract
A circuit for pulsing the output of a dc power supply 2 connected across a load such as a welding arc. The circuit has a first SCR 12 connected in parallel with a resistor 14 . The SCR 12 controls the pulse current and the resistor 14 con trols the background current. Each pulse is terminated by the action of a second SCR 18 and a capacitor 16 connected across the first SCR 12 by applying a control pulse to the gate of a second SCR 18 . The capacitor 16 is charged by a power supply 20 and is connected by the second SCR 18 so that the first SCR 12 is reverse biased and hence is turned off to terminate the pulse. Immediately the first SCR 12 turns off, the capacitor 16 is charged in the opposite sense to the charge derived from the power supply 20 and this in turn causes the second SCR 18 to be reversed biased by conduc tion through the resistor 14 and turned off a short time after the first SCR 12 is turned off. The circuit permits control of individual pulses and pulse trains in accordance with varia tions in any of a range of external control variables.
