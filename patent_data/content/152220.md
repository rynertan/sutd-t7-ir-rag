# Hairpiece with simulated natural hairline front.

## Abstract
A hairpiece for simulating a natural hairline at the front of the head of a user comprises a flexible shape retaining foundation 20 constituted of a light weight lace mesh having a multitude of fine fibers crossing one another at intersections which are connected by ultrasonic welds 30 to strengthen the mesh to maintain and to retain a predeter mined shape which conforms to the contour of the scalp area to be covered. A multitude of hairs 26 is attached to the mesh substantially all the way up to a non frayable unbound front edge 22 thereof where the hairs are vertically self standing and the scalp is viewable through the mesh apertures. The hair attached foundation mesh is detachably secured to the scalp area, and the line of attached hair at the front of the mesh is reliably positioned on the front of the head of the user to simulate a natural hairline thereat.
