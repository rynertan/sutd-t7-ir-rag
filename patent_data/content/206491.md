# Control of cigarette rod formation.

## Abstract
Tobacco trimmed from a filler rod 14 is recycled and used in the control of the rod forming operation. A reservoir vessel 28 is divided into physically separate chambers, 30, 32 a narrow one 32 of which receives the recycled trimmed tobacco and a wider one 30 of which receives cut tobacco. Tobacco is simultaneously fed from both chambers by a common feeding device 56 to form a metered flow from which the filler rod is ultimately formed. The level of to bacco in the narrow chamber is sensed and the operation of the common feeding device is controlled in response to sensed levels outside a predetermined range. If the sensed level is too high, then the tobacco is being fed too fast to the rod formation and the common feeding device then is slowed down, thereby slowing the tobacco feed rate, while, if the sensed level is too low, then the tobacco is being fed too slowly to the rod formation and the common feeding de vice then is speeded up, thereby speeding up the tobacco feed rate.
