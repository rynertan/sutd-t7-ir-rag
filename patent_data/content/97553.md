# HYDROPHILIC MEMBRANE OXYGEN SENSOR

## Abstract
An oxygen sensor having an anode 18 and a cathode 16 spatially separated by a thin structurally rigid hyrophilic membrane 12 . The hydrophilic membrane 12 is the host for a liquid electrolyte and confines the liquid electrolyte within the region between and in physical contact with anode 18 and cathode 16 . An oxygen permeable mem brane 24 disposed over the cathode 16 controls the quantity of oxygen reaching the cathode 16 and inhibits the evaporation of the liquid electrolyte.
