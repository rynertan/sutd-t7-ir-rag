# Light source.

## Abstract
A light source for a high resolution projection lithogra phy system comprises a laser 10 and transforming optical apparatus which transforms the laser source into an optically equivalent self luminous curved line source. The transform ing optical apparatus comprises a two dimensional array 20 of fly s eye lenses positioned to intercept a collimated parallel beam of light from the laser source and to produce a series of point or small area sources having a selected numerical aperture. An optical fibre array 22 is positioned so that the input end of each fibre receives the light output from one of the lenses in the array. The position of the input end of each fibre is chosen so that light from the illuminating lens underfills the fibre end to preserve the numerical aperture. The output ends of the fibres are arranged in position to produce a curved line source of a desired shape, e.g a quarter of an annulus. Alternate embodiments are described in which different lens arrays can be selectively positioned to change the numerical aperture of the transforming optical apparatus.
