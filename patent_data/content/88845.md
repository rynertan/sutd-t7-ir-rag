# LOW SHRINKAGE POLYMERS AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of a polymeric material that has a linear curing shrinkage of 1 or less involves mixing a liquid component containing, as its sole polymeris able constituent, one or more monomeric esters of general formula I The polymeric materials produced are particularly suit able for use in the formation of biomedical appliances, such as hearing aids, tooth filling, dental bridges and crowns, false teeth, artificial eyes and contact lenses, or for use in other biomedical applications, for example as a bone cement.
