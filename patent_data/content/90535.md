## Abstract
Electroluminescent panels and method of manufac ture. A method in which a phosphor film of manganese doped zinc chalcogenide is produced by chemical vapour deposition from alkyl zinc vapour and the gaseous hydride of the chalcogen. The manganese dopant is introduced uniformly during deposition by decomposition of tricar bonyl alkylcyclopentadienyl manganese The phosphor produced may be one of the following manganese doped compounds zinc sulphide, zinc selenide, zinc sulphur selenide, zinc oxy sulphide, zinc oxy selenide or zinc cadnium sulphide.
