# Pharmaceutical composition of phosphonomicin in tablet form.

## Abstract
A pharmaceutical composition with antibiotic activity in the form of tablets to be sucked , suitable for administration by slow dissolution in the mouth, contains a calcium salt of phos phomicine as the active constituent. A typical formulation com prises the equivalent of 0,25 to 1,0 g of phosphomicine in acid form together with excipients, sweeteners, flavouring agents, dispersants, etc. The said tablets, left to dissolve slowly in the mouth, allow higher, more constant and more lasting levels of the drug in the blood to be achieved.

## Description
Pharmaceutical composition of phosphomicine in tablet form The present invention relates to a new pharmaceutical composition with antibiotic activity for oral use and, more particularly, to a composition in the form of tablets containing the antibiotic phosphomicine as the active principle. Phosphomicine, or 1 cis 1 ,2 epoxypropyl phosphonic acid, is a known antibiotic with a wide spectrum of activity, which may be administered both parenterally, in the form of its sodium salt, and orally, usually in the form of its calcium salt. For oral administration, the calcium salt of phosphomicine has been used until now in the form of capsules or tablets to be swallowed or in the form of a suspension for paediatric use also to be swallowed .The capsules and tablets in general contain from 0.5 to 1.0 g of phosphomicine expressed as the acid while the paediatric suspensions contain 0.05 g ml of the active principle, again considered in the acid form. Daily doses for adults are usually 2 to 4g and for children 0.9 to 2.25 g, divided into doses administered at regular intervals of 6 to 8 hours. Although the pharmaceutical forms for oral administration known until know are more acceptable to patients than the forms for parenteral administration, they may not be used instead of the latter especially in more serious cases of infectious illnesses since it is known that the oral absorption of phosphomicine is limited about 60 is indeed eliminated unaltered in the faeces and the levels obtainable in the blood are thus rather low and of rather short duration. This obviously limits the oral use of phosphomicine to less serious forms of infection and also results in the need for frequent daily administrations in order to maintain minimum effective drug levels in the blood. The applicant, supposing that phosphomicine, by virtue of its small molecular dimensions, might have a good penetration index, even through the oral and oesophageal mucous membranes, which would be greater the longer the drug tissue contact time, has found that by formulating phosphomicine with pharmaceutically acceptable exci pients in tablets to be sucked, arranged to dissolve slowly in the mouth, achieves a quicker and better absorption and higher drug levels in the blood than those achievable with the oral forms used up to now.This gives substantial advantages to the oral use of phosphomicine in that it is possible, for example, to extend its use to more serious infections, while avoiding the inconveniences to the patients of parenteral administration and to achieve a local diffusion in the case of dental infections and infections in the oral cavity given the prolonged stay of the drug in the mouth, which advantageously enables the effects of its systemic action to be added to those of its local action.On the other hand, it is possible to produce equivalent results to those achieved with prior oral ftrins ath the use of snaller doses and or a reduction in the nutter of daily adnnistrations with the individual doses unchanged, while the use of the theEhanvseue formtuslprising tablets to be sucked, allows the possibility of extending its use even to children, given the facility with which it is taken. The tablets according to the present invention for sucking may be prepared with conventional formulations and by conventional methods, which produce tablets which can dissolve slowly in the oral cavity. According to the present invention, phosphomicine is preferably used in the form of its calcium salt. Each tablet to be sucked may contain from 0.25 to 1.0 g of phosphomicine expressed as the acid in addition to conventional excipi ents such as for example, saccharose, fructose, lactose sweeteners such as ammonium glycyrrhizinate, saccharine and sugar itself lubricants such as talc, magnesium stearate and the like dispersants such as lauryl sulphate, dioctyl sulphosuccinate or sodium lauryl sarcosinate and flavouring agents.A particularly preferred formulation includes, in addition to the phosphomic ine, saccharose, ammonium glycyrrhizinate, sodium lauryl sulphate, magnesium stearate, liquorice and mint in powder form. As mentioned above, the tablets of the present invention dissolve slowly in the mouth, so that the ingestion of the drug is slow and the contact times with the various mucous membranes and tissues are substantially long, which results in better and more continuous absorption. The present invention is now illustrated in more detail on the basis of several non limiting examples.Example 1 1428g of the calcium salt of phosphomicine corresponding to 1000 g of phosphomicine in acid form are formed into granules under moist conditions with 622g of saccharose in 66 aqueous solution and the moist granules are dried at 400C for one night. To the dry granules obtained are added 1 4g of ammonium glycyrrhizinate , 20g of powdered liquorice, 234g of powdered mint, 3.5g of sodium lauryl sulphate and 71g of magnesium stearate the mixture obtained Ms homogenized and precompressed. The compressed granules are powdered and passed through a 1 2 mesh sieve after which a further 12g of magnesium stearate areadded, and then the product is compressed to form tablets of the desired form, about 1000 tablets being obtained each with a weight of 2.345g and each containing 1g of phosphomicine, expressed in the form of the acid. Example 2 This is carried out subtantially as described in Example 1, the difference being that 714g of the calcium salt of phosphomicine are used instead of 1428g. Thus about 1000 tablets, each having an individual weight of 1.630g and each oontarning0.Sg of phosphomicine, expressed as the acid are obtained.Example 3 This is carried out in the manner described in example 1, the doses of the individual ingredients being reduced to a quarter thus about 1000 tablets each having an individual weight of 0586g and each containing 0.25g of phosphomicine, expressed in terms of the acid, are obtained. The tablets prepared according to the present invention, left to disolve slowly in the mouth, hav dissolution times normally between about half an hour and an hour and a half , depending on the weight of the tablet.
