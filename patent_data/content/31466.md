# Logic circuit.

## Abstract
A circuit provides either the J K logic function or the Exclusive Or EOR logic function depending upon a control signal. The circuit includes a conventional cross coupled EOR block 23 with two inputs 23b, 23c , the logic function being performed by the block depending on the presence or absence of the control signal g .
