# An aqueous composition, method of producing a water absorbent polymer, water absorbent polymer coated article and method of producing the same.

## Abstract
An aqueous composition of an acrylic polymer to which a water soluble peroxide radical initiator has been added, said initiator being adapted to decompose at a temperature of from about 40 C to about 180 C and act on the polymer to crosslink the same. Using the aqueous composition, a water absorbent crosslinked polymer and a water absor bent polymer coated article can be produced through sim plified processes. The water absorbent crosslinked polymer exhibits excellent water absorbing and swelling properties so that it can be advantageously utilized for the production of wet absorbent articles such as disposable diaper, sani tary napkin or the like. The water absorbent polymer coated article is excellent in water absorption properties and can be used safely for the purposes as mentioned above.
