# Rigid axle suspension system for a vehicle.

## Abstract
A vehicle having a rigid axle connected to the vehicle chassis by link assemblies each comprising a first link 24, 44, 50 connected at an end of the axle and an upper, second, link 25, 40, 51 pivoted at one end to the chassis, the other ends of the two links being pivoted together. Spring means 35 acts on the second link at a position to give a displacement of the spring means in roll of between 75 and 125 of its displacement in bump. The upper link may be triangulated in an assembly to provide for pivoting of its connection with the first link about an axis 33 inclined to the vehicle centre line.
