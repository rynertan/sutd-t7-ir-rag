# Coordination complexes as polyesterification catalysts.

## Abstract
The process and the catalyst used therein for producing polyesters and copolyesters, useful for making films and fibers, by the polycondensation of dicarboxylic acids and aliphatic glycols using coordinations complexes of metal halides and silicon compounds as catalysts.
