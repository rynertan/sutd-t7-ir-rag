FLOURINE DERIVATIVES OF VITAMIN D3 AND CELLDIFFERENTIATION INDUCING AGENTS CONTAINING THE SAME ASAN ACTIVE INGREDIENTTECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a novel fluorine derivative of vitamin D3. More particularly, it relates to a novel fluorine derivative of vitamin D3 which not only has an excellent pharmacological activity, namely a useful vitamin D like physiological activity, and is useful as a curative or preventive medicine for various diseases caused by disorders of transportation, absorption or metabolism of calcium, for example bone diseases such as rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis, but also has an ability to suppress the proliferation of tumor cells such as myeloleukemia cells and to induce the differentiation of these cells into normal cells, thus is useful as an antitumor agent, and further has an antirheumatic activity.PRIOR ART It is known t nat 1a, 25 dihydroxyvitamim D3 which is a metabolite of vitamin D3 in a living body and is known as the active form of vitamin D3, and its artificial homologues, la hydroxyvitamin D3, la, 24dihydroxyvitamim D3 and the like, exhibit an action of stimulating the absorption of calcium from the intestine and are effective as curatives for bone diseases and the like. Further, there has been found recently in vitamin D3 and its analogous compounds a differentiation inducing action to restore cancerated cells into normal cells. Actually, some of these compounds have been found to have an antitumor activity Y. Honma et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 80, 201 1983 , and is attracting attention. However, the results obtained so far are still unsatisfactory. On the other hand, among the other homologues of 26,26,26,27,27,27 Eexafluorovitamin D3 and its derivatives which are the objective compounds of this invention, 26,26,26,27,27,27 hexafluoro 25hydroxyvitamin D3 U.S. Patent No. 4,248,791 and 26,26,26,27,27,27 hexafluoro 1w, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 U.S. Patent No. 4,358,406 are known to have a high, vitamim D like physiological activity, and their effectiveness as an antitumor agent is disclosed inJapanese Patent Application Kokai Laid open No.7215 86. However, the vitamim D analogues of the abovementioned kind have, when used in medical treatment as antitumor agents or antirheumatic agents, a problem of side effect caused by their inherent vitamin D action, such as hypercalcemia, and hence are not yet used at present as practically useful curative agents. OBJECT OF THE INVENTION The object of this invention is to provide a 26,26,26,27,27,27 hexafluorovitamin D3 derivative which is a novel compound and has an excellent pharmacological activity. More particularly, the object of this invention is to provide a 26,26,26,27,27,27hexafluorovitamin D3 derivative which not only exhibits a useful vitamim D like physiological action, namely an action of stimulating the absorption of calcium from the intestine and the like action, and is useful as a curative agents for bone diseases and the like, but also, even in a low dosage in which the above mentioned vitamim D like physiological activity is not manifested, shows a powerful cell differentiation inducing action and is useful in the treatment of leukemia and the like as an anti tumor agent having a low degree of influence on the metabolism of calcium in a living body and a low toxicity, and further has an excellent antirheumatic activity.CONSTRUCTION AND EFFECT OF THE INVENTION The hexafluorovitamin D3 derivative provided according to this invention is represented by the formula IV EMI4.1 wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group or a protected hydroxyl group and R2 is a hydrogen atom or a protecting group. The compound wherein, in the abovementioned formula IV , R1 is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group and R2 is a hydrogen atom, namely the compound represented by the formula I1 EMI4.2 wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group, exhibits a vitamin D like action or a cell differentiation inducing action, and hence is useful as a curative or preventive medicine for bone diseases, or as a cell differentiation inducing agent or an antitumor agent.As specific examples of the compound represented by the formula tI , mention may be made of 26,26,26 hexafluoro ia hydroxyvitamin D3 compound A and 26,26,26 hexafluorovitamin D3 compound B . Further, the compound wherein, in the abovementioned formula IV3, R1 is a protected hydroxyl group or R2 is a protecting group, is useful as an intermediate for producing the compound represented by the above mentioned formula I . The above mentioned compound of the formula tIV according to this invention can be prepared by various methods known to the art as the method of preparing vitamin D3 and its analogues. A typical example of the methods will be described below. A cholesta 5,7 diene represented by the formula tIl EMI5.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above, is irradiated with ultraviolet light, and the resutling previtamin D3 derivative represented by the formula III EMI6.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above, is thermally isomerized to prepare the compound of this invention represented by the above mentioned formula IV .Further, the compound wherein, in the above mentioned formula III , R1 is a protected hydroxyl group or R2 is a protecting group, can be converted to the abovementioned compound of the formula I by subjecting the former to deprotection reaction. The protecting group referred to in this invention for R1 or R2 is used for the purpose of protecting a hydroxyl group in the above mentioned ultraviolet irradiation or thermal isomerization. Such protecting groups are not restricted specifically so long as they can achieve the said purpose. As typical examples thereof, mention may be made of acyl groups such as a formyl group, an alkanoyl group and an aromatic acyl group, alkyloxycarbonyl groups, and aralkyloxycarbonyl groups.Examples of alkanoyl groups include alkanoyl groups having 2 to 6 carbon atoms such as acetyl, chloroacetyl, propionyl and pivaloyl those of aromatic acyl groups include benzoyl groups optionally substituted with a nitro group, a halogen atom, an alkoxy group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as benzoyl, p nitrobenzoyl, o nitrobenzoyl, p chlorobenzoyl, ochlorobenzoyl, p methoxybenzoyl, o methoxybenzoyl, and p methylbenzoyl those of alkyloxycarbonyl groups include alkyloxycarbonyl groups having an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as ethoxycarbonyl those of aralkyloxycarbonyl groups include, for example, benzyloxycarbonyl groups whose phenyl group may be optionally substituted with a nitro group or a halogen atom, such as benzyl , p nitrobenzyl , o nitrobenzyl , p chlorobenzyl and o chlorobenzyl oxycarbonyl. Particularly preferred examples of protecting groups include an acetyl group and a benzoyl group. In the above mentioned method, the step of ultraviolet irradiation is carried out by irradiating a compound represented by the general formula II with ultraviolet light in a suitable inert solvent, for example organic solvents such as benzene, toluene, methanol, ethanol, n hexane and diethyl ether or a mixture thereof and in an atmosphere of inert gas such as nitrogen and argon. The source of ultraviolet light may be those conventionally used, including, for example, a mercury lamp as an easily available one. A filter may be used together according to necessity. An irradiation temperature of 10 to 400C, preferably 10 to 20 C, gives good results.Although the irradiation time varies depending on the kind of ultraviolet source, the concentration of the starting compound of the formula and the kind of solvents, it is usually several to several tens of minutes. The previtamin D3 derivative represented by the general formula III formed by the above mentioned ultraviolet irradiation may be isolated by subjecting a crude product obtained after distilling off the solvent from the reaction mixture to a conventional separation procedure such as chromatography. However, it is also possible to carry out thermal isomerization by heating the reaction mixture without isolating the previtamin D3 derivative of the formula III after the completion of the ultraviolet irradiated reaction. Thus, thermal isomerization is conducted by heating the reaction mixture, after the irradiation of ultraviolet light, at 20 to 1200C, preferably 50 to 100 C, for about 2 to 5 hours. This reaction is preferably carried out in an inert gas such as nitrogen and argon.The isolation of the compound of the formula IV from the reaction mixture is effected, after the solvent has been evaporated off, by conventional methods of separation such as chromatography. When the compound of the formula IV1 thus obtained is in a protected form, namely R1 is a protected hydroxyl group or R2 is a protecting group, it may be subjected to a deprotection reaction to be converted into the 26,26,26,27,27,27 hexafluorovitaminD3 derivative having the formula I . The deprotection of the hydroxyl group may be effected by using a reaction known per se. For example, the compound in a protected form may be treated in an alkaline solution of a lower aliphatic alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, or treated in a solvent such as ether or tetrahydrofuran with a metal hydride complex such as lithium aluminum hydride. The reaction temperature for these deacylations may be 20 to 500C in every case. Usually, room temperature is satisfactorily used. Thus, the intended compound of the formula I of this invention is obtained. The starting compound of the formula II may be prepared by using a prior art process known as the method of preparing cholesta 5,7 dienes, but it can advantageously prepared according to the method described below, for example. As a specific example, a method of preparation will be illustrated below for a compound of the formula IIa , a compound wherein R1 and R2 in the general formula I are an acetoxy group OAc and an acetyl group Ac , respectively, and for a compound of the formula IIb , a compound wherein R1 andR2 in the said formula I are a hydroxyl group and a hydrogen atom, respectively.EMI10.1 First, la, 25 dihydroxy 26,26,26,27,27,27hexafluorocholesterol V obtained by the method described in U.S. Patent No. 4,358,406 or JapaneseNational Publication ohio No. 500864 84 is treated by a method known per se, for example treated with acetic anhydride in pyridine, to obtain its 1,3 diacetate VI .The dehydration of the compound VI proceeds in approximately quantitative yield when it is heated together with triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrachloride in a suitable inert solvent at 50 to 1000C, to give the compound VII . Then, the compound VII is hydrogenated by the use of conventional hydrogenation catalysts such as palladium to give the compound VIII .The latter is then brominated by a known method, for example with N bromosuccinic imide or 1,3 dibromo 5,5 dimethyahydantoin, and then subjected to dehydrobromination by using a base such as s collidine, to give the 5,7 diene compound tIa . The compound IIa thus obtained can be converted as desired into the compound IIb by deacetylation according to a method known per se, for example hydrolysis under alkaline conditions or hydrogenation with a metal hydride complex such as lithium aluminum hydride. The compound wherein R1 in the general formula II is a hydrogen atom can also be prepared similarly.Namely, the compound represented by the general formula II wherein the la position is occupied by a hydrogen atom can be obtained by using 25,26,26,27,27,27 hexafluoro 25 hydroxycholesterol in place of the abovementioned starting material represented by the formula V and treating it through substantially the same reaction route as that described above. The compound I thus obtained is administered either parenterally, for example injected intramuscular ly, subcutaneously or intravenously or applied as ointment, or orally.
