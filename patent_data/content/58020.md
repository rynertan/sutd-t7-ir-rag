# Endoscopes.

## Abstract
A hard endoscope with inbuilt eccentricity correcting means for adjusting an eyepiece 19 on which a camera may be fitted by an adaptor engaging thereon, so that the interior of a body cavity in which the endoscope is inserted can be observed and recorded. When a camera is fitted to a hard endoscope eyepiece part 19 , if the optical axis of the endoscope and the optical axis of the camera do not coincide loss of image portions may result due to deflection of the image G in the camera. Therefore, the several embodi ments of endoscope described each have the eyepiece 19 itself provided with eccentricity correcting means 33, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 19 which can be adjusted to centre the optical axis of the hard endoscope to coincide with the outer periphery of the eyepiece, and thus the optical axis of the camera to minimise or eliminate the above mentioned eccentricity, the correcting means then being clamped to set the relative positions.
