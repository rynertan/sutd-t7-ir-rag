# A photographic material splicer.

## Abstract
An automatic splicer 10 is provided which is coupled to a continuous running processor 14 . Short strips of roll film 12 are inserted into the splicer 10 and are automatically spliced together as they are advanced through the splicer 10 . When no film is ready to be processed a leader 56 is automatically spliced to the last roll of film 12 to be processed. When the last roll 12 of film is passed through the processor 14 , the system may be placed on standby or stopped. Electronic control circuitry 100 senses by sensing switches LS 1 in dancing roll take up station 13 when no more film is available for processing and energises leader paper drive rolls 57, 58 to drive leader paper 56 to the trailing edge of the last film 12 between splicer blocks 26, 27 . The control circuitry 100 controls a film drive motor 61 , a splicer tape drive motor 70 , a leader knife relay 71 , and a splicer motor 69 . Film 12 is sensed by the control circuitry 100 by means of a set 83 of photocells S 1,S 2, S 3, S 4, S 5 between input feed rolls 17, 18 and pinch rolls 21 .
