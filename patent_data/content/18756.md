# Speed independent arbiter switch for digital communication networks.

## Abstract
A speed independent arbitration switch designed for pipelined message transmission through digital communication networks. The arbiter routes a message from one of two input paths to the output path and appends a bit to the message indicating the input path. When requests are present on both input paths, the arbiter accepts messages from them alternately, choosing the first randomly if the requests arrive simultaneously.
