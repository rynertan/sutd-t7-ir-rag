# Method and apparatus for the recovery of hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for recovering hydrocarbons in which a first torroidal vortex of fuel and a combustion support ing gas is created with its center adjacent the axis of an elon gated combustor a second torroidal vortex of combustion supporting gas is generated between the first torroidal vortex the fuel is burned in the presence of the combustion support ing gas to produce a flue gas at the downstream end of the combustor water is introduced into the flue gas adjacent the downstream end of the combustor to produce a mixture of flue gas and water a major portion of the water is vaporized in a va porizor to produce a mixture of flue gas and steam and the mixture of flue gas and steam is injected into a hydrocarbon bearing formation.
