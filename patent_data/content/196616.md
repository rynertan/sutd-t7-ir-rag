# LOGIC CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A logic circuit in accordance with the present invention comprises a first inverter circuit 22 for inverting a signal that is inputted to its input terminal a second inverter circuit 24 for inverting the signal that is inverted by said first inverter circuit a first type first bipolar transistor 42 whose base is connected to either of said first inverter circuit and said second inversion circuit, whose collector is connected to a first power supply terminal 32 , and whose emitter is connected to the output terminal of the logic circuit and a first type second bipolar transistor 44 whose base is connected to the other of the first inversion circuit and the second inverter circuit, whose collector is connected to the output terminal, and whose emitter is connected to a second power supply terminal 34 .
