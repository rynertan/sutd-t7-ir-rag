Detailed Description of the Invention The present invention relates to a method of preparing a aryialkanoic esters. In accordance with this method, the a arylalkanoic esters are prepared by reacting a trivalent iodine compound with a carbonyl compound in the presence of an orthocarboxylic ester.Applicants have discovered that by conducting this reaction in the presence of one or more selected solvents, the amount of orthocarboxylic ester required for the reaction is decreased, thus improving the economies of the reaction process. Bs the methods of this .invention, o arylalkanoic esters represented by the general formulaEMI4.1 where rl is an aromatic hydrocarbon, R is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, R1 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, and R2 is an alkyl group, are prepared by reacting a trivalent iodine compound represented by the general formula EMI5.1 wherein Ar is an aromatic hydrocarbon, and X and Y are each a oroup eliminated as an anion, with a carbonyl compound represented by the general formula EMI5.2 where Arl, Rand RÚ are the same as defined above, in the presence of an orthocarboxyl ic ester represented by the general formula ZC ORê 3,, wherein R2 is an alkyl group and Z is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, in at least one solvent selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, lower aliphatic esters, lower aliphatic ethers, lower aliphatic nitriles, lower aliphatic alcohols, lower aliphatic acids and nitroparaffinSv In this reaction process Ar represents an aromatic hydrocarbon group, which may have one or more substituents on the aromatic ring. The substituant may be linear or branched alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, n or iso propyl, or n , iso , sec or t butyl group, an alkoxy group such as methoxy, ethoxy, n or iso propyloxy, or n , iso , sec or t butoxy group, an aryloxy group such as phenoxy, an acyloxy group such as acetoxy, n or iso proplonyloxy, n , iso , sec or t butyryloxy, or benzoyloxy group, or an electron attractive group such as a nitro, acetyl, propionyl, benzoyl, nitrile or sulfonyl group. ArÚ also represents an aromatic hydrocarbon group which optionally may carry a substituent on the aromatic ring. The substituent may be a saturated hydrocarbon group such as an alkyl group having 1 to about 4 carbon atoms an unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group such as vinyl, ethyl, or alkyl group, an alkenyl or alkenyloxy .5 group having such an unsaturated group an alkoxy group such as snethoxy, ethoxy, n or iso propyloxy, or n , iso , sec , or t butyloxy an alkylthio group such as methylthio, ethylthio, n or iso propylthio, or n , sec , iso or t butylthio group an arylthio group such as phenylthio an acryl group, such as phenyl a halogen atom or an amino group which is mono or di substituted by nor iso propyl, or n , iso , sec or t butyl group. The groups R and R1 may each independently represent an alkyl group, such as inethyl, ethyl or propyl, or a hydrogen atom. Preferably, the carbonyl compound is an acetophenone or propiophenone, the phenyl group of which optionally is substituted with an alkyl group, halogen or alkoxy group. The ratio of trivalent iodine compound to carbonyl compound desirably is at least 1 1 A desirable ratio is about 1.2 1. In trivalent iodine compoundsEMI6.1 X and Y are groups which can be eliminated as an anion and include, for example, acyloxy groups such as acetoxy, trif roacetoxy, benzoyloxy, chloro and fluoro. X and Y may be the same group or different groups and may include a combination of an acyloxy group as X and a hydroxy group as Y. The trivalent iodine compounds can be produced in accordance with procedures well known in the art. For example, if X and Y are chlorine atoms,EMI6.2 can be prepared b reacting an iodinated aromatic hydrocarbon,Ar I, with chlorine. If the dichloro trivalent iodine compound obtained is allowed to react with acetic acid, the chlorine can be replaced with an acetoxy group. In the same way other trivalent iodine compounds having other electronegative groups also can be produced. The reaction is carried out in the presence of an orthocarboxylic ester represented by the general formulaZC ORê 3. In this formula Z is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group and R2 is an alkyl group. Preferably, the compound is the methya, ethyl or propyl ester of ortho formic acid. Ethyl orthoformate is especially preferred in comparison to other orthocarboxylic esters in that it is the most economical.

In the exatrple of . rapanese Laid Open Patent Application 163,345, the molar ratio of orthocarboxylic ester to carbonyl compound was shown to be about 14 1. In accordance with the method of this invention, the molar ratio of orthocarboxylic ester to carbonyl compound can be as low as about 1 1 If desired, additional orthocarboxylic ester, sufficent to bring the amount to about three or more equivalents of the amount of carbonyl can be employed.Typically, no more than 6 8 equivalents of orthocarboxylic ester are needed to obtain high yield. of product. The solvent used in the present invention is selected from specific groups as mentioned above.examples of the solvents include linear or cyclic hydrocarbons having about 5 to about 7 carbon atoms, such as n hexane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, benzene and toluene linear or cyclic halogenated hydrocarbons having 1 to about Ç carbon atoms, such as chloroform, dichloromethane and chlorobenzene lower alkylesters such as methyl, ethyl and propyl esters of a fatty acid having 1 to about 3 carbon atoms, such as formic acid, acetic acid and propionic acid lower aliphatic ethers having about 2 to about 4 carbon atoms such as dimethyl ether, diethyl ether and methyl ethyl ether lower aliphatic nitriles, such as acetonitrile and propionitrile lower aliphatic alcohols having 1 to about 4 carbon acas, including methanol, ethanol, n or iso propanol, or t butanol lower fatty acids having 1 to about 3 carbon atoms, i.e., formic acid, acetic acid and propionic acid and nitroDaraffinshavng 1 to about 2 carbon atoms, such as nitromethane and nitroethane.

If solvent recovery is taken into consideration, use of a single solvent may be prefersble for ease of recovery of the reaction product In the present invention, beneficial results are obtained when the solvent is selected from the list set forth above.It has been found, however, as illustrated in the examples below, that if other solvents, such as a lower aliphatic ketone such as acetone, an amide of a lower fatty acid di substituted with lower alkyl groups such as din,ethyl form.amide, or lower dialykl sulfoxide such as dimethyl sulfoxide i. used as a solvents the reaction of the present invention will not proceed substantially and the reactant which remains unrencted will be recovered or the product will be resinifiod. The reaction of the present invention desirably is carried out under acid conditions as, for example, by adding concentrated sulfuric acid or other acid such as perchloric acid. The reaction may be carried out at room temperature. Alternatively, if desired, heat may be applied to raise the reaction ternperature up to about 80 C. Reaction time is dependent upon the carbonyl compound chosen as a reactant. The completion of the reaction can be determined by thin layer chromatography TLC by measuring for the disapperance of carbonyl compound. The a arylalkanoic ester produced by the reaction can be recovered from the reaction mixture in accordance with conventional methods.
