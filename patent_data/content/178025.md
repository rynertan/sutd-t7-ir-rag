# Mounting hard magnetic material permanent magnets.

## Abstract
A permanent magnet of a hard magnetic material, such as rare earth cobalt intermetallic compounds or AlNiCo, is joined to a mounting surface by way of intermediate layers. These layers avoid heating the magnet above the maximum service tempera ture of the magnetic material, and thus prevent losing the magnetic properties.
