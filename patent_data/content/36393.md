# Feeding device for pre sterilized objects contained in internally sterile receptacles, for sterile packing plants.

## Abstract
The device substantially comprises a chamber 1 within which a sterile atmosphere is created at a pressure slightly higher than the atmospheric pressure, which communicates, by means of a valve operated aperture 2 with a sterile envi ronment into which the objects are to be transferred. The receptacle 10 containing the objects is secured in corres pondence with a second aperture 3 in the chamber, a sterile atmosphere is created within the chamber, and the lid 10b of the receptacle is removed by mechanical means. The objects drop to the bottom of the chamber and by acting upon the valve, are transferred to the sterile environ ment.
