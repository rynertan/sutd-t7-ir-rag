# High density para aramid papers.

## Abstract
High density para aramid papers comprising 5 to 25 percent, by weight, binder and an amount of para aramid fibers selected from the group consisting of para aramid pulp, para aramid floc and mixtures thereof, compacted to provide a volume percent para aramid fiber of at least 53 minus 0.13 times the volume percent floc in the paper are useful in the preparation of circuit board substrates having a low coefficient of thermal expansion.
