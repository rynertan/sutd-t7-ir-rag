## Description
The present invention relates to an apparatus of the kind referred to in the preamble portion of claim 1. Such an apparatus is known from DE A 2613025 or DE A 2503978. Among radiographic methods applying an X ray CT apparatus, T R system was used, for instance, in an early stage, in which an X ray source and a detector were set opposite to each other with a subject held between them so as to conduct translational and rotational scanning in the first generation , as described in CT scanner , published in Deshikogaki Shinpo Series 9, Corona Sha. Thereafter, a T R II system in which a plurality of detectors and a somewhat expanded X ray source were employed for reducing the time required for radiography the second generation , and an R R system in which an X ray source and a plurality of detectors were turned simultaneously around a subject the third generation , were developed, and now, an S R system in which detectors are set stationary on the whole circumference of a radiographing region and an X ray source is rotated in the scanning direction while emitting X ray beams 4 into the entire scope of the radiographing region the fourth generation has been put to practical use. The X ray source stops rotation at a data sampling point set for radiographing and performs a radiographing operation at this point. It repeats the same operation along the rotational track of X ray source thereof, and the radiographing operation is stopped when the X ray source makes a round of the radiographing region. This system has an advantage that it enables a projection of high accuracy and high speed, since a mechanically movable member is provided only for rotating the X ray source. This system, however, has as disadvantage that the X ray beam cannot be collimated sufficiently by the detectors. This is because the detectors cannot be arranged closely to each other for structural reasons, and because each of them is directed not to the X ray source, but to the center of the radiographing region. Accordingly, the amount of detected X rays at the position of the detector is represented by polar coordinates in which the detected amount is presented in the radial direction. The path of the X ray beams is represented herein by a straight line connecting the position of the X ray source and the position of the detector. Consequently, the data on detected X rays are necessarily discrete to some degree, which results in a limited resolution of an image display. A second disadvantage due to the fact that X rays cannot be collimated sufficiently will be described hereunder. In general, a scintillator is used as detector. As for the detection sensitivity of the scintillator, however, only the evaluation thereof in the case when the incidence is vertical to the detecting surface of the scintillator is employed, and therefore, the evaluation of the detection sensitivity in the case when the incidence is oblique to the detecting surface of the scintillator is difficult. Moreover, the nonuniformity in the angular distribution of X ray beams is another cause of the difficulty in the evaluation of the detection sensitivity. Thus, it can be said that the method of X ray radiography applying the S R system aims a high speed radiography, but leads to a reduction of the density of radiographic data and to a sacrifice of the detection sensitivity of each detector to some degree. Prior art document GB A 15 64 309 discloses a cross sectional radiography imaging apparatus comprising a radiation source, a plurality of radiation detectors for detecting radiant rays emitted from said radiation source and transmitted through an object to be measured and for providing output signals indicative thereof, said radiation detectors being connected together for simultaneous movement, detector driving means for moving said radiation detectors, means for computing cross sectional imaging information on said object in response to the output signals from said radiation detectors, and means for displaying a cross sectional image of the object in accordance with the output of said computing means. This document further shows a sectional radiography imaging method comprising the following steps From Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 6, no. 168 P 139 1046 , September 2, 1982, a multichannel X ray detector is known which is moved together with an X ray source in a rotating matter in synchronism with each other and in the same direction centering around an object to be irradiated to collect X ray data on various directions in a section of the object. An object of the present invention is to furnish an improved sectional radiography display apparatus. This object is achieved with the apparatus, as claimed in claim 1. According to the present invention the radiation transmission distribution has a precision being two or more times that obtained with conventional methods which can be attained at less than half the cost that is needed for conventional methods so that an improvement in the image accuracy which has not been available heretofore can be obtained by a CT apparatus and the method according to the present invention.

The principle of the present invention will be described before the description of the embodiment with reference to drawings. To begin with, the disadvantages of the conventional way of taking the data on transmitted radioactive rays this S R system will be summed up. The present invention has been designed for eliminating the aforesaid two faults. Figure 1 shows an example in which one detector 2 opposed to a radiation source 12 and matched in the axis with the latter is subjected to swing scanning 13 conducted around the radiation source 12. A radiation beam 14 from the radiation source 12 is detected by the detector 2 subjected to said swing scanning 13 through every angle Δϑ fixed . If the radiation from the radiation source 12 were unidirectional, it would be necessary to turn the radiation source 12 through every angle Δϑ. In practice, however, it is unnecessary to turn the source in such a manner, since the radiation source 12 is generally isotropic in the direction of radiation except for an X ray tube 3. The exposure to the radiation can be reduced, by providing the radiation source 12 with a collimator 15 as shown in Figure 2 and by scanning through every angle Δϑ in synchronization with the detector 2. When the swing scanning 13 is conducted around the radiation source 12 by using the radiation source 12, the collimator 15 and the detector 2 constructed as stated above, the radiation beam 14 is transmitted on an axis connecting the detector 2 and the radiation source 12, and the distance between the detector 2 and the radiation source 12 is fixed irrespective of the position of detection. Consequently, the aforesaid problem 2 of the diversity in the thickness of the detected beam can be settled. However, the example of Fig. 1 in which one detector 2 is employed requires Figure 3 shows an example in which three detectors 2 are arranged on a circular arc at an interval of an angle ϑ around the radiation source 12. If the angle ϑ is set to be twice as large as the angle Δϑ, the time required for radiographing the same region can be reduced to 1 3 of that in the case of Fig. 1. Although scanning through every Δϑ is shown in Fig. 3, the angle Δϑ is divided into An examination of the size of one detector 2 makes it clear that detected data such as those obtained by a delta function with respect to a position X is satisfactory for the present purpose. When expressed by a formula, they can be represented in the following equation. where η X denotes the distribution of the detection sensitivity of the detector 2 and r X the distribution of the radiation transmission of a object 17, while δ X denotes a delta function and a 0 the detected intensity of radiation at X 0. A value a₀ is a proportion constant, and X₀ denotes the aperture of the detector 2. The efficiency of detection is generally reduced extremely as the size X₀ of the aperture of the detector 2 is decreased, and therefore, the size X₀ of the aperture can not be decreased. When the size X₀ of the aperture of the detector 2 is enlarged, a detection region is expanded, and thus the detected amount a 0 of radiation at X 0 is given in practice by the following equation as shown in Figure 5. Accordingly, necessary information r 0 is obscured by a value a 0 , and thus r 0 can not be extracted without any modification. When the equation 2 is rewritten with respect to X, the following equation is obtained. This is a convolution of the distribution η X of the sensitivity of the detector 2 and the distribution r X of the radiation transmission of the object 17. The distribution η X of the sensitivity of radiation detection and the detected intensity a X of radiation are the two amounts which can be observed solely according to the equation 3 . Therefore, when Fourier transformed values of the distribution η X of the sensitivity of radiation detection, the distribution a X of the detected intensity of radiations and the unknown distribution r X of the radiation transmission of the object 17 are denoted by H ω , A ω and R ω respectively, the equation 3 can be rewritten as follows Accordingly, the following equation can be obtained from the equation 4 . Thus, the unknown distribution r X of the radiation transmission of the object 17 can be determined from the following formula, which is obtained by applying the inverse Fourier transformation F ¹ to the equation 5 . The above stated procedures are illustrated in Figure 6. The object 17 having the distribution r X of the radiation transmission and the distribution t X of the thickness is held between the radiation source 12 and the detector 2, a translational scanning 18 is applied thereto, and thereby the distribution A X of the intensity thereof is measured. When the distribution η X of the sensitivity of the radiation detection of the detector 2 is known on the occasion, an estimated value r X of the distribution r X of the radiation transmission can be determined from the Fourier transformed value H ω of η X and the Fourier transformed value A ω of the distribution A X of the detected intensity, according to the formula 6 , and an estimated value t X of the distribution t X of the thickness can be determined therefrom. The values r X and t X are approximate because the distribution a X of the intensity detected by the detector 2 contains a noise component and thus the equation 3 is not valid in the strict sense of an equation. The above described procedures improve resolution even when the detector 2 has a large aperture. The application of these procedures to the method of detecting radiation shown in Figs. 3 and 4 enables the attainment of a sectional image of high resolution from radiations, and thus all the disadvantages of the S R system of the fourth generation can be settled. An embodiment of the present invention will be described hereunder with reference to Figure 7. Figure 7 shows a construction of the whole of an apparatus formed by applying a radiation measuring method of the present invention to a gamma ray CT apparatus. The main control unit 21 for controlling the whole of said apparatus and taking in the data on the radiation transmission is connected to a mechanical scan control unit 22, a radiation counter 27 and an image processing unit 28, and supplies said mechanical scan control unit 22 with a position control signal for scanning a radiation measuring table 37 and a detector scanning stage 38, supplying the radiation counter 27 with a count end signal, a reset signal and a count start signal, and further supplying the image processing unit 28 with a take in signal for taking in the result of a count after the count end signal is sent to the radiation counter 27, and a process start signal. The mechanical scan control unit 22 is connected to the main control unit 21, a detector scan control unit 23 and a rotational scan control unit 24, and divides the position control signal from the main control unit 21 into a detector scan signal and a rotational scan signal, supplying the detector scan control unit 23 and the rotational scan control unit 24 with the detector scan signal and the rotational scan signal respectively. The detector scan control unit 23 is connected to the mechanical scan control unit 22 and a pulse motor 25 for detector scanning, receiving the detector scan control signal from the mechanical scan control unit 22, converting same into a signal for driving the pulse motor, and sending it to said pulse motor 25. The rotational scan control unit 24 is connected to the mechanical scan control unit 22 and a pulse motor 26 for rotational scanning, receiving the rotational scan control signal from the mechanical scan control unit 22, converting same into a signal for driving the pulse motor, and sending it to the pulse motor 26. The pulse motor 26 for rotation scanning is connected to the rotational scan control unit 24, and rotates according to the pulse motor driving signal sent from the rotational scan control unit 24. The power of this pulse motor is transmitted to the radiation measuring table 37 connected thereto mechanically to make it conduct a rotating movement 36 arund an axis 34 of rotation. The radiation measuring table 37 is provided with a radiation source 40, the detector scanning stage 38 fitted with a plurality of radiation detectors 31, and the pulse motor 25 for detector scanning. This table is connected mechanically with the pulse motor 26 for rotational scanning, and is rotated around the axis 34 of rotation by the power of said pulse motor 26. Moreover, the radiation measuring table 37 is provided with an aperture 32 made therein so that it contains an inspection region 33. The detector scan control unit 23 is connected to the mechanical scan control unit 22 and the pulse motor 25 for detector scanning, receiving the detector scan control signal from the mechanical scan control unit 22, converting same into the pulse motor driving signal, and sending it to the pulse motor 25. This pulse motor 25 is provided on the radiation measuring table 37 and connected to the detector scan control unit 23, and rotates according to the pulse motor driving signal from the detector scan control unit 23. The power of said pulse motor 25 is transmitted to the detector scanning stage 38 to make it conduct a swinging movement 35 around an axis of swinging 30. On the detector scanning stage 38 three detectors 31 are provided so that the detecting surfaces thereof are directed to the axis 30 of swinging and that straight lines radiation beam paths 39 connecting the axis 30 of swinging with the radiation detectors 31 cover the entire inspection region 33. The radiation source 40 is provided in alignment with the axis 30 of swinging. Radioactive rays transmitted through the inspection region 33 are detected by the three radiation detectors 31 according to the rotating mouvement 36 of the radiation measuring table 37 and the swinging movement 35 of the detector scanning stage 38. The radiation detectors 31 are connected to the radiation counter 27 respectively, and supply the radiation counter 27 with data on detected radiations. The counter 27 is connected to the radiation detectors 31, the main control unit 21 and the image processing unit 28, receiving the radiation count end signal, the reset signal and the count start signal from the main control unit 21, and sending data on counted radiations to the image processing unit 28 based on the radiation count end signal. The image processing unit 28, connected to the main control unit 21, the radiation counter 27 and an image display unit 29, takes in the data on counted radiation from the radiation counter 27 based on a signal for taking in data on counted radiation, which is sent from the main control unit 21, and starts an image processing for image display based on an image processing start signal sent from the main control unit 21. After ending an operation of prescribed data, the image processing unit 28 sends the result of the operation to the image display unit 29. A signal for ending the operation of prescribed data is supplied from the main control unit 21. The image display unit 29, connected to the image processing unit 28, receives the result of the operation sent thereto after the end of the operation by the image processing unit 28, converts same into an image signal and thereby execute the image display. The following is a description on the functions of the above described units and components, which can be divided into two functions mechanical scanning and signal processing. First, a description will be made on a section of mechanical scanning. Figure 8 shows a structure of a radiation measuring apparatus which is an application of the present invention. The entire apparatus is installed on a frame 41, and the swing scanning and the rotational scanning are performed by the pulse motors. The frame 41 is fitted with a plurality of support wheels 49 by means of bearings 50 so that the rotating motion of the radiation measuring table 37 can be performed smoothly. These support wheels 49 rotate on rails 55 provided under the radiation measuring table 37, so as to rotate this table freely. Power to drive the radiation measuring table 37 is obtained from a pulse motor 54, which rotates in a prescribed manner based on a signal from the rotational scan control unit 24. This pulse motor 54 is connected to a reduction gear 53 for rotational scanning so that it can transmit a power thereto. The reduction gear 53 for rotational scanning is connected to a worm gear 52 for rotational scanning and can transmit a power thereto. This worm gear 52 for rotational scanning is combined with a gear 51 for rotational scanning so that the axes of rotational powers are made to intersect perpendicularly to each other, thereby the rotational power thereof being transmitted to a rotational gear 57. The rotational gear 57 engages with a gear 56 provided under the radiation measuring table 37 and thereby can transmit the power of the pulse motor 54 to this table 37. Next, a description will be made of the mechanism of the detector scanning stage 38. The detector scanning stage 38 is provided beneath with a plurality of wheels 58 for swing scanning, and these wheels 58 ride on rails 42 laid in the shape of an arc around the radiation source 40 on the radiation measuring table 37, so that the stage can conduct a swing movement around the radiation source 40. A power for this circular arc movement is given by the pulse motor 25, which rotates in a prescribed manner based on a signal from the detector scan control unit 23. This pulse motor 25 is connected to a reduction gear 43 for swing scanning and can transmit a power of rotation thereto. The reduction gear 43 for swing scanning is connected to a worm gear 44 for swing scanning and can transmit the power thereto. This worm gear 44 for swing scanning is combined with a gear 45 for swing scanning to make the axes of the rotational power intersect perpendicularly to each other so that the rotational power thereof can be transmitted to the gear 45 for swing scanning. This gear 45 engages a circular arc shaped gear 48 provided in the lower part of the detector scanning stage 38 and thereby can transmit the power of the pulse motor 25 to the detector scanning stage 38. The foregoing is the description on the mechanical scanning units and components. Next, a description will be made on signals for controlling these mechanical scanning units and components. Figure 9 shows the respective positional angle of four radiation detectors 31 in the case when swing scanning is performed by these radiation detectors 31. When an angular aperture containing an inspection region 33 with the swinging axis 30 of the detector scanning stage as the center is ϑ₀ and the whole of this angular aperture ϑ₀ is covered by using the four radiation detectors 31, the scanning angle Δϑ of the detector scanning stage 38 is ϑ₀ 4. It is found that a scanning angle Δϑ, required when when the swing scanning of Δϑ is conducted at a pitch ΔP. Figure 10 shows the relationship between swing scanning and rotational scanning, in which swing scanning angle ϑ and rotational scanning angle ψ are used. This means that the radiation measuring table 37 is rotated Δψ every time when the swing scanning of Δϑ is ended, and then a swing scanning of Δϑ is started. The foregoing is the description on the positional relationship between the radiation measuring table 37 and the detector scanning stage 38, and next a description will be made on signals supplied from the rotational scan control unit 24 and the detector scan control unit 23 to the respective pulse motors 54 and 25. Figure 11 shows positions of these units and control signals therefor. The figure shows a position signal for the radiation measuring table 37, pulse signals forward and backward signals from above downward given to the pulse motor 54 for driving the radiation measuring table 37, a position signal for the detector scanning stage 38, and pulse signals forward and backward signals from above downward given to the pulse motor 25 for driving the detector scanning stage 38. Such a train of pulse signals are supplied from the main control unit 21 through the mechanical scan control unit 22. Next, a description will be made of a section in which radiation count signals are supplied from a plurality of radiation detectors 31 provided on the detector scanning stage 38 to the radiation counter 27 and are not transferred therefrom to the image processing unit 28. The detector scanning stage 38 moves at the pitch of ΔP, stops for the time Δt and measures radiations during this time, while the radiation counter 27 is supplied with a count end signal, a transfer signal for transferring the number of counts to the image processing unit 28 and reset and count start signals from the main control unit 21. Time charts of these signals are shown in Figure 12. When the swing scanning of Δϑ is ended, an inverse Fourier transform operation start signal is sent from the main control unit 21 to the image processing unit 28, whereby an inverse Fourier transform operation is started. Figure 13 shows radiation count signals in which the symbol A ϑ denotes the distribution of radiation transmission which is obtained from the detection of the distribution t ϑ of radiation transmission within the inspection region 33 by the radiation detectors 31. Owing to the distribution of the detection sensitivity of the detectors 31, the former distribution is obscure in comparison with the latter distribution. Therefore, the former distribution is modified into data as shown in t ϑ by the inverse Fourier transform operation described previously, and the data thus obtained are stored in a memory in the image processing unit 28. Time charts of the position signal of the radiation measuring table 37, the inverse Fourier transform operation start signal and a CT operation start signal are shown in Figure 14. In the above described embodiment, inverse Fourier transform operation is conducted when each swing scanning is ended. The same effect can be produced also when said processing is conducted after all the mechanical scannings are ended.
