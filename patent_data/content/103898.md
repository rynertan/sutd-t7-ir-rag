## Description
NOVEL PEPTIDE AND USE THEREOF Field of the Invention This invention relates to novel polypeptides and use thereof. Background Art Hybridoma technology for the production of monoclonal antibodies, which was developed by Köhler and Milstein Nature, 256, 495 1975 , has recently come into frequent use. This technology has several marked features for instance, antibodies of a single specificity to each antigenic determinant can be produced, and antibodies obtained against roughly purified specimens need no absorption procedure.Moreover, from the viewpoint of antibody production, the technology is advantageous in many aspects, for instance in that when hybridomas are grown as ascites forms, high titer antibody specimens can be obtained as desired, in large amounts and with constant quality and good repro ducibility. In this sense, the utility of the technology of obtaining monoclonal antibodies by use of hybridoma is rated high. The modes of utilization of monoclonal antibodies are not limited to antigen detection. For instance, they are used for the purification of trace components through the preparation of antibody columns Erature, 285, 446 1980 . Furthermore, the use thereof as diagnostic reagents or therapeutic agents has been developed EuropeanJournal of Immunology, 9, 94 1979 . It is known that human interferon IFN includes at least three antigenically different types, namely alpha, beta and gamma Nature, 286, 110 1980 . It is also known that gamma interferon IFN y is produced mainly by T lymphocytes receiving stimulation fromamitogen or antigen, and IFN y is also called immune interferon I IFN TheInterferon System, Springer Publishing Co., New York, 12792. It is anticipated that IFN y is produced in living hodies as a result of various immune responses, and it is presumed that IFN y plays an important role in immunoregulation.IFN y differs in antigenic characteristics and in inducer species from alpha interferon IFN a and betainterferon CIFN . It is further known that IFN y is acid labile and heat labile The Interferon System, SpringerPublishing Co., New York, 19793. IFNs are generally defined as antivirally active substances produced by living bodies. It has been proved that they have various other biological activities, and their antitumor activity is a focus of attention blood, 55, 711, 1980 ibid., 56, 875, 1980 . For inhibiting tumor growth, two methods are conceivable. One is direct inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and the other is indirect inhibition of tumors growth via immune responses in hosts. The latter case possibly includes natural killer CNK cell activation, macrophage activation and killer T cell activation, among others.In fact, it has. been demonstrated that IFNs exert various immune response potentiating actions such as mentioned above in addition two direct actions fBiochemica et Biophysica Aota, 516, 231, 1978 .Since IFN y is by far higher in such various in vitro activities associated with antitumor effect and in vivo activities than IFN a and IFN B, its importance has been emphasized Cellular Immunology, 49, 390, 1980 . However, the IFN y potency that can be induced in vitro is generally low, few established cell lines are adequate enough as IFN y producing ones, and IFN y purification is difficult due to its lability to heat and acids. For these and other reasons, the large scale production and purification of IFN y have been much delayed as compared with IFN alpha and IFN ss. Very recently, it was reported that natural IFN y could he made singly fproceedings of the National Academy ofSciences, 79, 1820, 1982 , but recovery of activity is very poor. A more effective purification method, therefore, is eagerly waited for. On the other hand, cloning of the human IFN y gene was reported and it has become possible to produce, at least as a species of IFN y, an about 17 kilodalton molecular species composed of 146 amino acids in Escherichia coli Nature, 295, 503, Cl982 Nucleic Acids Research, 10, 2487, 19823. However, natural product IFN y reportedly includes various species having different molecular weights and the counterpart relationship among the molecular species is unknown. From such viewpoints, to obtain monoclonal antibodies to various IFN y species is not only important for establishing the correspondency among molecular speeies but also provides a very powerful weapon for purifying naturalIFN y or IFN y produced in Escherichia coli by using genetic engineering techniques. Avery recent report describes the acquisition of a monoclonal antibody against natural IFN y nature, 296, 258, C1982 . When IFN y comprises a plurality of molecular species, it is very important to obtain monoclonal antibodies to molecular species cloned by gene manipulation techniques. Disclosure of the Invention Based on the reported amino acid sequence of humanIFN y reduced from the nucleotide sequence of its structural gene Nucleic Acids Research, 10, 2487 1982 , the present inventors synthesized, chemically a C terminal polypeptide taken from said amino acid sequence, namely peptide of the formula N C H X Lys Arg Ser Gln Met Leu Phe Arg Gly Y OH I wherein X is a bond, or a peptide or amino acid residue having 1 to 16 amino acids counting from the C terminus of the peptide chain of N Ile Gln Val Met Ala Glu Leu Ser Pro Ala C Ala Lys Thr Gly Lys Arg and Y is a peptide or amino acid residue having 1 to 5 amino acids counting from the N terminus of the peptide chain of N C Arg Arg Ala Ser Gln and furthermore produced protein conjugate by coupling chemically it with carrier protein. The thus obtained polypeptide and protein conjugate were used for immunization of mammals, and hybridomas were made by cell fusion of spleen cells taken from the mammals with lymphoid cells from the same or different species of mammals and cloned. Inoculating the thus obtained hybridomas into mammal, allowing them to grow and produce monoclonal antibodies, and recovering thereof gave monoclonal antibodies against the above mentioned polypeptide. Furthermore, the present inventors established a method of purifying human IFN y from a crude product containing human IFN y using the monoclonal antibodies obtained and also a method of detecting human IFN y by radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme immunoassay EIA using the same.The present invention has been completed in this manner. Thus, the present invention provides novel polypeptide I , protein conjugate thereof, novel cloned hybridoma, novel monoclonal antibody, and methods of production thereof, and further a use of said monoclonal antibody. Referring to the above polypeptide I , it is preferable that Y is Arg Arg Ala Ser Gln or and X is Lys Arg. Furthermore, it is preferable that the polypeptide I contains 15 to 25 amino acid residues. Said peptide can be produced by the conventional methods of peptide synthesis. Either of the solid phase method and liquid phase method may be used, although the liquid phase synthetic method is advantageous in many cases.Such methods of peptide synthesis are described, for example, by SchrrBder and Lubke in The Peptides , vol. 1,Academic Press, New York, U.S.A., 1966, or by Izumiya et al.in Peptide Syntheses , Maruzen, Tokyo, Japan, 1975, or byHaruaki Yajima in Experiments in Biochemistry, viol. 1, pages 207 400, Tokyo Kagaku Dojin, 1977, and include, among others, the azide method, chloride method, acid anhydride method, mixed acid anhydride method, DCC method, active ester method, method using Woodward reagent K, carhodiimidazole method, oxidation reduction method andDCC additive Ce.g. HONB, HOBt, HOSu method. Said peptide can be produced by condensing a a reactive carboxyl containing starting material corresponding to a partial component of polypeptide I with b a reactive amino containing starting material corresponding to the remainder of polypeptide I , both hexing optionally protected by any of the conventional peptide synthesis methods and, in case the condensation product has a protective group, eliminating the protective group in the conventional manner. The method of protecting a functional group which should not be involved in the reaction between the materials, the protective group to be used in such protection, the method of eliminasing such protective group and the method of activating the functional group to be involved in the reaction, for instance, can be selected adequately from among known ones or means. Thus tht protective group for the amino group in the starting materal includes, among others, carbobenzoxy, t butyloxycartonyl, t amyloxycarbonyl, isobornyloxycarbonyl p metkoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, 2 chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, adamantyloxycarbonyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalyl, formyl, o nitrophenylsulfenyl, diphenylphosphinothioyl and 4 methoxy 2,3,6 trimethylbenzenesulfonyl. The carboxylprotecting group includes alkyl ester groups e.g. esterforming groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and t hutyl , benzyl ester group, p nitrobenzyl ester group, p methoxybenzyl ester group, p chlorobenzyl ester group, benzhydryl ester group, carbobenzoxyhydrazide group, t hutyloxycarbonylhydrazide group and tritylhydrazide group, among others. The protective group for the guanidino group of arginine is, for example, nitro, tosyl, p methoxybenzenesulfonyl, carbohenzoxy, isobornyloxycarbonyl, admantyloxycarbonyl, 4 methoxy 2, 6 dimethylbenzenesulronyl or pentamethylbenzenesulfonyl. The guanidino group may also he protected in the form of an acid e.g. benzenesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, hydrochloric or sulfuric acid salt. The hydroxyl group of threonine can be protected hy esterification or etherification, for instance. Groups adequate for this esterification are, for example, lower alkanoyl groups, such as acetyl, aroyl groups, such as henzoyl, and carbonic acid derived groups, such as benzyi ozycarbonyl and ethyloxyearbonyl. Groups suited for the etherification are, for instance, benzyl, tetrahydropyranyl and t butyl. However, the hydroxyl group of threonine does not always need protection. Methionine may be protected in the form of a sulfoxide.The activated form of carhoxyl in the starting material includes, among others, the corresponding acid anhydrides, azides and active esters testers with pentachlorophenol, p nitrophenol, N hydroxysuccinimide, N hydroxybenzotriazole, N hydroxy5 norbornene 2,3 dicarboximide, etc. . In some cases, the peptide bond forming reaction can be carried out in the presence of a dehydrating agent Ce.g. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, carbodiimidazole or the like carbodiimide reagent . The peptide condensation reaction can be conducted in the presence of a solvent. The solvent may be selected adequately from among those known to be usable in the peptide condensation reaction. Examples are anhydrous or aqueous dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, pyridine, chloroform, dioxane, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate and N methylpyrrolidone, and adequate mixtures of these. The reaction temperature is selected within the range known to be usable in the peptide bond forming reaction, generally within the range of about 400C to about 600 C, preferably within the range of about 200C to ahout OOC, After completion of the condensation reaction, the protective group, if present in the product, can be eliminated by the conventianal method, for instance the reductive method e.g. hydrogenation using a catalyst such as palladium black, reduction with metallic sodium in liquid ammonia or acidolysls e.g. acidolysis with trifluoroacetic acid, hydrogen fluoride or methanesulfonic acid or a mixture thereof either in the absence or presence of a sulfur containing compound such as thioanisole . The peptide of the present invention as produced in the above manner can be recovered from the reaction mixture after completion of the reaction by ordinary means of separating peptides, such as extraction, partition and or column chromatography. Referring loathe conjugate between polypeptide CI and a carrier protein, the kind of carrier protein and the ratio of carrier to hapten in the present case, the polypeptide are optional provided that an antibody can be produced in an efficient manner against the hapten coupled with the carrier for immunization. Bovine serum albumin or bovine thyloglobulin, for instance, is used for coupling in an amount of 0.1 20, preferably 1 5 parts by weight per part hy weight of the hapten. For the coupling of the hapten with a carrier, a variety of condensing agents may be used. The use of glutaraldehyde or a carbodiimide is preferable. Mammals usable in immunization with the polypeptide I or protein conjugate thereof are experimental animals such as sheep, goats, rabbits, guinea pigs, rats and mice.For the production of monoclonal antibodies, rats and mice are preferred among them. The immunization of mice, for instance, can be carried out by any of the subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal and other routes and, in many cases, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intravenous Cespecially subcutaneous infusion is preferable. The immunization interval and immunizing dose, among others, may vary over a wide range, and various modifications are possible. For instance, the immunization is repeated 2 to 6 times at a 2 week interval, and spleen cells 1 5 days, preferably 2 4 days, after the last immunization are used in many cases. In each immunization, the immunizing dose of the peptide is desirably not less than 0.1 pg, preferably 10 300 pg.It is also desirable to make partial blood sampling prior to spleen excision and perform cell fusion experiments using spleen cells after confirmation of an increased blood antibody level. As to the above mentioned cell fusion of spleen cells with lymphoid cells, the lymphoid cell is that from a mammal of the same or different species from the immunized mammal Cpreferahly the same species , and cell fusion is carried out, for instance, between excised mouse spleen cells and a lymphoid cell line, such as myeloma cell line having a marker such as hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase deficiency HGRRT or thymidine kinase deficiency tTK . For the fusion, a fusing agent, such asSendai virus or polyethylene glycol CPEG , is used. It is of course possible to add a fusion accelerator such as dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO .The degree of polymerization of PEG is generally 1000 6000, the treatment period is 0.5 30 minutes, and the concentration is 10 80 , for instance.In a preferred example, the fusion can be effected efficiently by treatment with PEG 6000 at 35 55 for 4 10 minutes The fused cells can be selectively grown using a hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine medium EHAT medium Nature, 256, 495, CP975 a, for instance. The culture supernatant obtained after cell growth can he screened for the production of the desired antibody.The screening for antibody titer can be made in the following manner. Thus, in the first step, the production or nonproduction of an antibody against the peptide used for immunization can be checked by an appropriate method, such as RIA or EIA. Various modifications are possible for such method. As a preferred method of measurement, invention is made of a method using EIA. Rabbit anti mouse Smmunoglobulin antibody, for instance, is coupled with a carrier, such as cellulose in bead form, by the conventional method. The culture supernatant to be tested or mouse serum is added, and the reaction is allowed to proceed at a constant temperature which hereinafter means 4 400C for a predetermined period of time.The reaction product is washed well, then an enzyme labelled peptide prepared hy coupling the peptide with an enzyme by the conventional method followed by purification is added, and the reaction is allowed to proceed at a constant temperature for a predetermined period of time. The reaction product is washed well, an enzyme substrate is added, and the reaction is allowed to proceed at a constant temperature for a predetermined period. Thereafter, the resulting colored product can be assayed through the intensity of absorption or fluorescence, for instance. The cells in a well, after growth in a selective medium and detection of antibody activity against the peptide used for immunization, are desirably cloned by the limiting dilution method, for instance. The cloned cell culture supernatant is screened in the same manner, and the cells in a well having a high antibody titer are grown. In this manner, a monoclonal antibody producing hybridoma clone which is responsive to the peptide used for immunization canbe obtained. In the next place, it is necessary to examine whether the antibody produced by such clone is reactive not only with the peptide used for immunization but also with the very IFN y molecule. For this purpose, methods are available, for example a methodwhichexamines the reactivity hy RIA or by EIA using radio or enzyme labelled IFN y and a method which examines whether the biological activityCIFN y activity is absorbed by the antibody. The latter is advantageous inthatpurification of IFN y is not required.An advantageous example is described in the following, while other methods are of course possible, for instance a method comprising removing an immune precipitate using protein A and assaying the remaining IFN y activity in the supernatant. In said example, rabbit anti mouse immuno glodulin antibody, for instance, is coupled with a carrier such as cellulose in bead form by the conventional method, the hybridoma supernatant to be assayed or mouse serum is added, and the reaction is allowed to proceed at a constant temperature for a predetermined period. The reaction product is washed well, and a known quantity of IFN y is added. As the IFN y, there may be used, for instance, a culture supernatant containing IFN y induced from human peripheral blood lymphocytes with lectin and a phorbol ester, an extract containing recombinant IFN produced by E. coli etc. or the like. After the addition of IFN y, the reaction is allowed to proceed at a constant temperature for a predetermined period and. then the remaining IFN y activity in the supernatant is measured. In this manner, the absorption of IFN y activity by the antibody can be determined. The thus cloned hybridoma is grown in a liquid medium or in peritoneal cavity of a mammal to produce the monoclonal antibody of the present invention. The hybridoma is cultured, for instance, in a liquid medium, such as RPMI 1640 with 0.1 40 bovine serum added, for 2 10 days, preferably for 3 5 days, and said monoclonal antibody can be obtained from the culture broth. Furthermore, an antibody much higher in titer than the cell culture supernatant can be obtained in a large amount and in an efficient manner by inoculating an adequate mammal, such as the mouse with the hybridoma intraperitoneally, growing the cells and collecting the ascitic fluid. For this purpose, mice, such as BALB c mice, preinoculated with mineral oil or the like are intraperitoneally inoculated with 1 x 104 to 1 1 lox cells, preferably 5 x 105 to 2 x 106 cells, of the hybridoma and, after 7 20 days, preferably after 10 14 days, the ascitic fluid or the like is collected.The antibody formed and accumulated in the ascitic fluid can be isolated easily by fractionation with ammonium sulfate and DEAEcellulose column chromatography, for instance, to give a monoclonal antibody in the form of a pure immunoglobulin. The monoclonal antibody in accordance with the present invention has the following characteristic features t1 It binds to the polypeptide CI used for immuniza tfora C2 It binds to the IFN y molecule but not to IFN alpha orIFN ss C3 It belongs to the antibody subclass IgG2b or IgGl when tested by the Ouchterlony method C l In SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, it gives only two hands exactly corresponding to the H and L chains of a standard immunoglobulin. The monoclonal antibody can be safely produced3 used and stored. The monoclonal antibody obtained in accordance with the present invention can be used for the detection of a trace amount of IFN y in vivo or in vitro by making use of an EIA or RIA method and moreover can be used in purifying very efficiently IFN y, which is either natural or made by gene manipulation, by preparing antiboty columns, for instance, though the purification of IFN y has been considered very difficult. For instance, for the detection of IFN y, an IFN ycontaining sample or a standard IFN y sample is subjected to reaction with said monoclonal antibody labelled, for example, with radioactive iodine or an enzyme, then protein A, for instance, is added so as to cause immune complex precipitation and, after an adequate period of reaction, the radioactivity or enzyme activity in the precipitated immune complex is determined. In this manner IFN y assay can be performed in a simple and easy way. One example of IFN y assay by competitive method is as following. IFN y can be assayed by labelling the polypeotide I , for instance, with radioactive iodine or an enzyme, allowing a sample containing IFN y to be assayed to coexist in the system of reaction of the labelled polypeptide CI with a definite amount of the unlabelled monoclonal antibody of this invention, and causing the resulting immune complex to precipitate or be bound to an anti mouse antibody. Purified IFN Y may be used as the radioactive iodine or enzyme labelled material in plaoe of the polypeptide CI . Another example of IFN y assay by competitive method is as following. Partially purified IFN y or the polypeptide CI , for instance, is immobilized on a microtray or the like solid phase. Immobilization can be effected, for example, by suspending IFN Y or the polypeptide I in phosphate buffer containing 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate in a concentration ofQ.1 to 100 Vg ml, preferably 10 to 20 ug ml, and placing 100 jil of the suspension in each well on a microtray, followed by leaving for 24 hours.IFN y can be assayed by adding to said well the product obtained by reacting the monoclonal antibody of this invention with a sample containing IFN y to be assayed at 370C for an hour or at 40C for 20 hours, and further adding a radioactive iodine or enzymelabelled rabbit anti mouse antibody or the like. When an enzyme labelled rabbit anti mouse antibody or the like is used in such series of EIA methods, rapid assay becomes possible through the use of Multiskan Flow Lab. or the like photometer in the so called ELISA enzyme linked immunosorhent assay method. Furthermore, the use of monoclonal antibodies produced by two hybridoma clones differing in the. antigen recognition site may enable more simplified IFN y assay by the so called sandwich method.If an antigen adequate for the IFN Y assay using such EIA or RIA methos is obtained, various modifications are of course possible, and therefore the methods mentioned hereinahove are no more than examples. For the purification of IFN y, said antibody, after purification thereof, is coupled with an appropriate carrier, such as activated agarose gel in the form of beads, by the conventional method, a column is packed with the carrier, and a crude IFN y containing material, such as a culture supernatant or cell lysis product, is applied on the column, whereby IFN y is adsorbed thereon. Washing and subsequent elution, for example, with a chaotropic reagent such asKSCN or under weakly acidic conditions which do not lead to inactivation of IFN y can give efficiently purified IFN y.. The antibody column described above can be prepared, for instance in the following manner, by coupling the monoclonal antibody of the present invention as obtained in the purified state from the ascitic fluid or the like inoculated with the hybridoma with an appropriate carrier. The carrier may be of any kind provided that, after coupling, IFN y can be adsorbed specifically and efficiently and thereafter can be eluded by an adequate means. As an example, agarose gel in the form of beads, which is activated so as to facilitate the bonding of the primary amino group of a protein, for instance AFFI GEL 10 Bio Rad Lab., U.S.A. can he favorably used in the following manner. The reaction of AFFI GEL 10 with the antibody is carried out in a buffer solution, such as O.OOl l M, preferably 0.1 M, bicarbonate,Usable reaction conditions are00 200C, 10 minutes to 24 hours, and varying pH, and preferred conditions are 4 C, 4 hours and pH 3 10.The quantitative ratio between AFFIGEL 10 and the antibody may be selected within the range of up to about 50 mg of antibody per ml of AFFI GEL, since, in this range, the amount of antibody coupled with AFFI GEL increases as the amount of antibody increases. From the coupling efficiency viewpoint, the antibody is used in an amount of not more than 30 mg on said basis. The thusproduced antibody carrier coupling product is washed well with the same buffer solution as used for the reaction and then allowed to stand for several days or treated with ethanolamine hydrochloride in a final concentration of 0.05 M at 40C for an hour or by some other method so as to block the remaining unreacted active.groups, and packed in an appropriate column to give an antibody column. For the purpose of purification with the above antihody column, a human immune interferon protein containing sample, for instance, is dissolved in an almost neutral huffer, such as a phosphate buffer or Tris hydrochloride huffer, and made adsorbed on the antibody column. The column is washed with the same buffer and then IFN y is eluded Usable eluents are, for example, a weakly acidic solution e.g. acetic acid solution , a polyethylene glycolcontaining solution, a solution containing a peptide having a higher affinity for the antibody as compared with the sample, a high concentration salt solution, and a combination of these, among others. Those eluents which do not promote decomposition of human IFN y to a considerable extent are preferred The eluate from the column is neutralized with a buffer by the conventional method.If necessary, the purification procedure using the above antibody column can be repeated. The thus obtained human IFN y protein solution is dialyzed and, as necessary, can be made into a powder by lyophilization. In carrying out the lyophilization, a stabilizer, such as sorbitol, mannltol, dextrose, maltose or glycerol, can be added. The thus obtained human immune interferon protein, when assayed for antiviral activity in a test for evaluating the effect of inhibiting degeneration of human amnionderived WISH cells by the vesicular stomatitis virus VSV , shows a specific activity of not less than 107 U nig. The IFN activity in U ml units ml was determined in the following manner. An international standard IFN a for which the unit has been established and leukocyte derived crude IFN Y were assayed in the test for estimating the inhibitory effect against cell degeneration caused in a human amnion derived FL cell line by VSV, the titer of the lymphocyte derived IFN y was determined by comparison of the titers found, and said IFN y was used as a laboratory standard IFN y. In calculating the titer of IFN y in a material, this laboratory standard IFN y was always used fn parallel in the above mentioned assay in the WISH VSV system and the titer calculation was performed based on the titer ratio. The human immune interferon protein purified in accordance with the present invention comprises, for instance, a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of the formlua c.N H A Z1 Tyr Z2 Gln Asp Pro Tyr Val Lys Glu Ala Glu Asn Leu Lys Lys Tyr Phe Asn Ala Gly His Ser Asp Val Ala Asp Asn Gly Thr Leu Phe Leu Gly Ile Leu Lys Asn Trp Lys Glu Glu Ser Asp Arg Lys lie Net Gin Ser Gln Ile Val Ser Phe Tyr Phe Lys Leu Phe Lys Asn Phe Lys Asp Asp Gln Ser Ile Gln Lys Ser Val Glu Thr Ile Lys Glu Asp Met Asn Val Lys Phe Phe Asn Ser Asn Lys Lys Lys Arg Asp Asp Phe Glu Lys Leu Thr Asn Tyr Ser Val Thr Asp Leu Asn Val Gin Arg Lys Ala Ile His Glu Leu Ile Gln Val Met Ala Glu Leu Ser Pro Ala Ala Lys Thr Gly Lys Arg Lys Arg Ser Gln Met Leu Phe Arg Gly Arg Arg Ala Ser Gln OH C II wherein A is Met or a bond, and Z1 and Z2 each is Cys or 1 2 Cys. The purification procedures according to the present invention can give said polypeptide in a purity of not less than gOX, in particular not less than 95 , on the dried basis.

Three days after the final immunization, the spleen was excised from the gamma 2 mouse, filtered under pressure through a stainless mesh, and suspended in Eagle s minimum essential medium MEM to give a spleen cell suspension0 For cell fusion, BALB C mouse derived P3 x63.Ag8.Ul P3U1 myeloma cells were used Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology, 81, 1, 1978 .Cell fusion was performed by the original method Nature, 256, 495, 1975 . Thus, spleen cells and P3Ul cells were separately washed three times with serum free MEM and mixed at a ratio of 5 1 in number of cells . The mixture was centrifuged at 800 rpm for 15 minutes, whereby the cells were settled. After thorough removal of the supernatant, the sediment was lightly loosened, 0,3 ml of 45 polyethylene glycol PEG 6000 Soch Light was added, ani the mixture was allowed to stand in a warm water tank maintained at 37 C for 7 minutes so as to effect cell fusion. Thereafter, MEM was added thereto at a rate of 2 ml per minute. After addition of 12 ml in total of NEN, the resulting mixture was centrifuged at 600 rpm for 15 minutes, followed by removal of the supernatant. The cell sediment was suspended in RSMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum RPMI1640 10FCS in a concentration of 2 x 105 P3U1 cells ml and each of 144 wells on 24 well multidishes Linbro was seeded with 1 ml of the suspension. After seeding, the cells were incubated at 37 C in a 5 carbon dioxide gas incubator. After 24 hours, HAU selective culture was started by adding PRMI1640 10FCS medium supplemented with HAT 1 x 10 M hypoxanthine, 4 x 10 7 M M aminopterin, 1.6 x 10 5 M thymidine HA medium in an amount of 1 ml per well. The HAT selective culture was continued while 1 ml of the old medium was replaced by 1 ml of fresh HAT medium 3, 5 and 7 days after start of the culture The growth of hybridomas was noted 10 to 14 days after cell fusion. When the culture broth turned yellow about 1 x 106 cells ml , the supernatant was collected and examined for the presence of antibody by the EIA method. In this manner, supernatants from 141 wells in which hybridoma growth had been noted were examined.Two wells y2 1l and gamma 2 100 afforded intense antibody activity and other two wells y2 62 and Y2 70 presented weak antibody activity. Example 7Cloning Hybridomas from 3 wells Y2 ll, 62 and 100 which were positive in antibody activity were cloned by the limiting dilution method. Thus, hybridomas were suspended in RPMI1640 20FCS in a concentration of 2 hybridomas ml and the suspension was distributed in O.l ml portions into the wells on a 96 well microplate Munc . In said distribution, 5 x 105 per well of hAIM c mouse thymocytes were added as feeder cells. As a result, cell proliferation was observed in about 2 weeks The supernatant was then collected and examined for the presence of antibodies by the EIA method as described inExample 4.Antibody activity was noted in 8 out of 19 clones from y2 ll in 3 out of 54 clones from y2 62 and in 5 out of 47 clones from y2 l00 Table 2 .

Thereafter, the cellulose was thoroughly washed with physiological saline, and 550 U ml of IFN y obtained by the procedure mentioned below was added thereto.After 3 to 4 hours of reaction, the supernatant was collected and the IFN y activity therein was determined by the cytopathic effect CPE reading method using a microplate Applied Microbiology, 16 1706, 1968 . Thus, 50 l of MEM was placed in each well of a 96 well microplate Nunc and 50 jil of theIEN sample was added to the first well, followed by serial two fold dilution. To each well thus prepared, 50 l of a WISH cell suspension 4 x 105 cells ml in 20 FCS containing MEM was added, and incubation was conducted in a carbon dioxide gas incubator at 370C for 24 hours.Thereafter, 50 l of a vesicular stomatitis virus New Jersey strain preparation adjusted to a concentration of 2000TCID50 TCID50 median tissue culture infecting dose was added to each well and incubation was performed in a carbon dioxide incubator at 37 C. About 35 hours later, when cells in the IFN sample free well showed 100 CPE, each well was microscopically observed for the estimation of CPE,Xand the reciprocal of the dilution factor for the IFN sample in that well in which 50 CPE was noted was referred to as the IFN titer. The 1FN y sample used was the supernatant collected 72 hours after stimulation of human peripheral lymphocytes with 40 Fg ml of concanavalin A and 15 ng ml of 12 0 tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate. Each ml of this culture supernatant containined 4400 units of human IFN y heatand acid labile . If antibodies having binding capacity to IFN y are present in the cloned cell culture supernatant, then the added lEN y should bind to the antibodies on cellulose and reduction in IFN y activity of the supernatant should occur. As a result, for the clone y2 1l, relatively intense binding activity to IFN gamma was noted and 50 75 of the added IFN y 550 U ml bound to antibodies Table 3 .

Ten days after intraperitoneal administration of hybridomas, the ascitic fluid was taken and examined for antibody activity up to 107 fold dilution. While the antibody activity of the corresponding clone cell culture supernatant was detected up to 104 fold dilution, the formation of ascites ascitization led to an about 1000 times increase in antibody activity. Example 10 Monoclonal antibody purification Using 4 ml of the ascitic fluid obtained in Example 9 as the starting material, monoclonal antibody purification was performed by the method of Staehelin et al. Journal of Biological Chemistry, 256, 9750, h981 . Thus, the ascitic fluid was first centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 minutes to remove fibrin like substances therefrom and then diluted with phosphate buffer saline PBS 8.1 mM NaH2PO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 2.7 mM KCl, 137 mMNaCl pH 7.2 to a concentration at which the ultraviolet absorption at 280 nm A280 for said dilution would range from 12 to 14. Thereafter, saturated aqueous ammonium sulfate was added to the diluted sample to a concentration of 47 for the sulfate. The mixture was stirred at 400 for 60 minutes to effect salting out and then centrifuged 10,000 rpm, 15 minutes to give a precipitate.The precipitate was dissolved in 20 mM Trips buffer pE 7.9 containing 50 mM NaCl and dialyzed against 2 liters of the same buffer. Tow hours later, the dialyzing solution was replaced by a fresh 2 liter portion of the same solution and the dialysis was continued for further 15 hours.Thereafter, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 minutes, and the supernatant was adjusted to a concentration such that the A280 value became 20 30. This sample was subjected to fractionation on a DEAE cellulose column 8 ml,Whatman DE52 equilibrated with a sufficient amount ofTris buffer containing 50 mN Nail. After extensive washing with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min,NaCl consentrationwas linearly increased from 50 mM to 500 mM, Under these conditions, the antibody activity was detected mainly in effluent fractions Fig, 1 .Confirmation that the purified sample is antibody was made by SES polyacrylamide gel elctrophoresis SDS PAGE method as described by Laemmli et al. Nature, 227, 680, 1970 . Thus, some of the fractions obtained by ammonium sulfate salting out and DEAE cellulose fractionation were each subjected to reduction with 2 mercaptoethanol, followed by 17 SDS gel electrophoresis at 30 volts for 24 hours. In agreement with the antibody activity peaks, two bands were noted at positions corresponding to molecular weights of about 55 kilodaltons H chain and about 28 kilodaltons L chain Fig, 2 . The thus purified antibody fraction 17 was examined for IFN gamma binding activity by addingIFN y 2200 U ml as described in Example 8.It was thus found that about 50 of IFN y was bound to the antibody Table 4 6 Table 4EMI39.1 tb SEP Sample SEP Dilution SEP Residual SEP IFN SEP activity tb SEP U ml tb gamma 2 11.1 SEP SEP fraction SEP 17 SEP 10 1 SEP 1100 tb SEP 10 2 SEP 1100 tb SEP 10 3 SEP 2200 tb SEP 10 4 SEP 2200 tb Anti IgE SEP monoclonal SEP 10 1 SEP 2200 tb antibody SEP 10 2 SEP 2200 tb SEP 10 3 SEP 2200 tb SEP 10 4 SEP 2200 tb Example 11Subclass to which monoclonal antibodies belong The fraction 17 purified by the method of Example 10 was diluted 10 times and subjected to immunoprecipitation reaction in agar Ouchterlony test ImmunologicalMethods, Gel Diffusion Technique, Blackwell, Oxford, 1964 using goat anti mouse IgGl, G2a, G2b and G3 antibodies Miles so the IgG subclass to which T2 11.1 monoclonal antibody might belong could be identified. A single distinct band was found between the monoclonal antibody and the goat anti mouse IgG2b antibody, while no band formation was noted between the monoclonal antibody and other anti antibodies.

Separately, 25 ml of AFFI GEL 10 Bio Rad 3 was thoroughly washed with water using a glass filter, suspended in 0.1 M NaHCO3 pH 8.3 and mixed with the above antibody, The mixture was stirred gently at 4 C for 4 hours to effect the reaction, and then allowed to stand at 4 C overnight. The resulting AFFI GEL 10 was washed well with 0.1 M NaRCO3 pH 8.3 using a glass filter.To the gel was added 25 ml of a solution pH 8.0 containing 0.1 M ethanolamine and 0.15 M NaCl, The mixture was shaken at 400 for an hour so as to block possibly remaining unreacted active groups. Then, the gel was washed well with PBS, and suspended in 25 ml of 0.1 NaN3 containing PBS The suspension was stored at 4 C.Based on the amount of the added antibody and the amount of the antibody in the recovered filtrate, it was found that the antibody was conjugated to the gel in a proportion of 2.35 mg ml of gel. A column was packed with the reaction product obtained in this manner and used as an antibody column, Example 13 Sixty ml of the supernatant obtained in ReferenceExample 4 was diluted with 20 mM Tris HCl containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.15 M NaCl pH 7.6 TEN to make 150 ml and the dilution was submitted to an anti IFN y antibody column 9 ml prepared by the method of Example 12. The column was washed well with TEN and further with TEN containing 0.01 Nonidet P40 Shell and 0.5 M NaCl.Then, IFN Y was eluted with 0.1 M acetic acid containing 0.25 M Nail. The eluate was immediately neutralized with 1 M Tris HCl pH 7.6 . The resulting solution was dialyzed against distilled water at 4 C for 16 hours and, after freezing with acetone dry ice, lyophilized to give a powder0 The results obtained are shown below.

The characterization of this protein is mentioned below. Characterization of human immune interferon protein i Molecular weight The protein obtained in Example 13 was treated with 2 mercaptoethanol, subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel 17.5 electrophoresis 15 mV, 6 hours and stained with Coomassie blue. The protein could be identified as a single band Fig. 3 . From the relation between the migration distance for the molecular weight markers simultaneously subjected to electrophoresis and the migration distance for the protein, the molecular weight of the protein was estimated at 17,000 1,000 Fig, 4 . For the protein not treated with 2 mercaptoethanol, an additional band was detected at a position corresponding to a molecular weight of 33,000 2,000, This value is about two times the molecular weight of 1FN y, , namely 17,000 1,000, suggesting that the band is due to dimerized IFN gamma . ii Amino acid analysis An aliquot of the protein obtained in Example 13 was placed in a glass tube for hydrolysis and a 200 times V W amount of constant boiling point hydrochloric acid containing 4 thioglycolic acid was added. The tube was sealed under reduced pressure and hydrolysis was conducted at 11000 for 24, 48 and 72 hours. After each hydrolysis, the tube was opened, the hydrochloric acid was removed under reduced pressure, and the residue was dissolved in 0.02 N hydrochloric acid and analyzed using a HitachiModel 835 high speed amino acid analyzer. For the determination of cystine and cysteine, the above protein was oxidized with performic acid according to Emirs et al. Methods in Enzymology, 11, 197, 1967 and hydrolyzed in the same manner as above for 24 hours, and cysteinic acid was quantitatively determined by using the amino acid analyzer. The mean of three values obtained after 24, 48 and 72 hours of hydrolysis was employed as the found value for each amino acid except for the cases of serine, threonine, thyrosine and tryptophan, where the values were estimated by extrapolation of the hydrolysis period to 0 hour.The results are shown Table 6Amino acid detected Mole Amino acid detected Mole Aspaxtic acid 13.4 Nethionine 2.9Threonine 3.6 Isoleucine 4.8Serine 7.4 Leucine 608Glutamic acid 12.5 Thyrosine 3.4 Proline 1.4 Phenylalanine 6.7Glycine 3.8 Lysine 13.5Alanine 5.3 Histidine 1.5Cysteic acid 1.3 Arginine 5.4Valine 5.7 Tryptophan 0.9 iii Amino terminal amino acid analysis The protein obtained in Example 13 was oxidized with perfornic acid according to Rirs et al. methods in Enzymology, 11, 197, 1967 and then subjected to amino terminal amino acid analysis by the modifiedEdman degradation method of Iwanaga et al. Eur. J. Biochem. 8 189, 1969 . The resulting phenylthiohydantoin amino acide PTH amino acids were identified and quantitatively determined on a Varian USA Model 5040 high performance liquid chromatograph using an Ultrasphere ODS column Altex, USA 4.6 x 250 mm, particle size 5 m by the method of Archer et al. Altex Chromatogram, 3, 8, 1980 . As a result, PTHmethionine sulfone and PTH cysteic acid were detected. As is evident from the above mentioned examples, the purification method according to the present invention can produce substantially pure human immune interferon proteins having a specific activity of not less than 7.5 x 107 U mg. The results obtained with the monoclonal antibodies from y 3 mice are described in the following. Example 14 Immunization A fourth immunization was performed in the y 3 mouse listed in Table 1 in the same manner as the second and third immunizations in Example 5. Two weeks after the fourth immunization, a final immunization was conducted in the same manner as in Example 5 by intravenous inoculation with 120 g of the antigen dissolved in 0.5 ml of saline. example 15 Cell fusion Spleens were excised from the y 3 mouse 3 days after the final immunization described in Example 14, and cell fusion and HAT selection culture were carried out by the procedure of Example 6, As a result, hybridoma growth was noted in 43 wells. Antibody assay by the ElA method described in Example 4 revealed strong antibody activity in two wells y3 ll and y3 19 0 Example 16 Cloning The hybridomas in the two wells alpha 3 11 and y3 19 which showed strongly positive antibody activity were cloned by the procedure of Example 7.

The IFN y sample used in this example was the product of expression in Escherichia coli of the human IFN Y gene inserted in plasmid recombinant IFN y cf, ReferenceExample 4 , and its concentration was adjusted to 1100U ml. Strong IFR y binding ability was noted in the supernatants of the clones y3 11.1 and Y3 19.20, with about 90 of IFN y added being bound to the antibody Table 8 .

The monoclonal antibodies obtained were subclassified by the agar gel precipitin test described in Example 11, Both the monoclonal antibodies from y3 11.1 and y3 19.20 gave evident bands with sheep anti mouse IgGl antibody but no bands with other anti antibodies. It was thus revealed that the T3 11.1 and y3 19.20 monoclonal antibodies belong to IgGl Table 9 .

After 24 hours of treatment at 4 C, the plate was subjected to ELISA. Thus, an antibody y5 11.1 solution 100 l containing the antibody in an amount of about 50 of the maximum binding amount was reacted with the recombinant IFN gamma adjusted to various concentrations 75, 3 x 102, 1.25 x 5 x 103, 2 x 104, 8 x 104 U ml at 37 C for an hour.The reaction mixtures were added to the above plate, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 9 hours. The wells were then washed with phosphate buffer, horseradish peroxidase labelled sheep anti mouseIgG antibody 100 l was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 3 hours0Thereafter, the wells were washed well with phosphate buffer, then a substrate solution 100 l prepared by adding 22 mg of ortho phenylene diamine and 10 l l of hydrogen peroxide to 10 ml of 0.1 M citrate buffer was added, and the enigmatic reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 15 minutes.Then, 4 N sulfuric acid was added to terminate the reaction, and the resulting pigment was assayed at the wavelength of 492 nm using a Titertek Multiskan photometer. The results are shown in Fig, 9.It was revealed that the ELISA method can be used for the assay of IFN Y the concentration range of 3 x 102 to 5 x 103 U ml. Example 20 ElA method II for assaying IFN y Assay method based on the competition for the monoclonal antibody between a IFN y sample and b enzyme labelled peptide of this inventionExample 20 i The recombinant IFN y obtained in Reference Example 4 was made into preparations having various concentrations 64, 320,1.6 x 103, 8 x 103, 5 x 104, 2 x 105 U ml , and 100 p1 of each preparation was reacted with 100 jil of a solution containing a known amount of gamma 3 11.1 or y3 19.20 antibody at room temperature for 2 hours Then, 100 l of the enzyme bound peptide derivative obtained in Example 3 was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 4 C for 48 hours0 Each reaction mixture was added to 100 l of rabbit anti mouse IgG antibody bound 3 cellulose solution, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 4 hours. Thereafter, the enzymatic reaction was performed in the same manner as described in Example 4 and the fluorescence intensity was measured.The binding of the enzyme bound polypeptide derivative to the monoclonal antibody gamma 3 11.1, gamma 3 19.20 was slightly inhibited in the presence of 320 U ml of IFN gamma and almost completely inhibited in the presence of 8 x 103 U ml Fig. 10 . Therefore, this method can assay IFN gamma in the concentration range of 320 to 8 x 103 U ml. Example 20 ii The following modification, which is based on the same principle as that in Example 20 i but can assay a large number of samples automatically and quickly by usingMultiskan, was performed. 1 Preparation of mouse IgG adsorbed plate A mouse IgG solution 10 g ml, 0.01 M borate buffer, pH 8,0 was distributed in 200 p1 portions into the wells of a 96 well microtesting plate Nunc Immunoplate I, Nunc,Denmark . After allowing to stand at 4 C overnight, the solution was removed, 300 p1 of 0.02 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 1 of BSA was poured into each well and, after allowing to stand at room temperature for 3 hours, the buffer was removed. 2 Preparation of monoclonal antibody gamma 3 11.1 adsorbed plate Into each well of the mouse IgG adsorbed plate prepared in 1 , there was poured 150 p1 of a 350,000 fold gamma 3 11.1 dilution prepared with 0.02 M phosphate buffer CpH 7 containing 0.1 of BSA. After allowing to stand at 4 C overnight, the dilution was.removed, the wells were washed three times with 0.01 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 to give an antibody adsorbed plate. 3 . Procedure An assay sample and a standard IFN gamma were each diluted to an adequate concentration with buffer A 0.02 M pH 7 phosphate buffer containing 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 3SA and 0.1 NaN3 .

The reactant solution was removed, and the well were washed with four 75 l portions of 0.01 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 . For coloration, 150 l of a 1.5 mg ml solution of 4 nitrophenyl ss D galactopyranoside Wako Pure ChemicalIndustries, special grade in buffer A was poured into each well on the plate, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature overnight. The coloration reaction was terminated by adding 100 l of 0.4 M carbonate buffer pH 10.5 to each well, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured.on a photometer for microtesting plates, TitertekMultiskan Flow Laboratories, USA .A standard curve for IFN gamma is shown in Fig, 11.

This RNA precipitate was dissolved in 0.25 sodium N lauroyl sarcosinate and then precipitated with ethanol to give 8,3 mg of RNA.This RNA was allowed to be absorbed, in a high concentration salt solution 0.5M NaCl, 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6 1 mM EDTA, 0.3 SDS , on oligo dT cellulose column and mI NA containing poly A was eluted with a low concentration salt solution 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3 SDS to given 700 g of mENA.This mRNA was further precipitated with ethanol, then dissolved in 0,2 ml of a solution 10 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.6, 2 mM EDTA, 0.3 SDS , treated at 6500 for 2 minutes, and fractionated by 10 35 sucrose density gradient centrifugation at 20 C and 25000 rpm for 21 hours using a Beckman SW27 rotor, to give 22 fractions0 Aliquots of each fraction were injected into Ienopus laevis oocytes and the proteins synthesized were assayed for interferon activity Cantiviral activity as determined by the cytopathic effect inhibition assay using vesicular stomatitis virus on WISH cells derived from human amnion Stewart, W.E. The interferon System, Springer New York, 1979, page 11 .In this manner, it was found that fraction 12 the sedimentation constant being 12 14S had an activity of 195 units per g of RNA. The mRNA in the thus obtained fraction 12 weighed about 20 g. ii Synthesis of single stranded RNA Using the above mRNA and a reverse transcriptase, 100 Cil of a reaction mixture 5 g of mRNA, 50 g of oligo dT , 100 units of reverse transcriptase, I mM each of dATP, dGTP, dGTP and dTTP, 8 mM MgCl2, 50 mM EC1, 10 mM dithiothreitol and 50 mM Tris HC1 pH 8.3 was incubated at 42 C for 1 hour, then, deproteinized by adding phenol and treated with 0lN NaOH at 70 C for 20 minutes for removal of RNA by decomposition. iii Synthesis of double stranded DNA The thus synthesized single stranded complementary DNA was subjected to reaction in 50 p1 of a reaction mixture the same mixture as above except that the mRNA and oligo dT were absent at 4200 for 2 hours for synthesizing the double stranded DNA. iv Addition of dC tails The double stranded DNA was treated with nuclease S1 in 50 l of a reaction mixture doublestranded DNA, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 0.25 M NaCl, 1.5 mM ZnSO4, 60 units S1 nuclease at room temperature for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was deproteinized by adding phenol and DNA was precipitated with ethanol. The thus obtained DNA was reacted with terminal transferase in 50 l of a reaction mixture double stranded DNA, 0.14 M potassium cacodylate, 0,3 M Tris base pH 7.6 , 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM CoCl2, 0.15 mM dCTP, 30 units terminal transferase at 37 C for 3 minutes for elongation of the double stranded DNA by about 20 deoxycytidine about 20 units at each 3 end of the DNA.This series of reactions gave about 900 ng of deoxycytidine tailed doubl stranded DNA. v Cleavage of Escherichia coli plasmid and addition of dG tails Separately, 10 g of Escherichia coli plasmid PBR 322 DNA was treated with restriction enzyme PstI in 50 l of a reaction mixture 10 g DNA, 50 mM NaCl, 6 mMTris HCl pH 7.4 , 6 mM MgCl2, 6 mM 2 mercaptoethanol, 100 g mg bovine serum albumin, 20 units PstI at 37 C for 3 hours for cleavage at the one PstI recognition site present in the pBR322DNA, the reaction mixture was then deproteinized with phenol and the DNA was further subjected to terminal trahsferase treatment in 50 l of a reaction mixture 10 g DNA, 0.14 M potassium cacodylate, 0.3 M Tris base pH 7.6, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 inn CoC12, 0.15 inn dGTP, 30 units terminal transferase at 37 C for 3 minutes for elongation of the above p3R322 plasmid DNA by about 8 deoxyguanidines at each 3 end thereof. vi Annealing of cDNA and transformation of Escherichia coli The annealing was effected by heating 0.1 g of the thus obtained synthetic double stranded. DNA and 0.5 g of the above pBR322 plasmid in a solution containing 0.1M NaCl, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA at 65 C for 2 minutes and then at 45 C for 2 hours, followed by gradual cooling. The transformation of Escherichia coli X1776 was performed by the method of Enea et al. J. Mol. Biol., 96, 495 1975 . vii Isolation of cDNA containing plasmid About 8,500 tetracycline resistant colinies were thus isolated and the DNA of each colony was fixed to a nitrocellulose filter M. Grunstein and D.S. Hogness, Proc. Natal. Acad. Soi. USA, 72, 3961 1975 . Separately, based on the amino acid sequence of IFN gamma as reported by D.V. Goeddel et al. Nature, 295, 503 1982 , two oligonuolotides of 5 TCCTGGCAGTAGC3 and 5 ACATTCATATCCTCCT3 presumably corresponding to amino acids Nos. 1 5 Cys. Try. Cys. Gln. Asp and amino acide Nos. 77 82 Lys. Gln, Asp. Met. Asn. Val of said I IPNsequence, respectively, were chemically synthesized by the triester method R, Crea et al.,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 75, 5765 1978 .These oligonucleotides were treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase in 50 l of a reaction mixture 0.2 g oligonucleotide, 50 mM Tris HC1 pH 8,0, 10 mM MgCl2 10 mM mercaptoethanol, 50 Ci gamma 32 P ATP, 3 units 24 polynucleotide kinase at 37 C for an hour, These oligopeptides thus labeled with 32P at the 5 end were used as probes and annealed with the DNA on the abovementioned nitrocellulose filter by the method of Lawn et al, Nucleic Acids Res., 9, 6103 1981 ,Four strains were isolated by autoradiography which were reactive to the above two oligonucleotide probes, Plasmid DNAs were isolated from the bacterial cells of each of these strains by the alkali method H,C. Birnboim and J, Doly, Nucleic Acids Res 7 1513 1979 .The inserts in the plasmid DNAs were excised with the PstI restriction enzyme. From among the isolated plasmids, the one containing the longest insert was chosen and named pHIT3709 , The structure base sequence of the cDNA sequence inserted in the pHIT3709 plasmid was then determined by the dinucleotide synthetic chain termination method and by the Maxam Gilbert method.Said primary structure was as shown in Fig, 5, The base sequence of the IFN y coding region codonNo.Sl to No.146 of pHIT3709 was identical with that shown in Fig.3 of Nucleic Acids Res., 10, 2487 et seq. 1982 . Reference Example 2 1 Plasmid ptrp601 vector being pBR322 containing the promoter portion for tryptophan synthesis inEscherichia coli Cpromotor and operator containing DNA fragment, 276 base pairs, G.N. bennett et al., J. Mol. Biol., 121, 113 1978 was constructed as the expression plasmid. Separately, plasmid pBR322 was cut with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and AvaI. The thus obtained sticky ends of EcoRI Aval fragment which contained tetracycline resistant gene were filled with DNA polymerase I large fragment. This fragment was allowed to be conjugated to the PvuII cleavage site of ptrp601 using T4DNA ligase. ptrp701 was thus constructed Fig, 6 . ii For the purpose of excluding either of the two restriction enzyme Clal cleavage sites present in ptrp701, ptrp701 was subjected to partial decomposition treatment with clay for giving ptrp7Ol in which either of the two Clal cleavage sites had been cut. After filling the sticky ends with DNA polymerase I large fragment, the thus obtained ptrp701 was again conjugated using T4INA ligase to give ptrp771 Fig, 6 . Ciii pRIT3709 was cut with the restriction enzyme PstI to give the PstI fragment containing structural gene of IFN gamma . This fragment was further subjected to the partial digetion with the restriction enzyme BstNIto give theBstNI PstI fragment which was cut at the BstNI site present in the IFN y structural gene. The sticky ends of the BstNI cleavage site were filled in with DNA polymerase I large fragment. The fragment thus obtained and the oligonucleotide adapter CGATAATGTGTTACTGCC TATTACACAATGACGG which was chemically synthesized by the above mentioned triester method and contains the protein synthesis start codon ATG, were ligated using T4DNA ligase. Separtely, the IFN Y gene ligated with the above mentioned adapter was inserted into the PstI ClaI site of Plasmid vector ptrp771 downstream from the tryptophan promoter using T4DNA lipase. An IFN Y expression plasmid pHITtrpllOl was thus constructed Fig, 7 . iv pHITtrp2101 was constructed by further improvement of pHITtrpllOl, as follows. ptrp601 was first treated with the restriction enzymes ClaI and HpaII to give 0.33 Kb of theClaI HpaII fragment containing trp promoter. This fragment was ligated with pHITtrp1101, which was cut with ClaI and treated with alkaline phosphatase, usingT4DNA ligase. pHITtrp2101 containing two successive trp promoters was thus obtained Fig, 8 . A strain E. coli 294 pHIT trp2101 was obtained by transforming Escherichia coli 294 deposited as IFO 14171 with plasmid pHIT trp2101 by the method of Cohen et al. cit. supra .Reference Example 3 E. Goli 294 pHITtrp2101 was incubated in 200 ml of M9 medium containing 8 Ag ml tetracycline, 0.4 casamino acid and 1 glucose in a 1 A flask at 37 C. When the growth of the bacteria reached KU220, 3ss indolyl acrylic acid IAA was added at a concentration of 30 pg ml and the mixture was further incubated for 4 hours. Reference Example 4 After 1.2 of the culture solution as obtained inReference Example 3 was centrifuged, the cells were collected and suspended in 60 ml of 0.05 M Tris HC1 pH 7.6 containing 10 sucrose. To this cell suspension, 0,3 ml of 0.2 M phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride PMSF 24 ml of 5M NaCl solution, 2.4 ml of 0.2 M ethylenediamine tetraacetate EDTA , 2.4 ml of 1 M spermidine and 2.4 ml of lysozyme 5 mg ml were added. The mixture was allowed to stand at 0 C for 1 hour, incubated at 37 C for 5 minutes and, further, destructed at OOC for 30 seconds using a ARTEX USA ultrasonic disintegrator. This lysate solution was centrifuged at 105,000 x g for 1 hour for collecting 66 ml of the supernatant.
