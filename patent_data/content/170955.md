## Description
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 3a,6,6,9a tetramethylperhydronaphto 2,1 b furan, a tricyclic decalinic ether of formula which process comprises the step of cyclising 1β 2 hydroxyethyl perhydro 2,5,5,8aβ tetramethyl 2β trans napthalenol by means of an acidic cyclisation agent in the presence of nitromethane. A mixture containing 3a,6,6,9a tetramethylperhydronaphto 2,1 b furan of formula together with minor amounts of its diastereoisomer of formula has been commercialized under the form of a perfume speciality base for over twenty years FIXATEUR 404 , origin Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland . The former of the above compounds is better known by its tradename AMBROX registered trademark of Firmenich SA whereas the latter is defined by analogy as iso AMBROX . Owing to its typical ambergris character of special radiance, AMBROX has become a perfume ingredient of great usefulness. Since its discovery see Helv. Chim. Acta Such a synthetic approach can be illustrated by means of the following simplified reaction pathway Thus, AMBROX, in spite of its exceptional fragrance properties, has remained so far a product of relatively limited use. The present invention brings a novel and original solution to the challenging problem set by its preparation. By using synthetic raw materials, the process of the invention overcomes the drawbacks of the known methods and constitutes therefore a useful economical alternative from the industrial viewpoint. The critical step of the invention process consists in the cyclisation of a diol of formula by means of an acidic cyclisation agent in the presence of nitromethane. Suitable acidic cyclisation agents include mineral protonic acids, carboxylic acids, acidic diatomaceous earth or acidic cationic resins. Derivatives of sulfonic acid can also be employed and to this effect p toluenesulfonic acid is preferred. By analogy with a known process see Sibiertseva et al., Chem. Abstr. group. Iso AMBROX thus formed, though possessing the typical qualitative characters of AMBROX itself, differs from it insofar as its perception level is concerned as shown in following table. From the above figures, it follows that the product obtained by the process of the invention possesses an odor power well superior to that of the isomeric compound obtained by the cyclisation described by Sibiertseva. The action of nitromethane in the above defined cyclisation promotes in the acidic reaction medium an epimerization of asymmetric group thus driving the reaction toward the formation of the desired isomer. Such an action is surprising and totally unexpected. We have noticed that the essential feature of nitromethane is to reduce the double bond formation subsequent to the dihydration of diol I according to the following reaction The reaction is carried out at a temperature higher than room temperature, lower though than the boiling point, at atmospheric pressure, of nitromethane. Typically, the chosen temperature is of between 50 and 90 According to a preferred mode, the cyclisation is effected by heating at the chosen temperature the mixture consisting of diol I , the acidic cyclisation agent and nitromethane. Diol of formula I , used as starting material in the above described process, is a known compound which can be obtained starting from a bicyclic carbinol of formula via ozonization followed by reduction by means, for example, of an alkali metal borohydride. The following reaction scheme illustrates the process for the preparation of said diol I . Intermediates II to V are novel chemical entities whereas keto ester VI has been described by R. W. Skeean et al. Tetrahedron Letters 525 8 1976 and it can be readily obtained, as indicated by the authors, from geranyl bromide or β cyclogeranyl bromide. A preferred embodiment of the process of the invention is described in the following example wherein temperatures are indicated in degrees centigrade and the abbreviations have the meaning common in the art. Into a 1 l flask was placed a suspension of 1.2 g 5 mM of sodium hydride in 70 ml of dimethylformamide. A solution of 12.27 g 48.7 mM of methyl perhydro 5,5,8aβ trimethyl 2 oxo 1β trans naphthalenecarboxylate in 30 ml of dimethylformamide was added at 5 10 A sample was recrystallized from ethyl acetate m.p. 100 101 A stirred mixture of 7.30 g 25 mM of methyl 1 allyl perhydro 5,5,8aβ trimethyl 2 oxo 1β trans naphthalenecarboxylate, 9.4 g 62 mM of calcium chloride dihydrate, and 90 ml of dimethylsulfoxide was heated at reflux for 75 min. It was poured into water, extracted with ether, dried over Na₂SO₄ and evaporated. Distillation of the remaining oil gave 5.39 g of a product having b.p. 100 115 Glc CARBOWAX column indicated a mixture of 82 of 1β allyl perhydro 5,5,8aβ trimethyl 2 trans naphthalenone and 13 of starting material. Separation was achieved by silica gel chromatography using hexane 2 ethyl acetate. 2.34 G 10 mM of the ketone obtained according to paragraph B above in 5 ml of ether was added to the Grignard reagent prepared from 0.36 g 15 mg atoms of magnesium and 0.9 ml 15 mM of iodomethane in 20 ml of ether. The mixture was heated at reflux for 30 min, then it was decomposed with aq. ammonium chloride solution and extracted with ether. Drying over Na₂SO₄, evaporation, and distillation of the residue afforded 2.47 g 98 of the desired carbinol, b.p. 105 A solution of 2.47 g 9.9 mM of the carbinol obtained according to paragraph C above, in 60 ml of methanol was ozonized at 20 A stirred mixture of 640 mg 2.5 mM of the product obtained according to paragraph D above, 20 mg of p toluenesulfonic acid, and 50 ml of nitromethane was heated at 80
