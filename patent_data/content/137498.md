DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONAND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an antibacterial compound of the formula EMI3.1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or amide thereof. Antibacterial R Z 4 amino 3 chloro 2 pentenedioic acid is obtained by growing under controlled conditions the microorganism, Streptomyces viridogenes MA5450, ATCC 39387 in a fermentation broth. The fermentation may be carried out in media containing suspended nutrient matter or in predominantly clear media wherein the medium is substantially free of suspended nutrient matter. Based on extensive taxonomic studies, the antibiotic producing microorganism is identified asStreptomyces viridogenes. A useful strain is designated MA 5450 in the culture collection of MERCK CO., Inc., Rahway, New Jersey. A culture thereof has been placed on permanent deposit with the culture collection of the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland 20852, and has been assigned Accession No. ATCC 39387.MORPHOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OFSTREPTOMYCES VIRIDOGENES MA5450, ATCC 39387 The morphological and cultural characteristics of Streptomyces viridogenes MA5450,ATCC 39387 are set forth below.

Such media contain sources of carbon, nitrogen and inorganic salts assimilable by the microorganism. Many fermentation media support production of R Z 4 amino 3 chloro 2 pentenedioc acid by Streptomyces viridogenes MA5450, ATCC 39387, and may be suitably adjusted within the ordinary skill of the fermentation chemist. In general, carbohydrates, for example, dextrose and lactose and starches as well as glycerol, pectin and peptonized milk either alone or in combination can be used as sources of assimilable carbon in the nutrient medium. The exact quantity of the carbon source or sources utilized in the medium depends in part upon the other ingredients of the medium but, in general, the amount of carbon source usually varies between about 1t and 6 by weight of the medium. These carbon sources can be used individually or several such carbon sources can be combined in the medium. Many proteinaceous materials may be used as nitrogen sources in the fermentation process.Suitable nitrogen sources include, for example, yeast extract, yeast hydrolysates, soybean flour, distillers solubles, corn steep, peptonized milk, lard water, peanut meal and tomato paste and the like. The sources of nitrogen, either alone or in combination, are used in amounts ranging from about 0.2 to 6 by weight of the aqueous medium. Among the nutrient inorganic salts which may be incorporated in the medium are the customary salts capable of yielding sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, sulfate, chloride, carbonate and the like ions. Also, there may be included trace metals such as cobalt, manganese and iron. The fermentation is carried out at temperatures ranging from about 20 to 370C however, for optimum results it is preferred to conduct the fermentation at temperatures of from about 240C to 320C. The pH of the nutrient media suitable for growing Streptomyces viridogenes MA5450,ATCC 39387 culture and producing the novel antibacterial compound of the present invention should be in the range of from about 4.0 to 7.0. Small scale fermentation of the antibiotic conveniently is carried out by inoculating a suitable nutrient medium with the antibiotic producing culture and, after transfer to a production medium, permitting fermentation to proceed at a constant temperature of about 280C on a shaker for several days. At the end of the incubation period, the antibiotic activity is isolated from the fermentation broth by techniques hereinafter described. The small scale fermentation may be conducted in a sterilized flask via a one, two, three or four stage seed development. The nutrient medium for the seed stage may be any suitable combination of carbon and nitrogen sources. The seed flask is shaken in a constant temperature chamber at about 280C until maximum growth is completed usually 1 3 days and some of the resulting growth is used to inoculate either a further seed stage or the production medium. Intermediate stage seed flasks, when used, are developed essentially in the same manner that is, part of the contents of the flask is used to inoculate either the next stage seed medium or the production medium.The inoculated production flasks are shaken at a constant temperature about 280C for several days usually 3 to 5 days and at the end of the incubation period the novel antibacterial compound of the present invention is isolated. For large scale work, it is preferable to conduct the fermentation in suitable tanks provided with an agitator and a means of aerating the fermentation medium. The nutrient medium is made up in the tank and sterilized by heating to about 1200C. Upon cooling, the sterilized medium is inoculated with a previously grown seed culture of the producing organism and fermentation is permitted to proceed for a period of several days 3 to 5 days, for example while agitating and or aerating the nutrient medium and maintaining the temperature at about 280C. EXAMPLE 1Fermentation Preparation of R Z 4 amino 3 chloro 2 pentenedioic acid As in the case with most Streptomyces antibiotic fermentations, more than one antibiotic can be produced by Streptomyces viridogenes MA5450,ATCC 39387. Fermentation, therefore, attempted to maximize production of the desired antibiotic while minimizing the production of interfering antibiotics. Enriched production of 4 amino 3 chloro 2pentenedioic acid occured when the above culture was inoculated into growth medium A, Table I below, incubated for 2 days at 280C with agitation and then used to inoculate 5 inoculum flasks containing production medium B, Table I below. Product was present after 24 hours of incubation. Fermentations were complete by 5 days of incubation at 280C with agitation. The cell wall active compound FR 900148 was enriched when the above growth medium was used to inoculate production medium C, Table I below, which was allowed to incubate for 2 days at 280C with agitation. The most consistent production of the antibiotic mixture occurred in production medium D,Table I below, under similar incubation conditions. Table I.

The filtrate 121 g solids contained both Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus activity and was treated with 250 g activated carbon. The slurry was filtered.Most of the Micrococcus activity was in the carbon filtrate whereas the Bacillus activity was reduced by one half. The filtrate was passed through an 800 ml Dowex 50 X12 H cycle column followed by one liter of water. The resin spent effluent was devoid of bioactivity. The resin was eluted with 10 liters of 2 pyridine and one liter fractions were taken. The initial eluate fractions were at pH 3.0 and contained only the Micrococcus activity. The four highest activity fractions were combined and evaporated to 50 ml 1.7 g solids . An equal volume of methanol was added and the mixture allowed to set in the refrigerator for 16 hours. The crystals formed were filtered and dried to yield 643 mg of product. THe crystals were subjected to lH nmr studies. Forty mg of crystals were dissolved in one ml H2O, heated and allowed to cool to room temperature to initiate large crystal formation. The solution was then put in the refrigerator for 72 hours. The large crystals formed were evaluated byX ray crystallography.B. FR 900148 FR 900148 was also isolated. The isolation was monitored by both Bacillus subtilis andMicrococcus luteus agar diffusion assays.Fermentation broth was centrifuged. The clear liquid 900 ml, 19.8 g solids was adjusted to pH 9.0 and passed through a 175 ml Dowex 1 X2 C1 resin followed by 400 ml H2O. The absorbed antibiotic was eluted with 800 ml of 3 NaCl, taking 200 ml fractions. The active fractions were combined, adjusted to pH 7.0 and evaporated to 45 ml. The concentrate was treated with an equal volume of methanol to precipitate salt and the clear liquid was evaporated to 30 ml. Twenty ml of the concentrate was passed through a 900 ml Biogel P 2 column collecting 10 ml fractions. The first peak fraction No. 54 contained an equal amount of Micrococcus andBacillus activity FR 900148 whereas the second peak contained increased amounts of Micrococcus activity R Z 4 amino 3 chloro 2 pentenedioic acid .Fraction No. 54 was freeze dried to yield 38 mg of product which was subjected to nmr analysis.
