# Power transmission chain belt.

## Abstract
A power transmission chain belt 30 , especially adapted to provide a drive and transmit power between the pulleys of a pulley transmission, such as a variable ratio pulley transmis sion. The chain belt is constructed of a plurality of ranks or sets 32, 36 of interleaved links 34 , each rank being joined to the next adjacent rank by pivot means 40 , such as round pins, or a pin and rocker, to permit articulation of the belt. Generally trapezoidal load bloacks 44, 45, 70, 80, 90 are located between the pivot means of each rank or set of links, which blocks have opposite edge surfaces 48, 50A, 50B, 72B, 92A to contact the flanges of the pulleys At least one load block has a differently dimensioned or arranged contact area than the other load blocks. This changes the generated noise pattern produced when the chain belt engages the pulley flanges.
