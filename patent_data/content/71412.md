# Novel sulphosuccinates and detergent compositions containing them.

## Abstract
The invention provides novel dialkyl sulpho succinates in which one alkyl group is C₆ and the other is C₈, both alkyl groups preferably being straight chain. The soluble salts of these materials are useful detergents, exhibiting outstand ingly good foaming performance, and may be used, for example, in shampoos, fabric washing compositions and, in particular, manual dishwashing compositions.
