# Fur like synthetic material and process of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A fur like synthetic sheet material is provided with numerous superfine synthetic pile fibres having fineness or thickness of about 0.0001 to 0.4 denier. The pile fibres, which are about 4 to 30 mm long, have crimps and are formed into bundle groups, while the crimps of the pile fibres are substantially in phase within each bundle group. A process for manufacture of the material involves the steps of 1 preparing a primary pile sheet having a primary pile formed from a mixture of islands in a sea type precursor fibres 50 with different heat shrinkage properties, each sea component 51 having a softening point lower than each island component 52 2 subjecting the primary pile sheet to heat treatment to soften the sea components and cause at least partial adhesion, whilst at the same time crimping the fibres 3 unbinding the precursors to generate superfine fibres.
