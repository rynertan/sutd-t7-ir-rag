# Measuring instrument using a pneumatically driven resonant element.

## Abstract
The problem of providing a process control instrument employing a vibratable string 41 that is safe in explosive environments is solved by using a continuous gas stream or series of gas impulses through a port 59 , such as a jet nozzle, to impinge on the string which has its tension and therefore its resonant frequency determined by a process parameter as sensed, for example by pressure in a bellows 25 . Variations in the alignment between the port and string produce different modes of vibration, one being particularly suitable for process measurement. In one example, an optical sensor provides an intrinsically safe instrument for measuring the frequency of vibration.
