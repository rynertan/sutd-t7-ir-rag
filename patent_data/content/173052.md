## Description
MICROCOMPUTER CLOCK CIRCUITBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a clock circuit with a power down state for use with a microcomputer. Microcomputers, in particular integrated circuit type microcomputers such as the NEC 7501, have a clock input for providing the clock pulses necessary to operate in a conventional manner. One disadvantage of continually applying clock pulses to the microcomputer circuitry, even when the microcomputer has halted and does not provide an output to the remaining circuitry, is that the power consumption is considerably higher than when the clock is off.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The main object of the present invention is to provide a clock circuit for use with a microcomputer for saving power consumption when the microcomputer is in a halt mode that retains memory and does not require clock pulses. In accordance with the present invention, this and other objects are carried out by providing a circuitry which disables the clock pulses into the clock when a halt mode is sensed so as to reduce power consumption until such time as the computer returns to an operating mode. The circuit in accordance with the present invention allows the user to turn on the microcomputer and the clock together, with the microcomputer latching the clock on. When a halt instruction is reached, the microcomputer disables the clock and after a time delay the clock turns off. The advantage of this circuit in accordance with the present invention is that the invention allows the computer clock to be turned off to save power and the computer clock may be restarted with a minimum parts cost. In a preferred embodiment, the computer may sense the crystal frequency ramp up or a passive time constant can obliterate this window. These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following discussion of the present invention taken with the drawing wherein BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The Figure is a schematic of the clock circuit in accordance with the present invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring now to the Figure, the microcomputer 10 is preferably a NEC 7501 having a clock input pin 67, a halt indicating output pin 9 and an interrupt 0 input pin 60. As is conventional, an on off pushbutton 15 is provided which connects to the positive logic voltage V when pressed, to indicate at interrupt 0 that the microcomputer 10 is to start. The output from the pushbutton 15 is also applied to the logic formed by NOR gates 11 and 12. NOR gates 11 and 12 are initially reset to a state wherein the output of gate 11 is a logic 1 and the output of gate 12 is a logic 0. As a result the output of NOR gate 13 is a 0 and the output of NOR gate 14 is a 1. The output of crystal oscillator 16 is fed to the input of NOR gate 13, however because of the fact that gate 11 is presenting a 1 to the input of gate 13, the output thereof is always 0. Thus no clock pulses are input to the microcomputer 10. Upon the closing of pushbutton switch 15, an interrupt is placed at pin 60 of the microcomputer 10 and the logic formed by gates 11 and 12 is reset so that the output of gate 11 is now at a logic 0. This enables oscillator 16 to start oscillating. These pulses are thereafter inverted by gate 14 and presented to the clock input of the microcomputer 10. The microcomputer 10 can now operate in its standard operating mode with its clock. When the microcomputer goes into a halt mode and a halt instruction is output at the corresponding output pin 9 thereof, which goes from a logic 0 to a logic 1, this will act to reset the flip flop formed by gates 11 and 12 to disable the clock ouput of gate 13. However, due to the presence of the capacitor C at the input of gate 12, the threshold voltage for resetting the flip flop formed by gates 11 and 12 will not be reached until after a delay which is chosen to be suitable to the microcomputer to be carry out all of the functions that must be carried out before the clock can be shut off. The microcomputer is now in a mode where memory is retained, but power consumption is saved. If one wants to resume operation of the microcomputer 10, this can be done manually by closing on off pushbutton 15. It will be appreciated that the instant specification and claims are set forth by way of illustration and not limitation, and that various modifications and changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
