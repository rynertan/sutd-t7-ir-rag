## Description
PROCESS FOR XE PREPARATION OF CARDBOARD OF CHE CORRUGATED TYPE The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of cardboard of the corrugated type, having a high resistance to humidity, using fibres of thermoplastic synthetic polymers According to a known process which is described in Italian Patent Application No. 23339 A 77, it is possible to obtain a cardboard of the above indicated type using as the paper forming the liners or flat covers and the corrugated medium or wavy element sheets of thermoplastic synthetic fibres or mixtures of cellulose fibres with such thermoplastic fibres. Such sheets may be thermo treated in order to melt at least part of the thermoplastic fibres. The heat of thermo treatment may be carried out in the absence of pressure, for instance in a warm air tunnel or by means of infrared lamps, and optionally followed by a compression or the treatment may be conducted under simultaneous pressure, operating for instance on roller calenders, the pressure being applied by one of the rollers or cylinders, or in discontinuous plate presses, or on continuous band presses, with pressure values of at least 0.1 kg cm in roller calenders, and of at least 0.1 kg cm2 in plate or band presses. When the sheets are used for producing the corrugated medium of the cardboard, they are heat formed on special embossed or grooved heated cylinders which form the so called corrugating group , well known to those skilled in the manufacture of corrugated cardboard, also of the conventional type. The cylinders or rollers of the corrugating group in general operate at a temperature greater than that at which the thermoplastic polymer constituting the synthetic fibres present in the sheet becomes plastic or softens, as a result of which the sheets may acquire in a permanent way the required undulated or corrugated structure. In general, the first of the liners that form the corrugated cardboard is welded to the tips of the corrugated medium in the corrugating group itself by thermo melting of the thermoplastic fibres contained in it, while the second liner is welded to the opposite tips of the corrugated medium in a separate operation. The thermo welding and the heat treatment of the sheets, in particular of the sheet that forms the corrugated medium, with the consequential melting of the thermoplastic fibres present in it, permit a cardboard of the undulated or corrugated type to be obtained having good mechanical properties under high humidity. However, in realizing such a process there occur considerable practical difficulties in the thermo welding of the second liner onto the corrugated medium, after the first liner has been welded onto it. In fact, the thermo welding of the second liner to the tips of the corrugated medium must necessarily be carried out, instead of at the corrugating group, at the so called hot plates where the corrugated medium, at the required welding temperature, which in general is 200 300C higher than that necessary for melting the thermoplastic polymer present, and under the minimal pressure required about 40 g sq.cm , tends to collapse and thus to become permanently warped The present invention provides a process for the preparation of cardboard of the corrugated type, using paper containing thermoplastic synthetic fibres, which comprises effecting thermo adhesion of a a corrugated medium comprising, at least at the outer layer intended for adhesion, a sheet of fibrous material formed of synthetic fibres of at least one thermoplastic polymer, or of a mixture of such fibres containing up to 95 by weight of cellulose fibres, at least part of the said fibres being in the fusion bonded state and b at least one liner comprising, at least at the outer layer intended for adhesion to the tips of the corrugated medium, a sheet of fibrous material formed of synthetic fibres of at least one thermoplastic polymer, or of a mixture of such fibres containing up to 95 by weight of cellulose fibres wherein the thermo adhesion is carried out by interposing between the tips of the corrugated medium and the surface of the liner to be adhered a film of at least one synthetic thermoplastic polymer having the following characteristics a a melting temperature lower than the melting temperature of the thermoplastic polymer constituting the synthetic fibres present in the liner and in the corrugated medium b a viscosity in the molten state of less than 1 x 108 poises, measured in a capillary viscosimeter, at a velocity gradient less than or equal to 10 1 seconds, and at a temperature of from a temperature exceeding by 10 C the melting temperature of such polymer to a temperature exceeding by 200C the melting temperature of the thermoplastic polymer constituting the synthetic fibres present in the liner and in the corrugated medium c a surface tension not exceeding by more than 5 dynes cm the surface tension of the thermoplastic polymer constituting the synthetic fibres present in the liner and in the corrugated medium, measured at the same temperature d a solubility parameter measured at a temperature of 250C which is in a ratio to the solubility parameter of the thermoplastic polymer constituting the synthetic fibres present in the liner and in the corrugated medium of from 0085 1 to 1.15 1, extremes included and wherein the assembly thus obtained, at least in correspondence with the points of contact of the liner with the tips of the corrugated medium, is heated at a temperature of from a temperature exceeding by 1000 the melting temperature of the thermoplastic polymer constituting the film to a temperature exceeding by 200C the melting temperature of the thermoplastic polymer constituting the synthetic fibres present in the liner and in the corrugated medium. It has thus now been found that it is possible to achieve the thermo welding of the liner to the tips of the corrugated medium operating on the hot plates without the drawback previously described if there is interposed between the tips of the corrugated medium and the liner a thermoplastic synthetic polymer film having the following characteristics a a melting temperature lower than the melting temperature of the thermoplastic polymer constituting the synthetic fibres present in the liner and in the corrugated medium b a viscosity in the molten state, measured in a capillary viscosimeter, at a velocity gradient equal to or less than 10 1 seconds, at a temperature of from a temperature exceeding by 1000 the melting temperature of such polymer to a temperature exceeding by 200C the melting temperature of the thermoplastic fibres present in the liner and in the corrugated medium, of less than 1 x 108 poises, preferably less than 1 x 105 poises c a surface tension not exceeding by more than 5 dynes cm that of the polymer constituting the thermoplastic fibres present in the liner and in the corrugated medium, measured at the same temperature and d a solubility parameter which is in a ratio to the solubility parameter of the polymer constituting the thermoplastic fibres present in the liner and in the corrugated medium of from 0.85 1 to 1.15 1, extremes included, such parameters being measured at 250C. By interposing such a film it is possible to obtain the adhesion between the sheet and the corrugated medium by operating at lower temperatures than those previously required, in particular at those ranging from a temperature exceeding by OOC the melting temperature of the polymer constituting the film to a temperature exceeding by 200C the melting temperature of the polymer constituting the fibres present in the liner and in the corrugated medium. In this way the above mentioned drawbacks are greatly reduced or completely avoided. In particular it is possible, and even preferable, to operate from a temperature exceeding by 1000 the melting temperature of the polymer constituting the film to a temperature equal to the melting temperature of the polymer constituting the fibres, when the melting temperature of the polymer constituting the film is lower by at least 100C than the melting temperature of the polymer constituting the fibres0 For instance, when operating in the presence of a high density polyethylene film having a melting temperature of 1350C, and using polypropylene fibres having a melting temperature of 1650C, the adhesion may be effected at 145 to 16500. With temperature values within this preferred range it is possible to achieve the adhesion even at temperatures below the melting temperatures of the thermoplastic fibres, without destroying their morphology. As to the fibrous material present in the sheets that constitute the liner and the corrugated medium it may consist only of synthetic fibres of at least one thermoplastic polymer, or of a mixture of such fibres with up to 95 by weight of cellulose fibres, referred to the total mixture of fibres. Mineral fillers, pigments and the additives commonly used in conventional cellulose papers may be present in the sheets, admixed with the aforesaid fibrous material. The sheets that constitute the liner and the corrugated medium may be of the elementary or monolayer type, that is they consist of a single homogeneous layer of the fibrous material having the above defined composition, or of the multi layer type, that is they consist of a plurality of layers of fibrous material of different composition. In the latter case, it is understood that at least one of the external layers forming such sheets, and particularly the layer that constitutes the face of the sheet to be made to adhere, shall have the above defined composition and that on this layer will be deposited the thermoplastic film. In order to distinguish this layer from other layers, such a layer will be referred to as the layer intended for the adhesion. Thus, in referring the characteristics a to d of the polymer constituting the film to the thermoplastic synthetic fibres present in the liners and in the corrugated medium, by such fibres are meant those present in the liners and corrugated medium when they consist of mono layer sheets, and only those present in the layers intended for adhesion when the liners and the corrugated medium are formed by multi layer sheets. The remaining layers that form such structures, not being directly involved in the adhesion process, may consist of cellulose fibres only, or of synthetic fibres alone, whether thermoplastic or not, or of a blend of such fibres in any proportion4 Natural fibres of a type different from the cellulosic type, for instance wool fibres, may also be present in the mono layer sheets or in the multi layer sheets, in substitution of not more than 50 by weight of the cellulose fibres. At the moment of the thermo adhesion, at least part of the thermoplastic fibres present in the sheet or in the layer intended for the adhesion, and constituting the corrugated medium, are in a fusion bonded state as a consequence of the thermo formation process used for the formation of the corrugated structure starting from a flat sheet and may be either in the solid condition or still in the fused condition. The thermoplastic fibres present in the sheet or in the layer intended for the adhesion, and constituting the liner, may likewise, at least partially, be in a thermomolten state, following some preceding thermal treatment and or a calendering of the sheets themselves, or they may remain unaltered, in which case they may or may not undergo a thermofusion during the dwell period of the liner between the hot plates or in the corrugating group during the thermo welding to the tips of the corrugated medium. Although the advantages derived from the interposition of the above defined thermoplastic film between the tips of the corrugated medium and the liner are obtained chiefly in the bonding operations of the liners carried out on the hot plates, it may be convenient to utilize the method also in the bonding of the liners with the corrugated medium effected on the corrugating group, feeding to this group, between the liner and the tips of the corrugated medium, a thermoplastic polymer film having the characteristics a to d . In these operations, the film is preferably pre heated at a temperature near the temperature at which the thermoadhesion is to be effected, in such a way that it melts or softens and thus adheres to the liner face on which it has been deposited. After having effected the thermoadhesion of the film to the tips of the corrugated medium, the fusion of the film may be completed, if necessary, during the passage of the assembly through the hot plates, during the course of the bonding operation of the second liner to the corrugated medium The advantage of applying the use of a polymeric film of the above indicated type and in the above indicated way also to the thermoadhesion of the corrugated medium with a liner in the corrugating group, also in this case will be that of enabling an operation at much lower temperatures than those so far required for such an operation0 Preparation of the sheets, whether mono or multi layer, can be effected according to conventional papermaking methods, starting from dispersions in water, or in another inert liquid of thermoplastic synthetic fibres or mixtures thereof with cellulose fibres, using for the purpose continuous flat or curved table machines.Aqueous suspensions containing from 0.7 to 1.5 by weight of fibrous material are preferably used As synthetic fibres constituting in whole or in part the sheets to be used in the process of the invention, it is possible to employ fibres of the conventional type in the form of staple but preferably use is made of fibrils or fibrids of thermoplastic synthetic polymers having a specific surface area of at least 1 m2 g. Such fibrils of fibrids are products long known as substituents of cellulose in the preparation of paper or of related products. Generally their length ranges from 1 to 10 mm and their mean apparent diameter from 1 to 500 p . The fibrils employable in the present process can be obtained according to any one of the several processes described in the literature. In this connection mention is made of the methods described in British PatentNos. 868 651 and 1 287 917, and in German PatentApplication No. 2 208 553, according to which the fibres in question, otherwise called fibrids , are obtained by precipitation of polymers from their solutions, or during the polymerization of the polymers itself, operating in the presence of shearing stresses and furthermore inBritish Patent Nos0 891 943 and 1 262 531, in U.S.PatentNos. 3 770 856, 3 750 383 and 3 808 091, in BelgianPatent NoO 789 808, in French Patent NoO 2 176 858 and in German Patent Application No. 2 343 543, according to which the aforesaid fibrils are obtained in the state of more or less coherent aggregates or of fibrilled filamentary structures plexifilaments by extruding through a spinneret, of solutions, emulsions or dispersions of the polymers in one or more liquid media, in conditions of nearly instantaneous evaporation of the existing liquid phase flash spinning processes . In such a case the fibrous aggregates or plexifilaments so obtained can be easily disaggregated into discontinuous or elementary fibrils, having a surface area of at least 1 m2 g, by means of cutting and or refining operations. Other methods by which it is possible to obtain such fibrils directly are those described in ItalianPatent No. 947 919 and in Italian Patent ApplicationNo. 29594 A 74, as well as in British Patent Nos.1 355 912 and 1 355 913. The thermoplastic fibres, and in particular such fibrils or fibrids, may contain incorporated therein inorganic fillers such as kaolin, talc and titanium dioxide, in amounts up to 70 by weight referred to the weight of the fibres thus filled. Blends of such fibres with thermoplastic fibres of the conventional type may be used as well. As cellulose fibres it is possible to utilize all the ones usually employed for making papers of the conventional type. The thermoplastic fibres present in the mono layer sheets forming the liners and the corrugated medium, or in the layers intended for the adhesion when the liners and the corrugated medium are constituted of multi layer sheets, may be made of the same polymer, or of polymers of a different nature, provided that the polymer constituting the film meets all the conditions from a to d defined hereinabove. When the thermoplastic fibres present in the sheets or layers are blends of fibres of different polymers, the polymer constituting the film to be interposed between the sheets or layers must meet all the conditions from a to d defined hereinabove, in respect of at least one of the types of thermoplastic fibres which are present or of the polymer forming such thermoplastic fibres . In the case that the individual thermoplastic fibres should be made of a mixture of polymers instead of one type only of polymer, what is specified at characteristics a to d about the melting temperatures, the surface tension values and the solubility parameters of the polymers constituting the fibres is to be understood as referred to the corresponding values exhibited by such a mixture of polymers0 The thermoplastic polymer constituting the film may be any film forming thermoplastic polymer, preferably having a crystallinity of at least 20 , provided that it exhibits the characteristics a to d with respect to the thermoplastic polymer constituting the fibres present in the liner and in the corrugated medium. Examples of polymers from which the film can be prepared are the olefinic polymers, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, the vinyl polymers, such as polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, polymethylmethacrylate, polyethylacrylate, polystyrene and furthermore the polyamides, polytetrafluoroethylene, the polyester resins, and mixtures of such polymers. The melting temperature of a polymer is assumed to be the temperature at which the disappearance of the last crystallite in the polymer is observed under an optical microscope. The solubility parameter of a polymer is expressed by the square root of the ratio between the cohesion energy of the molecules and the molar volume, and is often used to determine the characteristics of compatibility of polymers and solvents. General methods of such determination are described by J0 Brandrup and E.H0 Tmmergut in PolymerHandbook , Inters, Publisher, 1966, paragraph 4, pages 341 and following. One particular determination method based on the principle of additivity of the contributions of the chemical groups, atoms and bonds present in the molecules to the total molar attraction forces was suggested and described by P,A, Small in Journal of Applied Chemistry 3, 77, 1953o There is reported hereinbelow the values of the solubility parameter at 250C of some polymers, values calculated according to P.A. Small and which are referred to for the purposes of this invention. Polymer solubility parameterPolyvinyl acetateEMI15.1 Polymethylmethacrylate 9.22Polyethylene 8.05Polystyrene 9.01Polypropylene 9.2Polytetrafluoroethylene 6.2Polyvinyl alcohol 12.6Polyvinyl chloride 10.2 The thermoplastic polymer film can be obtained according to any conventional method used for filmforming of the polymer, such as extrusion or moulding. The thickness of the film is not critical.However, films having a thickness not exceeding 150you and in particular of from 5 to 40 1 , are preferable since they permit the preparation of bonded sheets with shorter dwell times at the operating temperature. The synthetic fibres present in the liners and in the corrugated medium to be caused to adhere according to the process of the present invention are preferably prepared from thermoplastic polymers having at least 20 crystallinity, such as low or high density polyethylene, polypropylene essentially consisting of isotactic macromolecules, ethylene propylene random or block copolymers, poly 4 methyl 1 pentene, polyamides, polyesters, polyacrylonitrile, polyurethanes, polycarbonates, vinyl resins, such as polyvinyl chloride and polyvinyl acetate, ethylene vinylacetate copolymers, acrylic resins in general, and polyethers. As previously specified, the temperature at which the thermo adhesion between the liners and the corrugated medium is effected ranges from a temperature exceeding by 10 C the melting temperature of the polymer constituting the film to a temperature exceeding, at the most, by 200C the melting temperature of the thermoplastic fibres present in the liners and in the corrugated medium, it being understood that such fibres, in the case that the liners and or corrugated medium have a multi layer structure, are the thermoplastic fibres present in the layers or sheets of those structures which are in contact with the film surface. This temperature must be attained at least at the points at which the tips of the corrugated medium rest, through the interposed film, against the surface of the liner. Preferably there is simultaneously applied a slight pressure in correspondence with those points, in 2 general not exceeding 40 g cm2. The actual temperature at which the heating is carried out is selected, within the defined range, from amongst those at which the polymer constituting the film assumes the previously defined values of viscosity b and surface tension c , in case such values would not take place at all the heating temperatures comprised in the above mentioned range. In such a case the temperature at which thermoadhesion or bonding is achieved may be established on the basis of preliminary determinations of the viscosity and surface tension carried out on the polymer constituting the film. The process of the present invention may be applied to the preparation of cardboard of the corrugated type having a plurality of corrugated media, in which process the thermo adhesion of these latter to the liners by means of interposed thermoplastic polymeric films may be achieved either operating on the corrugating group or at the hot plates of the corrugating machine. The invention will be further described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figures I, II and III respectively show schematically apparatus for carrying out various embodiments of the process according to the invention In Figure I there is shown apparatus for the preparation of corrugated cardboard, by thermoheating a second liner at the hot plates of heating apparatus.

The invention will be further described with reference to the following illustrative Examples0 EXAMPLE 1 By means of a flat three jet paper machine there was prepared a three layered paper which, after drying, exhibited the following characteristics overall weight 220 g sq.mt weight of the two outside layers 60 g sq.mt thickness of the outside layers 98 A composition of the outside layers unbleached conifer cellulose fibres 35 by weight high density polyethylene fibrils having a melting temperature of 1350C having a mean ponderal length of 3 mm, a mean apparent diameter of 16u and a specific surface area of 6 sq.mt g, and having incorporated therein 30 by weight of kaolin powder 65 by weight weight of inner layer 100 g sq.mt thickness of inner layer 100 A composition of inner layer only unbleached conifer cellulose fibres. By means of a second flat two jet paper machine there was prepared a two layer paper which, after dyring, exhibited the following characteristics overall weight 180 g sq.mt weight of 1st layer 80 g sq4mt thickness of 1st layer 145 VU composition of the 1st layer unbleached conifer cellulose 35 by weight fibres same polyethylene fibrils 65 by weight used for the three layer paper described above weight of 2nd layer 100 g sq.mt. thickness of 2nd layer 160 composition of the 2nd layer only unbleached conifer cellulose fibres. The polyethylene fibrils were prepared by means of the process described in Italian Patent No. 947 919, and were made dispersible in water by surface treatment with acetalized polyvinyl alcohol, as described inItalian Patent No. 1 006 878. The papers were obtained starting from dispersions in water containing about 1 by weight of fibrous material. The three layered paper described herein above was conveyed to a corrugating unit of the type Wave A , which operated at a temperature of 1800 C, and where the three layered paper was thermo formed into a corrugated sheet0 At the same time, to the corrugating unit there was also conveyed a sheet of the two jet paper described above first liner arranged in such a way as to contact the tips of the three jet paper through the surface of its first layer, which contained the polyethylene fibrils, so as to cause the thermo adhesion of this layer to the tips of the corrugated medium0 A second sheet of the two layered paper previously prepared was heated up to 1800C in a hot air tunnel and then calendered under a pressure of about 80 kg sq.cm, cooled down and then continuously fed, as a second liner, to a hot plate device together with the complex formed by the corrugated medium and the first liner, coming from the corrugating unit. The second liner was fed to the hot plates with the surface of the first layer, containing the polyethylene fibrils, facing the tips of the corrugated medium lst liner complex, on which tips it must rest. Before entering the hot plates, onto this surface was deposited a continuous film, fed from a reel and having a thickness of 20you , and a width equal to that of the paper sheets, the film consisting of a low density polyethylene density 0.906 , having the following characteristics melting temperature 1100C viscosity, measured in the temperature less than range of from 120 to 155 C, in a 0.8 x 105 capillary viscosimeter, under a poises velocity gradient equal to or less than 10 1 seconds surface tension equal to that of the high density polyethylene forming the fibrils present in the sheets, measured at the same temperature solubility parameter in a ratio of 0.98 to that of the polyethylene that forms the above indicated fibrils, at 250C, The heating section of the hot plates was 10 mt long and was heated by means of over heated steam at a temperature of 1600 C. The second liner, with the polyethylene film resting on its surface, and the corrugated medium 1st liner complex were fed to the hot plates at a rate of 60 mt minute, with a dwell time in the heating section of 6 seconds. The maximum temperature observed by an optical pyrometer on the inner face of the second liner, in correspondence with the contact or rest points of the tips of the corrugated medium on that face, was 1350cm The pressure exerted in correspondence with these points by the rollers of the heating device was 40 g sq.cm. At the outlet of the cooling zone, the cardboard thus obtained had a total thickness of 5 mm, and all its waves had a regular and unaltered shape. The value of the adhesion of the second liner onto the corrugated medium, as a mean value of determinations carried out on 10 waves, proved to be 600 150 g cm. EXAMPLE 2 comparative Example 1 was repeated, except that between the second liner and the corrugated medium no polyethylene film or film of any other polymer was inserted. No adhesion of the second liner to the corrugated medium was obtained. EXAMPLE 3 comparative Example 1 was repeated, except that no polyethylene film or film of any other polymer was inserted between the second liner and the tips of the corrugated medium, while the hot plates were operated at a maximum temperature, measured on the inner surface of the second liner in correspondence with the points of contact between this surface and the tips of the corrugated medium, of 17O0C. At such a temperature the adhesion was about 50 g cm while the waves appeared unaltered0 This operation was repeated under the same conditions, except that the temperature, instead of being 1700C, was equal to 1900C, The cardboard thus obtained had a total thickness of 4.2 mm, while all the waves appeared collapsed and heavily deformed. The value of the adhesion of the second liner onto the corrugated medium, as a mean value of determinations carried out on 10 waves, proved to be 450 120 g cm.
