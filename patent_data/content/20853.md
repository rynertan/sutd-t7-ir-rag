# PROCESS FOR EXTRUDING AND CROSS LINKING POLYMERS

## Abstract
Cross linked articles of thermoplastic polymers are economically prepared by extruding vertically a mixture of polymer and cross linking agent at a temperature lower than that at which cross linking of the polymer occurs and by then carrying out the cross linking of the extruded product in a separate step by introducing it vertically in a heated bath of an inert liquid having a specify gravity, at the cross linking temperature, ranging from 10 to 20 of the specific gravity of the extruded product at that temperature.
