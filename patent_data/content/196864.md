## Description
ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE MEDIATED PROCESSING AND SECRETION OF RECOMBINANT PROTEINS, DNA SEQUENCES FOR USE THEREIN AND CELLS TRANSFORMED USING SUCH SEQUENCES The invention relates to the production of heterologous proteins in bacteria using recombinant techniques. More specifically, it relates to the use of alkaline phosphatase A gene pho A control and leader sequences to mediate processing and secretion of chimeric proteins resulting from alkaline p hosphatase leader heterologous protein fusions. Recombinant production of chimeric or mature proteins containing polypeptides of desired amino acid sequence derived from heterologous sources is now well established. However, the resulting mature or chimeric proteins are. as a general rule, not secreted into the periplasmic space or into the medium. but rather accumulated intracellularly. often in the form of insoluble particles, variously known as inclusion or refractile bodies. These proteins are often troublesome to purify, at the minimum requiring that the cells be disrupted and separation be conducted from a plethora of intracellularly disposed protein materials, and, further, once purified may be deficient in biological activity, presumably due to inappropriate three dimensional confirmation.The severity of the problems associated with this form of recombinant production is variable but virtually always present to some degree when ATG preceded amature coding sequences. or fusion proteins with. for example. N terminal sequences of non secreted bacterial polypeptides such as ss galactosidase are placed downstream of bacterial promoters It was early realized that at least the purification problem with respect to recombinantly produced proteins could be simplified by effecting the secretion of the protein produced. U.S.Patents 4,411.994 and 4,33B,397 to Gilbert. et al disclose the use of the penicillinase gene in pBR322 to produce fusion proteins presumably carried to the periplasmic space by the penicillinase leader sequence, using preproinsulin cDNA coding sequences inserted into thePstI site of pBR322. The resulting fusions containing variable numbers of glycine residues between the penicillinase and insulin sequences due to the method of insertion are indeed found in the periplasmic space of the transformed cells. Biological activity was not an issue. as the presence of the fusions was verified using immunological reactivity. The possibility of using the genes encoding other bacterial secreted proteins.including alkaline phosphatase A, is mentioned, but no description of how such utilization could be achieved is given. Only a limited number of bacterial proteins are normally secreted. In E. coli, these proteins include penicillinase when present , alkaline phosphatase. and various transport proteins In Bacillus they further include amylase and subtilisin. These proteins.when produced natively are preceded by fused signal or leader peptides which are lost in the process of transporting the relevant protein across the cellular membrane. In gram negative bacteria. such as E. coli, where the cytoplasmic membrane is encased in an outer cell membrane wall. the intervening volume being designated the periplasmic space , this transport results in the presence of the protein in the periplasmic space. In gram positive bacteria where the outer membrane is absent, however, the protein is secreted directly into the medium. An attempt was made to utilize the alkaline phosphatase phoA gene product leader sequence to effect secretion of a foreign polypeptide by Ohsuye. K., et al, Nucleic Acids Res 1983 11 1263. The coding sequence for a neo endorphin, a decapeptide hormone, was synthesized in vitro and ligated into vectors so as to produce fusion proteins of the endorphin with the major portion of the N terminal sequence of alkaline phosphatase preceded by the DhoA leader. The resulting chimeric proteins were successfully processed by removal of the signal, but were not transported to the periplasmic space. Again, biological activity of the resultant protein was not an issue. It would be desirable to provide a system and method whereby recombinantly produced heterologous protein sequences are both secreted to ease purification and produced in biologically active form with proper folding. It appears from the results of the present invention that these goals are related. Accordingly, an expression system is required which results in processing and secretion of the heterologous protein produced thus providing a readily accessible source of correctly conformed material. The phoA constructions described below are capable of providing this result for susceptible heterologous sequences. Disclosure of the Invention The invention provides a procaryotic expression system suitable for efficient production of desired heterologous proteins. The mature forms of susceptible heterologous polypeptide sequences are secreted through the cellular membrane in biologically active and soluble form and are thus readily purified. They are usable without the necessity for employing specialized procedures to correct conformational deficiencies attributable to host cell post translation conditions.A pivotal feature of the expression system is the phoA leader sequence which is ligated into reading frame with the desired mature coding sequence. Thus. in one aspect, the invention relates to an expression system for heterologous mature coding sequences which system comprises the phoA leader sequence upstream of. contiguous with, and in reading frame with the desired coding sequence. The expression system may also include the phoA promoter operably linked to the fused coding sequence and or the phoA terminator downstream from and operably linked with the coding sequence. Other bacterial promoters and terminators or positive retroregulators may be substituted for the phoA controls. The expression system is typically disposed on a vector suitable to procaryotic hosts containing a compatible replicon and.desirably. a selectable marker. The invention. in other aspects. includes such expression vectors and hosts transformed with them. The invention also relates to active, soluble, heterologous proteins produced by the expression system of the invention when resident in these hosts. The invention also relates to methods for producing such proteins, and to methods for improving the quality of recombinantly produced heterologous proteins.Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1 shows the coding and amino acid sequence of the phoA leader altered to facilitate use in the expression system of the invention.

Figure 9 shows the construction of an intermediate vector containing IL 2 encoding sequence.Modes of Carrying Out the InventionA. Definitions As used herein, susceptible protein refers to a protein which has the appropriate amino acid sequence to permit interaction with bacterially derived phoA leader sequences to result in signal sequence processing and secretion of the susceptible protein. While the nature of the sequence related factor indigenous to the susceptible protein enabling this cooperation is not at present understood, it is clear that certain heterologous proteins are capable of interacting with the signal sequences derived from a variety of bacterial leaders, while others are incapable of doing so. Thus.proteins which are processed and secreted by phoA leader are also processed and secreted in processes mediated by amylase and penicillinase leaders. The converse is true. non susceptible proteins are resistant and are found as fusion proteins with the pertinent leader sequence intracellularly. Examples of susceptible proteins include human growth hormone and TNF. Examples of non susceptible proteins include IL 2. Secretion refers to transport through the cytoplasmic membrane. Whether or not the protein appears in the medium is dependent on the presence or absence of an outer membrane in the presence of outer membrane the secreted protein will be found in the periplasm, in the absence of outer membrane it will be in the medium. alkaline phosphatase A gene ohoA refers to the alkaline phosphatase structural gene of E. coli K12 as. for example. disclosed by Kikuchi, Y., et al,Nucleic Acids Res 1981 9 5671 5678. The structural gene is located at 8.5 minutes on the E. coli genetic map Bachmann, B. J., et al. Hicrobiol Rev 1980 44 1 56 and its native expression is relatively complex. However. the promoter and N terminal regions have been sequenced Kikuchi. Y.. et al, supra and the sequence of the signal peptide deduced Inouye. H..et al. J Bacteriol 1982 149 434 439 . The definition herein encompasses not only the specific structural gene and portions thereof. but functional equivalents derived from other bacterial sources or synthesized in vitro.It is understood that minor modifications may be made in the nucleotide sequences without affecting functionality, and that sequences derived from different strains or species of procaryotic cells may. and indeed almost surely do, contain sequences not absolutely identical to that of the above mentioned source. In addition, in connection with the invention herein. modifications have been made to this sequence to provide suitable restriction cleavage sites. wherein these modifications do not result in loss of functionality. Of relevance to the present invention are the following regions of the alkaline phosphatase structural gene the promoter. the ribosome binding site, the leader encoding sequence, and the terminator sequence.The nucleotide sequence of the 520 bp fragment which includes the promoter. ribosome binding site, and signal encoding are disclosed in Kikuchi. Y., supra . The nucleotide sequence encoding the leader. modified to provide a NarI site is shown in Figure 1. This modification permits coding sequences other than that for alkaline phosphatase to be substituted in reading frame with leader. and in that sense the leader encoding sequence is still functional. However, conversion to the NarI site prevents processing of the preprotein with respect to alkaline phosphatase itself since the codon for the N terminal arginine of the alkaline phosphatase sequence is thereby converted to that for proline.Functionality with respect to inserted sequences is not impaired as this portion of the NarI site is eliminated in the 3junctions. Operably linked refers to juxtaposition wherein the functionality of the operably linked subjects are preserved. Thus, promoter operably linked to a coding sequence results in expression of the coding sequence under control of the promoter desired protein operably linked to leader sequence refers to the protein disposed at the C terminus of the leader. Positive retroregulator conventionally referred to as terminator operably linked to a coding sequence permits the positive retroregulator to enhance effective expression. Cells . cell cultures , ghost cells . recombinant host cells refer to subject cells for recombinant DNA manipulations. As would be apparent from the context. these cells may be candidates for. or resultants of, transfer of new DNA sequences according to recombinant techniques. Techniques which are suitable for DNA uptake by cells include. most prominently. in vitro transformation, however other techniques such as transduction or conjugation may also be used. The definition further includes the progeny of the cells directly referred to. It is understood that such progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content to their parents, but such progeny are included in the definition so long as alterations due, for example. to accidental or deliberate mutation do not destroy the ability of the cells to exhibit the properties conferred by the DNA introduced. in a manner similar to that exhibited by their parents.B. General DescriPtion The invention provides the leader sequence for the PhoA gene in reading frame with a desired heterologous peptide. The DhoA promoter and terminator sequences may also be used advantageously, although alternate promoters and positive retroregulators may be substituted which are compatible with bacterial expression. The resulting constructs provide. when transformed into procaryotic hosts. the opportunity to obtain the desired coding sequence in a secreted, biologically active, soluble form free of leader sequence. This result, yielding secreted protein, is dependent on the peptide being susceptible to processing in conjunction with leader. as set forth above. The amino acid sequence characterizing human growth hormone and tumor necrosis factor are exemplary of susceptible peptide. IL 2 sequences are not susceptible to such processing. In the approach illustrated below, vectors are provided which contain the phoA promoter, PhoA leader sequence and DhoA terminator with suitable restriction sites for insertion of the desired coding sequence in reading frame with the leader. The only essential element is the leader sequence the DhoA promoter and terminator are simply convenient in construction. Alternative bacterial promoters such as, for example, the trp promoter or PL promoter could also be used.Alternative terminators are also available, including, most importantly, the positive retroregulator sequences isolated from B. thuringiensis crystal protein gene, which are also illustrated herein.C. Standard Methods Most of the techniques which are used to transform cells. construct vectors. extract messengerRNA, prepare cDNA libraries, and the like are widely practiced in the art, and most practitioners are familiar with the standard resource materials which describe specific conditions and procedures. However, for convenience, the following paragraphs may serve as a guideline. C.1. Hosts and Control Sequences The invention vectors are suitable for procaryotic expression. Procaryotes most frequently are represented by various strains of E. coli, a gram negative organism. However, other microbial strains may also be used, such as the gram positive bacilli. for example Bacillus subtilis, various species of Pseudomonas. or other bacterial strains. In such procaryotic systems, plasmid vectors which contain replication sites and control sequences derived from a species compatible with the host are used. For example.E. coli is typically transformed using derivatives of pBR322. a plasmid derived from an E. coli species by Bolivar. et al. Gene 1977 2 95. pBR322 contains genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance, and thus provides additional markers which can be either retained or destroyed in constructing the desired vector. Other commonly used vectors are from the pUC series which contain polylinkers for convenient insertion of desiredDNA.Commonly used procaryotic control sequences which include promoters for transcription initiation, optionally with an operator, along with ribosome binding site sequences, are exemplified by such commonly used promoters as the ss lactamase penicillinase promoter system Chang. et al, Nature 1977 198 1056 and the tryptophan trp promoter system Goeddel, et al NucleicAcids Res 1980 8 4057 and the lambda derived promoter and N gene ribosome binding site Shicatake, et al, Nature 1981 292 128 , which has been made useful as a portable control cassette, as set forth in published PCT application number W085 03522 published 15 August, 1985, and assigned to the same assignee. In the instant case, the hoA promoter is illustrated.However, any available promoter system compatible with procaryotes can be used. C.2. Transformations For the procaryotic hosts used to illustrate the invention, the calcium treatment employing calcium chloride, as described by Cohen, 6. N., Proc Natl AcadSci USA 1972 69 2110, or the Abc12 method described in Maniatis, et al, Molecular Cloning ALaboratory Manual 1982 Cold Spring Harbor Press, p.254 was used. C.3. Vector Construction Construction of suitable vectors containing the desired coding and control sequences employs standard ligation and restriction techniques which are well understood in the art. Isolated plasmids. DNA sequences. or synthesized oligonucleotides are cleaved, tailored, and religated in the form desired. Site specific DNA cleavage is performed by treating with the suitable restriction enzyme or enzymes under conditions which are generally understood in the art, and the particulars of which are specified by the manufacturer of these commercially available restriction enzymes. Bee, e.g., New England Biolabs,Product Catalog. In general, about 1 ug of plasmid orDNA sequence is cleaved by one unit of enzyme in about 20 ul of buffer solution in the examples herein, typically, an excess of restriction enzyme is used to insure complete digestion of the DNA substrate.Incubation times of about one hour to two hours at about 370C are workable, although variations can be tolerated. After each incubation, protein is removed by extraction with phenol chloroform, and may be followed by ether extraction. and the nucleic acid recovered from aqueous fractions by precipitation with ethanol followed by running over a Sephadex G 50 spin column. If desired. size separation of the cleaved fragments may be performed by polyacylamide gel or agarose gel electrophoresis using standard techniques. A general description of size separations is found in Methods in Enzymolopy 1980 65 499 560. Restriction cleaved fragments may be blunt ended by treating with the large fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow in the presence of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates dNTPs using incubation times of about 15 to 25 min at 20 to 250C in 50 mM Tris pH 7.6. 50 mM Nail, 6 SK MgC12. 6 mM DTT and 5 10 gM dNTPs. The Klenow fragment fills in at 5 sticky ends but chews back protruding 3 single strands, even though the four dNTPs are present. If desired. selective repair can be performed by supplying only one of the, or selected. dNTPs within the limitations dictated by the nature of the sticky ends.After treatment with Klenow, the mixture is extracted with phenol chloroform and ethanol precipitated followed by running over a Sephadex G 50 spin column. Treatment under appropriate conditions with S1 nuclease results in hydrolysis of any single stranded portion. Synthetic oligonucleotides are prepared by the triester method of Matteucci, et al J Am Chem Soc 1981 103 3185 or using commercially available automated oligonucleotide synthesizers. Kinasing of single strands prior to annealing or for labeling is achieved using an excess. e.g., approximately 10 units of polynucleotide kinase to 0.1 nmole substrate in the presence of 50 mM Tris, pH t.6, 10 mM MgCl2. 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 2 mM ATP, 1.7 pmoles y32P ATP 2.9 mCi mmole . 0.1 SM spermidine, 0.1 mM EDTA. Ligations are performed in 15 30 ul volumes under the following standard conditions and temperatures 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgC12. 10 mM DTT, 33 Bg ml BSA, 10 mM 50 mM Nail, and either 40 WM ATP, 0.01 0.02 Weiss units T4 DNA ligase at 00C for sticky end ligation or 1 mM ATP, 0.3 0.6 Weiss units T4 DNA ligase at 140C for blunt end ligation .Intermolecular sticky end ligations are usually performed at 33 100 pg ml total DNA concentrations 5 100 nM total end concentration . Intermolecular blunt end ligations usually employing a 10 30 fold molar excess of linkers are performed at 1 uNtotal ends concentration. In vector construction employing vector fragments , the vector fragment is commonly treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase BAP in order to remove the 5 phosphate and prevent religation of the vector.BAP digestions are conducted at pH 8 in approximately 150 mM Tris, in the presence of Na and Mg using about 1 unit of BAP per g of vector at 600C for about one hour. In order to recover the nucleic acid fragments. the preparation is extracted with phenol chloroform and ethanol precipitated and desalted by application to a Sephadex G 50 spin column.Alternatively, religation can be prevented in vectors which have been double digested by additional restriction enzyme digestion of the unwanted fragments. C.4. Probe Hybridization Probe hybridization is conducted by lysing colonies containing the DNA to be screened and fixing the DNA to nitrocellulose filters by sequential treatment for 5 min with 500 mM NaOH. 1.5 M NaCl, and washing twice for 5 min each time with 5 x standard saline citrate SSC . Filters are air dried and baked at 600C for 2 hr.The duplicate filters are prehybridized at 420C for 6 8 hr with 10 ml per filter of DNA hybridization buffer 5 x SSC, pH 7.0 5xDenhardt s solution polyvinylpyrrolidine. plus Ficoll and bovine serum albumin 1 x 0.02 of each , 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, 0.2 SDS. 20 gel poly U. and 50 Bg ml denatured salmon sperm DNA . The samples are hybridized with kinased probe under conditions which depend on the stringency desired. Typical moderately stringent conditions employ a temperature of 420C for 24 36 hr with 1 5 ml filter ofDNA hybridization buffer containing probe. For higher stringencies high temperatures and shorter times are employed. The filters are washed four times for 30 min each time at 37 C with 2 x SSC. 0.2t SDS and 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7. then are washed twice with 2 x SSC and 0.2 SDS. air dried. and are autoradiographed at 700C for 2 to 3 days. C.5. Site SPecific Mutaaenesis For portions of vectors derived from cDNA or genomic DNA which require sequence modifications, site specific primer directed mutagenesis is used. This is conducted using a primer synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to a single stranded phage DNA to be mutagenized except for limited mismatching. representing the desired mutation. Briefly, the synthetic oligonucleotide is used as a primer to direct synthesis of a strand complementary to the phage, and the resulting double stranded DNA is transformed into a phage supporting host bacterium. Cultures of the transformed bacteria are plated in top agar. permitting plaque formation from single cells which harbor the phage. Theoretically. 50 of the new plaques will contain the phage having, as a single strand, the mutated form 50 will have the original sequence. The resulting plaques are hybridized with kinased synthetic primer at a temperature which permits hybridization of an exact match, but at which the mismatches with the original strand are sufficient to prevent hybridization. Plaques which hybridize with the probe are then picked, cultured, and the DNA recovered. In more detail, the DNA fragment containing the sequence to be altered is ligated into an appropriate site of the cloning bacteriophage M13. The ligated phage transduced into competent lysogenic E. coli, such as Dug98, and cultured by plating on suitable media.Mini cultures are screened for recombinant single strand phage DNA containing appropriate inserts and the structure of the desired recombinant phage is confirmed using restriction analysis. Ten picomoles of the primer oligonucleotide are hybridized to 2.6 ug of ss clone DNA in 15 ul of a mixture containing 100 mM Nail, 20 mM Tris HCl. pH 7.9, 20 mM Mac12 and 20 mM ss mercaptoethanol, by heating at 670C for 5 min and 420C for 25 min. The annealed mixtures are chilled on ice and then adjusted to a final volume of 25 1 of a reaction mixture containing 0.5 mM of each dNTP, 17 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.9. 17 mM MgCl2, 83 mM NaCl, 17 mM 8 mercaptoethanol, 5 units of DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment. incubated at 370C for 1 hr.The reactions are terminated by heating to 80 C and the reaction mixtures used to transform competent E. coli cells. plated onto agar plates and incubated overnight to obtain phage plaques. Plates containing mutagenized plaques as well as control plates containing unmutagenized phage plaques. are chilled to 4 C and phage plaques from each plate are transferred onto 2 nitrocellulose filter circles by layering a dry filter on the agar plate for 5 min for the first filter and 15 min for the second filter. The filters are then placed on thick filter papers soaked in 0.2 N SOH, 1.5 M NaCl and 0.2 TritonX 100 for 5 min, and neutralized by layering onto filter papers soaked with 0.5 M Tris HCl. pH 7.5. and 1.5 MNaCl for another 5 min. The filters are washed in a similar fashion twice on filters soaked in 2 x ssC. dried and then baked in a vacuum oven at 800C for 2 hr.The duplicate filters are prehybridized at 420C for 4 hr with 10 ml per filter of DNA hybridization buffer 5 xSSC. pH 7.0, 4 x Denhardt s solution polyvinylpyrrolidine. ficoll and bovin serum albumin, ix a 0.02 of each . O.1S SUDS, 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer. pH 7.0 and 100 Bg ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA. P labeled probes are prepared by kinasing the primer with labeled ATP. The filters are hybridized to 5 x 106 cpm ml of 32P labeled primer in 1 5 ml per filter of DNA hybridization buffer at 640C for 8 hr. The filters are washed once at room temperature for 10 min in O.1S SDs, 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer and 6 x SSC once at 370C for 20 min in buffer and 2 xSSC once at 50 C for 20 min in buffer and 2 x SSC and finally at 600C for 20 min in buffer and 1 x SSC. The filters are air dried and autoradiographed at 700C for 4 hr. The desired mutagenized colonies are picked and inocculated into a competent E. coli culture to obtain quantities of the modified DNA. From these cultures, ssDNA is prepared from the supernatant and dsRF DNA is prepared from the pellet. C.6. Verification of Construction Correct ligations for plasmid construction are confirmed by first transforming a suitable E. coli such as strain MM294 obtained from E. coli Genetic StockCenter, CGSC 6135, or other suitable host with the ligation mixture. Successful transformants are selected by ampicillin, tetracycline or other antibiotic resistance or using other markers depending on the mode of plasmid construction, as is understood in the art.Plasmids from the transformants are then prepared according to the method of Clewell, D. B., et al, Proc Uatl Acad Sci USA 1969 62 1159, optionally following chloramphenicol amplification Clewell, D. B., J 3acteriol 1972 110 667 . The isolated DNA is analyzed by restriction and or sequenced by the dideoxy method of ranger. F., et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1977 74 5463 as further described by Messing, et al, Nucleic acids Res 1981 9 309. or by the method of Maxim, et al, Methods in Enzvmolopy 1980 65 499.C.6. Hosts ExemPlified Host strains used in cloning and expression herein are as follows For cloning and sequencing, and for expression of construction under control of most bacterial promoters, E. coli strain MM294 supra , Talmadge. K., et al, Gene 1980 12 235 Meselson, M., et al, Nature 1968 217 1110, was used as the host. For expression under control of the PLNRBS promoter. E. coli strainK12 MC1000 lambda lysogen. N7N53cI857SusP80, ATCC 39531 hereinafter sometimes referred to as MCl000 3953L is used. For M13 phage recombinants. E. coli strains susceptible to phage infection, such as E. coli K12 strain DG98 are employed. The DG98 strain has been deposited with ATCC and has accession number 39768. For constructions employing inserts into pUC vectors, E. coli DG99 was used. This strain is analogous to E. coli JM103 or JM105, and contains a lacZVml5 lesion to complement the pUC plasmid. which contains a functional lacZ gene. Thus. desired cultures containing inserts in the pUC vectors grown on Gal media will produce white colonies. while blue colonies result in cultures transformed with unaltered pUC vectors.D. ExamPles The following examples are intended to illustrate the invention. Constructions of typical expression vectors for both susceptible and non susceptible peptide precursor proteins are illustrated, along with results of transformation with these vectors. D.1. Construction of Source Vectors for phoA Gene ComPonents Host ExPression Vectors pSYCl0l5 pSYC997 pSYC1015 is an approximately 6.3 kb vector containing the entire thoA gene. pSYC997 contains the phoA gene with a modification to provide a NarI site at the C terminal end of the leader sequence. The construction of these plasmids. which were used in further vector construction is shown in Figure 2. Plasmid pEG247 a 25 kb plasmid containing the 2.6 kb PhoA structural gene as a HindIII XhoI fragment was used as a source of the gene. This plasmid was obtained from M. Casadaban and was constructed in a manner analogous to that set forth in Groisman. E. A., et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1984 Q1 1840 1843. Indeed. by applying the procedures set forth in the foregoing reference. the phoA gene may be conveniently cloned into any desirable backbone vector. The HindIII XhoI 2.6 kb fragment from pEG247 was purified and cloned into pUC18, a 2.7 kb plasmid containing an ampicillin resistance marker and a polylinker permitting convenient insertion of desired sequences. pUC18 was digested with HindIII SalI, and the linear vector ligated with the isolated PhoA fragment. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. B coli DG99 to Amp . and the construction of the intermediate plasmid pSYC991 in successful transformants screened for inserts by detection of white colonies on X Gal medium was verified. pSYC991 was used both for the construction of pSYC1015 and of pSYC997. For construction of pSYC1O1S, pSYC991 was digested with HindIII BamHI and the approximately 2.6 kb fragment again purified and ligated with the purified 3.65 kb vector fragment from HindIII BamHI digested pACYClB4. pACYClS4 is available from ATCC and contains the chloramphenicol resistance gene CmR , a bacterial replicon, and HindlII and BamHI sites in the tetracycline resistance gene. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli MM294 to CmR and the construction of pSYC1015 verified by restriction analysis and sequencing. pSYC997 was prepared from pSYC991 by site directed mutagenesis. The PvuII PvuII 770 base pair fragment was obtained from pSYC991. It includes a portion of the DhoA promoter and the upstream N terminal sequences of the mature alkaline phosphatase. and thus.also. the entire leader sequence. This fragment was ligated into the Smal site of M13mpll and single stranded phage was prepared as template for the mutagenesis. In the mutagenesis, the synthetic 26 mer, 5 TTCTGGTGTCGGCGCCTTTGTCACAG 3 was used as primer and probe. The mutagenized phage particles were then used to prepare RF DNA as a source for the desired leader sequence containing the NarI site. PSYC1089 pSYC1089 contains the modified phoA leader, the phoA coding sequences, and the positive retroregulator of the B. thucinqiensis crystal protein gene. Two additional intermediate plasmids, pSYC1052 and pSYC1078, were constructed. as shown in Figure 2, in order to provide a suitable host vector for the B. thurinqiensis positive retroregulator. pSYC1052 was constructed by ligating the purified small HindI I I Bs sHI I fragment containing the phoA promoter and NarI site from modified leader pSYC997 into HindIII BssHII digested pSYC1015, which has, thus, the unmodified phoA sequences deleted. The resulting vector pSYC1052 was confirmed in E. coli transformants to Cm pSYC1078 is a modified form of pSYC1052 with the BamHI site in front of the phoA promoter deleted. In order to delete this BamHI site, pSYC1052 was subjected to partial BamHI digestion, filled in usingDNA polymerase I Klenow in the presence of the four dNTPs, and religated under blunt end conditions. The desired resulting plasmid. now containing a unique BamHI site just 3 of the DhoA gene, was confirmed after screening successful CmB transformants. The ability of the 3 sequences of the gene encoding crystal protein from B. thurinaiensis the crv gene to enhance the expression of upstream coding sequences was described and claimed in copending U.S.Patent Application 646,584, filed 31 August 1984, assigned to the same assignee, and incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, these sequences are characterized by a DNA sequence which transcribes to a corresponding RNA transcript capable of forming a stem and loop structure having a cytosine guanine residue content of about 43 . When ligated about 30 300 nucleotides from the 3 end of the gene, a positive retroregulatory effect is shown on the gene expression.The positive retroregulator was prepared as a 400 bpEcoRI BamHI restriction fragment, which was blunt ended and ligated into pLWl. an expression vector for interleukin 2 to obtain pHCW701, which was used as a source for the desired fragment. pHCW701 was deposited with ATCC under the terms of the Budapest Treaty and has accession no. 39757. To complete pSYC1089, pHCW701 was digested withEcoRI, filled in using Klenow and the four dNTPs, then digested with BamHI. and the 400 bp fragment containing the positive retroregulator recovered. pSYC1078 was digested with AvaI, filled in with Klenow and the four dNTPs. and then digested with BamHI. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli MM294 and the construction of the desired plasmid pSYC1089, a 5.5 kb plasmid conferring CmR. was confirmed. pSYC1089 contains the sequences for the phoA promoter and leader with Narl site sequence and structural gene immediately upstream of a BamHI site, followed by the positive retroregulator sequences of the cry gene. D.2. Construction of Expression Vectors for Phok IL 2 Fusions Four expression vectors containing the desired fusion were constructed pSYC1005 and pSYC1007 which contain no Phok terminator sequences and pSYC1036 and pSYC1038 which do contain phoA terminators . The construction of these vectors is outlined in Figure 3. pSYC1005 and pSYC1007 differ only in the junction region between IL 2 and the leader sequence pSYC1007 contains an additional alanine residue at theN terminus. The IL 2 coding sequences are obtained, in both of these vectors, from pSYC999, which contains the IL 2 coding sequence under trp promoter control. pSYC999 was prepared from another IL 2 containing plasmid, pLW34, by deleting a BanII PvulI fragment. pLWa4. in turn, was prepared from pLWl, which contains the IL 2 sequence and which was described in U.S. Patent Application SerialNo. 646,584 supra , and deposited with ATCC. accession no. 39405. The conversion of pLWl to pLW34 is described in an addendum as SD.6 below. pSYC1005 was constructed by ligating the purified 180 bp HindIII NarI fragment from pSYC997 which fragment contains the portion of the leader sequence between the new NarI site upstream to the PvuII restriction site, preceded by a short segment of phageDNA into the large vector fragment purified from HindlIl NarI digested pSYC999. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli to AmpR, and the construction of pSYC1005 confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing. The sequence in the junction region is a straightforward product of NarI sticky end ligation regenerating the alanine codon in position 1 of the IL 2 sequence. For pSYC1007, pSYC997 was digested with Snarl, filled in using DNA polymerase I Klenow and then withHindIII. Two fragments from pSYC999 were then used the large HindIII XbaI fragment containing most of the vector up through a portion of the coding sequence of IL 2. and the short fragment spanning the NarI XbaI portion of the IL 2 coding sequence obtained by cleaving with BanI, filling in with DNA polymerase I. and then with XbaI. The three way ligation between the pSYC999 vector and the short fragments containing filled NarI sites results in the fusion sequence 5 AAGGCGGCGCCT 3 encoding Lys Ala Ala Pro i.e., it includes an additional alanine residue at the N terminus of theIL 2.The correct construction of this vector, pSYC1007, was also confirmed. pSYC1005 and pSYC1007 were transformed into E.coli MM294, and the transformants were grown under conditions similar to those described by Inouye, H.. et al, J Bact 1981 146 668 675. Briefly, the cells were grown in 10 mM KH2P04 MOPS medium for 6 8 hr and then induced by washing the cells and resuspending inMOPS medium containing 0.1 mM KH2PO4 for 16 24 hr, as described by Neihardt, F.C., et al. J Bact 9174 119 736 747. Osmotic shockates of the culture, prepared as described by Nossal, N.G.. et al, J Biol Chem 1966 241 3055 3062, presumably released the material contained in the periplamic space, but not intracellular material. The osmotic shockates gave no activity.Sonicates, however, which release total cellular content, showed IL 2 activity of 2.1 x 10 4 units ml for pSYC1005 transformants. and 5.5 x 103 units ml for pSYC1007 transformants. Thus, the IL 2 activity produced was not secreted into the periplasm. Biological activity of recombinant IL 2 in all cases was measured using the murine IL 2 dependent cell line HT 2 and measuring the incorporation of 3H3 thymidine, according to the procedure of Watson, J., JExp Med 1979 150 1510 and Gillis. S., et al, J Immunol 1978 120 2027 Modifications of the foregoing expression vectors were made to insert phoA terminators operably disposed with respect to the coding sequences. The terminators were obtained from pSYClOlS supra as the large vector HindIlI partial EcoRI blunt ended withKlenow and the four dNTPs digest fragment. As shown inFigure 3, this fragment carries the CmR gene, the replicon, and the downstream portion of the DhoA gene.The DNA6 containing phoA promoter and leader sequence, with the leader sequence in frame with the IL 2 encoding sequence were obtained from either pSYC1005 or pSYC1007, then purified, and ligated into the above prepared vector fragment of pSYC1015 to obtain pSYC1036 and pSYClOaB respectively. The respective ligation mixtures were transformed into E. coli to CmR and correct constructions confirmed. Transformants from each of pSYC1036 and pSYClO3B, grown and induced as described above, produced IL Z activity at over 100 times the levels obtained for the parent plasmids without terminators. Again, osmotic shockates were inactive, but sonicates of the cell cultures showed 1.2 x 106 units ml and 2 x 106 units ml of IL 2 activity for pSYC1036 and pSYC1038 extracts respectively. Figure 4 shows the results of SDS PAGE on sonicates from induced and uninduced cultures of the above transformants. Lanes 1 and 2 are, respectively uninduced and induced pSYC1036 transformants, lanes 3 and 4 uninduced and induced pSYC1038 transformants.Both the induced cultures have bands corresponding to molecular weights of unprocessed pre IL 2 which bands are absent in the uninduced cultures. D.3. Construction of Expression Vectors for the Susceptible Peptide hGH An in frame fusion with the coding sequence for hGH. but with the fusion containing a codon for an alanine preceding the native N terminus was constructed in a manner similar to that for IL 2 above. The resulting vector. pSYC1053 contains the in frame fusion under control of the phoA promoter and terminator. SeeFigure 5. The hGH coding sequences are obtained from pSYC709 which plasmid was described in U.S. Serial No.583,472, filed 2 March 1984, assigned to the same assignee and incorporated herein by reference. pSYC709 was deposited with ATCC on 7 February 1984 and has accession number 39602. The coding sequences were obtained as a 576 bp HindIlI Smal digest from pSYC709 and cloned into HindIII SmaI cleaved pUC9 to obtain pSYC9lS as an intermediate, thus obtaining an EcoRI site immediately downstream of the Smal site used to obtain the coding sequence. Accordingly, pSYC918 was digested using HindllI EcoRI to produce a 580 bp fragment. which was purified and cloned into the purified large vector fragment from HindIll partial EcoRI digested pSYC1O1S supra .The resulting plasmid. pSYC1046. was transformed into E. coli to Cm and confirmed to contain the hGH coding sequences in operable linkage to the PhoA terminator sequences. To obtain the desired expression vector, pSYC1053, pSYC1046 was digested with HindIlI. filled in with DNA polymeraseI Klenow and then partially digested with EcoRI to delete the vector sequences upstream of the N terminal HindIII site of hGH to theEcoRI site in the CmR gene. This vector fragment was then ligated with the phoA promoter leader sequences and the deleted portion to the EcoRI site of the CmR gene by first obtaining a NarI digest of pSYC1036, filling in with dCTP in the presence of Klenow and then blunt ending with S1. followed by digestion with EcoRI and isolation of the purified fragment.The two EcoRI blunt fragments were then ligated and transformed into E. coli to Cm and the construction of the desired plasmid pSYC1053 confirmed. The sequence at the junction of the PhoA leader and hGH coding sequences is 5 AAGGCAGCTTTC 3 which encodes Lys Ala Ala Phe. hGH production was assayed in osmotic shockates and sonicates of E. coli My294 transformed with pSYC1053 and control intermediate plasmids. Cells were transformed, grown and induced in the presence of low phosphate as set forth above. Figure 6 shows the results of SDS PAGE on whole cell contents sonicates and osmotic shockates of these cells. As shown inFigure 6, cells transformed with pSYC1053 have a unique band at the expected size for processed hGH in the osmotic shockate fraction. as well as in the sonicate.Thus, hGH is a susceptible protein, capable of secretion into the periplasmic space with deletion of the signal sequence. D.4. Construction of Expression Vectors for the SuscePtible PePtide TNF pAW721 is an expression vector which contains the coding sequence for tumor necrosis factor TNF in reading frame with the phoA leader under control of the phoA promoter and B. thuringiensis crystal protein cry positive retroregulator system. Its construction is shown in Figure 7. pAW721 is constructed using pSYC1089 as the source of control and leader sequences. and a modified M13 pAW721 and pE4 to furnish the TNF encoding sequence. pE4 and the plasmid which provides the relevant insert in M13 pAW721 are both described in detail in Wang, A. etal, Molecular Cloning of the lerrritary DNA for Human Necrosis Factor, 228, 149 154, 4 12 85 and incorporated herein by reference. pE4 was deposited with ATCC 15October 1984 and has accession no. 39894 pE4 is a cDNA clone prepared by the method of Okayama and Berg. MolCell Biol 1983 3 280, which contains the entire TNF gene as a HindIII cassette. The modified M13 pAW721 was used to provide the upstream sequences of the gene. It was constructed from pE4 by ligation of a Pstl P6tl fragment from pE4 into the PstI site of M13mp18. The sequence in the resulting vector was then altered by site specific mutagenesis to produce an HpalI site at the upstream end of the gene, using the 18 mer 5 TGATCTGACCGCCTGGGC 3 as primer.The modified M13 vector was designated M13 pAW721 . The desired expression vector. pAW721, was obtained in a three way ligation from a mixture containing 1 the purified large vector NarI BamHI fragment from pSYC1089, which contains the phoA promoter. phoA leader encoding sequence, CaR. the appropriate replicon, and the cry positive retroregulator 2 the purified HpaII HindIII 584 bp fragment from M13 pAW72l , which contains the upstream coding region of the TNF sequence and 3 the purified 700 bp HindIII BamHI fragment from pE4, which contains the downstream portion of theTNF structural gene. The ligation mixture was used to transform E.coli MM294 to CmR, and the correct construction of pAW721 confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing. pAW721 transformed E. coli MM294 cells were grown, induced and extracted as described above. Figure 8 shows the results obtained for both osmotic shockate and total sonicate. Lane 1 contains molecular weight markers, and shows the location expected for TNF. Lane 3 shows the total sonicate contains TNF along with a multitude of other proteins but at a lower level in comparison to other proteins than is obtained using pAW711 transformants lane 2 . Lanes 4, 5, and 6 represent various concentrations of the osmotic shockate showing the TNF band in the presence of a limited number of impurities. And lanes 7 and 8 represent the proteins remaining in the pellet from the osmotic shockate. TNF is presumably still present. although as a minor constituent. The results in Figure 8 show that TNF is a susceptible protein which is secreted, minus the leader sequence, into the periplasm. TNF can thus utilize the pre sequences of the PhoA gene to effect secretion and proper folding. The activity of the TNF obtained from the pAW721 transformed cells was verified by subjecting the osmotic shockate to the L 929 cytotoxicity assay described in SD.5 below. The extracts contained TNF activity. D.5. Cytotoxic AssaY Procedure The L 929 assay system is an improved convenient in vitro assay which permits rapid measurement of TNF activity. Its degree of correlation with the in vivo tumor necrosis assay of Carswell is, at present. unknown however. as it utilizes murine tumor cells specifically, the correlation is expected to be high. The protein designated lymphotoxin in EPO publication no. 0100641 supra also gives activity in this assay. The assay is similar in concept to that disclosed in U.S. 4,457.916 which used murine L M cells and methylene blue staining. however. the L 929 assay has been shown to correlate for HL 60 derived TNF with human tumor cell line cytotoxicity see SD.l.b . In the L 929 assay system herein. L 929 cells are prepared overnight as monolayers in microtiter plates. The test samples are diluted 2 fold across the plate, W irradiated, and then added onto the prepared cell monolayers. The culture media in the wells are then brought to 1 Vg ml actinomycin D. The plates are allowed to incubate 16 hr at 37CC and the plates are scored visually under the microscope. Each well is given a 25, 50. 75. or 100 mark signifying the extent of cell death in the well. One unit of TNF activity is defined as the reciprocal of the dilution at which 50 killing occurs. In addition, a more sensitive version of this assay was developed that monitors the release of 35S labeled peptides from prelabeled cells. when treated with the test sample and actinomycin D. This version of the assay can be used to quantitate potency, e.g., to evaluate the relative potency of oocyte translated material. Briefly, actively growing L 929 cultures are labeled with S methionine 200 Vci ml for 3 hr in methionine free media supplemented with 2 dialyzed fetal calf serum. The cells are then washed and plated into 96 well plates. incubated overnight, and treated the next day with 2 fold dilutions of test samples and 1 trg ml actinomycin D. The cultures were then incubated at 37 C for 18 hr.One hundred iLl supernatant aliquots from each well were then transferred onto another 96 well plate, acid TCA precipitated, and harvested onto glass fiber filters. The filters were washed with 95 ethanol, dried, and counted. An NP40 detergent control is included in every assay to measure maximum release of radioactivity from the cells. The percent 35S release is then calculated by the ratio of the difference in count between the treated cells and untreated controls divided by the difference betweenNP40 treated cells and untreated controls, i.e., by the ratio sample cell control S release x x 100. NP40 cell controlHigher TNF potency results in higher values of this ratio. D.6. Construction of pLW34 pLW34 is a modified form of pLWl wherein theIL 2 gene is provided a NarI site at the upstream end and the carrier plasmid is converted from tetracycline resistance to ampicillin resistance. These modifications are shown in Figure 9 and as follows pLW1, a TcR plasmid. containing the IL 2 gene in front of the trp promoter was used as a source of theIL 2 coding region for cloning into M13mp9 in order to perform site specific mutagenesis. pLWl was digested with HindlII and PstI and the fragment containing theIL 2 coding region was inserted into HindIII PstI digested M13mp9. The resulting M13 vector was subjected to site specific mutagenesis using the synthetic 18 mer 5 GAAGTAGGCGCCATAAGC 3 , which provides a NarI site and an additional Ala codon at the start of theIL 2 gene, as primer.The resulting mutant vectorM13 LW32 was converted to the replicative form and digested with HindIII and BanlI to provide the 570 bp fragment containing the modified portion of the gene. To provide the vector portion, control sequences. and remaining portion of the IL 2 sequence, pLWl was digested with EcoRI and BanIl and the 680 bp fragment containing the trp promoter and upstream portion of the gene isolated and ligated intoEcoRI BanII partial large vector fragment obtained from pBR322. The resulting plasmid, pLW21 which contains the AmpR gene but unmodified IL 2 was then digested with HindIII and BanlI and ligated to the HindllI BanII fragment obtained from M13 LW32 containing the modified IL 2 gene upstream portions. The resulting vector, pLW34 contains a unique NarI site at the start of the IL 2 gene which encodes the starting sequenceMet Ala Pro.
