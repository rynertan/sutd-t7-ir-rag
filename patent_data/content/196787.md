## Description
AFFINITY COLUMN AND PROCESS FOR DETECTION OF LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT TOXIC SUBSTANCES The invention is concerned with non invasive immunological screening procedures for assessing the exposure of humans and animals to environmentally occurring toxins and is particularly directed to immunological compositions and processes for the detection of mutagens and carcinogens frequently encountered in many areas of the world. The incidence and effect of exposure to toxic substances by humans and other animals via food, water, and air is of critical importance to our survival.Within the general class of toxic substances, the detection of small molecular weight 1,000 daltons or less mutagens and or carcinogens such as aflatoxins, fluoranthene, nitropyrene, nitrofluoranthene, nitrochrysens, and aminobiphenyls have become especially important. In particular, non invasive screening procedures for assessing the exposure of humans to substances such as aflatoxins require the ability to quantify both the toxin and its metabolites, especially covalent adducts formed with DNA and proteins, in body fluids such as serum and urine. Aflatoxins are a typical example of the toxic and carcinogenic compounds within this class. Aflatoxins are secondary fungal metabolites, mycotoxins, which are produced by AsPerqillus flavus and Asperaillus parasiticus and are structurally a group of substituted coumarins containing a fused dihydrofurofuran moiety. Aflatoxins occur naturally in peanuts, peanut meal, cottonseed meal, corn, dried chili peppers and the like however the growth of the mold itself does not predict the presence or levels of the toxin because the yield of aflatoxin depends on growth conditions as well as the genetic requirements of the species. A variety of aflatoxins types B1, B2, G1, 2 M1 and M2 have been isolated and characterized. Aflatoxin B1 hereinafter AFB1 is the most biologically potent of these compounds and has been shown to be toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic in many animal species.This mycotoxin is a frequent contaminant of the human food supply in many areas of the world and is statistically associated with increased incidence of human liver cancer in Asia and Africa in particular Busby et al., in Food Born Infections and Intoxications Riemann andBryan, Editors Second Edition, Academic Press, Inc., 1979, pp. 519 610 wotan, G.N. Methods Cancer Res.7 309 344 1973 . AFB1 also forms covalently linked adducts with guanine in DNA after oxidative metabolism to a highly reactive 2,3 exo epoxide, the major adduct product 7 being 2,3 dihydro 2 N guanyl 3 hydroxy aflatoxin B1 hereinafter identified as 7AFB1 N Gua lin et al., Cancer Res. 37 4430 4438 1977 Essigman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74 1870 1874 1977 Martin et al., Nature London 7 267 863 865 1977 .The AFB1 N Gua adduct and its 5 putative derivatives 2,3 dihydro 2 N5 formyl 2 , 5 5 , 6 triamino 4 oxo N pyrimidyl 3 hydroxy aflatoxin B1 hereinafter AF N7 Gua have been identified in a wide variety of tissues and systems such as rat liver in vivo, cultured human bronchus and colon, and human lung cells in culture after acute or chronic administration Haugen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.USA 78 4124 4127 1981 . Some investigations regarding quantitation of aflatoxin B1 and its metabolites including its DNA adduct have been conducted using immunological techniques and monoclonal antibodies Hertzog et al., Carcinopensis 3 825 828 1982 Groopman et al., CancerRes. 42 3120 3124 1982 Haugen et al., Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. USA 78 4124 4127 1981 . Similar research has been conducted utilizing immunological techniques and reagents for other low molecular weight toxins found in our environment Johnson et al., J. Analyt. Toxicol.4 86 90 1980 Sizaret et al., J.N.C.I. 69 1375 1381 1982 Hu et al., J. Food Prot. 47 126 127 1984 andChu, J. Food Prot. 47 562 569 1984 . Nevertheless, insofar as is presently known, the development of a general non invasive screening procedure for assessing the exposure of humans and animals to such environmentally occurring carcinogens has not been achieved. The present invention comprises two distinct parts, each of which represents a major advance and contribution to the invention as a whole. One part of the invention is an affinitv matrix material for the detection of a toxic substance such as aflatoxin B1 in a test sample comprising a solid phase sorbent material and high affinity IgM antibody specific for the toxic substance, the IgM antibody being bound to the sorbent material. This aspect of the invention provides a novel and widely useful method for purifying samples for testing of toxins by use of a specific monoclonal antibody bound to a sorbent material. In addition, the invention comprises a method for detecting a low molecular weight substance such as aflatoxin B1 in a fluid sample comprising the steps of preparing an affinity matrix comprised of a homogenous, high affinity IgM antibody specific for the toxic substance of interest, the antibody being immobilized onto a solid phase sorbent material combining the sample with the affinity matrix such that the substance in the sample is retained by the IgM antibodies adding a releasing agent to the affinity matrix and detecting the presence of the toxic substance in the effluent. The present invention may be more fully and easily understood when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing, in which Fig. 1 is a graph illustrating a competitive radioimmunoassay using 3H AFB1 tracer and a variety of aflatoxins to measure the specificity of IgM antibody Fig. 2 is a graph illustrating a competitive 3 radioimmunoassay using AFB1 tracer in combination with aflatoxin B1 and the major metabolic aflatoxin DNA adducts using the IgM antibody Fig. 3 is a schematic flow outline for the detection and isolation of toxins in general. The present invention is useful for the detection and isolation of toxic substances generally when they present two critical characteristics first, the toxic substance has a molecular weight not greater than about 1000 daltons second, that the toxic substance, either alone or in combination with other compounds, is able to induce an immunological response in vivo when introduced into an animal subject. The first requirement, a molecular weight not greater than about 1000 daltons, is easily determinable for any toxic substance. The term toxic substance as used herein includes all compounds which have been shown to be harmful, hazardous, or destructive, either by in vitro tests or in vivo determinations including epidemological studies . Most notable are those compounds shown to be mutagenic, genotoxic, and or carcinogenic as these terms are used and recognized in this art. The second characteristics, the ability of the toxic substance to induce an immunological response after introduction into a test animal in vivo, relies on its ability primarily but not exclusively to induce antibody formation. It is recognized that often the production of antibodies either precedes or is subsequent to other immunological responses and that the ability to induce antibody production is dependent upon methods for the preparation and introduction of the antigen or hapten which directly affect the quantitative and qualitative antibody response. For this reason, so long as some type of immunological response is observed, it is understood and accepted that production of specific antibodies can be achieved using the techniques and manipulations presently known in this art. The invention therefore applies generally to all toxic substances which meet the two requisite criteria.Specifically included within this class of compounds are aflatoxins regardless of designation and also those polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons exemplified by fluoranthene, nitropyrene, nitrosopyrene, nitrofluoranthene, nitrochrysene, and aminobiphenyls and their derivatives . This general category of aromatic hydrocarbons and each of the specific examples identified are recognized immunogens and are mutagenic carcinogenic in nature. The invention is particularly useful for studies of aflatoxin B, and aflatoxin M1. An entire listing of toxic substances which are also immunogens is extensive, varied in chemical composition and structure, and expanding in view of the ever increasing list compiled by the U.S.Dept. of Health and Human Services. In view of this, a true and complete listing is neither possible nor desirable and will not be attempted here. Instead a representative example, aflatoxin B1, will be the toxic substance of choice which is described for use and detection by the present invention. It is expressly understood, however, that the present invention is not limited to this working example nor to those other toxic substances specifically identified above but rather is suitable instead generally for the entire class of toxic substances which meet the two essential requirements. In view of aflatoxin being the descriptive example herein for all toxic substances of interest as a class and to promote clarity and a complete understanding of the invention in all its component parts, the detailed description will 11 describe each part of the invention independently in separate sections. It will be recognized also that substantial portions of the detailed description relating to the preparation of hybridomas and the production of high affinity IgM antibodies are identical to and shared in common with culture deposit ATCC No. HB8719 described more fully below.I. Preparation of Aflatoxin Immunogen The preferred immunogen is a composition in which aflatoxin B1 has been conjugated to bovine gamma globulin hereinafter BGG . Initially, BGG commercial grade was dissolved in phosphate buffered saline hereinafter PBS , pH 7.0 at a concentration of 10 milligrams per milliliter hereinafter mg ml . The aflatoxin B1 hereinafter AFB was conjugated toBGG using a modification of the procedure employingM chloroperoxybenzoic acid Martin et al., Nature London 267 863 865 1977 . Typically one milligram hereinafter mg of AFB1 3.2 umoles was dissolved in 2.0 ml of methylene chloride and added to a 5 molar excess of M chloroperoxybenzoic acid mCPBA which had been previously dissolved in 2.0 ml of methylene chloride.The BGG in PBS buffer solution was added to this reaction mixture to produce a 5 molar excess of aflatoxin relative to the protein content. The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred overnight at ambient temperature and the reaction terminated subsequently by centrifugation at 2,000 times gravity for 20 minutes.The aqueous epiphase supernatant containing the modified BGG protein was then extensively dialyzed against PBS at pH 7.4. The level of modification of the globulin protein was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 362 nanometers, using a molar extinction coefficient of 18,000. The reaction product of such a preparation AFB1 BGG, demonstrated an average of 40 50AFB1 residues to be bound per molecule per BGG. It should be noted that AFB1 may be conjugated to other carriers to form the immunogen using the procedure described above. For example, the preparation of AFB1 coupled to bovine serum albumin hereinafter BSA is a useful alternative the average level of binding theAFB1 to bovine serum albumin, however, is usually only 20 30 molecules of aflatoxin per molecule of BSA. Other useful carriers may be combined with AFB1 to form a conjugate using reaction methodologies presently known in the art. Exemplifying such conjugates are the following AFB1 BGG mCPBA single strand AFB1 DNA meBSA AFB1 N Gua BGG PABA para amino benzoic acid AFB1 carboxymethyloxime KLH KeholeLimpet Hemocyanin and AFB1 poly Gua BGG.II. IEumunization of Mice Female BALB By CJ Jackson Labs , approximately 16 weeks of age, were immunized with AFB1 BGG immunogen which had been dissolved in PBS and emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund s adjuvant. Using two groups of five mice each, immunization was performed by intraperitoneal injection of 37.5 ug of AFB1 BGG with adjuvant or 12 ug AFB1 BGG with adjuvant in a final volume of 0.2 ml PBS. At 5 weeks and 9 weeks post initial injection, each mouse received an identical quantity of AFB1 BGG emulsified with incompleteFreund s adjuvant. Approximately 10 days after the second injection, serum samples were taken from each mouse via tail bleeding and were assayed for anti aflatoxin antibody activity by ELISA immunoassay determination. For those mice showing the presence of specific antibody in their serum, each was given a final immunozation of the identical AFB1 BGG again in 0.1 ml of PBS injected into the tail vein 3 days prior to sacrifice of the animal. The ELISA immunoassay alo was used to determine the essence of specific antibodies against AFB1 in mouse sera and subsequently to identify specific hybridomas these as says were modifications of methods previously described in the art tHaugen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. USA 78 4124 4127 1981 Groopman et al., CancerRes. 42.3120 3124 1982 1. Briefly summarizing the procedure, AFB1 BSA was dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 2.0 ug ml and 50 ul of this fluid mixture was added to each well of a polyvinyl microtiter plate and allowed to incubate for 2 4 hours at ambient temperature. Other wells in the microtiter plate received 50 ul of BSA in PBS at a concentration of 2 ug ml and served as controls. The fluid in each well was then aspirated and each well washed 3 times with tap water. Subsequently each well received a PBS solution containing either 0.2 BSA or 0.28 gelatin type IV,Sigma and the plates were allowed to incubate for an additional hour at ambient temperature.This procedure was designed to limit non specific bEnding of antibodies. The plates were then washed in tap water and 50 ul aliquots mouse serum samples or hybridoma medium added to each well. To titer the mouse sera, dilutions in PBS containing 10 fetal calf serum were prepared over a range from 1 50 3 50,000 in continuing three fold dilutions. When using hybridoma media, 50 ul aliquots were used with dilution. In either case, the microtiter plates were then incubated for 90 minutes at after 37 after which they were thoroughly washed with tap water.Specific antibodies that became bound to the surface of each well were detected by adding 50 ul of a 1 200 dilution of rat anti mouse kappa antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase to each well followed by incubation for 4 hours at room temperature or incubation overnight at 4 OC . The wells in each plate were then rewashed with tap water. 100 ul per well of 1.0 mg ml p nitrophenyl phosphate solution Sigma prepared in 0.1M diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.8 then was added and allowed to react for 1 2 hours. Quantitative measurement of the p nitrophenol reaction product was performed by measuring the absorbance of the assay well at 405 nanometers using a microtiter plate reader Dynatech Labs . The isotypes of the monoclonal antibodies that is the determination and identification of different antibody heavy chain class were determined in a non competitive ELISA methodology using a commercially purchased kit for mouse immunoglobulin subtype identification Boeringer Mannheim Company .III. Preparation of Hybridomas and Isolation of Monoclonal Antibody Producing Cells The female BALB By CJ mice previously immunized withAFB1 BGG in complete Freuld s adjuvant were tested for production of significant anti aflatoxin B1 serum titers using the non competitive ELISA methodology as described above. Those mice showing high titers were sacrificed and hybridomas prepared following the procedures previously described in Marshak Rothstein et al., J. Immun., 122 2491 2497 1979 .The myeloma cell line used for cell fusion were SP2 0 cells which were maintained Dulbecco s Modified Eagles medium hereinafter DME medium supplemented with 20 volume volume fetal calf serum, 580 micrograms per ml hereinafter ug ml11 glutamine, 10 units ml penicillin, 100 ug ml streptomycin, and non essential amino acids Gibco . The mice were sacrificed and spleen cell suspensions prepared using Hanks balance salt solution buffered with 0.01M phosphate, pH 7.2 hereinafter HPBS . The spleen cells from these mice were fused withSP2 0 myeloma cells using a modification of the Gefter et al. procedure Somatic Cell Genet. 3 321 1977 .Unless stated otherwise, all centrifugations were performed at 700 times gravity for 5 minutes at room temperature. Preferably, 5x10 SP2f0 myeloma cells and 5 x 107 immune spleen cells were combined in a round bottom plastic tube, centrifuged, resuspended in 10 ml of serum free DME medium and centrifuged again.The supernatant was carefully discarded and the centrifuge tube tapped sharply to disperse the residual cell pellet. The cells were then exposed to 0.5 ml of a 30 volume volume solution of polyethylene glycol 1000 Baker Chemical Company in serum free DME for 6 minutes. During this 6 minute period, the cell suspension was gently centrifuged 150 x gravity for 3 minutes . 4.0 ml of serum, free DME was then added to the cell pellet and the cells again resuspended by tapping the tube. The contents of the tube were transferred to 100 x 17 mm Petri dishes and cultured inDME medium containing 20 fetal calf serum for 1 day.The cells were then centrifuged again and resuspended in growth medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine hereinafter HAT medium . 0.1 ml aliquots of the cells were then distributed into the wells of flat bottom microtiter dishes, each aliquot containing approximately 105 SP2 0 cells. After one week s incubation, 0.05 ml of growth medium containing only hypoxanthine and thymidine hereinafter HT medium was added to each well. Cultures were screened for specific anti AFBl antibody activity two weeks post fusion using the ELISA immunoassay technique described earlier. Hybridomas secreting IgM antibodies of high affinity specific for AFB1 were grown as ascites tumor cells inBALB C mice which had been previously injected with 0.5 ml pristane Aldrich . The hybridomas growing within the mice produced large quantities of specific IgM antibodies which were harvested and collected as ascites fluid from each mouse before it died. The collected fluid from these animals was pooled and either used directly in the immunoassays or further purified by saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialysis against PBS. Gross pathological examination showed that all mice died as a result of widespread tumor invasion that is growth of the injected hybridoma cells. Some of the monoclonal antibodies obtained by this method were shown to be a high affinity IgM antibodies having specificity for the AFB1 molecule. Values for the affinity constant for this antibody were determined to be 8 x 108 and 1 x 109 liters per mole byScatchard plot analysis and by the method of Muller tJ. Immunol. Meth., 34 345 352 1980 . The values were derived from data obtained following a competitive RIA procedure as follows The assay routinely employed 300 microliter hereinafter us total volume of which 100 ul consisted of H1 aflatoxin B1 tracer specific activity 3.4 Ci mmol purchased from MoravekBiochemicals. The tracer concentrate was diluted in 1 normal mouse serum containing 0.1 BSA in PBS to a level of about 20,200 cpm 100 ul The monoclonal antibody was diluted to a concentration which precipitated 30 50 of the aflatoxin B1 tracer. The antibody was added to the reaction mixture in 100 ul aliquots which contain 10 fetal calf serum in PBS. The test sample, consisting of non radiolabelled aflatoxin B1 or its metabolites including the major aflatoxin B1 DNA adducts AF N7 Gua and AF FAPyr, were added to the tube in 100 ul volumes. The reaction mixture was incubated at ambient temperature for two hours after which the mixture was brought to a 1.0 mi volume with PBS. An equal volume of ice cold saturated ammonium sulfate solution was then added after which the sample was mixed and allowed to stand on ice for 15 minutes. The sample was then centrifuged for 15 minutes at 2000 x gravity and the percent of inhibition in the reaction determined using the Muller methodology. The specificity of the IgM antibody for AFB1 and its metabolites are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. It should be noted that these results were obtained using purified IgM antibody of high affinity which was initially fractionated by precipitation with saturated ammonium sulfate followed by dialysis against PBS. The antibody was then purified by high pressure liquid chromatography in a steric exclusion which took advantage of the high molecular weight 900,000 daltons of the IgM antibody for its separation and isolation. It is the characteristics and properties of this purified IgM antibody whose specificity and high affinity constants were then utilized as described herein.Using the competitive RIA methodology, the 50 inhibition levels for aflatoxin B1, aflatoxin B2 and aflatoxin M1 were found to be 3.0 picomoles whereas those for aflatoxin G1, aflatoxin G2 and aflatoxin Q1 were 60.0, 84.0, and 275.0 picomoles respectively. The data shown in Fig. 2 identified the specificity and 50 inhibition point for the IgM antibody for aflatoxin B1 and the two major aflatoxin DNA adducts, AF FAPyr andAF N7 Gua. The 50 inhibition values were 3.0, 24.0, and 89.0 pmoles respectively. The data therefore indicates that this IgM antibody is approximately four times more sensitive in detectng the AF FAPyr adduct than the AF N7 Gua adduct. A deposit of these monoclonal antibody producing hybridoma cells was made at the American Type CultureCollection on 2nd February 1985 the deposit has been allocated culture deposit ATCC No. HB 8719.IV. Affinity Matrix Comprising Immobilized Anti AFB. IsM Monoclonal Antibody An affinity matrix material was prepared using this purified IgM monoclonal antibody following the procedures described by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals. Sufficient 2.0 mg monoclonal antibody was dissolved in coupling buffer comprising 0,1M NaHC03, pH 8.3 and 0.5M NaCl to form a 1.0 mg ml solution. This antibody solution was added to 2.5 g of cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose 4B Sigma which had been incubated previously in 8.0 ml of 0.001M HC1 overnight.After the Sepharose and antibody solution were allowed to react for 1 hour, the unbound sites of the antibody bound gel were blocked by incubating the solid phase sorbant material with 1.OM ethanolamine, pH 8.5 for 1 hour. The combination of the IgM antibody immobilized onto the solid phase sorbant material formed an affinity matrix which then was used in volumes of from 1 2 ml. Although the preferred solid phase sorbant material is the activated Sepharose 4B gel, it is recognized that many other materials may be substituted as the solid phase material. These include other agarose gel composition, dextrans, carbon and silicon granular preparation and the like, including glass plates.Similarly, methods for immobilizing the high affinityIgM antibody onto each of these different chemical compositions are known and described in the art. For this reason, the preparation of a solid phase sorbant material which is then coupled to the high affinity IgM antibody as described herein in any form, concentration, or configuration is deemed to be within the scope of the present invention. V. Methodolocrv For Detectina And Isolating Aflatoxins In A Fluid SamPle The methodology for detecting aflatoxins and aflatoxin DNA adducts in a test sample is an affinity chromatography technique comprising the following steps Preparing an affinity matrix comprising a homogenous, high affinity IgM antibody specific for the aflatoxin or aflatoxin DNA adduct of interest which has been immobilized onto a solid phase sorbent material combining the test sample with the affinity matrix such that those aflatoxins as are present in the test sample become bound to and are retained by the IgM antibodies of the affinity matrix adding a releasing agent to the affinity matrix for the release of the aflatoxin from the IgM antibodies, this releasing agent comprising at least a 50 v v aqueous solution of a compound selected from the group consisting of dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl formamide and dimethyl acetamide and identifying the presence of the aflatoxin in the effluent collected from the affinity matrix. A critical characteristic of the anti aflatoxin IgM monoclonal antibodies is not only its specificity for this AFB antigen but also its high affinity constant 1 0 at least about 1 x 1,8, and preferably at least about 1 x 109, liters per mole which requires the use of unique releasing agent for the detachment of the aflatoxin of interest after it has become bound to the covalently linked antibody in the affinity column. This is demonstrated by the following examples which identify not only the ability of the antibody bound sorbant material to bind the aflatoxin of interest but also to indicate the inability of releasing agents and eluants known in the art to selectively detach and release the aflatoxin after it has become bound within the affinity column. Examnle 1. Initial experiments were performed to determine the ability of anti AFB1 IgM antibody immobilized uponSepharose 4B as an affinity material to bind aflatoxinB1. In these studies radio labelled 3H aflatoxin B1 was used at a concent ation of 1 nanogram in 10 mlPBS aliquots, a level which would approximate the concentration of aflatoxins expected to be found in the body fluids of humans exposed to contaminated foods. 3Initially 100 ul of H AFB1 tracer in 10.0 ml containing 0. lio BSA, 10 mM NaN3, 0.1 ml normal mouse 3 sera and 3 ul of H AFB1 was added to about a 1.0 ml gel bed. The eluant column flow rate was slightly greater than 0.25 ml per minute. About 200 ul of PBS was added to the tracer and transferred to the column by allowing it to run down the column until the top of the affinity matrix was exposed to the air without allowing the column to dry out . An additional 2.0 ml of PBS was added to wash the tracer through the column and the effluent was collected in a vial as a single fraction No. 1 . In this way approximately 24,486 CPM of tracer material was added to the column and, as each fraction was collected, the effluent analyzed for radio labelled content by scintillation. Different eluants were then added to the affinity matrix to determine their ability to release the AFB1 tracer. The results are given inTable 1 below. Table I CPMEffluent Volume PerFraction Eluant Used Fraction 1 Sample PBS 300 ul 2.0 ml 2,494 2 PBS Wash 2.0 ml 287 3 2M KSCN 3.0 ml 347 4 P04 buffer 2.64M NaCl, pH 3.0 3.0 ml 122 5 DEA buffers 2.64M NaCl, pH 9.9 3.0 ml 36 6 P04 buffer 0.14M Nail, pH 2.0 2.0 ml 38 7 50 DMSO P04 Buffer 0.14 NaCl, pH 2.0 2.0 ml 23,632Total recovery of radioactivity was 100 within experimental error. As is evident, about 10 quantitatively of the original tracer was not adsorbed by the affinity matrix initially and was collected in effluent fraction No. 1 prior to the addition of any of the eluants tested.These findings have been attributed to non specific tritium exchange in the tracer. Subsequent reaction with each eluant listed revealed no substantial release of tracer AFB1 by the IgM antibodies of the matrix in effluent fractions 2 7. It was only after using 50 dimethyl sulfoxide hereinafter DMSO that the bulk 90 of the AFB1 tracer was released from the affinity matrix. It is also noted that when the DMSO was added to the affinity column, a definite color change within the matrix became visible and the column bed itself became more translucent. When PBS was added to the affinity matrix after the DMSO effluent fraction was collected, the gel bed returned to its original opaque state and normal condition. It will be appreciated also that the affinity matrix material returned to its original normal condition without damage to or modification of by denaturation, precipitation, etc. the IgM antibodies conjugated to the Sepharose gel in any way. This is demonstrated by the continuation of this experiment after the DMSO releasing agent had been added followed by a washing with PBS. A second 100 ul qu of it or tracer A second 100 ul H AFB1 dissolved in 200 ul of PBS was then added to the same column which had been previously used to iso late the 3 first sample of H AFB1 tracer. The second tracer aliquot was then followed by a rinse of 2.0 ml PBS and the effluent collected as fraction No. 8. A 2.0 ml aliquot of DMSO in PBS was then added and the effluent collected as fraction No. 9 The column was then washed with two additional 2.0 ml PBS aliquots and the effluents collected as fractions 10 and 11. The results are given in Table II below. Table IIEffluentFraction ofNo. EluanW cm Original 8 PBS 2,658 10 9 508 DMSO 14,462 608 10 1st PBS wash 8,282 30 11 2nd PBS wash 530 0 The second tracer aliquot contained approximately 24,486 cpm as the total radio label load and it will be noted that approximately 10 of the tracer was not retained by the affinity matrix again. Fraction 9 again indicates that the bulk of the AFB1 tracer was released by the DMSO about 60 while the remainder was collected in fraction 10 as the first subsequent PBS washing containing some residual DMSO. In addition, a variation of this experiment was conducted to show the need for using at least a 50 concentration of DMSO before the releasing effect can be obtained. For this experiment, the 100 ul tracer aliquot of 3H AFB1 contained approximately 27,000 28,000 cpm in total. The 100 ul aliquot of tracer was loaded on to the affinity column followed by an initial washing of 200 ul of PBS to remove the non retained tracer from the column. The matrix was then washed with increasing concentrations of DMSO in 1.0 ml aliquots. The results are given in Table III below.

Other releasing agents found suitable for use in this methodology were dimethyl formamide and dimethyl acetamide each of these should be used in a concentration of at least 50 in order to be effective as a releasing agent. The use of these releasing agents, or aprotic solvents in general, permits the affinity matrix or column to be reusable for numerous sample runs. Eluting with such aprotic solvents does not cause deterioration of the matrix material, which may be of importance to industrial applications for the detection and measurement of mycotoxins. Economical use of the process in industrial applications would require a reusable affinity matrix and elution with aprotic solvents, such as DMSO, meets this need. On the other hand, elution can also be performed with lipophilic solvents, such as methanol and ethanol, in which case the affinity matrix or column will be substantially nonreusable. According to this aspect of the invention, elution is conducted with preferably 50 100 methanol or ethanol, particularly 100 , proceeding similar to the procedure described above, except substituting methanol or ethanol for DMSO.VI. In Vitro Isolation of Aflatoxin From Human Urine, Serum and Milk As demonstrated above, the capacity of the IgM antibody affinity matrix to bind AFB1, as determined by radiometric and absorbance technique, was to bind 1.0 1.3 ug of AFB1 from 10 ml of PBS per 1 ml of column bed volume. These parameters may be used to isolate and detect aflatoxins in vitro from human urine, serum and milk samples as follows Human serum 10 ml aliquots or human milk 10 ml aliquots may be applied directly to the antibody matrix without prior treatment of the sample. In both instances, quantitative binding of aflatoxins in the fluid sample to the antibody matrix occurs which are then quantitatively recovered using a 50 concentration of DMSO as the releasing agent.This has been empirically determined using H AFB1 in 1 nanogram concentrations added directly to the serum or milk samples in the manner earlier described. Therefore, when testing either serum or milk test samples, no preparative steps are required for quantitative recovery of the aflatoxin. Urine samples however, require a preparative step involving preparative chromatography to remove interfering materials, e.g. salts, within the sample before isolation and recovery of the aflatoxin can be achieved. This is shown schematically in Fig. 3 in which a Sep Pak C18 cartridge Waters Associates,Inc. is preferably used to remove the interfering materials. If the urine sample is first passed through a preparative, low pressure, liquid chromatography cartridge to remove proteins and other interfering materials, 90 95 of the aflatoxins present in human urine samples are consistently and quantitatively recovered using the present methodology. It should be noted also that the use of high affinity IgM antibody specifically raised against AFB1 is also useful for the detection and recovery of theAFB1 DNA adduct, AFB1 N7 Gua on a quantitative basis. These aflatoxin DNA adduct products can be detected without any preparative step and recovered quantitatively from serum and other bodily fluids. If urine from humans and animals comprise the test sample it is preferred that the preparative step of HPLC through a carbon chromatography cartridge be performed initially before adding the sample to the affinity matrix. In this manner, a quantitative and qualitative method is available to isolate and purify aflatoxin B1 and its metabolites from complex biological samples obtained from environmentally exposed populations.In addition, it also serves as an analytical methodology for the detection of the aflatoxin itself. From the above, it can be seen that the present invention provides a means for easily and accurately detecting levels of a toxin, particularly aflatoxin, in a sample. An important aspect of the invention is the affinity matrix or column to which is bound the specific monoclonal antibody. The use of such an affinity matrix comprised of antibody immobilized onto a solid phase sorbant provides a means for quick, efficient high purification of samples for testing. Because of the high affinity and selectivity characteristics of the monoclonal antibody, a crude ground extract of a sample can be run through the antibody matrix column, whereby the toxin of interest will bind to the antibody while all remaining ingredients of the sample extract will pass through.Subsequent elution with an appropriate releasing agent, such as DMSO or methanol, will result in an eluting of the toxin into a collected sample which will contain highly purified toxin in quantitative yields from the original crude sample. Such an efficient one step purification procedure is an important advance, particularly in the field of assays for toxins. This important aspect of the invention has broad applications to the detection and measurement of other toxins, particularly mycotoxins, by the use of a matrix or column having bound thereto a monoclonal antibody specific for the toxin of interest. Once the toxin has been purified by means of the antibody matrix material, detection of the toxin can be made, as desired, by various qualitative or quantitative assay measurement techniques, such as fluorescence, immunoassay, radioimmunoassay, ELISA method, TLC, HPLC, gas chromatography, colorimetric analysis, and the like.Selection of the particular detection method will depend upon a variety of factors, including type of toxin, expected levels of toxin and the use for the detected data. In either event, the present invention provides a method utilizing an affinity matrix having bound thereto a monoclonal antibody whereby samples for analysis and detection can be prepared simply and quickly by a single pass through the affinity matrix. For aflatoxins, one preferred detection method is fluorescence, whereby the purified sample is subjected to W light 365 rm and the aflatoxin fluoresces at 425 rm. This type of analysis is particularly preferred because of its assay performance and yet its usefulness in even providing some level of quantitative detection.These fluoresence analysis procedures can be conducting following AOAC methodology see AOAC Methods, Ch. 26, pp. 414 429 1980 hereby incorporated by reference . Because the use of the antibody bound matrix permits such improved one step purification of a sample containing toxin, the invention is applicable to a variety of samples which could be tested for levels of toxins, including industrial wastes and foods, such as corn, peanuts and the like, as well as body fluids.

Oualitative Assay Toxin levels according to the invention can first of all be measured qualitatively.
