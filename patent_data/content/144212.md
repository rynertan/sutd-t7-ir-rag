## Abstract
An apparatus for cutting hair 1 includes a tube 2 defining an air flow path with a cutting device 4, 5 located in a cutting zone in the flow path. The cutting device 4,5 includes a rotor 5 and a stator 4 which co operate in a continuous scissors like manner with the rotor 5 being moved by a small air driven turbine 20 . The apparatus 1 is adapted for connection to a vacuum cleaner to provide an air flow in the air flow path and to drive the turbine 20 .
