# Structure and process for fabricating an integrated circuit.

## Abstract
An improved bipolar transistor structure formed in a very small area of a thin epitaxial layer 12 on a planar surface of a silicon substrate 10 of first conductivity type, said very small area of the thin epitaxial layer 12 having vertical isolating sidewalls 22 extending to the planar surtace of said substrate, said area of thin epitaxial layer 12 containing in the order recited a shallow depth emit ter region 43 of a second conductivity type having an exposed planar surface, a shallow depth base region 47 of said first conductivity type, and a shallow depth active collector region of said second conductivity type, an elon gated region 37 of said first conductivity type surround ing said emitter 43 , base 47 and active collector re gions, said elongated region 37 being contained within and coextensive with said vertical isolating sidewalls 22 of said small area of said thin epitaxial layer 12 , whereby the base collector capacitance is materially reduced due to the very small area of the base collector junction.
