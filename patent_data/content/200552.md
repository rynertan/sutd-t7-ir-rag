## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION PHOTOELECTRIC CONVERTING DEVICEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to a photoelectric converting device having a photocharge accumulating region whose potential is controlled through a capacitor.Description of the Prior Art Fig. 1 is a schematic cross sectional view of the photoelectric converting device disclosed in the Official Gazette of EPC Application Laid Open No.0132076. In the diagram, photo sensor cells are formed and arranged on an n type silicon substrate 101. Each photo sensor cell is electrically insulated from the adjacent photo sensor cells by an element isolating region 102 consisting of Sio, or the like. Each of the photo sensor cells has the following constitution. An n region 103 having a low impurity concentration is formed by an epitaxial technique or the like. A p region 104 is formed on the n region 103 by doping p type impurities. An n region 105 is formed in a p region 104 by impurity diffusion technique or ion implantation technique or the like. The p region 104 and n region 105 serve as a base and an emitter of a bipolar transistor, respectively. An oxide film 106 is formed on the n region 103 formed with those respective regions in this way.A capacitor electrode 107 having a predetermined area is formed on the oxide film 106. The capacitor electrode 107 faces the p region 104 so as to sandwich the oxide film 106. A potential of the p region 104 in the floating state is controlled by applying a pulse voltage to the capacitor electrode 107. In addition, an emitter electrode 108 connected to the n region 105 is formed, and an electrode to apply a potential to a collector of the bipolar transistor through an n region having a high impurity concentration and the like are formed on the back surface of the substrate 101, respectively. The fundamental operation of the photoelectric converting device shown in Fig. 1 will then be described. A light enters the p region 104 as the base of the bipolar transistor and the charges corresponding to an amount of incident light are accumulated into the p region 104 accumulating operation . A base potential changes due to the accumulated charges and by reading out the potential change from the emitter electrode 108 in the floating state, an electrical signal corresponding to the incident light amount can be obtained reading operation . On one hand, to remove the charges accumulated in the p region 104, the emitter electrode 108 is grounded and a pulse of a positive voltage is applied to the capacitor electrode 107 refreshing operation .By applying the positive voltage, the p region 104 is forwardly biased with respect to the n region 105 and the accumulated charges are removed. Thereafter, the accumulating, reading, and refreshing operations are repeated. In other words, according to the system proposed in the conventional device, the charges generated due to the incident light are accumulated into the p region 104 as the base and a current flowing between the emitter and collector is controlled by the amount of accumulated charges. Therefore, after the accumulated charges were amplified by the amplifying function of each cell, they are read out, so that high power, high sensitivity, and further low noise can be accomplished. In the above photoelectric converting device, the element isolating region 102 consisting of an insulating material is provided to prevent the extent in the lateral direction of the depletion layer of each photo sensor cell. As a method of forming such an element isolating region 102, there are the method whereby the n layer 103 is etched until a predetermined depth to form a concave portion and this concave portion is filled with an insulating material and the method whereby a selective epitaxial growth SEG method is used. However, according to the former method wh reby the concave portion is formed, a damage or a defect occurs in the n layer 103 due to the etching process. Further, the residual is formed in the groove portion due to the reaction of the etching gas and the photo resist. The electrical characteristic of the element deteriorates due to this pollution or the like, in particular, a leak current and a dark current between the elements increase. According to the method whereby the SEG method is used, an oxide is preliminarily formed due to the thermal oxidation, CVD method, or the like and only the portion of the element isolating region 102 is left due to the etching process. Subsequently, polysilicon, silicon nitride, or the like is formed in the side wall portion by an LPCVD method or the like. The n layer 103 is deposited between the element isolating regions due to the epitaxial growth method. However, there are the problems such that the crystalline property of the portion near the boundary between the n layer 103 as the element region and the element isolating region 102 deteriorates and the leak current increases due to the shape of the element isolating region which is formed by the etching and due to the influence of the thin film formed in the side wall portion. Fig. 2 is a schematic cross sectional view of a photoelectric converting device formed with the element isolating region due to the diffusion of impurities. To form an n element isolating region 111 as shown in Fig. 2, it is sufficient to diffuse the impurities until a predetermined depth, so that the manufacturing becomes easy. However, this method has the problem such that the diffusion of the impurities also progresses in the lateral direction and a width of the element isolating region 111 becomes 1.5 to 2 times or more larger than the depth of diffusion, so that a limitation occurs in the case of fining the elements. Fig. 3 A is a schematic cross sectional view of a photoelectric converting device formed with an element isolating region by use of a selective oxidation method. Fig. 3 B is a potential distribution diagram of the device of Fig. 3 A . In this example, the element isolating region is constituted by an oxide film 109 selectively grown by an LOCOS method and an n region 110 formed just under the oxide film 109. However, the selective oxidation method has the problem such that it is difficult to oxidize until a depth over 1 pm from the surface of the silicon layer, so that the electrical isolation is insufficient.As shown in Fig. 3 B , the equipotential line of 5.0 volts is cut on the sides of the n region 110 and n layer 103 and the depletion layers of the adjacent elements are connected, so that a part of the carriers generated due to the incident light are accumulated into the base regions of the other elements, causing the resolution to deteriorate. Further, the selective oxidation method has the problem called a bird s beak regarding the extent in the lateral direction of the oxide film, which is peculiar to this method, so that it has also the problem such that a width of the element isolating region is widened, resulting in that it is difficult to realize high integration.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a photoelectric converting device which can solve the foregoing conventional problems for higher integration. Another object of the invention is to provide a photoelectric converting device comprising a plurality of photoelectric converting cells which are arranged and each of which has a semiconductor transistor consisting of two main electrode regions formed of a semiconductor of one conductivity type and a control electrode region consisting of a semiconductor of the opposite conductivity type and a capacitor for controlling a potential of the control electrode region in the floating state, wherein each of the photoelectric converting cells executes at least the operations to accumulate carriers generated due to an incident light into the control electrode region and read out an accumulated voltage generated due to the accumulated carriers by controlling the potential of the control electrode region in the floating state through the capacitor, and an isolating region to electrically isolate the adjacent photoelectric converting cells is composed of an insulating region formed on the basis of a concave portion formed due to an etching and a semiconductor region having a high concentration formed under the insulating region, and the high concentration semiconductor region consists of a semiconductor of the same conductivity type as that of the main electrode region of the photoelectric converting cell.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a schematic cross sectional view of a photoelectric converting device disclosed in the Official Gazette of EPC Application Laid Open No.0132076.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS An embodiment of the present invention will now be described in detail hereinbelow with reference to the drawings. Fig. 4 is a cross sectional view of one cell in the first embodiment of a photoelectric converting device according to the embodiment. A constitution of the embodiment is substantially the same as that of the conventional example shown in Figs. 1 to 3 except the element isolating region. Namely, an n epitaxial layer 4 is formed on an n type silicon substrate 1. A p base region 10, an n emitter region 12, a capacitor electrode 11, and the like are formed in the n epitaxial layer 4.Although not shown, a collector electrode is formed on the back surface of the substrate 1. An element isolating region is constituted by an insulating region 8 and an n region 7 formed just under the insulating region 8. In this embodiment, the insulating region 8 is formed by burying an oxide into a concave portion formed due to an etching as will be explained later. A proper voltage is applied to the n region 7 by an element isolating control electrode 14. Figs. 5 A and 5 B are potential distribution diagrams of the embodiment. Fig. 5 A shows the case where a depth of concave portion which is formed due to the etching is about 1 pm. Fig. 5 B shows the case where the depth is about 1.5 pm. A voltage of 5 volts is applied to the n layer 4 and n region 7. The p base region 10 is grounded. Even when the depth of etching is about 1 pm as well as mentioned above, the potentials of the element isolating region and the portion lower thereof are held at 5V. It will be understood that the isolating effect which is substantially equivalent to the cases of the deep element isolating regions as shown in Figs 1 and 2 is obtained. Further, in the case where the depth of etching is about 1.5 um, the junction capacitance between the p base region 10 and the n layer 4 serving as a collector region can be also reduced. The effect of preventing a decrease in output is also derived. The manufacturing process of the embodiment will then be described. Figs. 6 A to 6 K are diagrams for explaining the manufacturing process of the embodiment. First, as shown in Fig. 6 A , an n layer 2 for ohmic contact having an impurity concentration of 1 x 1017 to 1 x 1020 cm 3 is formed on the back surface of the n type silicon substrate 1 having an impurity concentration of 1 x 1015 to 1 x 1017 cm 3 due to a diffusion of P, As, or Sb. Then, an oxide film 3 e.g., SiO2 film having a thickness of 3000 to 7000 is formed on the n layer 2 due to a CVD method. The oxide film 3 is called a back coat and serves to prevent the generation of the impurity vapors when the substrate 1 is subjected to a heat treatment Next, the surface of the substrate 1 is etched for about one and half minutes at a temperature of 1000 C under the condition of HCQ of 2 l min and H2 of 60 Q min. Thereafter, for example, a source gas SiH2CQ2 100 of 1.2 Q min and a doping gas PH3 diluted by H2 20 ppm of 100 me are poured. The n epitaxial layer 4 hereinafter, referred to as an n layer 4 is formed at a growth temperature of 10000c and at a reduced pressure of 120 to 180 Torr. In this case, the growth speed of monocrystal is 0.5 iim min, the thickness is 2 to 10 urn, and the impurity concentra tion is 1x1012 to 1016 cm 3, preferably, 1012 to 1014 cm 3 Fig. 6 B . To improve the quality of the n layer 4, the substrate is first subjected to a heat treatment at high temperatures of 1150 to 1250 C to remove oxygen from the portion near the surface. Then, a number of microdefects are generated in the substrate due to a heat treatment at a temperature of about 8000C for a long period of time, thereby obtaining the substrate having the denuded zone in which the intrinsic gettering can be carried out. This method is extremely effective to improve the quality of the n layer 4. Subsequently, an oxide film 5 for pad having a thickness of 500 to 1500 A is formed on the n layer 4 due to the pyrogeneic oxidation E2 02 , wet oxidation 02 H 20 , steam oxidation N2 H20 , or dry oxidation. Further, to obtain a good oxide film having no stacking fault or the like, it is suitable to perform the oxidation at temperatures of 800 to 1000 C and at a high pressure. Further, a silicon nitride film Si3N4 6 having a thickness of 500 to 2000 A0 is deposited by an LPCVD method or P CVD method Fig. 6 C . The LPCVD method was used in this example.The good nitride film 6 was obtained under the conditions of the deposition temperatures of 750 to 850 OC, the deposition pressure of 0.2 to 0 4 Torr, iR2Cxz of 20 to 50 SCCM, and Nz3 of 70 to 150 SCCM. Next, the nitride film 6 and oxide film 5 of the portions where the element isolating region is formed are removed due to a dry etching method such as plasma etching method, reactive ion etching method, or the like. Subsequently, the n layer 4 is etched and removed until a depth of 0.5 to 1.5 um due to a reactive ion etching using the nitride film 6 as a mask, thereby forming a concave portion. In this case, it is desirable to suppress the etching in the lateral direction by providing an anisotropy by selecting an etching gas. Then, As ions as n type impurities are implated into the bottom portion of the concave portion by way of an ion implantation method by use of the nitride film 6 as a mask similarly Fig. 6 D . In this example, the good result was obtained by performing the etching under the conditions of the etching gas of CR, N2, the vacuum degree of 2 to 3 2Pa, and the RF power of 0.2 to 0.4 W cm2. Next, the As ions implanted in the N2 gas are activated and the concave portion is filled with silicon oxide under an atmosphere of N2 H2O or H2 2 thereby forming the insulating region 8 and n region 7 F g. 6 E . The nitride film 6 and pad oxide film 5 are then removed Fig. 6 F . The surface of the n layer 4 is oxidized to form the oxide film 9 Fig. 6 G . Next, ions of p type impurities are implanted due to an ion implantation method and the p base region 10 of a predetermined depth is formed due to a heat treatment Fig. 6 H . Polysilicon is then deposited onto the oxide film 9 due to a CVD method or the like. The polysilicon electrode 11 serving as a capacitor electrode is formed due to a patterning. Subsequently, the n emitter region 12 is formed due to an ion implantation method or the like Fig. 6 I . In this example, good polysilicon could be deposited under the conditions of the deposition temperatures of 600 to 640 OC, the deposition pressure of 0.2 to 0.4 Torr, and SiH4 of a flow rate of 20 to 100 SCCM. After an insulating film 13 between layers was formed by a CVD method or the like, contact holes are formed on the n region 7, emitter region 12, and polysilicon electrode 11, respectively. All is evaporated and deposited in the contact holes and the element isolating control electrode 14, an emitter electrode 15, and an electrode 16 connected to the polysilicon electrode 11 are formed by a patterning, respectively, Fig. 6 J . Subsequently, a surface protecting film 17 such as SiO2 doped with P, Si3N41 or the like is formed due to a CVD method or P CVD method or the like and the photoelectroc converting device is formed in this manner Fig. 6 K . The step of Fig. 6 D and subsequent steps can be also changed as will be explained hereinafter. Figs. 7 A to 7 D are diagrams for explaining the second manufacturing process of the embodiment. First, after completion of the step of Fig.6 D , the oxidation is performed to form an oxide film 18 having a thickness of 500 to 2000 A in the concave portion Fig. 7 A . Then, a silicon nitride film 19 having a thickness of 500 to 2000 is formed by an LPCVD method or the like Fig. 7 B . The silicon nitride film 19 in the bottom portion of the concave portion is removed due to a reactive ion etching, thereby allowing the nitride film 19 on the side wall surface of the concave portion to be left Fig. 7 C . Subsequently, the concave portion is filled with silicon oxide due to a selective oxidation and the insulating region 8 is formed and at the same time, the n region 7 is formed by diffusing the impurities of As which have already been ion implanted Fig. 7 D . Next, the nitride film 6 and oxide film 5 are removed and thereafter the photoelectric converting device is manufactured by the steps similar to those shown in Figs. 6 F to 6 K . According to the second manufacturing method, the nitride film 19 is left on the side wall surface of the concave portion and the selective oxidation is carried out, so that a lateral extent of the isolating region can be suppressed and the finer element isolating region can be formed. The step of Fig. 6 D and subsequent steps are not limited to the steps by way of a growth of the oxide film from the n layer 4 but a dielectric material or polysilicon may be also buried as will be explained hereinbelow. Figs. 8 A and 8 B are diagrams for explaining the third manufacturing process of the embodiment. After completion of the step shown in Fig.6 D , the nitride film 6 and oxide film 5 are removed.Then the oxidation is performed to form an oxide film 20 having a thickness of 200 to 2000 and the implantedAs ions are diffused to form the n region 7 Fig.8 A . Next, polysilicon or dielectric material 21 is filled in the concave portion surrounded by the oxide film 20 due to an LPCVD method, CVD method, spin on glass method, bias sputtering method, or the like. In the case of forming the polysilicon layer 21 due to an LPCVD method, the conditions are such that, for instance, the temperature is 580 to 650 OC, the vacuum degree is 20 to 100 Pa, and the flow rate of Si is 20 to 100 SCCM. In the case of forming the silicon nitride film by the same method, the conditions are such that, for example, the temperature is 750 to 850 OC, the vacuum degree is 20 to 100 Pa, the flow rate of SiH2CQ2 is 20 to 100 SCCM, and the flow rate of NH3 is 50 to 500 SCCM. In the case of using a CVD method, the concave portion can be filled with the silicon oxide film under the conditions of, e.g., the growth temperatures of 350 to 450 OC, 4 SiH4 of a flow rate of 500 to 2000 SCCM, and O2 of a flow rate of 500.to 1500 SCCM. In the case of using a spin on glass method, the concave portion can be filled with a dielectric material such as a silicon oxide film or the like by use of, for example, a silica film source of anSiO2 concentration of 3 to 6 under the condition of a rotating speed of 1000 to 3000 rpm. According to a bias sputtering method, on one hand, the concave portion can be filled with a silicon oxide film under the. conditions of, e.g., a substrate bias voltage of 50 to 200 V, an accelerating voltage of 800 to 1400 V, and a vacuum degree of 3 X 7 x 10 1 Pa. The concave portion is filled with the dielectric material or polysilicon 21 by the above method and the dielectric material or polysilicon of the portions other than the concave portion is then removed due to an etch back method Fig. 8 B . In this example, the oxide film 20 and the region surrounded by the oxide film 20 become the insulating region 8. In the case of burying polysilicon 21 into the portion inside of the concave portion, polysilicon 21 can be used as an electrode or wiring to apply a potential to the n region 7. Thereafter, the photoelectric converting device is manufactured by the steps similar to those shown in Figs. 6 F to 6 K . In addition to an etch back method, the dielectric material 21 can be also flattened by a lift off method which will be explained hereinbelow. The step of Fig. 6 D and subsequent steps may be also carried out by the following lift off method. Figs. 9 A to 9 C are diagrams for explaining the fourth manufacturing process of the embodiment. In the step of Fig. 6 D , the concave portion is formed due to an etching and As ions are implanted and thereafter a photo resist 22 is left without being removed Fig. 9 A . Next, a dielectric material 23 e.g., silicon oxide film or silicon nitride film is deposited onto the concave portion and resist 22 due to an ECR plasmaCVD method, a spin on glass method, or the like Fig.9 B . In the case of forming the silicon oxide film by an ECR plasma method, the conditions are such that, for example, the RF power is 500 W, the flow rate ofSiH4 is 5 to 50 SCCM, the flow rate of N2 is 5 to 50SCCM, the vacuum degree of 3 x 10 2 to 1 x 10 1 Pa, and the deposition speed is 50 to 600 min . As mentioned above, the silicon oxide film may be also formed by a spin on glass method. Next, only the dielectric material 23 in the concave portion is left by removing the resist 22 and subsequently ion implanted As is thermally diffused in the N2 gas, thereby forming the n region 7.Therefore, in this example, the dielectric material 23 forms the insulating region 8. Then, the nitride film 6 and oxide film 5 are removed Fig. 9 C . Thereafter, the photoelectric converting device is formed by the steps similar to those shown in Figs. 6 F to 6 K . Although the n semiconductor was used for the semiconductor region just under the insulating region 8 in this embodiment, the invention is not obviously limited to this. In the case of a PNP bipolar transistor, a p semiconductor may be used. As described in detail above, in the photoelectric converting device according to this embodiment, since the semiconductor region having a high concentration is formed under the insulating region, an amount of etching is small and a width of isolating region is narrow and also the deep isolation can be attained. Since the amount of etching is small, a damage which is exerted to the semiconductor can be reduced and the occurrence of the crystal fault and a leak current between elements can be suppressed.Consequently, the crosstalk between cells can be minimized and a high resolution can be realized. In addition, a lateral width of isolating region can be reduced and sufficient isolation between elements can be accomplished, so that the invention is suitable for realization of higher integration and higher resolution as compared with the conventional device.
