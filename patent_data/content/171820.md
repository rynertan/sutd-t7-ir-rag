# Apparatus and method for ultrasonic detection of inclusions in molten metals.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for ultrasonically detecting inclusions in molten metals. The apparatus includes a probe 10 comprising an inert refractory shell 14 , a window 22 supported by the shell 14 for carrying ultrasonic waves between a coupling medium 16 and a body 12 of molten metal, and a coupling medium 16 contained within the shell 14 for carrying ultrasonic waves between a transducer 20 and the window 22 . A preferred apparatus utilizes a coupling medium 16 comprising liquid gallium and is suitable for detecting inclusions in molten aluminium and aluminium alloys.
