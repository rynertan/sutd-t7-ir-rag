# Thermal head.

## Abstract
A thermal head for a thermal printer or a thermal transfer printer wherein a substrate linearly formed with a plurality of heating elements and a control substrate for controlling genera tion of heat of said heating elements are mounted on different surfaces having respectively certain angles of a heat sink, whereby a printing mechanism can be simplified and compacted in construction. Particularly, where the thermal head is applied to a multicolor recording apparatus, it is possible to increase the recording speed and miniaturize the apparatus.
