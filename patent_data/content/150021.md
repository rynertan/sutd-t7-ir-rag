## Description
POLYPHERYLENE ETHER RESIN COMPOSITIONS HAVING ItSROVFD MELT FLOW AND PAINTABILITY BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The polyphenylene ether resins alone or together with alkenyl aromatic polymers have been known for some time as a family of engineering thermoplastics which can be shaped into a variety of articles characterized by good chemical, physical and electrical properties. The polyphenylene ether resins and methods of their preparation are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,306,874 and 3,306,875 Hay , in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,257,357 and 3,257,358 Stamatoff , and elsewhere. Poly alkenyl aromatics as co ingredients and modifiers for the polyphenylene ether resins are described by Cizek in U.S. Patent No. 3,383,435. Among the alkyl aromatic polymers which have become known in the art as suitable for use with polyphenylene ethers are high impact, rubber modified polystyrene resins, for example, polybutadiene modified polystyrene. The polyphenylene ether resins can also be blended with alkenyl aromatic resins which have been modified by grafting with rubbery interpolymers of alpha olefins and a diene known also as EPDM rubber , as is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.3,981,841 3,960,808 3,943,191 4,101,503 4,139,574 4,172,929 4,172,826 and 4,196,116. Polyethylene is another polymer which has been used in polyphenylene ether resin blends. Typically added in small amounts, this polymer acts as a lubricant or processing aid for the resin, while also conferring some improvement in the impact strength in the molded article. A shortcoming, however, is that even small amounts of polyethylene can and often do adverseiy affect the adhesion of paints and metalized finishes to the surface of the moldings. If the poly ethylene is replaced with the same amount of a linear block copolymer or radial teleblock copolymer, there are comparable improvements in the impact strength and the paint adhesion is better1 but the processability,and more specifically, the stability of melt fly , is not as good. INTRODUCTION TO THE INVENTION It has now been discovered that a small amount, up to 5 percent by weight, of a rubbery interpolymer of alpha olefins and a diene, can be added to a blend of a polyphenylene ether resin and an alkenyl aromatic resin to improve the melt processability, but with much better retention of paint adhesion after molding in comparison with the same amount of polyethylene in the blend. As utilized in the present invention, the rubbery interpolymer of alpha olefins and a diene, which is free of and unassociated with any other polymer in the blends, is distinguishable from those EPDM rubbers which heretofore have been employed to structurally modify the alkenyl aromatic resin by graft copolymerization therewith. ore over, just small amounts are used, from about 0.5 up to 5 percent by weight, for each 100 parts of the polyphenylene ether resin and high impact polystyrene combined, which is enough to provide the desired improvements in processability without serious detraction fran the adhesion of paints to the surfaces of the molded article. Sar increase in the impact strength may also result fran the addition.
