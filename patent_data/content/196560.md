## Description
The invention relates to a table moving type work system according to the features indicated in the preamble of claim 1. The invention starts out from a prior art as it is known from US 4 274 529. This document shows a work system in which a work table is provided which allows movements with two degrees of freedom for a substrate and electronic parts are sequentially mounted on predetermined portions of a substrate by means of an electronic part mounting device. The work table is arranged to be reciprocated between a feeding position, a receiving position and a working position so that a substrate is fed from a substrate feeding means at a substrate feeding position and coincidentally an electronic part mounted substrate is received with a substrate receiving means at a substrate receiving position. This system suffers the problem that the electronic part mounting operations are interrupted while the work table is parted from the working position for the substrate feeding receiving operations. These interrupts cause a considerable waste of time. The object of the invention is to furtherdevelop a work system according to the preamble of claim 1 so that a rationell work flow is possible. According to the invention this object is solved by the features of claim 1. These features not only make possible to efficiently accurately perform the transferring of the work piece between the feeding table and the work table and between the discharging table and the work table, but also makes possible to take advantage of successively performing the work without interruption. The invention is advantageously developed by the measures mentioned in the subclaims. The object and features of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which The same or corresponding elements and parts are designated at like reference numerals and characters throughout the drawings. Referring now to Figs. 1 through 3, there is illustrated a work system for sequentially mounting electronic parts on predetermined portions of a work piece such as substrate. In the drawings, illustrated at the reference numeral 1 is a feeding table which is arranged to be reciprocated between a work piece feeding device 2 and a work table 3 along Y axis in the drawings so that a work piece substrate A discharging table 4 goes and returns between the work table 3 and a work piece receiving device 5 along Y axis in the drawings so that the work piece The work piece feeding device 2 includes a guide rail 21 disposed so that the work piece The feeding table 1 is reciprocated between the work piece feeding device 2 and the work table 3, i.e., a feeding position P and a connecting position Q, which are predetermined with respect to a base of the work system, by means of a feed screw shaft 11 disposed along Y axis. The feed screw shaft 11 is rotated by means of a motor 12 driven under control of a control unit 9 whereby the feeding table 1 is reciprocated. The movement of the feeding table 1 is shown in Fig. 4. The reference numeral 13 represents a guide rod. The feeding table 1 has a rail 14 for guiding the work piece The work table 3 goes and returns with respect to a position, which is coincident with the connecting position Q, along Y axis by means of rotation of a feed screw shaft 31. The rotation of the feed screw shaft 31 is given by a motor 32, the operation of which is controlled by the control unit 9, and the work table 3 is controlled to cause the movements as shown in Fig. 4. The reference numeral 33 designates a guide rod. The work table 3 has a guide rail 34 for introducing the work piece The discharging table 4 is reciprocated between a connecting position which is coincident with the working position Q in Y axis direction and a discharging position which is coincident with the feeding position P in Y axis direction by rotation of a feed screw shaft 41. the rotation thereof is given by a motor 42 the operation of which is controlled by the control unit 9. The movement thereof is controlled as illustrated in Fig. 4. The reference numeral 43 represents a guide rod. The discharging table 4 has a guide rail 44 for introducing the work piece The work piece receiving device 5 includes an air cylinder 53 having a drawing rod 52 for drawing the work piece The control unit 9 comprises, for example, a microcomputer and the movements and operations of the respective tables and air cylinders are controlled in accordance with the program stored in a Read only memory ROM of the microcomputer. Fig. 4 illustrates the movements of the feeding table 1, work table 3, and discharging table 4 which are controlled by the control unit 9. As understood from Fig. 4, the feeding table 1 is reciprocated between the connecting position Q at which the feeding table 1 is connected to the work table 1 as illustrated in Fig. 3 and the feeding position P at which a work piece is transferred by the work piece feeding device 2 to the feeding table 1 during the electronic part mounting work so that a work piece The discharging table 4 is reciprocated between the connecting position Q at which the discharging table 4 is coupled to the work table 1 and the discharging position P at which the discharging table 4 is coupled to the work piece receiving device 5, during the electronic part mounting work so that a work piece This not only makes possible to smooth perform the transferring of the work piece, but also makes possible to successively mount electronic parts on the work piece without interruption. Note here that although the feeding table 1 and discharging table 3 are described in this embodiment as being reciprocated only along Y axis in the drawings, the concept of the present invention is not necessarily limited to such movements and if required, the movement thereof can be replaced by other movements, for example, X axis or X axis and Y axis with appropriate arrangement as long as they are respectively reciprocated between the work piece feeding device 2 and the work table 3 and between the work table 3 and the work piece receiving device 5.
