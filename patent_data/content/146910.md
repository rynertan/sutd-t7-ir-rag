# Level converting circuit.

## Abstract
A level converter for transforming differential input voltages into an output voltage comprises a voltage current conversion circuit 1 for transforming the differential input voltages into differential currents, a current detection circuit 2 for detecting the differential currents, a current amplifying circuit 3 for amplifying the differential currents in response to the output of the current detection circuit, and a current voltage conversion circuit 4 for transforming the amplified differential currents into an output voltage, thereby allowing fast operation and drastic level conversion.
