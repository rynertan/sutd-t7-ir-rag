# Fastener assembly and method of making the same.

## Abstract
An improved fastener assembly, may be used to mount a vehicle wheel on a hub, includes a nut which is rotatable relative to a washer to enable the fastener assembly to be tightened without marrings the whell. The washer has an annular collar which is loosely connected with the nut by a retainer section which extends from one axial end portion of the nut. The nut and washer collar have abutting annular load transmitting surface areas. The washer also has an annular load transmitting and indicating section which extends radially outwardly from the collar. The load transmitting and indicating section includes a bearing section and a spring section may be provided with undulations. When the fastener assembly is tightened with a predetermined preload, the spring section is flattened to provide a visual indication that the desired preload has been applied. Flattening the spring section maximizes the surface areas for transmitting the preload to the wheel.
