## Description
This invention relates to a silver halide color photo sensitive material capable of displaying a high color developability and producing an image having a high preservability and in particular an excellent color fastness to light. Generally, in a silver halide color photosensitive material, a dye image may be obtained in that exposed silver halide grains are reduced by making use of an aromatic primary amine color developing agent and the resulting oxidation products of the above mentioned color developing agent are coupled to the couplers for producing yellow, magenta or cyan dyes, respectively. There are generally known an open chained ketomethylene yellow coupler for forming the above mentioned yellow dyes a pyrazolone magenta coupler and an 1H pyrazolo 3,2 c s triazole magenta coupler for forming the magenta dyes and a phenol cyan coupler, a naphthol cyan coupler or the like for forming the cyan dyes. Such couplers as mentioned above and the dyes obtained therefrom should satisfy various requirements when they are to be put into practical use. The couplers are, for example, required to possess as high as possible a coupling rate, i.e., the color developability, when they couple to the oxidation products of a color developing agent and the couplers and the dyes obtained therefrom are required to be stable for long preservation, in particular against light, i.e., a color fastness to light and the couplers are also required to possess as low as possible unnecessary side or collateral absorption. If the above mentioned requirements should be satisfied by only some part of the yellow, magenta and cyan coulers, unbalanced colors will appear. It is, therefore, necessary for all these requirements to be satisfied where all the three kinds of couplers are in combination. The conventional dyes produced from yellow, magenta or cyan couplers have so far been disadvantageous in that the color fastness to light thereof is unsatisfactory and an unbalance of colors is caused by the irradiation of light for a long time because the three kinds of dyes are different from each other in their color fastness to light. It is an object of the invention to provide a silver halide color photo sensitive material not only capable of keeping stable over a long preservation time and in particular the color balance even when it is irradiated by light for a long time, but also capable of displaying an excellent color developability. The above mentioned objects of the invention have, to a large extent, been attained by a silver halide color photo sensitive material, which forms the subject of the present invention, comprising a reflective support bearing thereon a green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing a magenta coupler having the following Formula I , a blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing a yellow coupler having the following Formula II , and a red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing a cyan coupler having the following Formula III or IV . wherein R₁ represents a substituent connected via tertiary carbon atom R₂ represents an alkyl group or an aryl group and X represents a split off group other than hydrogen, which is capable of splitting off through a reaction with the oxidation products of a color developing agent. wherein X₁ represents a halogen, an alkoxy group or an alkyl group Y₁ represents a group capable of splitting off when a dye is formed by coupling the group with the oxidation products of an aromatic primary amine color developing agent R₄ represents a substituent for a benzene ring and n is an integer of 1 or 2. wherein R₅ represents an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms R₆ represents hydrogen or an alkyl group having 1 to 15 carbon atoms and R₇ represents a halogen, an alkyl group, a hydroxy group or an acyloxy group. wherein R₈ represents an alkyl group, a halogen, a sulfonamido group, a sulfamoyl group, an arylsulfonyl group, or a hydroxy group R₉ represents hydrogen or an alkyl group and R₁₀ represents hydrogen, a halogen, an alkyl group, a sulfamoyl group or a sulfonamido group. EP A 0095722 discloses a similar material except that the magenta coupler is a pyrazole type coupler. DE A 3339201 and FR A 2075583 discloses IH pyrazole 3,2 c S triazole magenta couplers. EP A 0178788, which may form part of the state of the art by virtue of Article 54 3 EPC discloses silver halide color photographic materials which have at least one silver halide emulsion layer on a support, the layer containing at least one magenta coupler of formula I in which R₁ is a tertiary alkyl group, R₂ is a secondary or tertiary alkyl group and X is as defined above.

The magenta couplers used in the invention can be represented by the following Formula I wherein R₁ represents a substituent connected via a tertiary carbon atom, typically a tertiary alkyl group R₂ represents an alkyl group or an aryl group and X represents a split off group other than hydrogen, which is capable of splitting off through a reaction with the oxidation products of a color developing agent. The tertiary carbon atom of the group R₁ can be substituted by an alkyl group, an aryl group such as a phenyl group, or an alkoxy group, for example. In addition, the tertiary carbon atom can form part of another cyclic group. Furthermore, an alkyl group attached to the tertiary carbon atom can be substituted by a halogen atom or an alkoxy group, for example.

The alkyl group represented by R₂ can be a methyl, primary alkyl, or branched secondary or tertiary alkyl group. The primary alkyl group represents an alkyl group in which two hydrogen atoms are attached to the linking carbon the secondary alkyl group represents an alkyl group in which one hydrogen atom is attached to the linking carbon and the tertiary alkyl group represents an alkyl group in which no hydrogen atom is attached to the linking carbon. An alkyl group represented by R₂ can be substituted by, for example, an aryl group, heterocyclic group, a halogen atom, cyano group substituents linked through a carbonyl group such as alkoxycarbonyl, acyl or carbamoyl groups and substituents linked through a hetero atom such as nitro, alkoxy, alkylthio, arylthio, alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, alkylsulfinyl, arylsulfinyl and dialkylamino groups. However, such a substituent group is preferably selected from among alkylthio, arylthio, alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, alkylsulfinyl, and arylsulfinyl groups.

Further, needless to say, magenta forming couplers in the invention include also bis type 1H pyrazolo 3,2 c s triazole compounds, which are formed when the heterocyclic residue is a 1H pyrazolo 3,2 c s triazole 3 yl residue. The split off group represented by X can be, for example, a halogen atom, or an organic group linked in a coupling position, through an oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur atom. Among such split off groups those linked through an oxygen atom include alkoxy, aryloxy, acyloxy, and heteroclycloxy groups. Those linked, in the coupling position, via a nitrogen atom include acylamino, diacylamino, and sulfonamido groups, and the nitrogen containing 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic groups. Those linked, in the coupling position, through an sulfur atom include thiocyano, alkylthio, arylthio, heterocyclothio, arylsulfonyl, and alkylsulfonyl groups.

Exemplary compounds represented by the Formula IV is listed as follows The cyan developing couplers represented by Formula III or IV can be used either singly or in combination with each other. As for the magenta developing couplers, each of these couplers can be used either singly or in combination. In addition, it can be used in combination with well known conventional couplers including pyrazolone, indazolone, cyanoacetyl, pyrazolinobenzimidazole, and pyrazolotriazole compounds. Further, a colored coupler having a color correcting effect, or a coupler DIR coupler releasing a development inhibitor, can be used in combination with the specified coupler if necessary. The specified magenta forming coupler, and other couplers used in combination with said magenta forming coupler can be incorporated into a silver halide emulsion layer according to well known methods including the method described in U.S. Patent No. 2,322,027. The couplers are, for example, dissolved in a a solvent such as an alkyl phthalate such as dibutyl phthalate, and dioctyl phthalate phosphoric acid ester such as diphenyl phosphate, triphenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, and dioctyl butyl phosphate citric acid ester such as tributyl acetylcitrate benzoic acid ester such as octyl benzoate alkylamide such as diethyllauramide aliphatic acid ester such as dibutoxyethyl succinate, and dioctyl azelate trimesic acid ester such as tributyl trimesate and an organic solvent boiling at about 30 to 150 C such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl propionate, sec butyl alcohol, methyl isobutyl ketone, β ethoxyethyl acetate, and methyl cellosolve acetate, and then dispersed into a hydrophilic colloid. As a solvent, a mixture of a higher boiling solvent, and a lower boiling solvent among the above can be used. In addition, the dispersing process with polymer, described in Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 39853 1976, and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 59943 1976, also can be used. The magenta forming coupler is typically added to a silver halide emulsion in the range of 0.005 to 2 moles per mole of silver halide and preferably 0.03 to 0.5 moles per mole of silver halide. While the dye image formed by the magenta forming coupler generally exhibits a strong light resistance by itself, the light resistance can be further improved by means of the combined use of an antifading agent, or by the addition of a UV absorber containing layer on the upper side. As such an antifading agent, there are cited, for example, hydroquinone derivatives described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,360,290, 2,418,613, 2,675,314, 2,701,197, 2,704,713, 2,728,659 2,732,300, 2,735,765, 2,710,801 and 2,816,028, and British Patent No. 1,363,921 gallic acid derivatives described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,457,079 and 3,069,262 p alkoxyphenol compounds described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,735,765, and 3,698,909, and Japanese Patent Examined Publication Nos. 20977 1974 and 6623 1977 p hydroxyphenol derivatives described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,432,300, 3,573,050, 3,574,627 and 3,764,337, and Japanese Patent O.P.I.

Publication No. 2784 1971 cinnamic acid ester compounds described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,705,805 and 3,707,375 butadiene compounds described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,045,229 benzoxidole compounds and compounds described in U.S. Patent No. 3,499,762, and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 48535 1979. As silver halide used in the silver halide emulsion in the invention, there can be cited those used commonly in silver halide emulsions in the art such as silver bromide, silver chloride, silver iodobromide, silver chlorobromide, and silver chloroiodobromide. Silver halide used in the invention can be spectrosensitized by an appropiately selected sensitizing dye so as to be provided with the color sensitivity to the light of the required range of wavelength. Suitable sensitizing dyes include cyanine dyes, merocyanine dyes, composite cyanine dyes, composite merocyanine dyes, homopolar cyanine dyes, hemicyanine dyes, styryl dyes, and hemioxonole dyes. Especially useful sensitizing dyes are those described, for example, in West German Patent No. 929,080 U.S. Patent Nos. 2,231,658, 2,493,748, 2,503,776, 2,519,001, 2,912,329, 3,656.959, 3,672,897, 3,694,217, 4,025,349 and 4,046,572 British Patent No. 1,242,588 and Japanese Patent Examined Publication Nos. 14030 1969 and 24544 1977. While these sensitising dyes can be present either singly or in combination, they are often used in combination for the purpose of intensive sensitization, as typically shown, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,688,545, 2,977,229, 3,897,060, 3,522,052, 3,527,641, 3,617,293, 3,628,964, 3,666,480, 3,672,898, 3,679,428, 3,703,377, 3,769,301, 3,814,609, 3,837,862 and 4,026,707 British Patent Nos. 1,344,281 and 1,507,803 Japanese Patent Examined Publication Nos. 4936 1968 and 12375 1978 and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 110618 1977 and 109925 1977. Silver halide emulsions used in the invention can contain various well known photographic additives described, for example, in Research Disclosure, No. 17643. The support of the silver halide color photo sensitive material of the invention can be selected from among well known materials including plastic film, plastic laminated paper, baryta paper, and synthetic paper, according to the intended purpose. The silver halide color photo sensitive material of the invention can have arbitrarily any layer structure used in the present art. The silver halide color photo sensitive material of the invention can be submitted to various color developing processes after exposure. Color developing agents of the aromatic primary amine type which can be used include well known compounds widely used in various color photographic processings. These developing agents include both aminophenol derivatives, and p phenylenediamine derivatives. In general, these compounds are used in the form of a salt such as the hydrochloride, and sulfate rather than in the form of free amine, because of more stable nature of the salt. They are usually used at concentrations from 0.1 to 30 grams, and preferably from 1 to 1.5 grams, per liter of developer. The developing agents of aminophenol type include o aminophenol, p aminophenol, 5 amino 2 hydroxytoluene, 2 amino 3 hydroxytoluene, and 2 hydroxy 3 amino 1,4 dimethylbenzenyl, for example. Especially useful color developing agents of aromatic primary amine type are N,N dialkyl p phenylenediamine compounds, whose alkyl groups and or phenylene group can have various substituent groups. Thus, especially useful compounds include N,N diethyl p phenylenediamine hydrochloride, N methyl p phenylenediamine hydrochloride, N,N dimethyl p phenylenediamine hydrochloride, 2 amino 5 N ethyl N dodecylamino toluene, N ethyl N β methanesulfonamidoethyl 3 methyl 4 aminoaniline sulfate, N ethyl N β hydroxyethlaminoaniline, 4 amino 3 methyl N,N diethylaniline, and 4 amino N 2 methoxyethyl N ethyl 3 methylaniline p toluenesulfonate, for example. A color developer used in processing the material of the invention can contain, besides the above color developing agent of aromatic primary amine type, various additives, which are commonly added to color developers, such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, and other alkaline agents alkali metal sulfites, alkali metal bisulfites, alkali metal thiocyanates, alkali metal halides, benzyl alcohol, water softening agents, and thickening agents. The pH of the color developer is usually more than 7.0, and very often 10 to 13. After color development, the silver halide photo sensitive material of the invention can be treated by a processing solution capable of fixing the color. When the processing solution is a fixer, the material is preliminarily submitted to a bleaching treatment. A metal complex of an organic acid is typically used as a bleaching agent in the bleaching solution or bleach fix solution used in the bleaching process. Such a metal complex is capable of oxidizing metallic silver, formed through the developing process, to silver halide, and of color developing undeveloped part of the color developing agent at the same time. The metal complex is formed by coordinating a metal such as iron, cobalt, or copper to an organic acid such as an aminopolycarboxylic acid, oxalic acid, and citric acid. The organic acid is preferably a polycarboxylic acid, or aminopolycarboxylic acid. The polycarboxylic acid or aminopolycarboxylic acid is useful also in the form of its alkali metal or ammonium salt, or water soluble amine salt. Thus organic acids, and their salts useful to form metal complexes include the following typical compounds The beaching solution used in said processing can contain various additives besides the above organic acid salts. Such additives especially include an alkali metal or ammonium halide as a rehalogenating agent such as potassium bromide, sodium bromide, sodium chloride, and ammonium bromide metal salts and sequestering agents. The bleaching solution can contain also various other additives well known as common bleaching solution additives, such as borates, oxalates, acetates, carbonates and phosphates as pH buffer agent alkylamines and polyethylene oxide compounds. Further, the fixer or bleach fix solution can contain, either singly or in combination, a pH buffer composed of sulfites such as ammonium sulfite, potassium sulfite, ammonium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, ammonium metabisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, and sodium metabisulfite boric acid, borax, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide salts such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, and sodium acetate acetic acid, and ammonium hydroxide. When the bleach fix processing is conducted while more bleach fix solution is added to the bleach fix bath, such salts as thiosulfates, thiocyanates, and bisulfites can be present either in said bleach fix bath, or the supplementary bleach fix solution. In the invention, it is allowed, for the purpose of improving the activity of the bleach fix solution, that air or oxygen is blown into either bath or storage vessel of the solution, or that an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide, bromate, and persulfate is added. Each of the Samples of silver halide color photo sensitivity material listed in Table 1 was prepared by applying the following layers on polyethylene resin coated paper containing anatase titanium dioxide, in the described order. Each quantity is represented as mg per 100 cm² of the paper. Each of Layers 1 to 6 was included a coating aid, and each of Layers 4 and 6 included a gelatin cross linking agent. As a UV absorber for Layers 2 and 4, a mixture of the following UV 1 and UV 2 was used As an antioxidant for Layer 2,5 tert pentylhydroquinone dioctyl ether was used. Each of the above multilayered photo sensitive materials was exposed to light through an optical wedge and was then developed according the following steps. The test results are shown in Table 1. In each of the processing steps, the following processing solution was used. The light resistance was determined in the following way In the table, Y, M, C represent the light resistance of the dye images produced by yellow, magenta and cyan couplers, respectively. As is obvious from Table 1, any combination of the yellow, magenta and cyan couplers used in the invention can display an excellent light resistance and can stabilize the color balance of a color image formed in a color photographic light sensitive material even when irradiated by light for a long period of time.
