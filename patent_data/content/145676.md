# PNEUMATIC DEVICE ABLE TO TRANSITORIALLY ENRICH THE MIXTURE DELIVERED BY A CARBURETOR FOR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES

## Abstract
A device suitable to transitorially enrich the mixture de livered by a carburetor includes a housing 1 , enclosing two chambers 5 and 6 , which are separated by a diaphragm 3 chamber 5 communicates with the manifold through a channel 7 chamber 6 communicates with chamber 5 through a metering hole 8 , which crosses the plates 4a and 4b a spring 9 and the forces due to pressures acting on the 2 diaphragm sides 3 act on the diaphragm 3 a chamber 13 separated from the chamber 6 by a diaphragm 11 , communicates with the float, chamber 2 through an inlet and with the main circuit 15 through an outlet 16 , closed by a valve formed by a spring 18 , suitable for pushing a sphere 19 on a seat 17 . A bar 20 integral to the diaphragms 3, 11 supports a pushing rod 24 , which under the action of pressure forces acting on the diaphragm 3 removes the sphere 19 from the seat 17 , opening the outlet passage. The fuel is metered out by a bush 25 .
