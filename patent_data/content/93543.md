# Aromatics production.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for converting a feedstock comprising aliphatic or alicyclic hydrocarbons into aromatic hydrocarbons by bringing into contact in a fluid phase a mixture of the feedstock and an oxidising agent other than molecular oxygen or a gas containing molecular oxygen into contact with a solid acidic catalyst having Brönsted acid sites. The process is particularly suitable for converting methane, ethane and or ethylene into aromatics. The solid acidic catalyst with Brönsted acid sites may be an aluminosilicate zeolite with a silica to alumina ratio greater than 12 1. The oxidizing agents other than molecular oxygen or a gas containing molecular oxygen may be selected from nitrous oxide, sulphur trioxide, hydrogen peroxide, ozone, nitric oxide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxyfluoride. The process yields high octane value aromatics even from methane at relatively low conversion temperatures.
