# OPTICAL CONNECTORS

## Abstract
An optical connector comprises first and second mating coupling members. The first member has two conductive terminal portions for connection to a driver circuit for a light emitting element, and the second member has a conductive portion which contacts the two terminal portions when the first and second members are coupled together for estab lishing electrical connection between the terminal portions.
