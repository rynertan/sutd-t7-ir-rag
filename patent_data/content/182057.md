# Corrosion inhibited antifreeze composition.

## Abstract
A corrosion inhibited antifreeze composition using a three part corrosion inhibitor mixture is described. A dicar boxylic acid component, an alkali metal silicate and a tri azole comprise the three corrosion inhibitors. Use of this type of mixture permits the express exclusion of amines, nitrites, nitrates, chromates, borates and phosphates and their attendant disadvantages. Nevertheless, the inventive system provides excellent corrosion resistance in alcohol based antifreeze, particularly with respect to aluminum.
