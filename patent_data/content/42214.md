# Tank.

## Abstract
A fuel tank for a motor cycle has a filling orifice recessed below the top of the tank whereby air spaces will be maintained above the fuel level at all times. A protrusion or blister at one side of the tank at the lowest level of the tank forms a sump from which fuel enters an engine supply pipe. The pipe extends transver sely below the tank and then turns upwardly to ter minate at an open end above maximum fuel level thus acting as a tank vent. Another pipe tapped from the point of upturn leads fuel to the engine. If the cycle were to fall over on one side when the blister will be at the highest point, the tank air space will be transferred to the blister effectively isolating the engine supply pipe from the fuel. Should the cycle fall over on the other side, air will enter the open end of the fuel supply pipe to destroy any siphon which might otherwise act to drain fuel from the tank. In either case, fuel spillage will be limited to whatever small quantity is in the fuel supply pipe system. The filler orifice is of course taken to be properly closed.
