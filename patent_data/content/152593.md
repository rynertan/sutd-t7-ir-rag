# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING A CATALYST FOR THE POLYMERIZATION OF OLEFINES

## Abstract
By including filter means in the conduit used to decant liquids which have been used to contact a catalyst com ponent or catalyst prepared for the polymerization of ol efins, the catalyst and polymers prepared therewith are improved. For example, with a supported transition metal catalyst the catalyst productivity is increased and the proportion of fines in polyethylene prepared therewith is reduced.
