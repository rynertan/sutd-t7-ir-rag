## Description
CARBOXYLIC ACID DERIVATIVES USEFUL FOR INEIBITINC TEE DEGIZADATION OF CARTILAGE This application relates to new chemical compounds. More particularly, it relates to new chemical compounds which have the ability to inhibit the degradation of cartilage, when administered to a mammalian subject afflicted with an arthritic disease. Cartilage is a proteinaceous material found in the joints of mammals. It is an elastic, spongy substance which covers the articular surfaces cf the bones within the synovial cavity. The presence of cartilage, with its special properties of compressi ability, elasticity and deformability, permits joints to carry out their two major functions, which are to bear weight and facilitate locomotion. However, in certain disease states of mammals, such as osteoarthritis or hypertrophic arthritis, degeneration of joints occurs, and a major component of this degeneration is loss, or degeneration, of cartilage. It is an object of this invention to provide a method for inhibiting the degradation of cartilage in a joint of a mammalian subject. This invention provides new chemical compounds of the formulaEMI2.1 and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof and the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts thereof, wherein X is selected from the group consisting of O, S,SO, SO and NR2 R is selected from the group consisting of H and CE3 Y is selected from the group consisting of OH, OR3 and NER4 and n is zero or one wherein R2 is selected from the group consisting of H, CE3 and CO CE3 R3 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl having 1 to 5 carbons and phenyl and R4 is selected from the group consisting ofH, alkyl having I to 5 carbons, phenyl, hydroxyphenyl and 5 tetrazolyl. Further, this invention provides a method for inhibiting the degradation of cartilage in a joint of a mammalian subject afflicted with an arthritic disease, which comprises administering to said subject a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Yet further, this invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferred compounds of the invention are the compounds of formula I, wherein X is O. Within this preferred group, particularly preferred compounds are those in which R is CH3. An especially preferred individual compound of this invention is 4 E 2 4,4 dimethyl 6 chromanyl 2 methylvinyl benzoic acid, the compound of formula I, wherein X is O, R1 is CE3, Y is OR and n is zero. The compounds of formula I, wherein X is O, S,SO, S02 or NCOCE3, R1 is H or CE3, Y is OR3 and n is zero or one, wherein R3 is alkyl having l to 5 carbon or phenyl, can be prepared by reacting a phosphonium halide of the formula EMI4.1 wherein Z is chloro or bromo, with the appropriate aldehyde of the formulaEMI4.2 This is a typical Wittig reaction and it can be carried out in the normal manner for this type of transformation. However, a particularly convenient way of condensing II with III involves contacting substantially eguimolar amounts of II and IT in an epoxyalkane having 3 to 6 carbons at a temperature in the range from 30 to 1000 C, and preferably at about 600C.A particularly convenient epoxyalkane for use in this transformation is 1,2 epoxybutane. The reaction time varies according to the reaction temperature, but at about 600C reaction times of a few days, e.g. three days, are commonly used. At the end of the reaction, the product can be isolated by standard methods. For example, th product can be isolated by removing the ep xyclkane by evaporation in vacuo. The crude product thus obtained can be purified by standard methods such as recrystallization or chromatography, if desired. The compounds of formula I, wherein X is O, S,SO or SO2, Rl is H or CH3, Y is OH and n is zero or one, can be prepared from the corresponding compound of formula I, wherein Y is OR3 and R3 is alkyl having 1 to 5 carbon atoms or phenyl, by hydrolysis. This is normally carried out by treating said compound of formula I, wherein Y is OR3, with an excess of an aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide, e.g.sodium or potassium hydroxide, or an alkaline earth metal hydroxide, e.g. magnesium or barium hydroxIde, or an alkali metal carbonate, e.g. sodium or potassium carbonate. A cosolvent such as a lower alkanol, e.g.methanol or ethanol, can be added if desired. The reaction is usually run at a temperature in the range from 40 to 100 C, and preferably about 800C. It usually takes a few hours, e.g. two hours, to reach completion. The product is then isolated by standard methods. For example, in one method, the cosolvent is removed by evaporation, the resulting mixture is acidified, and then the product is extracted into a volatile, organic solvent which is not miscible with water. Finally, the product is recovered by solvent evaporation. It can be purified by standard techniques, such as recrystallization. The compounds of the formula I, wherein X is NH, R1 is H or CE3, Y is OH and n is zero or one, are prepared from the corresponding compound of formula I, wherein X is NCOCH3 and Y is OH or OR3, wherein R3 is alkyl having 1 to 5 carbons or phenyl, by hydrolysis.This hydrolysis is carried out in exactly the same manner that was described earlier for preparation of a compound of formula I, wherein X is O, S, SO or SO2 R1is H or CE3, Y is OH and n is zero or one. The compounds of formula I, wherein X is NCOCH,, R is H or CE3, Y is OH and n is zero or one, are prepared by hydrolysis of the corresponding compound, wherein Y is OR , wherein R3 is alkyl having 1 to 5 carbons or phenyl. This is carried out by treating the starting material with an excess of an aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide, e.g. sodium or potassium hydroxide, or an alkaline earth metal hydroxide, e.g. magnesium or barium hydroxide, or an alkali metal carbonate, e.g. sodium or potassium carbonate. Also a cosolvent such as a lower alkanol, e.g methanol or ethanol, can be added if desired.However, in order to avoid hydrolysis of the NCOCH3 moiety, the reaction is run at a temperature in the range from 15 to 300C, and preferably at about 20C. At about 250C, the reaction is normally complete within about 48 hours, and then the product can be isolated in exactly the same manner as described earlier for a compound of formula I, wherein X is O,S, SO or SO2, R1 is H or CE3, Y is OH and n is zero or one. The compounds of formula I, wherein X is SO, R1 is H or C83, Y is OH, OR3 or NER4, and n is zero or one, wherein R3 is alkyl having l to 5 carbons atoms or phenyl and R4 is H, alkyl having i to 5 carbon atoms, phenyl, hydroxyphenyl or 5 tetrazolyl1 can also be prepared from the corresponding compound of formula Z, wherein X is S. This is achieved by oxidation of the sulfide moiety to a sulfoxide moiety, and a variety of reagents known in the art for this kind of transformation can be used. However, particularly convenient conditions for this purpose are the use of sodium metaperiodate in.aqueous dioxane at about oec. In like manner, the compounds of formula I, wherein X is S02 This H or CE3, Y is OH, OR or NHR4, and n is zero or one, wherein R3 is alkyl having 1 to 5 carbons atoms or phenyl and R4 is H, alkyl having l to 5 carbon atoms, phenyl, hydroxyphenyl or 5 tetrazolyl, can also be prepared from the corresponding compound of formula I, wherein X is S.This is achieved by oxidation of the sulfide moiety to a sulfone moiety, and a variety of reagents known in the art for this kind of transformation can be used. However, particularly convenient conditions for this purpose are the use of a peroxy carboxylic acid, such as 3 chloroperbenzoic acid, in a reactioninert organic solvent, such as chloroform. The compounds of formula I, wherein X is NCH3, Rl is H or CH3, Y is OH, OR or NHR4, and n is zero or one, wherein R3 is alkyl having I to 5 carbons atoms or phenyl and R4 is H, alkyl having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, phenyl, hydroxyphenyl or 5 tetrazolyl, can be prepared from the corresponding compound of formula I, wherein X is NH. This can be achieved by reductive methylation, and a convenient method involves treating the compound of formula I, whereinX is NH, with an excess of formaldehyde in refluxing formic acid. The compounds of formula I, wherein X is O, SOt SO2 or WR2, R1 is H or CE3 and Y is NHR4, whereinR2 is COCH3 and R4 is hydrogen, alkyl having 1 to 5 carbons, phenyl, hydroxyphenyl or 5 tetrazolyl, can be prepared from the corresponding compound of formula I, wherein.Y is OR. This is achieved by activation of the carboy group, e.g. by mixed anhydride formation, followed by reaction with an amine of formula R4 NH2. Thus, formation of the mixed anhydride involves suspending or dissolving an appropriate carboxylate salt of the carboxylic acid of formula I in a reaction inert organic solvent, and then adding to this suspension or solution a reagent selected from pivaloyl chloride and lower alkyl chloroformates. Appropriate salts are, for example, alkali metal salts, such as sodium or potassium salts, and amine salts, such as triethylammonium, pyridinium, N ethylpiperidinium or N , N dimethyl anilinium salts. Appropriate solvents are those which serve to dissolve at least one of the reactants, and the mixed anhydride product, and do not adversely interact with the reactants or product.Examples of such solvents are chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as chloroform and methylene chloride aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene and xylene and ethers, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and 1, 2 dimethcxyethane. The reaction is usually carried out at a temperature in the range from about SO0C to about 300C, and preferably at about 250C. At about 250C, the reaction commonly requires less than one hour. The salt of the compound of formula I and the pivaloyl chloride or lower alkyl chloroformate are normally present in roughly eguimolar proportions, although in some instances a small excess of the acid chloride component is used.The product can be isolated simply by filtering off the insoluble materials, and then evaporating the solvent in vacuo to give the crude product. The latter can be used directly, or purified further by methods known in the art. If desired, however, the mixed anhydride product need not be isolated. It can be used in situ for reaction with the amine of formula R4 NH2.Reaction of the mixed anhydride with the amine of formula R4 NH is usually carried out simply by 2 contacting the reactants in an inert solvent, for about 0.1 to about 2.0 hours, at a temperature in the range from about 300C to about 300C and preferably at around 25 C. The same solvents identified above for mixed anhydride formation are useful for this reaction, and the reagents are usually used in approximately equimolar proportions. In the cases wherein this reaction is conducted in a water im miscible solvent, the product is usually isolated by washing the reaction mixture with hydrochloric acid and then concentrating the organic solvent to dryness in vacuo, to give the crude product.The latter product can be purified further by well known methods, such as chromatography or recrystalllzation. The phosphonium halides of formula II are prepared by reaction of triphenylphosphine with the appropriate halo compound of the formulaEMI10.1 wherein X is O, S, SO, SC2 or NCOCH3, Rl is H or CE3, and Z is chloro or bromo, in refluxing toluene. The halo compounds of formula IV, wherein Z 15 chloro, can be prepared from the corresponding alcohol of the formulaEMI10.2 by reaction of an alcohol of formula V with thionyl chloride and pyridine, while the halo compounds of formula IV, wherein Z is bromo, can be prepared by reaction of an alcohol of formula V with phosphorus tribromide. The halo compounds of formula IV can also be prepared by halogenation of the corresponding compound of the formula EMI11.1 using standard methods For example, when Z is bromo the halogenation can be effected using N bromosuccinimide in carbon tetrachloride. The compounds of formula V, wherein X is O or S and R1 is H or CH3, can be prepared according toScheme I. SCHEME IEMI12.1 Firstly, 2 methyl 4 hydroxy l butene X is converted into its methanesulfonate ester IX , using methanesulfonyl chloride. Displacement of the methanesulfonyloxy group with the potassium salt of phenol or thiophenol then affords 2 methyl 4 phenoxy l butene VIII X is O or 2 methyl 4 thiophenoxy l butene VIII X is S . These latter materials are cyclized to 4,4 dimethylchroman VII X is O or 4,4 dimethylthiochroman VII X is S using liquid hydrogen fluoride.A compound of formula VII is then subjected to a Friedel Crafts reaction using acetyl chloride and aluminum chloride in carbon disulfide , to give the 6 acetyl derivative VI R1 is CE3 , or it can be subjected to a Vilsmeier reaction using phosphorus oxychloride and N,N dimethylformamide to give the 6 formyl derivative VI R1 is H . Finally, the ketone or aldehyde of formula VI is reduced with sodium borohydride in methanol. This affords the desired alcohol of formula V. An alcohol of formula V, wherein X is SO, can be prepared by oxidation of the corresponding compound, wherein X is S. This can be carried out in the same manner as that described for oxidation of a compound of formula I, wherein X is S, to a compound of formula I, wherein X is SO. Similarly, an alcohol of formula V, wherein X is SO2, can be prepared by oxidation of the corresponding compound of formula V, wherein X is S, and the method described for the oxidation z compound of formula I, wherein X is S to a compound of formula I, wherein X is S02 can be used. The compounds of formula V, wherein X is NCOCH3 and R1 is H or CE3, can be prepared according toScheme II. SCHEME IIEMI14.1 Firstly, 3 methyicrotonoyl chloride XV is reacted with aniline to give the amide XIV , which is then cyclized using aluminum chloride in the absence of solvent. Reduction of the 2 oxo 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroquinoline thus obtained XIII with lithium aluminum hydride in diethyl ether then gives the amine of formula XII. This latter amine is acetylated, using acetyl chloride in pyridine, to give the amide of formula XI. A compound of formula XI is then subjected to a Friedei Crafts reaction using acetyl chloride and aluminum chloride in carbon disulfide , to give the 6 acetyl derivative, or it can be subjected to a Vilsmeier reaction using phosphorus oxychloride and N,N dimethylformamide to give the 6formyl derivative.Finally, the ketone or aldehyde thus obtained is reduced with sodium borohydride in methanol to give the desired alcohol of formula V. The compounds of the formula I, wherein Y is OH, are acidic and they form base salts. All such bass salts are within the scope of this invention. They can be prepared by conventional methods for carboxylic acid compounds. For example, they can be prepared readily and conveniently simply by contacting the acidic and basic entities, usually in a stoichiometric ratio, in either an aqueous, non aqueous or partially aqueous medium, as appropriate. The salts are recovered either by filtration, by precipitation with a non solvent followed by filtration, by evaporation of the solvent, as appropriate, or, in the case of aqueous solutions, by lyophilization.Basic agents suitably employed in salt formation belong to both the organic and inorganic types, and they include ammonia, organic amines, alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal bicarbonates, alkali metal hydrides, alkali metal alkoxides, alkaline earth metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal carbonates, alkaline earth metal hydrides and alkaline earth metal alkoxides.Representative examples of such bases are amines, such as n butylamine, cyclohexylamine, benzylamine, p toluidine, octylamine, diethylamine, morpholine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, triethylamine, N ethylpiperidine, Nmethylmorpholine and 1,5 diazobicyclo 4.3.0lnon 5 ene hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide and potassium methoxide hydrides, such as calcium hydride and sodium hydride and carbonates, such as potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate. Additionally, the compounds of formula I, wherein X is NH or NICE3, are basic and they will form acid addition salts. All such acid addition salts are within the scope of this invention. They can be prepared by conventional methods for amine compounds.For example, they can be prepared by contacting said compound of formula I, wherein X is NH or NCE3, with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate acid in an appropriate solvent. The salt can then be recovered by filtration, by precipitation with a non solvent followed by filtration, or by evaporation of the solvent, as appropriate. Acid addition salts of compounds of formula I, wherein X is NH or NCH3, can be prepared from both inorganic and organic acids, and typical salts are the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acetate, maleate, fumarate, oxalate, lactate, tartrate, citrate, gluconate and 4 toluenesulfonate. However, as will be appreciated by one with skill in the art, whenever it is intended to use a salt of a compound of formula I for administration to a mammalian subject, it is necessary to use a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. As indicated hereinbefore, the compounds of formula I, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, have the ability to inhibit the degradation of cartilage when they are administered to a mammalian subject afflicted with an arthritic disease. For this purpose, said compounds of formula I, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can be administered to a mammalian subject either alone, or, preferably, in combination with pharmaceuticallyacceptable carriers or diluents, in a pharmaceutical composition, according to standard pharmaceutical practice. A compound can be administered orally or parenterally. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraarticular administration. In a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, the weight ratio of active ingredient to carrier will normally be in the range from 1 1,000 to 1 20, and preferably about 1 500. However, in any given case, the ratio chosen will depend on such factors as the solubility of the active component, the dosage contemplated and the precise route of administration. For oral use of a compound of this invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof of this invention, the compound can be administered, for example, in the form of tablets or capsules, or as an aqueous solution or suspension. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose and corn starch, and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are commonly added. For oral administration in capsule form, useful diluents are lactose and dried corn starch.When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and or flavoring agents can be added. For intramuscular, subcutaneous, intra articular and intravenous use, sterile solutions of the active ingredient are usually prepared, and the pE of the solutions should be suitably adjusted and buffered. For intravenous use, the total concentration of solutes should be controlled to render the preparation isotonic. When a compound of formula I or salt thereof is used to inhibit the degradation of cartilage in a human subject, the daily dosage will normally be determined by the prescribing physician. Moreover, the dosage will vary according to the age, weight and response of the individual patient, as well as the severity of the patient s symptoms. However, in most instances, an effective daily dosage will be in the range from about 0.05 mg to 1.0 mg, in single ar divided doses. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases. The following examples are provided solely for the purpose of further illustration. Infrared spectra were measured as potassium bromide discs, and diagnostic absorption bands are reported in reciprocal centimeters cm . Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra 1 NMR were measured in deuterochloroform CDC13 or perdeutero methanol CD30D , and peak positions are expressed in parts per million ppm downfield from internal tetramethylsilane.
