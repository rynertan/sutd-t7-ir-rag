# Low intensity X ray and gamma ray imaging spectrometer.

## Abstract
A low intensity X ray and gamma ray spectrometer 10 is disclosed for imaging, counting, and energy resolving of, single invisible radiation particles. Spectrometer 10 includes a converting device 20 for converting single invisible radia tion particles to visible light photons. Another converting device 24 converts the visible light photons to photoelec trons. A fiber optics coupling device 22 couples together converting devices 20 and 24. An intensifying device 26 intensifies the photoelectrons by an average gain factor of substantially 10⁴ 10⁷. Intensifying device 26 is an anti ion feedback microchannel plate amplifier which is operated substantially below saturation. A displaying device 32 dis plays the intensified photoelectrons. Displaying device 32 indicates the spatial position, number, and energy of the incoming single invisible radiation particles.
