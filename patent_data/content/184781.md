## Description
REAR BETRANC SI OOT WITH DIFFERENTIATED CLOSURE This invention relates to a rear entrance ski boot with differentiated closure. As is known, rear entrance ski boots comprise substantially a shell whereon a front quarter and a rear quarter are journallea which, to close the boot, are held together by means of one or more levers which serve in practice a dual function. A first is that of connecting fixedly together the front and rear quarters, and a second is that of fastening the quarters to each other so as to constrain the skier s leg as desired within the boot and secure the leg with respect to the quarters. This approach, even if universally adopted, has some disadvantages, a first of which is that considerable problems are encountered with the positioning of the levers on the boot, which must have a certain length in order to apply a desired clamping force and at the same time, should not protrude excessively from the boot, because they could be released incidentally in the event of impacts or the like. Another disadvantage of the above approach is that, since the two actions cannot be split, that is the action of connecting the quarters together and the constraint action on the leg, it is necessary to apply relatively large forces which, in some cases, may make operating the levers difficult. It is the aim of this invention to obviate such prior disadvantages by providing a rear entrance ski boot affording the possibility of closing the quarters independently against each other and constraining the leg with respect to the quarters, thus rendering the boot closing operation both easy and quick to complete. Within the above aim, it is a particular object of the invention to provide a ski boot which has no outward protruding levers which, besides detracting from the boat s appearance, create considerable problems as regards their manufacture, for the reasons set forth above. Another object of this invention is to provide a ski boot which affords a constraining action on the leg in between the quarters, without by so doing generating large loads or uncomfortable constraints for the user. A not least object of the invention is to provide a ski boot which affords reciprocal opening of the quarters, so as to greatly facilitate putting the boots on. The above aim, and these and other objects to become apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a rear entrance ski boot with differentiated closure, according to the invention, comprising a shell whereon front and rear quarters are journalled, characterized in that the boot closure means comprise mutual connection means for detachably connecting said front and rear quarters together, and locking means operable independently of said connection means and acting in the area delimited by said quarters to constrain the skier s leg. Further features and advantages will be apparent from the description of a preferred but not exclusive embodiment of a rear entrance ski boot, as shown by way of illustration and not of limitation in the accompanying drawings, where Figure 1 shows diagramatically a ski boot according to the invention in its closed position Figure 2 shows the ski boot in its open position Figure 3 shows diagramatically a detail of the mutual connection means as coupled together Figure 4 shows the mutual connection means separate from one another Figure 5 is a sectional view of the boot showing the locking means Figure 6 is a sectional view of the boot showing the locking means during the leg constraining phase Figure 7 is an exploded perspective view of the locking means and Figure 8 is a perspective view of the locking means as constraining is being performed. With reference to the drawing figures, a rear entrance ski boot according to the invention comprises a shell 1, of known configuration, whereon there are journalled a front quarter 2 and a rear quarter 3, also of conventional configuration. The invention is peculiar in that the boot closure means have no levers protruding externally from the boot but include means of mutual connection which allow the rear quarter 3 to be engaged releasably with the front quarter 2. In detail, the connection means comprise a pushbutton element 10 defined on a small ear 11 provided on the sides of the rear quarter and being movable elastically. The pushbutton element 10 is preferably a unitary construction with the ears 11 and is received in a small window 12 whereto it is connected at the front side. On the rear edge, the pushbutton element 10 has an abutment detent 15. The ears 11 with the respective pushbutton elements 10 are removably accouddattle in a seat 20 defined at the edge of the front quarter 2, and having a window wherein the pushbutton element 10 is accommodated removably which on surfacing through the window 21 in the seat, brings its abutment detent to engage with the rear edge 23 of the seat, thus preventing the ear 11 from incidentally disengaging itself from the seat 20. To effect the opening, it will be sufficient to apply a pressure to the pushbutton element, so as to disengage the abutment detent from the rear edge of the window, thereby allowing the ears to bye removed from the seats which are provided, correspondingly with the ears, on either sides of the front quarter. Thus, coupling of the connection means provides for uniting the rear quarter with the front quarter without, however, providing of necessity constraint on the skier s leg, also on account of the fact that the skier s leg may have different anatomical dimensions, so that the coupling accomplished in the manner just described for the rear and front quarters applies no constraint to the leg. To close the boot, together with the connection means described above, there are provided locking means, which are operable independently of the connection means and serve the function of costraining the skier s leg in the area delimited by the quarters. Such locking means, which may be of a mechanical or the like nature, are preferably, but not necessarily, formed of an air bladder 30 carried on the rear quarter 3 and in communication with pump means, of a type known per se, which are not shown in the drawing. Advantageously, on the side confronting the leg, there is provided a rigid presser 31 which has the function of better distributing the pressure on the leg. Furthermore, it should be said that advantageousl7 the air bladder 30 has partitions, provided by welded seam lines 33, which afford a differentiated action of the pressure applicable by the air bladder. The boot closure described above is operated by merely uniting the front quarter first with the rear quarter, utilizing the pushbutton element 10 which enters the seat 20 locking itself releasably then, to constrain the leg, it will be sufficient to introduce air or fluid under pressure into the air bladder 30, so as to exert the sought constraint action on the leg inside the quarters, with an action which is applicable independently of the union of the quarters together, contrary to what occurs in the prior art which, to accomplish the quarter closure, performs simultaneously the union and mutual fastening of the quarters to each other and on the skier s leg. From the foregoing description it may be appreciated that the invention achieves its objects, and in particular that a boot is provided wherein the closure can be effected without outer levers in a convenient and quick manner without great closure efforts being required. The invention herein is susceptible to many modifications and variations without departing from the scope of the inventive concept. Furthermore, all of the details may be replaced with technical equivalents thereof. In practicing the invention, the materials used, and the dimensions and contingent shapes, may be any appropriate ones.
