# An apparatus for installing a disk.

## Abstract
An apparatus for installing a disk 1 having a through hole 2 formed in the center thereof, which comprises a rotatable shaft 10 , a disk support 13 which is fixed to the rotatable shaft 10 and has a supporting surface 13a for supporting the one side of the disk 1 , and a disk holder 14 which is detachably fitted to the rotatable shaft 10 and presses the disk 1 on its other side toward the supporting surface 13a , thereby to cause the disk 1 to be fixed between the disk holder 14 and the disk support 13 . The disk holder 14 includes a holder body 15 which is provided to be fitted onto the rotatable shaft 10 and movable along the rotatable shaft 10 , a pressure assembly 16 which is disposed on the holder body 15 to exert the disk 1 on its other side an elastic pressure against the supporting surface 13a , and a slip preventive mechanism 21 for preventing the holder body 15 from the rotatable shaft 10 by engaging the holder body 15 with the rotatable shaft 10 through the fitting of the holder body 15 onto the rotatable shaft.
