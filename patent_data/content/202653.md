# DISPERSIBLE TABLET AND GRANULATION PRODUCT AND METHOD OF FORMULATION OF SAME

## Abstract
An improved dispersable tablet and granulation product for water treatment. A water soluble material act as a matrix for one or more water soluble dry active water treating agents which are intimately mixed with the matrix material. The matrix material is more water soluble than the water treating agent and provides for rapid dispersing of the water treating agent. In one embodiment, the matrix is formed from a polymeric material and in another form a water treating agent. Also, the polymeric material may be initially treating with an alcohol, then blended with the water treating agent and thereafter water is added to the admixed polymeric mate rial and water treating agent to bond the polymeric molecules together and entrap the water treating agent in the polymeric matrix.
