# Slot transfer molding means and methods.

## Abstract
An improved means and method is provided for encap sulating electronic devices 30 and other objects by transfer molding. The mold cavities 22 are arranged in rows, disposed adjacent to and parallel with slot shaped encapsu lant reservoirs 24 , and coupled to the reservoirs by short feeder channels 25 of uniform length. Preferably, a row of cavities 22 is located in a mirror symmetric fashion on either side of and parallel with each slot shaped reservoir 24 . A tightly fitting blade 23 moves in each slot shaped reservoir 24 to compress and liquify the plastic encapsulant charge, injecting it into the mold cavities 22 containing the component 30 to be encapsulated. Plastic utilization can exceed 90 , and better control over molding conditions can be obtained because the plastic material reaches each mold cavity at the same stage of the liquification solidification cycle. More cavities can be fitted in a given mold area because the usual central material pot 15 and runner tree 14 are eliminated.
