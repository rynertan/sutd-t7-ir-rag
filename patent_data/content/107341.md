# Fuel gas analyzing apparatus.

## Abstract
The apparatus includes a rotary mixing valve 8 producing a mixture of fuel gas 2 and air 10 in any one of a plurality of different ratios, a burner 222 producing a combustion of the mixture, a sensor 24 sensing the combustion products to provide an output signal on line 25 representative of the state of combustion, and a controller 28 operable in response to the output signal to control the valve 8 to obtain a first substantially stoichiometric combustion and a second substantially stoichiometric combustion upon the introduction of additional air to the mixture, the calorific content of the fuel gas being determined from the measured control of the first and second combustions.
