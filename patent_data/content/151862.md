# Improvements in baby feed bottles.

## Abstract
The invention provides a baby feed bottle and combina tion thereof with a screw fitting annular cap to which a teat, preferably moulded of liquid silicone rubber may be assem bled before the cap is fitted to the bottle. The bottle is dimensioned with a large capacity per cm height, giving it an unusually large diameter, and the externally threaded neck 12 in particularly wide mouthed as it also has a large diameter of the order of three quarters the diameter of the main portion 10 of the bottle. The teat is moulded with shape and dimensions such that, when the annular cap teat sub assembly is fitted to the bottle and screwed down, a flap valve arrangement is produced by a depending lip 35 on the teat which seals against the interior of the bottle neck. The flap valve arrangement is operative when the bottle is used to prevent collapse of the teat mouthpiece.
