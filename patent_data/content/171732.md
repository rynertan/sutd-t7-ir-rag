# Thickness control method and system for a single stand multi pass rolling mill.

## Abstract
In a method and system for controlling a final thickness of a strip material being rolled in a single stand multi pass rolling mill having an adjustable main parameter affecting the final thickness and one or more auxiliary parameters affecting an intermediate thickness, the reference value of the main parameter is corrected in accordance with the deviation of the final thickness from its reference value and a reference value of at least one of the auxiliary parameters is corrected to cancel the effect of the correction to the main parameter on the intermediate thickness.
