# Air conditioning economizer control method and apparatus.

## Abstract
An air conditioning economizer control method and apparatus for integrating the operation of the economizer 40 with an air conditioning system is disclosed. An economizer position control arrangement is further dis closed incorporating a rotor locking circuit RLC for main taining the damper 43 in position against a bias applied by mechanical means such as a spring 90 . A multiple position indicator SW 1, SW 2 or multiple temperature sensor MAT 1, MAT 2 is utilized to modulate the position of the damper utilizing the motor for opening the damper, a spring for returning the damper and a rotor locking circuit for maintaining the damper in position. Multiple temperature sensors OAT, CLS are also disclosed for making effective use of outdoor air when cooling through economizer opera tion is available. Staged cooling loads relative to outdoor ambient temperatures are utilized to select the appropriate mode of operation.
