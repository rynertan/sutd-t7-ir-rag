# Polyolefin layer with improved adhesion to a plastic substrate.

## Abstract
A rotational molding process for manufacturing objects having a foamed plastic substrate adhered to an outer polyolefin coating layer, and having improved adhesion therebetween comprising the combination of steps of preparing a first outer coating layer of a stabilized polyolefin forming a second inner layer of an at most slightly stabilized polyolefin contiguous with and on the interior surface of said first outer layer and thereafter introducing a foamable plastic material onto the interior surface of said second layer and foaming said plastic material thereagainst thereby the foamed plastic is bonded to said second interior surface.
