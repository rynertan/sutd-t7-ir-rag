High frequency wave guide or high frequency filter for frequencies in the VHF, UHF and microwave frequency bands comprising at least one resonator. Each resonator comprises a conductive housing 20 , an inner conductor 21 , one end of which is fixed at the bottom of the housing and the other end of which is free standing, and a cylindrical dielectric body 22 surrounding said inner conductor, the diameter of the dielectric body being approximately four times as large as that of said conductor.
