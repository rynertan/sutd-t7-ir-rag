The use of certain cyclohexane l,3 dione derivatives as grass herbicides is known in the art. For example, the Pesticide Manual C R Worthing Editor,The British Crop Protection Council, 6th Edition 1979 describes the cyclohexane 1 3 dione derivative known commercially as alloxydim sodium methyl 3 C1 allyloxyimino butylJ 4 hydroxy 6,6 dimethyl 2 oxo cyclohex 3 ene carboxylate and its use as a grass herbicide. This compound is disclosed in AustralianPatent No 464 655 and its equivalents such as UK PatentNo 1 461 170 and US Patent No 3 950 420. More recently, at the 1980 British CropProtection Conference 1980 British Crop ProtectionConference Weeds, Proceedings Vol 1 ResearchReports, pp 39 to 46, British Crop Protection Council, 1980 , a new cyclohexane 1,3 dione grass herbicide code named NP 55 2 N ethoxybutrimidoyl 5 2 ethyl thiopropyl 3 hydroxy 2 cyclohexen 1 one was announced. This compound is disclosed in AustralianPatent No 503 917 and its equivalents. It is also known from US Patent 4,033,754 that it is possible to prepare herbicidal ester dimers of certain cyclohexane 1,3 diones herbicides.

The structures of the compounds described above are detailed on the following pages.

Generally speaking the compounds of formula I are herbicidally effective against monocotyledonous plants, dicotyledonous plants being relatively unaffected by rates of application of the compounds of the invention which are severely damaging or lethal to other plant species. Moreover, certain of the compounds of formula I are selectively active within the group of monocotyledonous plants and may be used at a rate sufficient to control monocotyledonous weeds in cultivated crops especially wild grasses in cereal crops. Accordingly in yet a further aspect the invention provides a process for controlling monocotyledonous weeds in cultivated crops, especially wild grasses in broad leaf crops which process comprises applying to the crop, or to the growth medium of the crop, a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined, in an amount sufficient to severely damage or kill the weeds but insufficient to damage the crop substantially. The compounds of formula I may be applied directly to the plant post emergence application or to the soil before the emergence of the plant preemergence application . However, the compounds are in general more effective when applied to the plant post emergence. The compounds of formula I may be used on their own to inhibit the growth of, severely damage, or kill plants but are preferably used in the form of a composition comprising a compound of the invention in admixture with a carrier comprising a solid or liquid diluent. Therefore in yet a further aspect the invention provides growth inhibiting plant damaging, or plant killing compositions comprising a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined and an inert carrier therefor. Certain of the compounds of formula I exhibit useful plant growth regulating activity. For example, while compounds of formula I are selectively active herbicides against wild grasses in crops of cultivated plants at some rates of application they exhibit plant growth regulating effects in said crops. Plant growth regulating effects may be manifested in a number of ways. For example raising the sugar content of plants, suppression of apical dominance, stimulation of auxiliary bud growth stimulation of early flowering and seed formation, enhancement of flowering and increase in seed yield, stem thickening stem shortening and tillering. Plant growth regulating effects shown in compounds of the invention may include for example, tillering and stem shortening in crops such as wheat and barley, and increasing the sugar content of sugar cane. Accordingly in a still further aspect the invention provides a process for regulating the growth of a plant which process comprises applying to the plant, to the seed of the plant, or to the growth medium of the plant, an effective amount of a compound of formula I, as hereinbefore defined. To effect the plant growth regulating process of the present invention the compounds of formula I may be applied directly to the plant post emergence application or to the seed or soil before the emergence of the plant pre emergence application. The compounds of formula I may be used on their own to regulate the growth of plants but in general are preferably used in the form of a composition comprising a compound of the invention in admixture with a carrier comprising a solid or liquid diluent. Therefore, in a still further aspect the invention provides plant growth regulating compositions comprising a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined and an inert carrier therefor. The compositions of the present invention may be in the form of solids, liquids or pastes. The compositions include both dilute compositions which are ready for immediate use and concentrated compositions which may require dilution before use. Therefore, the concentration of the active ingredient in the compositions of the present invention will vary depending on the types of formulation and whether the composition is ready for use such as, for example, a dust formulation or an aqueous emulsion or whether the composition is a concentrate such as for example, an emulsifiable concentrate or a wettable powder, which is suitable for dilution before use. In general the compositions of the present invention comprise from 1 ppm to 998 by weight of active ingredient. The solid compositions may be in the form of powders, dusts pellets grains and granules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with a solid diluent.Powders and dusts may be prepared by mixing or grinding the active ingredient with a solid carrier to give a finely divided composition. Granules grains and pellets may be prepared by bonding the active ingredient to a solid carrier, for example, by coating or impregnating the preformed granular solid carrier with the active ingredient or by agglomeration techniques. Examples of solid carriers include mineral earths and clays such as for example kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, Fuller s earth, Attaclay dtatomaceous earth bole loess talc chalk dolomite, limestone, lime calcium carbonate gypsum, calcium sulfate, pyrophyllite, silicic acid silicates and silica gels fertilizers such as for example ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate ammonium nitrate and urea natural products of vegetable origin such as for example, grain meals and flours, bark meals, wood meals, nutshell meals and cellulosic powders and synthetic polymeric materials such as, for example, ground or powdered plastics and resins. Alternatively, the solid compositions may be in the form of dispersible or wettable dusts powders granules or grains wherein the active ingredient and the solid carrier are combined with one or more surface active agents which act as wetting, emulsifying and or dispersing agents to facilitate the dispersion of the active ingredient in liquid. Examples of surface active agents include those of the cationic, anionic and non ionic type.

It should be noted that the compounds of the invention of formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen are acidic. Therefore, the compounds of formula I may be formulated and applied as the salts of organic or inorganic bases. In formulating and employing the compounds of formula I in the form of their salts either the salts per se, that is the compounde of formula I wherein R1 is an inorganic or an organic cation may be used in the formulation or the compounds of formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen may be used in the formulation and the salts generated in situ by the use of the appropriate organic or inorganic base. The mode of application of the compositions of the invention will depend to a large extent on the type of composition used and the facilities available for its application. Solid compositions may be applied by dusting or any other suitable means for broadcasting or spreading the solid. Liquid compositions may be applied by spraying, atomizing, watering introduction into the irrigation water, or any other suitable means for broadcasting or spreading the liquid. The rate of application of the compounds of the invention will depend on a number of factors including, for example, the compound chosen for use the identity of the plants whose growth is to be inhibited the formulations selected for use and whether the compound is to be applied for foliage or root uptake. As a general guide, however, an application rate of from 0.005 to 20 kilograms per hectate is suitable while from 0.01 to 5.0 kilograms per hectare may be preferred. The compositions of the invention may comprise, in addition to one or more compounds of the invention, one or more compounds not of the invention but which possess biological activity. For example as hereinbefore indicated the compounds of the invention are in general substantially more effective against monocotyledonous plants or grass species than against dicotyledonous plants or broad leaved species. As a result, in certain applications the herbicidal use of the compounds of the invention alone may not be sufficient to protect a crop. Accordingly in yet a still further embodiment the invention provides a herbicidal composition comprising a mixture of at least one herbicidal compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined with at least one other herbicide. The other herbicide may be any herbicide not having the formula I. It will generally be a herbicide having a complementary action.

Span 80 is a Trade Mark for a surface active agent comprising sorbitan monolaurate. Tween 20 is aTrade mark for a surface active agent comprising a condensate of sorbitan monolaurate with 20 molar proportions of ethylene oxide. Each 5 ml emulsion containing a test compound was then diluted to 40 ml with water and sprayed on to young pot plants postemergence test of the species named in Table 5 below.Damage to test plants was assessed after 14 days on a scale of O to 5 where 0 is O to 20 damage and 5 is complete kill. The degree of herbicidal damage was assessed by comparison with untreated control plants. The results are given in Table 5 below. A dash means that no experiment was carried out.
