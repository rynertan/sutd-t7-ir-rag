## Description
CHEMICALLY SENSITIVE PET COMPONENT Background of the Invention The invention relates to a chemically sensitive PET component and, more particularly, to an improved component for reducing adverse affects of leakage current. A field effect transistor FET sensitive to ions or molecular substances is a device finding rapidly increasing employment in measuring systems for, for example, determining the concentration of a particular type of ion in a liquid and monitoring changes in the concentration of this type of ion. A chemically sensitive field effect transistor PET component is based on a MOSFET, sometimes known as anIGFET, having an insulated gate. The metal gate of the MOSPET is replaced by an electrically insulating layer, such as silicon dioxide. A prior art example is set forth in the U.S. Patent to C. Johnson et al., 4,020,830. Such an ion selective field effect transistor ISFET can be used, for example, for in vivo measurement of the pH of blood when mounted in a catheter adapted for insertion into the human bloodstream and connected as a sensor in an appropriate electrical measuring circuit, additionally including a reference electrode. Such use of the ISFET implies that the elements of the ISFET chip playing an active part in the measurement are to be exposed to the electrolyte. The remainder of the chip, however, should be hermetically sealed against electrical contact with the electrolyte and should accordingly be provided with an enclosure.The manufacture of a hundred percent electrically insulating enclosure presents a technical problem, especially when mass fabricating sensors which, in a miniature housing, are to remain for a long period of time in the liquid to be measured and which should satisfy high demands as to accuracy. One of the reasons for this is that the ISFET sensor itself has very small dimensions of about 1 x 2 mm, while the gate region within which the chemically selective coating is located is of even smaller dimensions, i.e., about 20 x 400 um.Practice has shown that the liquid to be measured will eventually penetrate to the ISFET sensor chip, resulting in a leakage current flowing via the reference electrode to the bulk, source or drain of the ISFET chip. In general, the intensity of this leakage current will increase with time. Due to the relatively high impe ance of most reference electrodes 10 to 20 ohm , the leakage current contributes to the electrochemical potential difference between the reference electrode and the chemically selective surface coating of the ISFET. As the measuring system is unable to distinguish such a contribution from a measuring signal caused by a change in the chemical composition of the liquid to be measured, the leakage current has a detrimental effect on the accuracy of the ISFET measuring system.Consequently, the problem of the occurrence of measuring errors caused by an ineffective enclosure is really an insulation problem. The prior art relating to ISFET components includes theBritish Application to K. Shimada et al., GB 2 010 011 A, published on June 20, 1979 which provides a double layer structure including a silicon dioxide layer covering the whole chip except for the side where the bonding pads are situated as, for example, is shown in Fig. 5J and Fig. 5K.This layer is overlaid with a second electrical insulating layer of silicon nitride. This represents an improvement in insulating properties over the ISFET disclosed in theJohnson patent, supra. However, such a double insulation layer is believed complicated to manufacture. Summary of the Invention Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a chemically sensitive PET component having enhanced electrical insulation achieved in a manner suitable for inclusion in the manufacturing procedure ofPET components and of chemically sensitive sensors and measuring systems employing such PET components. To achieve this object, in accordance with the invention a chemically sensitive PET component of the type described above is characterized in that the source and the drain are located in an island provided on and or in the substrate, which island is of the semiconductor material but doped with a type of impurity opposite to that with which the substrate is doped to thereby define aPN insulation junction therebetween. Brief Description of the Drawings The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figures la and lb schematically show a cross sectional view of an ISFET component on the basis of a p type impurity doped silicon substrate and a diagram of the circuit arrangement to be realized in practice on the basis of such an ISFET component, respectively Figures 2a and 2b schematically show a cross sectional view of an ISFET component on the basis of an n type impurity doped silicon substrate and a diagram of the circuit arrangement to be realized on the basis of such anISFET component, respectively Figure 3 is a top view of the component in Figure la Fig. 4 is a sectional view taken generally along line 4 4 in Figure 3 looking in the direction of the arrows and, Fig. 5 is a sectional view taken generally along line 5 5 in Figure 3 looking in the direction of the arrows. Description of Preferred Embodiment For convenience, the invention will be described with reference to Figures 1 and 3 5. A similar description applies to Figure 2 except for the fact that in thisFigure 2 the polarities of the silicon semiconductor material are opposite to those according to Figure 1. In Figure la the ISFET component 1 comprises the substrate 2 of p silicon including an island 6 of n silicon having its side walls 3 coated with p silicon.Regions 14 and 15 in island 6 are the p source and the p drain, respectively, formed by diffusion. The ISFET component has its, in the drawing, upper side provided with an electrically insulating layer 7 of silicon dioxide. A chemically selective coating, for example, a pH sensitive membrane, is provided in the gate region 8 in a manner not shown in the drawings. Furthermore, theISFET 1 is provided in the usual manner with an enclosure, not shown, of electrically insulating material exposing only the gate region for allowing the chemically selective membrane to contact the liquid, such as blood, to be examined. As seen in Figures 3 5, the component 1 is an elongated rectangular shaped structure. As seen in Figure 3, the source and drain regions are elongated L shaped regions having their short legs facing each other and spaced apart to define the gate region 8 therebetween.The other ends of the regions 14 and 15 are each electrically connected with a metal bonding pad for wire connections externally of the component. As shown in Figure lb, the measuring circuit comprises a reference electrode 5 expediently being an Ag AgCl electrode, which reference electrode is placed in the liquid under examination together with the ISFET. When using the ISFET component shown in Figure la, the voltage of reference electrode 5 should be negative with respect to that of source 14 as shown in the diagram of Figure lb. In the case of the ISFET component shown in Figure 2, in which the polarities of the silicon used in substrate 2 , island 6 , source 16 and drain 17 are opposite to those of the ISFET component shown in Figure 1, the voltage of reference electrode 5 should accordingly be positive with repect to that of source 16. The operating point of the reference electrode is so chosen within the measuring system that electrical current occurring thereat has to pass a reverse biased p n junction. In general, the leakage currents which may occur will have very low intensity on the order of nA and such leakage currents are now limited by the blocked p n junction. This blocking is achieved by the PN insulation junction between the island 6 and the substrate 2.. Additional blocking is achieved by the PN insulation junction between the island and the impurity doped side walls 3. Consequently, the maximum leakage current traversing the measuring system is no longer determined by the quality of the insulation of the enclosure. Leakage currents through the insulation are now of consideration only when such currents can flow to the lead wires on the chip owing to the presence of liquid on the insulation.As this leakage path will, in general, be far longer than the original path to the bulk of the chip, use of the same encapsulation results in a far longer service life of the sensor. The islands 6, 6 of silicon doped with a type of impurity opposite to that with which the silicon substrate is doped can be obtained in various manners. One possible method is to provide the island by diffusion or by implantation, after which the source and drain regions are provided in the island by diffusion. In accordance with another possible method, one can start from n on p or p on n epitaxial wafers and realize the insulation according to the invention by separation diffusions resulting in the formation of separated regions in which the ISFET component can be placed. Furthermore, it is also possible, again starting from the n on p or p on n epitaxial wafers, to provide slots therein which intersect the epitaxial layer and to subsequently insulate the side walls of the thus mechanically separated islands by coating these walls with an electricaly insulating material and or by diffusing into these walls a dopant of opposite impurity type. The on chip insulation renders the method of enclosing the extremely small ISFET component less critical. The provision of the insulation itself can conveniently be realized in charge wise manner through on wafer technology, the junction insulation resulting, moreover, in a longer service life and improved stability of the reference electrode Self evidently, changes may be made in the chemically sensitive FET component described above and shown in the drawings without departing from the scope of the invention
