## Description
FUNGICIDAL N PHENYLCARBAMATES This invention relates to fungicidal N phenylcarbamates. Benzimidazole and thiophanate fungicides such asBenomyl methyl l butylcarbamoyl benzimidazol 2 ylcarba mate , Fubelidazol 2 2 furyl benzimidazole , Thiabendazole 2 4 thiazolyl benzimidazole , Carbendazim methyl benzimidazol 2 ylcarbamate , Thiophanate methyl 1, 2 bis 3 methoxycarbonyl 2 thioureido benzene , Thiophanate 1,2 bis 3 ethoxycarbonyl 2 thioureido benzene , 2 O,S dimethyl phosphorylamino l 3 methoxycarbonyl 2 thioureido benzene and 2 O,O dimethylthiophosphorylamino 1 3 methOxy carbonyl 2 thioureido benzene are known to show an excellent fungicidal activity against various plant pathogenic fungi, and they have been widely used as agricultural fungicides since 1970.However, their continuous application over a long period of time provides phytopathogenic fungi with tolerance to them, whereby their plant diseasepreventive effect is lowered. Further, the fungi which have gained tolerance to certain kinds of benzimidaz vle or third phanate fungicides also show considerable tolerance to some other kinds of benzimidazole or thiophanate tungicides. Thus, they are apt to acquire a cross tolerance. Therefore,if any sigriificantdecrease of their plant digease preventive effect in certain fields is observed, their application such fields has to be discontinued. However, it is often observed that the density of drug resistant organisms does not decrease even long after the discontinuation of the use. Although other kinds of fungicides have to be employed in sudi cases, only a few are as effective as benzimidazole or thiophanate fungicides in controlling various phytopathogenic fungi. Cyclic imide fungicides such asProcymidone 3 3 ,5 dichlorophenyl 1,2 dimethylcyclo propane 1,2 icarboximide , Iprodione 3 3 ,5 dichlorophenyl l isopropylcarbamoylimidazolidine 2,4 dione ,Vinchlozolin 3 3 ,5 dichlorophenyl 5 methyl 5 vinyloxazolidine 2,4 dione , ethyl RS 3 3 ,5 dichlorophenyl 5 methyl 2,4 dioxooxazolidine 5 carboxylate, etc., which are effective against various plant diseases, particularly those caused by Botrytis cinerea, have the same defects as previously explained with respect to the benzimidazole and thicphanate fungicides. In C.R. Acad. Sc. Paris, t. 289, S erie D, pages 691 693 1979 , it is described that such herbicides asBarban 4 chloro 2 butynyl N 3 chlorophenyl carbamate , Chlorobufam l methyl 2 propynyl N 3 chlorophenyl carbamate , Chlorpropham isppropyl N 3 chlorophenyl carbamate and Propham isopropyl N phenylcarbamate exhibit a fungicidal activity against certain organisms which show a tolerance to some.benzimidazole and thicphanate fungicides. However, their fungicidal activity against the drug resistant fungi is not very strong, and hence, in practice they can not be used as fungicides. We have now found that N phenylcarbamates of the formula EMI3.1 wherein X and Y are the same or different and each represent a halogen atan, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkenyl group, a lower cyanoalkenyl group, a lower alkynyl group, a lower alkoxy group, a cyano group, a lower alkyl group substituted with at least one halogen atcm, hydroxyl or cyano group, or a group of the formula EMI3.2 EMI3.3 in which R3is a lower alkyl group, a lower alkenyl group, a lower alkynyl group or a lower haloalkyl group, R4 5 and R are the same or different and each represent a lower alkyl group, R6 is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group and n is 2, 3 or 4 Z is a hydrogen atom, a fluorine atom or a group of the formula OR7 in which R7 is a lower alkyl group, a lower alkenyl group, a lower alkynyl group or a lower alkyl group substituted with at least one halogen atom, lower alkoxy of lower cycloalkyl group A is an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom R1 is a C1 C8 alkyl group, a C3 C8 alkenyl group, a C C alkynyl group, a lower cycloalkyl group, a lower haloalkenyl group, a lower haloalkynyl group or a lower alkyl group substituted with at least one halogen atom, cyano, lower alkoxy, lower alkenyloxy, lower haloalkoxy, phenoxy, lower aralkyloxy, phenyl or lower cycloalkyl group and R2 is a hydrogen atom, a cyano group, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkenyl group, a lower alkynyl group, a lower cycloalkyl group, a lower haloalkenyl group, a lower alkyl group substituted with at least one halogen atom, cyano, lower alkoxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl, lower alkylcarbonyl, phenoxycarbonyl the phenoxy group optionally being substituted with at least one halogen atom, cyano, nitro, trifluoromethyl, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy group , lower cycloalkyl, phenoxy the phenoxy group optionally being substituted with at least one halogen atom and or at least one alkyl group or heteroaryl group the heteroaryl group optionally being substituted with at least one halogen atom and or at least one alkyl group , a phenyl group, a phenyl group substituted with at least one halogen atom, cyano, nitro, trifluoromethyl, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy group, an aralkyl group the aralkyl group optionally being substituted with at least one halogen atom and or at least one alkyl group or a group of the formula COR8 or Si R9 3 in which R8 is a lower alkyl group, a lower alkenyl group, a lower alkynyl group, a lower cycloalkyl group, a lower haloalkenyl group, a lower alkyl group substituted with at least one halogen atom, cyano, lower alkoxy, lower cycloalkyl or phenoxy group the phenoxy group optionally being substituted with at least one halogen atom and or at least one alkyl group , a phenyl group, a phenyl group substituted with at least one halogen atom, cyano, nitro,.trifluoromethyl, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy group, or an aralkyl group the aralkyl group optionally being substituted with at least one halogen atom and or at least one alkyl group and R9 is a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxy group, a halogen atom or a group of the formula SR10 in which R10 is a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxycarbonyl group or a phenyl group the phenyl group optionally being substituted with at least one halogen atom, cyano, nitro, trifluoromethyl, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy group , show an excellent fungicidal activity against plant pathogenic fungi which have developed resistance to benzimidazole, thiophanate and or cyclic imide fungicides. It is notable that their fungicidal potency against the organisms tolerant to benzimidazole, thiophanate and or cyclic imide fungicides hereinafter referred to as drug resistant fungi or drug resistant strains is much higher than that against organisms sensitive to benzimidazole, thiophanate and or cyclic imide fungicides hereinafter referred to as drug sensitive fungi or drug sensitive strains . By the term lower used herein in connection with organic radicals or compounds is meant that such radicals or compounds each have not more than 6 carbon atoms. Likewise, by the term heteroaryl used herein in connection with organic radicals or compounds is meant 5 membered heterocycles, condensed 5 membered heterocycles or 6 membered heterocycles such as furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, 1,2,3triazolyl, 1,2,4 triazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, benzofuranyl, benzothienyl, indolyl, benzimidazolyl, indazolyl, benzoxazolyl, 1,2 benzisoxazolyl, benzotiazolyl, pyridinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl and pyrazinyl.By the term halogen used herein is meant fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. Thus, the present invention provides a fungicidal composition which comprises, as an active ingredient, a fungicidally effective amount of the N phenylcarbamate I together with an inert carrier or diluent. It also provides a b nation composition comprising as active ingredients theN phenylcarbamate I together with a benzimidazole, thio phanate and or a cyclic imide fungicide, which is fungicidally effective against not only drug sensitive fungi but also drug resistant fungi, and hence particularly effective tor the prevention of plant diseases. It also provides a method of controlling plant pathogenic fungi including drug resistant strains and drug sensitive strains by applying a fungicidally effective amount of the N phenylcarbamate I to plant pathogenic fungi.It further provides novel N phenylcarbamates which are represented by the formula I wherein X, Y, Z, A, R1 and R2 are each as defined above, with the provisos that when X is a chlorine atom, Z and R2 are each a hydrogen atom, A is an oxygen atom and R1 is an ethyl group, Y can not be a chlorine atom, a methyl group or a methoxy group and that when Z and R2 are each a hydrogen atom, A is an oxygen atom and R1 is an ethyl group, X and Y can not be simultaneously a methyl group or a methoxy group.

Such formulation form can be prepared in a conventional manner by mixing at least one of the N phenylcarbamates I with an appropriate solid or liquid carrier s or diluent s and, if necessary, an appropriate adjuvant s e.g. surfactants, adherents, dispersants, stabilizers for improving the dispersibility and other properties of the active ingredient s . Examples of the solid carriers or diluents are botanical materials e.g. flour, tobacco stalk powder, soybean powder, walnut shell powder, vegetable powder, saw dust, bran, bark powder, cellulose powder, vegetable extract residue , fibrous materials e.g. paper, corrugated cardboard, old rags , synthetic plastic powders, clays e.g.kaolin, bentonite, fuller s earth , talcs, other inorganic materials e.g. pyrophyllite, sericite, pumice, sulfur powder, active carbon and chemical fertilizers e.g.ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, urea, ammonium chloride3. Examples of the liquid carriers or diluents are water, alcohols e.g. methanol, ethanol , ketones e.g.acetone, methylethylketone , ethers e.g. diethyl ether, dioxane, cellosolve, tetrahydrofuran , aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene, methyl naphthalene , aliphatic hydrocarbons e.g. gasoline, kerosene, lamp oil , esters, nitriles, acid amides e.g. dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide , halogenated hydrocarbons e.g. dichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride , etc. Examples of the surfactants are alkyl sulfuric esters, alkyl sulfonates, alkylaryl sulfonates, polyethylene glycol ethers, polyhydric alcohol esters, etc. Examples of the adherents and dispersants may include cesein, gelatin, starch powder, carboxymethyl cellulose, gum arabic, alginic acid, lignin, bentonite, molasses, polyvinyl alcohol, pine oil and agar. As the stabilizers, there may be used PAP isopropyl acid phosphate mixture , tricresyl phosphate TCP , tolu oil, epoxydized oil, various surfactants, verious fatty acids and their esters, etc. The foregoing formulations generally contain at least one of the N phenylcarbamates I in a concentration of about 1 to 95 by weight, preferably of 2.0 to 80 by weight. By using the formulations, the N phenylcarbamates I are generally applied in such amounts as 2 to 100 g per 10 are. When only the drug resistant strains of phytopathogenic fungi are present, the N phenylcarbamates I may be used alone. However, when the drug sensitive strains are present together with the drug resistant strains, their alternate use with benzimidazole,thiophanate and or cyclic imide fungicides or their combined use with benzimidazole,thiophanate and or cyclic imide fungicides is favorable. In such alternate or combined use, each active ingredient may be employed as such or in conventional agricultural formulation forms. In case of the combined use, the weight proportion of the N phenylcarbamate I and the benzimidazole thiophanate and or the cyclic imide fungicide may be from about 1 0.1 to 1 10.0.
