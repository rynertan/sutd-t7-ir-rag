# Method for closing off an open end of a multilayered tube and a multilayered parison structure.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for sealing or closing off the open end of a multilayered tubular structure, especially one having a barrier or low gas permeable layer 12 , whereby the integrity of said barrier layer 12 is maintained. The method gives rise to a multilayered parison structure which comprises a cylindrical body having a body wall, an open portion terminating at one end thereof and a bottom wall at the opposite end of said body, said body and bottom walls being composed of a plurality of layers bonded together, all the layers of said bottom wall extending fully inwardly in contacting and overlapping relationship with like layers along the longitudinal axis of said cylindrical body, and a balancing member attached to said bottom wall, said member being composed of a single layer material forced therefrom while in a plastic state.
