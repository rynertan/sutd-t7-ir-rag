# Process for the preparation of thioethers.

## Abstract
Process for the prepration of thioethers by reacting a silylated thiol of the general formula R S SiR₁R₂R₃ I wherein R represents an organic group and R₁, R₂ and R₃ are the same or different and each represents an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, with an organic halide, sulphate or sulphonate in the presence of hexamethylphosphoric triamide as a solvent or co solvent. The process is carried out under neutral conditions in aprotic solvents at a temperature between 0 and 150 C.
