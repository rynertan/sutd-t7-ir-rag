# Safety circuit for a potentially dangerous machine monitored by light.

## Abstract
A safety circuit for a potentially dangerous machine M monitored by light and which works in an operating cycle. A safety circuit is described which utilises a series of relays A,B, C, D, G each of which is switched from an energised to a de energised condition once during each working cycle of the machine so that each of the relay contact also opens and closes during the working cycle. In this way each relay contact is tested. The relays are so interconnected that if one contact should stick it will interrupt the sequence and will ensure the potentially dangerous machine e.g. a press is rendered inac tive. Circuits are given for both hand fed and automatic machines which are monitored by a light barrier or curtain 17 . For the hand fed machine the cycle is initiated by the operator reaching through the light barrier to insert an object into the machine. For an automatically fed machine the test cycle is initiated by a switch 27 automatically activated once per cycle.
