# Process and apparatus for the conversion of agglomerating hydrocarbonaceous solid material to a more valuable gaseous product.

## Abstract
An improved apparatus and process for the conversion of hydrocarbonaceous materials, such as coal, to more valuable gaseous products in a fluidized bed gasification reaction and efficient withdrawal of agglomerated ash from the fluidized bed is disclosed. The improvements are obtained by interduc ing an oxygen containing gas into the bottom of the fluidized bed 4 through a separate conduit 50 positioned within the center of a nozzle 40 adapted to agglomerate and withdraw the ash from the bottom of the fluidized bed. The conduit extends above the constricted center portion 44 of the nozzle and preferably terminates within and does not extend from the nozzle. In addition to improving ash agglomeration and withdrawal, the present invention prevents sintering and clin kering of the ash in the fluidized bed and permits the efficient recycle of fine material recovered from the products gases by contacting the fines in the fluidized bed with the oxygen as it emanates from the conduit positioned with the withdrawal nozzle. Finally, the present method of oxygen introduction permits the efficient recycle of a portion of the products gases to the reaction zone to increase the reducing properties of the hot product gas.
