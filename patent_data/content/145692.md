# IMPROVED AMMOXIDATION PROCESS

## Abstract
There is disclosed a process for the ammoxidation of hydrocarbons to unsaturated nitriles using a fluidized bed containing a mixture of active catalyst and discrete particles of an inert material to improve the yield of nitriles and inhibit the formation of by products.
