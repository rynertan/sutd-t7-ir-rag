# Attitude compensating indicator.

## Abstract
An indicator for measuring the liquid content of a container comprises an attitude compensating sensor in cluding at least one variable resistor assembly disposed in fluid contact with the container. In the instance where two resistor assemblies are employed, the resistor assemblies are located at opposite ends of the container and are elec trically connected to each other in series.
