# Process and device for the preparation of polymer melts which are substantially free of volatile components.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of alkene polymer melts being substantially free of volatile components comprises introducing an alkene polymer melt having a melt index of less than 4 dg min and a content of volatile components of less than 10 percent by weight into a cooled degasification extruder and subjecting the melt in the extruder kneading zone to intense cooling under pressure and in the extruder degasification zone to cooling which is less intense than in the kneading zone and under reduced pressure.
