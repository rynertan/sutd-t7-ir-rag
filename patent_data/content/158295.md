# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IMPROVING THE SENSITIVITY OF A LEAK DETECTOR UTILIZING A CRYOPUMP

## Abstract
A cryopump and method for using cryopumping to enhance the sensitivity of a leak detection system. The cryopump is used to control the relative pumping speeds of the gases normally frozen out on the pump or adsorbed in a cold adsorbent to thereby achieve the enhanced sensitivity of the system. The system is characterized by controlled access to the cold panel which is disposed within the warm panel.
