## Description
This invention relates to an X ray imaging system which enables taking an X ray picture of an object at a desired time while fluoroscopic observation is being conducted on the object. For radiographic examination of the gastro intestinal tract, it has been customary to administer a dose of contrast medium orally to a person to be examined and observe an area or part of interest of the tract fluoroscopically on a TV monitor, so that the moment the area takes a position and or assumes a state intended for examination, a high speed exposure is made to a silver halide film, which is developed to produce a picture of the area to be used for diagnosis. In the conventional method of taking X ray pictures at a high shutter speed by using a silver halide film, it is extremely difficult and requires a great deal of skill to make an exposure exactly at the time a picture useful for diagnosis should be taken since there is a time lag of about 1 one second between the time the instructions to take a picture were given and the time an exposure has actually been made. The time lag is chiefly caused by US A 3 745 245 discloses an X ray imaging system comprising an X ray tube for producing a beam of X rays to irradiate an object to be examined a high voltage source for energizing said X ray tube an image intensifier for producing an X ray image of said irradiated object a TV camera for converting said X ray image into a corresponding video signal a TV monitor for receiving said video signal to reproduce said X ray image as a visible image to be observed with the eye a frame memory for storing said video signal switch means for applying said video signal selectively to said TV monitor and said frame memory. Said system is operable in a first mode wherein a pulse like voltage to said X ray tube in synchronism with vertical scanning in said TV camera within the period of vertical blanking. After each exposure a field stored in said frame memory. The system may be switched into a second mode whereby exposure is interrupted and the last field stored in said frame memory during previous operation in the first mode is continuously displayed on said TV monitor. The object of the invention is to obtain a proper timing for making an exposure in radiography by eliminating the above mentioned causes for the time lag. Of the above three causes a , b and c , cause a can be eliminated by employing a video recording system for recording the video signals of an X ray image as picture data, and cause c can be eliminated by keeping the target of the X ray tube rotated at all times at the same high speed as when an X ray picture is actually taken. Therefore, the present invention is directed chiefly to elimination of cause b . An X ray imaging system according to the present invention is defined in the appended claims. In accordance with the invention, the filament current of the X ray tube is always kept at the same level as when a picture is taken, and the tube voltage is supplied in the form of pulses in synchronism with the vertical blanking period of the TV camera, and the pulse width of the tube voltage is changed depending upon whether a picture of an object under examination is taken or the object is fluoroscopically observed with the eye. In accordance with the invention, since the filament current of the X ray tube for fluoroscopic observation is kept at the same high level as when an X ray picture is taken, the delay which would otherwise be caused by the time required for the temperature of the filament of the X ray tube to be raised is eliminated. On the other hand, the amount of X rays emitted per unit time is regulated by changing the pulse width of the tube voltage, so that the person under fluoroscopic observation will receive a small radiation dose, and yet when an X ray picture is taken, the amount of X rays required for producing an image of high quality can be obtained. The invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Referring first to Fig. 1, there is schematically shown an X ray tube 11, which projects a beam of X rays onto a human body 12 being examined. As the beam passes through the body, an X ray image of the irradiated area of the body is formed in accordance with the X ray absorption characteristics of the body area. An image intensifier 13 receives the X ray image and converts it to a visible optical image, which is viewed by a TV camera tube 14, controlled by a camera control unit 15 which operates in the same manner as in a conventional TV broadcasting system. The TV camera tube 14 converts the optical image on the screen of the image intensifier 13 to a corresponding video signal, which is transmitted to an A D converter 16. When the X ray image of the body is to be fluoroscopically viewed by the observer, a switch SW is closed at a contact When the operator selects a proper timing to cause the switch SW to be changed over to the opposite contact One of the important features of the invention lies in the manner of controlling the tube voltage of the X ray tube 11. Referring now to Fig. 2, the vertical blanking signal of the TV camera is shown at Referring to Fig. 3, the vertical synchronizing signal of the TV camera is shown at The X ray emitting signal shown at Thus, the TV camera tube 14 is scanned in the manner shown at When the synchronizing signal β comes, the normal interlaced scanning is resumed, and at time t₂ the switch SW is operated to close at the contact The above described operation is controlled by a system controller 24. The X ray emitting signal shown at As previously mentioned,in the radiography mode of operation of the system, it is not interlaced scanning but progressive scanning that is conducted for one frame of the X ray image to obtain video signals to be stored in the frame memory 20 for subsequent photographing. The reason is as follows If interlaced scanning were conducted with two fields of one frame of the picture being consecutively scanned, generally the video signal obtained by scanning the second field would have been considerably attenuated as a whole as compared with the signal obtained by scanning the first field, so that the resulting picutre would have a very low quality with the brightness of the picture varying on alternate scanning lines. This is for the following reasons. Normally, the TV camera tube stores each field of a picture frame. In the radiography mode of operation, however, X ray emission is continued for a certain period of time, during which the TV camera tube 14 stores the whole frame at one time without dividing the frame into two fields to be separately and consecutively stored. Therefore, if the single frame were scanned twice by interlaced scanning, a certain amount of the stored charge would have been lost between adjacent two lines previously scanned in the first scanning opeation due to the area of the scanning beam spot occupying on the screen of the TV camera tube. If the area of the screen with the reduced stored charge were scanned in the subsequent scanning operation, the resulting second field would have a lower quality than the first, with resulting deterioration of the quality of the picture composed of the two fields. This is avoided by the single scanning conducted in the system of the invention. As described above in detail, the instant the system of the invention has been changed from the observation mode to the radiography mode, the operation of taking a radiograph can be commenced without delay. The operator need not be particularly experienced or skilled in the art but can take a good X ray picture of the object at a required time.
