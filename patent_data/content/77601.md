# PHOTOVOLTAIC SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE

## Abstract
A hydrogenated amorphous silicon PIN semiconductor device of hybrid construction has its p layer 16 deposited by reactive sputtering. Such a hybrid construction is of advantage in providing an ability to control the optical band gap of the p and n layers resulting in increased photogenera tion of charge carriers and device output.
