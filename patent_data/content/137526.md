# Arithmetic unit in data processing system with exponent overflow underflow detection.

## Abstract
A floating point arithmetic unit utilizes bit slice logic to handle the mantissae and bit slice logic to handle the exponents. The addition or subtraction of the exponents may lead to an overflow or underflow condition and programm able array logic units 22, 23, 24 are used to detect these conditions in parallel with the computation of the exponent so as to speed up overall computation. Specifically one operand with exponent bits EXPÃ˜ to EXP7 is tested to distinguish a middle range where there is an overflow or underflow, upper and lower ranges where overflow and underflow must exist and cross over ranges
