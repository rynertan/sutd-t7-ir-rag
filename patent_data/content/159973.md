# A hand implement for slicing foodstuffs.

## Abstract
A hand implement for slicing cheese, root vegetables and the like has a cutting blade 1 having an opening 4 for a cutting element 5 . In order to prevent the cutting blade from sticking to the foodstuff and to prevent the sliced food stuff 18 from sticking to the blade 1 , the blade is manufac tured from a bending resistant plastics material and the end parts of the cutting element 5 are cast or moulded in the blade so as to form a free slot 17 rearwardly of the cutting element 5 . The slot 17 is effective to form a layer of air between the sliced foodstuff 18 and the upper surface 8 of the blade and prevents adhesion between the blade 1 and the sliced foodstuff 18 .
