# DETERMINING A HIERARCHY OF PILIATED ORGANISMS AND A VACCINE PREPARED FROM SUCH ORGANISMS

## Abstract
The finding has been made that immunologically related piliated organisms exhibit a hierarchic relationship wherein the cross reactivity of the antisera to first pili against second pili in the series is greater for the senior members of the series than the cross reactivity of the first pili with the corresponding antisera from second pili. This asymmetric relationship leads to the situation where the juniormost pili in the series may be utilized to detect the presence of all members of the family senior to it and conversely the seniormost pili may be utilized to protect against infection by all strains junior in the series.
