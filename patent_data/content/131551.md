## Description
NESCRIPTION This intention generally relates to differential pressure measuring transmitters and, more particularly, to a transmitter of this s kind, which i is capable of compensating the effect of static pressure changes. Transmitter used for transmitting differential pressure values are well known and the most used ones can be roughly grouped in three groups, namely inductive, capacitive and resistive transmitters depending on the electric output quantity being proportional to an inductance, capacitance or resistance, change, respectively., Generally, at present, all the inductance, capacitance or resistance changes are transduced by electronic, processing circuits providing also for the possible, linearity and temperature change compensation. These transmitters providing from certain points of view good performances and a good measuring accuracy are affected however with the disadvantage of suffering the effect of static pressure changes acting on both the mechanical components and the electrical sensors this effect causes a zero offset and a linear characteristic slope change norially a reduction of the tranunitter output zero effect and field effect . These disadvantages are either inherent to some of theso measuring instruments and, unfortunately, have to be accepted by the users due to a lack of not yet provided coapensation of the static pressure effect changes or they have been reduced, normally by weightening or sophia sticating the mechanical structure, this, however, to the detriment of the c osts. The present invention aims to obviate the above mentoned diaadvantage by providing a differential pressure tranmmitter capable of giving a reading in which the of feet. of static pressure changes are minimized by means of a simple and inexpensive compensation system of elec tricel kind. These and other objects and advantages are attained by a differential pressure transmitter of the kind having a aeasuring transducer with a closed cell containing a filling liquid and a metal diaphragm, to which resistive or preferably inductive or capacitiveelements are applied, which are capable of converting the diaphragm deflection induced by the differential pressure applied across the cell in electrical quantity changes, wherein inside the cell at least a pressure sensitive element 1s provided, which is subjected to the filling liquid pressure a and is capable of giving an electric output in accordance with the pressure values. According to a feature of the present invention this component is preferably a pasted carbon resistor. This invention will be described now in a greater detail in the following description in connection with a preferred embodiment of the differential pressure value transmitter illustrated in the accompanying drawing, description and drawing being given by way of example only, which does not limit the scope of the invention and wherein, The sole Figure is a diametral section of the transdu cer according to this invention. Referring now to the drawing, the transducer cons st of a central body C formed of a pair of similar and symme trically opposed body halves A B which are fastened to each other in a sealed relationship by welding, for example. Body C is fastened and clamped by means of an outer sleeve 10 bearing on the body C through contact means 12. The two rigid half bodies A and B are structured such that, once they are coupled and sealingly fastened to each other, a chamber is formed within which a masu ring diaphragm M is disposed which is locked and sealed between the two half bodies along its periphery. The measuring diaphragm M divides this chamber into two half chambers HA and HB. The measuring diaphragm M includes a rigid block N formed of a suitable material exhibiting a high magnetic permeability. Secured to each of the half bodies A and B is a magnetic core 12 with associated energizing electric coil, which cores are facing the magnetic block forming part of the diaphragm M. Coils 15 are a.c. supplied through the ieadsrin 16 in order to produce a magnetic field the flux lines of which close through the associated magnetic core 1 and the rigid block N,thereby obtaining two magnetic circuits having the same electromagnetic values when the measuring diaphragm M is exactly in a rest condition and divides the chamber H into two halyes. Bach of the half chambers HA and HB is provided with seats 17A, 18A and 17B, 18B respectively, in which the bushings for the leads and the fittings for admitting a filling liquid, for example silicone oll, into the half chambers are housed. Provided in each of the lialf bodies A and B is a passage 19A, 19B opening at their inner ends in the associated half chambers HA,HB and at their outer ends, in spaces 20A, 20B externally defined by sealing diaphragms 21A, 21B, suitably welded and sealed to associated portions of half bodies A and B.Passages 19A, 19B communicate also with the seats 18A, 18B containing the filling liquid admitting fittings.Therefore, by admitting the filling liquid through the fittings located In the seats 18A, 18B, this liquid will fill all the voids forming the half chambers HA, HB, namely passages l9A, 19B, seats 18A, 18B and 17A, 17B, magnetic cores 14, air gaps TA, TB and the spaces between the half bodies A, B and the center diaphragm N and the rigid block N. Through the two sealed diaphragms2iA, 21B, being high flexibility and high corrosion resistance diaphragns, and through the filling liquid, the differential pressure applied to said sealing diaphragms Is transferred to the measuring diaphragm M which converts this differential pressure into a very small displacement of Its rigid blockN exhibiting a high magnetic permeability. This impercepti ble deflection, causes a change in the air gaps TA, TB of the two fixed opposite magnetic circuits formed of the magnetic cores 14 and the associated a.c. supplied coils 15. The difference between the initial and final values of the two inductances represents the differential pressure measuring transducer output. As already said, a transducer of this kind gives again a not perfectly accurate output, because, as the atati c pressure changes, this is still affected by a zbro off set and a lower slope. It has been surprisingly found that, by arranging inside the cell static pressure sensitive sensors of electrical nature a reasonably li near output with the pressure is obtained, which permits a more than satisfactory compensation of the effects of static pressure changes on the transmitter output signal, by min miin them.It has been found useful to employ as static pressure sensitive sensor of electrical nature a pasted carbon resistor which is particularly sensi ti ve to pressure changes This electrical resistor is therefore located Inside the body C of transducer, namely in each of the seats 17A, 17B intended to receive the bushings of the instrument leads in. These resistors, indicated in the drawing as RA, RB, are subjected to the filling fluid pressure and therefore to static pressure changes to which the transducer is subjected during its use. Resistors RA and RB are connected to the transducer processing.circui.t via leads 22 which are passed outside the transducer to be applied to the processing circuit. Therefore, it can be seen that, by resorting to a pair of simple resistors having the characteri sti c to be pressure sensitive, a compensation on the output processed signal of the instrument can be obtained, which minimizes the effects of static pressure changes. Of course, while the invention has been shown and described in the accompanying drawing as applied to a differential pressure measuring transducer of inductive kind only, it should be understood that At can be applied also to differential pressure measuring transducers of other kind, such as capacitive or resistive king byasui table choice of the pressure sensitive component of electrical nature to be applied inside the transducer body. What is essential is that this component is arranged inside the transducer body, that is in the location in which it is subjected directly or through the filling fluid to the differential pressure. It should be also understood that all the modifica tioni and changes within the reach of one skilled in the art can be made to the described apd illustrated embodi ment without departing from the scope of the invention.
