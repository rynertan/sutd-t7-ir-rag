# Apparatus for detecting and or measuring a magnetic vector potential field.

## Abstract
The apparatus includes two Josephson devices 17,18 in a Josephson interferometer configuration, a magnetic shielding envelope 11,12 with apertures 13,14 arranged so that the magnetic vector potential is confined to the vicinity of one only of the two Josephson devices but not the interferometer loop region and a detector 30 for detecting magnetic flux induced by the interaction of the Josephson device and the magnetic vector potential field . The detection of the magnetic vector potential offers a more advantageous range of dependence than the magnetic flux density.
