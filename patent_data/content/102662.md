# NON PLL CONCURRENT CARRIER AND CLOCK SYNCHRONIZATION

## Abstract
Concurrent carrier and clock synchronization are derived from an input signal in interdependent loops without the use of phase look loop PLL circuitry in order to improve operation at higher bit rates. An acquisition detection signal is generated only in response to predetermined minimum errors in both the received signal amplitude and the recovered carrier phase.
