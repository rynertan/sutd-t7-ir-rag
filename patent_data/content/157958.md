# Colour head up display system.

## Abstract
In a head up display system HUD a light emissive object is provided at an object plane 10 by a CRT 11 . Optics, including a collimator 12 and combiner 14 provide a col limated image at infinity viewable from an eye plane 15 overlaid on a view 16 through the combiner 14 . The light path from the object plane 10 to the eye plane 15 is folded by a folding mirror 17 for convenience. The optics is de signed for optimum accuracy over a particular object emis sion waveband. The CRT 11 emits light in two chromatically separated wavebands that is in two different colours . The combiner 14 is a diffractive optical element having reflective characteristics at both CRT emission wavebands. The reflec tive characteristics are provided by fringe patterns γ₁ for the first emission wavelength and γ₂ for the second emission wavelength of the CRT 11 , recorded in the combiner 14 by holographic techniques. The invention overcomes the problem of providing an accurate colour HUD presentation by permitting the use of a two colour oblect in an essentially monochrome design.
