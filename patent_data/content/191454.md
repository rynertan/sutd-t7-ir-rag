# ROTATE MECHANISM

## Abstract
A mechanism for rotating a hollow coil of wound mate rial about its longitudinal axis, the mechanism comprising one or more rollers affixed to a cantilevered support with the mechanism adapted for a telescope fit into the hollow in terior of the coil. The roller or rollers are capable of being rotated about their axes and are positioned and attached to the support so as to contact the interior surface of the coil with their axes parallel to the longitudinal axis of the coil whereby the coil may be rotated to wind or unwind material on or off of the coil.
