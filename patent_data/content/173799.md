# FULL ADDER CIRCUIT WITH SUM AND CARRY SELECTION FUNCTIONS

## Abstract
A logic operation circuit includes an exclusive OR circuit 10 for receiving first and second input signals, a carry output signal selection circuit 12 for selectively generating a sum signal or an inverted signal thereof as a carry output signal in accordance with an output signal from the exclusive OR circuit 10 , and a carry output signal selection circuit 14 for selectively generating a carry input signal or the first input signal as a sum signal in accordance with the output signal from the exclusive OR circuit 10 . The sum signal selection circuit 12 has first and second differential amplifiers Q7 to Q10 respectively driven by first and second output signals which are inverted to each other and received from the exclusive OR circuit 10 so as to generate the sum signal in accordance with the carry input signal, and the carry input signal selection circuit 14 has third and fourth differential amplifiers Q11 to Q14 respectively driven in accordance with the first and second output signals from the exclusive OR circuit 10 so as to generate carry output signals in accordance with the first input signal and carry input signal, respectively.
