# HYDRAULIC DISC BRAKE WITH A PARKING BRAKE MECHANISM

## Abstract
An improved hydraulic disc brake with a parking brake mechanism attached thereto is disclosed which comprises a piston for actuating brake pads, the piston being formed with a conical clutching surface on the inner wall thereof, a first mem ber sleeve adapted to come in tight contact with the clutch ing surface of the piston, a second member push rod thread ably engaged to the first member, an actuating lever opera tively connected to the second member by way of an actuating mechanism and a parking brake lever operatively connected to the actuating lever with the aid of a cable extending therebe tween. To inhibit increase of working stroke of the actuating lever by preventing rotation of the sleeve during actuation of the parking brake lever the piston or the sleeve is formed with means for decreasing contact area to increase contact pres sure such as a plurality of grooves on the conical clutching surface thereof.
