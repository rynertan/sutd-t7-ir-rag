# FM counter detector.

## Abstract
In counter type detector system suitable for a television receiver a standard angle modulated frequency signal is heterodyned 20 to a lower freauency prior to detection by the counter detector 30, 32 . The lower intermediate frequency permits the generation of a pulse signal which is averaged to produce a relatively high level detected output signal. After the angle modulated frequency signal has been converted to the lower frequency, additional selectivity 22, 24 may be used prior to detection to further attenuate signal frequencies above the lower carrier frequency.
