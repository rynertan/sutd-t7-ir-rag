The compounds of the present invention,that is, those embraced by formula I above and their non toxic, pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salts, have useful pharmacodynamic properties. More particularly, they exhibit potent ihhibittion of mediator release in numerous cell systems of warm blooded animals such as rats, guinea pigs and humans, and are therefore useful for the treatment of allergic diseases such as allergic asthma, rhinitis, con3unctivitis, hay fever, urticaria, food allergies and the like.Moreover, it has been realized that also compounds described in the above mentioned Japanese Patent No. 6813468 and excluded, therefore, from formula I above, namely compounds wherein n is 2, when R is hydrogen and h is 2 methyl, may exhibit similar pharmacological activity. Neither this nor any pharmacological activity, however, is mentioned in the Japanese patent.The new compounds inhibit, at a concentration of as low as 1 pool, the release of histamine and other mediators of anaphylaxis from granule containing cells like human basophils and mast cells, measured according to the following method Mediator release from mast cells and basophils has been implicated in many allergic and inflammatory disorders. The activity of compounds in inhibiting the non cytoxic exocytosis of such mediators can be evaluated in in vitro models such as the inhibition of mediator release from isolated cellular systems induced by antigen antibody interaction.We include here data obtained in examples of such models to illustrate the biological activity of the novel compounds and the broad scope of their activity.This information is provided in the following table.The cellular systems cited therein are as follows RPMC Rat peritoneal mast cell preparationGPBL Guinea pig leukocytes2HBL Human basophil enriched leukocytes3A comparison with the activities of the clinical standards theophylline and disodium cromoglycate DSCG in these systems is also provided.

Topical preparations for the eye may also be presented as ointments in a suitable inert base consisting of mineral oil, petrolatum, polyethylene glycols or lanolin derivatives, along with microbial preservatives.In addition to these dosage forms, a skin paint can also be formulated for application to the skin. In any of the foregoing formulations, a suitable dosage unit may contain from 0.005 to 500 mg of the active ingredient The effective dose of a compound of this invention depends on the particular compound employed, the condition of the patient, and on the frequency and route of administration, but in general is in the range of from 0.0001 mg kg to 10 mg kg, inclusive, of the patient s body weight.In the preferred topical administration, a 0.001 to 0.5 , preferably a 0.01 to 0.1 solution is provided for.As is common practice, the composition will usually be accompanied by written or printed directions for use in the medical treatment concerned, in this case as an antiallergic agent for the prophylaxis and treatment of for example, asthma, hayfever, rhinitis or allergic eczema.The following example illustrates the preparation and properties of compositions of this invention.For the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions, the compounds of the formula I are mixed in the usual way with appropriate pharmaceutical carrier substances and aroma, flavoring and coloring materials and formed, for example, into tablets or capsules or, with the addition of appropriate adjutants, suspended or dissolved in water or in an oil, for example corn oil.The compounds of the formula I can be administered orally and parenterally in liquid or solid form. As inJection medium, it is preferred to use water which contains the stabilizing agents, solubilizing agents and or buffers conventionally used for injection solutions. Additives of this type include, for example, tartrate, citrate and acetate buffers, ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, complex formers such as EDTA , antioxidants such as sodium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite or ascorbic acid , high molecular weight polymers such as liquid polyethylene oxides for viscosity regulation, and polyethylene derivatives of sorbitol anhydrides.Preservatives may also be added if necessary, such as benzoic acid, methyl or propyl paraben, benzalkonium chloride and other quaternary ammonium compounds.Solid carrier material which can be used include, for example, starch, lactose, mannitol, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, talc, silica, dibasic calcium phosphate, and high molecular weight polymers such as polyethylene glycol .Compositions suitable for oral administration can, if desired, contain flavoring and or sweetening agents. For topical administration, the compounds of the present invention can also be used in the form of powders or ointments, for which purpose they are mixed with, for example, powdered, physiologically compatible diluents or conventional ointment bases.The following examples illustrate a few pharmaceutical dosage unit compositions comprising a compound of the present invention as an active ingredient and represent the best modes contemplated of using the invention. The parts are parts by weight unless otherwise specified. Example 48TabletsThe tablet composition is compounded from the following ingredients N Phenyl S 3 4 4 chlorophenyl piperazin 1 yl propyl thio carbamate dihydrochloride 0.010 parts Stearic acid 0.010 Dextrose 1.890 Total 1.910 partsPreparation The ingredients are admixed in conventional manner, and the mixture is compressed into 1.91 gm tablets, each of which is an oral dosage unit composition containing 10 mg of the active ingredient. Example 49OintmentThe ointment composition is compounded from the following ingredients 3 4 4 Chlorophenethyl piperazin 1 yljpropanethiol dihydrochloride 2.000 parts Fuming hydrochloric acid 0.011 Sodium pyrosulfite 0.050 Mixture 1 1 of cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol 20.000 White vaseline 5.000 Synthetic bergamot oil 0.075 1 Distilled water q.s.ad 100.000 Preparation The ingredients are uniformly blended in conventional manner into an ointment, 100 gm of which contain 2.0 gm of the active ingredient. Example 50Inhalation aerosolThe aerosol composition is compounded from the following ingredients N Cyclohexyl S 3 4 4 chloro benzyl piperazin 1 yl propyl thio carbamate dihydrochloride 1.00 parts Soybean lecithin 0.20 Propellant gas mixture Freon 11, 12 and 14 q.s.ad 100.00 IIPreparation The ingredients are compounded in conventional manner and the composition is filled into aerosol containers equipped with a metering valve which releases 0.5 to 2.0 mg of active ingredient per actuation of the valve. Example 51Hypodermio solutionThe solution is compounded from the following ingredients N 4 Methoxyphenyl S 3 4 4 chlorophenethyl piperazin l yl propyl thiocarbamate dihydro chloride 5.0 parts Sodium pyrosulfite 1.0 Sodium salt of FDTA 0.5 Sodium chloride 8.5 n Double distilled water q.s.ad 1000.0 nPreparation The individual ingredients are dissolved in a sufficient amount of double distilled water, the solution is diluted to the indicated concentration with additional doubledistilled water, the resulting solution is filtered until free from suspended particles, and the filtrate is filled under aseptic conditions into 1 ml ampules which are subsequently sterilized and sealed. Each ampule contains 5 mg of the active ingredient. Example 52Topical solution ophthalmic or nasal The solution is compounded from the following ingredients N 4 n Butylphenyl S 3 4 3 4 chlorophenyl0propyl piperazin 1 ylipropyl thiocarbamate dihydro chloride 0.020 parts Disodium hydrogen phosphate 0.758 Dihydrogen sodium phosphate 0.184 Sodium chloride 0.365 parts Polyvinyl alcohol 3.500 I1 Benzalkonium chloride 0.010 Distilled water q.s.ad 100.000 Preparation The ingredients are dissolved in conventional manner to form an aqueous solution. The solution is appropriately filtered, with the ophthalmic solution requiring sterile filtration. Each ml of the solution contains 0,2 mg of the active ingredient. Any one of the other compounds embraced by formula I or a non toxic salt thereof may be substituted for the particular active ingredient in examples 48 through 52.Likewise, the amount of active ingredient in these illustrative examples may be varied to achieve the dosage unit range set forth above, and the amounts and nature of the inert pharmaceutical carrier ingredient may be varied to meet particular requirements.While the present invention has been illustrated with the aid of certain specific embodiments thereof, it will be readily apparent to others skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to these particular embodiments, and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention or the scope of the appended claims.
