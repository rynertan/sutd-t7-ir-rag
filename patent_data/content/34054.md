# Process for the separation of three components from a mixture by solid bed adsorption and desorption.

## Abstract
A process for separating three components from a feed stream employs an adsorbent and a desorbent which in com bination have selectivities for the three components in des cending order of magnitude and uses a simulated moving bed countercurrent flow system with an additional intermediate raf finate stream taken off in the mid region of the adsorption zone in addition to the usual extract and raffinate streams. In one embodiment, the first component is para xylene, the second component is ethylbenzene, and the third component is a mix ture of meta and ortho xylene. In another embodiment, the first component is meta xylene, the second component is a mixture of para xylene and ortho xylene, and the third compo nent is ethylbenzene.
