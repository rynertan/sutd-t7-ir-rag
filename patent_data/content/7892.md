# Final unloading apparatus.

## Abstract
When particulate material 52 reposing on a support or base 51 is to be carried off in an upward direction by means of a vertical conveyor 21 whose lower inlet end portion is vertically and laterally movable, there is a problem involved in the carrying off of the final, small layer of material on the base and material in recesses and nooks, for example, in the cargo holds of a vessel, which cannot be reached directly by the inlet end portion of the vertical conveyor. This problem has been solved by means of the final unloading apparatus according to the present invention. This apparatus is provided with a sleeve 31 which is adapted to be disposed about the inlet end portion of the vertical conveyor 21 , an elongate feed con veyor 39 which has a discharge end in communication with the interior of the sleeve and is journalled on the sleeve in such a manner that the feed conveyor is pivotal in a plane parallel to the axis of the sleeve, and an elongate collector 44 disposed transversely of the feed conveyor and journalled thereon, the collector being pivotal in a plane transverse to the longitudinal axis of the feed conveyor and supplying material to the inlet end of the feed conveyor.
