# Acceleration power supply.

## Abstract
An acceleration power supply includes a series connected semiconductor switches 31n with voltage divid ing elements 32n and another semiconductor switch 50 coupled in series to the series connected semiconductor switches for cutting off a power supply line connected to a load 18 of the apparatus. The series connected semiconduc tor switches and cutting off semiconductor switch have a function of a series regulator.
