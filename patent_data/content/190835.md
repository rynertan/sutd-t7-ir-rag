# Fan Mounting.

## Abstract
A fan casing for mounting a plurality of motor fan units for cooling electronic apparatus mounted in racks or cabinets, the casing comprising two identical planar mem bers 2 to be assembled so that the motor fan units are sandwiched between the planar members 2 with finger guard members 17 covering openings in the planar mem bers 2 . Inwardly directed projections 10 formed by a pierce and plunge operation are provided on the planar members 2 to engage in apertures in the motor fan units to locate the motor fan units 14 and indentations 11 are formed in the planar members 2 to receive and locate the finger guard members so that when the two parts of the casing are assembled the finger guard members are dis posed between the motor fan units and the planar members 2 . Attachment means are provided engaging in recesses 18 to couple the two planar members 2 one to the other, each planar member 2 has parts of side walls 5 and end walls 3, 4 integral therewith and the overall height 2D of the casing is 45 mm.
