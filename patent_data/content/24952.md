# Electrophotographic reprographic apparatus.

## Abstract
A color copier 1 having high resolution projection optics 4 is modified to include low resolution 5 electrical color correction apparatus. A latent electrostatic image of an origi nal is generated with conventional lamp 24 and lens 26 projection optics. This optical latent image is corrected for tone or color in real time by a parallel raster exposure arrangement. A raster input scanner RIS 8 generates elec trical raster image signals representative of the original. A processor 9 converts electrical correction signals according to a prescribed scheme from the raster image signals. A raster output scanner ROS 10 generates a raster latent image generated in registration with the optical latent image in response to the electrical correction signals. The RIS uses charge coupled devices CCD s 31 to generate the electrical raster signals and the ROS uses a laser 46 and galvanometer 51 to generate the raster latent image.
