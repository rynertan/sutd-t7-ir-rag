# Electrical stepper motor.

## Abstract
Stepper motor control circuitry is described including a phase locked loop circuit 120 formed by a phase detec tor 122 out putted to a filter 124 and a voltage control led triangular and square wave generator 126 which has a frequency control input terminal J connected to the output of the filter 124 and which provides a square wave on an output 134 thereof connected as an input to the phase detector 122 . An oscillator 144 drives the phase detector 122 , and the outputs 132, 134, 140 of the generator 126 are connected as inputs to a pulse width a modulated driver 146 which has its outputs connected to the coils W, X, Y, Z of the stepper motor. A differential amplifier 156 is connected across one of the coils X of the motor, and a balanced modulator synchronous detector or multiplier 168 has two inputs one of which constitutes an output of the differential amplifier and the other of which is a connection to the square wave output 134 of the generator 126 . The output of the multi plier 168 constitutes an error signal which is supplied to a summing junction 176 between the filter 124 and generator 126 so that, upon the application of an instan taneous load to the stepper motor, the error signal causes a very quick return to normal speed of the motor.
