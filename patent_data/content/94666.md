# Method of preparing polyprenyl compounds or mixtures thereof.

## Abstract
Polyprenols or esters thereof, which are similar in the trans and cis configurations to dolichol, or mixtures thereof are obtained from the leaves of plants belonging to the genus Pinus L. of the family Pinaceae by extraction, if necessary followed by hydrolysis, esterification or trans esterification or a combination thereof. These polyprenyl compounds and mixtures thereof are useful as favorable starting materials for the synthesis of dolichol.
