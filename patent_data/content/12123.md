# A device for heating a fluid.

## Abstract
A device for heating of a fluid by means of electrical heating plates 6 or the like in heat transferring contact with a conduit through which said fluid is adapted to flow. A temper ature transmitter is adapted to abut a member, carrying con tact means 19b , in contact with said conduit for measuring of the temperature of the heated fluid at such a distance from said heating plates that said temperature transmitter is essen tially completely uninfluenced by radiant and or conductive heat therefrom. Said contact means comprise one or more scores 21 , so that said fluid at lower rates of flow is concen trated to a flow path in close contact with said temperature transmitter. The device is primarily intended for use in heating of infusate, such as blood, which is inserted into a patient at flow rates of between 15 and 150 ml per minute.
