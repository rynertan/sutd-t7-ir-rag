# Stabilizer compositions, halogen containing polymer compositions containing the same and shaped articles containing said polymer compositions.

## Abstract
Compositions which are effective in stabilizing polymers against the deteriorative effects of heat are provided com prising 1 an organic tin compound or mixture of organic tin compounds and 2 an organic compound or mixture of organic compounds having an aromatic ring which is substituted with hydroxy OH and mercapto ST groups ortho to each other. Also provided are polymer compositions containing said stabilizers and articles of manufacture made from said stabilized polymer compositions.
