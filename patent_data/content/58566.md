# Process for producing a semiconductor device using a diffusion step.

## Abstract
In a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device first and second doped regions 15a, 15b are formed in the surface of a semiconductor substrate 11 and an epitaxial layer of semiconductor material is formed on the surface of the substrate to cover the two regions. The epitaxial layer is irradiated L selectively in the vicinity of the first doped region 15a so as to bring about controlled diffusion of dopant into the epitaxial layer from the first doped region 15a preferentially as compared with the second doped region 15b .
