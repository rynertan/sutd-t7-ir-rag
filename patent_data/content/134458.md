# Stator for a magnet motor.

## Abstract
A stator for a magnetic motor comprising a cylindrical yoke 2 , at least one pair of main magnetic poles 14 formed of permanent magnets fixed to the inner peripheral surface of the yoke 2 , at least one pair of auxiliary magnetic poles 15 made of a soft iron material each placed at a side portion of each of the main magnetic poles 14 , wherein an air gap rm between the inner peripheral surface of each of the main magnetic poles 14 and the outer peripheral surface of an armature 6 rotatably arranged in the axial center of the yoke 2 is greater than an air gap rp between the inner peripheral surface of each of the auxiliary magnetic poles 15 and the outer peripheral surface of the armature 6 .
