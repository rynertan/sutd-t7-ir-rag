# TRACERS FOR DISOPYRAMIDE ASSAY AND IMMUNOGENS TO RAISE ANTIBODY

## Abstract
This invention relates to an improved fluorescent polar ization assay for disopyramide, and to improved reagents tracer compounds and immunogen for use in the assay. The 10 tracer compounds are the reaction product of p or m aminodisopyramide with 10 fluorescein compounds. The tracers form complexes with antiserum specific to disopyr amide, in proportion to the relative concentration of the tracer with respect to the disopyramide present in the sample. Excellent results are obtained when such a tracer compound is used in fluorescent polarization assay for disopyramide, with greater speed and less cross reactivity than prior art methods of immunoassay.
