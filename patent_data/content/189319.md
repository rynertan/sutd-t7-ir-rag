## Description
The present invention relates to a phase locked loop and more particularly to a phase locked loop which is suitable for the case where the ratio between the input signal and output signal is not a simple integer. A phase locked loop PLL is generally formed of a phase comparator 1, low pass filter 2, voltage controlled oscillator 3, and a frequency dividing circuit 4 as shown in figure 10, and the output f In a TBC Time Base error Corrector for removing the jitter along the time axis of a regenerated video signal, however, a phase locked loop in which the ratio between the input frequency and output frequency is not a simple integer is required for restoration of the interleave of the luminance signal and colour signal. That is, the colour subcarrier frequency f Since the offset frequency 1 2 f GB A 2097206 discloses a phase locked loop PLL circuit according to the precharacterising part of claim 1. It is an object of the invention to provide a phase locked loop which will produce the output in synchronism with the input signal even if the ratio between the input frequency and output frequency is not a simple integer, that is, for example in the case where A further object of the invention is to provide a phase locked loop which, in a processing circuit for processing the colour television signal of the PAL system, will generate a colour subcarrier frequency in synchronism with the horizontal synchronising signal. The present invention provides a phase locked loop comprising Since the phase modulator whose phase shift amount linearly varies and the dividing ratio of the frequency dividing circuit in the phase locked loop are controlled with the period relative to the offset frequency, the phase locked loop is able to generate an output frequency such that will be the sum of the input frequency or an integral multiple thereof and a small offset frequency. The invention will be further described by way of non limitative example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing a phase locked loop hereafter to be referred to as a PLL circuit of one embodiment of the invention, wherein, the same as in Fig. 10, 1 denotes a phase comparator, 2 denotes a low pass filter, 3 denotes a voltage controlled oscillator, and 4 denotes a frequency dividing circuit. Numeral reference 5 denotes a phase modulator which performs phase modulation according to a signal supplied from outside and adapted such that, when a ramp wave, for example, is input thereto, the phase shift amount will linearly increase with time. Accordingly, even if the divided frequency f In the above case, the shift control wave MW must linearly increase the phase shift caused by the phase modulator 5 with time and this is not an easy thing to achieve. However, if it were possible to bring the signal of the input frequency f But, in the case where the input frequency f The mentioned process may be described more generally in the following. In the PLL circuit as described above, the output frequency f The term Now, if it is expressed, using two integers m and n, such that then m indicates the number of clocks of the output frequency f Therefore, if the above equations 2 are applied, in the circuit of Fig. 1 it is shown that there exists the phase difference corresponding to n clocks between the input frequency f From the above equations 2 are derived Fig. 3 is a block diagram concretely showing the circuit generating the output Numeral reference 6 denotes a counter for driving, upon its making m counts of the output frequency f By the described arrangement of the PLL circuit, as shown in Fig. 4, when the predetermined count value m is reached in the counter 6 for counting the number of clocks of the output frequency f And, the clocks of the output f Therefore, according to the present PLL circuit, the difference Δ f between the input frequency f By the way, in Fig. 3, it may also be possible to adapt the frequency dividing circuit 4 to be directly controlled by the output of the counter 6 so that its dividing ratio will become 1 N n . This will be practiced, for example, by the use of the frequency dividing circuit formed of a counter, into which a preset count value is to be loaded, this counter being counted down by the input signal and the frequency divided output being provided by decoding that the count value of the counter is zero. In such an arrangement, the preset count value may be changed according to the output of the counter 6. Fig. 5 indicates an embodiment of the PLL circuit of the invention for forming the previously described color subcarrier frequency f The color subcarrier frequency f This accounts for 2 1135 2π of phase difference for one field, namely, it corresponds to 2 clock phase difference of the 4 f Therefore, the purpose is attained by adapting the frequency dividing circuit 14 to ignore the clock signal of n 2 clocks duration for each field in the manner as described above and the shift control signal generator 17 to be reset at the interval of one field corresponding to the above described m clock period. Fig. 6 indicates phase shift amounts in the signal f H output from the phase shifter 15 for each horizontal synchronizing signal H, wherein f H 312, or the maximum phase shift amount to be provided at the end of one field, is indicated by ₃₁₂. The maximum phase shift time duration is Fig. 7 is a block diagram showing an embodiment of the invention of the phase locked loop suitable for outputting a color subcarrier of the PAL system. Referring to the drawing, the same as in Fig. 5, 11 denotes a phase comparator, 12 denotes a low pass filter, 13 denotes a voltage controlled oscillator, 14 denotes a frequency dividing circuit whose dividing ratios are switchable either to 1 1135 or to 1 1137, and 15 denotes a phase shifter. Reference numeral 16 denotes a signal source of current voltage capable of providing the maximum phase shift amount at the time point when the vertical synchronizing signal V is obtained as described above and its output value is adapted to be supplied to a sawtooth wave generator 17. Reference numeral 18 denotes an integrating circuit for integrating the difference of the signals supplied thereto and 19 denotes a latch circuit. In this embodiment, the same as in the example of the above described Fig. 5, the dividing ratio of the frequency dividing circuit 14 is changed from 1135 to 1137 corresponding to the 2 clock duration by the vertical synchronizing signal V to be output for each field and, further, the sawtooth wave generator 17 for providing the phase shift amount of the phase shifter 15 is reset at the same time. With reference to the ramp angle of the sawtooth wave determining the phase shift amount, the maximum phase shift amount at the time when the vertical synchronizing signal V is obtained is compensated by the signal source 16 through comparison of the output of the phase shifter 15 with the output of the voltage controlled oscillator 13, and so, specifically changes in the phase shift amount due to temperature variation can be eliminated. Further, the phase shifter 15 is supplied with the clock of higher frequency than 4 1135 f Therefore, the shift amount of the phase shifter 15 and the duty of the clock period becomes high and the loop gain including the integrating circuit 18 becomes high, and thus, the effect is produced that the linearity of the phase shift amount is improved. Now, operations of the phase modulator as indicated in Fig. 7 and the reason why linearity of the phase shift amount is improved by the use of this phase modulator will be described referring to Figs. 8 and 9. Fig. 8 is a block diagram showing the portion of the phase modulator extracted from Fig. 7, wherein CI, corresponding to 18 in Fig. 7, denotes a comparator supplied with a shift control wave S And, PS, corresponding to 15 in Fig. 7, denotes a phase shifter formed of a monostable multivibrator, a variable delay circuit, etc. and LA denotes a latch circuit corresponding to 19 in Fig. 7. Operations of the phase modulator indicated in Fig. 8 will be described below with reference to the waveform chart of Fig. 9. The phase shifter PS is supplied with a sub signal CK 1 8 f Assuming now that H level periods T where T is the period of the sub signal clock signal CK . Representing the value of the H level by S If it is assumed here that there is a relationship As understood from the above equation 11 , if the feedback loop is structured by the comparator CI, the phase shift amount T And, if we take out from the equation 11 the relationships between the level values S Therefore, the phase modulator of the present invention is arranged so that the sub signal CK to be modulated which is input to the phase shifter PS will have a higher frequency than the main signal f By so doing, the gain of the feedback loop including the comparator CI becomes larger and the variation in the phase shift amount due to change in the temperature of the circuit can be suppressed. The main signal f Although in the above described embodiments, the circuit was structured such that the phase modulation is made after the frequency division, the PLL circuit may be structured such that the frequency division will be made after the phase modulation. And, it will also be possible to apply phase modulation to the input frequency f As described so far, the phase locked loop of the present invention has been arranged such that a PLL circuit is provided with a phase modulating circuit for linearly changing the phase and the phase modulating circuit is adapted to be reset at an interval of the period related to the offset frequency and the dividing ratio of the frequency dividing circuit is controlled so that the initial phase relationship is provided at the mentioned resetting time point. Thus, an effect is obtained that an output frequency having a small offset frequency with respect to the input frequency can be formed easily.
