# Protective zone apparatus on a vehicle.

## Abstract
A protective zone apparatus on a vehicle capable of travelling along a path has a light transmitter 16 and a light receiver 18 . The transmitted light beam 11 is obliquely directed onto the path of travel 12 at a first fixed angle α and executes a scanning movement about an axis 13 perpendicular to the path of travel 12 . The received light beam extends at a second fixed angle β from the point of impingement 15 of the transmitted light beam 11 on the path of travel 12 to the perpendicular axis 13 and executes a scanning movement synchronous with that of the transmit ted light beam 11 . An electronic processing circuit trans mits a control signal which stops the vehicle if an obstacle arises in the protective zone.
