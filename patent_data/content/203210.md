## Description
Title CONE CONTROL METHOD AND TOOL FOR FABRICATING COMPOSITE SHAFTS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the invention. The present invention relates generally to a n.otho 1. of controlling the dimensional anci surface characteristics of portions of a mandrel wound composite shaft, and specifi cally to a method of modifying the fabricating technique of a composita shaft which has at least one flared end, and a tofil used in the modified fabrication technique. The composite shafts are fabricated from continuous filaments in either a roving or tape form within a resin matrix and subsequently cured to form a rigid monolithic structure. The composite shafts fabricated may be usec in a static structural application or in a dynamic environment where they relay be required to transmit torque and power. 2. Prior Art. Composite shafts and apparatus for fabricatillc thor. ar. known. See, for example, U.S. Patent 3,733,233. In this paLcnt, filament winding is disclosed as the lzrefcrred mouc of fabrication. Instead of the filament winding, how ever, a tape winding could be used. To couple the shafts fabricated in accordance with the teaching of the noted patent, the shaft ends must be modified or a coupling pro vided. An example of such an end modification can be seen in U.S. latent 4,362,521. In this patent a metal end fitting IS provided which is pushed into the shaft end and is engaged by a pair of bolts for torque transmission.The shaft end which accomodates the metal end fitting is provided with a cemented in sleeve and a cemented on tubular portion so that the wall thickness of the shaft is not uniform along its length. According to another known end modification technique, an end fitting is wound into the shaft end and as such is locked in and cannot be removed. Since such designs generally require a thicker wall in the coupler fastener area their is an associated penalty of cost and weight because extra meterial is required. Also, pin or bolt holes in a composite structure are undesirable because they cut the load carrying filaments and introduce an interlaminar shear condition, i.e., one requiring the resin to transfer load to the next fiber. These coupler fastener designs are undesirable from a structural standpoint.They are also undesirable because they compromise the simplicity of mandrel winding due to the need to alter the winding schedule in order to properly secure the coupler fastener, or build up material in the coupler portion of the shaft. It would be desirable, therefore, to fabricate a composite shaft which has a generally uniform wall thickness along its length, which does not require a permanently secured coupler fastener, which does not require that its ends have holes formed therein, and which does not compromise the simplicity of, for example, a filament winding techinque. Also, it would be desirable to fabricate a composite shaft which does not require any substantial X ounc o nia√ßh ning and eliminates inner and outer machining at its ends. OBJECTS M D SUGARY OF THZ INVENTION One object of the present invention is to provide the existing state of the art with a method of fabricating a composite shaft which does not require permanently secured end fittings. Another object of the present invention is to provide the existing state of the art with a method of fabricate ins a composite shaft with at least one flared end so that surface machining is not necessary. A related object of the present invention is to provide the existing state of the art with a tool for use in fabricating a composite shaft with better control of form and surface at at least one end. Another object of the present invention is to provide the existing state of the art with a method of fabricat ing a composite shaft where at least one end has uniform concentric, tapered and tooled inner and outer surfaces. A related object of the present invention is to provide the existing state of the art with a tool for fabricating a composite shaft where at least one end has uniform concentric, tapered and tooled inner and outer surfaces imparted by the tool. Another object of the present invention is to provide the existing state of the art with a method and tool as previously stated wherein the shaft after curing and parting off the mandrel is in a condition of completeness such that the shaft can be assembled without the necessity of any further substantial machining. Another object of the present inventinn is tpro vide the existing state of the art with a method according to which at least one shaft end has a shoc fretting resistant property. The present invention, like that disclosed in the noted co pending application, departs from the existing stateof the art by the provision of a flared end feature. The present invention takes the invention disclosed in the noted co pending application one step further in that both the method and tool produce a shaft with at least one flared end the inner and outer external circumferential surfaces of which are of machine like quality. This quality is achieved without machining and the associated cutting of fibers which is detrimental to the structural integrity of the shaft produced. The tool includes, in its essential parts, a mandrel and a specially adapted end fitting or end fittings, depending on whether one or both ends of the shaft are to be flared.The end fittings define the angle and direction of flaring.They also give the tool its conforming compacting capability. An elastomeric coating is contemplated in conjunction with the end fittings. The elastomeric coating when applied, is applied to at least one of the inner and outer surfaces of each flared end of the shaft. The elastoireric coating provides a fretting resistant resilient property to the coupler interface such that tiie coupler loads are trans X ted through the elastomeric. The method utilizes the conforming compacting capability to produce a machine like surface at the inner and outer surfaces of each flared end of the shaft. According to the method, conforming compacting can pro eed 1nt mediately, i.e., at selected intervals in the winding schedule, or after winding is completed. The intermediate option produces a more optimized result. In conjunction with conforming compacting, the method contemplates producing an optimized fiber placement and a controlled resin density in the flared ends of the shaft.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PEaFEPRED ENBODIL iENT At least one end of the composite shaft fabricated in accordance with the method and the tool of the present invention i s provided with a flared end having substantially parallel inner and outer surfaces which serve as bearing surfaces which are engaged by corresponding surfaces of a coupling. The conformity of the bearing surfaces is of irportance. Any surface which is manufactured by, for example, the winding of fibers on a mandrel produces irregularities, which appear as peaks and valleys. A given total bearing load will necessarily be supported upon the peaks thereby greatly increasing the local unit pressure developed. It is essential, therefore, to produce a smooth and regular bearing surface in order to properly distribute the bearing loads. Although an acceptable outer bearing surface can be achieved through a procedure of winding layers of sacrifial fibers and resin which after curing would be machined to the desired surface shape and finish, such a procedure imposes the penalties of added weight and cost, as well as manufacturing time and risk because of the potential for human error. To achieve the desired machine like surface, i.e., a surface which is smooth and conformcble tc .a Jesira .s ape, at the flared ends of the composite shaft, it is proposed according to the present invention to employ a means for moldina fiber adjustment, hereafter referred to as conforming compacting. For this purpose a pair of cone rings are provided at each flared end of the shaft which act as molds imparting their surface condition to the inner and outer end surfaces of the shaft with which it is engaged.The cone rings can be applied at the end of the winding of the composite shaft, or in addition, at intermediate stages of the winding. In either case, care must be exercised to insure that the compacting force applied to the cone rings is not excessive or deficient. If the force is excessivc, a resin starved structure can result, and if the force is dificient, an irregular and resin rich surface structure can result. Neither condition is desirable. The cone control process of the present invention is ideally suited to provide the proper degree of force application, either, or preferrably, in conjunction with the known debulking procedures. A cordi ig to one such procedure bleed cloth and shrink tape are applied to the winding at various stages to soak up excess resin and apply a compacting force to tire winding.The periodic application of the bleed cloth and shrink tape can be followed by the placement of the cone rings at a flared end, followed by the application of a force to the outer cune ring, which force is directed substantially axially of the shaft longitudinal axis, causing the outer cone ring to be biased toward the inner cone ring and thereby compact the wi .dinCJ between them. Turning now to Fig. 1, a tool 40 s shown wkic includes a tubular mandrel 12 and mandrel end fitting assemblies 14 and 16. The tool 10 is mounted in a machine Fig. 2 for filament winding or tape winding onto the mandrel 12. Any of a number of known machines for this purpose can De used. A composite shaft 18 is formed by the noted winding process. As such the fiber direction is substantially helical with respect to axis A A. This fiber orientation is preferred for drive shaft applications. If a uni directional orientation is desired either very small helical angles are used or a lay up procedure is used. Such a lay up pro cedure is known. The mandrel 12 is provided at each end with a pilot diameter 20 each defining a similar pilot diameter in the mating part. The outer surface of the mandrel 12 can have a slight taper in its extension between the pilot diameters 2Q which facilitates removal of the mandrel after fabrication of the shaft 18. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, the mandrel end fitting assembly 14 includes a turn around end fitting 22, an inner cone ring 24 the previously noted nating part an outer cone ring 26 and a conforming com.pacting force generator 28. The inner cone ring 24 has an outwardly flared wall which defines a cone surface 30 and a cylindrical end surface 32. The cylindrical end surface 32 is received in and engages the pilot diameter 20 at one end of the mandrel 12. At its other end the inner cone rig 24 is provided with a pilot seat flange 34.Between its two ends and adjacent to that portion which defines the cone surface 30 the inner cone ring 24 may hea ideq with a relief groove 35 which is filled in with, for example, resin prior to winding. The outer ring 26 is designed to be compatible with the inner ring 24 so that it flares outwardly as does the inner cone ring 24. The turn around end fitting 22 includes a curved dome 36. The dome 36 is connected with or formed integral with a spindle 38. At its other end the spindle 38 is provided with threads 40. Between the threads 40 and the curved dome 36 the spindle 38 is provided with three centering lands 42, 44, and 46. These lands define two stop surfaces 48 and 50. A shim 52 provides an adjustable stop feature.At the front end of the curved dome 36 a compound groove 54 is formed in which a pilot seat diameter 56 is defined which is engaged by the pilot seat flange 34. The conforming compacting force generator 22 includes a force transmitting cylinder 58 and a pair of bul r. head centering rings 60 and 62. The inner bulkhead ring 60 pilots on land 46, while the outer bulkhead ring 62 pilots on land 44 and engages the adjustment shim 52. At its front surface the force transmitting cylinder 58 is provided with a pilot diameter 64 on which one end of the outer reaction ring 26 is received. The outwardly facing outer surface 66 of the outer bulkhead centering ring 62 has at least one but preferably two or more, diameterically opposed, circular recesses GS formed thereon. These recesses receive one end of a spring 70. The other end of the spring 70 fits within a spring seat 72 of a ring 74. The ring 74 has a bolt receiving seat 76 on its opposed surface within which the front end of the threaded bolt 7D is received. The threaded bolt 78 passes through a threaded hole S0 in an annular bulk head ring 82. The exposed end of the threaded bolt 78 has a head 84 within which a torque wrench socket GG is provided. The mandrel end fitting assembly 16 is slightly modified in comparison with the mandrel end fitting assembly 1 to account for the fact that an outward rather than an inward flared end is desired. An inner cone ring 88 defines a cone surface 90. The surface 90 extends upwardly from the mandrel 12 rather than upwardly to the mandrel 12 as does the surface 30. The spring 92 of the conforminc compacting force generator 94 is located on the outside of the annular bulk head ring 95 so that the outer cone ring 96 is pulled rather than pushed as is the outer cone ring 26. For this purpose, the outer cone ring 96 and the force transmitting cylinder 98 are threadedly engaged at 100. A limiting shim stop 102 functions to limit travel of the outer cone ring 9G. According to the method aspect of the present invention, filaments or tape are dispensed onto the mandrel 12, inner cone rings 24 and 88 and the domes 36. An apparatus for winding the filaments is schematically illustrated in Fig.2. The tool 10 is shown with the mandrel 12 mounted for rotation between end supports 104 and 106. The mandrel 12 is shown to include an inwardly flared end and an outwardly flared end as in Fig. 1. Filaments or tape 108 are wound on mandrel 12 by a shuttle tyne device 110 as the mandrel 12 rotates about its axis A A, while the conforming compacting force generators 28 and 94 are deployed after a filar.lent winding sequence. As noted, the filaments or tape are wound onto the mandrel 12, the inner cone rings 24 and 5 and the domes 36. The domes 36 provide a turn around which pemi t .s the. quaint tln√ße of fiber tension during successive passes of the winding apparatus. The domes 36 also maintain fiber tension during the conforming compacting step. As previously noted, according to one preferred feature of the present invention, conforming compacting with the cone rings occurs after the build up is completed. Alternatively, conforming compacting can proceed at intermeiate stages during winding. In either case, conforming compacting is accomplished by adjusting the spring force of the springs 70 and 92, which adjusted force is applied to the outer cone rings 26 and 96 by the force transmitting cylinders 58 and 98, respectively. In the case of the cone ring 26, the force is a pushing force, while for the cone ring 96, the force is a pulling force. In either case, the cone rings are urged by the adjusted force toward their respective inner cone rings, and consequently the composite material between the composite material engaging surfaces of the representative pairs of cone rings is conformed compacted. The cone rings serve as molds in the process of conforming compacting. The conforming compacting has the beneficial effect of producing a concentric machine like surface at the outer flared end surfaces of the composite build up, i.e., the conformity and finish of these surfaces is as if they were machined. Also, conforming compacting aids in producing an optimized resin distribution in the build up, along with or without the debulking procedure so that neither a resin starved nor resin rich structure will result. It has been found that the intermediate application of conforming compacting achieves optimization more readily than a single conforming compacting at the completion of the winding. The only machining that is necessary is the parting of the composite shaft on the mandrel after curing at planesB B and C C. For this purpose the outer cone rings 26 and 96 are removed along with the mandrel end fitting assemblies 14 and 16. To facilitate the cutting of the composite shaft 18 at the planes ss B and C C, the relief groove 35 and a corresponding relief groove 112 can be provided. These relief grooves are preferably filled with a cured resin material prior to winding. As a result, cutting of the inner cone is prevented and the composite shaft is cleaving cut. The use of pilot diameters diameters 20, lands 42, 44 and 46, which define stops 48 and 50, and diameter 56 are employed in order to control the concentricity of the composite shaft fabricated. Also, the outer cone rings can be centered as are the inner cone rings for concentricity control. The pilot diameter 64 Fig. 1 serves to center the outer cone ring 26 as well as to transmit force from the force transmitting cylinder 58 to the outer cone 26. After the step of conforming compacting, the tool re plains in place with load applied during curing. Curing is accomplished in a known manner. Curing structuralizes the build up, i.e., it renders it rigid and capable of carrying a load independently. If before or after partial or final curing, it is determined that the flared ends of the outer surfaces require additional material to nroduce the desired conical configurations, those arcade 115 i icj. 3 can be filled wit resin and fibers to achieve the desired configuration.Also, before curing, after partial curing or after total curing of the build up, the inner and outer flared surfaces may be coated with an elastomeric and fretting resistant coa in 15U , 152 Fig. 6 such as a urethane coating to impart a shock resistant resilient property to the coupler interface such that the coupler loads are transmitted through the elastomer. As also shown in Fig. 3, the flared ends of the shaft can be fabricated to include at least one flat surface 114 and preferably a series of these flat surfaces. These flat surfaces are desired when the composite shaft is to be used to transmit torque, although other known keying structures may be used when transmitting torque loads. To produce these flat surfaces in the flared ends of the shaft, the cone rings are provided with corresponding flat surfaces. In this way it is possible to provide either or both the inner and outer surfaces of the flared ends of the shaft with flat surfaces. The flat surfaces on the inner surface of the flared end of a shaft develop during the winding process, while the flat surfaces on the outer surface of the flared end of a shaft develop during the conforming compacting process. The conforming compacting process also has the effect of enhancing the flat surfaces on the inner surface of the flared end of the shaft because the conforming compacting force is transmitted through the composite material to the inner cone ring. The cone rings 24, 26, 88, and 96 form part of the tool 10. They can also, however, serve as coupling elements similar to those discussed in the noted copending application. Two applications of the invention are shown in Figures 4 7. The applications shwon in Figures 4 and 5 is to a helicopter rotor head. In Figures 4 and 5 a composite shaft 116 with an inwardly flared portion is shown to which a rotor hub 118 is connected. The shaft 116 serves as the drive shaft for driving the rotor hub 118. A threaded adapter 120 i5 axlounted within the flared portion of the shaft 116 and extends outwardly therefrom. The outwardly extending portion includes a threaded region 112 which receives a retaining nut 124 on threaded engagement. The retaining nut 124 bears against a retaining plate 126 which secures and preloads the rotor hub 118 to the shaft 116.The shaft 116 is fabricated according to the method noted above to include flat surfaces 128 and 130 on both the inner and outer surfaces, respectively of the inwardly flared portion of the shaft 116, as shown inFig. 5. Flat surfaces 132 are formed on the otuer surface of the threaded adapter 120 which are compatible and engage with the flat surfaces 128. In this particular application of the invention, the flat surfaces 128, 130, and 132 are tapered as shown in Figure 4, i.e., they are more pronounced at one end. At the end shown in Figure 5, the flat surfaces are most pronounced, while at the opposite end of the inwardly flared portion a cross section thereof would reveal a circular outer circumference without flat surfaces. The threaded adapter 120 can be fabricated as is the shaft 120 according to the principles of the present invention. In Figures 6 and 7 a composite shaft 134 with an outwardly flared portion is shown. The inner surface of the outwardly flared portion defines a circumference with tapered flat surfaces 136, while the outer surface defines a circular circumference. In this application the shaft 134 is intended to be driven only and is not intended to also drive, as in the application shown in Figures 4 and 5 where the shaft 116 also drives the rotor hub 118. The shaft 134 is driven by a shaft 138 which includes an inwardly tapered portion, so tapered to be compatible with the ouwardly tapered portion of the shaft 134. The shaft 13 includes tapered flat surfaces 140 with are compatible and engage with the flat surfaces 136. The application shown in Figs. 6 and 7 has an inner driving member 138 with centering pilot 146 and flange 144 Outer cone ring 142 is secured to inner member 138, by, for example, a bolt pattern, and provides a means of compressing preloading drive shaft 134. The compressing preloading and keying features of the inner member 138 and outer cone ring 142 significantly enhance the load carrying ability of the coupling where such loads can be torsional, axial and bendingAs such, the bolted flange arrangement provides the same function as does the ring of Figure 4.
