# Piezoelectric vibration transducer.

## Abstract
A piezoelectric vibration transducer 7 for scanning and or focusing ultrasonic waves which comprises a series of piezoelectric vibration elements Tn fabricated with a polymer piezoelectric film 9 such as piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride film 9 sandwiched by electrode plates 8, 10 and lead wires 12, 13 connected to the electrode plates An . The transducer 7 has low cross talks between the vibration elements, excellent acoustical matching characteristics with water or living body, and advantageous fabrication characteristics for manufacturing it with simple processes and with low cost.
