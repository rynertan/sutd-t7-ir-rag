# Method and means for real time image zoom display in an ultrasonic scanning system.

## Abstract
Real time image zoom is obtained by sampling electrical signals corresponding to reflected ultrasonic waves at a sam pling frequency whereby display data is obtained only in an area of interest. The sampling is delayed to eliminate signals from areas not of interest. Ultrasonic pulse repetition rate is selected so that internal resolution in the area of interest is optimized.
