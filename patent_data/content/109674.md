# Multitrack PCM reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A multitrack PCM reproducing apparatus adapted for reproducing PCM signals recorded on a plurality of tracks in a distributed relation, comprises a signal selector circuit 13 sequentially selecting the PCM signals reproduced from the individual tracks, an A D converter 14 converting the reproduced signals selected by the signal selector circuit into digital signals, a memory circuit 15 storing the digital signals obtained by the A D conversion, a single digital filter 44 47 equalizing for each track the waveform of the digital signals stored in the memory circuit, and a signal processor circuit 6 demodulating the PCM signals on the basis of the digital signals processed by the digital filter.
