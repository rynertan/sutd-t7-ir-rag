# FIBER FOR INSULATING MATERIAL, NON WOVEN FABRIC, WADDING STRUCTURE AND NET LIKE FIBER SHEET

## Abstract
Disclosed is a fiber for a heat insulating material which contains 1 30 wt. of a metal or metal oxide powder and has an emissive power of not more than 0.3 and an average particle size of 1 100 Âµm. The fiber preferably has a flatness of at least 2 in the cross section or is a sheath core type composite fiber, the sheath component containing a larger amount of the metal or metal oxide powder than the core component. The fiber may be used as a non woven fabric or a wadding structure. It also may be used in the form of a net like fiber sheet.
