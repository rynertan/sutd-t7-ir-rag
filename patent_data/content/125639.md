# Porous ceramic thin film and process for preparing the same.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a porous ceramic thin film which comprises applying a solution containing an organimetalic compound and a multifunctional organic compound to a substrate, and thermally decomposing the compounds. The porous ceramic thin film prepared by the process has pores of not more than 10 Âµm in pore size, and is available for materials of various sensors.
