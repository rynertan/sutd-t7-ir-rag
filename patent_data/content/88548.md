# Piezoelectric resonators.

## Abstract
A piezoelectric resonator which resonates in a thickness shear mode comprises a strip shaped resonance chip 3 made of an X cut plate of lithium tantalate crystal and having a rectangular cross section. Electrodes 4,4 are formed at a center portion with respect to the longitudinal direction of the resonance chip on each of its two X plane surfaces. The width of the electrodes is equal to the width of the resonance chip. The longitudinal direction of the resonance chip is inclined with respect to the Y axis by an angle of 50 2 in the anticlockwise direction in the X plane so as to make the longitudinal direction of the resonance chip coincide with the displacement direction of primary oscilla tion of the crystal.
