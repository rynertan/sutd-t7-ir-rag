## Description
CERTAIN OXAZOLINES AS LOAD CARRYING ADDITIVES FOR GEAR OILSDESCRIPTION This invention relates to novel lubricant compositions containing certain oxazolines useful as loadcarrying agents for gear oils. This invention provides a lubricant composition comprising a major amount of an oil of lubricating viscosity or greases thereof and a load carrying amount of an additive selected from the group consisting of a naphthenyl oxazoline or an alkenylsuccinyl mono or bis oxazoline. The oxazoline employed in the present invention is a naphthenyl oxazoline or an alkenylsuccinyl mono or bisoxazoline. The naphthenyl oxazoline is prepared by reacting equimolar amounts of naphthenic acid and tris hydroxymethyl aminoethane. The alkenylsuccinyl mono or bis oxazoline is made by reacting one mole of an alkenylsuccinic acid having 10 carbon atoms to 50 carbon atoms per alkenyl group with 1 or 2 moles of tris hydroxymethyl aminoethane. The reactions are carried out at a temperature between about 2000C and about 25O0C, preferably using an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as benzene or toluene, to remove water by azeotropic distillation through a water take off trap, e.g. a DeanStark trap. The lubricant compositions of the present invention contain a small amount of the aforementioned additive sufficient to improve load carrying properties. General , for most applications, the additive is present in an amount from about 0.1 to about 5 by weight and preferably in an amount from about 0.1 to about 1 by weight. The lubricants may comprise any materials that normally exhibit insufficient antiwear properties. A field of specific applicability is the improvement of liquid hydrocarbon oils boiling within the range from about 750 F to about 10000F. The lubricant oils used may be of any suitable lubricating viscosity range from about 45 SSU at 1000F to about 6000SSU at 1000F and, preferably, from about 50 to 250 SSU at 2100F.These oils having viscosity indexes from about 70 to about 95 are preferred. The average molecular weights of these oils may range from about 250 to about 800. In general, the lubricant may comprise any mineral or synthetic oil of lubricating viscosity. In instances where synthetic oils, or synthetic oils employed as the vehicle for the grease, are desired in preference to mineral oils, or in combination therewith, various compounds of this type may be successfully utilized. Typical synthetic vehicles include polyisobutylene, polybutenes, hydrogenated polydecenes, polypropyiene glycol, polyethylene glycol, trimethylol propane esters, neopentyl and pentaerythritol esters, di 2 ethyl hexyl sebacate, di 2 ethyl hexyl adipate, dibutyl phthalate, fluorocarbons, silicate esters, silar.es, esters of phosphorus containing acids, liquid ureas, ferrocene derivatives, hydrogenated mineral oils, cain type polyphenyls, siloxanes and silicones polysiloxanes , alkyl substituted diphenyl ethers typified by a butyl substituted bis p phenoxy phenyl ether, peroxy phenylethers, etc. The aforementioned additives may be incorporated as antiwear agents in grease compositions.Such oils can also include hydraulic oils, if so desired. When high temperature stability is not a requirement of the finished grease, mineral oils having a viscosity of at least 40 SSU at 1500F, and particularly those falling within the range from about 60 SSU to about 6000 SSU at 1000F may be employed. The lubricating vehicles of the improved greases of the present invention, containing the above described additives, are combined with a grease forming quantity of a thickening agent. For this purpose, a wide variety of materials may be dispersed in the lubricating vehicle in grease forming quantities in such degree as to impart to the resulting grease composition the desired consistency.Exemplary of the thickening agents that may be employed in the grease formulation are non soap thickeners,such as surface modified clays and silicas, aryl ureas calcium complexes and similar materials. In general, grease thickeners may be employed which do not melt and dissolve when used at the required temperature within a particular environment however, in all other respects, any material which is normally employed for thickening or gelling hydrocarbon fluids or forming greases can be used in preparing the improved greases. The following examples illustrate the present invention. Example 1 A mixture of 300 grams 1.0 mol naphthenic acid and 121 grams 1.0 mol tris hydroxymethylamino methane was refluxed in the presence of toluene diluent at about 215cm until evolution of water ceased. The product is a naphthenyl oxazoline. Example 2 A mixture of 185 grams 0.5 mol isooctadecenyl succinic acid and 121 grams 1.0 mol tris hydroxymethylamino methane was refluxed in toluene at a temperature of about 250cm until evolution of water ceased. The product is an isooctadecenyl succinyl bis oxazoline. Example 3 A mixture of 900 grams 1.0 mol of C18 24 dimer alkenylsuccinic anhydride and 121 grams 1.0 mol tris hydroxymethylamino methane was refluxed in toluene to a temperature of about 240 C until evolution of water ceased. The product is an alkenylsuccinyl mono oxazoline. The Timken Load Test Compositions according to the present invention were tested in the Timken Load Test. This test is a known test used to determine the load carrying properties of additives in lubricating oil compositions.The test is conducted by placing a steel test cup on a shaft which can be rotated at 800 rpm. Just below the, cup in contact with it is a small stationary steel block. A load is placed on these parts by means of a lever arm which pushes the block upwards against the rotating cup, which acts as a roller bearing, while the lubricant flows between the two surfaces. The load is gradually increased at 10 minute intervals until failure occurs. Failure is determined by visual inspection during the running period. The additives were blended in a conventionally refined mineral oil containing a sulfurized hydrocarbon, metal passivator, pour point depressant, antioxidant, demulsifier, antirust agent and defoamant. The results of the Timken OK Load Test are as follows Additive Cone Load in lbsBase oil blend 0 50 Example 1 0.1 60 Example 2 0.1 60 Example 3 0.1 60
