## Description
APPARATUS FOR CUTTING AND OR WELDING LAMINAR THERMOPIASTICS MATERIAL The present invention is concerned with apparatus for cutting and or welding laminar thermoplastics material. The invention is particularly concerned with apparatus for longitudinally cutting and or welding an elongate web made of such material. Plastics film material, for example, high density and low density polyethylene films, are commonly made by extrusion in the form of a continuous tube of the film. Extrusion machines for forming film in this way are well known. In the extrusion process, hot film material in a plastic state is extruded from an annular die in a continuous tube and is then expanded in a bubble to an increased diameter of tube before the material of the film sets. The expanded set tube of film is then collapsed to form a double layer continuous strip or web of predetermined width. The web is then usually collected on a roller. It is sometimes convenient to slit the layers of the web longitudinally before the web is rolled up. Hitherto this has been done with fixed blades slitting the moving web during the extrusion process. However, such fixed blades do not always perform satisfactorily. They become fouled and can snag on the web producing poor quality edges to the cuts, or even damaging and making unusable the entire extruder output. The alignment of the knife is critical and it requires frequent cleaning and replacement or sharpening Furthermore, it will be appreciated that slitting a collapsed tubular web produces two webs of half the width but each joined along only one edge, the original outside edge. According to the present invention, apparatus for longitudinally cutting and or welding an elongate web made of laminar thermoplastics material, comprises a work station, means for transporting the web longitudinally through the work station, a laser, means to direct radiation from the laser on to one face of the web at said work station to cut and or weld the material of the web, a roller mounted forsrotation at said work station on an axis perpendicular to the direction of transport of the web and arranged to make intimate contact with the other face of the web at least in a region where the laser radiation is directed on to said one face of the web and to roll with the web with substantially no sliding contact, at least the surface portion of the roller which in use makes contact with said region being formed of a material having a high coefficient of absorption for the wavelength of the radiation from the laser, a low thermal diffusivity and good resistance to thermal shock. It can be seen that with this apparatus, the region of the web which is exposed to the laser radiation, is continuously backed and in intimate contact with said material of the surface portion of the roller as the web is being transported through the work station. This arrangement has been found markedly to increase the efficiency with which the laser energy is utilised in the cutting and or welding operations. A commonly used powerful laser which is especially convenient for the present invention, is one using carbon dioxide gas as the lasing medium The radiation emitted by such carbon dioxide lasers has a wavelength of 10.6 tom. Unfortunately most thermoplastics materials, including polyethylene, do not have absorption bands in this region of their spectra.Thus, operations using such a laser on thin sheets of polyethylene are difficult to carry out efficiently because a relatively small proportion of the radiated energy is absorbed in the sheet of material. lVith the arrangement of the present inventian, the laser energy which is transmitted through the web of the mrolastics material is absorbed in said material having a high coefficient of absorption. The energy absorbed in said material is then transmitted back into the thermoplastics material and greatly improves the efficiency of welding or cutting.It has been found that with a suitable choice of backing material, the same welding or cutting operations can be performed on polyethylene sheet material with cne third of the laser p er necessary without the absorbent backing material. The use of a backing material having the above referred properties of absorption, diffusivity and thermal shock resistance has been suggested previously in the specification of United Kingdan Patent No.1528452. However that specification is concerned primarily with the mEking of bags from the plastics film material and no particular structure or arzangement is disclosed for forming a longitudinal cut or weld in a moving elongate web of laminar thermoplastics material. The mechanism involved in re directing or transmitting the laser energy into the thermoplastics web is not yet fully understood. It is thought to include either direct conductive heat transfer from the backing member into the web of material or re radiation of energy from the material of the roller at a shorter wavelength which is more readily absorbed in the plastics material, or to be a mixture of these processes. It has been found essential for obtaining the improvement in efficiency to ensure that there is good intimate contact between the laminar plastics material and the backing material of the roller. The absorb ant material of the roller should have a low thermal diffusivity so that the region exposed to laser radiation heats up rapidly and the energy profile of the beam incident on the web and roller is not lost before the desired cutting and or welding operation is completed. On the other hand, the material of the roller should cool to below the melting point of the thermoplastics material of the web before the roller completes one revolution to bring a previously heated region of the roller is brought again into contact with the web. These two requirements set the limits for the thermal diffusivity.The coefficient of absorption of the material for the laser wavelength used should be sufficiently high for substantially all the laser energy transmitted through the plastics web and incident upon the material to be absorbed in the surface region thereof, say, within a depth of some 2 mm. Other properties required for the absorbent material of the roller are that it should not decompose at the temperatures involved, typically 19000C where polyethylene is the thermoplastics material, and that it should be capable of withstanding the mechanical stresses involved in repeated cycling between this temperature and approximately 1000cm Said material of the roller may be a siliceous re fractory material, such as fused silica or quartz, or possibly a glass ceramic material. Preferably, said radiation directing means is arranged to form a line focus on the web at the work station with the line extending in the direction of transport of the web. If such a line focus is tapered at at least one end, the radiation can simultaneously cut through the laminar thermoplastics material over the roller and also weld together two layers of the material adjacent the cut. The apparatus of the present invention when applied to tube material from a typical extruder, forms two smaller tubes from one single tube by cutting and welding the tube longitudinally. Preferably, the roller is located and arranged so that web is deviated thereby sufficiently to be in intimate contact therewith over a circumferential distance greater than the longitudinal extent along the web of the incident laser radiation. Further, by ensuring the roller causes the web to deviate along its length by a predetermined amount, tension in the web pulls the web into firm intimate contact with the roller and especially said surface portion thereof formed of the radiation absorbing material. Conveniently, the roller has a uniform diameter over substantially the full width of web to support the web uniformly across its width. It will be appreciated that typical thermoplastics material used in such webs can easily be stretched permanently if the material is rolled over a nonuniform roller. The stretched web then tends to become creased when rolled up on the storage spindle and is unsuitable for use in subsequent processes such as bag making. However, the roller may have at least one axially extending circumferential gap in its supporting surface adjacent said surface portion whereby. web material bridging the gap tends to be distorted radially into the gap and thereby to exert an axial tensioning force on the web material contacting said surface portion of the roller. This axial tensioning force helps to pull out any minor creases or crinkles in the web material as it passes over said surface portion of the roller thereby ensuring that the web material is continuously in good intimate contact with the radiation absorbing material of the roller in the region of the incident radiation. Provided the axial gap in the roller is fairly narrow, for example, between 0.2 cm and 2 cm wide, the gap produces an insignificant permanent distortion of the material web and does not therefore affect its subsequent usefulness. Conveniently, the roller has two said gaps. on opposite sides of said surface portion. In one arrangement, at least said surface portion of the roller is force cooled, i.e. is cooled positively by forced circulation of a cooling medium. The roller may be hollow at least under said surface portion and may then be water cooled internally. The apparatus preferably includes gas jet means arranged to direct a gas jet on to said one face of the web immediately in front of the area of incidence of the laser radiation.This gas jet serves two purposes. One purpose is to disperse any smoke arising from cutting and or welding the thermoplastics material of the web which might otherwise obscure the incident laser radiation. The other purpose is to assist further in smoothing out the thermoplastics web on the surface of the supporting roller immediately in front of the area of incidence of the laser radiation. Preferably said gas jet is fan shaped in a plane perpendicular to the direction of transport of the web with the centre of the fan substantially in line with the centre of the area of incidence of laser radiation. An example of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which FIGURE 1 illustrates apparatus embodying the present invention viewed along the axis of rotation of the roller of the appratus FIGURE 2 is a further partial view of the apparatus ofFIGURE 1 looking along the axis of the laser beam impinging on the plastics web material FIGURE 3 is a detailed view partially in cross section of the roller of the apparatus of FIGURES 1 and 2 illustrating the surface portion thereof formed of the laser radiation absorbing material FIGURE 4 illustrates the shape of the focus of the laser radiation on the plastics web material being cut and or welded FIGURE 5 illustrates in detail the form of a fan shaped gas jet directed at the plastics material and FIGURE 6 illustrates the electrical control and interlock circuitry for the laser of the apparatus. Referring to FIGURES 1 and 2, an elongate plastics film web 10 is fed into a box 11. The web 10 may typically comprise polyethylene film and may be fed to the box 11 directly from an extruder not shown for forming the film. In one example, the plastics material is high density polyethylene film formed on the extruder as a tube which is then collapsed to form the web 10 with two superimposed layers joined together along the longitudinal edges of the web. The web 10 is fed under tension over three rollers 12, 13 and 14 mounted for rotation inside the box 11. The rollers 12, 13 and 14 extend substantially the full width of the web 10 and are substantially uniform axially over the full width.The web 10 is supported by the rollers so as to be transported inside the box 11 in the direction of arrows 23 over each roller in turn and then to leave the box 11 by an exit aperture 15. The central roller 13 is mounted for rotation symmetrically between the roller 12 and 14 and has a larger diameter than rollers 12 and 14. The roller 13 is mounted substantially mid way in the box 11 behind a transparent, typically perspex, window 16 in a front face 17 of the box. As shown in FIGURE 2, the roller 13 is formed of a plurality of axial sections.In the present example, the roller 13 has a section 18 mid way along its length which has its cylindrical surface 19 made of a siliceous refractory material, e. g. quartz. Thus, as the film web 10 is transported through the box 11 past the central roller 13 the part across the width of the web which engages the central section 18 of the roller comes into contact with the quartz surface 19. The rollers 12 and 14 are arranged relative to roller 13 so that the web 10 is deviated along its length by the roller 13 so that the web is in contact with the surface 19 over a finite circumferential distance 20 around the roller. The rollers 12, 13 and 14 are inter connected with one another by belts 21 and 22 to ensure that all three rollers in contact with the web 10 rotate at corresponding speeds to minimise any slippage between the roller 13 and the web 10.In the present example, the rollers 12, 13 and 14 are driven by movement of the web 10 itself through the box 11. It will be appreciated that the web 10 emerging from the box through the aperture 15 is fed to a collecting roll not shown which is driven to haul the web through the box 11. Where the web 10 is derived directly from an extruder, the haul off on the collecting roll is also effective to draw the molten plastics material from the extruder die and through the extruding machine. A laser is provided mounted in a box 25 FIGURE 2 .The laser is preferably a carbon dioxide laser such as that manufactured by Ferranti under the designation MF400. In the example illustrated in FIGURES 1 and 2, the apparatus is mounted on an extruding machine for producing the polyethylene film web 10. The laser is mounted on the extruding machine on a pallet 26 at a position above the roller box 11. Radiation from the laser is emitted directed downwards into a guide tube arrangement 27. The guide tube arrangement 27 comprises a number of axially extendable sleeve sections 28, 29 and 30 interconnected by elbow assemblies 31, 32 and 33. Each elbow assembly has a plane mirror for reflecting the laser radiation through 900.Thus, the laser radiation from the laser 25 first enters the tube section 28, is reflected successively in the mirrors of elbow assemblies 31 and 32 and then passes along the tube section 29 to be reflected again through 900 in the elbow assembly 33 into the tube section 30.The e arrangement 27 is arranged to conduct the laser radiation from the output head of the laser to direct the laser beam through an aperture provided in the window 16 of the roller box 11 at the film web 10 where it travels over the qUartz surface 19 of the central roller portion 18. As will be described in more detail later, the laser energy is arranged to be focused on to the film web 10 supported by the quartz surface 19 so as to cut through the web as the web is transported over the roller. At the same time, the geometry of the focus of the laser radiation can be arranged as will be apparent to weld together the two layers of the film web along the cut edges, thereby forming two smaller tubular webs from the original single tubular web 10. The conducting assembly 27 for the laser radiation is adjustable to allow the height of the focus of the laser beam on the plastics web over the roller 13 to be adjusted and also the position of the focus axially on the centre portion 18 of the roller. Furthermore, the overall path length for the laser radiation from the laser head to the point of incidence on the film web 10 can be adjusted so as to adjust the area of the focus on the film and the resulting radiation power density. As mentioned orevioushs, a substantialprmoPion of the iaser radiation emitted by a carbon dioxide laser at 10.6 o m. is not absorbed by a relatively thin film of high density polyethylene material. However, the radiation from the laser, passing through the film is absorbed in the surface layers of the quartz surface 19 of the central roller portion 18. It has been found that providing such a quartz backing surface to the polyethylene film when cutting or welding by a carbon dioxide laser greatly increases the efficiency with which the laser energy can be utilised.For example, it has been found that the same cutting or welding operations can be carried out with only one third of the laser power needed in the absence of a quartz backing material. By providing quartz backing material on the roller section 18 which rotates as the film web to be cut and welded is transported, a good contact can be maintained between the web in the area of incidence of the laser energy and the quartz surface of the roller section, without any sliding contact between the two.In this way, the advantages of providing the quartz backing material can be used to provide a longitudinal cut and or welded seal on a continuously running web of polyethylene film. FIGURE 3 illustrates the arrangement of rollers in the box 11 in greater detail and particularly shows in crosssection the central portion 18 of the roller 13. In FIGURE 3 only a left hand end of the rollers 12, 13 and 14 is illustrated.However, it will be appreciated that the portion 18 as illustrated in FIGURE 3 is in fact central along the length of the complete roller 13. The rollers 12 and 14 are of substantially the same length as the roller 13 and should be slightly longer than the width of the material web 10 to be transported through the box 11. The central portion 18 of the roller 13 is formed of an ozen ended hollow cylinder 40 of quartz. The wall thickness of the quartz cylinder 40 is not critical, but it should be large enough to provide sufficient mechanical strength for the cylinder 40 and also to ensure that all laser radiation incident on the outside surface 19 of the cylinder is absorbed.The cylinder 40 is mounted between a pair of circular endplates 41. Elastomeric O ring seals 42 are provided between the annular end faces of the cylinder 40 and the opposing inner faces of each endplate 41. To locate the O ring seals 42, the annular end faces of the cylinder 40 are machined to provide an annular groove. Similarly, the inner faces of the plates 41 have an opposing annular groove. The seal 42 is omitted in FIGURE 3 at 43 to illustrate the shape of the grooves in the opposing faces of the cylinder 40 and endplate 41. The annular groove in the endplate 41 may be of circular section. However, it is more convenient to form the corresponding groove in the annular faces of the cylinder 40 with a rectangular section since this is easier to machine in the quartz material of the cylinder.The seals 42 are seated in the grooves and the two endplates 41 are drawn together by means of a plurality of drawbars 44 distributed symmetrically about the axis of the cylinder 40 and extending axially between the plates 41 to hold the plates together. The drawbars 44 pull the plates 41 together sufficiently to ensure that there is a good fluid tight seal between the plates 41 and the cylinder 40, but to avoid any direct mechanical contact between the quartz of the cylinder 40 and the material, typically stainless steel, of the plates 41.In this way any differential expansion between the plates 41 and the cylinder 40 when the complete roller portion 18 is heated, can be absorbed bydeformation of the O ring seals 42 without excessively stressing the quartz cylinder 40. The central roller portion 18 is mounted on a shaft 45 which is rotatably mounted in bearings 46 in sidewalls 47 of the roller box 11. The roller portion 18 is fastened to the shaft 45 by means of locking nuts 48 which ensure a good fluid tight seal between the plates 41 and the shaft 45. On either side of the central roller portion 18, extension portions 50 and 51 are also mounted on the shaft 45. The extension portions 50 and 51 are formed with an exterior cylindrical surface typically of stainless steel and have substantially the same diameter as the central portion 18. The axial length of the complete roller 13 including central portion 18 and extension portions 50 and 51 is made slightly greater than the width of the plastics web to be handled by the machine. As illustrated in FIGURE 3, an axial gap 52 is left between the adjacent ends of the central portion 18 and each extension portion 50. This axial gap 52 extends around the periphery of the external surface of the complete roller 13 so that the web material supported by the roller 13 must bridge the gap 52 on either side of the central portion 18. It has been found that these gaps 52 cause the longitudinal tension of the web 10 passing over the roller 13 to cause the web material bridging the gaps to be drawn slightly radially inwards into the gap 52. This radially inward movement in turn produces a tensioning of the web material axially along the roller 13 on either side of each gap 52. This axial tensioning, across the width of the web 10, assists in removing any crinkles in the portion of the web passing over the quartz surface 19 of the roller 18 thereby ensuring good intimate contact between the web and the surface 19. The size of the gap 52 is not critical. A very small gap will have an insignificant effect, whereas if the gap is too large excessive stretching of the plastics film material is caused which renders the film unusable in subsequent processing, e.g. bag making.Gap widths between 0.2 cm and 2 cm are feasible and in a preferred arrangement gap widths of 1 cm are used on a roller 13 of diameter 60 cm. FIGURE 3 also illustrates in more detail, the arrangement of belts 21 and 22 interconnecting the rollers 12, 13 and 14.A double pulley 55 is provided mounted on the shaft 45 at the end of the roller 13 and the first belt 21 links the pulley 55 with the upper roller 12, whereas the second belt 22 links the pulley with the lower shaft 14. As shown in FIGURE 1, the belts 21 and 22 are tensioned by resp ive idler sult 56. A rotation sensor 57 is also mounted inside the box 11 with a sensing wheel 58 engaging the outer surface of the belt 22.The rotation sensor 57 operates to provide a signal on lines 59 when the roller 13 with pulley 15 is rotating. This rotation signal is used in the control circuitry of the laser apparatus as will be described later. Referring now to FIGURE 4, the profile 60 of the focus of the laser beam pin the plastics film material is illustrated.The focus is a substantially line focus with its axis along the direction of transport of the film as indicated by an arrow 61. The line focuscan be produced by any known technique but is conveniently formed in the described example by using a cylindrical mirror in the elbow assembly 33. The axis of the cylinder of the mirror in the elbow 33 is arranged in the plane of the direction of transport of the film so as to focus the laser beam laterally, i.e. transversely of the direction of transport into the line of focus. By adjusting the distance between the elbow assembly 33 and the film web by means of the sleeve 30, the beam can be focused to a sharp point or edge at one end 62 of the line focus, whereas the other end is relatively rounded in profile. With the elongate focus profile as illustrated, the laser can be used to cut right through the layers of the film web along the centre line of the line focus where the film is exposed to a maximum total amount of energy during passage through the focus. Thus, a cut 63 is formed in the two layers of film. Immediately adjacent the cut edges of the film, the film material is exposed to a relatively lesser amount of energy but sufficient to weld the two layers of the film together as illustrated by welds 64. In a preferred example, the focus 60 has a length of about 1.5 Cm and a maximum width of between 1.5 and 2 mm. The focus eros at the pointed end 62 to a maximum width of about .25 mm. Referring again to FIGURE 1, a gas jet 70 is mounted immediately adjacent the exit aperture 81 of the sleeve 30sphere the laser beam enters the box 11. The jet 80 is connected to a source of compressed air not shown in FIGURE 1 and is arranged to direct a jet of air at the film web 10 where it engages the quartz surface 19 of the roller 13. As illustrated in FIGURE 5, the jet 80 is arranged to produce a fan shaped jet of air in a plane substantially perpendicular to the direction of transport of the film, and to the axis of the line focus 60.The fan is centered perpendicularly on the axis of the line focus 60 and serves to blow or press the film on to the surface 19 of the roller immediately in front of the focus. The profile of the gas jet impinging on the film is illustrated at 82 inFIGURE 4. In the described example, the jet impinges on the film material about 1 mm in front of the sharp edge 62 of the focus Referring now to FIGURE 6, electrical control circuitry for the laser is illustrated. The control circuitry includes an isolating switch 90 which closes to energise a first relay R1 if three sensor switches 91, 92 and 93 are closed. Switches 91 and 92 are interlock switches provided on the extruding machine with which the laser cutting and welding apparatus is being used.The interlocks are closed only if the extruding machine is operating correctly producing the film web 10.The third switch 93 is responsive to the rotation sensor 57 and is closed only if the roller 13 is rotating, indicating that web 10 is being transported over the roller ready for cutting and welding by the laser. When relay R1 is energised, a relay R2 can be energised by depressing a start button 94. Relay R2 has one set of contacts R2 in naralBitJith the start button 94 to hold the relay on when energised. The relay R2 can be de energised subsequently by depressing a stop button 95. The relay R2 has a second set of contacts R2 2 which are connected to operate the high tension interlock of the laser to supplyH.T. voltage to the laser to begin the lasing action. However, the laser of the present ei mentlls has ashutter arrangement comprising a calorimeter which can be moved into the output beam of the laser to absorb and dissipate the energy of the beam. A second start button 96 energises a third relay R3 which again has one set of contacts R3 1 arranged to hold the relay on when energised. On energising relay R3,a second set of its contacts R3 2 are energised to operate a calorimeter interlock in the laser apparatus which opens the laser shutter or removes the calorimeter from the laser beam. The beam can then emerge from the laser box 25 along the guide arrang nent 27 to start the cutting and welding process. The beam can be shut off by depressing STOP button 97 to de energise relay R3. Relay R3 may also be arranged to operate warning lights positioned on the apparatus to indicate that the laser is firing. In the arrangement described above, a single longitudinal cut is made producing two smaller tubes of film from one wide web 10. However the apparatus can be modified to produce two or more longitudinal parallel cuts and or welds simultaneously, thereby forming three or more tubes from one original film tube. A single laser may be employed with its beam split into two or more separate beams incident on the film web. Separate axial portions of the roller 13 may be provided with quartz surfaces to back the film web behind each incident laser beam.
