# Apparatus for driving a polyphase brushless motor with a suppressed torque ripple.

## Abstract
An apparatus for driving a polyphase brushless mo tor with a resulting torque ripple effectively suppressed. The apparatus comprises a rotor position sensor 71 73 , a controller 8 responsive to the output of the sensor for generating a control signal and an inverter 4 serv ing to conduct electric current to each phase of the mo tor as a result of commutation under control of the control signal from the controller. The controller is particularly provided with a device 88 for increasing the value of integration of the electric current for each phase U, V, W of the motor with respect to time as measured from the instant of switching among motor phase currents effected with the control signal.
