# Active load circuit.

## Abstract
An active load circuit comprising a current mirror circuit providing a load to a differential amplifier, an output transistor Q₄ providing an amplified signal in response to the differential input to the differential amplifier Q₅, Q₆ , and a constant current source CS₁ . The current mirror circuit includes a pair of load transistors Q₁, Q₂ and a third transistor Q₃ provided for improving the circuit stability and the amplification factor of the circuit. The collector of the output transistor is connected to the emitter of the third transistor so as to further improve the circuit stability and the amplification factor.
