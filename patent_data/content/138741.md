# Temperature indicating sheet.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a temperature indicat ing sheet which, when exposed to temperatures higher than the prescribed temperature in temperature control for the common low temperature preserved goods, changes in col or according to the exposure temperature and time. This object is attained by arranging one component which melts at the prescribed temperature and the other component which irreversibly changes in color in contact with said com ponent through a membrane permeable to the both com ponents. The sheet of the present invention comprises a component A which melts at the prescribed temperature, a substance B which changes in color in contact with the com ponent A and a membrane permeable to the molten com ponent A , said component A being included in microcap sules which can be broken by outer pressure at a tem perature used, and in which the component A and the sub stance B are arranged at the opposite sides with respect to the membrane.
