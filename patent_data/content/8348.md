# A method of etching a surface.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of etching surfaces such as silicon dioxide, silicon nitride and silicon carbide by exposing the surface simultaneously to a noble gas halide such as fluorinated xenon compound and radiation such as electron beam radiation. The etch rate of silicon dioxide achieved by the present invention, is about 200 angstroms per minute.
