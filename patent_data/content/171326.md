# Self lighting security hang up device.

## Abstract
The present invention is related to a hang up device of the type comprising a metallic suspension rail and hooking on sliders. It is characterized in that it comprises at least two elec trically conductive rails 1, 2 supplied with low voltage cur rent and isolated from each other, on which rails sliders 3 6 are mounted that ensure the isolation between the rails, at least one of them 3 being provided with two arms 25, 26 one end of which is hingedly connected to said slider or sli ders 3 , while the other one carries a light carrying hous ing 27 , at least two conductive arms 25, 26 being electri cally connected each, on the slider side, to one of the rails 1, 2 and on the other side to the housing 27 , thus ensuring the supply of the light carrying housing with low voltage current.
