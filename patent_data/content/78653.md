# Angle modulation circuit.

## Abstract
In a circuit for angularly modulating a composite video signal SG1 by means of a variable frequency oscillator VCO , a desired frequency deviation of modulated video signal can be easily set. Namely the width fo frequency deviation and the lower limit frequency of the angularly modulated video signal can be set independently from each other. Only the oscillation frequeny changes with a variation of the value of resistors R₂ while the width of frequency deviation makes no variation. The width fo frequency deviation changes when the value of the resistor R₃ is varied.
