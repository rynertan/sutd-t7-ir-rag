## Description
THERMOPLASTIC RESINOUS BLEND HAVING AN IMPROVED IMPACT PERFORMANCE FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a blend of thermoplastic polymer resins and more particularly to a modified blend comprising thermoplastic polyester, polycarbonate and a graft copolymer. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A thermoplastic blend comprising a C1 C4 alkylene terephthalate , a polycarbonate resin and an elastomeric based graft copolymer was found to have significantly improved impact properties upon the admixing therewith an additive amount of a modifying oil. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Since they were first commercialized, ABS graft polymers have been found useful in a variety of applications. However, for some applications, notably those related to the field of transportation, ABS is often regarded to be deficient in terms of its gasoline resistance. Blends of ABS and polycarbonate resins were disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,130,177 and 3,852,393 and although found suitable for many end uses, the levels of impact resistance and gasoline resistance presented a drawback for some important markets. Similar blends are disclosed in British Patent 1,253,226 whereas U.S.Patent 3,162,695 is noted for its teaching respecting a blend of polycarbonate and a graft copolymer of methylmethacrylate and styrene monomers polymerized in the presence of a butadiene styrene latex. Further noted is U.S. 3,864,428 wherein taught are compositions comprising an aromatic polyester, a csy rbonate and a graft copolymer of butadiene.Other art serving in providing the background to the present invention is U.S. 4,096,202 teaching compositions comprising thermoplastic polyesters and impact modifiers based on an acrylate based elastomer, and 4,299,928 wherein taught are compositions comprising polycarbonate and an acrylate based elastomer.

The polycarbonates of the invention may entail in their structure units derived from one or more of the suitable bisphenols. Among the resins suitable in the practice of the invention are included phenolphthalein based polycarbonate copolycarbonates and terpolycarbonates such as are described in U.S. Patents 3,036,036 and 4,210,741, both incorporated by reference herein. The polycarbonates of the invention may also be branched by incorporating small quantities of polyhydroxyl compounds in them by condensation, e.g., 0.05 2.0 mol based on the quantity of bisphenols used . Polycarhonates of this type have been described, for example, in German Offenlegungsschriften 1,570,533 2,116,974 and 2,113,347 British Patents 885,442 and 1,079,821 and U.S. Patent 3,544,514.The following are some examples of polyhydroxyl compounds which may be used for this purpose phloroglucinol 4,6 dimethyl 2,4,6 tri 4 hydroxyphenyl heptane 2 4,6 dimethyl 2, 4,6 tri 4 hydroxyphenyl heptane 1,3,5 tri 4 hydroxyphenyl benzene 1,1, 1 tri 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane tri 4 hydroxyphenyl phenyl methane 2,2 bis 4,4 4,4 dihydroxydiphanyl cyclo hexyl propane 2,4 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 4 isopropyl phenol 2,6 2 dihydroxy 5 methylbenzyl 4 methylphenol 2,4 dihydroxybenzoic acid 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 2,4 dihydroxyphenyl propane and 1,4 bis 4 ,4 dihydroxytriphenylmethyl benzene.Some of the other polyfunctional compounds are 2,4 dihydroxybenzoic acid, trimesic acid, cyanuric chloride and 3,3 bis 4 hydroxy phenyl 2 oxo 2, 3 dihydroindole. In addition to the polycondensation process mentioned above and which essentials are described below, other processes for the preparation of the polycarbonates of the invention are polycondensation in a homogeneous phase and transesterification. The suitable processes are disclosed in the incorporated herein by reference U.S. Patents 3,028,365 2,999,846 3,248,414 3,153,008 3,215,668 3,187,065 2,064,974 2,070,137 2,991,273 and 2,000,835. The preferred process is the interfacial polycondensation process. According to the interfacial polycondensation process, copolycarbonate resins are obtained by reacting the aromatic dihydroxy compounds with an alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal oxide or hydroxide to form the salt of the hydroxy compounds.The salt mixture is present in an aqueous solution or suspension and is reacted with phosgene, carbonyl bromide or bischloroformic esters of the aromatic dihydroxy compounds. An organic solvent is provided in the reaction admixture which is a solvent for the polymer but not for the aromatic dihydroxy salts.Thus, chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons or chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons are used as the organic solvent which dissolves the condensation product. In order to limit the molecular weight one may use monofunctional reactants such as monophenols, for example, the propyl , isopropyl and butylphenols, especially p tertbutylphenol and phenol itself. In order to accelerate the reaction, catalysts such as tertiary amines, quaternary ammoniun, phosphoniuin or arsonium salts and the like may be used. The reaction temperature should be about 200C to 1500C, preferably 0 to about 1000C. According to the polycondensation process in a homogeneous phase, the dissolved reaction components are polycondensed in an inert solvent in the presence of an equivalent amount of a tertiary amine base required for absorption of the generated HC1 such as, e.g., N,N dimethylaniline, N,N dimethyl cyclohexylamine or, preferably, pyridine and the like. In still another process, a diaryl carbonate can be transesterified with the aromatic dihydroxy compounds to form the polycarbonate resin. It is to be understood that it is possible to combine in the processes described above in a chenically meaningful way, both the aromatic dihydroxy compounds and the monohydroxy compounds in the form of the alkali metal salts and or bis haloformic acid esters and the amount of phosgene or carbonyl bronide then still required in order to obtain high molecular products. Other methods of synthesis in forming the polycarbonates of the invention such as disclosed inU.S. Patent 3,912,688, incorporated herein by reference, may be used. 3.

In the practice, the blend is preferably first prepared by homogeneously mixing the dry compounds, extruding, pelletizing and molding in accordance with methods well known in the art. In cases where the modifier is in liquid form it is preferred to first blend the dry solid components and tnen to introduce the liquid component just prior to the extrusion. The compositions of the present invention may contain the customary and known additives including antioxidants, thermal stabilizers and nucleating agents, as well as fillers, reinforcing agents, colorants, flame retardants and mold release agents and lubricants.
