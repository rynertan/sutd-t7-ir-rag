# Reagent for quantitative determination of microorganisms.

## Abstract
An agent for quantitative determination of microorgan isms comprises a an antibody prepared from a strain of the same species as the species of microorganisms to be determined, b an insolubilized cell component of a strain which can sufficiently bind to the antibody a but does not release and replace other strains which have been bound with the antibody a , and c a labelled second antibody. Quantitative determination of the microorganisms can be carried out by i adding a predetermined amount of component a to a test sample, which component a is present in excess, to cause an antigen antibody reaction, ii adding component b for reaction thereof with the un reacted antibody, iii separating the precipitated antigen antibody complex, iv adding component c , v washing the mixture and vi measuring the activity of labelled substance in the complex. The agent and method of the present invention are useful for determining simultaneously not only a strain from which the antibody is prepared but also other strains of the same species which are contained in the test sample.
