# Aggregated polyelectrolytes, their preparation and uses in the fractionation of blood and other proteinaceous substances.

## Abstract
The invention relates to polyelectrolytes and their use in the fractionation of blood and other proteinaceous substances. The filterability, drying characteristics and physical form of water insoluble, cross linked polyelectrolytes containing amine imide functional groups are employed without substantially diminishing the protein adsoprtion capacity of said polyelectrolytes by heating the polymeric starting material in inert organic solvent at a temperature ranging from about 115 C to about 160 C but lower than the softening point of said polymer for at least about 15 minutes and until said polymer is substantially aggregated prior to crosslinking.
