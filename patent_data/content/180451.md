# DISPENSER FOR SOLUBLE MATERIAL

## Abstract
A dispenser 1 for soluble materials takes the form of a hol low elongate body fabricated in solvent impermeable material. Soluble material 6 is enclosed in the body which is suspended at its position of use, for example from the ring 3 of a sink drain hole 4. The dispenser 1 has a least one hole 9, preferably at its lower end 8 so that solvent passing over the dispenser is drawn inside by surface tension. Dissolved material can then be released as a drop 10. By selecting the number and size of the holes 9, the rate of release of the soluble material 6 is varied.
