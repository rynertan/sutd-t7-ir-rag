# RIBBON CARTRIDGE WITH SELF CONTAINED RATCHET AND DRIVE GEAR ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A ribbon cartridge having a self contained ratchet assembly and drive gear assembly. Three principal compo nents are provided a drive gear 12, a ratchet gear spool 24 connected by a ring gear 44 formed thereon to the drive gear, and a take up spool 22 having internal teeth which are rotatably mounted on a ratchet 32 formed on the external diameter of the ratchet gear spool 24. The drive gear 12 is driven by a simple printer motor at a constant speed, which, in turn, drives the ratchet gear spool 24 at a constant speed. This action, in turn, drives the take up spool through the flexible plastic ratchet 32 at a speed that varies with the amount of ribbon accumulating on the take up spool.
