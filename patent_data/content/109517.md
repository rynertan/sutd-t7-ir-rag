## Description
The present invention relates to a nuclear magnetic resonance diagnostic apparatus referred to as an NMR hereinafter for imaging as a two dimensional projection image referred to as a scanogram hereinafter a specific nucleus spin density distribution present in an object to be examined, e.g., a patient referred to as a patient , in two directions by using the NMR phenomenon. To obtain a scanogram by means of a conventional diagnostic apparatus utilizing the NMR phenomenon, one dimensional projection data referred to as a PD hereinafter has been used. As is known, the scanogram is utilized to determine which portion of an object such as a diseased portion the NMR images are taken for, before a plurality of the formal NMR images are taken for diagnostic purpose. To obtain the PD, a uniform static magnetic field H₀ is applied to the patient along the z axis, and a linear gradient magnetic field referred to as a linear gradient field G When successive PDs are obtained by continuously changing and projecting the sliced portion, a scanogram SG is obtained as shown in Fig. 3. To realize a satisfactory spatial resolution of the scanogram SG in the longitudinal direction of the patient P, many projections must be performed under the conditions that the slice thickness must be very thin and any space between the adjacent sliced portions must be eliminated. However, in general, a shift of the sliced portion is performed by mechanically moving the patient P in the longitudinal direction Z. As a result, a mechanism of a patient moving device not shown becomes complex. Furthermore, as the level of the FID signal is proportional to the quantity of excited magnetization. The thinner, the slice thickness becomes, the smaller, the FID signal becomes. As a result, a signal to noise ratio referred to as an S N ratio hereinafter is significantly lowered. To improve the S N ratio, the same sliced portion must be repeatedly examined from the same projection direction. As a result, projection time is prolonged, though a PD for only one sliced portion is obtained. Prior art document PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY, Volume 25, May 1980, W. EDELSTEIN et al. Spin warp NMR imaging and application to human whole body imaging pages 751 756, discloses a spin warp NMR imaging apparatus for whole body imaging in which a magnet produces a static field, and a 90 pulse is simultaneously applied with a gradient magnetic field to a body under investigation A narrow band RF pulse is applied to the body along with the application of a magnetic field gradient. In this apparatus, phase encoding is performed in the direction vertical along the static field and not in the longitudinal direction of the patient. It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a diagnostic apparatus by utilizing the nuclear magnetic resonance phenomenon, wherein, no relative mechanical transportation between the object to be examined and the NMR diagnostic apparatus is required to obtain a scanogram of an object to be examined. It is a secondary object of the present invention to provide the NMR diagnostic apparatus in which only a short projection time is required to obtain the scanogram image having a high spatial resolution. These objects may be accomplished by providing a diagnostic apparatus utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance techniques as defined in anyone of claims 1 to 3. The present invention may be best understood with reference to the accompanying drawings in which When the spin density distribution of a specific nucleus present in a patient P is given as f x,y,z , and an RF field generated by a 90 pulse H1 is applied through transmitter coils 2A and 2B, the motion of the net magnetization M in a region V excited by the 90 pulse, for which a scanogram is taken is expressed by the following equation if the relaxation times are negligible. It should be noted that the net magnetization M of a sample e.g., the sliced portion results from summing the individual magnetization vectors referred to as net magnetization M hereinafter . A gradient field G where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the specific nucleus, ℓ is the typical length of the patient P in the longitudinal direction thereof corresponding to the length of the transmitter coils 2A and 2B arranged in the longitudinal direction thereof see Fig. 4 , ξ is any constant indicating an angle radian excluding zero, and n is a variable. When G Individual magnetizations m shown in Fig. 5A tend to incline along the same direction in response to the 90 pulse, as shown in Fig. 5B the rotating field rotates at the angular frequency given by equation 2 . However, when a positive gradient field G When the gradient field G By using the angle , the signal obtained along the z axis i.e., along the longitudinal direction of the patient P can be separated to obtain the scanogram two dimensional projection image . In the same manner as described with the conventional method, when the gradient field G where K is the constant of proportionality. According to equations 1 and 4 , A scanogram Sg x ,Z can be given as follows Equation 6 can be rewritten in accordance with equation 7 as follows The scanogram Sg x ,Z can be obtained by two dimensional Fourier transform of F t,n equation 8 by The FID signal is collected such that the value of ξ in equation 3 is amplified to have a value sufficiently indicating a change of Fd t,n along the nth direction where n is an integer N,..., 2, 1, 0, 1, 2,..., N . The field application method will be summarized with reference to Fig. 6. The linear gradient field G When the NMR or FID signals are collected, therefore, the entire sliced portions for which a scanogram is taken can be excited by the magnetic fields, so that a good S N ratio can be achieved. Accordingly if the signal collection conditions are not changed in case of the present embodiments, it is not necessary to introduce any measure to improve the S N ratio, with the result that the total projection time can be shortened as compared to that of the conventional method. Furthermore, the phase data of the magnetization is used to separate images obtained in the longitudinal direction of the patient P, so that the patient need not be moved with respect to the diagnostic apparatus, thereby obtaining a scanogram which covers a wide area of the patient. Fig. 8 shows a circuit configuration of an apparatus for practicing the NMR measuring method described above. A transmitter unit 10 will first be described. The transmitter unit 10 includes an oscillator not shown to generate an RF pulse H1 having a carrier wave with a center frequency of 4.258 MHz corresponding to a magnetic field of 0.1T 1,000 gauss for a hydrogen nucleus . The RF pulse is amplitude modulated by a SINC function to obtain the RF pulse H1. This RF pulse H1 is applied to a tuner 12. The tuner 12 selects the RF pulse 90 pulse having a specific frequency so as to tune the pulse width which is tuned to a specific nucleus of the patient P, and applies through the probe head coils 3A and 3B the 90 pulse to the given sliced portion to be exited of the patient P. On the other hand, the static field H₀ generated by a magnet 30 is applied to the patient P in a predetermined direction, as previously explained. Under such conditions, the gradient field G The detection, collection and processing of the NMR signals from the patient P will now be described. After an application of the composite gradient fields G These digital signals are supplied to an arithmetic logic unit 26 which performs Fourier transformation and various types of operations as indicated by the equations previously described, thereby obtaining a scanogram. The scanogram is then monitored on a display device 28. According to the present invention, there is provided a diagnostic apparatus by utilizing the nuclear magnetic resonance phenomenon, wherein the spin density distribution of the specific nucleus in the patient can be imaged as a scanogram having a sufficient spatial resolution with respect to the longitudinal direction of the patient without performing a relative mechanical transportation of the patient with respect to the diagnostic apparatus in requiring a short projection time.
