# LATHE TOOL FOR REMOVING AXIAL PERIPHERAL IRREGULARITY FROM SURFACE OF CYLINDRICAL WORKPIECE

## Abstract
A lathe type machine tool for removing axially irregular material from the periphery of a cylindrical or tubular workpiece having a variable peripheral contour on either side of the material to be removed utilizes a chordwise extending set of support arms for a pair of roller guides that are caused to follow eccentricities on the periphery of a workpiece and to provide axially spaced reference points for guiding the cutter element of the tool. The cutter is mounted on a similar chordwise extending support arm that is caused to traverse an imaginary reference line intersecting the aforementioned reference points so that a radially and axially extending irregularity can be removed between the reference points with a smooth transition zone between the reference points. Since the reference points are caused to continuously move around the periphery of the workpiece the cutter removes material from the periphery of the workpiece between the reference points completely around the periphery of the workpiece. A specific system for supporting the guide elements establishing the reference points is described and a specific system for axially advanc ing the tool cutter while the cutter moves along the reference line includes a drive clutch arrangement for selectively reversing movement of the cutter and a lost motion connec tion that permits the cutter to move radially to follow the inclination of the reference line while it is axially advanced along the line by the axial feed drive mechanism.
