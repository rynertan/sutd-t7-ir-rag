# Powder feed pickup device for thermal spray guns.

## Abstract
A powder feeding system for a thermal spray gun provides uniform control of powder feed rate with a minimum of pulsation during operation and without feeding during idle mode. The feeder is comprised of an enclosed hopper 10 for containing a powder 39 to be thermal sprayed, a carrier conduit 15 connected between a carrier gas supply and a thermal spray gun, a feed gas conduit 17 for discharging a regulated supply of feed gas under pressure into the hopper, and one or preferably more powder intake orifices 16 extending from the carrier conduit 15 into the hopper 10 below the normal minimum level of powder. The intake conduits 15, 17 have a geometric design and arrangement such that there is no gravity flow of powder therethrough into a carrier gas stream in the absence of a feed gas flow therethrough. The axes of the intake orifices 16 extend away from the carrier conduit 15 at an acute angle to the axis of the carrier conduit as defined by the direction of carrier gas flow. Preferably there is a constriction in the carrier conduit 15 downstream of the intake orifices 16 .
