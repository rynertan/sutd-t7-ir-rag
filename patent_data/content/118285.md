# INK JET INTERLACE STRATEGY

## Abstract
An improved ink jet recording interlace strategy. Se quentially generated ink droplets directed to a recording medium are first charged and deflected 128 by a uniform electric field. The charge sequence on the droplets is such that the droplets are separated by the electric field as they travel towards a row of pixel locations 1a 42a on the medium thereby reducing electrostatic and aerodynamic interactions between droplets. The separation of droplets conforms to an interlace scheme wherein droplets directed to closely adjacent recording medium locations are sepa rated by a number of droplets whose placement on said medium conforms to a multi level interlace such that the scan direction of the number of droplets is disrupted at least once. In this way, sequentially generated droplets are directed to non sequential pixel locations 1a, 15a, 29a 8a, 22a, 36a 2a, 16a, 30a 9a, 23a, 37a etc. in non sequential interlace portions of the total number of adjacent pixel locations assigned to a particular nozzle.
