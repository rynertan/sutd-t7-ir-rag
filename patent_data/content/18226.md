# Pollution abating, energy conserving glass manufacturing apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus is provided for preconditioning and preheat ing pellets of glass batch prior to heating and melting them in a furnace. Components of glass batch are mixed together and combined with water to form agglomerates, e.g., pellets. These agglomerates are supplied to a hopper 14 through which hot combustion gases are passed and they are preheated to an el evated temperature in the hopper prior to entering the melting furnace, thereby resulting in a savings of substantial amounts of energy. Moisture is removed from the agglomerate prior to their being supplied to the hopper hence, the tendency for the agglomerates to adhere to one another and form aggregates, or clinkers, is substantially controlled. For that purpose, the agglomerates 120 are collected in a preconditioner 94 hav ing a receptable 102 located above the bed 28 of agglomer ates in the hopper 14 with the hot gases also passing through the agglomerates in the receptacle after passing through the bed 28 in the hopper 14 . After moisture is removed, the ag glomerates are dropped from the receptacle 102 onto the bed in the hopper. The agglomerates may be melted in a com bustion fired melter or in an electrically powered melter.
