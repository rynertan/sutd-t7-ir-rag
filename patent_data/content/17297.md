# Cryogenic process for separating synthesis gas.

## Abstract
A cryogenic separation of a feed gas mixture comprising hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane is obtained by partial condensation. The feed gas 111 is partially cooled and condensed, then separated to form first gas and liquid fractions, the latter is separated into carbon monoxide product gas and methane product gas, and the first gas fraction is further cooled for additional partial condensation and separated into a hydrogen enriched gas fraction and a second carbon monoxide rich liquid.
