# Conjugate addition of organocuprates generated from copper I cyanide and vinyl stannanes useful in prostaglandin analog synthesis.

## Abstract
An improved method for the preparation of prostaglan din analogs which comprises preparation of two equivalents of an alkyl or alkenyl lithium reagent in an aprotic solvent mixture such as pentane or hexane and tetrahydrofuran, conversion of said reagent by addition of 1 equivalent of copper I cyanide to a copper reagent, conversion of said copper reagent to the blocked prostaglandin analog by the addition of a 2 alkylcyclopent 2 en 1 one reagent and quen ching of the resultant reaction mixture with aprotic media or an active acylating agent and finally optionally deblocking the resultant product is disclosed. This method is an improvement over previous methods in that more modest temperatures and less hazardous and or less complex rea gents are used and in that for some analogs the method is shorter than previous methods.
