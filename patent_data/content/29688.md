# Digital data transmission systems.

## Abstract
In a receiver arrangement for a quadrature phaseshift digital data transmission system including an adaptive equalising regenerator 8 , a phase control signal for the local oscillator is derived from an output of the regenerator and decision feedback signals within the regenerator are applied by way of balanced current switching circuits 12 24 .
