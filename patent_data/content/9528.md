## Description
Jam Detection System for a Continuous Paper SortingMachine Thie invention relates to shect distributing or sorting davices and more particularly to an apparatus which sorts continuously large numbers of multi page documents and in which a novel and unique jam det ion system is incorporated in the machine controls Reference is made to the following copendilng UnitedStates Patent Applications which are incorporated herein and which are directed to other features of the instant machine in which the jam detection system is incorporated. They are 1. Continuous Paper sorting Machine Serial No. 897,272, filed.April 17, 1978 2. Bir Receiver Mechario n for a Contlrucus Paper Sorting Machine Sorial No. 897,273, filed April 17, 1978 3. Feeding Mechanism for a Continuous Sorting Machine Serial No. 897,274, filed April 17, 1978 and 4. Paper Sheet Deflecting System for Sorter Mechanism Serial No. 897,275, filed April 17, 1978 Prior art paper distributors, sorters and or collÅators have encountered many problems.One is that the large increase in the cost of labor and materials has ad it more imperative that the available press or duplicator capacity be utilized to its fullest. In order for the maxizu volume capability of a printing, duplicating, or copy making machine to be utilizes, it is necessary that the sorter have the capacity to receive tbe printer or copy making machine output without due loss of press or copy making machine time. Areas of lost time vÏuld be those accounted for by faulty or irregular transport of sheet copies and by failure of the controls to detect nonprogrammed occurrences such as sheets counted at entry to feeder but t courted in tower. Others would be paper sheets hanying up at deflector locations, stalling at the entrances to trays and overlapping to name a few of the irregularities. Since there are different types of irregularities which can occur, it is Important that the operator be able to locate the problem or irregularity area for quick clearing of the machine. Those skilled in the art will appreciate the savings in labor, time and money if the output of a printing or copying center is not impaired 4y long shutdowns to hunt for jams. Among the prior art references which may be con sidered with respect to the features of this invention are the following United States Patent Nos. 3,988,018 3,527,406 3,905,594. The devices covered by the above listed patents are considered to be nonanticipatory of the teachings of this invention. Seminary Jam dete tion 5 1 stem for a continuous paper sorting machine, in which t receiver Is comprised of at least two columns of inclined side by side stacks of paper storage trays with entrances for receiving paper sheets from a feeder. The receiver is mounted for lateral moyement relative to the feeder mechanism, such that the tray etrances move past the feecµss4UiZlJz a generally vertically plane. The feeder has an in feed conveyor from a press or duplicator which moves the sheets of paper to a deflector which directs the copies into a proof tray or on into the feeder.The sheets are then fed upwardly or downwardly onto an intermediate conveyor and from there to a reversible generally vertically disposed feeder conveyor.Sensors are included in the sorting machine at pre sternined locations as part of the control system and tor jam detection. The jam detection system is designed to provide a visual readout code on the control panel for indicating the nature of and likely location of a paper jam. Brief Description of Drawings Figure 1 is z perspective outline view showing the general arrangement and organization of the sorter including both feeder. and distributor sections Figure 2 is a detailed view of the control panel for the machine, and Figure 3 is a partial schematic and block diagram showing major subeircuit or component sections of the control system Description of the Preferred Embodiment Referring now to the drawings and particularly toFigures 1 and 3, it will be seen that the sorter mechanism is generally designated by the number 10 and receives paper copies from 2 duplicator or press device generally desiGnated by the number 12.A feeder section of the sorter is identified by the number 14 and a paper receiver mechanism is identified by the num.er 16 which moves laterally back and forth on a track structure 18. The feeder 14 includes a proof tray assembly 20 and 7 control panel box 22 as well as infeed conveyor 24 which feeds papers either to a downwardly inclined intermediate conveyor 26 or an upwardly inclined intermediate conveyor 28.section generally designated by the number 30 supports a vertically disposed reversible feeder conveyor 32 together with tray deflectors and guides 3 and its 36 in the receiver section 16. As can be seen, the tower Section 30 Is supported on a base section ZS. As can be seen by reference to Figure 3, three sets of photoelectrIc sensors are provided, one bei. the light emitting diode and photo receiver sensor 40 at the entrance to the proof tray conveyor. A secs light emittillg diode and photo receiver 42 are previous to the junction of the up down intermediate conveyors 26 and 28 with the inner end of Infeed c nveyor 24. light emitting diode 4s and photo receiver 44 are disposed generally parailel to the face of vertical u down conveyor 2 and the deflector and guIdes 34. The control panel as seen in Figure 3 is provided with a vertical row of nunber or digit buttorjs 50 and a vertical row of selector buttons 52 corresponding to indicator lights 54 aiid the parameter indicia 56 also seen in vertically arranged rows on the face of the control console. Four sets of digital or nurteric three place readout displays 58 are provided to correspond with the first four control parameter inaices seen in respect of number 56. To the left of the control panel can be seen thumb switch 64 for a count adjust which anticipates the number of sheets which are in transit from the press or duplicator to the feeder after the press has been shut off. Thumb switch 62 allows the operator to select the nusser of copies for each master which will be directed into the proof tray 20. Finally the third tiiumb switch 64 allows the operator to tell the control system the number of bins, that is modules of 190 trays, bein used. A toggle switch 66 tells the control system which size trays are being used in the bin modules. For the purpose of providing a better understanding of the jam detection system a brief description of the operation wii l now be set forth. The sorter has the ability to store the parameters set forth as indicia by number 56 These parameters will define specifics for sorting from one to nine different jobs in sequence. Entry of the job parameters is accomplished by a series of depressions of 000 various function and digit keys 52 and 59 on the panel.The operator receives direction and readout in for mation from the different niimeric parameter displays and condition indicators on the panel. 5he first parameter associated with each sorting job is the job parameter which defines the job s positiDn in the sequence of Up to nine jobs which may be entered rnd stored in the machine s control memory.Jobs are executed in the same order in which the are entered. The next parameter is the first tray parameter.This defines the position number or address of the tray which will receive the first sheet during sorting of a given job. Tray addresses may range from 0 to 600, with 0 denoting proof tray 20 shown in Figure 1. The third parameter is sets and this defines the number of sets which will result from the sorting job. Sets values range from 1 to 600. The fourth parameter is pages and this defines the number of pages masters in each set to be sorted during the job. Pages values range from 1 to the total number of sheets which can be fit into a um of two trays. as order to enter uarameters defining the jobs to be sTted, the operator lust be sure that the system is in enter mode, signified by the fact that the enter ind ator light 54 is lit. Once in the enter mode, the parawmeters for the various jobs must be entered in older of increasing job nurber. The four parameters for a given job must be secuentially entered in the order seen as the first four indicia, that is job 1 first tray , sets, and pages . A job will not be accepted for sorting unless the operator has successfully entered each of the four parameters for that job.After nine complete sets of job parameters have been entered, the system will automatically go to the sort mode. Next it will turn the enter indicator 54 off and the sort Indicator 54 on, and wait for a sort execution command from the operator. If the operator wishes to run fewer than nine jobs, he will press sort following successçul entry of the last par .eter of the last job to be sorted, whereupon the system goes to sort4 Rode, The numeric values for first tray , sets and pages parameters can be entered one digit at a tisTe when their respective indicators are lit.When the display 5 holds the value desired for that parameter, the orator presses enter to record the parameter for the cur ent job being specified. Depressing the sort key causes the receiver conveyor to move into position for feeding paper into the first tray address. Jam Detection Action In the sort mode the system is continuously monitoring all events at the various sensors to see if sheets are making their way through the sorter without problem. Checks performed at the proof, up down. and tower sensors include counting each sheet that passes and measuring the amount of time each sheet is seen by each of the sensors. Whenever an irr egularity in the flow of sheets i.e. jam is detected, the systm suspends current sorting operation and takes the following action 1. Cause press feed Interrupt to stop the flow of sheets iPtO the sorter. 2. De entergize proof deflectors to send any residual sheets due to press run out to the proof tray. 3. DeactIvate both sorter clutches. 4. Turn off sorter conveyor belts. 5. Turn off receiver conveyor motor, terminatin any move in progress. 6. Turn on the paper path indicator lamp 54. 7. Display a number between 901 and 909 in the first tray display O8 which tells the operator by predetermined code the cause of the jam. Also, the sets numeric display 58 the operator is told the number of sets remaining which are to be completed at the time the jar. occurred. At this point, the operator must take corrective action, the nature of which depends upon the jam condition being displayed in the first tray numeric display. It is then the operator s responsibility to remove all sheets fro the conveyor and from the line of view of any of the sensors. While in the jam mode, various panel keys may i. pressed, resulting in the following actions a any key pressing any key will cause the audio alarm to be turned off. b stop off turn fans off. c enter returns the system to the job parameter entry raode causing any jobs previously held in memory to be not executed. d paper path first depression of this button 52 causes the receiver conveyor to move back to its home or zero switch to allow eyainination of the tower area. The second depression of this button causes the receiver conveyor to return to the position it was in when the jam occurred. e continue sorting may be resumed if all the sensors are found to be free of paper and when operator has removed all paper from sorter conveyor path.It must be noted that the receiver must be at its pre jam position in order to resume sorting. Upon successful jam recovery, the system resumes sorting by taking the following action 1 Turn off the continue and paper path indicator lamps 54. 2 Re display proper first tray for the job hexing sorted and redisplay the proper number of sets for that job. 3 Turn on the conveyor belts and fans. 4 After a one second delay, the controls activate the press feed. 5 The system is returned to its pre jam mode, either proof or sort. Jam Identification Table The control panel will display automatically one of the following nine jam conditions at the time a face OCCURS to indicate the location and nature of theIRREGULARITY. The jam code number is displayed in the ist Tray numeric display 58.JAM MO.
