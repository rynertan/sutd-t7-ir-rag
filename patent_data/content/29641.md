# Printing apparatus.

## Abstract
In a printer of the type in which print is formed on a drum by an electrostatic process in which charges in the shape of the characters to be printed are placed on the surface of the drum and after development the print is transferred therefrom onto a print receiving surface of a print medium by means solely of pressure acting between the print medium and the drum and in which the drum comprises an electric ally conductive former having a cylindrical surface uniformly coated with a dielectric layer, a drum charging system which comprises an array of parallel conductors and an elastomeric laminate 5 in the form of a strip having one end contacting each conductor of said array 2 of parallel conductors and the other end wiping the dielectric surface of the drum 3 along a line parallel to the drum axis, said laminate being formed by a plurality of contiguous layers which are alternately conduc tive and non conductive, each of which layers is oriented to respectively extend from the array of conductors to the said drum in a plane normal to the axis of the latter. Each conduc tor is connected to a respective pulse driver and the pulse drivers are connected to a character generating means. In the preferred arrangement the array of parallel conductors com prises an array of conductors on a printed circuit board. The system is shown embodied in a hand manipulatable printer and also in a high speed line printer.
