# Improved mechanical seal assembly.

## Abstract
A mechanical seal assembly having a rotatable sealing ring means 18 mounted for rotation on a shaft and a stationary sealing ring means 20 connected to a housing flange, the sealing ring means having opposed sealing surfaces 22, 24 . The assembly also has means 42 urging the sealing surfaces toward one another. The rotatable sealing ring means 18 is of stepped configuration and constructed as an integral pair of equal axial length ring portions A, B , one portion having its inner and outer diameters larger than the respective diameters of the other. Generally, the ring portion having the smallest inner and outer diameter is that ring portion having the sealing surface one that opposes the sealing surface of the stationary sealing ring means. The degree of deflection of the sealing surface because of hydraulic load or pressure can be selected by selecting the diameters of the pair of ring portions, i.e., if the ring portions have substantially the same shrinkage, the sealing surface will remain substantially flat if the shrinkage of the ring portion with the largest inner and outer diameters is more than the other ring portion, the seal surface will become convex if the opposite relationship of the cross sections is selected, the seal surface will become concave.
