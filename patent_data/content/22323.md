# Solid state imaging device.

## Abstract
A solid state imaging device with a sensor part 81 utilising discontinuous scanning pulses having fixed interval times, and having a signal processing circuit to eliminate fixed pattern noise. In the signal processing circuit, a switching element 85 is disposed in a feedback circuit 84 of a signal amplifier for example, preamplifier 83 , and a switching element 86 is disposed at an output end of the signal amplifier. The switching elements 85, 86 are turned on by pulses R during the intervals between the discontinuous scanning pulses. This suppresses fixed pattern noise while attaining a high signal to noise ratio.
