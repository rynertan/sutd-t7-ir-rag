# Ceramic coated rolls.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a ceramic coated roll for transporting strip material eg. stainless steel strip. In particu lar, the surface of the roll 1 is initially finely ground and then spray coated with at least one layer of a ceramic material 5 the surface is then finished by linishing. Rolls in accordance with this invention have been used on softening and descaling stages in a stainless steel strip processing line and the integrity and the average life time of these rolls has been found to be much better than their asbestos coated counter parts, showing a marked cost saving.

## Description
CERAMIC COATED ROLLS This inventor, reiates to transport rolls, and more particularly relates to rolls for transporting high grade steel strip. Ir the transportation of such strip, especially whilst e.g. in excess Or 10000C. hot as during processing through annealing stages, great care has to be taken that the strip is not marked by its passage over these rolls. The surface finish of such rolls is thus of great importance and since conventional high grade steel rolls cannot be used, at least with steel as the strip engaging surface because of mutual scaling problems on the strip roll, asbestos surfaced rolls have hitherto been used in these applications. The useful life of these rolls however, is short lived since they wear and quickly develop a negative or hollow camber deforming the. hot strip and causing strip tracking difficulties. Such rolls can also break up giving rise to ridges along the length of the strip. It is an object of this invention to mitigate these problems. From one aspect, the present invention provides a strip transport roll, the surface of which has been finely ground and then spray coated with at least one layer of a ceramic material and surface finished by linishing. Preferably, the roll comprises a tubular steel body with provision for water cooling from within. The tubular steel surface may be turned and or shot peened prior to grinding and the ceramic deposit may comprise a first layer having good adhesion qualities with the steel body and a surface layer having good wear resistant qualities. A yet further latter may be sandwiched between the two ceramic layers to distribute the thermal stresses occurring during operation. Rolls in accordance with this invention have been used experimentally on softening and descalina stages in a stainless steel strip processing line, more particularly between and adjacent annealing furnaces and between the latter and at least the first of the subsequent cooling stations,but they could of course be used elsewhere in these stages. The integrity and the average lifetime of these ceramic coated rolls has been found to be much better that1 their asbestos counterpart showing a marked cost saving. In addition of course, the health concern and care necessary with the use of asbestos is of no consequence. In order that the invention may be fully understood, one embodiment thereof will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing, which sceatically illustrates a side elevation of a water cooled ceramic coated strip carry over roll. Referring ndw to the drawing, the roll comprises a mild steel tube 1 having end plates 2 with bearing stubs 3 welded on, the bearing stub at each end having a centrally disposed bore 4 therethrough for the entry and exit of water for conventional cooling purposes. The thickness of the steel tube is selected to give a compromise between a tendency to bend under thermal or physical load and minimum weight to keep the inertia as low as possible. The roll surface is initially turned and then ground with e.g. a 320 grit finish. Subsequent to this the ceramic coating 5 is applied. In particular, this is effected by initially depositing c 0.005 metal layer of nickel aluminice by thermal spraying, subsequently laying down 0.010 of a compound powder cermet 70E aluminium oxide 30 nickel aluminide, and then finally spraying on to the latter magnesium zirconate to a thickness of 0.0101 . After cooling naturally to room temperature the ceramic surface is then finished by linishing with fine silicon paper. Worn rolls may be re furbished in much the s manner, the old coating being removed by shotblasting, air chiselling etc. the surface being re ground preparatory to She laying down of the fresh coating. Rolls coated in this fashion exhibit very superior qualities in use and the principal reason for this is believed to be the fact that the coating is applied to a finely ground surface. The application of this coating to a conventional turned surface has been found to be unsatisfactory because the turning rings inevitably formed on the surface create local high pressure lines beneath the coating, and this tends to promote the build up of scale from the hot strip into nodules on the ceramic surface at points in alignment with these high pressure lines these indent and blemish the strip as it passes over the roll.The precise reason for this buildup at the high pressure points is not fully understood but micro analysis has revealed the presence of silicon at grain boundaries in the magnesium zirconate which indicates that silicon or a silicate may be acting as an adhesive medium for the scale particles, at the operatina temperatures. In this regard adequate roll cooling is important because as the tenlperature increases so also does the tendency for greater particle ilesion by silicates. In accordance with this invention the absence of preferential loading on high spots avoids or substantially mitigates this scale particle build up. Clearly it is not essential to utilise flame spraying for depositing the coating, plasma spraying could alternatively be used and various other ceramics or cermets may be deposited and the thicknesses of the coating layers may be dlzferent from those exemplified above.
