# Dartboards.

## Abstract
A dartboard consists of a disc 10 divided into target zones by exposed edges of thin strips of metal 12 disposed or embedded in slots 11 , the exposed edges preferably lying substantially flush with the surface 13 of the disc.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A target comprising at least one layer of material for receiving and releasably retaining a missile, such as a dart, the missile receiving surface being divided into a plurality of target zones, and the border of at least one target zone being formed by an exposed edge of a thin strip of substantially impenetrable material disposed or embedded in the layer or layers. 2. A target according to Claim 1 in which the exposed edge lies substantially flush with the missilereceiving surface of the target. 3. A target according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 in which the exposed edge is chamfered, sharpened or radiused. 4. A target according to any one of the preceding claims in which the strip is a metal strip. 5. A target according to any one of the preceding claims in which the strip extends only part way through the thickness of the layer or layers. 6. A target according to any one of the Claims 1 to 4 in which the strip extents completely through the layer or layers such that the layer or layers are divided by the strip into discrete segments. 7. A target according to Claim 1 in which the borders of each zone are formed by exposed edges of such a strip, and wherein the strips are combined to form a one piece frame. 8. A target according to Claim 7 in which the frame is slotted into the said layer or layers of target material. 9. A target according to Claim 7 in which the target zones are formed as discrete segments which fit into the frame. 10, A target according to Claim 9 further comprising neans for holding the assembled segments together.

## Description
This invention relates to a target, such as a dartboard. A conventional dartboard has a surface mounted wire frame which sub divides the board into discrete target zones. This frame, and the staples fixing the frame to the board are often the cause of darts bouncing off the board, particularly near the centre where the wires are close together.On the other hand, if the target zones are merely indicated visually, for example by painting the zones different colours, disputes can arise over which zone a dart or other missile has entered. According to the present invention the border of at least one target zone in a target is formed by an exposed edge of a thin strip of impenetrable material embedded in the target. The exposed edge preferably lies substantially flush with the surface of the target, and is preferably chamfered, sharpened or radiused.The impenetrable strip material is preferably metal. The target is preferably formed of a material capable of receiving and releasably retaining a missile, such as a dart aimed at the target. The embedded strip may extend either partly through the thickness of the target, or it may extend completely through the target so that the target is divided into discrete segments. Preferably the borders of each target zone are formed by the exposed edges of such strips, and the strips combined to form a one piece frame. The frame is then either slotted into a target board, or the target is formed as an assembly of discrete segments which fit into the frame. In the latter case, further means are provided to hold the assembled segments together. The latter arrangement has the advantage that the discrete segments can be rotated or interchanged to allow for localised wear. Two examples of the invention are illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which FIG. 1. is a part section through a dartboard embodying the invention, FIG. 2. is a part section through an alternative dartboard embodying the invention, and FIG. 3. is a section through three possible metal strips for use in the embodiments of Figs. 1.and 2. In FIG.1. a dartboard 10 consists of a thick circular disc formed of any material which will receive and releasably retain the point of a dart. Suitable materials would be a plastics foam, felt, cork, or a composite. The disc is provided with slots 11 which divide the board 10 into the conventional target zones of a dartboard. Metal strips 12 are inserted into the slots 11, the strips 12 being joined to one another to form a one piece frame. The strips fit tightly in the slots and are therefore held in the slots by the resiliency of the material forming the board 10. The top edge of each strip lies substantially flush with the surface 13 of the board 10. In FIG. 2 like parts are denoted with like reference numerals. The onlydifference between Figs.l and 2 is that in Fig. 2 the strips 12 extend through the whole thickness of the board 10 from the front surface 13 to the back surface 14. The board is thus split into discrete segments, and these segments are held together within a tray 15 or in any other suitable manner. In either embodiment, the top edges of the strips 12 may be rounded, as shown in Fig. 3a, provided with a double chamfer as shown in Fig. 3b, or square as shown in Fig. 3c. The strips have a thickness of approximately 0.5.mm.
