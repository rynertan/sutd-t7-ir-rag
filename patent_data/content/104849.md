# Condensation prevention apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for preventing the formation of condensation within a cabinet. A light reflective surface is mounted within the cabinet and thermally linked to the exterior of the cabinet so that the reflective surface temperature responds more rapidly to changes in the external ambient temperature than the cabinet itself. The formation of condensation on the reflective surface is detected by monitoring a light beam reflected from the reflective surface. When the formation of condensation on the reflective surface is detected a heater inside the cabinet is turned on to cause the condensation to evaporate.
