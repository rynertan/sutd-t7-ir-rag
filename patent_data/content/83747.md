# Dual clutch multiple countershaft transmission.

## Abstract
First and second concentric input shafts are connected to an engine crankshaft through friction clutches, one for each input shaft. Two countershafts carrying forward speed ratio and reverse drive output gears are driven from pinions carried by each of the input shafts. Synchronizer clutches connect the output gears to the respective countershafts. The first forward speed output gear is mounted on its counter shaft by way of an overrunning clutch. One forward speed output gear is continuously engaged with the reverse drive output gear and functions as a reverse idler for changing the direction of rotation of the countershah when reverse drive is selected.
