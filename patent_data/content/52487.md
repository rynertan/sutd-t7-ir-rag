# Method for manufacture of silicon carbide.

## Abstract
Silicon carbide of improved quality is obtained by using a liquid silicic acid or modified liquid siiicic acid as a silicic substance and carbon in a powdered form, a precursor of carbon in a powdered form, or a precursor of carbon in the form of a solution as a carbonaceous substance, and thermally treating these raw materials in a non oxidative atmosphere. The silicon carbide thus produced is finely divided and in high purity and suitable for use as raw material for the production of high strength sintered articles.
