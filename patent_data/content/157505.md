# High frequency semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device includes a metallic container 30 for containing a radio frequency semiconductor circuit 3 on a bottom surface 1 thereof a cap 19 for covering the con tainer and input and output terminals 13a, 13b connected to the circuit 3 and penetrating through a side wall 2a of the container at locations opposite to each other. The bottom sur face 1 of the container includes space for mounting the radio frequency semiconductor circuit 3 and supplementary space for mounting elements 17 of a supplementary circuit. A cut off member 15 for increasing the cutoff frequency of the waveguide mode wave propagation between the input and output terminals within the container is provided on a part of the supplementary space, so that the cutoff frequency is higher than the wave frequency used in the radio frequency semicon ductor circuit.
