# Light beam scanning apparatus.

## Abstract
A light beam scanning apparatus comprises an ultrasonic light deflector for diffracting a light beam of a pre determined wavelength, and a reflecting mirror positioned approximately normal to light deflected by the ultrasonic light deflector for reflecting the deflected light and making it again impinge upon the ultrasonic light deflector.
