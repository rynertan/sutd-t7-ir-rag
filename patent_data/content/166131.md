# Electric motor mounting apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention is a mounting arrangement for mounting a flange mounted electric motor M of the type including a motor housing 15 and a mounting flange 17 fixed to the housing and formed with a first bearing surface 18 , at least two flange mounting ears 19 , and mounting openings 20 formed in the flange mounting ears. In accordance with the invention the mounting arrangement comprises a support ing frame 17 for supporting the electric motor M , a second bearing surface 23 on the supporting frame 12 adapted to mate with the first bearing surface 18 on the mounting flange 17 , and at least two motor support mem bers 24 on the supporting frame 12 adapted to cooperate with the flange mounting ears 19 . The invention is characterised in that the bearing sur faces 18, 23 are both cylindrical and in that each motor support member 24 includes an inner portion 25 attached to the supporting frame 12 , a resilient outer portion 26 extending from the inner portion 25 and in spaced apart relationship with the support frame 12 , and a cam projec tion 30 extending from the outer portion 26 towards the supporting frame 12 so that its outer surface 30a is nor mally spaced from the supporting frame 12 by a distance less than the width of each of the flange mounting ears 19 . In order to mount the motor M the mounting flange 17 is placed on the supporting frame 12 so that the cylindrical bearing surfaces 18, 23 mate and the mounting flange 17 is then rotated to that each of the flange mounting ears 19 engages with a respective motor support member 24 with each flange mounting ear 19 being located in the space between the outer portion 26 of its associated motor sup port member 24 and the support frame 12 . Further rota tion of the mounting flange 17 causes each flange mount ing ear 19 to engage with the cam projection 30 of the associated motor support member 24 to cause deflection of the associated outer portion 26 , and still further rotation of the mounting flange 17 causes each cam projection 30 to become positioned in the mounting hole 20 of the asso ciated flange mounting ear 19 so as to secure the motor M in position mounted on the supporting frame 12 .
