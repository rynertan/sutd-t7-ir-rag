# Thermoplastic elastomer composition and process for preparation thereof.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a thermoplastic elastomer composition excellent in the injection fusion bondability and the surface gloss, which comprises 1 an amorphous ethylene α olefin copolymer a and 2 i a lowly crystalline copolymer b of propylene with an α olefin having at least 4 carbon atoms, ii a polymer d composed mainly of 1 butene or iii a combina tion of the copolymer b or the polymer d with a crystalline polymer c composed mainly of propylene, wherein the component 1 is present in an amount of 10 to 95 by weight based on the total amount of the components 1 and 2 , the component 2 is present in an amount of 5 to 90 by weight based on the total amount of the components 1 and 2 , and the component 1 or the components 1 and 2 are partially crosslinked. The partial crosslinking is effected by grafting of a radical polymerizable monomer having at least two polymerizable groups.
