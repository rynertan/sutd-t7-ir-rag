## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING ENTRY OF INFORMATION BY COORDINATE INPUT DEVICE This invention relates to a method and apparatus for controlling the entry of information performed by a coordinate input device such as a tablet, A tablet is an input device having a digitizing function for discriminating positions designated by a pen, and finds use in such devices as enter characters and the like. A tablet makes it possible to enter the positions of points located on a drawing or other graphic even if the drawing does not indicate dimensions in writing. This is accomplished merely by placing the drawing on the tablet surface and designating the desired point with the pen, whereby the position of the point is entered into memory directly from the drawing.It would be very convenient if such a tablet could be used in programming for the preparation of an NC numerical control tape directly from a design drawing, and it is to such concept that the present invention appertains. When using a tablet as a graphic input device, it is conventional practice to use the tablet to enter the points on the drawing and to use a keyboard or the like to enter other information, such as the necessary control information. When a large quantity of control information is to be entered, however, or when it is required to enter information of a special nature, a general purpose keyboard cannot be used. In the prior art, therefore, specialized keyboards must be manufactured for use in certain situations, leading to higher costs. Another disadvantage is that the tablet and keyboard used are provided at different locations, so that the operator must move back and forth between these locations to input information. The conventional arrangement therefore exhibits poor operability and makes it difficult to enter information at a rapid rate. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a method of controlling the entry of information by a coordinate input device, wherein a tablet enters predetermined information via the coordinate input device which produces an output indicative of the coordinates of a position designated on the surface of the tablet by designating means, which method comprises the step of a specifying the position of an information input zone provided on the surface of the tablet by entering the coordinates of said information input zone, and b discriminating whether coordinates produced as an output by the tablet indicative of a position designated by the designating means correspond to the specified position of the information input zone, an input of said information being identified when correspondence is achieved. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided an apparatus for controlling the entry of information by a coordinate input device having coordinate designating means and a tablet, wherein the tablet is operable to enter predetermined information via the coordinate input device which produces an output indicative of the coordinates of a position designated on the surface of the tablet by the designating means, which apparatus comprises arithmetic means for computing positional information indicative of an information input zone provided on the surface of the tablet, from coordinates specifying the information input zone produced as an output by said tablet in an information input setting mode, and discrimination means for identifying designation of the information input zone by the designating means by comparing, in a data input mode, coordinates produced as an output by the tablet and the computed positional information. An embodiment of the present invention may provide a method and apparatus for controlling the entry of information performed by a coordinate input device, through which control information can be entered by utilizing a tablet. An embodiment of the present invention may provide a method and apparatus for controlling the entry of information performed by a coordinate input device, through which it is possible to set an information input zone on a tablet and to change the information input zone. An embodiment of the present invention mary provide a method and apparatus for controlling the entry of information performed by a coordinate input device, through which the entry of both control information and coordinate values is performed by using a tablet, thereby making it possible to lower the cost and simplify the arrangement of the associated equipment.

Reference will now be had to the accompanying drawings to describe a method and apparatus for controlling the entry of information according to the present invention for a case where the invention is applied to a system designed to create NC, or numerical control, data. The detailed construction and operation will become clear in the course of describing the processing required up to the final creation of the NC data. Fig. 1 is a view showing the general features of an NC data preparation system to which a coordinate input method according to the present invention can be applied. The system includes the main body 11 of an apparatus for creating NC data. The main body 11 comprises a keyboard lla having a multiplicity of keys, a graphic display device llb, a magnetic tape unit llc for loading a magnetic tape cassette, a printer Ild, and a control unit, not shown. The latter is constituted by a microcomputer which executes processing for the input and output of information, for digitizing and for the creation of NC data, all executed by means of a tablet described hereinbelow, based on a system program stored previously in memory means such as a ROM read only memory .The mulitplicity of keys provided on the keyboard lla are for responding to prompts which appear on the system CRT, for designating system program loading, and for entering NC data. The graphic display device llb displays, in graphical form, coordinate values obtained by digitization of positions designated by the tablet, as well as input data, numerical values, NC data and various messages or prompts for conversational interaction with the operator. The magnetic tape unit llc is used to enter a system program into the main body of the NC data creating apparatus 11. By way of example, when using a tablet to enter coordinate values directly from a drawing and prepare NC data, the software system program for digitizing processing must be fed into the main body 11.This is done by selecting the magnetic tape cassette containing the digitizing program, and loading the cassette into the magnetic tape unit llc. To read the tape into the system, the operator need only touch a load button on the keyboard lla after the cassette has been set in the tape unit llc. The printer lld is adapted to print out characters which appear on the screen of the graphic display device llb, data punched in a paper tape, described later, and information which has been written into the loaded magnetic tape. The system also includes a paper tape reader puncher 12 for preparing an NC tape by punching a paper tape with perforations indicative of the NC data prepared by main body 11, and for reading NC or other data which has already been punched into an NC tape. The system tablet, designated at 13, comprises a board which uses the principle of electromagnetic.induction to enteL data. By relying upon a field generating device such as a cursor unit or stylus pen as means for designating coordinates, the tablet 13 is operable to input positional coordinates from a drawing laid on the tablet surface, these coordinates being fed into the main body 11 as an input thereto. The perspective view of Fig. 2 shows the external appearance of the tablet 13 in greater detail. The tablet 13 comprises a tablet main body or board 13a, a tablet cover 13b, a cursor unit 13c, a stylus pen 13d, a buzzer 13e, a group of lamps 13f indicating, e.g., coordinate input mode and introduction of power, an input output connector for connecting the tablet 13 to the main body 11, a power unit 13h for supplying the table body 13a with D.C. power, an A.C. cable 13i for connecting the power unit 13h to an A.C. source, a D.C. cable 13j for the connection between the tablet body and power unit, and a pen stand 13m for holding the stylus pen 13 when not in use. The cursor unit 13c or stylus pen 13d is used to enter coordinate and other data. The details of the cursor unit 13c are illustrated in the enlarged view of Fig. 3, in which a top view of the cursor unit is shown. The cursor unit 13c has a main body CSB, first and second switches SW1, SW2, a position reader PR having a cross hair arrangement, a connector CNT and a cable CNT leading from the connector CNT to the main body CSB. To enter the.coordinates of a point, the intersection Pc of the cross hairs provided on the position reader PR are aligned with the desired point on a drawing laid on the tablet body, followed by depressing the first switchSW1 or second switch SW2. A flowchart for describing how an NC tape is prepared is depicted in Fig. 4. The procedure may be broadly classified into operation s of preprocessing, data input, NC data editing and data output. Reference will now be had to Fig. 4 to describe the general features of NC data creation and output. 1 System loading step First, following the introduction of power, the operator sets the magnetic tape cassette containing the prescribed software system program in the magnetic tape unit llc Fig. 1 and touches the load button on the keyboard lla to store the system program in a main memory incorporated within main body 11 of the system. This causes the title e.g. FAPTDIGITIZER of the system program, as well as a prompt calling for pressing of an R key, to appear on the screen of the graphic display device llb, as shown inFig. 5. 2 F Key setting step The keyboard lla includes an array of eightF keys Fo to F7 which remain locked in the on state when depressed. The operator, by setting the desiredF keys in the on depressed or off state, selects, the operating mode of the tablet 13 as well as the output device to be used. Table I, shown below, gives the function and meaning of each F key, as well as the associated subject matter. It should be noted that theF keys can be set prior to the system loading step if desired. 3 Step for setting initial conditions After setting the F keys, the operator sets the conditions for the preparation of an NC tape.Specifically, four Ro to R4 of the abovementionedR keys are provided on the keyboard lla. First, the operator depresses the R3 key, causing the prompt REQUEST to appear at the lower left side of theCRT screen. The operator responds to the prompt by setting and entering conditions in accordance with predetermined rules, and then depresses an NL key, TABLE I EMI13.1 Key SEP Function SEP Subject SEP Meaning tb Symbol tb F0 SEP Input SEP Test SEP Mode SEP To SEP constantly SEP display SEP coordinate SEP values tb SEP sensed SEP by SEP tablet tb F1 SEP SEP Input SEP Data SEP To SEP confirm SEP coordinate SEP values SEP sensed SEP by tb SEP Confirmation SEP tablet, SEP and SEP to SEP change SEP coordinate SEP values tb SEP Mode SEP when SEP requird tb F2 SEP Output SEP Output SEP Mode SEP When SEP F2 SEP is SEP ON, SEP to SEP establish SEP step SEP feed tb SEP during SEP NC SEP data SEP output SEP and SEP enable SEP both tb SEP insertion SEP and SEP deletion SEP of SEP data tb F3 SEP SEP CRT SEP To SEP display SEP list SEP of, SEP e.g., SEP NC SEP data, SEP on tb SEP Characters SEP CRT tb F4 SEP SEP CRT SEP Graphics SEP To SEP display SEP graphically, SEP on SEP CRT, SEP coordinate tb SEP values SEP entered SEP by SEP tablet tb F5 SEP SEP Printer SEP To SEP print SEP out, SEP via SEP printer, SEP list SEP of SEP results tb SEP of SEP FAPT SEP execution tb F6 SEP SEP Paper SEP Tape SEP To SEP punch SEP NC SEP command SEP data SEP into SEP paper SEP tape tb F7 SEP SEP MT SEP Cassette SEP To SEP write SEP NC SEP command SEP data SEP into SEP magnetic tb SEP tape SEP Cassette tb located on the keyboard RTI ID 14.1 Ila, two consecutive times.This restores the CRT screen to the display depicted inFig. 5 and ends the condition setting processing. The conditions which can be set are, e.g., machine tool parameters, input output units English or metric system, etc. and special codes. The machine tool parameters may include the name of each axis of movement X, Y, Z... , the minimum unit set for each axis of movement, and G function instruction codes indicating quick feed, linear cutting feed, clockwise and counter clockwise circular interpolation, absolute command and incremental commands, etc. . 4 Step for setting execution conditions Next, the operator depresses the R1 key to set various conditions for system program execution.The information shown in Fig. 6 will appear on the CRT screen of the graphic display device llb when the R1 key is depressed. Now, in accordance with the conditions which are desired to be set, the operator may select one of the eight items numbered 01 to 08 shown in Fig. 6. When one of the item numbers is keyed in, a prompt appears on the display screen for each of various conditions to be set with regard to the entered item number. When the operator has successively entered the set conditions in response to the prompts, the entry of conditions with regard to the particular item number ends. The operator then depresses the NL key a number of times in succession to return the CRT screen to the display shown in Fig. 6, upon which he may set the conditions for a new item number. Table II shown below gives the meaning of each numbered item. TABLE IIEMI15.1 tb fo.

Entering RAPID opposite this item number will cause the path to be displayed. Item Nos. 2 and 3 are for selecting print and display items, respectively. Prescribed outputs can be printed or displayed by entering the parameters shown in the left column of Table III, included hereinbelow.In order for an output to be capable of print out or display, it is necessary that either key F2 or key F3 of the eight F keys be placed in the ON state. embodiment of the According to a feature of the preseny invention,Item No. 5 is provided for setting a menu position information input zone on the tablet. Since the tablet has the capability of identifying designated points, it can also be made to function as a switch or as information input keys if a portion of the tablet surface is partitioned into a plurality of areas and each area is assigned a specific meaning. For example, if a certain area is set to serve as an absolute command area, designating said area will cause the NC data creating apparatus to create NC data in the form of absolute values from then on.

When a portion of the tablet surface specifically an information input zone described below which is to made to function as a switch or information input key is fixed in area or position, there will be occasions where said information input zone of the tablet surface is covered by the graphic because of the size of the design drawing or the type of design. In such case, the tablet will not be able to discriminate whether a certain area on the tablet surface designated by a pen or the like is a point on the design or an area which is to function as a switch or information input key. While there are also instances where the graphic itself will not overlay the information input zone on the tablet surface, inconveniences can still be encountered because this part of the tablet surface may be covered by a blank portion of the drawing. In view of the foregoing problem, and according to embodiment of the a feature of the present invention, any area on the tablet surface can be set as an information input zone through use of Item No. 5 mentioned above. This will now be described with reference to Fig. 7, which is useful in explaining how an information input zone is set, and with reference to Fig. 8 showing examples of menu configurations for designating the size of the information input zone, the boundaries of areas a through a16 constituting the zone, and the meaning of each area.A menu MN, printed on, e.g., white paper or wax paper, may have a horizontal configuration composed of 16 areas al through a16 in a two row by eight column array, as depicted in Figs. 8A and 8C, or a vertical configuration composed of 16 areas al through a16 in an eight row by two column array, as shown in Fig. 8B.The size of an information input zone depends upon the size of the menu and can be set at will. The menu MN in Fig. 8C, for example, takes up more space than the menu in Fig. 8A. The numbers of rows and columns also can be set as desired. An information input zone is set through the following sequence, described with reference to Fig. 7, in which B is an enlarged view of the portion enclosed by the circle in A Initially, a drawing DR is laid on the tablet surface 13a and affixed thereto by adhesive tape or the like, after which the menu MN is similarly laid on and affixed to the tablet surface 13a, at a portion thereof not covered by the drawing DR, as shown in Fig. 7.When the operator selects Item No. 5 Fig. 6 under these conditions, the following prompt appears on theCRT screen UPPER RIGHT , O thereby inquiring about the position of the upper right portion of the menu MN. The operator responds by positioning the cross hair intersection Pc of the position reader, provided on the cursor unit 13c Fig. 3 , at the upper right corner PrU of the menu MN, shown in Fig. 7B, followed by depressing one of the switchesSW1, Sw2. This causes the X, Y coordinates X1,Y1 of the point P to be fed into the system. Next, the following prompt is displayed LOWER LEFT Q , 0 calling for the entry of the point P1d at the lower left corner of the menu MN. As described above, the operator now places the cross hair intersection Pc of the cursor unit 13c at the point P1d and depresses one of the switches SW1, SW2 to enter the X, Y coordinates X2,Y2 of the point Pld. Distance xw along the X axis and distance Yw along the Y axis are expressed by the following, respectively x X X , Y Y Y ...... 1 Accordingly, the menu will be of the horizontal type if xw yw holds, and of the vertical type if xw holds. Thus the type of menu is decided by the magnitudes of xw, Y2.If a horizontal menu is set in advance to have two rows and eight columns and a vertical menu is set in advance to have eight rows and two columns, by way of example, then, in the case ofFig. 7, xw Yw will hold horizontal menu , and the horizontal and vertical dimensions x , y , respectively, of each area will be X X 8, Y Y Y 8 ... 2 thereby specifying the boundaries of the areas al through a16. This ends the processing for setting an information input zone. Returning to Table II, Item No. 6 is for designating scale and paper reduction ratio for read coordinate values, and Item No. 7 is for entering an NC tape output code, allowing selection and entry of either an EIA code or ISO code. 5 Coordinate Value Input Step When the condition setting processing for execution of the system program is completed by the foregoing operations, the system is ready to accept entry of various data for NC tape preparation. It should be noted that the display of Fig. 5 reappears on the CRT with the conclusion of processing in step 4 i.e., by entering Item No. 8 . The operator now touches key Ro on keyboard lla to initiate processing in accordance with the system program. More specifically, with a touch of key Ro, the CRT displays a prompt calling for either NC data NC tape creation or part program creation, as shown in Fig. 9. The operator enters 01A to execute processing for the creation of NC data, or 02 to execute processing for the creation of a part program.The following discussion will deal with selection of 01 , namely NC data creation. Next, the operator enters various data for NC data creation. Such data may consist of a mode data such as point mode, linear cutting mode and circular arc cutting mode, and b point data relating to points on a drawing. The mode data is entered by designating, through use of the cursor unit, a predetermined area on the information input zone established in step 4 . Fig. 10 illustrates the details of a horizontal type menu MN used in setting an information input zone, in which each area is assigned boundary lines and as well as a particular meaning. Table IV, shown below, indicates the meaning of each of the areas al through a16. Area al is a menu selection zone which must be designated by the operator before a new area can be selected. In other words, the operator, after designating the menu selection area al, may then select any other area, but must re designate area a1 before going to a new area. For example, when the operator wishes to produce an output of NC data in the form of an incremental value, he first designates the menu selection area al. When the NC data creating apparatus acknowledges designation of the menu selection area a1, the following message appears on the CRT screen ENTER ITEM NO.If the operator now places the point Pc of the position reader PR at approximately the center of the area a9 and then depresses switch SW1 or SW2, subsequent coordinate input operations will create NC data in the form of incremental values. Of the various modes mentioned above, the point mode is a mode in which points are entered one at a time to create cutting feed rapid traverse NC data.Selecting the point mode makes it possible to enter points from a drawing by using the tablet. In other words, assume that the operator selects area a13 to establish the point mode, places the cross hair intersection Pc of the cursor unit 13c on prescribed position on the tablet surface and presses the first switch SWl or second switch SW2 Fig. 3 . This will create an item of NC data for rapid traverse or cutting feed movement from the previous position to the just indicated position.When the operator restores switch SW1 or switch SW2 to the original position, moves the cursor unit to another position on the design TABLE IV EMI22.1 Area SEP Meaning SEP Remarks tb a1 SEP Menu SEP Selction SEP Designated SEP when SEP areas SEP a2 SEP to SEP a16 SEP are SEP used SEP as SEP menu tb a2 SEP Blank tb a3 SEP End SEP Selected SEP when SEP FAPT SEP execution SEP is SEP to SEP be SEP ended tb a4 SEP Kyboard SEP Input SEP Selected SEP when SEP NC SEP data SEP are SEP to SEP be SEP entered SEP from tb SEP keyboard tb a5 SEP Sampling SEP Pitch SEP Selected SEP when SEP changing SEP pitch SEP at SEP which SEP points SEP are tb SEP sampled SEP from SEP tablet tb a6 SEP Blank tb a7 SEP NC SEP Data SEP Coordinate SEP Selected SEP when SEP setting SEP origin SEP and SEP axis SEP of SEP NC SEP data tb SEP Designation SEP coordinate SEP system tb a8 SEP Drawing SEP Movement SEP Selected SEP before SEP moving SEP drawing tb a9 SEP Incremental SEP Selected SEP when SEP output SEP of SEP incremental SEP NC SEP data SEP is tb SEP to SEP be SEP produced tb a10 SEP Absolute SEP Selected SEP when SEP output SEP of SEP absolute SEP NC SEP data SEP is SEP to tb SEP b SEP produced tb a11 SEP Starting SEP Point SEP Selected SEP when SEP entering SEP position SEP of SEP tool SEP starting tb SEP Designation SEP point tb a12 SEP Rapid traverse SEP Mode SEP Selected SEP when SEP subsequently SEP arriving SEP read SEP coordin SEP ate SEP values SEP are SEP output SEP in SEP rapid traverse SEP mode tb a13 SEP Point SEP Mode SEP Selected SEP when SEP subsequently SEP arriving SEP read tb SEP coordinate SEP values SEP are SEP output SEP in SEP linear SEP cutting tb SEP or SEP rapid traverse SEP mode tb a14 SEP Cutting SEP Mode SEP Selected SEP when SEP subsequently SEP arriving SEP read tb SEP coordinate SEP values SEP are SEP output SEP in SEP linear SEP cutting tb SEP or SEP circular arc SEP cutting SEP mode tb a15 SEP Continuous SEP Mode SEP Selected SEP when SEP subsequently SEP arriving SEP read tb SEP coordinate SEP values SEP are SEP output SEP continuously SEP in tb SEP rapid traverse SEP or SEP linear SEP cutting SEP mode tb a16 SEP Circular SEP Arc SEP Mode SEP Selcted SEP when SEP circular SEP arc SEP is SEP to SEP be SEP produced SEP from tb SEP two SEP previous SEP points SEP and SEP present SEP point SEP and SEP then tb SEP gutput SEP in SEP circular arc SEP cutting SEP mode tb drawing and then again presses switch SW1 or switchSW2, this creates an item of rapid traverse or cutting feed NC data for movement up to said position.By repeating this operation, the operator may enter successively an item of cutting feed rapid traverse data with respect to each separately entered position i.e., the coordinate values of the position . Note that when area al2 is selected, an item of rapid traverse NC data is created regardless of which of the first and second switches SW1, SW2 is pressed.When area a13 is selected, however, an item of cutting feed NC data is created when switch SW1 is pressed, and an item of rapid traverse NC data when switch SW2 is pressed. Fig. 11 shows an example of a graphic which is entered in the point mode by selecting area a13 and designating a series of points on a drawing one after another using the cursor unit while selectively pressing switch SW1 or SW2 at each point. In Fig. 11, the dotted lines indicate the creation of NC data for rapid traverse, while the solid lines indicate the creation of NC data for linear cutting. Each numerical value 1 indicates when the first switch SW1 was pressed, and each numerical value 2 shows when the second switch SW2 was pressed. As opposed to the point mode, the cutting mode is one in which an item of linear cutting data or circular arc cutting data is created on the basis of each successively entered point coordinate values .Selecting the cutting mode of operation makes it possible to enter points from a drawing by using the tablet 13a. The following will serve as examples a To create NC data for linear cutting The operator selects area al4, aligns the cross hair intersection Pc of the cursor unit 13c with a prescribed position on the tablet 13a and presses switch SW1. This causes the creation of an item of linear cutting data for movement from the immediately preceding position designated by the cursor unit 13c to the newly designated position. It the operator then moves the cursor unit 13c to another position on the tablet surface and presses switch SW1, then this will again produce an output of linear cutting data for movement to said position. Repeating this operation will create NC data for cutting a workpiece by causing a tool to move along a contour of the kind shown inFig. 12. b To create NC data cutting circular arcs The operator selects area a16, aligns the cross hair intersection Pc of the cursor unit 13c with a prescribed position P1 Fig. 13 on the tablet 13a, presses switch SW2, moves the cursor unit 13c to another position p2 on the tablet and again presses switch S2. The entry of the abovementioned two points forms a circular arc CIR from an immediately preceding point Pb and the two newly entered points Pl, P2, thereby creating NC data for circular interpolation.By repeating the above operation, the operator creates successive items of NC data for interpolating circular arcs connected as shown in Fig. 14. The selected arcs each pass through three points. Whether an arc is a clockwise or counter clockwise arc is determined automatically by the points entered. If area a16 is selected, then circular arc cutting data will be created regardless of whether switch S1 or S2 is pressed. c To create NC data for mixed linear and arc cutting by combining operations a and b Fig. 15 illustrates a graphic based on NC data for mixed linear and arc cutting, created by selecting area a14 and combining operations a and b . In Fig. 15, each numeral 1 indicates when the switch SW1 was pressed after aligning the cross hair intersection Pc of the cursor unit with the corresponding point. Likewise, each numeral 2 indicates when the switch SW2 was pressed after aligning the cross hair intersection Pc of the cursor unit with the corresponding point. 6 Recording step The foregoing steps create NC data and store the data in a data memory located internally of the main body 11 of the apparatus for NC data creation.The next step is to preserve the items of created data by reading them out of the data memory and either punching them into a paper tape by way of the tape puncher recording them on magnetic tape. Reference will now be had to Fig. 16 to describe a block diagram of circuitry for practicing the setting of an information input zone according to the present invention. When Item No. 5 is entered from the keyboard in the above described step 4 , namely in the state established by pressing the R1 key, this sends a signalT5, shown in Fig. 16, to logical 1 to establish an information input zone set enable state and to cause the inquiry UPPER RIGHT , g N to appear on the CRT screen, prompting the operator to enter the position at the upper right corner of an information input zone.It will be recalled that the menu MN is affixed to the tablet surface at any location thereon not covered by a drawing. The operator responds to the above message by taking the cursor unit 13c Fig. 3 connected to the tablet 101, placing the cross hair intersection Pc at the upper right corner Pru Fig. 7B of the information input zone and then pressing either the first switch SW1 or second switch SW2 Fig. 3 . This generates a switching signal SS which causes the X, Y coordinates X1,Y1 of the point PrU to be stored in a first register 103 through a multiplexer 102.Next, when the prompt LOWER LEFT 5 , If appears on the CRT screen calling for entry of the position at the lower left corner of the information input zone, the operator aligns the cross hair intersection Pc with the lower left corner P1d and presses either switch SW1 or switchSW2, just as described above, thereby storing the X, Y coordinates X2,Y2 in a second register 104 through the multiplexer 102. It will be assumed that a third register 105 stores the numbers of rows and columns of a horizontal menu, and that a fourth register 106 stores the numbers of rows and columns of a vertical menu. When the operator enters the coordinates of the point at the upper right corner and of the point at the lower left corner, a first processor 107 performs the arithmetic operations xw X1 X2, t Yl Y1 Y2 stores the results xw, Yw in respective fifth and sixth registers 108, 109, discriminates the magnitudes of xw and Yw and sends the result of the discrimination operation to a gate 110. When xw yw holds, the numbers of rows and columns m,n of the horizontal menu are fed into a second processor 111 via the gate 110. When xw Yw holds, the numbers of rows and columns n,m of the vertical menu are similarly applied to the second processor 111 through the gate 110.Using the information input zone horizontal dimension xw and vertical dimension Yw stored in the fifth and sixth registers 108, 109, as well as the numbers of rows and columns m,n , the second processor 111 performs the arithmetic operations xw m, Y Yw m to compute the horizontal dimension x and vertical dimension y of each area in the information input zone, as well as boundary line information for each area. The results are stored in a memory 112. This ends the processing for setting an information input zone. The arrangement of Fig. 16 operates in the following manner when information is entered by designating a predetermined area in the information input zone. In step 5 key Ro depressed , coordinates produced as an output by the tablet are applied to a discriminator 113 via the multiplexer 102.The discriminator 113 compares these coordinates with the boundary line information of the menu selection area at stored in memory 112 and, when the coordinates have values which fall within the boundaries of area al, recognizes that the designated point is within area al, namely that the menu selection area al has been designated. Next, when the operator designates a point any other area of the information input zone by means of the cursor unit, the discriminator 113 compares the coordinates of the designated point with the boundary information stored in memory 112 and determines the area to which the point belongs. The discriminator 113 then produces an output of information conforming to the designated area, in accordance with the result of the discrimination operation.If the coordinates arriving from the tablet do not fall within any of the boundaries stored in the memory 112, however, then these coordinates are treated as graph ic coordinates on a drawing and are delivered intact. embodiment of the In accordance with the present invention as described and illustrated hereinabove, not only coordinates but any form of information can be entered from a tablet. This reduces system costs and makes it much easier to enter information. It has been described that an area for generating the information corresponding thereto cannot be chosen until after the menu selection area al is designated.It should be noted, however, that the invention is not limited to such an arrangement, for the menu selection area may be deleted and an arragement adopted wherein each area can be designated directly to enter the corresponding information. As many apparently widely different embodiments of the present invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the appended claims. Disclosed are a method and apparatus for controlling the entry of information by a coordinate input device having designating means and a tablet 13a, wherein the tablet 13a is capable of entering information other than coordinates by designating an information input zoneXprovided on the coordinate input device, the latter being of the type which produces an output indicative of the coordinates of a position designated on the surface of the tab1etby the designating means. The method includes steps of specifying the position of an information input zone MN on the surface of the tablet 13a by entering the coordinates of the information input zone MN, and discriminating whether coordinates produced as an output by the tablet 13a indicative of a position designated by the designating means correspond to the specifid position of the information input zone MN.
