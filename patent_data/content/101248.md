# FLEXIBLE RECOVERABLE TUBULAR ARTICLE

## Abstract
A convoluted recoverable tubular article 3 is used to enclose a substrate 2. The ends 5 of the article 3 are recovered into engagement with the substrate 2, allowing re entry by severing the article at one end 6 and compressing the article to expose the substrate. The article then can be extended to the extent necessary to reseal it.
