## Description
IMBOVED AUTOItlhTIC SEAMING METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GORED PARrY HOSES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to improved method and apparatus for automatically seaming a gore piece to the inside thigh section of a panty hose, and more particularly relates to improvement in the system for seaming a gore piece to the inside thigh section of a panty hose in an almost automatic fashion. The conventional system for producing a gored panty hose in general tvó staged seaming operations. In the first stage, two leg sections and a panty section are seamed together by the so called skip seaming whilst leaving an unseamed opening in the inside thigh section of an incomplete panty hose. Next in the second stage, s separate gore piece is fitted to the above described thigh section opening and its fringe is seamed to the unseamed sliced ringe of the thigh section, which defined the opening, in order to form a complete panty hose. Due to the comclicated form of the seaming line for coupling of the gore piece with the sliced fringe on the inside thigh section, the second staged seaming operation is extremely complicated and difficult to practice successfully. For this reason, the seaming of the gore piece has conventionally depended upon manual operation by exert orators. This naturally causes low productivity of the second stage seaming operation, increasedhuman labour and resultant high increase in the production cost of gored panty hoses. In addition, it is very difficult even for a single operator to constantly seam a gore piece to the correct position in the thigh section in a correct manner since the seaming is dependent upon manual operation. This connects to inter products variance in quality of panty hoses so produced. When different panty hoses are produced by different operators, the variance is further amplified since the inter products variance is accompanied with interoperators variance. Thus, in the conventional production of gore panty hoses, one cannot expect uniform quality of the products. In order to avoid this advantage, a number of automatic seaming systems for gored panty hoses have bee proposed.Due to the unavoidable presence of the above described complicated seaming line, however, one cannot expect reliable operations of the apparatuses for practicing such automatic seaming systems. In order to obtain high reliability in operation, one needs to adopt an extre nely complicated design for such an apparatus. Thus, it is the state of the art that none of the conventionally proposes systems has been able to carry out the second stage automatic seaming moderation with appreciably sufficient results.SUMMARY OP THE INVENTION It is the basic object of the oresent invention to enable almost automatic seaming of a ore piece to the thigh section of an incomplete zanty ose at remarkably high production efficiency. It is another object of the resent invention to produce gored pelty hoses with low production cost and extremely small inter products variance in quality. It is the other object of the present invention to provide an automatic apparatus bf a simple construction and capable of carrying out the aobve described second stage seaming operation with high reliability in operation. In accordance with the basic aspect of the present invention, an incomplete panty hose prepared in the first stage seaming operation is suckled into a pneumatic suction tube and held in the pipe by assistance of hooks arranged viithin the pipe. Concurrently vftth this suction, the slice fringe of the thigh section opening is folded over the outer surface of the open end of the suction tube Keeping this disposition, pneumatic suction in the suction tube is intercepted and the suction tube with the incomplete pantyhose is brought to a gore niece transfer station.Heat cutting is applied to the folded sliced cringe in order to obtain one or more cuts in the sliced fringe. A gore piece cut into a prescribed shape by a gore piece feeder assembly is passed to a gorepiecetransfer assembly which in turn its the gore piece to the correct position on the incomplete panty hose held bf the suction tube. Next, the folded sliced edge is put into a horizontal state in order to be superimposed on the fringe of the gored piece. keeping this superimposed disposition, the suction tube with the incomplete panty hose and the gore niece is then brought to a seaming station where a sewing machine is arranged.The second stage seaming is carried out by the sewing machine while the suction tube is rotated. During subsequent travel of the suction tube with a seamed panty hose, the complete panty hose is removed out of the system via the suction tube by resumption of the pneumatic suction.BRIEF DESCRIPTION or THE DRAWINGS.

The process includes dualstaged seaming operations. A pair of cylindrical stocking materials 1 and 2, each closed at the toe end, of same size are superposection in the section forming the panty section 6 and the thigh section is sliced. Next, the first seaming operation is applied to the superposed stocking materials in order to obtain an incoriplete panty hose 7a such as shown in Fig. 1.The front and rear side sliced fringes 3 and 4 are seamed together along seam lines 3a and 4a whilst leaving a sliced fringe 5 in the inside thigh section unseamed. The incomplete panty hose thus includes an unseamed opening 5a in the inside thigh section. This sort of so called skip seaming operation can easily be carried out on a knows line close such as the one disclosed in Japanese Patent 880,791. In the second stage seaming operation, a gore piece 10 is fitted to the above described unseamed opening 5a in the incomplete panty hose 7a, and the sliced fringe 5 in theinside thigh section and the fringe of the gore piece 10 are seamed together along a seaming line 8 in order to form a complete gored panty hose such as shown in Fig. 2. One embodiment of the seaming apparatus in accordance with the present invention is shown in Figs. 3 and 4. An operation table 102 is mounted atop a pedestal casing 101 and both are made uD of semi circular sections and integral square sections. An upwardly extending vertical shaft 103 is rotatably arranged about the center of the semi circular section of the operation table 102 and a carrier disc 104 is horizontally mounted atop the main shaft 103. As shorn in Fig. 3, four sets of aot STnVrarily extending suction assemblies 201 are disposed to tlle carrier disc 104 at equal intervals along its periphery. he number of the suction assemblies 201 is unlimitted to four sets and can be chosen as desired in accordance with requirement in practice.The suction assemblies 201 revolve, together with the carried disc 134, about the axis of the main shaft 103 in the counterclockwise direction in the illustration in order. to travel from the first to fourth operation stations I to IV provided on the operation table 102. In the first station I, an incomplete panty hose 7a having an inside thigh opening 5a see Fig. I is manually attached to one suction assembly 201 in that station. The leg sections are pneumatically sucked into the suction tube 203 while the sliced fringe 5 is folder over the outer surface of the louver end of the suction tube 203. Then the pneumatic suction acting on the suction assembly 201 is intercepted by suitable manual switching. As later described in more detail, hooks arranged in the suction tube 203 hold the sucked incomplete panty hose v lithin the suction tube 203 even after the pneumatic suction is provisionally cancelled. In the second station , a gore piece 10 cut into a prescribed shape is passed to a gore piece transfer assembly 401 by a gore piece feeder assembly 301. Concurrently wit this transfer of the gore,piece 10, adequate number of cuts are formed in the section of the sliced fringe 5 folded over the outer surface of the lower end of the suction tube 203 by a heat cut assembly 501. The transfer assembly 401 fits, by its ovmn rotation the gore piece 10 to the correct position on the incomplete pantyhose 7a held by the suction assembly 201 and the sliced fringe 5 is returned to the horizontal state by, e.g.application of pneumatic blown, in order to be superimposed upon the fringe of the gore piece 10 already placed in position on the second station IL In the third station EI, the suction assembly 201 revolves together with the incomplete panty hose 7a and the gore piece 10 so that a sewing machine 601 seams the sliced fringe 5 of the incomplete panty hose 7a with the fringe of the gore piece 10 in order to obtain a complete panty hose 7. In the fourth station IV, the complete panty hose 7 is removed off the suction assembly 201 to be discharged outside the system by a removing assembly 701. Detailed constructions of the above described various assemblies are as follows. 1 The carrier disc 104. As shown in Figs. 3 and 5, the main shaft 103 is rot at ably carried, via thrust bearings 106 and 107, by a cylindrical stand 105 fixed atop the operation table 102.The main shaft 103 is cylindrical in shape and its lower end is connected to an adequate suction source not shown by a suction pipe 108. The pneumatic suction is controlled by ordinary manual switching operation. A drive motor 109 accompanying a knows reduction gear mechanisam is arranged under the operation table 102 and its output shaft carried a drive pulley llOa which is operationally coupled, via a drive belt 111, to a driven pulley 110b mounted to the main shaft 103. By properly controlling the operation of the drive motor 109, the main shaft 103 and the carrier disc 104 are driven for intermittent rotation, each movement covering 90 degrees center angle. ns a substitute for the above described arrangement for the intermittent rotation, any known drive mechanism such as a geneva index unit is usable for the present invention. Further, a known timer or the like is usable for control of the drive motor 109. 2 xhe suction assembly 201. AS shorn in Figs. 3 and 5, each suction assembly 201 includes a vertical suction tube 203 which is rotatably carried at its top by a boss 104a on the carrier disc 104 by means of thrust bearings 202. The suction tube 203 is open at both longitudinal ends and a skirt shaped bottom flange 205 is zEixedly iiiserted over its bottom end. At a level near the top end, a gear 204 is fixedly inserted over the suction tube 203 for engagement with the later described suction tube driver assembly 50. At least one hook 206 is fixed at its lower end to the inside wall of the suction tube 203, which is made of a flexible material such as a synthetic resin. The hook 206 blocks falling of the incomplete panty hose 7a outside the suction tube 203 when the pneumatic suction is intercepted at the first station I. Preferably, thr ee or more hooks 206 are arranged in the suction tube 203 for reliable holding of the incomplete panty hose 7a within the suction tube 203. A cover disc 120 is arranged on the carrier disc 104 whilst being rotatably inserted over the top end of the main shaft 203 via a thrust bearing 121. The diameter of the cover disc 120 is almost equal to that of the carrier disc 104. As later described in more detail, the cover disc 120 is coupled to the pedestal casing 101 by means of the removing assembly 71 and, consequently, held stationarily despite the rotation of the main shaft 103. As shovni in Fig. 6, circular holes 122 and 123 are formed through the cover disc 120 at positions correspondi lg to the first and fourth stations I and IV. The positions of these holes 122 and 123 are selected so that they correctly meet the top opening of a suction tube 203 vhen the latter is in these stations I and IV. A perforated block disc 12 is arranged in the circular hole 122 in the first station I in an arrangement flush with the bottom face of the cover disc 120. The circular hole 122 is connected to the top omening of the main shaft 103 by means of a curved pipe 126. Thus, pneumatic suction acts on the suction tube 203 via the eylindrical main shaft 103, the curved pipe 126 and the perforated block disc 124. 3 The suction tube driver assembly 50. As shwon in Figs. 3 and 5, a drive motor 53 is fixed, by means of a bracket 51, to the cover disc 120 at a position corresponding to the third station III. A gear 55 fixed to its output shaft is engageable with the gear 204 on the suction tube 203 when the latter is at the third station II. As the drive motor 53 is activated , the suction tube 203 starts to rotate about its ovn axis. 4 The gore piece feeder assembly 301 and the gore piece transfer assembly 401. The detailed constructions of the assemblies are shwon in Figs. 3, 4 and 7. In the second station II, a gore piece 10 cost into a prescribed shape is fed by the feeder assembly 301 to the transfer assembly 401 which in turn fits the gore piece 10 to the correct position on the incomplete panty hose 7a held by the suction assembly 201 so that the sliced fringe 5 and the fringe of the gore piece are superimposed in a horizontal state. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the feeder assembly 301 includes a feed reel 303 of the gore niece band which is conveyed towards the transfer assembly 401 by means of feed rollers 306 and 307 via guide and dancer rollers 304 and 305. A supporting stand 310 is arranged on the square section of the operation table 102 and bears a drive motor 311 which is operationally coupled to the reel 303 and the rollers 304, 306 and 307 by weans of ordinary pulleys and a drive belt. on each intemittent rotation of the drive motor 311, the gore Piece band is delivered from the reel 303 bg alergth corresponding to one gore piece 10.A pair of vertically shiftable cutters 312 and 313 are arranged at a position between the rollers 306 and 307 in order to cut out the side fringes of the gore piece band in a triangular shape during the dcell of the intermittent delivery of the band. Concurrently with this procedure, a cutter 314 arranged on the staid 310 in front of the feed roller 307 shifts downwards and form a straight cut in the center of the band in order to form of gore piece 10 of a prescribed shape, e.g. a diamond shape. The construction of the gorse piece transfer assembly 401 will hereinafter be explained in more detail in reference to wigs. 4, 7 and 9O. A cylindrical bracket 403 is fixed to a prescribed position on the operation table 102 and rotatably caries a drum assembly 404. The drum assembly 404 includes a cylindricÅal support shaft 405 having a loser section rotatably inserted into the bracket 403, and a rair of hollow support arms 406 extending horizontally and in opposite directions from the support shaft 405 at a level above the operation table 102. Each support arm 406 carries at its outer end a cylindrical upright shaft 407 having a top flange. A horizontal semi circular plate 408 is located on the top flange of each upright shaft 407. The pair on semi circular plates 408 faces each other along their stright edges whilst leaving a slight gap. Each semi circular slate 408 is provided with numerous suction holes 408a formed therethrough. An inner cylinder 411 Of a double drum 410 is inserted over each upright shaft 407 and a compression spring 414 is imposed between the bottom wall of its outer cylinder 412 and the lower ce of the associated semi circular plate 408 whilst axially surrounding, the upright shaft 407. That is, the double drum 410 is elastically pressed towards the associated support arm 406. A flange 413 is formed atop the outer cylinder 412 and fixedly carries the assiciated seme circular plate 408. In the second station, a pneumatic cylinder 415 is fixed to the lower face of the operation table 102 and its piston rod 415a extends upwards slideably through the operation table 102 in order to face the lower face of the double drum 410. Consequently, as tne piston rod 415a is driven for upward movement by the pneumatic cylinder 415, the double drum 410 is forced to move upwards over a prescribed distance whilst overcoming repulsion of the compression spi ng 414. The lifted position of the double drum 410 is shown rnth chain lines in Fig. 7. Relationship in position between the pair of double drums 410 in the second station II is shown in Fig. 7. That is, the right side double drum 413 faces the downstream terminal of the gore piece feeder assembly 301 in order to receive a gore niece one its semi cirQular rlate from the feeder assembly. The left side double drum in the second station IL is located in axial alignment with the suction tube 203 of the suction assembly 2O1 in that station.In this state, a slight gap is left between the semi circular plate 408 and the lower end of the bottom flange 205 on the suction tube 203. At a level bellow the cylindrical bracket 403, a pulley 402 is fixedly inserted over the support shaft 405 and ope rationally coupled to a pulley 421 on the main shaft 103 see Fig. 3 by means of a drive belt 422. ks the main shaft 103 is driven for rotation by the drive motor 109, the drum assembly 404 with the double drums 410 rotates about the axis of the support shaft 405 in a direction shown by an arrow in ig. 4, i.e. counterclockwise.The ratio in diameter between the two pulleys 420 and 421 is designed 1 2 so that ehe drum assembly 404 completes a 180 degrees rotation upon 90 degrees rotation of the main shaft 103. As the main shaft 133 rotates over 93 degrees, e2ch suction assey 201 tvels from a station to an adjacent station as the pai of double drums 413 atternate in position in order to rest in the new positions. During the awell, a gore piece 10 is passed. to the right side double drum 410 by the feeder assembly 301 whereas the left side double drum 410 assigns a gore piece to the suction assembly 201 in second station II. The lower end of the support shaft 405 is coupled in airtight to a connection pipe 425 which is in turn connected to the suction pipe 8 see Fig. 5 via a valve 426. The valve 426 takes the form of a normally closed valve which is made open only vhen the drum assembly 404 performs the 180 degrees rotation. This opening of the valve 426 allows application of pneumatic suction to the gore piece 10 on the associated semi circular plate 408 via the connection pipe 425, the support arm 405, the support arm 407, a slit 407a in the upright shaft 407, the double drun 410 and the suction holes 408a of the semi circular plate 408, thereby effectively blocking accidental falling of the gore piece during movement of the associated drum assembly 404. As shown in Fig. 3, a flat guide plate 423 extends bet ween the second and third stations II and III along the travelling path of the suction assemblies 201. The top face o tis guide plate 423 is flush with those of the semi circular plate 408 in the lifted position esee Xig. 7 and the sewing table in the third station III. As the suction assembly 201 travels from the second to the third station with the gore piece 10 passed by the feeder assembly 401, the gore piece 10 slides on and along the guide plate 423.Therefore, the top face of the guide plate 423 should preferably as smooth as possible. When necessary, any smoothing finish may be applied to its top face, 5 Heat cut assembly 501. Concurrently yiith transfer of the gore piece at the second station II, cuts are formed in the sliced fringe 5 folded over the suction tube bottom flange 205 by heat cut.In advance to the subsequent seaming on the sewing machine 601, the sliced fringe 5 has to be Teturneato the horizontal state by means of, for example, air blow in order to be superimposed on the fringe of the gore piece 10 located on the sewing table. Presence of the above described cuts enables easy and successful fattening of the sliced fringe 5. It is not aiway necessary to complete this flattening in the third station III. After the heat cut is complete, the pnewnatic flattening may be carried out in the second station II also. It is only required that the sliced fringe 5 should be hori zontaily superimposed upon the fringe of the gore piece in advance to the seaming operation at the third station III. The heat cut assembly 501 will now be explained in more detail whilst referring to Figs. 3, 4, 12 and 13. At a position facing the second station II, a bracket 503 is fixed to the operation table 102 and carries a pneumatic cylinder 505. A rack 507 is fixed at its one longitudinal end to the outer end a piston rod 505a of the cylinder 505.An arm 509 is fixed to the other end of the rack 507 and carries an electric heat cutter 511. The rack 507 is in engagement with a pinion 513 which in turn engages liith a gear 519 on the opposite side of the rack 507. An arm 515 extends from the pinion 513 in a direction substantially normal to the longitudinal direction of the rack 507. Like nse, an arm 521 extends from the gear 519 in alignment rzith the arm 515. The arms 515 and 521 carry electric heat cutters 517 and 523 at their free ends. The arms and the cutters asswne the inoperative position shown with solid lines in Figs. 12 and 13 when the pneumatic cylinder 505 is inoperative. As the cylinder 505 operates, the piston rod 505a projects and the heat cutter 511 with the arm 509 moves towards the suction assembly 201 in the second station II and arrives at the operative position shown with chain lines. Concurrently, arms 515 and 521 sewing towards the suction assembly 201 with their heat cutters 517 and 523 in order to arrive at the operative positions shown with chain lines also. At the operative positions, the heat cutters 511, 517 and 523 touch the sliced fringe 5 on the suction tube bottom flange 205 in order to form cuts at about 120 degrees intervals.As the piston rod 505a receds into the pneumatic cylinder 505 arms and heat cutters all resume the inoperative positions. The number o the heat cutters, i.e. the number of cuts formed in the sliced fringe, is not limited to three. Hov ever, in consideration of simplicity in construction and easiness inflattening operation, it is advantageous to use three sets of heat cutters. 6 A sliced fringe direction adjuster assembly 800. As described already , the transfer assembly 401 receives a gore piece from the feeder assembly in order to transfer it to the suction assembly 201 located at second station II so that the sliced fringe 5 of the incomplete panty hose 7a is superimposed upon the fringe of the gore piece 10. For correct seaming on the sewing machine 601, the seaming line on the gore piece 10 should meet that on the sliced fringe 5 with out any bias.In general on a gore piece 10 made of cotton or the like, its stretch is larger in the warp direction than in the weCt direction. Therefore, it is advantageous that the viarp direction on the gore piece 10 should meet that of the seaming line on the sliced fringe 5. t his adjustment is carried out by the direction adjuster assmbl O0 shown in Figs. 10 and 11. A bracket 801 is mounted to the top end of the cylindrical stand 105 carries a drive motor 802 which is driven for rotation by an electric signal from a later described photoelectric sensor 804. A roller 803 is fixed to the output shaft of the drive motor 802 in pressure contact with he outer wall 205a of the bottom flange 205 on the suction assembly 201 located at the second station II. As the roller 803 rotates in the direction of an arrow c , the flange 205 rotate in the direction of an opposite arrow dl in Fig. 10 due to the abovedescribed pressure contact. The photoelectric sensor 804 is arranged at a proper position on a straight horizontal line passing through the center axis of the suction assembly 201 located in the second station II. The sensor 804 detects presence of the sliced fringe 5 and the seam lines 3a and 4a on the incomplete pantyhose 7a held on the suction assembly 205 in the second stationII. As the sensor 804 detects presence of the sliced fringe 5, its electric detection signal drives the motor 802 for rotation. The motor 802 ceases its rotation, however, as the sensor 804 detects presence of the seam lines 3a and 4a. In other words, the sensor 804 detects presence of the sliced fringe 5 when the seam lines 3a and 4a are off the straight line g and the motor 802 is driven for rotation. As a consequence, the roller 803 rotates in the direction c and the flange 205 in the direction d . As the seam lines 3a and 4a meet the straight line X, the sensor 804 detects this end the motor 802 ceases its rotation. When she seam lines 3a and 4a are on the straight line X fron the beginning, the motor 802 does not rotate at all.In either case, the seam lines 3a and 4a are registered at the straight line 5 by the sensor 804 before the sliced fringe 5 and the fringe of the gore piece 10 are superimposed. 7 The sewing machine 601. The sewing machine 601 is arranged in the third stationIII in order to seam the sliced fringe 5 of the incomplete panty hose 7a held by the suction assembly 201 with the fringe of the gore piece 10. The construction is shovm in Fig. 8. At the moment the suction assembly 201 with the incomplete panty hose 7a and the gore piece 10 arrives at the third station III after its travel along the guide plate 423, the gore piece 10 is in the horizontal state but the sliced fringe 5 is fclea over the suction tube bottom flange 205.Prior to starting of the seaming operation, the sliced fringe 5 needs to be returned to the horizontal state for snug superimposition with the fringe of the gore piece 10. This flattening is carried out on the sewing table 603. One example of such flattening is carried out by an air ejection nozzle 604 arranged new the sewing machine 601 with its ejection mouth closely facing the outer wall of the suction tube bottom flange 205. Air blow by the nozzle 604 flattens the sliced fringe 5 on the gore piece 10. Another example of such flattening is carried out by an air suction nozzle 605 located at an upstream position of a sewing neeedle 601a on the sewing machine 601. Air suction by the nozzle 605 flattens the sliced fringe 5 on the gore piece 10. These air nozzles 604 and 605 may be used in combination. It is also feasible to arrange these air nozzles 604 and 605 at the second station II in order to practice the flattening of the sliced fringe just after transfer of the gore piece 10 to the suction assembly 201. In this case, however, there is a likelihood that the once flattened sliced fringe 5 may loose its correctly superimposed state due to any unexpected shock two be caused during its travel to the third station III with the suction assembly 201. In order to avoid such a trouble, it is rather advantageous to carry out the flattening of the sliced fringe 5 at the third station III. 8 The removing assembly 701. The complete panty hose 7 formed at the third station III is removed off the suction assembly 201 at the fourth station IV in order to be discharged outside the system. The removing assembly 701 is shoYun in detail in Fig. 3. One end of a delivery pipe 703 is coupled to the circular hole 123 see Fig. 6 in the cover disc 120. The other end of the delivery pipe 733 is provided with a delivery mouth 704. A pair o f vertical ly spaced brackets 705 are disposed to the cover disc 120 and the oPeration table 102 in axial res cecthvely, in order to hold a suction pipe 706 vertically. This connection holds the cover disc 120 inmovable with respect to the main shaft 103 which rotates intermittenlly. The upstream end of this suction pipe 706 is coupled to the suction tube 108 with the downstream end to the delivery mouth 704. Thus, pneumatic suction acts on the complete pantyhose 7 within the suction tube 201 via the suction pipes 108 and 706, the delivery mouth 704, the delivery pipe 7C3 and the circular hole 123. As a consequence the complete panty hose 7 is discharged outside the system via the circular hole 123, the delivery pipe 703 and the delivery mouth 704. Operation of the automatic seaming apparatus in accordance with the present invention and equipped with the abovedescribed assemblies is as hereinafter described, reference being made to Figs. 9A through 9E. In the first station I, pneumatic suction acts on a suction assembly 201 by manual switching so that, as shown inFig. 9A, the leg sections of an incomplete panty hose 7a are sucked into the suction tube 203 and the inside thigh sliced fringe 5 is manually folded over the bottom flange 205. Even after the pneumatic suction is intercepted, the incomplete panty hose 7a is held on the suction assembly 201 by the hooks 206 see Fig. 2 .The suction assembly 20then travels ttiwards the second station II whilst carrying the incomplete panty hose 7á as shovm in l igo 9B In the second station II, the feeder assembly 301 passes a sheet of gore piece 10 cut into a prescribed shape onto one double drum 410 of the transfer assembly 401. Thereafter, the valve 426 is rendered open in order to suck the gore piece to the top face o the associated semi circular plate 408.In synchronism with the travel of the suction assembly 201 to the second station II, the double drum 410 revolves about the axis of the support shaft 405 over 180 degrees and is registered at a position below and in axial alignment with the suction assembly 201 arrived at the second station II. Further, by operation of the direction adjuster assembly 800, the angular position of the sliced fringe 5 on the bottom flange 205 is adjusted with respect to the gore piece 10. At this moment, the valve 426 is closed in order to cancel the pneumatic suction working on the gore piece 10 on the sea circular plate 408 and the pneumatic cylinder 415 starts to lift the double drum 410, thereby placing the gore piece 10. on the semi circular place 408 into pressure contact with the bottom of the sliced fringe 5 on the flange 205 as shown in Fig. 9C. Concurrently with this procedure, the heat cut assembly 501 forms cuts in the sliced fringe 5. As these operations are complete, the suction assembly 201 with the incomplete panty hose 7a travels towards the third station III. The gore piece 10 on the semi circular plate 408 in the lifted position slides towards the sewing table 603 along the guide plate 423 due to the above described pressure contact. In the third station III, the sliced fringe 5 is turned back to the horizontal state by operation of the air ejection nozzle 604 and or the air suction nozzle 605 in order to be superimposed on the fringe of the gore piece 10. At this moment, the suction tube driver assembly 50 operates to rotate the suction tube 203 with the incomplete panty hose 7a and the gore piece 10 over 360 degrees so that the sewing machine 601 seams the sliced fringe 5 together with the fringe of the gore piece 10. This procedure is shovin in Fig. 9D. Concurrently with this seaming, the surplus sections of the sliced fringe 5 and the gore piece 10 are cut off and a complete panty hose 7 such as shown in Fig. 9E is obtained which includes an almost round gore lOa seamed to its thigh section along the seam line 8. As the seaming is complete, the suction assembly 201 travels towards the fourth station IV whilst carrying the complete panty hose 7 inside. The removing assembly 701 thereupon operates to remove the panty hose 7 off the suction assembly 201 and discharge outside the system. In accordance with the present invention almost all operations are carried out quite automatically expect for the initial manual attachiment of the incomplete panty hose to the suction assembly in the first station. This naturally results in remarkable saving in labour, high production efficiency and low production cost. Operations done by the automatic assemblies assures production of panty hoses of uriforni quality and shape. limited application of pneumatic suction only in the first station for holding of the incomplete panty hose results in reduced power consumption and simple piping for the pneumatic system. As the suction assemblies travel along a circular endless path, the apparatus is very compact in construction and less space is necessary for its installation.
