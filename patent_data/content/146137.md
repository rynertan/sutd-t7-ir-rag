# Molding process using room temperature curing silicone coatings to provide multiple release of articles.

## Abstract
An improved molding process is provided which com prises treating a mold surface with certain curable silicone compositions to improve the release of molded articles from the mold. The silicone mold release composition is ob tained by mixing predominately hydroxyl terminated polydi methylsiloxane, an alkoxysilane such as methyltrimethoxy silane, a metal alkoxide such as tetraalkyltitanate and a non reactive, volatile solvent. The composition is stable if stored in containers that exclude moisture, but cures when exposed to moisture. Molds with surfaces coated by these compositions provide easy release of many successively molded articles such as high resiliency polyurethane foam cushions for automobiles.
