## Description
Process for the extraction of 3 amylase from grainsThe present ivention relates to a process for the preparation of pure raw extract of ss amylase from grains, especially from grains of barley.ss amylase is a starch hydrolyzing anzyme developed in grain during the growth period and stored therein. The best known and studied is ss amylase of barley for its major importance in brewing industrv. D.E. Briggs Barley , Chapman Hall, London, 1978 Cook Barley and Malt11, Academic Press, London, 1862, J.R.A. Pollock Brewing ScienceAcademic Press, London, 1979 .There are two types of ss amylase preparation on the market, those based on grain and bacteria. A difference between them is e.g. tine composition of starch hydrolysis products. A hydrolysis catalyzed by bacteria based 5 amylases produces 15 30 of maltotriose andDO 60 of maltose, while grain based ss amylases produce vainly maltose. Therefore, a starch hydrolyzed by the grain based ss amylase has increased sweetness and ability to serve as a nutrient of yeast.The most important applicatios of ss amylase are found in brewing and starch industries. If there is not available a malt with sufficient entymatic activities for mashing, the defect can be overcome by the addition of e.g. ss amylase. Enzyme additions are necessary when using unmalted grain for mashing. Effecting the hydrolysis of starch with a grain based ss amylase will result in sweet, maltose rich products which can be employed e.g. as a raw material of beer and in the production of sweets. In confectioney industry, it is possible to substitute such maltose rich syrup for some of the saccharose, since the syrup is inherently very sweet indeed. The above cited literature, its references and publication DE AS 1 792 362 disclose a plurality of methods for the separation of 0 amylase from grains and components thereof. A common feature of all these methods is that the grain is initially ground or crushed or that the starting material comprises some mechanically separated component of grain, such as bran. From these starting materials ss amylase is extracted with water, a buffer solution etc., whereby the obtained raw extrate contains, together with ss amylase, a lot of other soluble grain ingredients which leads to a very arduous purification and concentration of enzyme.Since the hull layers of a grain are semi permeable and since ss amylase is found relatively near the hull, in the subaleurone layer of a grain, studies were initiated to find out whether it is possible to extract ss amylase from a whole grain as it was presuree that, with the grain s own membranes acting as a kind of filter, it would be possible to obtain already at the raw extract stage a preparation of substantially improved purity compared to these extracted from flour or grit.It was unexpectedly discoverer tat 60 80 of the total amount of 3 amylase can be extracte rc z grain by the process of the invention in such a manner that the extraction is effected from whole or partially hulled grain, the weight of removed hull material being 0 20 of the weight of a grain, the extraction temperature being 20 55 C, and the extraction period exceeding 5 hours.The amount, purity and extraction period of the ss amylase to be extracted from grain can be controlled by chanciinc t temperature which effects on the permeability and rate of diffusion of the gain membranes, Temperature is preferably within the rane of fro. 20 to 550C. Another means of control is partial removal of the outermost hull layers of a grain by applying e.g. the technique known from rice hulling, thus obtaining the desired permeability for the grain membranes. A preferred result is achieved by removing circa 10 of the total weight of a grain, preferably barley, as a hull material in such a manner that endosperm remains intact.In this process, the outermost layers of the grain endosperm serve as a kind of ultrafilter preventing entirely the passage of insoluble impurities into the leaching water and also substantially restricting the amount of soluble compounds. The obtained 0 amylase containing extract can be readily concentrated e.g.by ultrafiltration.It is preferable to use in the extraction some reducing agent e.g. SO2 for liberating ss amylase from other pro.ei.s, this process being known in the literature. The invention will now be illustrated in more detail by means of the following examples. Example 1 100 g of unhulled barley was leached in 300 ml of 0,5 i Na metabisulphite at 300C. Activity of leached ss amylase was observe as a function of time tables . Activity determinations were carried out by modified Bendelow method Bendelow, W.M. Journal of Institute of Brewing, No. 69, p. 467 473 . The unit applied was a relative unit U specific activity of around barley was rarked as 100 U g of protein . All determina sns were effected from filtered samples. A 100 activity was meant by the amount of ss amylase which in corresponding conditions dissolves from groung barley in 18 hours.

In this case the.purity of pss amylase is at least 156 98 183 98 or 1.59 1.87 times higher with respect to protein and 65 29 78 29 or 2.24 2.6 time higher with respect to total dry matter example 4 .Further purification of ss amylase can be effected bv applying any conventional technique, such as spray drying, ultrafiltration, precipitation etc. Since the purity of raw extract can be substantially improved by the present process, the above procedures will be facilitated accordingly.
