# Vacuum formable water cooling tower film fill sheet with integral spacers.

## Abstract
A vacuum formable film fill sheet for cross flow water cooling towers is disclosed having a repeating chevron pattern defining a series of zig zag, serpentine, spaced ridges on op posed faces of the sheet with the ridges on one face of the sheet defining the grooves on the opposite face thereof and vice versa. The formed sheets are located in upright, horizon tally spaced relationship between the overlying hot water dis tribution basin of the tower and the cold water basin thereof for generally horizontal flow of air past films of water flowing downwardly over the fill sheets. The angularity of the straight ridge sections of the chevron pattern with respect to one an other, the vertical height of each repeat pattern, the transverse angularity of the ridges and the spacing between adjacent sheets has been unexpectedly found to provide significantly improved results as compared with prior chevron pattern fill sheets. A series of integral, spaced, transversely W shaped spacers projecting in opposite directions from each of the sheets have notches in the intermediate V wall portions which complementally receive the outer foot portions of each spacer to maintain adjacent sheets in required horizontally spaced re lationship. The spacers are inclined at angles which provide minimum interference with air flow and are oppositely inclined for required complemental interfit with the spacer of an adja cent fill sheet.
