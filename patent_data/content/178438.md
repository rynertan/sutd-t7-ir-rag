The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound according to the invention by reaction of a 2 substituted benzimidazole with a substituted pyridine or pyrimidine wherein the substituents on the two compounds react to provide a linkage of the formula IV S O nCHR8 Iv with the sulphur atom on the 2 position of the benzimidazole nucleus, where n and R8 have the meanings given above, and, if desired or required, providing or removing other substituents in or from the resulting compound and, if desired or required, removing protective groups from other substituents on the resulting compound and, if desired or required, oxidizing or reducing the resulting compound, and, if desired or required, converting a free base into an acid addition salt, or quaternizing or solvating the resulting compound.Examples of the reaction are reactions in which a the benzimidazole is a 2 thiol and the pyridine or pyrimidine carries a CHR8R31group, where R31 is a leaving group, especially one displaceable by a nucleophile, and R8 has the meaning given above b the benzimidazole carries at the 2 position a group of the formula S O H2R8 or S O CHR8R32 where R has the meaning given above and R32 is a cationic substituent and the pyridine or pyrimidine carries a leaving group, especially one displaceable by a nucleophile or c the benzimidazole is 2 substituted by a leaving group, especially one displaceable by a nucleophile, and the pyridine or pyrimidine carries a group of the formula CH2R8 or CHR8SR32, where R8 and R32 have the meaning given above.The leaving group R31 may be, for example, a halogen atom, for example chlorine, bromine or iodine, or a labile acyloxy group, for example 0SO2CE3 orOS02p C6H4CH31 as may the leaving group on the pyridine or pyrimidine in Reaction b and that on the benzimidazole in Reaction c the latter may alternatively be a carboxylic acyloxy group, for example an alkanoyloxy group having from 1 4 carbon atoms.The cationic substituent R32 in Reaction b or c is advantageously an alkali metal, for example, potassium, sodium or lithium in Reaction c it may however be, for example, a tetraalkylammonium group, eg., the tetraethylammonium group.Reaction a , b , or c is generally affected at a moderate temperature, for example, a moderately elevated temperature, e.g., solvent reflux temperature, for example 50 to 1500C, especially 75 to IOOOC, in an inert solvent, preferably in the presence of an acid acceptor. The acceptor is suitably an inorganic acid acceptor, for example a strong base, e.g., sodium hydride, potassium t butoxide, butyl lithium or lithium diisopropylamide a moderately strong base for example sodium hydroxide or a moderate base for example calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate, In some cases the moderate base acid acceptor may suitably be an organic base, for example, a tertiary amine, e.g., triethylamine, trimethyiamine, pyridine or picoline.The appropriate acceptor depends on the particular reaction and, it will be appreciated, may provide the cationic substituent R32 mentioned above. For example, for Reaction b a strong base is appropriate. For reaction a a moderately strong base or moderate base is appropriate, while for Reaction c a moderate base is adequate.The inert solvent may be any solvent inert to both reactants and appropriate to the leaving group, the acid acceptor if present and desired reaction temperature. Suitable solvents include lower alkanols, for example, ethanol, dioxan, dimethyl formamide DMF , toluene, diethyl ether, or methylene chloride.For Reaction a in particular suitable solvents include polar solvents, for example, DMF or ethanol.Where reaction is effected in the presence of a base which is insoluble in the polar solvent, water, may be added to the solvent. Reaction is generally effected at moderately elevated temperatures as mentioned hereinbefore, for example, reaction mixture reflux temperature or at about 1000C, if lower. It will be appreciated that when the compound of the invention to be produced is to contain an unsubstituted amino group, such a group will generally be protected, during at least the main reaction of the invention, by a conventional N protecting group, for example, an acyl group, e.g., acetyl or phthaloyl. Protection may be effected by reaction with an acylating agent, for example the relevant acyl chloride or anhydride. The protecting group may be removed, for example, by base hydrolysis of an acetyl protecting group or treatment of a phthalimide protecting group with hydrazine hydrate in a lower alkanol, such as ethanol. Advantageously, the process results in a compound of the formula I, and preferably in a compound of the formula II or of formula III.If the reaction produces a compound of the formula I wherein n is 0 and a compound of the formula I is desired wherein n. 1, it is necessary to oxidize the compound resulting from the reaction.Such oxidation may be carried out, for example, at below ambient temperatures in non aqueous solvent, for example, a chlorinated hydrocarbon using, for example, an organic peracid, e.g., 3 chloroperbenzoic acid, or in water in the presence of a soluble strong inorganic oxidant, for example hydrogen peroxide.It will be realized that this process may alsoN oxidize any tertiary amino moiety and suitable precautions should be taken if it is desired to avoid this.Conversely, reduction is required if the reaction produces a compound of the formula I in which m is 1 and a compound in which n is 0 is required.It will be apparent that compounds of the formula I containing a substituent which is convertible to another substituent wherein the resulting compound is of the formula I are useful novel intermediates.Numerous such conversions are possible not only for the end compounds of formula I, but also for their intermediates as follows a an acyl substituent is convertible to a hydrogen atom, or a diacyl substituent is convertible to two hydrogen atoms, by deacylation b a hydrogen atom is convertible to an acyl substituent, or two hydrogen atoms are convertible to a diacyl substituent, by acylationt c an alkyl substituent is convetible to a hydrogen atom, or a dialkyl substituent is convertible to two hydrogen atoms, by dealkylation d a hydrogen atom is convertible to an alkyl substituent, or two hydrogen atoms are convertible to a dialkyl substituent by alkylation.In a and b , the terms acyl and diacyl respectively include all the radicals and diradicals derivable from mono and dibasic acids, whether carboxylic or non carboxylic.In a , deacylation is desirably carried out by treatment with a base, for example, an alkali metal hydroxide.In b , the acylation is desirably carried out with an acylating agent, for example the corresponding acid anhydride or dianhydride or acid chloride or dichloride. Formylation is desirably carried out with formic acid.In c and d the term alkyl includes substituted alkyl, for example, phenylalkyl, especially phenyl lower alkyl. In c , dealkylation is advantageously carried out conventionally with a base, for example an alkali metal hydroxide, or, when R2 or R3 is benzyl, by hydrogenolysis using, for example, conventional transition metal catalyzed hydrogenolysis.In d , alkylation is advantageously effected conventionally with an alkylating agent, for example, the corresponding labile ester, for example the mesylate or tosylate, or diester or the corresponding halide, for example, the bromide, or dihalide. For R9 e hydrogen is desirably converted to acyl by conventional acylation. f an acyl group is desirably converted to hydrogen by conventional deacylation.In e , N acylation is desirably carried out under conventional conditions with an acylating agent which has an acyl group capable of forming a hydrolyzable acyloxy group and a leaving group, for example halide, e.g., chloride and bromide, and hydrogen. When halide is the leaving group, the reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a base. Nihen hydrogen is the leaving group, the reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a dehydrating agent, at a moderate temperature, such as ambient temperature.In f , deacylation is desirably carried out by treatment with a base, e.g., an alkali metal hydroxide. For R10 to R13 g a hydrogen atom is convertible to a nitro substituent by nitration. h a hydrogen atom is convertible to a halo substituent by halogenation i an amino substituent is convertible to a halo, cyano, or hydrogen substitute n by diazotisation and simultaneous nitrogen elimination with halogenation, cyanation, or reduction. j a carboxy substituent is convertible to an alkoxycarbonyl substituent by esterification.In g , nitration is advantageously carried out in accordance with known procedures.In h halogenation is advantageously carried out with conventional halogenating agent, under conventional reaction conditions for the halogenation of aromatic nuclei, for example, with the relevant halogen in the presence of Lewis acid catalyst, for example ferric chloride, zinc chloride or boron trifluoride, in an inert organic solvent, for example chloroform or dichloromethane, at a temperature below ambient acetic acid without a catalyst, may be used. i may be effected, for example, by treating the reaction product with nitrite and a strong inorganic acid in aqueous solution at 10 to 100C. Subsequent simultaneous nitrogen elimination and halogenation, cyanation or reduction may be effected by treating the diazotisation product with a halide, cyanide or hydride source, under either Sandmeyer orSchiemann reaction conditions for halide and nitrile, or by treatment with hypophosphorous acid for hydride respectively. j may be effected entirely conventionally.Conversions a to j are only exemplary and are not exhaustive of the possibilities.In general, interconversion of R4, R5 and R6 to other R4, R5 and R6 will not be effected. However, such interconversions as are possible, and suitable methods and conditions for effecting them, will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art.In all the foregoing interconversions, the effect, if any, on other substituents should be borne in mind, and such reagents as are appropriate should be selected together with the adoption of such routine precautionary measures as are necessary.It is however generally preferred that any conversions are carried out at the earliest stage possible in the synthesis.Salts of compounds of the formula I may generally be made in an entirely conventional manner by reacting a compound of the formula I in base form with a chosen acid to form acid addition salts. The quaternary derivatives of the compounds of the formula I may generally be prepared in conventional manner, such as by reaction of the chosen compound of the formula I with a compound R14Q wherein R14 and Q are as given above. This reaction is suitably carried out in an appropriate solvent, for example, acetone, methanol or ethanol.Salts of compounds of the formula I containing a carboxy group may generally be formed conventionally by reacting a compound of the formula I with a corresponding base, for example an alkali metal hydroxide, an alkaline earth metal hydroxide or an optionally substituted ammonium hydroxide. The preparation of intermediates for the above preparative processes may be effected by building up the intermediates in any given process by processes analogous to those in similar processes or by conventional oxidation as described hereinbefore for a compound of the formula I, or such intermediates are known compounds or are preparable analogously to or routinely derivable from known compounds.However, by way of example the preparation of various intermediates are as follows hereinafter In Reaction a , the 2 thiol may be prepared by treating an ortho diamino benzene with carbon disulphide or potassium ethyl xanthate see OrganicSyntheses, 1963 Collective Volume IV, 569 or by treating a benzimidazole having at the 2 position a group displaceable by a nucleophile with sodium sulphide. In Reaction b , the benzimidazole intermediate bearing a S O CHR8R32 group in the 2 position may be prepared by oxidizing, in the manner described above for a compound of formula I, a corresponding compound bearing a SCHR8R32 group. This compound may be prepared by conventional S alkylation of the 2 thiol.The invention accordingly also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable compound of the invention, in particular a compound of formula I, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or quaternized derivative thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate of any of the foregoing, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.The compositions may be formulated for administration by any route, although oral administration is preferred.

In preparing solutions the compound may be dissolved in water for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing.Advantageously, adjuvants, for example, a local anaesthetic, a preservative and buffering agents may be dissolved in the vehicle.

The perusate was forced over the surface of the secretory mucose only, the antrum being excluded.The effluent then passed over a microflow type glass pH electrode via a collecting funnel situated in the non glandular forestomach. The secretagogue carbachol or histamine was administered as a constant intravenous infusion to produce a stady rate of acid secretion. Test compounds were administered in solution as bolus intravenous injections and any effect on th pH of the perfusate noted. The perfusate Ph was recorded on a potentiometric recorder and anti secretory responses were measure in terms of the maximal reduction in hydrogen ion concentration expressed as a percentage of the control concentrations.
