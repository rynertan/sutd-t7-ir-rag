# Use of unsaponifiable residues of natural plant waxes for promoting plant growth.

## Abstract
A plant nutrient composition is obtained by extracting a complex fraction comprising a mixture of water insoluble long chain organic compounds from natural material espe cially from rice bran wax. The fraction is preferably obtained by saponifying rice bran wax and recovering the unsaponifi able residue. The fraction can be employed in dilute aqueous emulsion form as a foliar spray to enhance the growth and yield of many crops, such as rice, wheat and maize, especially in marginal agricultural areas.
