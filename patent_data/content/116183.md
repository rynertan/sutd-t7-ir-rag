# Pulse radar apparatus.

## Abstract
A pulse radar apparatus 2 for target 14 tracking is designed to provide angular error data about the deviations of gun fired 3 projectiles prevailing at the target with respect to the target position line. The I.f. signal processor of said radar apparatus comprises a. a signal analyser 17 with a filter bank for determining Doppler spectral components of echo signals received from the fired projectiles within the target range gate 23 and I.f. detected b. selection means 18 for selecting the projectile Doppler spectral components from the signal analyser 17 and filter bank and c. an angular error generator 24 for generating angular error data with the Doppler spectral components selected by the selection means 18 to correct gun aiming values calculated by a fire control computer 9 .
