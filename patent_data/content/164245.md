# NIF PROMOTER OF RHIZOBIUM JAPONICUM

## Abstract
There is disclosed a recombinant DNA plasmid comprising a vector and a promoter of a nitrogenase complex gene from a Rhizobium japonicum bacterium. The plasmid may additionally comprise a structural gene which may be a gene from a Rhizo bium species or a foreign gene inserted in such orientation and location as to be expressible under control of the promoter. Also disclosed are the nucleotide sequences of nifH and nifD promoters which may be used in the plasmid of the inven tion.
