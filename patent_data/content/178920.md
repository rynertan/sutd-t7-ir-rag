# A method of drying damp organic material.

## Abstract
Apparatus for drying damp material, such as pro teinaceous material, comprises a heat source and a rotating chamber. This chamber is formed from an inlet chamber 6 and a second chamber 10 . The temperature in the inlet chamber is high, whereas the temperature in the second chamber is lower and the material to be dried is held in the hot inlet chamber for a shorter period of time than the cooler second chamber in which it is held before the dried product is recovered from an outlet end 12 .
