# LIQUID DISTRIBUTING APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR A LIQUID VAPOR CONTACT COLUMN

## Abstract
Improved liquid distributors for use in vapor liquid con tact columns wherein uniform distribution of downflowing liquid is achieved by employing openings in the sides of vapor ducts and troughs, said openings being sized such that they remain submerged in the liquid in the trough. Im proved distribution is obtained when the openings are pro vided with adjacent vertical drip rods to which the liquid can adhere and follow downward. Improved liquid distribution is obtained at very low flow rates, e.g. less than 6,1lit min mÂ².
