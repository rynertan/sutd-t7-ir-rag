# SIGNAL CONTROLLED WAVEFORM RECORDER

## Abstract
A multi channel electronic waveform recorder for storing sampled waveform data and time of occurrence, information, i.e. a time tag , for each stored sample, is disclosed. Specifi cally, each channel 1, 2, 3...N of the waveform recorder converts a previously stored digital sample of a recorded waveform into an analog value, compares this value to the current value of the input signal 1a, 2a, 3a...Na , generates an analog difference signal in response to this comparison, and stores a digital sample substantially equivalent to the current value of the input signal whenever the magnitude of the dif ference signal exceeds a predetermined amount.
