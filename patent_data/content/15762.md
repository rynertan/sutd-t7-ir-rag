## Description
The present invention relates to catalyst systems for the conventional alpha olefin type polymerization at significantly improved polymerization activity, wherein the resultant polymers have a high degree of isotactic stereoregularity. An object of the present invention is to provide improved catalyst systems having a major increase in polymerization activity while being able to control over a wide range the polymer crystallinity, e.g., isotacticity, wherein the catalyst system includes a transition metal compound and a metal trialkyl compound of Al, Ga or In having at least one secondary or tertiary alkyl group. A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for alpha olefin type polymerizations, wherein the polymerization activity is increased and the formed polymer has a high degree of isotactic stereoregularity and a minimum amount of catalyst residues are formed. A still further object of .the present invention is to use directly the new improved catalyst with various types of supported transition metal compounds without substantial modification of the commercial catalyst preparation or the polymerization plant. A still further object of the. resent invention i to provide new improved catalyst compositions wherein the isotacticity of the formed polymer is much less sensitive to a ratio of the cocatalyst trialkyl metal compound to the transition metal compound than when the corresponding primary alkyl compounds are used, thereby greatly facili tating process control to make higher quality polymers at more efficient production rates. Additionally, another object of the present instant invention is to provide a process and compositions whereby R MR 2 or R2MR are produced as cocatalysts in situ by the reactions R2Mg R AlCl2 R2AlR MgC12 , or RMgX R 2AlCl RA1R 2 MgXCl It is well known in the art to use an alkyl metal compound of Groups I III in combination with a transition metal compound of Groups IVA VIII as a catalyst system for olefinic polymerization. While nearly all of the alkyl metal compounds are effective for the polymerization of ethylene, only a few are effective for the preparation of isotactic polymers of propylene and higher alpha olefins and only Et2AlC1, AlEt3 and i Bu2AlH have any important commercial utility. A major cost involved in the polymerization of the alpha olefins is the cost of the catalyst components.Therefore, the cost of the manufacture of the polymer can be effectively reduced by the use of catalyst systems having a higher polymerization activity. A further concern is the ability to produce polymers having a minimum amount of catalyst residues thereby eliminating a costly deashing operation.A still further concern is the ability to produce polymers having a high degree of isotactic stereoregularity thereby enabling the manufacturer to eliminate or reduce the costly operation involving the removal and separation of atactic polymer from the isotactic polymer. The improved catalyst system of the present invention provides a means for the manufacturer to obtain these desirable realizations. The improved catalyst systems of the present invention which are employed in alpha olefin polymerizations include a Group IVA VIII transition metal compound, one or more Lewis bases, and at least one metal alkyl compound at least one of which is a metal trialkyl compound of Al, Ga or In, wherein at least one of the alkyl groups is selected from the group consisting of C3 to C20 secondary or tertiary alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl or aralkyl groups. The transition metal catalyst compound is a Group IVA VIlI transition metal halide, wherein the halide group is chloride or bromide and the transition metal halide is in the form of solid crystalline compounds, solid solutions or compositions with other metal salts or supported on the surface of a wide range of solid supports. For highest stereospecificity it is desirable to have the transition metal halide, or its support composition, in the layer lattice structure with very small crystallites, high surface area, or sufficient defects or foreign components to facilitate high dispersion during polymerization. The transition metal halide may also contain various additives such as Lewis bases, pi bases, polymers or organic or inorganic modifiers.Vanadium and titanium halides such as VC13, VBr3, TiC 13, Tics4 TiBr3 or TiBr4 are preferred, most preferably TiC13 or TiC14 and mixtures thereof. The most preferred TiC13 compounds are those which contain TiC 14 edge sites on a layer lattice support such as alpha, delta, or gamma TiC 13 or various structures and modifications of TiC13, MgC12 or other inorganic compounds having similar layer lattice structures. The most preferred TiC14 compounds are those supported on chloride layer lattice compounds such as MgC12. Other anions may be also present, such as other halides, pseudo halides, alkoxides, hydroxides, oxides or carboxylates, etc., providing that sufficient chloride is available for isospecific site formation. Mixed salts or double salts such as K2Ticl6 or MgTiCl6 can be employed alone or in combination with electron donor compounds. Other supports besides MgC12 which are useful are hydroxychlorides, oxides or other inorganic or organic supports. The most preferred transition metal compound is TiC14 containing MgC12 especially in the presence of Lewis bases electron donor compounds . The Lewis bases can be employed in combination with the trialkyl metal compound or with the Group IVA VIII transition metal compound or with both components as long as they do not cause excessive cleavage of metal carbon bonds or loss of active sites. A wide variety of Lewis bases may be used including such types as tertiary amines, esters, phosphines, phosphine oxides, phosphates alkyl, aryl , phosphites, hexaalkyl phosphoric triamides, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl formamide, secondary amines, ethers, epoxides, ketones, saturated and unsaturated heterocycles, or cyclic ethers and mixtures thereof.Typical but nonlimiting examples are diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, methyl p toluate, ethyl p anisate, ethyl benzoate, phenyl acetate, amyl acetate, methyl octanoate, acetophenone, benzophenone, triethyl amine, tributylamine, dimethyl decylamine, pyridine, N methylpiperidine, 2,2,6,6, tetramethylpiperidine and the like. Especially useful in combination with the trialkyl metal cocatalyst areLewis bases whose complexing ability toward the cocatalyst is hindered sufficiently by steric and or electronic effects to cause appreciable dissociation of the trialkyl metalLewis base complex under polymerization conditions. Although a wide range of mole ratios may be used, dissociation measured on a 1 1 complex is normally in the range of 5 95 , preferably greater than about 10 and less than 90 . Steric hindrance is achieved by bulky substituents around the heteroatom which reduces the accessibility of the base functionality to the Lewis acid, that is, the trialkyl metal compound. Electronic hindering is obtained by placing electron withdrawing substituents on the heteroatom to reduce the electron density on the basic heteroatom. Aromatic substituents are especially useful because they are relatively unreactive toward other catalyst components. HinderedLewis bases derived from piperidines, pyrrolidines, ketones, tetrahydrofurans, secondary and tertiary aromatic amines and tertiary aliphatic amines are preferred, with the hindered nitrogen bases being most preferred.Non liminting examples of sterically hindered bases include 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine, 2,2,5,5 tetramethylpyrrolidine, 2,2,5,5,tetramethyltetrahydrofuran, di tert butylketone, 2,6 diisopropyl piperidine, ortho tolyl t butylketone, methyl 2,6 di tert butylphenylketone, diisopropylethylamine, t butyldimethylamine, 6 methyl 2 isopropyl pyridine, and the like, Electronically hindered Lewis bases include diphenylamine, di ortho tolylamine, N,N diethylaniline, di orthotolylketone, and the like. Since aromatic substituents are also bulky, some of the electronically hindered bases also have a steric contribution to the hindrance. Especially preferred hindered amines are 2,2,6 ,6, tetramethyl piperidine, 2,2,5,5 tetramethylpyrrolidine and the diarylamines.Completely hindered bases, such as 2,6 di tertiary butylpyridine, and the like, which complex the alkyl metal cocatalyst too weakly, are ineffective for improving stereospecificity and are excluded from this invention. Salts of Group lA IlIB metals may also be employed with theEMI5.1 catalysts if they are partially or wholly solubilized by reaction with the alkyl metal components.Particularly useful are the carboxylates, alkoxides and aryloxides of magnesium and aluminum. Non limiting examples include Mg OOCR 2, , R OMgOOCR , ClMgOR , Mg OR 2, R 2AlOOCC6H5, R A1 OOCR 2, R 2A1OR , and the like, whereR is a hydrocarbyl group. Most preferred are the alkoxide and carboxylate salts of magnesium and aluminum prepared in situ by reacting the organometal compounds with R OH or carboxylic acids in hydrocarbon solvents. Sterically hindered alkoxides and aryloxides are especially preferred, where R t butyl, t amyl, 1,1 diethylpropyl, l,l diethylbenzyl, 2,6 di tert butylphenyl, l,l diphenylpropyl, triphenylmethyl, and the like.These salts of Group IA IID are preferably used with the trialkyl metal compounds having the formula R11,3M wherein M 1 Al, Ga or In, and R is selected from the group consisting of a C1 C20 primary, secondary or tertiary alkyl, branched primary alkyl, cycloalcyl, alkenyl or aralkyl group and mixtures thereof, more preferably at least one alkyl group having at least two carbon atoms, and most preferably having 2 to 4 carbon atoms. The salt of theGroup lA IlIB metal is used at a molar ratio of 1 to 50 to 50 to 1 moles of the salt of Group IA II metal per mole of the trialkylaluminum compound R 3Al, preferably about 1 to 10 to 10 to l moles when the oxygen containing group is alkoxide or aryloxide.When the group is carboxylate, the ratio is 0.1 to 1, preferably 0.1 to 0.5 carboxylate groups per mole of the trialkyl metal compound. The use of these Group lA IlIB metal salts is preferably with the supported titanium catalyst systems as embodied in the present invention. The improved cocatalysts of the present invention have the general formula RnMR 3 n wherein M Al, Ga or In,R is selected from the group consisting of a C3 C20 secondary or tertiary alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl or aralkyl group, R is selected from the group consisting of C1 C20 primary alkyl, alkenyl or aralkyl or hydride and n 0 3, preferably 1 2, and most preferably n 2. Preferably, R is C2 C10 primary alkyl or aralkyl, or hydride most preferablyR is C2 C4 primary alkyl or hydride with the restriction that not more thanonehydride group may be present. The R group is preferably a C4 C16 secondary or tertiary alkyl group or cycloalkyl group and is most preferably one which is not readily susceptible to elimination or displacement by monomer during polymerization.In addition to the simple secondary alkyl groups, other groups are also effective in which the aluminum is attached to a secondary or tertiary carbon atoms, i.e., cyclohexyl, cyclooctyl, tertbutyl, tert amyl, s norbornyl, and the like. The most preferred compositions have the formula RnAlR 3 n in which the secondary and tertiary alkyl groups contain 4 10 carbons and n 2. Mixtures of the cocatalysts of this invention with conventional alkyl metal cocatalysts also yields improved results. Suitable non limiting examples include i Pr2AlEt, s BuAlEt2, s Bu2AlEt, t BuAlEt2, t Bu2AlEt, s Bu3Al, 1,1dimethylheptyl AlEt2, s Bu2Aln C16H33, t Bu2AlCH2C6H5, s Bu t Bu Aln Bu, cyclohexyl2AlEt, s pentyl Ali Bu2, t 3u2AlNe, t Bu2Aln C8H17, 2 ethylcyclopenyl 2AlEt, 2 3 ethylnorbornyl AlEt2, 2 norbornyl Ali Bu2, 2 norbornyl 2Ali Bu, acenaphthyl Ali Bu2, cyclooctyl i Bu A1H, 3 ethyl5 ethylidinenorbornyl AlEt2, 9 i bu 9 alumino 3,3,1 bicyclononane, s Bu2AlH, t Bu2AlH, t Bu2InEt, s Bu2GaEt, neopentylAlEt2, neopentyl2 AlEt and the like. Preferred compounds include those in the above list which have the formula R1 2AlR 2 1 The most preferred compounds in the above list have the formula R2AlR . One method of preparing these secondary alkyl aluminum compounds is to react internal olefins with AliBu3 or i Bu2AlH to add A1 H across the double bond to form alkyl aluminum compounds. When the double bond is in a strained ring compound, AlR3 may be used to add A1 R across the double bond and obtain preferred compounds which are very resistant to displacement or elimination. Strained ring olefins include cyclopentene, norbornene, norbornadiene, ethylidine norbornene, dicyclopentadiene, and the like. This method is preferred because of raw material availability and simplicity of reaction, although this invention is not limited by the method of synthesis. Other methods include the direct synthesis from the reactive metals and the secondary or tertiary halides, the various organometallic syntheses involving ligand exchange between Al, Ga or In compounds and secondary or tertiary alkyl metal compounds of more lelectropositive metals such as Groups IA and IIA, and the reaction of the metals with the alkyl mercury compounds. Particularly useful is the general reaction of secondary or tertiary alkyl lithium compounds with R MX2 or R 2EY because it takes place readily in dilute hydrocarbon solutions. Although di secondary alkyl aluminum compounds are preferred to mono secondary alkyl compounds, the monoalkyl types become more effective the greater the steric bulk of the group aF long as it does not interfere with active site formation or lead to decomposition under reaction conditions. For the alkyl metal cocatalysts of this invention, the most preferred transition metal compounds contain TiC 14 supported on MgC12 and one or more Lewis bases. The concentration of the transition metal in the polymerization zone is 0.001 to 5mM, preferably less than 0.hum. The molar ratio of the trialkyl metal compound to the transition metal compound is 0.5 1 to 200 1 or higher, more preferably 5 1 to 100 1. The molar ratio of Lewis base to organometal compound can vary widely but is preferably 0.1 1 to 1 1. However, the hindered Lewis bases may be added in greater than equimolar amounts, from 0.1 to 1 to 10 to 1 moles per mole of organometal compound, to obtain higher stereospecificity without a major loss of activity which would occur with unhindered bases. The catalyst system of the invention enables the process for making alpha olefin polymers having a high degree of isotactic stereoregularity to be carried out at a temperature of 250 to 1500C., more preferably 400 to 800C., at pressures of about 1 atm. to 50 atm. The reaction time for polymerization is 0.1 to 10 hours, more preferably 0.5 to 3 hours. Due to the high catalyst activity, shorter times and temperatures below 80 C. can be readily employed. The reaction solvent for the system can be any inert paraffinic, naphthenic or aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene, xylene, propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, excess liquid monomer is used as solvent. Gas phase polymerizations may also be carried out with or without minor amounts of solvent. Typical, but non limiting examples of C2 C20 alpha olefinic monomers employed in thE present invention for the manufacture of homo , co and terpolymers are ethylene, propylene, butene l, pentene l, hexene l, octadecene l, 3methylbutene l, styrene, ethylidene norbornene, 1,5 hexadiene and the like and mixtures thereof. Isotactic polymerization of propylene and higher olefins is especially preferred, including block copolymerizations with ethylene. The trialkyl metal compound and the supported transition metal compound can be added separately to the reactor or premixed before addition to the reactor, but are preferably added separately. Replacing the secondary or tertiary alkyl groups by bulky or hindered alkoxy, phenoxy or dialkylamide groups does not provide the improved catalyst activity achieved by the cocatalyst in this invention.EMI9.1 An alternative embodiment of the present invention with respect to the cocatalysts RnMR 3 n is to use directly the reaction product ofEMI9.2 as exemplified in U.S.Serial No. 790,832 orEMI9.3 RMR 2 MgXX as exemplified in French Specification 2380304 the present application being related to French Specification 2380303 and 2380304. In the case of the formation of R2MR , the metal di or trihalide compounds which are used are selected from the group consisting essentially of metal halide compound selected from the group consisting of R MX2, MX3 and mixtures thereof, where N is selected from the group consisting of Al, Ga, and In, R is selected from the group consisting of C1 to C20 primary alkyl, alkenyl or aralkyl groups or hydride X is selected from the group consisting of chloride, bromide or a monovalent anion which cannot initiate polymerization of olefinic monomers, wherein the anion is selected from the group consisting of alkoxide, phenoxide, thioalkoxide, carboxylate, etc. and mixtures thereof. Typical but non limiting examples are ethyl aluminum dichloride, aluminum trichloride, ethyl aluminum dibromide, ethyl chloroaluminum bromide, octylaluminum dichloride, ethyl indium dichloride, butyl aluminum dichloride, benzyl aluminum dichloride, ethyl chloroaluminum butoxide,and mixtures thereof.

Mixtures of diorganomagnesium compounds can be readily employed providing at least one secondary or tertiary group is present. The most preferred organic groups are secondary and tertiary alkyl groups, e.g. t Bu or s Bu. The molar ratio of the alkyl metal halide compound R4MX2 to the diorganomagnesium compound is 0.5 1 to 2 1, more preferably about 0.7 1, and most preferably 1 1. For the MX3 compound the ratio is 1 1 to 1 3, most preferably 2 3. The number of moles of Lewis base can vary widely but is preferably equal to or less than the sum of the moles of the metal halide compound and the diorganomagnesium compound. The molar ratio of the metal halide compound or the diorganomagnesium compound to the transition metal compound is less than 200 1 or higher and more preferably less than 100 1. The metal halide compound and diorganomagnesium compound can be added separately to the reactor containing the transition metal compound but are preferably premixed before addition to the reactor. Employing either the metal halide compound or the diorganomagnesium compound alone with the transition metal compound does not provide the improved catalyst efficiency and stereospecificity as envisioned in this application. In order to attain this, it is necessary to employ both the metal halide compound and diorganomagnesium compound in combination with the transition metal compound in the critical proportions as previously defined.The concentration of the transition metal in the polymerization zone is 0.001 to 5mM, preferably less than 0.lmM. In the case of the formation of RMR 2, the metal alkyl compounds which are used are selected from the group consisting essentially of a metal alkyl compound selected from the group consisting of R 2MX or R 3M and mixtures thereof, wherein M is selected from the group consisting of Al, Ga and In, R is selected from the group consisting of C1 to C20 primary alkyl, alkenyl, aralkyl or hydride groups X is selected from the group consisting of a monovalent anion which cannot initiate polymerization of olefins, such as F, C1, Br, OR , SR , and OOCR , wherein R is selected from the group consisting of C1 to C20 alkyl, branched alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, naphthenic, aralkyl and alkenyl groups, X is more preferably C1 or Br and most preferablyC1.Typical but non limiting examples are diethyl aluminum chloride, aluminum triethyl, diethylaluminum bromide, diethylaluminum iodide, diethylaluminum benzoate, diisobutylaluminum hydride, dioctylaluminum chloride, diethylgallium butoxide, diethylindium neodecanoate, triethylindium, dibenzylaluminum chloride and mixtures thereof. Mixtures of metal alkyl compounds can be readily employed. The C2 C4 alkyl aluminum compounds are preferred for high stereospecificity, and the dialkyl aluminum chlorides are most preferred.

Typical, but non limiting examples are s BuMgCl, t BuMgC1, s BuMgOOCC6H5, or s BuMgOC15H31, and mixtures thereof. Mixtures of organomagnesium compounds can be readily employed. The most preferred X groups are OR and OOCR and the most preferred R groups are secondary or tertiary alkyls. The molar ratio of the organomagnesium RMgX compound to the metal allyl compound R 2MX or R 3M is 2 1 to 1 2, most preferably 1 1. The number of moles of Lewis base can vary widely but is preferably equal to or less than the sum of the moles of the metal alkyl compound and the organomagnesium compound. The molar ratio of the metal alkyl compound or the organmmagnesium compound to the transition metal compound is less than 200 1 or higher and more preferably less than about 100 1. The metal alkyl compound R 2MX or R 3M and organomagnesium compound RMgX can be added separately to the reactor containing the transition metal compound but are preferably premixed before addition to the reactor.Employing either the metal alkyl compound or the organomagnesium compound alone with the transition metal compound does not provide the improved catalyst efficiency and stereospecificity as envisioned in this application. In order to attain this, it is desirable to employ both the metal alkyl compound and organomagnesium compound in combination with the transition metal compound in the proportions previously defined. The concentration of the transition metal in the polymerization zone is about 0.001 to about 5mM, preferably less than about 0.1mM. The advantages of the catalyst system and the process for the alpha olefin polymerizations of the . instant invention can be more readily appreciated by reference to the following examples and tables. EXAMPLE 1 An aluminum alkyl compound containing both secbutyl and ethyl groups was prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of sec butyl 2Mg 0.16 Et20 and ethyl aluminum dichloride in heptane, heating to 650C., 15 min., separating the magnesium chloride solids and vacuum stripping the clear solution. NMR analysis indicated the composition sBu2AlEt 0.45t2O. Metals analysis showed that only 0.50 Mg was present in this fraction. The above liquid alkyl aluminum compound 0.2 g was used as cocatalyst with 0.2 g catalyst prepared by reacting anhydrous MgC12 5 moles with TiC14 C6H5COOEt 1 mole in a ball mill 4 days, followed by a neat TiC14 treat at 800C., 2 hours, washed with heptane and vacuum dried. The catalyst contained 2b68 Ti. Propylene was polymerized in 500 ml n heptane at 65 C., 1 hour at 765770mm. Polymerization rate was 130 g g catalyst hour and the polymer insoluble in boiling heptane 97.6 .EXAMPLE 2 Three alkyl aluminum compounds containing sec butyl groups were prepared by reacting the proper stoichiometric amounts of sec butyl lithium in heptane with either ethyl aluminum dichloride or diethylaluminum chloride, heating to boiling, filtering the insoluble LiCl, and vacuum stripping the clear solutions. Nearly theoretical yields were obtained of s BuEtAlCl A , s Bu2EtAl B and s BuEt2Al C .Compositions were established by 1H and 13C NMR and by G.C.analysis of the alkyl fragments. Polymerizations were carried out as in Example 1 using 1 mmole aluminum alkyl compound and 0.2 g of the supported TiC14 catalyst. The results summarized in TableI are compared to those obtained using the control ethyl aluminum compounds. In all three runs with sec butyl alkyls, both activity and stereospecificity heptane insolubles were higher than those obtained with the conventional ethyl aluminum compounds. The trialkyls were far superior to the dialkyl aluminum chlorides and the di sec butyl aluminum ethyl was clearly superior to the mono sec butyl aluminum diethyl compound.

The solution was vacuum stripped at 250C., yielding 28.1 g of the neat sec pentyl aluminum compound. Propylene was polymerized as in Example 2 using 0.212 g 1 mmole sec pentyl aluminum diisobutyl as cocatalyst. Polymerization rate was 383 g g Cat hr and Hi 92.7. Comparison with AlEt3 control Ex. 2, Run C shows that the sec pentyl aluminum compound gave substantial improvement, particularly in stereospecificity.EXAMPLE 4 The alkyl metal cocatalysts of the invention are particularly advantageous in having a much smaller effect of concentration or alkyl metal Ti on stereospecificity, thereby simplifying plant operation and permitting better control of product quality. The results are summarized inTable II for di sec butyl aluminum ethyl in contrast toAlEt3 using the propylene polymerization procedure ofExample 2.

Structures were shown by 1 and C NMR to be the expected addition products of A1 H or Al Et across the norbornene double bond. These mono and di secondary alkyl aluminum compounds were used in propylene polymerization following the procedure of Example 2.

Comparison with the AlEt3 control Run C, Example 2 shows that all of the secondary norbornyl aluminum alkyls gave markedly higher heptane insolubles while retaining high activity.EXAMPLE 6 Sec alkyl aluminum hydrides also give improved results compared to the closely related primary alkyl aluminum hydride i Bu2A1H , following the procedure ofExample 2.

The catalyst contained 3.44 Ti. Run 0 using sec butyl groups gave higher activity and stereospecificity than Run N using the closely related, but primary, isobutyl groups4 Improved results are also seen versus the AlEt3 control using the same supported titanium catalyst Example 2, Run C . Runs R and S show substantially higher heptane insolubles using two different sec butyl aluminum hydrides compared to control Runs P and 9 using AlEt3 and iBu3Al with the same catalyst.EXAMPLE 7 The procedure of Example 2 was followed except that various Lewis bases were mixed with the aluminum alkyl solution before charging to the reactor.

Activity is decreased somewhat, but it is still 305 times that of the Et2AlCl TiC13 0.33AlC13 commercial catalyst rate 20, HI 93 . At somewhat lower base concentrations, activity is 10 20 times higher than the commercial catalyst while still achieving 1 2 higher heptane insolubles.EXAMPLE 8 Following the procedures of Example 2 and Example 7, improved stereospecificity is also obtained using tBu2InEt cocatalyst.EXAMPLE 9 The procedure of Example 6, Runs P S was followed except that 9 i Bu 9alumino 3,3,l bicyclononane was used as cocatalyst. Polymerization rate 97.5 g g catalyst hour HI 85.1 .EXAMPLE 10 The procedure of Example 9 was followed except that t Bu2Al n octyl was used as cocatalyst. The rate was 212 g g catalyst hour HI 93.C . EXAMPLE 11 Polymerizations were carried out in a 1 liter baffled resin flask fitted with an efficient reflux condenser and a high speed stirrer. In a standard procedure for propylene polymerizations, 475 ml n heptane 1 ppm water containing 10 mmole Et2AlCl 1.20 g , or the mixture of cocatalysts, was charged to the reactor under dry N2, heated to reaction temperature 650C. and saturated with pure propylene at 765 mm pressure. The TiC13 1.00 g 6.5 mmole was charged to a catalyst tube containing a stopcock and a rubber septum cap. Polymerization started when the TiC 13 was rinsed into the reactor with 25 ml n heptane from a syringe. Propylene feed rate was adjusted to maintain an exit gas rate of 200 500 cc min at a pressure of 765 mm.After one hour at temperature and pressure, the reactor slurry was poured into one liter isopropyl alcohol, stirred 2 4 hours, filtered, washed with alcohol and vacuum dried. The TiC 13 was prepared by reduction of TiC 14 withEt2AlCl followed by treatment with diisopentyl ether and TiC14 under controlled conditions, yielding a high surface area delta TiC13 having low aluminum content. The sec butyl magnesium in Runs B,D and E was obtained from Orgmet and contained 72 non volatile material in excess of the s Bu2Mg determined by titration. IR, NMR and GC analyses showed the presence of butoxide groups and 0.07 mole diethyl ether per s Bu2Mg. A second sample of S Bu 2Mg was used in Runs G and I. It was substantially pure s Bu2Mg but contained 0.33 mole diethyl ether per s Bu2Mg Table VI .

Comparison of P uns B,D,E,G, and I with their respective control runs A,C,F and H shows that each type of TiCi3 catalyst the novel cocatalyst combination gave 2 10 times higher activity than the customary Et2AlCl cocatalyst. The percent heptane insolubles HI decreased substantially using the new cocatalysts. Thus, these high activity catalysts are attractive for making low crystallinity homopolymers of propylene and higher alpha olefins.They are particularly attractive for making thermoelastic polymers and amorphous copolymers and terpolymers for elastomers.EXAMPLE 12 A titanium catalyst containing MgC12 was prepared by dry ball milling 4 days a mixture of anhydrous MgC12 1 mole , TiC14 1 mole and o TiC13 0.1 mole . Propylene was polymerized using the conditions in Example 11, Run B and the quantities shown in Table VII. Activity with the cocatalysts of this invention Run L was intermediate between those of the AlEt3 and AlEt2Cl controls Runs J andK , but the stereospecificity as shown by HI was much higher than the controls. The large increase in HI obtained with this MgC12 containing catalyst is in contrast to the results in Example 1 using TiC 13 catalysts in which activity increased sharply but HI decreased.

The catalyst contained 3.78 Ti. Propylene was polymerized following the procedure of Example 11, Run B except that supported catalyst was used. As shown in Table VIII, all the control runs N through S gave substantially lower activity and or HI than the AlEtCl2 s Bu2Mg combination Run T or A1C13 s Bu2Mg Run U . If the new cocatalysts simply reacted as the separate alkyl metal cdmpounds, the results should have been like Runs M Q. If the new cocatalysts simply reacted according to the equation AlRCl2 R2MgAlR2Cl RMgCl, then the results should have been like RunsN P. However, the results in Run T and U are dramatically better, showing the completely unexpected formation of R2AlR as previously defined. A much smaller synergistic effect was obtained by combining AlEt2Cl s Bu2Mg Run S , but the results were poorer than those obtained with AlEt3. Combining s Bu2Mg with AlEt3 Run R destroyed the activity shown by AlEt3 alone Run O . Thus, the outstanding results were obtained only when R2Mg was combined with RA1C12 or AlCl3.

In a standard procedure for propylene polymerizations, 475 ml n heptane 1 ppm water containing the alkyl metal cocatalysts was charged to the reactor under N2, heated to reaction temperature 650C. while saturating with propylene at 765 mm pressure. The powdered transition metal catalysts was charged to a catalyst tube such that it could be rinsed into the reactor with 25 ml n heptane from a syringe.

After one hour at temp erature and pressure, the reactor slurry was poured into 1 liter isopropyl alcohol, stirred 2 4 hours, filtered, washed with alcohol and vacuum dried. A titanium catalyst supported on MgC12 was prepared by combining 5 MgC12, 1 TiC14 and 1 ethylbenzoate, dry ball milling 4 days, heating a slurry of the solids in neat TiC14 2 hours at 800C., washing with n heptane and vacuum drying.

Comparison with control Run A, Example 29, shows that increased stereospecificity was obtained with all of the alkyl aluminum carboxylates except in Run 0. Higher activities were also obtained in some cases, especially with the 2,6 dimethylbenzoates Runs N and 0 . The ortho substituents are believed to hinder the carbonyl addition reaction which leads to lower activity by consumption of the aluminum trialkyl. Support for this type of side sanction can be seen in the low activity in Run P, premixed in concentrated solutions, compared to Run J which was pre mixed in 500 ml n heptane. when sufficient excess AiR3 is used in a concentrated premix with the aluminum benzoate, one regains activity, but the modifier is presumed to be the aluminum alkoxide products from the carbonyl addition reaction.Run R shows that the carboxylate compound alone is not a cocatalyst, so that the improved results obtained when mixed with AlR3 must be due to the reaction of the AlR3 with the carboxylate modifier.EXAMPLE 32 The procedure of Example 29 was followed except that tertiary butyl aluminum compounds were used and the ratio of aluminum trialkyl to aluminum benzoate was varied.

This was also true for Run Y versus its control Run Z . In this case, a large excess of alkoxide was used relative to the A1R3. These results are opposite to those using unsupported TiC13 catalysts in which it is known that dialkyl aluminum alkoxide cocatalysts produce low heptane insoluble products.EXAMPLE 34 The procedure of Example 33 was followed except that a hindered Lewis base 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine was used in addition to the alkoxide and another catalyst preparation was used which contained 3.38 Ti.
