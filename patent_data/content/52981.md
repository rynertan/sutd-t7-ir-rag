# Hall element circuit arranged to eliminate in phase voltage.

## Abstract
An in phase voltage elimination circuit in which a Hall element 11 has first and second control current input terminals 11a, 11b and first and second output terminals 11c, 11d . the first and second control current input termin als 11a, 11b fed with a control current and the first output terminal 11c connected to one input terminal of an operational amplifier 13 . The other input of the operational amplifier 13 is connected to ground, and the output terminal of the operational amplifier is connected to one of the first and second control current input terminals 11a, 11b . A Hall output is produced at the second output terminal 11d of the Hall element 13 .
