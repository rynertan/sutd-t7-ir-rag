# Process for the preparation of ethanol from methanol, carbon monoxide and hydrogen.

## Abstract
An integrated process for the preparation of ethanol from methanol, carbon monoxide and hydrogen feedstock is dis closed the process featuring the steps of esterifying methanol and acetic acid to form methyl acetate carbonylating the methyl acetate to form acetic anhydride esterifying acetic anhydride with a lower aliphatic alcohol in an anhydrous zone to form the corresponding aliphatic acetate hydrogenating the aliphatic ace tate in a second anhydrous zone to form ethanol and the corresponding aliphatic alcohol and separating the formed ethanol stream into an ethanol product stream and or aliphatic alcohol recycle stream, which is recycled to react with acetic anhydride.
