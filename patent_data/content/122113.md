# Method and arrangement for operating a cooling plant.

## Abstract
On board ships there are cooling systems of a kind com prising a heat exchanger 1 operating as a central cooler, through which sea water is pumped by means of a number of different pumps 2 5 . Fresh water intended for cooling of the main engine 21 of the ship and a lot of devices 15 18 of various kinds on board the ship, is pumped through the heat ex changer 1 to be cooled by the sea water. A by pass conduit 11 extends between the heat exchanger inlet conduit 9 and outlet conduit 10 for fresh water, and a threeway valve 12 is arranged to distribute the fresh water flow through the heat exchanger 1 and the by pass 11 in dependence upon the existing cooling demand of the main engine 21 and or said devices 15 18 for maintaining a predetermined temperature in the fresh water circuit. The invention resides in sensing the flow through the heat exchanger 1 , or the by pass conduit 11 , and in response thereto increasing or decreasing step wise the pump capacity for pumping sea water through the heat exchanger 1 .
