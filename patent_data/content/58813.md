# Electrochromic cell having a mixed solid ion conducting layer.

## Abstract
An electrochromic device comprises a layer of electrochromic tungsten oxide in contact with an ionconduc tive insulating layer of codeposited mixture of SiO and Cr₂O₃ between electrodes of reversible polarity for alternately coloring and erasing the electrochromic layer by alternate application of current in opposite directions. The mixture of components in the ionconductive layer improves cycling life of the device.
