# Multi level signal generating circuit.

## Abstract
A multi level signal generating circuit is disclosed which comprises a first CMOS inverter T₂, T₃ for invert ing an input signal to produce a first output signal having high and low voltage levels a second CMOS inverter T₆, T₇ for inverting the input signal to produce a second out put signal having high and low voltage levels at least one of the high and low voltage levels of the second output signals being different from said high and low voltage of said first output signal and switching circuit T₁, T₄ resp. T₅, T₈ operative to drive selectively said first CMOS in verter T₂, T₃ or said second CMOS inverter T₆, T₇ in response to a level of a control signal.
