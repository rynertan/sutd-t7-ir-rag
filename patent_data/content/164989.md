# Replacement of split pin assemblies in guide tubes.

## Abstract
Selected old split pin assemblies of the lower guide tube of a nuclear reactor are replaced by new split pin assemblies using a robotic work station under a pool of water. A plurality of remotely actuated robotic tools serve to position the guide tube precisely for a replacement operation, to fragment the old split pin assemblies and dispose of the fragments under water, and to install a new split pin assembly. The lower guide tube positioning means has a remotely operable hydraulic cylinder, for orienting the guide tube to be sequentially processed by different tools and also so that both split pin assemblies in each guide tube may be replaced by the same set of tools.
