# Control circuit for a D.C. motor for example in an electrically powered vehicle.

## Abstract
A control circuit for a direct current motor in which the armature 3 is arranged for reversible connection in a main path for current to flow from a first supply terminal 4 to a second supply terminal 7 through the armature 3 and a current chopper 6 . A pair of switches 1, 2 between which the armature 3 is connected are controllable to effect this reversible connection in the drive mode and to connect the armature 3 across a bridge D1, D2, D5, D6 to permit return current to flow from the second terminal 7 , in either direction through the armature 3 toward the chopper 6 in a regenerative mode, one or more diodes D3, D4, D7 D8, D9 being provided for completing a return path for the return current to flow to the first terminal 4 .
