# A semiconductor integrated circuit device with an improved heat sink.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device is disclosed with a multipack age structure in which a plurality, for example four, of IC packages 2 are mounted on a single mother board 6 . The mother board has multi layer interconnection circuits which connect the IC packages to appropriate pin terminals 7 . The invention lies in the heat sinks 1 , each of which is attached by brazing or epoxy resin to its respective IC package. Each heat sink 1 includes a highly conductive column 11 perpendicular to the mother board, and disk shaped heat dissipating fins 3 parallel to the mother board.
