# Sorbing apparatus.

## Abstract
The disclosure describes an apparatus for sorbing one or more components from a fluid. The apparatus comprises a housing having an inlet, an outlet, and an exhaust and defin ing a fluid flow path between the inlet, outlet, end exhaust partitioning structures which divide the housing into sorbing, regenerating, and cooling regions a hollow sorbent containing structure mounted for circulation within the hous ing in the fluid flow path and including sorbing, regenerating, and cooling sectors respectively defined by the sorbing, re generating, and cooling regions in the housing a mechanism for circulating the sorbent containing structure through the sorbing, regenerating, and cooling regions, respectively a heater disposed within the housing in the fluid flow path between the cooling and regenerating sectors of the sorbent containing structure first means for directing fluid from the inlet radially through the sorbing sector to the outlet and second means for directing a portion of the fluid radially through the cooling sector, past the heater, radially through the regenerating sector, and out the exhaust.
