# A heterojunction solid state laser.

## Abstract
A channelled substrate heterojunction semiconductor laser 2 in which transverse and longitudinal mode con trol is achieved by having the laser current profile flat over the substrate channel. A flat current profile over the sub strate channel, which is chieved by having the width of the path of the pump current greater than the width of the can nel, causes waveguiding to be influenced only by a fixed channel guiding factor.
