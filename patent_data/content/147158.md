# Lubricating oil compositions with improved low temperature pumpability containing ethylene alpha olefin polymers.

## Abstract
Ethylene alpha olefin copolymers are disclosed being particularly useful as improving the low temperature viscos ity and pumpability properties of lubricating oil comprised of a major and minor component each of which have a defined ethylene sequence distribution with respect to the number of ethylenes in sequences of three or more and the percent of ethylene sequences of three or more ethylene units. Ethylene propylene copolymers are the preferred embodi ment.
