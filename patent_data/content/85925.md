## Description
Burner with variable air controllerBurners are used for providing heat in various processes such as in the production and processing of liquid and gaseous petroleum products. These burners consume fuel gas, generally natural gas available at the site, as the source of heat energy. The amount of fuel consumed represents a reduction in the quantity available for sale and other uses. Ideally, a stoichiometric air fuel ratio maximizes fuel economy. From an emissions standpoint a small amount of excess oxygen is required to minimize unburned hydrocarbons. However, the typical burner with no variable air controller utilizes an excessive amount of air and excess oxygen which is inefficient and wasteful since unnecessary air is being heated than required for the desired heat transfer.The present invention provides the means of significantly reducing the fuel gas requirement in burners employed as a heat source in various processes in which a variable air controller is used for optimizing the air fuel ratio over the range of the heat output of the burner.The present invention is directed to a burner having a variable air source for optimizing the air fuel ratio in a burner having an air supply and a gas fuel supply. A valve having a variable sized opening is positioned in the air supply for varying the volume of air supplied to the burner. First means are connected to the valve for moving the valve in a direction for reducing the volume of air. A pressure responsive means is connected to the valve for moving the valve in a direction for increasing the volume of air. The pressure responsive means is connected to and is responsive to the pressure of the fuel supply thereby accurately varying the air supply in proportion to the amount of fuel used by the burner.Yet a further object of the present invention is the provision of a variable air controller for use on a burner in which the valve is adapted to be positioned in the air supply and includes an opening which increases in size from a first end to a second end.

Description of the Preferred EmbodimentsWhile the present invention may be used in connection with a burner in various types of processes, for purpcses of illustration, Figure 1 illustrates a system generally indicated by the reference numeral 10 for heating of some process fluid in oil and gas production equipment. The process fluid is contained, while being heated, in a vessel 12 through which the process fluid 11 flows. The heating is accomplished by heat transfer from a fire tube 14 in which the products of combustion of a fuel, either gas or liquid, generally natural gas, flow.Primary air and fuel gas are combined in a burner mixer 16 and discharged through the burner tip. This initial fuel air mixture is then combined with additional air and burned in the combustion zone 18 of the fire tube 14. The burner 16 is mounted within a burner housing 20 with the burner tip protruding into the fire tube 14. A pilot lighter 22 is positioned adjacent to the burner 16 for lighting the burner 16 when required.Air enters the burner housing 20 through a flash arrester 24. The differential pressure necessary to draw the air supply through the flash arrester 24 into the burner housing 20 plus the pressure necessary to overcome frictional losses in the fire tube 14 and stack 26 is provided by the combined effect of the stack draft and the momentum increase of the gases in the combustion zone 18. The products of combustion exit the system 10 through a stack 26.The temperature of the process fluid in the vessel 12 is maintained with a thermostat 28 which regulates the pressure of the fuel supplied to the burner through line 31. Generally, two types of thermostat motor valve actions may be used. One is a snap action wherein the burner fuel pressure from a supply 32 is the full regulated supply pressure or is zero. With this action a small increase in the fluid temperature of the process fluid 11 in the vessel 12 above the set point temperature is sensed by the thermostat 28 which results in the closure of the motor valve 30 turning off the fuel. Alternately, a small decrease in the temperature in the vessel 12 below the set point results in the full opening of the motor valve 30. A second type of thermostat motor valve action is termed throttling and results in a burner supply pressure which is continually regulated to hold the set.temperature. With this action, the burner supply pressure is held approximately constant unless the heat load of the system changes such as caused by a change in atmospheric conditions or a change in the flow rate of the process fluid in the vessel 12. In such a case, the thermostat 28 throttles the motor valve 30. This latter type of valve action is generally preferred since it is more efficient and saves energy.Generally, the system so far described in Figure 1, is conventional.Ideally, the system should be adjusted so that there is approximately five percent excess oxygen at the highest fuel pressure employed. However, the lower pressures or with the pilot only, the excess oxygen will increase as the burner supply decreases. In the past, most systems have not been adjusted to provide the ideal air fuel mixture but rather provide a fixed structure burner and burner orifice which produces a flame which looks good and sounds good and provides adequate heat. The typical results 35, as illustrated in Figure 2, provide excess oxygen at most supply pressures which far exceed the desired five percent excess oxygen optimum. The result in the typical burner is that excess fuel gas is burned in order to heat the excess air.The present invention is directed to providing an excess oxygen intake, as best seen in Figure 3 as graph 37, which varies from approximately three to five percent over the entire range of the burner fuel supply pressure which results in optimum fuel economy with minimum emissions. Another advantage is that the present system stabilizes the combustion which reduces burner flame outs. The present invention is directed to providing a variable air controller to provide a particular low level of excess oxygen over the range of the burner fuel supply pressures which results in a significant reduction, as great as fifty percent, in the required fuel gas flow rate as compared with the conventional fixed air flow structure systems presently in use.Referring now to Figure 1 and 4, the preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown which automatically adjusts and controls the supply of air flow to the burner housing 20 to achieve the desired excess oxygen characteristics 37 shown in Figure 3.The variable air controller of the present invention generally indicated by the reference numeral 40 is preferably positioned in the air supply such as being connected upstream of the flash arrester 24 and enclosing and controlling the supply of air for optimizing the air fuel ratio of the burner 16. The controller 40 is a valve having a housing 42 with a variable sized opening 44. Thus, the housing includes an inner wall 46 which increases in size from a first end 48 to a second end 50. The wall 46 is preferably tapered and thus forms a conical section opening 44.The valve 40 includes a valve element 52, such as a circular plate which is axially movable in the opening 44 for changing the area of the annular control orifice area A between the wall 46 and the outer edge 54 of the plate 52.Preferably, there is an air bypass in the valve, such as the area A0, at all times which provides a minimum amount of air flow through the valve 40 for satisfying the oxygen requirement of the pilot 22.The plate 52 is mounted on a movable rod 56 which is slideable through a wall of housing 58 and secured to a second wall 60. Suitable biasing means such as one or more springs 62 and 64 are provided between the walls 58 and 60 for yieldably urging the plate 52 in a direction for reducing the volume of air flow through the opening 44. Thus, the springs 60 and 62 urge the plate 52 towards the first end 48 of the tapered wall 46. Pressure response means, such as a diaphragm 66, is provided in the housing 58 and on the wall 60 and is thus connected to the valve element 52 for moving the valve element 52 in a direction for increasing the volume of air.The diaphragm 66 is exposed to a port 68 in the housing 58 which is connected by a line 70, as best seen in Figure 1, to the downstream side of the motor valve 30 and thus is connected to the pressure control supply of fuel gas supplied to the burner 16. Therefore, increased pressure of the fuel gas acts on the diaphragm 66 to move the valve 52 towards the second end 50 of the tapered wall 46 for increasing the annular area between the plate 52 and the wall 46 for increasing the volume of air. As the wall 46 is tapered, the area A of the valve opening is varied approximately linearly with the pressurized fuel gas.While the preferred embodiment shows a variable air controller responsive to the pressure of the fuel gas, liquid fuel could be utilized and the device would properly function. Also, other means could be used to open the air valve 52 such as an electrically driven servo or linear operated motor which is responsive to the electrical output of a thermostat 28 to move the air valve 52.The approximate area A between the outer edge 54 of the plate 52 and the wall of the opening 44 may be approximately defined as A Ao Cx P In the above equation A effective annular area between the air control plate and the tapered outer wall of the main housing Ao initial open area with plate not deflected x P burner gas pressure C a constantThis equation states that the annular area A is a linear function of burner pressure. Tests have shown that such an area pressure relationship will produce the desired air control, hence, give the proper excess oxygen pressure characteristic in a system as illustrated in Figure 1. Other types of systems may require a non linear control.The constant C may be varied, as required, by changing the number of control springs 62 and or 64 and or the spring rete stiffness of the control springs. The value of A is varied by 0 changing the air control plate 52 diameter, by changing the initial axial position of the air control plate 52, or by a variable bypass hole 72.The bypass hole 72 may be increased or decreased in size by the movement of an adjustable plate 74 which is pivotally connected to the plate 52 by pin 76. Adjustment of the plate 74 adds to the effective value of the area Ao. Adjustment of Ao has the greatest effect on the excess oxygen content at low or zero burner pressure. With zero burner fuel pressure, A represents the air control area for the pilot only.After installation of the variable air controller 40, the controller 40 can be calibrated and adjusted in order to provide the desirable excess oxygen limitations illustrated in the graph 37 in Figure 3. Thus, a sample probe, connected to an oxygen content instrument, could be inserted into the stack 26. With only the pilot 22 lighted, the area Ao could be adjusted by the adjustable plate 74 to give the desired excess oxygen reading. The burner fuel pressure would then gradully be increased from zero and the excess oxygen observed and measured over the normal burner fuel pressure range. If required, the number of springs 62 and 64 could be increased, decreased, or made stiffer or weaker as required to give the desired excess oxygen reading as the burner fuel supply pressure is varied.The present invention, therefore, is well adapted to carry out the objects and attain the ends and advantages mentioned as well as others inherent therein.While a presently preferred embodiment of the invention is given for the purpose of disclosure, numerous changes in the details of construction and arrangement of parts, will readily suggest themselves to those skilled in the art and which are encompassed within the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.
