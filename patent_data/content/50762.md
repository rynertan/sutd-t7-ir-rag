# Process for the preparation of vinylcyclopropane derivatives.

## Abstract
This invention provides a convenient and commercially adaptable process for the preparation of vinylcyclopropane derivatives in high yield. For the process an alkylating agent and activated methylene compound are reacted in the presence of an alkylene oxide derivative and alkali metal compound. Water can also be present and or the reaction may be carried out in an inert organic diluent.
