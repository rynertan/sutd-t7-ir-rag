# A mean square estimation circuit and a method of estimating the mean square of a succession of words.

## Abstract
Each word of a succession of N bit binary words have all their ones set to zero except for the most significant one. The number of zeros after the most significant one is doubled to produce a succession of 2N bit single element words which are accumulated. The accumulated value may be read and reset after a predetermined number of words to give the mean square estimate.

## Description
A MEAN SQUARE ESTIMATION CIRCUIT AND A METHOD OFESTIMATING THE MEAN SQUARE OF A SUCCESSION OF WORDSThe present invention relates to mean square estimation.A first aspect of the invention provides a mean square estimation circuit comprising means for supplying a succession of N bit binary words to a convertor. A second aspect of the invention provides a method of estimating the mean square of a succession of N bit binary words. Systems for calculating or estimating the mean of a succession of binary words are well known and an example is shown United States Patent 3807630 of Stewart. However many systems, for example digital signal processing systems, require the mean square of a succession of binary words to be determined. A system for estimating the mean of a succession of words raised to any power K is disclosed in British Patent 1601749 of Zorina. Here each binary word is quantised into eight levels. A value is stored for each level which is related to the power K. Each word is thereby reduced to a stored value and a succession of stored values are accumulated. In the present application for estimating a mean square K is equal to 2. A problem with this known system is that it is quite complex. Furthermore the choice of quantising levels is arbitrary, more levels giving greater accuracy and greater complexity. According to the aforesaid first aspect of the invention there is provided a mean square estimation circuit comprising means for supplying a succession of N bit binary words to a converter characterised by said convertor including means for setting all the ones of each binary word to zeros except for the most significant one to produce a succession of N bit single element words, and for then doubling the number of zeros after said most significant one of each N bit single element word to produce a succession of 2N bit single element words an accumulator arranged to sum said 2N bit single element words and means for reading the value stored in the accumulator which represents said estimate. The value stored in the accumulator may leak thus allowing the value stored therein to converge. However in a preferred embodiment the value stored in the accumulator is read after said accumulator has received a predetermined number of words whereafter said accumulator is reset. The converter may store each parallel N bit word and convert all the ones in said word to zeros except for the most significant one. However in a preferred embodiment the convertor includes a priority encoder which produces a code indicative of the position of the most significant one in each N bit word. According to the aforesaid second aspect of the invention there is provided a method of estimating the mean square of a succession of N bit binary words characterised by setting all the ones of each word to zero except for the most significant one to produce a succession of single element N bit words, doubling the number of zeros after the most significant one of each N bit single element word to produce a succession of 2N bit single element words, and accumulating the single element 2N bit words wherein the accumulated value represents an estimate of the mean square value of the N bit binary words. An advantage of the present invention is that it provides an efficient system for estimating mean squirt values. The system of the present invention does not require complex circuitry nor does it require extensive programming or processor time. Furthermore the technique may be implemented for any word length without extensive evaluation. The invention will be described by way of example only with reference to the drawing which shows a circuit for estimating the mean square value of digitally coded signals. A circuit for estimating the mean square value of a succession of digital words is shown in the Figure and consists of a decoder 2, a convertor 3, an accumulator 4 and a coder 5. The decoder 2 converts the digital signal to pure binary having N bit parallel words in this example N equals thirty two. The convertor 3 produces a 2N bit single element word by means of a priority encoder 31, a counter 32 and a NOR gate 33. The priority encoder 31 produces a five bit word which indicates the position of the most significant one in a thirty two bit word thereby effectively converting all the ones in said thirty two bit word to zeros except for the most significant one. A word in which only one bit is set to one is referred to herein as a single element word and said single element word may exist as the full word having thirty two bits or as a coded representation having five bits in this example. The five bit word is then supplied to the most significant bits of the counter 32 which has six bits.For each N bit word the counter 32 is decremented in response to 2N clock pulses and the count value is supplied to the NOR gate 33. The NOR gate 33 produces an output of one for an input of 000000 but produces an output of zero for all other inputs. Thus when the counter reaches zero a one is supplied to the accumulator. The accumulator 4 receives clock pulses at the same rate as the counter 32. The accumulator consists of a summation circuit 41, a store 42 and a sixty four bit shift register 43. The clock pulses are supplied to the shift register 43 which on receiving a clock pulse supplies the value stored at position 64 in the shift register to the summation circuit 41 where it is added to the output from the NOR gate 33 and then entered in position 1 of the shift register. After a word cycle, consisting of sixty four clock pulses, the output from theNOR gate will have been one for only one of said pulses and the shift register will have circulated so that the value originally at position 1 will be back at position one. After a predetermined number of word cycles in this example one thousand the value accumulated in the shift register 43 will be approximately equal to the mean square value of the digital signal. This value is then read by the coder 5 and the shift register 42 is reset. In an alternative embodiment the shift register is allowed to leak by multiplying the value stored therein by a factor during each cycle. In this way the shift register does not have to be reset and the mean square estimate is continuously available.
