# Fluorometer.

## Abstract
A sensitive frontal approach fluorometer, suitable for measuring the fluorescence of samples in open top microtest wells 20 , has an optical system 14 for a directing an exciting light downwardly into the well s open top fluores cently to excite the sample and b detecting the sample s emitted light which passes upwardly through the well s open top.
