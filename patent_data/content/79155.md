# Double walled self erecting container.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a double walled self erecting container which comprises an outer casing 1 of rectangular container cross section having first and second pairs of opposed side wall panels 3,5 and 4,6 , and respective end flaps 9, 13 11, 15 and 10, 14 12, 16 hinged to the side wall panels for inward folding to form closed ends of the container, and an inner liner 2 of flexible material contained within and adhering to portions of the inner surface of the outer casing 1 . The outer casing 1 is formed from a blank of foldable container forming material, and the first pair of opposed side wall panels 3,5 and the attached end flaps 9, 13 and 11, 15 have opposed longitudinally extending fold lines 18, 19 which enable the outer casing to be erected from a flat position in which the second pair of opposed side wall panels 4, 6 and the folded portions of the first pair of side wall panels 3, 5 are located in substantially the same plane to an erected container forming position of rectangular cross section. The inner liner 2 is of bag like form which, in the folded flat position of the container, comprises a pair of opposed side walls A , longitudinal side edges 20, 21 , a closed bottom edge 22 and an open top edge 17 . The inner liner 2 is adhered to the inner surface of the outer casing along lines of adhesion C in such a way that the longitudinal side edges 20, 21 of the liner extend alongside the fold lines 18, 19 in the first pair of side wall panels 3, 5 and the attached end flaps 9, 13 and 11, 15 . Further, to facilitate the closing of the bottom end of the container when in the erected position, corner portions B of the side walls A of the liner 2 adjacent to the junction between the closed bottom edge 22 and each side edge 20, 21 are adhered to triangular portions B min of the end flaps 13, 15 of the first pair of side wall panels 3, 5 which are adjacent to the closed bottom edge 22 of the liner 2 , the apex of each triangular portion B min being located at the end of a repective one of the fold lines 18, 19 .
