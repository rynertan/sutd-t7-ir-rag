## Description
This invention relates to 4 amino 4,5 dihydro 2 furancarboxylic acid, and 4 amino 4,5 dihydro 2 thiophenecarboxylic acids, the lower alkyl esters thereof and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, to their use as chemotherapeutic agents, and to the chemical processes and intermediates useful in the preparation thereof. More specifically, this invention relates to γ aminobutyric acid transaminase inhibitors useful in the treatment of epilepsy. These inhibitors are of the formula I including the individual enantiomers and racemic mixtures thereof, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein R is hydrogen or a C₁ C₆ lower alkyl radical, and X is oxygen or sulfur. US.A.398 3134 describes some 3 amino pyrrole or thiophene derivatives as intermediates for the preparation of wreylene thiophane compounds. The preparation of the compounds of this invention may be achieved by the judicial selection of the appropriate starting materials followed by the application of chemical reactions and techniques analogously known in the art. The compounds of the invention can be prepared according to the following procedure A compound of formula I wherein X is oxygen, in a racemic form, is prepared by a process which comprises One such process for preparing the In the process starting with L arabinose it is convenient to convert arabinose to a triol according to the method described for the D isomer by Rabinson and Fletcher, J.O.C. Following the bis mesylation, reaction of the 2 1,1 dimethylethyl dimethylsilyl oxy methyl tetrahydro 3,4 furandiol bis methylsulfonate with sodium azide will selectively displace the 4 position mesylate to form the desired azide. Following that step the 2 position primary alcohol is liberated by removal of the silyl protecting group and the resulting primary alcohol function is converted into the corresponding carboxylic acid function by oxidation, preferably by means of the Jones reagent a solution of chromic acid and sulfuric acid in water . The obtained product, 4 azido tetrahydro 3 methylsulfonyl oxy 2 furancarboxylate, is then submitted to esterification, preferably forming a methyl ester, although other esters may optionally be formed. Elimination of the remaining 3 position mesyl group by reaction with triethylamine at room temperature will form the desired 2,3 double bond and the resulting methyl 4 azido 4,5 dihydro 2 furancarboxylate is chemically reduced to the amine by reaction with triethylamine and propanethiol. Alternatively, the reduction of the azide may be effected with a hydrogen Lindlar catalyst using ethanol as a solvent. Following the reduction of the azide the ester is hydrolyzed by reaction with lithium hydroxide and methanol at room temperature. A process which yields only the racemic mixture of the desired compounds of this invention Formula I advantageously utilizes 2 furoic acid as the starting material. In the initial step the 2 furoic acid is subjected to chemical reduction to yield 2,5 dihydro 2 furoic acid by reaction with lithium and ammonia in absolute ethanol according to standard reductive conditions. The so obtained furoic acid is esterified and the resulting ester preferably the methyl ester , when subjected to silver isocyanate and iodine will yield, in situ,the desired methyl tetrahydro 3 iodo 4 isocyanato 2 furancarboxylate. The isocyanate function is converted to a carbamate derivative with an alcohol reactant, preferably utilizing a p methoxybenzyl alcohol reactant to protect the amine function. This reaction is followed by elimination of HI by stirring the iodo compound with diazobicyclooctane in acetone, to form the corresponding 4,5 dihydro compound. Following the formation of the desired double bond the ester is saponified and the resulting compound is subjected to acid hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid in anisole under an inert atmosphere argon to convert the carbamate to the free amine. Another process for preparing the 4 amino 4,5 dihydro 2 furancarboxylic acid compounds of this invention utilizes either the Starting with the γ methyl ester of the The hydroxy moiety of the so obtained methyl 4 1,1 dimethylethoxy carbonyl amino 5 hydroxy pentanoate is silylated by reaction with t butyldimethylsilyl chloride under strongly basic conditions using 4 dimethylaminopyridine and triethylamine at low temperatures, preferably at about 0 C. Utilizing freshly prepared lithium diisopropylamine under an inert atmosphere argon an enolate anion is formed on the carbon atom adjacent the CO₂CH₃ ester group and the so formed enol is subjected to silylation with trimethylsilyl chloride to form a ketene acetal. Concurrently therewith, the N atom is also silylated . The silyl ketene acetal is then subjected to a strong oxidizing agent, i.e., a mineral acid, preferably a per acid such as The α keto ester is hydrolized with aqueous perchloric acid or other equivalently functioning acids such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acids to remove the silyl group and, in the process of its removal ring cyclization occurs to form a hemi ketal, which ketal is dehydrated with thionyl chloride in the presence of pyridine to yield a methyl 4 1,1 dimethylethoxy carbonyl amino 4,5 dihydro 2 furancarboxylate. Although it is feasible to deprotect the amine function of the foregoing product s prior to hydrolysis of the ester group, it is preferred to convert the ester to its acid prior to deprotecting the amine and then, if desired, re esterify the acid compound. In effecting the hydrolysis it is preferred to utilize methanol in THF in the presence of aqueous lithium hydroxide, keeping the reaction mixture at ice bath temperatures. The removal of the t butoxycarbonyl protecting group is achieved by reacting the product of the previous step preferably the acid form with freshly prepared trifluoroacetic acid whilst under an inert atmosphere e.g., argon at ice bath temperatures, preferably between 0 and 10 C. An alternate method for the preparation of the α keto ester is to subject the silyl ketene acetal to oxygen in its The preparation of the desired compounds of formula I wherein X is sulfur i.e. 4 amino 4,5 dihydro 2 thiophene carboxylic acid derivatives is preferentially effected by a series of chemical reactions starting with derivatives of cysteine. In one such process, the amine moiety of 1 ethoxycarbonyl 2 mercapto ethaniminium chloride is converted to its t butoxycarbonyl derivative by reaction with di t butyl dicarbonate and the resulting product is treated with ethylbromoacetate, in situ, to form the desired N 1,1 dimethylethoxy carbonyl S 2 carboethoxyethyl cysteine ethyl ester derivative. Of course, other N protecting groups may similarly be employed. The so prepared cysteine ethyl ester derivative is then subjected to a cyclization reaction using Dieckmann reaction conditions, preferably employing lithium diisopropylamine although others may similarly be utilized. The resulting β ketoester i.e., ethyl 4 1,1 dimethylethoxy carbonyl amino tetrahydro 3 oxo 2 thiophene carboxylate is sequentially reduced and dehydrated, preferably utilizing sodium borohydride, followed by mesyl chloride and the resulting 4 N Alternatively, the t butoxycarbonyl protected cysteine starting material can be silylated by reaction with chlorotrimethylsilane and bis trimethylsilyl acetamide and the resulting product, when cyclized by reaction with freshly prepared lithium tetramethylpiperidine, will form a tetrahydro 2 thiophenecarboxylate bearing a silyl ether and alkyl ether at the 3 position thereof. The silyl ether is then removed by treatment with HF in the presence of tetrabutylammonium fluoride, and the product subjected to chemical reduction, preferably with sodium borohydride, to form the crude 3 hydroxy N t BOC protected tetrahydro 2 carboxylate ester. This product may then be subjected to the same dehydration deprotection reactions previously described to obtain the desired product.

The reaction mixture was poured into a separatory funnel containing 300 ml of ether, washed successively with 150 ml water, sufficient 0.5 N HCl to afford an acidic aqueous phase, and brine, and dried over MgSO₄. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure afforded 12.4 g of an oil which was purified by flash chromotography eluting successively with 7.5, 10, 20 EtOAc hexane to afford 7.53 g of product as a colorless oil. Into a stirring 25 C solution containing 7.53 g 18.5 mmole of the silyl ether of Step B and 93 ml of a 1M ethanolic HF solution prepared by mixing 1 part 48 aqueous HF with 29 parts of absolute ethanol was added 18.5 ml of a 1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride in THF. After stirring for 40 minutes the solution was cooled with an ice methanol bath and 520 mg 13.6 mmole of NaBH₄ was added portionwise at such a rate that the internal temperature did not rise above 0 C. Following the addition the reaction mixture was stirred for an additional 30 minutes at which point the remaining hydride reagent was destroyed by the addition of 10 ml of acetone. One ml of acetic acid was added after an additional 10 minutes and the reaction mixture was concentrated to a volume of 50 ml under reduced pressure. The concentrated mixture was poured into a separatory funnel containing 300 ml EtOAc and washed successively with 100 ml of 1 2 saturated brine, 2 x 30 ml water, and 50 ml brine, and dried over MgSO₄. Removal of the solvent at reduced pressure afforded 10.4 g of an oil which was used without purification. Into an ice cooled stirring solution containing the crude alcohol obtained in Step C, 75 ml of CH₂Cl₂, and 10.5 ml 74 mmole of Et₃N was added 2.9 ml 37 mmole of mesyl chloride while maintaining the system under a positive argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred an additional 5 minutes at 0 C and then 3 hours at 25 C. The reaction mixture was poured into a separatory funnel containing 200 ml Et₂O and successively washed with 70 ml water, 1N HCl until the aqueous wash tested acidic, 15 ml water and 50 ml brine, and dried over MgSO₄. Removal of the solvent at reduced pressure afforded 6.5 g of a brown oil which was purified by flash chromatography eluting with 15 and then 20 EtOAc hexane to yield 3.97 g of product. This material exhibited the following optical rotation at a concentration of 0.5 M in ethanol. The highest rotation observed for the To a stirring ice cooled solution containing 3.7 g 13.5 mmole of the ethyl ester in 45 ml of ethanol was added 19 ml of 1 N LiOH. After stirring for 1 hour the reaction mixture was extracted in a separatory funnel containing 100 ml EtOAc, 40 ml brine, 20 g ice, and 4 ml of 6N HCl, The organic phase was washed with 2 x 10 ml H₂O and dried over MgSO₄. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure afforded 3.2 g of a crystalline solid, 99 yield. This material was recrystallized from EtOAc hexane to afford 1.2 g of fluffy white crystals. The acid before recrystallization was 99.1 The recrystallized acid of step E 1.2 g was dissolved in 50 ml EtOAc, cooled with an ice bath, and dry HCl gas was bubbled through the solution for 3 minutes. Ten minutes later the cooling bath was removed. After an additional 1 1 2 hours the reaction mixture was filtered, and the solids washed successively with EtOAc and ether to afford 610 mg of the amino acid hydrochloride as an off white solid.
