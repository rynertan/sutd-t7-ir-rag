## Description
DESCRIPTIOX This invention relates to apparatus for diverting a load and particularly, but not especially, fcr apparatus for clearing a path through snow by diverting snow in a direction transversely of the path. It is knoll to provide snort ploughs in which a blade is provided at an angle so that snow is diverted transversely of the direction of motion of the plough through snow. While known snow ploughs are suitable for clearing snow in certain conditions, they are not entirely satisfactory lichen used for clearing a path along a road lined with hedges because, as the snow is diverted laterally of the plough during forward motion of the plough, the snow becomes compacted between the plough and an adjacent hedge or hedges causing a build up of snow and results eventually in a barrier of frozen compacted snow impeding further progress of the plough. According to the present invention, there is provided apparatus for diverting a load comprising guide means adapted to be directed towards the load for guiding the load laterally of a direction of motion towards the load, support means for the guide means, the guide means being movable relative to the support means with a component of velocity in a direction laterally of the said direction of motion, and drive means for moving the guide means relative to the support means so that, when the apparatus is directed in the said direction towards the load and the guide means is moved by the drive means, the load is swept in a lateral direction of the said direction. The guide means may be adapted to move perpendicular to said direction and said lateral direction. The guide means may comprise a pair of components adapted to form a wedge, each component being movable relative to said support means. Each said component may be pivotally connected to the support means. The guide means say co operate with a platform for receiving the load, the components being operable to sweep across a surface of the platform. The support means mat be adapted to be detachably secured to a vehicle. The drive means may be adapted to be controlled by operation of the ehicle. Following is a description, by way of example only and with reference to the accompaning dra√ßings,of one method of carrying the invention into effect. In the drawings FIGURE 1 is an elevation of an apparatus in accordance with the present invention. FIGURE 2 is a plan vie of the apparatus in an operating condition. FIGURE 3 is a plan view of the apparatus in another operating condition, and FIGURE 4 is a plan vie of the apparatus in a further condition of operation. Referring now to the drawings, there is shorn a snow plough 10 comprising 2 frame 11 adapted to be secured to the front of 2 vehicle, the frame comprising a pair of spaced parallel members 12, 15 connected b a transverse forward cross member 14 and a transverse rearward cross member 15 extending parallel to and rearwardly of the cross member 14.The forward cross member 1 4 has substanding from a central portion thereof a mast i6 on which is slideably mounted a housing 17, the housing being moved up ardly longitudinally of the mast 16 bp hydraulic pressure from a ram not shown , dow nvard movement of the housing 17 longitudinally of the mast 16 being under controlled reduction of pressure in the ram. The housing 17 has secured to a forward surface thereof an upstanding back plate 15 haring apertures 19, 20.The back plate IS has extending forwardly from a lower portion thereof z platform 21 and at opposite sides of a front surface thereof the back plate 15 has pivotally connec ted thereto a corresponding one of a pair of mov able plates 22, 23, the movable plate 22 being pivotally connected to the back plate IS, as shown at 24 and the movable plate 25 being pivotally connected to the back plate iS as shove at 25. A forward edge portion of the movable plate 22 is provi ded with a rearwardly extending slot 26 and a for ard edge portion of the movable plate 27 is provided with a rearwardly estending slot 27.The movable plate 22 is provided with a rearwardly estending knuckle bracket 28 and the movable plate 23 is provided with a rearwardly extending knuckle bracket 29. The housing 17 has located therein a pair of cylinders 30, 31 for operating a corresponding one of a pair of rans 52, 33. An end portion of the cylinder 30 remote from the ram 32 is pivotally connected to the housing 17, as shorn at 34 and an end portion of the cylinder 51 remote from the ram 33 is pivotally connected to the housing 17 as shown at 35.The ram 32 extends through the aperture 19 of the back plate 18 and is pivotally connected at an end portion thereof remote from the cylinder 50 to the bracket 2R of the movable plate 22 as shown at 36. The ram 35 extends through the aperture 20 in the back plate 18 and an end portion thereof remote from the cylinder 51 is pivotally connected to the bracket 29 of the movable plate 25 as shown at 57. Supply of hydraulic fluid is directed to the cylinders 30, 31 from a control valve 5 of a power take off pump on the vehicle which supplies a control valve 39 mounted on the housing 17. The control valve 59 is connected to the cylinders 90, 31 b way of a change over alve 40 which is arranged to supply hydraulic fluid alternately to the cylinders 30, v1. in use, the members 12, 13 of the frame il are secured to the front of a vehicle and the control valve 39 is connected to the power take off control valve 58 of the vehicle. The hydraulic cylinder not shown for raising the housing 17 relative to the mast 16 also is connected to the control valve 58 of the power take off apparatus. The control valve S is operated so that the rams 52, 55 locate the movable plates 22, 23 in the position sholm in Figure 2. The vehicle then is driven forwardly towards snow to be cleared and the snow is diverted laterally of the platform 21 by the plates 22, 23.When the depth of snow in a direction forwardly of the plough 10 is such that ground engaging wheels of the vehicle lose traction with the ground, the driver of the vehicle operates the control valve 5S of the power takeoff apparatus fo the vehicle so that the control valve 39 supplies hydraulic fluid to the cylinder 51 and actuates the ram 53 causing the movable plate 23 to pivot on the axis 25 in an outward direction of the platform 2i to the position shon in Figure 5. In consequence, snow is swept to the left of the platform by movement of the plate 23.The hZ draulic fluid forced out of the cylinder 51 as the ram 55 is urged outwardly of the cylinder is directed to the cylinder 50 causing the ram 32 to be dravm inwardly of the cylinder 50 whereby the movable plate 22 is pivoted on the axis 24 inwardly of the platform 21 to a position substantially parallel to the back plate 18, as shorn in Figure 3. When the ram 55 has extended to a limiting position out of the cylinder 31, the change over valve 40 is operated to reverse the flow of hydraulic fluid whereby the ram 32 is operated to moxe outwardly of the cylinder 50 and the ram 55 is dram inwardly of the cylinder 51. The result is that the movable plates 22, 23 pivot about their respective axes 24, 25 in a clock wise direction, when viewed in Figure 3, and snow which had collected on the platform 21 during forward motion of the ehicle is swept fron the platform by movement of the movable plate 22. en the ram 32 has extended to a limiting position out of the cylinder 50, the lovable plates 22, 23 are located in the positions shown in Figure 4. It will be appreciated, therefore, that as the vehicle continues to move forwardly, the movable plates 22, 25 are pivoted about their respective axes 24, 25 in s5 nchronism one vith another to sweep snow which collects on the platform 21 successively to the left and to the right of the forward path of movement of the vehicle. In this manner, less tractive effort is required by the vehicle to push the plough 10 into the snow because the plough 10 is continually shedding the snow instead of compacting the snow in advance of the vehicle to an extent where the vehicle ground wheels lose traction with the ground. If the snow drifts are encountered during forward motion of the vehicle, or a part of a road to be cleared is lined with hedges or banks, the control valve 35 from time to time is operated so as to arrest pivotal movement of the plates 22, 25 hen the plates are in either of the positions sholm in Figure 5 or Figure 4 and the vehicle is driven forwardly into the sno i until the ground wheels of the vehicle lose traction or until the platform 21 is covered with snow. The plough 10 then is raised on the mast 16 to a level above the side hedges or higher than the depth of snow, and the control valve 35 subsequently is operated with a result that the movable plates 22, 25 are again operated sequentially by the respective rams 32, 3r causing the snow located on the platform 21 to be swept over the hedges or the surface of the snow. The control valve 58 subsequently is operated to control lowering of the plough 10 on the mast 16 and the procedure is repeated. In this manner, the plough operates effectively as a digger with the advantage that snow which collects on the platform 21 is deposited without the necessit of turning the plough.
