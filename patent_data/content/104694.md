## Description
Method of manufacturing the housing of a spiral groove bearing The invention relates to a method of manufacturing the housing of a spiral groove bearing, in which the wall of a cylindrical bore in the housing is provided with a numbered helical grooves. Hydrodynamic spiral groove bearings comprising such a housing are described in, for example, GB PS 1,022,391 and GB PS 1,163,018. The grooves must be provided in the housing with great accuracy and this is a serious problem in the mass production of bearings of this kind. A known method described in GB PS 1,194,425 comprises the step of cutting the grooves with a cutting tool especially designed for this purpose, This method is not suitable for mass production. It has also been proposed to form the grooves by means of a photo chemical process, but this process also is not very suitable for mass production. A further manufacturing method is described inEP PS 0.002,292. In this me.Xiod, the bore in the housing is first rough turned, after which the grooves are rolled in the wall of the bore by means of a special tool and then the bore is finish turned in order to remove the proud.edges of the rolled grooves. This method is also rather time consuming and is comparatively expensive. The invention has for its object to provide a method by means of which housings of spiral groove bearings can be provided with grooves in a rapid, accurate and reproducible manner. The method according to the invention is characterized in that a shaft which is provided in a circumferential zone thereof with at least three pins which are distributed regularly around the circumference of the shaft and project radially outwards therefrom and whose free ends lie on a circle having a diameter which is larger than the diameter of the bore, is passed through the bore with a combined rotary and axial movement to form helical grooves in the wall of the bore, said wall being simultaneously machined so that the bore has the desired diameter between the grooves. In this manner, in a single processing step, a housing of a spiral groove bearing is obtained which need rot be subjected to further finishing treatments. In a favourable embodiment of the method, on at least one side of the zone in which the pins are located the shaft is constructed in a further circumferential zone as a broach having a maximum diameter which corresponds to the desired diameter of the bore between the grooves. In, this embodiment, the material forced up by the pins in forming the grooves is cut away by the broach so that the housing is finished in a single step. According to another favourable embodiment, in the zone in which the pins are located the shaft is given a diameter which is equal to or slightly larger than the initial diameter In this embodiment of the method, the housing is deformed more or less plastically, the material forced up by the pins being uniformly distributed over the entire wall of the bore and a smooth cylindrical bore with helical grooves being obtained. In order to be able to pass the shaft through the bore in an accurately centred position, on each side of the zone in which the pins are located the shaft may have a centering zone in which the diameter of the shaft corresponds to or is slightly smaller than that of the first mentioned zone. The invention will be described more fully with reference to the drawings. Fig. 1 and 2, show partly in section and partly in elevation two methods of providing helical grooves in a bearing housing. In Fig. 1, reference numeral 1 designates a shaft which is provided in a circumferential zone 2 with six pins 3 projecting radially outwards from the shaft and regularly distributed around the circumference thereof.On one side of the zone 2 is a circumferential zone 5 in which the shaft is constructed as a broach and is provided at its outer surface with a cutting edge 6. The shaft 1 can be mounted in a mounting device not shown further of a machine which can impart a combined rotary and axial movement to the shaft, By this movement the shaft is passed through the cylindrical bore 7 of a bearing housing 8. The bore 7 has a diameter which is smallerthan the diameter of a circle on which the face ends of the pins 3 are located. Consequently, the pins 3 will plough through the material of the housing and will thereby produce helical grooves with slightly proud edges in the wall of the bore 7. The pins are immediately followed by the broach 5, 6 which cuts away the proud edges so that after one pass of the shaft a completely finished bearing housing with helical grooves is obtained. Fig. 2 again shows a method of providing helical grooves in a bearing housing. A shaft 11 is provided in a circumferential zone 12 with a plurality of radially pro acting pins 13. The diameter of the shaft in the zone 12 is now equal to or slightly larger than the initial diameter of the cylindrical bore 17 of the bearing housing 18. Circumferential zones 14 and 15, which serve to guide the shaft 11 in the housing 18 and to centre it therein, are located on opposite sides of the zone 12. When the shaft is passed through the bore 17, the pins 13 will force helical grooves in the material of the bearing housing. However, proud edges cannot be formed now because the zone 12 fits closely in the bore 17 so that the formation of proud edges is prevented. The housing 18 is partly deformed plastically. When the zone 12 has passed through the bearing housing, helical grooves are left in the wall of the bore 17 and the diameter of the bore between the grooves corresponds to the desired value. Consequently, also in this manner, a spiral groove bearing housing is obtained in a single processing step.
