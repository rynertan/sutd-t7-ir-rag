# Ballast apparatus for operating a discharge lamp.

## Abstract
Starting and operating method and apparatus for dis charge lamps comprises a current limiting and rectifying means which provides at its output a low ripple current limited direct current. To effect lamp starting, a series connected inductor and capacitor form a high Q resonant circuit with the capacitor connected and across the lamp to be operated. This starting circuit connects through a blocking capacitor and charging resistor across the low ripple source of DC. A pair of transistors which comprise an oscillator are connected emitter to collector across the source of DC, with the common connector emitter and collector connected to the blocking capacitor. A drive air core transformer has separate feedback windings in the starting and operating circuits and drive windings are associated with the transis tors. A trigger diode is used to initially pulse one of the transistors which initially oscillate to generate square waves having a frequency corresponding to the resonant frequency of the starting circuit. After the lamp strikes, the transistors operate in a self oscillating mode with the operating frequen cy determined by the rate of current flow into the operating feedback winding.

## Description
STARTING AND OPERATING METHOD AND APPARATUS OR DISCHARGE LAN.PS This invention relates to starting and operating method and apparatus for discharge lamps and, more particularly, to such starting and operating method and apparatus which operate discharge lamps on square waves at a relatively low frequency wherein the apparatus currentlimiting components are included in circuit prior to the oscillator elements which form the operating square waves. Miniature high pressure metal vapor discharge lamps are described in U.S. Patent Specification No.4,161,672 Cap et al . Such lamps are known to have potential utility as screw in replacements for incan descent lamps. These lamps can also be operated with high efficacy at frequencies above the audible range. With such operation, there exist certain windows of permissible operating frequency as well as regions of instability for the arc and such a mode of high frequency operation is disclosed in U.S. Patent Specification No.4,170,746 Davenport . These lamps can also be operated from direct current. In the usual case, with DC operation or high frequency operation, it is normally required that the available AC be rectified and filtered with a relatively large capacity aluminum electrolytic. capacitor. Such filtering substantially reduces the power factor and aluminum electrolytic capacitors are sensitive to higher temperatures of operation and display a relatively short operating life, in some cases. It is known to operate discharge lamps with a rectified current wherein the current limiting impedance is placed into the line prior to rectification. Such a mode of operation is shown in U.S. Patent SpecificationNo. 3,787,751 Farrow . A variety of such arrangements are also shown in U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,084,217 Brandli et al. and U.S. Patent Specification No.4,187,449 Knoble . When high intensity discharge lamps are first started, they normally require a few minutes to warm up and generate operating pressure within the envelope in order to produce full light output. In addition, after momentary periods of power interruption, the lamps m cool down before they can be reignited, after which the pressure must again build up to achieve rated light output. It is well known to provide standby incandescent lighting for such lamps and a wide variety of circuits are available. One such standby lighting system is disclosed in U.S. Patent Specification No. 3,517,254 McNamara . Another type of such a standby lighting system is disclosed in U.S. Patent Specification No. 3,723,808 Jones .In U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,170,744 Hansler is disclosed a standby lighting system for use with a minia ture metal vapor lamp with the combination formed as a screw in light source. In the case of fluorescent lamps, it is known to operate such lamps with relatively low frequency square wave current in order to achieve an efficacy which is equivalent to that obtained with sine wave operation at higher frequencies. Such a mode of operation for fluorescent lamps is disclosed in Illuminating Engineering Vol. 54, January 1959, p. 69, discussion of article byCampbell. Accordingly the present invention resides in a ballast apparatus for operating discharge lamp means withAC energy having frequency in the acoustic range without generating in the ballast apparatus more than a very minor accompanying audible noise, characterized in that said apparatus comprises apparatus input terminal means adapted to be connected across the AC power mains and apparatus output terminal means across which said lamp means to be operated is adapted to be connected current limiting means comprising inductive reactance means and capacitive reactance means connecting to said apparatus input terminal means, and rectifier means having an input connected to said current limiting reactance means to generate a current limited low ripple DC potential at the output thereof and square wave oscillator means having an input connected to the output of said rectifier means and an output connected to said apparatus output terminal means, and said square wave oscillator means operable to generate at the output thereof square waves having a frequency in the acoustic range for operation of said discharge lamp means whereby the oscillator portion of said apparatus is separated from the current limiting portion thereof by said rectifier means. The invention also includes a method of operating a ballasted discharge lamp means with AC energy of a frequency in the acoustic range without generating more than a very minor accompanying audible noise in the ballast and the operating lamp means, generating current limited low ripple DC potential from commercial AC power by including current limiting reactance means between the AC power mains and a rectifier means to provide said currert limited low ripple DC potential at the output of said rectifier means energizing an oscillator means with said current limited low ripple DC potential output from said rectifier means to generate at the oscillator means output square waves of current which have a frequency in the acoustic range and energizing said discharge lamp means with said generated square wave current output from said oscillator means. In one embodiment of the invention, the apparatus has a lamp means starting circuit comprising series connected inductor means and capacitor means form a high Q resonant circuit, with the starting circuit capacitor means connected across the apparatus output terminals.The series connected inductor and capacitor in turn, are, connected via a charging resistor and a blocking capacitor across the output of the AC current limiting and rectifying means. A pair of transistors comprising oscillator means are connected emitter to collector in series arrangement across the output of the AC current limiting and rectifying means, with the common connected emitter and collector of the transistors connected to the blocking capacitor. A drive air core transformer means comprises a pair of feedback windings and a pair of driving windings which control the oscillations of the transistors. A first of the feedback windings connects in series with the starting circuit inductor and the capacitor and the second of the feedback windings and a current controlling resistor are connected in parallel with the starting circuit inductor and capacitor.A first of the driving windings connects between the emitter and base of one of the transistors and the second of the driving windings connects between the emitter and base of the other transistor. A trigger means is responsive to initial energization of.the apparatus to apply a turn on pulse to the base of one of the transistors to initiate oscillations therebetween to generate square waves. In the operation of the circuit, after initial energization of the apparatus and until the discharge lamp is started, the transistors alternately conduct to deliver square waves of current to the lamp at an oscillation frequency which is determined by the resonant frequency of the starting circuit series connected inductor and capacitor. After the lamp is started, the transistors alternately conduct to deliver square waves of current to the operating lamp at an oscillation frequency which is determined by the rate of current flow into the second feedback winding. In order that the invention can be more clearly understood, convenient embodiments thereof will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram of an apparatus for operating a miniature metal vapor lamp Fig. 2 is a partial showing of an apparatus similar to that of Fig. 1 wherein the lamp to be operated is a single fluorescent lamp Fig. 3 is a partial showing of an apparatus similar to that of Fig. 1 wherein the lamp means to be operated comprises to series connected fluorescent lamps and Fig. 4 is a partial showing of the apparatus ofFig. 1 wherein the lamp to be operated is a miniature metal vapor lamp and there is also provided a standby incandescent light source to provide illumination after periods of power interruption and during lamp warm up. Referring to Fig. 1, apparatus 10 for starting and operating discharge lamps has input terminals 12 adapted to be connected with a switch 13 across a source of AC potential of predetermined magnitude and there are provided output terminals 14 across which the discharge lamp 16 is adapted to be operatively connected. The apparatus comprises an AC currentvlimiting and rectifying means having an input connected t the apparatus input terminals 12 and operable to gener.e across the output 18 thereof a current limited low rippleDC potential. A similar rectifying device is shown inFig. 3 of U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,084,217 which is referenced in the background section. Briefly, the inductors L1 and L2 are included in separate branches of one side of the AC input line and a capacitor C1 connects in series with the inductor L2 to form a second phase with leading current. The diodes D1 D6 are connected to the outputs of the three circuit branches as a three phase full wave rectifier bridge, the output of which appears across terminals 18 as a low ripple DC.This DC output is current limited by the inductors L1 and L2 and capacitorC1. For the lamp types involved, such a rectifying device i6 particularly adapted for operation from power mains of 277 volt, 60 Hz, for U.S. applications and 220 volt, 50 Hz for European applications. It should be understood that a high reactance transformer could be substituted into this circuit to accommodate any of a variety of source voltages, in the manner as disclosed in U.S. Patent SpecificationNo. 4,187,449. It is desirable, but not necessary, to parallel the output terminals 18 with a small high frequency by pass capacitor C2 in order to ensure that none of the highfrequency components which are generated by the apparatus 10 are passed back into the power mains. The foregoing rectifying circuit thus provides a low ripple DC power output without the need for an aluminum electrolytic capacitor and, in addition, the DC is current limited.This is advantageous in that the operating frequency of the lamps preferably will fall within the acoustic range.Since the current limiting function occurs before the switching function, the current limiting components are not subjected to square wave currents at the lamp operating frequency which effectively eliminates any tendency of the ballasting components, such as laminations of a mag netit structure, to sing at the square wave excitation frequency. The power factor is typically about 94 . The particular lamp 16 which is intended to be operated in the circuit is a miniature metal vapor lamp having a rated power input of 35 watts. Such a lamp requires a relatively high voltage pulse to initiate the discharge or strike the lamp and to achieve starting thereof, there is provided a series connected inductor means L3 and capacitor means C4 which form a high Q resonant circuit with the capacitor C4 connected across the apparatus output terminals 14.The starting circuit series connected inductor L3 and capacitor C4 connect via a charging resistor R1 and blocking capacitor C3 across the output terminals 18 of the rectifying means 10. ben the apparatus is turned on, the voltage which is developed across C4 is essentially the voltage developed across the lamp during starting and it is established by the relative values of L3 and C4 and the current which is passed by the rectifying apparatus 10. During the starting operation,L3 and C4 have a representative Q of about 20 and in the case of a 35 watt metal vapor lamp, approximately 1500 volts is needed to start the lamp.This voltage is readily achieved by controlling the input current together with the series resonant circuit L3 C4. Then the apparatus is initially turned on, current flows through R1 to charge C3 to a voltage which approximates that developed across terminals 18. A pair of transistors Q1 Q2 comprise oscillator means and are connected, emitter to collector, in series arrangement across the output terminals 18 of the rectifying means 10, with the common connected emitter and collector of these transistors connected to the blocking capacitor means C3. A drive air core transformer means comprises a pair of feedback windings W1, W2 and a pair of driving windings W3, W5. The first of the feedback windings W1 connects in series with the starting circuit inducKor L3 and capacitor C4 and the second of the feedback windil W2 and a current controlling resistor means RZ connect ii parallel with the starting circuit inductor L3 and capacitor C4. The first of the driving windings W3 connects between the emitter and base of the transistor 22 and the second of the driving windings W5 connects between the emitter and base of the other transistor 21. To initiate the operation of the device after it is turned on, there is provided a trigger means comprising resistor R3, diode D7, capacitor C5 and trigger diode TR1.When the switch 13 is closed, C5 charges through R3 and when the trigger diode TR1 has a voltage of approximately 40 volts developed thereacross, it conducts and the C5 discharges into the base of Q2, turning Q2 on momentarily.This initiates oscillations between the transistors to generate square waves. Prior to the lamp 16 having a discharge initiated therein, current will flow through L3, C4 and the feedback winding W1 and as a result, the oscillator means comprising the transistors Q1 and Q2 will tend to oscillate at the resonant frequency which is established by L3 and C4. As indicated hereinbefore, because of the resonant nature of this circuit, this will apply a very high voltage across the apparatus output terminals 14. Once the discharge in the lamp 16 is initiated, the voltage across the apparatus output terminals will drop to somewhere in the range of 20 to 30 volts. This in turn causes the current through the feedback winding W1 to drop to a small fraction of its initial value, with a representative value of this current being 1 50 of its initial value. The oscillator frequency is then established by current flow into the feedback winding which is established by the value of resistor R2. The drive transformer is an air core transformer and the magnetizing inductance is quite low.The current which is flowing into W2 is initially transformed and flows out of the dotted terminal of Ws forming the base current for Q1 which turns Q1 on Eventually, the combination of rising magnetizing current and transformed load current equals the load current in W2 causing Q1 to begin to turn off.This reduces the voltage across R2 W2 with the result that the trapped magnetizing current flows into the dotted terminal of W3, which turns Q2 on. This self oscillating mode continues for the normal operation of the lamp, with a typical oscillating frequency being 1 kHz. An additional advantage of L3 C4 is to provide some filtering of the current into the lamp, during normal operation of the lamp, thereby reducing any tendency for RF radiation. Windings W4 and W6 and associated seriesconnected diodes D8 and Dg are connected between the base and collector of each of the transistors Q1 and Q2 and their function is to prevent transistor saturation during normal operation of the apparatus, in order to maintain the switching speeds thereof. A typical switching speed for the transistors utilized is in the microsecond range. In the case of miniature metal vapor lamps, they display severe reignition voltage requirements between cycles when operated with sine wave power at commercial frequencies. This can be avoided by going to very high frequencies, but this introduces the problem of arc tube instability. By operating these lamps with square wave power, the reignition problem is eliminated because the plasma conductivity renains essentially constant through the polarity reversals. The square wave power also provides for very smooth and acoustically quiet operation of the arc tube, permitting it to be operated with a single current amplitude selected for best efficacy.The frequency of polarity reversal can be varied over a wide range, including the acoustic range such as 16 Hz to 16 kHz, since there are no audible noise problems presented by the current limiting inductors which are isolated from the oscillator by the rectifier. Following is a component chart fot the circuit elements as shown in Fig. 1 which are designed for operating a miniature metal vapor lamp rated at 35 watts.

Such lamps are typically quite difficult to start on conventional rapid start ballasts and the foregoing circuit will start and operate such lamps very efficiently.In the partial circuit diagram as shown inFig. 2, a single fluorescent lamp 20 is connected across the apparatus output terminals 14 with the lamp electrodes 21 connected in series with the starting inductor L3a and capacitor C4a and winding W1. In the partial circuit diagram as shown in Fig. 3, two fluorescent lamps 20 are similarly connected in series across the output terminals 14 of the apparatus.In such an embodiment, the capacitor portion of the starting circuit preferably is split into two capacitors 2C4a As is conventional in the art, where miniature metal vapor lamps are used for general illumination purposes, it is desirable to provide some type of standby lighting so that general illumination is provided during lamp warm up and also immediately after momentary power failures when the metal vapor lamp has dropped out and will not start because of the residual pressures therein.The embodiment as shown in Fig. 4 comprises a circuit corresponding to that shown in Fig. 1, with most of the elements omitted in this showing, wherein an additional bi metal switch 22, which is normally closed when not heated, is placed in receptive proximity to the miniature metal vapor lamp 16. When the apparatus is initially energized by closing the switch 13, the bi metal switching member 22 is closed and the incandescent source 24 is energized. Once the miniature metal vapor lamp 16 is normally operating, the switch 22 opens, thereby deenergizing the incandescent source 24. When the switch 22 closes after a momentary power interruption, the standby incandescent source 24 is again energized to provide standby illumination. Many other types of standby energizing devices and circuitry can be substituted for the bi metal switch in the embodiment as shown in Fig. 4. For use with miniature metalvapor lamps, the apparatus of Fig. 1 could be incorporated as a part of a separate ceiling fixture wherein the miniatures metal vapor lamp and standby incandescent lamp could both b enclosed within the same diffusing globe. Alternatively, ,Such a fixture could be designed as a screw in or plug in incn descent lamp replacment wherein the miniature metal vapoi or metal halide lamp could be formed therewith as an integral unit or made replaceable. Likewise, the standby incandescent source, if used, could be made integral therewith or made replaceable. In actual tests conducted with miniature metalhalide lamps operated with square wave power, the reignition voltage spikes, as are encountered during operation with commercial sinewave power, were essentially eliminated. This is attributed to the very rapid rise time of the square waves and the lamp discharges are always in a conducting state, even during polarity reversal. The lamps were operated with square wave frequencies as low as 16 Hz and as high as 16 kHz and no noise was detected from the operating lamps. Also, noise from the ballast is eliminated. In some discharge lamp ballasts which utilize high reactance transformers, there is sometimes encountered a very minor noise due to the commercial AC energizing power. This can be eliminated by proper ballast construction, as is well known. In similar fashion the inductors L1 and L2 of the present apparatus may, in some cases, display a very minor but tolerable noise during lamp operation due to the commercial AC energizing power.Proper construction of the inductors will eliminate even this minor noise.
