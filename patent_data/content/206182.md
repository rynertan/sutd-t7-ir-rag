# Fluid filter with pleated filter medium.

## Abstract
An air filter element 10 consists of an annularly arranged pleated filter medium 16 having a plurality of radially extend ing pleats 18 . Two sides or legs of each pleat 18 are bonded to each other at the outer peripheral side to form an outer bonded section 24a while one sides or legs of the adjacent pleats 18A, 18B are bonded to each other at the inner pe ripheral side to form an inner bonded section 24b , thereby forming a fluid path extending between the adjacent pleats 18A, 18B along the length of each pleat. Additionally, outer 64 and inner 66 resilient seal members are so provided that a part of each outer bonded section 24a is embedded in the outer seal member 64 while a part of each inner bonded sec tion 24b is embedded in the inner sealing member 66 .
