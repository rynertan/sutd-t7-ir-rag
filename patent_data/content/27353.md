## Abstract
In a fruit machine, means sensing the positions in which symbol carriers R stop can accommodate rotation of the carrier in either direction. Associated with each carrier, two photo electric cells P1, P2 are each arranged to receive pulses of light from a light source through one of two series of apertures S in a disc D which rotates with the carrier R . The apertures are formed so that the cells P1, P2 generate two trains of electrical pulses of the same frequency but out of synchronism. The pulses are fed as an activating signal to a counter which changes its state in step with rotation of the carrier. Since the trains are out of synchronism, the signal is assymetrical in time so that rever sal of the rotation of the carrier causes a different signal to be sent to the counter. The two signals cause adjustment of the counter by an increment and a decrement, respectively.

## Description
GAMING AND AMUSEMENT MACHINES This invention is concerned with a gaming and amusement machine comprising a set of rotatable symbol carriers each of which is spun and stopped at random at one of a plurality of stop positions during each game to determine a symbol in a combination of symbols displayed to the player, and sensing means which senses the positions in which the carriers stop, the sensing means comprising pulse generating means associated with each carrier to generate electrical pulses as the carrier rotates to signal the movements of the carrier, and a counter associated with each pulse generating means to receive the pulses from the generating means so that the counter changes its state in step with rotation of the associated carrier and assumes a corresponding state for each of the stop positions of the carrier.The sensing means initiates a win signal for certain combinations of stop positions in which the set of carriers displays prize winning combinations of symbols. British Patent Specification No. 1 382 379 describes a gaming machine in which the position in which a carrier comes to rest is determined by counting, by electronic and photo electric means, the number of possible stopping positions traversed by the carrier when it was last in motion. The photo electric means generates a train of pulses which are fed to a counter which changes its state in a cyclic manner in step with rotation of the carrier, and so assumes a corresponding state for each of the possible stop positions of the carrier. The system as described is suitable only for unidirectional rotation of the carriers. It is an object of the present invention to provide a gaming and amusement machine comprising sensing means which can accommodate rotation of the symbol carriers in either of two opposite directions. According to the invention, the pulse generating means associated with each carrier is arranged so that a different signal is sent to its associated counter with rotation of its associated carrier in each of opposite directions, so that the counter assumes the corresponding state for each of the stop positions of the carrier in whichever direction the carrier is rotated. A suitable signal difference can be arrived at by employing pulse generating means which, with continuous rotation of the associated carrier, generates two trains of pulses which are of the same frequency but out of synchronism each pulse of one train can be paired with a pulse of the other train to form a signal which is assymetrical in time. The pulses of each pair may overlap in time, and may be of equal duration. The pulse generating means associated with each carrier may conveniently be of a photo electr c kind.In a preferred arrangement apertures are provided in a disc which rotates with the carrier, and a light source and photo electric means are arranged on opposite sides of the disc so that as the disc rotates light reaches the photo electric means, through the apertures, in pulses There now follows a description, to be read with reference to the accompanying drawings, of a gaming and amusement machine which illustrates the invention by way of example. In the accompanying drawings Figure 1 is a diagrammatic view showing an arrange ment of photo electric cells and disc slots of sensor means of the machine and Figure 2 illustrates one possible alternative arrangement for the disc slots. The machine, familiarly known as a fruit machine, comprises a set of rotatable symbol carriers, in the form of reels R, which bear on circumferential surfaces fruit symbols for display through a window to a player.The reels R can each be spun and stopped at random at one of twelve stop positions during each game, to determine one symbol in a combination of symbols displayed to the player by the reels. Certain combinations of symbols are prize winning combinations, and the machine comprises sensing means which senses the positions in which the reels stop and initiates a win signal for certain combinations of stop positions in which the set of reels displays prize winning combinations of symbols. The machine, as so far referred to, is of a well known kind of construction. The sensing means of the machine comprises pulse generating means associated with each reel R. Each pulse generating means comprises a disc D which has indexing slots in the form of circumferentially equispaced peripheral notches N, the disc being mounted co axially and fast with the reel R which carries the fruit symbols, the number of symbols being equal to the number of notches on the disc. The reel and disc are arranged to be rotated by mechanical means e.g. a motor and stopped by a relay operated latch L, which co operates with the notches N on the periphery of the disc. Associated with each reel R, the sensing means comprises three photo electric cells Pl, P2, P3 arranged on one side of the disc, and individual light sources not shown arranged on the opposite side of the disc D opposite the cells Pl, P2, P3. The disc D serves as a shielding member and apertures in the form of slots S are arranged in the disc to allow light to reach the photo electric cells Pl, P2, P3 in pulses as the disc rotates rotation of the disc thus causes the photoelectric cells to give outputs in the form of electrical pulses which signal the movements of the reel, the frequency of the pulses being dependent on the speed of rotation of the disc and the number of pulses being dependent on the angular movement of the disc.The pulses are fed to a micro processor control unit to interpret the pulse output, the control unit comprising an electronic counter, associated with each reel R, to receive the pulses so that the counter changes its state cyclically in step with rotation of the reel, and assumes a corresponding state for each of the stop positions of the reel. Figure 1 shows slots S in a preferred arrangement but Figure 2 shows a possible alternative arrangement, the slots in each case providingrtwo series of apertures allocated to photo electric cells P1 and P2.It may be convenient to have more than one slot allocated to photo electric cell P3. Figure 1 shows a disc which has twelve possible stopping positions, but other machines might have any suitable number of stopping positions. The pulses from P1 and P2 clock the electronic counter, and the number held in store in the counter corresponds to a stopping position of the disc. Pulses from P3 return the counter to zero, so, in the arrangement shown, and assuming constant and unidirectional rotation, the electronic counter would be clocked so as to count from 0 11 and then be restored to zero during each revolution of the disc. The arrangement of the cells P1 and P2 and the slots S is such that the pulse generating means generates, with continuous rotation of the reel R, two trains of pulses, through the cells P1 and P2, which are of the same frequency but out of synchronism. Each pulse of one train, induced by light passing through one slot S to one of the cells P1 and P2, is paired with a pulse of the other train, induced by light passing through the same slot S to the other of the cells P1 and P2, to form a signal which is assymetrical in time. With the forms of slot S shown in Figures 1 and 2, the pulses of each pair overlap in time, and are of equal duration. The outputs from the photo electric cells are High 1 when not receiving light, so that the pulses from P1 and P2 follow the pattern in the table below for one twelfth of a revolution of the disc in a clockwise direction as seen in Figure 1 EMI5.1 tb SEP STARTING SEP 300 tb CELL SEP POSITION SEP ROTATION tb SEP Stopping tb SEP Position tb P1 SEP 1 SEP 001 SEP 1 tb P2 SEP 1 SEP 100 SEP 1 tb The counter of the micro processor, arranged to store the reel position, is arranged to be adjusted by an increment each time the signal 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 is received. The counter is of course returned to the zero state whenever a pulse is received from P3. It will be observed that when the disc is rotated counter clockwise, the signal formed by the two trains of pulses is 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1, and this is arranged to adjust the counter by a decrement.It is thus arranged that a different signal is sent to the counter with rotation of the reel R in each of the opposite directions, so that the counter assumes the corresponding state for each of the stop positions of the reel in whichever direction the reel is rotated. If required the sensing means could be arranged to monitor the state of the counter more frequently than once per revolution. For that purpose four slots could be positioned in the disc D, for co operation with the photo electric cell P3, the slots being arranged at positions in which the coincidence of PI, P2, P3 is respectively 1 1 1, 1 1 0, 1 0 0 and 1 0 1.
