# Flavourant composition for tobacco, method for its production and tobacco product containing said composition.

## Abstract
A flavourant composition for tobacco may be produced by heating certain synthetic inorganic ion exchangers contain ing zirconium or titanium together with a tobacco flavourant in an organic solvent to adsorb the flavourant on the exchanger. Said flavourant compositions may be used advantageously in filter cigarettes, for example by adding them to the filter tip in the form of a triple filter or dual filter. The flavourant in flavour ant compositions of the invention added to filter tips scarcely volatilizes on standing but is released readily from the compo sition by wet smoke passing through the filter tip when the ci garette is smoked, whereby the aroma and taste of the flavour ant may effectively be produced. The amount of tobacco flavour ant capable of producing proper or moderate aroma and taste is far less than that of flavourants that have customarily been added to blended cut tobacco. The ion exchangers in the compositions of the invention do not affect the essential aroma and taste of the tobacco flavourants.
