# CONTROL MEANS FOR A TUMBLE DRYER

## Abstract
In a control means for a tumble dryer, wherein the temperature of air preheated by the drum is sensed up stream the heating means 6 and the temperature of the air discharged from the tumble dryer is sensed, the heating means 6 is de energized when a first, presettable difference of these temperatures is reached, and the drum motor 4 and fan motor 5 is de energized when a second, presettable difference of these temperatures is reached, the means for sensing the temperature differences is a mechanical measur ing and actuating means 2 operating on a change over switch 1 the bistable switch 1 is coupled with a switching means 3 for sequentialiy switching the heating means 6 and the drum motor 4 and fan motor 5 . The control means is mechanically simple and robust and constructed so as to be extensively free of servicing.
