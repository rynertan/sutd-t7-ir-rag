## Description
Improvements in or Relating to Ignitron Devices This invention relates to ignitron devices, that is to say a discharge device comprising, within a sealed chamber, a pool of liquid metal usually mercury connected to a cathode terminal and an anode electrode provided above the surface of said liquid metal. Unlike a mercury arc rectifier which is normally operated with high levels of current, an ignitron device is normally required to operate with relatively low levels of current. Frequently such devices are used in so called crow bar operations in which case, following high current crow bar discharges, the power supply follow through current can last up to 50ms and is usually at a level of several amps. At low currents e.g. below 10A for long durations e.g. above 5ms the mercury discharge arc in the ignitron device becomes unstable and moves in a random manner across the surface of the liquid metal pool. It is believed that collisions between this unstable arc and the envelope wall of the ignitron occur and cause a metallic arc to occur on the metal surface contaminating the ignitron and de ageing of the device. De ageing results in a reduction in hold off voltage.It is also believed that stray magnetic non axial fields from nearby power devices transformers etc. may aggravate this problem. The present invention seeks to provide an improved ignitron device in which the above difficulty is reduced. According to this invention an ignitron device includes means for magnetically constraining the discharge arc of the device towards the centre of the liquid metal pool and away from the envelope walls thereof. Preferably said magnetic means comprises a permanent annular magnet at least partly surrounding the region between the anode of said ignitron device and the surface of said liquid metal pool, said magnet being effective to create an axial magnetic field in the region between said anode and the surface of said liquid metal pool. The invention is illustrated in and further described with reference to Figures 1 and 2 the accompanying drawing of which Figure 1 is a section through one ignitron device in accordance with the present invention and Figure 2 is a circuit diagram of a typical power supply circuit using an ignitron device in accordance with the present invention in a crow bar role. Referring to Figure 1, the device consists of an evacuated envelope 1 in the base of which is a mercury pool 2. An anode 3, with a conically shaped end, is arranged coaxially above the mercury pool 2. As so far described the arrangement is conventional. For the sake of clarity features such as water jackets, if water cooled, cathode connection to the mercury pool 2, ignitor electrode and ignitor connection, and so forth are omitted. For a more detailed description of the conventional features of an ignitron device reference may be made to the literature, for example to page 7 81 of the Electronics Engineers Reference Book , Fourth Edition, published by the Butterworth Group. In accordance with the invention, an annular permanent magnet 4 surrounds, in this case completely, the space between the anode 3 and the surface of the mercury pool 2. As will be seen the permanent magnet 4, in axial length, overlaps both the mercury pool 2 and the anode 3. Within the space between the anode 3 and the surface of the mercury pool 2 an axial magnetic field is induced, as represented by the dashed lines 5, which act to constrain the mercury discharge arc towards the axis of the device and away from the walls of the envelope 1 thus preventing collisions between the arc and the envelope wall at times when the arc is unstable. Whether or not this explanation is correct it has been found that an ignitron device in accordance with the present invention tends to have a more predictable behaviour than a corresponding device without the aforementioned magnetic means. Because the mercury discharge arc tends to be more controlled, it may also be found that the low current performance is enhanced and reliability and life span improved. Referring to Figure 2, the circuit illustrated comprises a power supply 6 connected to supply load terminals 7. In the negative line from the power supply 6 to the load terminal 7 are connected two resistors 8,9 in the series. An ignitron device 10 as described with reference to Figure 1 is connected to operate in a crow bar role across the output terminals of the power supply 6. The cathode electrode 11 of the device 10 is connected to a point between the resistors 8 and 9 whilst the anode is connected to the positive output line, which is grounded.
