## Abstract
An oven which is suitable for use in baking bread and which incorporates a baking chamber 12 through which an endless conveyor 18 is driven for transporting product support trays 36 into, through and from the chamber. The conveyor 18 enters the lower region of the chamber 12 , exits from an upper region of the chamber and makes a plurality of horizontal passes 30 to 34 in ascending through the chamber. A bank of controller regulated heating ele ments 40 to 42 is located between each of the horizontal passes of the conveyor but tunnels 48 and 51 are provided in the lower region of the chamber 12 to prevent heat from being radiated downwardly onto the product support trays 36 during their initial stage of conveyance through the chamber.
