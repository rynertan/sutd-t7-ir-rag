# A method and installation for fitting nuts to a workpiece.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method and to an installation for fitting nuts to a sheet metal workpiece, by punching the nuts thereinto. In order to provide a rational and flexible nut punching system which can be readily adapted to serve mutually different workpieces, it is proposed in accordance with the invention that the workpiece is securely positioned in a fixture 14 that a portable nut punching tool 19 is fitted to a tool attachment provided on the wrist of an industrial robot 12 that the robot 12 positions the nut punching tool 19 sequentially in pre determined locations on the work piece to which nuts are to be fitted and that the nut punching tool 19 is activated in such locations so as to punch nuts securely into the sheet metal workpiece.
