## Description
Absorbent Non delignified Wood PulpBackground of the InventionThis invention relates to absorbent products incorporating therein, as a part of the absorbent body of such products, non delignified wood pulp and more particularly thermomechanical wood pulp.The use of non delignified wood pulp such as thenmomechni cal wood pulp, has already been suggested in products for absorbing body fluids. Several factors make such a material attractive. Firstly, the processes used for converting the raw materials i.e. trees, branches, and the like, into non delignified wood pulp are substantially more efficient than those for producing delignified wood pulp e.g., chemical wood pulp. It is estimated that in some thermomechanical wood pulp processes up to 90 by weight of the starting material is recovered as pulp as contrasted with recoveries of the order of about 50 for chemical pulping processes.Further, the nonchemical thermomechanical wood pulp processes do not suffer from the problem of creating air and water pollutants or effluents containing such pollutants as is the case of chemical wood pulping processes. This nonpolluting characteristic coupled with the aforementioned increased efficiency, results in a relatively inexpensive form of wood pulp. The low cost then is a major reason for prior suggestions that non delignified wood pulp be incorporated in such disposable body fluid absorbing products os sanitary napkins, diapers, tampons, wound dressings, and the like.From a functional view, it has been noted in the art that non delignified wood pulp fibers are stiffer than chenical wood pulp and thus have less tendency to collapse and expel absorbed fluid.The foregoing advantageous features of non delignified wood pulp notwithstanding, such wood pulp has not yet been employed to any substantial degree in conmercial products for absorbing body fluids. The major reason for this is the unfortunate characteristic of such fibers in that the presence of high quantities of lignin surrounding the cellulose fibers render the product substantially hydrophobic as compared to chemical wood pulp. Accordingly, liquid striking the surface of a pad of non delignified wood pulp tends to either run off or only slowly be absorbed into the body of the pad. The poor wetting characteristics of such wood pulp prevents good capillary liquid transfer within the pad and hence, poor distribution of any of the liquid absorbed.Accordingly, there is a need for providing non delisniziec pulp for an absorbent product which not only retains the low cost and good wet collapse resistance of nondelignified pulp but also has improved hydrophilicity.Summarv of the InventionIn accordance with the teachings of this invention, highly absorbent, rapid wicking, non delignified wood pulp is provided for use in the absorbent body of a product for absorbing body fluids. Such wood pulp is characterized bv being exposed to a corona discharge treatment wherein an electric arc is created between charged plates, said arc then ionizing the surrounding gaseous nediun. By passing the non delignified wood pulp through this ionized gaseous medium, the corona, it has been discovered that a substantial increase in the rate of absorption occurs. Preferably thermonechanical wood pulp is employed as the non delignified wood pulp and, in the simplest fort of this invention, the wood pulp is in board form.It is preferred that the wood pulp surface be a corona induced by an energy input of at least about 10 kilojoules per square foot of board kj ft2 and preferably at least about 50 kj ft2. Diminishing improve ment is noted when the treatment exceeds 250 kj ft2. The so treated wood pulp may be incorporated into such body fluid absorbent products as sanitary napkins, tampons, diapers, wound dressings and the like. When the wood pulp is treated in board form it may be used directly in this form or, alternatively, may be ground into wod pulp fluff. Further, the treated material may be combined with other absorbents such as for example, the sQ calledg superabsorbents e.g., hydrocolloidal materials, generally polymers, capable of swelling in aqueous solutions and hence, capable of retaining more than 10 times their own weight of said aqueous solutions.This conbination of the treated non delignified wood pulp and the superaborent materials is particularly efficacious in that the rapid wicking property of the treated wood pulp complenents the high fluid retention property of the superabsorbents thus promoting rapid fluid uptake with high retentivity and full use of the superabsorbent properties.Detailed Description of the InventionThe invention comprises providing an absorbent body co prising non delignified wood pulp that has been treated the ionized air environment of a corona discharge unit. the non delignified wood pulp starting material is generally in the form of thermomechanical wood pulp although other forms of nonchenical wood pulp may be employed e.g. refiner pulp or mechanical wood pulp. The thermomechanical pulping processes have been known for some time and are usually carried out under pressure, using one, two, or more stages of disc refining. Generaliy said processes employ any of the various soft woods, such as spruce, balsam, western hemlock, douglas fir, white fir and the various pines, especially southern pine such as loblolly and slash pines.The wood is initially cut into chips and then undergoes steaning in one or more presteaming stages to soften the middle lanella and allow the wood to be more easily worked and defibrated during the disc refining. The presteamed chips are then pressure refined at steam temperatures of over 250 F, in one or more stages, to produce the thermal mechanical wood pulp which is generally formed into pulp board. Frequent ly, such thermomechanical pulp is combined with conven tional chemical pulp prior to the board forming operation. In accordance with the teachings of this invention, the non delignified wood pulp is subjected to an ionized air environment, preferably generated by corona discharge treatment. It is believed that the operative factor in thet improvement in absorption performance achieved through the teachings of this invention is the contacting of the surface of the wood pulp with a sufficient concentration of ionized air and, in particular, oxygen ions, for a sufficient time. When using a corona discharge treatment, the intensity of treatment may be measured by the applied area r unit area per unit time of wood pulp surface being treated or more simply, the applied energy per unit area of, surface being treated. This parameter may be expressed, for example, in units of kilojoules per square fo6t. Kj flê . It should be understood that in using this enpirical method of designating the intensity of treatment, the surface area of the wood pulp is defined as the area of a plane passing through the uppernost layer of the wood pulp fibers and not the actual surface area of the fibers themselves. It should also be noted that any other degree of treatment which subjects the wood pulp to substantially the same concentration of ionized oxygen for substantially the same residence time is believed to be an equivalent of the energy per unit area parameters set out herein with respect to corona discharge treatment.It has been discovered that by treating non delignified wood pulp in the corona of a corona discharge to the degree represented by an energy input per unit area of at last about 10 kj ft2 significant improvement is realized in the rate of absorption. Preferably, even more improvement is realized when the energy input is at last about 50 kj ft2. It has also been found that, beyond an energy input of about 250 kj ft2, little further improvement is noted.The invention and the advantages which follows will be better understood by consideration of the following examples. SAMPLE PREPARATIOM Sample 1A pulp board sheet consisting of 100 thermomechanical wood pulp, obtained fron the Eastex Company of Silsbee,Texas is subjected to a corona discharge treatment. The sheet has a basis weight of 1.28 oz ft2, a width of 8 inches, and a thickness of 0.073 inches. The sheet is introduced, at the rate of one foot per minute into aLepel High Corona Treatment Unit, said unit being obtained from the Lepel High Frequency Laboratory, Inc. of Maspeth,N.Y. and sold by them as Model ST 2, Type 19110185.Generally, the equipment comprises rollers for feeding the board into the unit, adjustable positive bar electrodes above the sample and a hard conductive rubber drive roller below the sample which acts as the negative electrode.The gap between electrodes may be adjusted by lowering or raising the positive electrode. Means are provided for carrying away the ozone generated by the unit. The sample is treated at a D.C. voltage of 16R a D.C. anperage of 1.2 to 2 amp., with the gap set at 3 16 inches. Several samples of the Eastex Tln board are treated at various energy input levels of from 0 to about 475 kj ft2.Sample 2A pulp board sheet consisting of 50 thermomechanical wood pulp and 50 bleached chemical wood pulp, obtained from the Weyerhauser Company of Settle, Washington, is subjected to a corona discharge treatment. The sheet has a basis weight of 1.98 oz ft2 a width of 5.5 inches, and a thickness of 0.044 inches. The sheet is introduced into the above described Lepel High Corona Treatment Unit, again at a rate of one foot per minute. The sample is treated at a D.C. voltage of 169f a D.C. average of 3.8 a P, with a gap set at 3 16 inches. Several samples of the 5050 board are treated at various energy input levels of from 0 to 950 kj ft2.Sample 3 Comparative As a comparative sample, a pulp board sheet consisting wholly of chemical wood pulp and specifically, 100 bleached kraft wood pulp obtained from the ITT RayonierCompany of Stanford, Cornecticut, is subjected to a corona discharge treatment. The sheet has a basis weight o 2.24 oz ft2, a width of 5.5 inches, and a thickness of 0.051 inches. The sheet is introduced into the Lepel HighCorona Treatment Unit at a rate of one foot per minute and is treated at a D.C. voltage of 16sty, a D.C. anperage of 1.2 2, app, with a gap set at 3 16 inches. Several samples of this wholly chemical wood pulp board are treated at various energy input levels of from 0 to about 950 kj ft2.Example 1The sample 1 series of pulp board sheets consisting of corona treated 100 thermomechanical wood pulp are tested for their relative absorption rates utilizing the 7 ccAbsorption Test. In accordance with this testing procedure, the sample is placed on an absorbent substrate such as a chemical wood pulp pad. A half inch thickPlexiglas plate having an eliptical orifice therethrough is placed upon the sample to be tested. The eliptical orifice has a major axis of 1 1 2 inches and a minor axis of 3 4 inches. An aqueous solution having a salt content of 1.0 percent sodium chloride, by weight, is poured into the orifice while keeping the orifice filled until a total of 7 ccs of liquid has been applied.Using a stopwatch, the time from the initial contact of liquid with the sample to when the last of the fluid is absorbed from the orifice is measured and recorded as the absorption time.Each sample tested measured 5 centimeters by 22.5 centimeters. Table 1 below reports the absorption tine as a function the intensity of the corona discharge treatment expressed as kj ft2.

In accordance with this test, a strip of board measuring 1.5 by 10 centimeters is placed on a plate forming an angle of 15 with the horizontal. The plate rests on a horizontal plate having an orifice therein, the orifice being in flow communication with a reservoir of aqueous solution having a salt concentration of 1.0 sodium chloride, by weight.The solution level is maintained level with the surface of the plate. The edge of the sample nearest the plate is adjusted to touch the surface of the fluid in the orifice.The time required for the fluid to wick upward through the board is measured for each centimeter that the fluid front traverses. The results of this test are reported below as the average wicking rate in centimeters per minute as a function of the intensity of corona discharge treatment.

In accordance with this test, a cylindrical wire basket is filled with a 5 gram sample of disintegrated test material, i.e., pulp board which hac been fluffed in a Waring blender. The basket is held above a reservoir of water with the axis of the basket parallel to the surface of the water. The basket is dropped into the water, and the time required for the basket to be fully submerged is reported as the basket sink time. Samples are tested immediately after corona discharge treatment and then after 1 week, 3 weeks, and 5 weeks after such treatment. The results are reported below in Table 3 as a function of the intensity of treatment. Table 3 Absorbency Rate by Basket Sink Test Effect of Aging Basket Sink Time Sec.

This relationship holds true even after aging for periods of 1 5 weeks indicating a permanent improvement in the absorbency rate by virtue of the corona discharge treatment. Sample 2, comprising 50 thermomechanical wood pulp and 50 chemical wood pulp, will exhibit better absorbency rates by virtue of the presence of the hydrophilic chemical wood pulp. Nevertheless, substantial improvement is seen in the absorbency rate both initially and after being aged by increasing the intensity of treatment. It should be noted that this improvement diminishes at the higher intensity rates.Sample 3, the comparative sample comprising of 100 chemical wood pulp, likewise shows an improvement in absorption rate immediately after treatment. It is noted, however, that after a period of 1 to 5 weeks, this initial improvement has disappeared and there is no difference in absorption rate irrespective of the degree of treatment.
