# Electrostatic copying apparatus.

## Abstract
An electrostatic copying apparatus wherein a stationary original document image is projected onto a photosensitive member 2 during movement of an optical device 238 for exposing, and an electrostic latent image formed on the photosensitive member is transferred onto a copy sheet and is fixed, comprising a a jam detecting means for immediately detecting a copy sheet being jammed on a transport path and b a cleaning device 13, 330, 332 for removing residual toner particles remaining on the photosensitive member by means of magnetic force and for storing the removed toner particles after transferring operation. According to this invention, an occurrence of jam is detected immediately, and thus a falt or an accident of the electrostatic copying apparatus due to jam is prevented from expanding.
