# Liquid transport device, method of transporting a liquid, method of analyzing a liquid and test element for use in analysis of a liquid.

## Abstract
A liquid spreading device and a method of spreading a liquid by means of this spreading device. The spreading device 10 includes opposed surfaces 16, 18 providing a capillary flow zone. Each surface 14, 16 includes means 42, 44 for directing flow along predetermined paths and at least one surface 16 includes means 26 to permit liquid introduc tion between the surfaces 16, 18. At least a portion of the paths of one surface form a positive angle Î± with respect to the paths of the directly opposing portion of the other surface, whereby controlled multidirectional flow of liquid introduced between the surfaces occurs with a predetermined peripheral configuration. Also disclosed are methods of analyzing a liquid and test elements for them which include the spreading device and the method of spreading the liquid.
