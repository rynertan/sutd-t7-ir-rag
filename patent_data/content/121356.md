# Energy efficient process for the stripping of gases from liquids.

## Abstract
In a process for the recovery and reuse of the heat con tained in the gas vapor overhead mixture from a stripping column 1 in which a noncondensable gas is stripped from a liquid solution by contacting the solution with a hot vapor such as steam, the steam or other vapor in the overhead mixture is separated from the noncondensable gas or gases by preferentially passing the vapor through a semipermeable membrane 2 . The water or other condensable vapor is then compressed and either reinjected at the bottom of the strip ping column 2 or condensed in the column reboiler 4 , thus permitting its reuse in the stripping process. If the compres sed vapor is reinjected into the stripping column, it serves as the stripping medium itself. If the compressed vapor is con densed in the column reboiler 4 , its latent heat of vaporiza tion is thereby recovered and used to generate the required stripping vapor by boiling the solution being stripped.
