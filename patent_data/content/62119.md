## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING 1,3 DITHIOL 2 YLIDENE MASONIC ACID DIALLYL ESTERS This invention relates a process for producing l,3 dithiol 2 ylidene malonic acid dialkyl esters.They are known compounds useful as agricultural or horticultural fungicide and also as therapeutic agents for treating hepatic diseases. Referring to the process for synthesizing the 1,3 dithiol 2 ylidene malonic acid dialkyl esters by use of malonic ester derivatives as one of the starting materials, for example, the following processes have been disclosed 1 Dehydration of corresponding 4 hydroxy i,3 dithiolan 2 ylidene malonic esters Japanese PatentApplication Laid open No. 48667 1976 EMI1.1 In this equation, R and R are the same or different and each represents lower alkyl. The same definitions apply hereinafter. 2 Reaction of corresponding dialkyloxycarbonylketone dimercaptides with a cis 1,2 dihalogenoethylene in an aprotic polar solvent Japanese Patent ApplicationLaid open No. 63085 1979 . EMI2.1 In this equation, M and X represent alkali metal and halogen, respectively. In process 1 , the starting compounds 4 hydroxy 1,3 dithiolan derivatives are required to synthesize, from substituted ketene mercoptides represented by formula II , which are the starting materials of process 2 . Therefore, process 1 has the disadvantage that the overall manufacturing process is longer as compared with process 2 . Meanwhile, any l,2 cis dihalogenoethylene used in process 2 is at present not commercially available as an industrial raw material. Hence, it must be specially manufactured and then would be expensive. Moreover, this compound is difficult to obtain in a purified form and involves the problem of isomerization. Thus, both the prior arts admit of improvements in technical and economical aspects. Recently, the present inventors have found that dialkyloxycarbonylketene dimercaptides, which can be obtained by the reaction of dialkyl malonates with carbon disulfide, react with a l,l dihalogenoethylene to accomplish ring closure, thus giving l,3 dithiol 2ylidene malonates. This reaction can be schematically represented as follows EMI3.1 In this equation, M is alkali metal or ammonium, and X, R, and R are as defined above. Dialkyloxy carbonyketene dimercaptides represented by formula II can be synthesized by the known reaction 4 EMI3.2 In this equation, R, R , and M are as defined above. The base ions represesented by M in a ketene mercaptide used in this invention, of formula II come from the base material used in the reaction of a dialkyl malonate with carbon disulfide, as is obvious from the reaction path of equation 4 schematically shown above.While any base material having reactivity toward a 1,1dihalogenoethylene can be used in this invention, typical examples of the mercaptan salts are dipotassium salt and disodium salt in the formula II . Besides these salts, diammonium salt can be used in the process of this invention. The ester moieties of a compound represented by formula II come from the dialkyl malonate used in reaction 4 given above. In this case, the two lower alkyls may be the same or different. Both the lower alkyls include methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, sec butyl, and t butyl. Consequently, the compounds represented by formula II include the ketene mercaptides derived from the following malonates dimethyl malonate, diisopropyl malonate, diethyl malonate, di n propyl malonate, diallyl malonate, di n butyl malonate, diisobutyl malonate, di tert butyl malonate, di sec butyl malonate, methyl ethyl malonate, methyl isopropyl malonate, methyl n propyl malonate, ethyl isopropyl malonate, methyl isobutyl malonate, ethyl n butyl malonate.A typical one of these malonates is diisopropyl malonate, and consequently typical dialkyloxycarbonylketene dimercaptides of formula II include the following compounds Diisopropoxycarbonylketene disodium mercaptideEMI5.1 pale yellow crystal m.p. 1830C or more yellowing Diisopropoxycarbonylketene dipotassium mercaptideEMI5.2 pale yellow crystal discolors at 102 109 C while foaming decomposes into black matter at 3000C or more l,l Dichloroethylene to be used in this invention include l,l dichloroethylene and l,l dibromoethylene, but the use of the former is more advantageous. Process 3 of this invention can be accomplished by reacting a ketene mercaptide represented by formula II and a l,l dihalogenoethylene. This reaction is an equimolar one, but either of reactants may also be used in excess for example, a l,l dihalogenoethylene is used in an amount ratio of 1 to 8 moles, preferably 1 to 3 moles, per mole of the mercaptide used. This reaction is carried out in a solvent not inhibiting the reaction preferably in a polar solvent such as, for example, dimethylsulfoxide, N methylpyrrolidone, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, hexamethylphosphoramide, Sulforane tetrahydrothiophen l,l dioxide , or the like, of which dimethylsulfoxide is most preferable. This reaction in this invention can also be carried out in a mixture of water polar solvent because the above solvents, even if they are mixed with water, have enough solvent power. The reaction temperature can be selected suitably from within the range of about 100C to the boiling region of the solvent used. Usually, appropriate reaction temperature lies between room temperation and about 800C, and preferably is 500C to 800C. After completion of the reaction, the object matter can be isolated according to a usual separation method for instance, the object matter can be obtained by extracting it from the reaction mixture in a suitable solvent, followed by a suitable method to remove the solvent. Meanwhile, it has been found that the above ketene mercaptide which has been obtained as a reaction mixture on synthesis can be used as it is for the ring closure reaction. That is, it can be used without being isolated from the reaction mixture. This method will be illustrated hereinbelow. When a dialkyl malonate is reacted with carbon disulfide in the presence of a base, the corresponding dialkyloxycarbonylketene dimercaptide can be obtained in the reaction mixture nearly quantitatively. Said ketene dimercaptide can also be obtained in an alkaliwater solvent Japanese Patent Application Laid open Nos.99110 1973 and 24265 1975 or in a polar solvent Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 13174 1974 . Thus, this invention also provides a process for producing l,3 dithiol 2 ylidene malonates by reacting dialkyl malonates, in the presence of a base, with carbon disulfide and successively with a l,l dihalogenoethylene. This reaction is conveniently carried out by use of a polar solvent or a mixture thereof with water.The water in this case is generally brought from the aqueous solution of the base. Sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are typical examples of the preferred base, and ammonia can also be used, but potassium hydroxide is particularly preferable. The amount of the base used may be about 2 to 3 moles per mole of the dialkyl malonate used. The reaction of dialkyl malonates with carbon disulfide is desirable to start at a temperature not exceeding 300C since it is exothermic, and thereafter it may be carried out at a temperature of about 50 to 800C. Carbon disulfide is desirable to use in an amount ratio of about 0.9 to about 1.2 moles per mole of the dialkyl malonate used. The process of this invention involves the following embodiments, but is not limited thereto 1 Reguired amounts of a dialkyl malonate, carbon disulfide, and of a l,l dihalogenoethylene are put together with a plar solvent in a vessel, and a required amount of an aqueous solution of a base is added thereto, whereby reaction is carried out 2 Required amounts of a dialkyl malonate and of carbon disulfide are put in a polar solvent, and an aqueous solution of a base and subsequently a 1,1dihalogenoethylene alone or dissolved in a polar solvent are added thereto, whereby reaction is carried out 3 To a mixture of required amounts of a dialkyl malonate and of carbon disulfide, an aqueous solution of a base and subsequently a polar solvent containing a required amount of l,l dihalogenoethylene are added thereto, whereby reaction is carried out. 4 A resulting mixture of the reaction of a dialkyl malonate with carbon disulfide and an aqueous solution of a base is added to a polar solvent containing a required amount of a l,l dihalogenoethylene, whereby reaction is carried out. After completion of the reaction, the object matter can be isolated by a method mentioned above. The following compounds are typical examples that can be synthesized according to the process of this invention.

Dropping thereto a 35 potassium hydroxide aqueous solution 40 g, 0.25 molKOH at 13 17 C gave a pale yellowish red solution containing diisopropoxycarbonylketene dipotassium mercaptide. After addition of l,l dichloroethylene 14.4 g, 0.15 mol to this solution at 200C, the temperature was gradually raised to 700C to carry out reaction for 30 minutes. Then, the resulting mixture was poured into ice water, and extracted with benzene.Drying of the extract over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, distillation to remove benzene, and recrystallization from ligroin gave 21.6 g of the object matter, diisopropyl 1,3 dithiol 2 ylidene malonate, m.p. 60.5 C, yield 75 .Example 2 Diisopropyl malonate 18.8 g, 0.1 mol , carbon disulfide 7.6 g, 0.1 mol , and l,l dichloroethylene 14.4 g, 0.15 mol were dissolved in 100 ml of dimethylsulfoxide, and a 35 potassium hydroxide aqueous solution 40 g, 0.25 mol ROH was dropped thereto.
