# Method of and device for speech signal coding and decoding by vector quantization techniques.

## Abstract
This method provides a filtering of blocks of digital samples of speech signal by a linear prediction inverse filter, whose coefficients are chosen out of a codebook of quantized filter coefficient vectors, obtaining a residual sig nal subdivided into vectors. The weighted mean square error made in quantizing said vectors with quantized re sidual vectors contained in a codebook and forming excita tion waveforms is computed. The coding signal for each block of samples consists of the coefficient vector index chosen for the inverse filter as well as of the indices of the vectors of the excitation waveforms which have generated minimum weighted mean square error. During the decoding phase, a synthesis filter, having the same coefficients as chosen for the inverse filter, is excited by quantized residual vectors chosen during the coding phase.
