# Battery charger and power supply circuitry.

## Abstract
A transformerless battery charging circuit is described including a rectifier 10 , a semiconductor switch 12 , in series with the battery 14 , a sensing network 16 monitoring battery voltage, a trigger circuit 18 responsive to the sensed battery voltage for controlling operation of the semiconductor switch 12 , and a voltage regulator 20 for regulating output voltage of the rectifier 10 as supplied to the triggering and battery voltage sensing networks. The circuitry in combination with an appropriate rechargeable battery 14 also serves as a power supply to drive a DC load connected to the battery 14 .
