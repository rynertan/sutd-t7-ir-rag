# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RETROFITTING A CONVENTIONAL AUTOMATIC SCREW MACHINE TO ACCEPT NUMERICAL CONTROL

## Abstract
A conventional single spindle automatic screw machine, which includes a number of conventional operating machine mechanisms to perform the machine functions, is retro fitted with air cylinder air solenoid combinations actuatable by electrical signals to control the operational sequence of the machine mechanisms, replacing the existing mechanical system of trip drums and trip dogs which perform that function. Also, the driving means which control the move ment of the turret and the cross slides, and hence, the machine tool, relative to the work piece, is disconnected from the machine motor and made independently controll able by the addition of servo or stepping motors which are actuatable by external electrical signals. The electrical sig nals for control of the added motors and the air cylinder air solenoid combinations are provided by a numerical control apparatus.
