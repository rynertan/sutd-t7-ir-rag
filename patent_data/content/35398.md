# Rotor for sedimentation field flow fractionation.

## Abstract
A long, thin annular belt like channel is designed for use in sedimentation field flow fractionation. This channel, which is the rotor of a centrifuge, is designed to maintain its thickness dimension constant and yet facilitate its manufac ture and cleaning by forming the rotor of a double mating ring in which the inner ring 58 is split at 60. This permits the inner ring 58 to conform to the outer load carrying ring 56. The channel is defined by groove 70 and the inner ring is urged against the outer ring 56 by wedges 69. Ports 12 and 14 give fluid access to the channel 70.
