## Description
TRANSPORTATION DEVICEThe invention relates to a transportation device or conveyance for towing a ski or skate wearing individual, usually at speed, upon a surface either as a utilitarian or recreational function.Personal ground conveyance is usually achieved by means of a self powered or towed vehicle upon which one or more individuals either stand or are seated. In aquatic transportation, individuals can be towed on skis behind a vehicle, usually a power boat, but this means of conveyance has never been deployed for ground transportation either in a utilitarian or recreational context.According to the invention, there is provided a personal conveyance for transporting a ski eg. grass ski or skate wearing individual upon a surface as a utilitarian or recreational function, the device comprising a carriage, traction means supporting the carriage upon said surface, power means coupled to said traction means and handle means extending away from and above the carriage for gripping by the individual.The conveyance will conveniently be a rapid conveyance device provided with power means so coupled to the traction means as to tow or otherwise transport the individual at speed eg. a speed greater than 5mph . The speed of conveyance will vary according to requirements but the conveyance will, for example, conveniently be powered to provide speeds of 10mph or more, for example a speed of 12mph or more eg. at least 15mph, such as 15 30mph . Speeds of up to 60mph can be achieved. The conveyance may, however, be powered to provide more moderate, although still comparatively rapid, speeds of 5 to 10mph eg. 6 to 8mph .The power means may be electrical and this may be preferable for utilitarian conveyances. However, the power means will in most cases preferably be in the form of a small capacity less than 250cc internal combustion engine, conveniently a petrol driven engine of, for example, one or two reciprocatory cylinders. An engine of suitable size and type is an engine, normally air cooled, of about 50 to 200cc eg. 50 to 150cc, such as 125cc such as conventionally used to power motor scooters and motor cycles The traction means may conveniently be one or more driven wheels but may be one or more caterpillar tracks.In the case of a wheeled conveyance, one wheel conveniently disposed beneath the centre of mass of the conveyance may be sufficient for all purposes. One such wheel is preferred for recreational uses since this facilitates banking to accomodate fast sharp turning. Two spaced apart wheels may be used, however, and will generally be preferred for a utilitarian conveyance where, for example, stability in motion and ability to park may be important. Two such wheels will in general be disposed at the extremities of a common axle but may be mounted to separate shafts.Wheels whenever used in any conveyance according to the invention may be pneumatically tyred but may be rimmed with non pneumatic, preferably soft, rubber tyres.Tracked conveyances according to the invention will normally be provided with a pair of parallel tracks at the lateral extremities of the carriage, the tracks conveniently taking the form of endless belts of natural or synthetic rubber material. Drive sprockets, one or more for each belt, will conveniently have common drive and be driven at constantly matched speed since directional change can be accomplished by steering from the handle means. Provision for differential speed of drive of the two belts may, however, be provided.In general, the power means will couple drive only to the traction means since no additional powered function will normally be present.The carriage will normally include a housing containing the power means and a fuel or energy supply.The handle means may carry control means for enabling the transported individual at least to stop and start driven movement of the conveyance.Such control means will conveniently include means to engage and disengage drive from the traction means, for example a clutch control when a clutch is provided in association with the power means, but may simply be a means to stop and start operation of the power means. The control means will preferably include means to control the speed of the conveyance, for example a throttle in the case of a conveyance powered by an internal combustion engine.The handle means may be hinged to the carriage so as to allow pivotal movement of the handle in a vertical plane such as may be required to accomodate individuals of varying height and variations in physical stance during conveyance. A fixed non pivotal handle means may, however, be preferred, particularly for recreational use, since urging of the handle means downardly by a user will apply his weight and force to the traction means so as to increase traction.The handle means will, for example, take the form of an elongate stem extending from the carriage and terminating in a handle bar or pair of manually grippable bars. The stem will preferably comprise two elongate members, for example two tubular metal members or alternatively and preferably from a low weight point of view the stem may be a plastics moulding.The conveyance will normally be portable and as such will be made of light weight components. To facilitate carrying by an individual, the handle means will normally be collapsible so that a part thereof forms a carrying handle and so that when carried by hand from such handle, the conveyance clears the ground without the need for the individual to raise or bend his arm.Tractability in use of a conveyance having the light weight characteristics desirable for portability can be achieved by provision of separate disposable weights. For example, rocks or similar ballast material may be used to provide the ground weight needed for tractability and a ballast receptacle may be provided as part of the conveyance. Alternatively, the individual s weight can be employed to the same end by reversing drive or handle means positioning, the individual then stradling the handle means, facing away from the carriage.The conveyance of the invention may be used to transport a ski or skate wearing individual on a variety of surfaces. Grass skates for transport on grass will perhaps be most common for recreational use. Road skates eg. roller skates may be worn for hard surface transport. Ice skates or snow or water skis may be used for transport on those surfaces.Description of the Preferred EmbodimentsThe following is a desciption of preferred embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a front view of a first embodiment of the invention Figure 2 is a plan view of the conveyance shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a cross section of the conveyance shown in Figures 1 and 2 taken along the line III III of Figure LI Figure 4 is a cross section taken along the line IV IV of Figure 3 andFigure 5 is a simplified drawing showing in plan part only of a single 4heeled conveyance forming a second embodiment of the invention.
