## Description
Mineral Enrichment Composition and Method of Preparing Same The present invention is concerned with novel mineral containing polymeric compositions of matter which are highly useful as enrichments for foods and the like. More particularly, it is concerned with such compositions and methods of synthesis thereof, wherein the compositions exhibit very high dispersibility in aqueous media, thereby rendering the compositions useful as fortificants in a wide variety of applications. The food industry has long sought stable water dispersible forms of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, iron and other trace elements in order that significant amounts of these essential nutrients can be introduced into food systems without adding attendant superfluous bulk. To be effective in such contexts, the mineral containing substances must be essentially odorless, colorless, tasteless, and be produceable at modest cost.In addition, such products must exhibit stability when subjected to the condition extremes dictated by formulation, processing and storage. In the past several years, fabricated foods have been rapidly increasing in number, and their appeal has increased because of enhanced organoleptic properties, convenience, and economic and nutritional values. For example, a variety of fabricated non dairy foods exemplified by margarine, imitation ice cream, non dairy creamers, whipped topping mixes and prewhipped toppings have made a major impart on sales of counterpart traditional foods and beverages. Similarly, there is increasing acceptance in the marketplace for non dairy milks which may be completely free of milk protein. A major problem confronting the fabricated food industry is in designing or formulating products which are essentially equal to their natural counterparts on a nutritional basis, particularly with respect to mineral content. For example, in the case of non dairy milks it has heretofore been impossible to provide the desired amounts of calcium, inasmuch as there has been no relatively inexpensive and readily available calcium containing composition which will remain in aqueous dispersion. As can be appreciated, it does little good to supply a calcium source with a non dairy milk if the calcium simply precipitates to the bottom of the container and is never ingested.The problem of solubility or dispersibility in aqueous media is also present to a greater or lesser degree with respect to other vital nutrients such as magnesium, iron, copper, boron, zinc, manganese and molybdenum, and therefore use of these nutrients has been limited in fabricated foods. It has also been suggested in the past that significant nutritional benefits could be gained if vital mineral nutrients were applied directly to the soil during irrigation procedures so that plants growing in the soil could take up the nutrients.Such a procedure has come to be called fertigation . However, such proposals have found only limited use in the past for the reasons outlined above, i. e., lack of mineral containing compositions which have adequate dispersibility in aqueous media. The products of the invention also have utility in connection with solid foods. For example, they may be sprayed onto virtually any solid foods for nutritional fortification purposes.In addition, various metal containing compositions in accordance with the invention should be useful in drug, cosmetic or other chemical applicatiuns where the presence of metals is desired. U.S Patents Nos. 3,428,624 and 3,375,168 describe, respectively, the production of calcium sugar phosphates and water soluble phosphate compositions. However, the products described in these patents are not believed to have been successful in the marketplace, and certainly have not solved the problems outlined above. Our co pending European patent application No. 79302179. 1 describes mineri containing polymeric compositions of matter having high aqueous dispersibility, and methods of synthesizing the same, are disclosed which permit nutritionally important elements such as calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, iron and certain trace elements to be added in aqueous form to foods of all types without adversely affecting taste qualities.The compositions generally are high molecular weight species having moieties of the generalized formulaEMI3.1 wherein M1 and M2 are taken from the group consisting of calcium, magnesium, iron, copper, boron, zinc, manganese and molybdenum, arsenic, silver, aluminium, barium, bismuth, mercury, nickel, lead, platinum, antimony, and tin, A1 and A 2 are respectively taken from the group consisting of hydrogen and the alkali metals, and X is an organic acid moiety having at least three carboxyl groups therein preferably citrate . The synthesis includes the steps of admixing in water a cation source, a potassium phosphate source and an organic acid, followed by heating and further agitation. Dispersibility of the compositions is enhanced by the use of hydroxyl containing adjuncts such as sugars or the like.Edible forms of the compositions hereof find particular utility as nutritional fortificants in traditional or ersatz foods in addition, the compositions may be very useful in fertigation programs where minerals are applied to the soil during irrigation. Nonedible forms can be useful in virtually any context wherein dispersibility is desirable. In its broadest aspects, the present invention is concerned with compositions of matter which are generally of polymeric or quasi polymeric form and it is theorized that they have high molecular weights of at least about 300, 000. The compositions contain polyvalent cations taken from the group consisting of beryllium, cadmium, cerium, chromium, cobalt, selenium silicon, strontium, titanium and vanadium and surprisingly exhibit high degrees of dispersibility or solubility in aqueous media. The compositions also include an organic acid moiety having at least three carboxyl groups therein, such as a citrate moiety other acids may include HEEDTA N hydroxyethyl ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and DT PA diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid .In some instances adjuncts such as maltodextrins and corn syryp, ranging in D.E. from 1 100, sucrose, dextrose, galactose, arabinose, ribose, xylose, maltose, lactose, raffinose, fructose, polyalcohols, i. e.,glycerin or propylene glycol can be associated with the overall compositions to give an increase in dispersibility. Additional adjuncts found to be useful include the amino acids, starches, whey, the caseinates, and hydrolyzates of animal, vegetable and marine protein sources. Other specific adjuncts may incluSeAPCA ethylene bis alpha imino ortho hydroxyphenylacetic acid and NN bis 2 hydroxy 5 sulfobenzyl glycine. A method of synthesis of the mineral containing compositions is also in the ambit of the invention, and broadly comprises the steps of admixing, in water, a cation source, a hydrogen, alkali metal or ammonium phosphate source, and an organic acid having at least three carboxyl groups therein. The molar ratio of the hydrogen, ammonium and or alkali metal ions to phosphate ions is preferably within the range of from about 1 1 to 6 1. The final step in the process involves heating the admixture for a sufficient period of time and at a temperature to yield water dispersibleproducts. Such products can be stored for relatively long periods of time at varying temperature conditions while nevertheless maintaining the desirable dispersibility in water or other aqueous media1 particularly when kept under relatively sterile conditions. Mineral containing compositions in accordance with the present invention include a moiety of the generalized formulaEMI5.1 wherein M1 and M2 are respectively taken from the group consisting of beryllium, cadmium, cerium, chromium, cobalt selenium, silicon, strontium, titanium and vanadium, A.1 andA2 are respectively taken from the group consisting of hydrogen, ammonium and the alkali metals, and X is an organic acid moiety having at least three carboxyl groups therein. In preferred forms, A1 and A2 are respectively taken from the group consisting of hydrogen, ammonium, lithium, potassium and sodium, and said acid moiety is a citrate moiety of the formulaEMI5.2 so that the overall moiety, in the most preferred form, has the following generalized formula EMI6.1 Analyses of the compositions of the invention have indicated that the compositions are quite ionic in character. Thus, the generalized formulae I and III may be more properly written as follows EMI6.2 wherein n is at least 2. The dotted line representations illustrated in formula Ia and IIIa are intended to indicate an ionic type attraction, as opposed to a classical covalent bonding situation. Although formula Ia and IIIa have been provided for completeness, and to depict what may be the proper bonding structure, it is to be understood that the invention is in no way limited to ionic or covalent bonding, or any theory relating thereto rather, the compositions of the invention are best illustrated in a generalized way by formulae I and III , which are intended to be generic to the corresponding formulae Ia and IIIa . In particularly preferred forms the compositions of matter are in the form of polymers or quasi polymers having a molecular weight exceeding about 300, 000, with the depicted moieties, or analogs thereof, being recurrent throughout the compositions. As is demonstrated in the Examples below, the compositions in accordance with the present invention exhibit surprising and very high dispersibilities in water or other aqueous media.Generally speaking, the compositions of the invention should exhibit an aqueous dispersibility such that at least about 30 by weight of the theoretically available, non alkali metal cations present therein are dispersed in water at ambient temperature. In preparative procedures, cation containing products of the invention having high degrees of dispersibility are made by first forming an admixture in water of respective quantities of 1 a cation source selected from the group consisting of compounds of beryllium, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, selenium, silicon, strontium, titanium and vanadium 2 a hydrogen, alkali metal or ammonoum phosphate source, most preferably selected from the group consisting of potassium phosphate, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, a mixture of ammonium and or potassium hydroxide and phosphoric acid, and potassium dihydrogen phosphate and 3 an organic acid having at least three carboxyl groups therein. The molar ratios of the starting materials should preferably be as follows for phosphate ion to acid, from about 0. 5 1 to 3 1, most preferably about 1 1 for hydrogen, alkali metal and or ammonium ions to phosphate ions, from about 1 1 to 6 1, most preferably about 2 1 for non alkali metal cations to phosphate, from about 9 5 1 to 3 1, most preferably about 2 1, for non alkali metal cations to acid, from about 1 1 to 5 1, most preferably about 2 1 and for hydrogen, alkali metal and or ammonium ions to acid, from about 0.5 1 to 7 1, most preferably about 2 1. In addition1 for best results the starting admixture should be stoichiometrically balanced to achieve the desired end composition. The next and final step of the method involves simply heating the admixture for a sufficient period of time and at a temperature to yield the desired products. Preferably, this involves heating the admixture to a temperature of from about 1500 to 4000 F., and thereafter further admixing the admixture at this temperature for a period of from about 10 minutes to 7 hours, more preferably for a period of from 10 to 60 minutes. A wide variety of adjuncts have been found useful for incorporation with the compositions of matter of the invention.Such adjuncts include the amino acids, whey, the caseinates, sugars and starches. These adjuncts serve to enhance the aqueous dispersibility of the mineral compositions. In cases where a preferred hydroxyl containing adjunct such as corn syrup, glycerine, sucrose or dextrose is used, this should be added cold with the initial ingredients with thorough mixing. In most cases the initial admixture should contain at least about 60 percent by weight water1 and in many instances significantly more than this figure. Although not absolutely critical to the production of desired compositions, it has been found desirable to add the respective components of the admixture by first adding the cation source to water followed by a period of mixing of from about 1 to 5 mintues then adding the alkali metal phosphate source with mixing for a period of from about I to 5 minutes and finally addition of the organic acid preferably citric acid with mixing for a period of from about 1 to 5 minutes.At the end of this stepwise addition and mixing process, the described heating and further mixing step can be effected. If it is desired to produce a dry, reconstitutable product, it is generally preferred to homogenize the aqueous product or subject it to high shear mixing followed by drying e. g., spray drying or drum drying . The resultant solid or granular product can be reconstituted in aqueous media and exhibits substantially identical dispersibility properties as compared with the original liquid. The products of the present invention can be stored virtually indefinitely without loss of their desirable properties, and are admirably suited as fortificants in connection with fabricated human or animal foods such as non dairy milks and the like. In addition, the products have significant utility as fertigation or foliar plant nutritional agents. The following Examples illustrate the compositions of the present invention, methods for synthesizing same, as well as the utility thereof. However, nothing in the following Examples should be taken as a limitation upon the overall scope of the invention.Examples 1 10 In this series of runs, a large number of compositions in accordance with the invention were produced, with various reactants and reactant ratios being tested. In the runs, the compositions were made as follows In each case except as noted 1 a round bottom stainless steel, jacketed kettle was employed having a mixing element therein. Respective quantities as set forth in the following examples of water, adjunct where used and cation source were first mixed under the specified time temperature conditions. At this point the phosphate source was added, with additional mixing for about 2 minutes. The organic acid usually anhydrous citric acid was then added and mixing was continued under the listed time temperature conditions. During these mixing steps, cold tap water was fed to the kettle jacket to maintain the temperature of the reactionraixture at about 100 F. or below. After the initial mixing step was completed, a steam water mixture was directed to the kettle jacket to begin heating the meterial therein. Mixing was continued during this step.When the temperature of the mixture reached about 200 F., a steam water mix was employed to maintain the temperature level, and a final mixing step of about 30 60 minutes was conducted. In certain instances the products were homogenized 30004000 psi first stage, about 500 psi second stage , and thereafter spray dried or drum dried to yield a powdered product which could be reconstituted in water. The runs were analyzed for cations in solution, in order to determine the dispersibility of the resultant compounds in aqueous media. Cations in solution were determined by preparing 1 w v dispersion in deionized water1 whereupon the dispersions were centrifuged for about 3 minutes at high speed. The yields were then determined by atomic absorption or emission techniques using conventional procedures. The nitrogen yield data was obtained by measurement with an ammonium ion selective electrode after Kjeldahl digestion of the compound. EXAMPLE 1TABLE 1Reaction Mixture moles Temp. F. Time min.
