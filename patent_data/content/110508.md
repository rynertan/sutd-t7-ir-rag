# Method for desulfurizing a molten iron by injection.

## Abstract
Injection desulfurization of a molten pig iron is carried out in a low cost by using powdery CaCOâ‚ƒ obtained by pul verizing limestone as a desulfurizing agent. This injection desulfurization also can be attained by using a powdery mixture in which a main ingredient is said powdery calcium carbonate and not more than 30 by weight of powdery quicklime is added thereto, a powdery mixture in which a main ingredient is said powdery calcium carbonate and 5 20 by weight of a carbonaceous material and 2 15 by weight of at least one of halides of alkali and alkaline earth metals are added thereto, or a powdery mixture in which a main ingredient is said calcium carbonate and 5 20 by weight of a carbonaceous material, 2 15 by weight of at least one of halides of alkali and alkaline earth metals and not more than 30 by weight of powdery quick lime are added thereto, as the desulfurizing agent.
