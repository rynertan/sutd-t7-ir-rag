## Description
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, in which a photolacquer mask is provided on a 001 or equivalently orientated surface of a monocrystalline layer of gallium arsenide, after which the layer is etched in a basic solution of hydrogen peroxide. The term 001 or equivalently orientated surface is to be understood herein to mean a surface which extends parallel to one of the crystal surfaces 001 , 010 and 100 of the monocrystalline layer of gallium arsenide. As appears, for example, from J. Appln. Phys., Vol. 44, No. 9, September 1973, pages 4172 4176, with a basic solution with pH 6 of hydrogen peroxide an epitaxial layer of gallium arsenide can be etched with a high selectivity with respect to a layer of gallium aluminium arsenide. Such a high etching selectivity is very desirable, for example, in the manufacture of semiconductor lasers or laser diodes. From J. Electrochem. Soc., Solid State Science and Technology , Vol. 130, No. 12, December 1983, pages 2427 2435, a method of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph is known, in which use is made of strong basic solutions having a pH 9. The acidity of the etching solution is determined here by the addition of sodium or potassium hydroxide or ammonia. The process of etching the 001 orientated layer of gallium arsenide is effected preferentially, which means that, when a groove is etched, which extends parallel to the 110 direction, a groove having a dovetail profile is obtained and, when a groove is etched which extends parallel to the Such a preferential etching behaviour of an etching solution means that the method mentioned in the opening paragraph is suitable only for the manufacture of a very limited number of semiconductor devices. The invention has inter alia for its object to considerably enlarge the usability of the method by enlarging the usability of the etching solution. According to the invention, the method of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph is for this purpose characterized in that the layer is etched in a solution having an acidity which is determined in such a manner that, when a groove extending parallel to a 110 or equivalent direction is etched in the layer, this groove has a V shaped cross section. The term a 110 or equivalent direction is to be understood herein to mean the 110 direction when the groove is etched in a 001 orientated surface, the 011 direction when this is the case in a 100 orientated surface and the 101 direction when this is the case in a 010 orientated surface, that is to say in each of the possible orientations of the layer of gallium arsenide that direction which corresponds to the 110 direction with a layer having a 001 orientated surface. A V shaped groove is to be understood to mean a groove which tapers in do wnward direction, in contrast with a dovetail shaped groove, which widens in downward direction. Due to the choice of the acidity in accordance with the invention, it is achieved that a groove having a V shaped cross section can be etched in a direction which is transverse to that in which a groove having a V shaped cross section is obtained with the known strong basic etching solution. In this case, the V shaped groove extended in the It has surprisingly been found that by a suitable choice of the acidity of the solution of hydrogen perioxide, the usability of the method mentioned in the opening paragraph is considerably enlarged. A preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention is characterized in that the acidity of the solution is determined in such a manner that, when at the same time a groove extending parallel to a The fact that a V shaped groove can be etched in the 110 direction is of great importance in the manufacture of semiconductor lasers, while the fact that a V shaped groove can be etched simultaneously both in the 110 and in the The invention will now be described more fully, by way of example, with reference to a drawing and a few embodiments. In the drawing Figures 1 and 2 show diagrammatically and in cross section a few stages of the manufacture of a semi conductor laser obtained by means of the method according to the invention, and Figures 3 and 4 show shapes of grooves obtained during etching of a 001 orientated layer of gallium arsenide in the 110 and the Figures 1 and 2 show diagrammatically and in cross section a few stages of the manufacture of a semi conductor laser obtained by means of the method according to the invention. In a usual manner, an about 2 µm thick A photolacquer mask 9 is provided on the 001 orientated surface 8 of the monocrystalline layer 7 of gallium arsenide, after which the layer is etched in a basic solution of hydrogen peroxide. By means of such a solution, the layer 7 of gallium arsenide can be etched with a high selectivity with respect to the layer 6 of gallium aluminium arsenide. By the etching treatment, an about 5 µm wide groove 10 directed at right angles to the plane of the drawing is etched into the layer 7 of gallium arsenide. The layer 6 of gallium aluminium arsenide is then practically not attacked. According to the invention, the layer 7 of gallium arsenide is etched in a solution having an acidity pH which is determined so that, when a groove extending parallel to a 110 or equivalent direction is etched into the layer 7 of gallium arsenide, this groove has a V shaped cross section. The term a 110 or equivalent direction has to be understood to mean that for a 001 orientated surface 8 the 110 direction is meant and for a 100 and a 010 orientated surface 8 the 011 and the 101 direction, respectively, are meant. In the embodiment, the groove 10 extends in the 110 direction and the groove 10 has a V shaped cross section. The term V shaped cross section is to be understood to mean a cross section which tapers in downward direction. After the groove 10 has been etched into the layer 7 of gallium arsenide, the photolacquer mask 9 is removed and an about 2 µm thick After mirror surfaces extending at right angles to the 110 direction have been formed, for example by cleaving the assembly of the substrate 2 with the layers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12 provided thereon, the layer 12 and the substrate 2 are finally provided with electrical connections not shown . The groove 10 defines the area at which the current flows through the laser and at which consequently the laser light is generated in the active layer 5. Figures 3 and 4 show a layer 20 of gallium aluminium arsenide, on which a monocrystalline layer 21 of gallium arsenide is formed, which is covered with a photolacquer mask 22. The layer 21 of galliumarsenide is 001 orientated in Fig. 3, the 110 direction extends at right angles to the plane of the drawing, while in Fig. 4 the The V shaped groove, which is etched with a strong basic solution pH 9 , has flat surfaces constituted by In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention, the acidity of the solution is determined so that, when a groove is etched in the In the following examples, a 001 orientated undoped layer of gallium arsenide was etched at room temperature in a 30 solution of hydrogen peroxide. Different substances were added to this solution inter alia for determining the acidity. The gallium arsenide layer was provided with a photolacquer mask, which was provided with slot shaped openings so that it was possible to etch grooves into the gallium arsenide layer both in the 110 direction and in the The pH of the 30 solution of hydrogen peroxide was adjusted by means of the addition of a 10 solution of sodium hydroxide. Table I indicates for both directions in which a groove was etched, what was the shape of the etched grooves in dependence upon the pH of the etching solution. In the Table, a V shaped groove is designated by V and a dovetail shaped groove is designated by Z. When etching in a solution having a pH less than 8.25, a V shaped groove is obtained in the 110 direction and when etching in a solution having a pH of 7.80 to 8.25, a V shaped groove is obtained both in the 110 direction and in the The pH of the 30 solution of hydrogen peroxide was adjusted by means of the addition of a 25 solution of ammonia. The etching results were identical to those in Example I. It should be noted that the shape of the etched groove does not change abruptly in the embodiment described above from the V form to the dovetail form. The mixed forms having a V shaped character are designated in the tables by V and the mixed forms having a dovetail character are designated therein by Z. The acidity of the etching solution may be determined by other bases, such as, for example, potassium hydroxide. In all these cases, corresponding results are obtained. A weak acid may also be added to the etching solution, after which the acidity is adjusted by a base. If, for example, perchloric acid is added as acid and if then the acidity is adjusted by means of ammonia, the etching process is effected more rapidly than in a solution having the same acidity, to which only ammonia is added.
