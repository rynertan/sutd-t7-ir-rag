# HOSE PUMP WITH SQUEEZING ROLLERS

## Abstract
The specification discloses an improved peristaltic roller pump for pumping fluids through a flexible tubing. First and second surge release radii r₁, r₂ are formed on a semicylin drical reaction wall 12 to minimize back surge or fluctua tions in pump line pressure as the pump rollers 40, 41 engage and disengage the reaction wall 12 . Improved sloped or angled sweep vanes 32, 33, 34, 35 are provided in front of each roller 40, 41 for collecting the tubing and directing it through a discharge throat 61, 62 into a path of the oncoming roller thereby minimize jamming, kinking or other entanglement of small diameter tubing when used in a roller pump. A novel and inexpensive construction arrange ment provides for quick simple and precise adjustment of both rollers 40, 41 simultaneously to enable the operator to quickly adjust the pump, or to disassemble the pump for cleaning or sterilization. The pump utilizes a pair of recipro cating pump arms 38, 39 which are actuated by a single cam means 44 to provide for a simultaneous and identical adjustment of each of the rollers 40, 41 with respect to the pump wall.
