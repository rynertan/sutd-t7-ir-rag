# Methods and apparatus for the generation and transmission of signals for echo location and geophysical and other signalling purposes.

## Abstract
Quasi periodic pulse trains are generated and swept in repetition frequency over an octave. Spectral harmonics of the pulse trains which prevent the trains from having a flat power spectrum over a frequency range much greater than an octave are reduced or eliminated by ad justing the shape of the pulses in the trains. By selecting the timing of the pulses, other harmonics are reduced or preferentially augmented. The spectral energy of the si gnals which are generated during a transmission onterval is of the type which possesses an autocorrelation function with a narrow main lobe and low side lobe levels which is especially suitable for echo location purposes such as in geophysical exploration in which seismograms are cons tructed by cross correlation of the signals which are trans mitted with those which are received from geological re flection surfaces.
