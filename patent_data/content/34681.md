# Engine braking apparatus.

## Abstract
An improved compression release engine braking apparatus is provided for internal combustion engines having two exhaust valves associated with each cylinder. To maxim ize retarding power it is necessary that a maximum charge of air be driven into the engine cylinder and that the exhaust valves be opened at an optimum point close to the top dead center of the piston in the cylinder. When the cylinder pres sures are high, a high force is required to open the exhaust valves. The problem in the use of high forces is that the exhaust valve train parts and those constituting the compres sion release engine brake are subjected to elastic deformation which, in effect, increases the clearance in the exhaust valve train causing delays in the opening of the exhaust valves and reducing the time the valves are open. To obviate the men tioned problem a slave piston 140, 140 , 140 of the com pression release brake is relocated so as to register with one of the two exhaust valves 118 and a crosshead assembly 122, 174 in the apparatus is modified so that actuation of the exhaust valve rocker arms 128 will open both exhaust valves 118 in the normal manner during the fueling mode of engine operation while the slave piston of the compression release brake will open only one of the exhaust valves during the engine braking mode of engine operation.
