Welding is carried out between a sonotrode and a con trast means. The apparatus comprises said retractable con trast means 123 and a housing means 98 for receiving the sliders one by one and displacing them between a position un der a pusher for pushing the ribbon and a position under the sonotrode, as well as a means for straightening the ribbon.
