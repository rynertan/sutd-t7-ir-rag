# Arm locus control method and apparatus.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method for controlling the locus of an arm of an arm type robot or the like and discloses a control system which drives a first arm of a two joint arm under open loop control and a second arm under feedback control. The invention also sets forth a bang bang drive system for positioning the first arm in by minimum time control, the detection of the position of the tip of the second arm from the rotational angle of each arm and the detection of the position of the tip of the second arm by means of a position recognizing device. Furthermore, the invention discloses an arm positioning method for rapidly bringing the tip of the arm to a desired position while detecting the positions of the tip of a multi joint arm and its joints by simple calculations.
