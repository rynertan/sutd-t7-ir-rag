# Method and apparatus for electronically controlling fuel injection for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method and an apparatus for electronically controlling fuel injection, in which opening degree of a throttle valve 4 or throttle aperture is sampled periodically at a predetermined time interval to detect change in the throttle aperture for determining deceleration. Upon every determination of the deceleration, a correcting quantity is accumulatively determined so that deceleration is corrected for compensating delay in the control of fuel injection in dependence on magnitude of change in the throttle aperture. An improved engine performance and optimum air fuel ratio control can be accomplished.
