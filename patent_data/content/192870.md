# ANTI ROTATION DEVICE FOR CONTRACTING ROD RING SEALS

## Abstract
Anti rotation device 15 consists of a thin washer 16 having a pair of circumferentially and radially spaced tabs 19, 20 protruding axially from one side thereof which are adapted to be received in the gaps 10, 11 in the inner and outer rings 5, 6 , respectively, of a circumferential ring seal 1 to prevent the gaps 10, 11 from aligning themselves. The tabs 19, 20 are desirably located approximately 180 apart to keep the ring gaps 10, 11 on diametrically opposite sides of the seal 1 .
