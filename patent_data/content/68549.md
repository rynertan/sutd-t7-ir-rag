# Method and apparatus for determining cold flow properties of liquid material.

## Abstract
A method for indicating the ability of a liquid ma terial 1 to flow comprising the steps of supplying pressure pulses from a pressure supply 7 to at least one probe 3 which is surrounded by a liquid sample 1 to be tested, measuring and recording the pressure pulses and deriving from the said recording information as to the no flow condition of the sample. An apparatus for carrying out the method.
