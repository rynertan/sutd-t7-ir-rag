# Motor speed control system and a food mixer incorporating such system.

## Abstract
The drive motor 1 of a food mixer has associated with it a circuit board assembly 9 which comprises a control circuit for regulating the speed of the motor in dependence upon the setting of a user operable knob 7. A tachometer is constituted by magnets 4 mounted on a stub shaft of the motor 1 in association with a pick up coil 150 mounted on the circuit board 9. The set speed of the motor is adjusted by rotating the knob 7 which causes the circuit board to move and hence varies the separation between the pick up coil 150 and the magnets4.

## Description
DESCRIPTION MOTOR SPEED CONTROL SYSTEM AND A FOOD MIXER INCORPORATING SUCH SYSTEM The present invention relates to an electric motor and a speed control system therefor. More particularly, the invention relates to the combination of an electric motor and a speed control system therefor, the speed control system comprising a circuit board with a pick up coil mounted thereon and at least one element driven for rotation by the motor to produce in the coil an ouput signal dependent on the motor speed, the circuit board having circuitry responsive to the output of the coil for controlling the speed of the motor.Such a combination is, of course, well known. In various applications where electric motors are used such as, for example, in food mixers, it is necessary or desirable to be able to adjust the speed of the motor. Where the load on the motor is variable, it is frequently desirable to have closed loop control of the motor speed rather than a simple open loop arrangement. One of the difficulties which arises with open or closed loop controls is the method of adjusting the demanded speed.Specifically, the difficulty which arises is in interfacing a user operable element such as a control knob with the motor speed control circuitry. Previously this has been done by means of devices such as potentiometers or multi position switches but both these have the disadvantage that they involve movable electrical contacts which are subject to wear, dirt accumulation and the production of electrical noise. The present invention seeks to provide an improved arrangement for adjusting the set speed of the motor which does not suffer from the above mentioned disadvantage of the conventional potentiometers and switches. The present invention is characterised in that the position of the circuit board is adjustable relative to the rotational path of said at least one element to adjust the set speed of the motor. Further, preferred features of the invention are defined in claims 2 to 6. The invention further provides a domestic food mixer incorporating the combination of an electric motor and a speed control system according to the present invention. The invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a scrap longitudinal section through one embodiment of combination motor speed control system embodying the present invention Figure 2 is a view of the circuit board of the embodiment of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a section on AA in Figure 2, and Figure 4 is a circuit diagram of the embodiment. In the following, the invention will be described with reference to the speed con trol of the drive motor of a Kenwood A 701 food mixer made by the applicant company the general construction of the mixer is well known and description thereof would therefore be superfluous. In Figure 1 the drive motor 1 of the mixer has a drive shaft 2 projecting from one end and a stub shaft 3 projecting from the other. Mounted on the end of the stub shaft 3 is at least one magnet 4 whose purpose will be explained below. Also mounted on the stub shaft is a cooling fan 5. On the left hand end of the motor 1 is a mounting assembly 6 which carries both a speed control knob 7 which is rotatably mounted on the assembly 6 by means of a shaft 8 and also a circuit board assembly 9 which includes a circuit board 10 on which is mounted the speed control circuitry associated with the motor.The assembly 9 is mounted relative to the mounting 6 by means of two horizontally spaced apart bolts 11 which extend through apertures in a down turned flange 12 on the mounting 6 and in the lower part of the circuit board assembly 9. The apertures in the circuit board assembly are somewhat larger in diameter than the bolt 11 so that the circuit board assembly 9 is loosely mounted on the bolts, so that the assembly 9 can pivot about an axis at A in Figure 1. Springs 14 acting between the flange 12 and the circuit board assembly 9 urge the lower part of the latter leftwardly in Figure 1. Mounted on the circuit board 10 is a pick up coil 150 which, during operation of the motor, has EMF pulses induced in it of an amplitude dependent both upon the speed of rotation of the motor and the separation between the circuit board assembly and the rotational path of the magnets 4. This provides a means of control of the set speed of the motor since, as will be explained below, the speed control circuitry acts to vary the set speed in dependence on the amplitude of the EMF pulses for a given rotational speed induced in the coil 150. As mentioned above, the slack mounting of the circuit board assembly 9 on the bolts 11 allows it to pivot about an axis perpendicular to the plane of Figure 1, this axis being located approximately at A in Figure 1 so that the coil 150 is movable towards and away from the rotational path of the magnets 4. As the circuit board assembly is pivoted anti clockwise in the Figure, the flux linking the coil from the magnets 4 decreases so that the amplitude of the EMF pulses induced in the coil 150 for a given rotational speed decreases. The circuit board assembly 9 also includes a plastics holder 15 on which the circuit board is mounted and this holder 15 is provided with a plate 16 projecting towards the left hand end of the motor and carrying an upwardly directed pin 17. This pin 17 engages in a groove 18 on the underside of the control knob. The radial distance of this groove from the axis of the shaft 8 varies dependent upon the rotational position of the knob 7 so that by turning the knob 7 the pivotal position of the circuit board assembly and thus the distance between the pick up coil 150 and the path of the magnets 4 is manually adjustable. The control knob 7 also has at one part of its periphery a lobe 19 which operates the main on off switch 20 of the mixer so that the control knob 7 has to be turned somewhat from its zero position before the circuitry will energise. Figure 2 shows the circu it board 10 with the coil 150 mounted upon it. As can be seen from Figure 3, the mounting bolts 22 extend through the circuit board 10 and the holder 15 and each have a stud 23 projecting towards the magnets 4. These bolts 22 are made of a magnetically permeable material and together with the magnets 4 and a core not shown of the coil form a magnetic circuit passing through the coil. Figure 4 shows the motor 1 and associated speed control circuitry. The motor I is an AC series wound motor comprising rotatable armature 104 and two field coils 101 and 101 . Corresponding terminals of the field coils 101 and 101 are connected across an alternating current mains supply via the main on off switch 20 and a cut out 24 while the other terminals of the field coils are inter connected by the armature 104 of the electric motor and a triac 105 which are connected in series with one another. Capacitor 102 and resistor 103 serve as a protection network for the triac. The fact that the triac 105 and motor armature are located between the field coils 101 and 101 in the circuit helps to prevent interference produced by the triac from being injected back into the mains supply.Figure 2 shows a heat sink 25 for triac 105 mounted on the circuit board 10. A phase control gating circuit for the triac 105 comprises series connected resistor 106 and capacitor 109 and a resistor 107 and diac 108 which are connected in series with one another between the gate of triac 105 and the junction of resistor 106 and capacitor 109. During each half cycle a gating pulse of appropriate polarity is applied via diac 108 to the gate of triac 105, the time delay between each zero crossover of the mains supply occurring and the next gating pulse being applied to triac 105 being determined by a time constant associated with the phase control circuit. As the delay between each zero crossover and the next gating pulse increases, the amount of power supplied by the triac 105 to the motor armature 104 and the armature torque both decrease. The operation of the phase control is modified by the presence of the circuitry to the right of capacitor 109. This circuitry essentially comprises a capacitor 110 in series with a bridge circuit generally designated 118.The bridge 118 comprises four diodes 111, 112, 115 and 117 arranged in a full wave configuration with one pair of opposite corners of the bridge, namely the DC nodes, being interconnected both by capacitor 113 and a resistor 114 and in the collector cmitter circuit of a transistor 151. The remaining corners, i.e. the AC nodes of the bridge, are connected to the right hand plate of capacitor 110 and the lower plate of capacitor 109 During each mains half cycle, before the diac 108 triggers, a charging current flows via resistor 106 to charge capacitors 109 and 110.The rate of change of the potential across each of these capacitors 109 and 110 will, of course, depend on the respective charging currents supplied to them and because the total current available for charging these capacitors is limited by resistor 106, if more current is drawn by capacitor 110, the rate of increase of the voltage across capacitor 109 with respect to time will be lower so that the time delay between each mains zero crossover and triggering of diac 108, and hence gating of triac 105 will be longer. The current which will flow to charge the capacitor 110 will depend on the voltage at the right hand plate of capacitor 110 and this voltage is determined by that across capacitor 113. Capacitor 113 can be discharged via resistor 114 by the transistor 151 across whose base and emitter is connected the pick up coil 150. Obviously, the faster the motor armature 104 rotates, the greater will be the amplitudes of the induced EMF pulses delivered by the pick up coil 150 to the base of transistor 151.Each pulse from pick up coil 150 causes transistor 151 to conduct thereby providing a discharge path for capacitor 113 via resistor 114, so that transistor 151 s collector current increases with increasing armature speed. Assuming capacitor 113 initially to be discharged at the start of a mains half cycle, it will start to charge as the mains wave form increases in magnitude via capacitor 110 and those diodes of the bridge, for example diodes 111 and 117, which are forward biased during this mains half cycle. Capacitor 109 thus charges more slowly than it otherwise would. This leads to a delay in the diac 108 gating on triac 105. As capacitor 113 is contained within the diode bridge and the only route by which it can discharge is via resistor 114 and the collector to emitter circuit of transistor 151, the effective resistance of the discharge path is dependent on the amplitude of the pulses being supplied by pick up coil 150 and hence the rotational speed of the armature 104.The rotational speed of the armature 104 reaches equilibrium when the charging and discharging currents of capacitor 113 are balanced. Thus, if the armature rotational speed is greater than its equilibrium value the voltage across capacitor 113 will tend to drop and in consequence it will tend to recharge via capacitor 110 thus diverting current from capacitor 109. As a result, gating on of triac 105 during each mains half cycle is delayed so that the armature torque and hence armature speed drop back towards the equilibrium value and this process continues until equilibrium is again reached. A corresponding process occurs when the motor is running below the set speed. It will be appreciated that since the amplitude of the pulses induced in the pick up coil 150 is dependent on the distance of the coil from the magnets 4, by varying this distance, the set speed of the motor can be adjusted. Numerous modifications of the above described apparatus are, of course, possible. For example, the magnets 4 could be replaced by pieces of magnetically permeable material and the magnet placed elsewhere in the magnetic circuit associated with the pick up. Naturally the invention can be used in a wide variety of applications where motor speed control is required. A Zener diode not shown may be connected between the collector and emitter of transistor 151 to protect it in full speed and stalled conditions of the motor.
