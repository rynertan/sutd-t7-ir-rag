# Method for the preparation of spherical microorganism cell aggregates.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method for the preparation of hard, spherical, biological cell aggregates. The method involves recovering the cells from the aqueous medium with a reac tion product of a long chain, polyamine, cationic flocculating agent and a crosslinking agent to form a cell aggregate, filtering the aggregate to form a filter cake and extruding the filter cake through an orifice onto the revolving plate of a spheronizing device which comprises of milled friction plate rotatably mounted in a cylindrical housing.
