# Stationary optical longitudinal refractor.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a refractor R consisting of various flanked dioptric elements Es of transparent material with refractive index higher than 1, characterized in that the elements making up the system have an afocal profile of asymmetrical geometry, such as to allow them to remain in fixed position with time and to concentrate the luminous rays A from the solar source on to an underlying smaller than those of the refractor R in question. The dioptric elements Es making up the refractor R are of the Fresner type but arranged, as said, asymmetrically about a preselected axis of joint X . The luminous rays A are transmitted through the profiled of the various elements at different inclinations. Of these elements, the central one is formed by two half flat convex lenses with different focal points, therefore the central element Ec is afocal. The lower elements Ei with respect to the axis of joint X , that is, those nearest to the horizontal plane T , all have greater dioptric powers than the dioptric power of each of the elements lying above the preselected of join hence the upper elements limit the solar image excursion in the downwards direction, while the lower elements Ei straighten the sun s rays in the upwards direction more efficiently. By keeping the refractor position fixed, the ratio between the refractor profile L width and the dimension L‚ÇÅ within which takes place the maximum excursion of the solar image on the collecting plane is always equal to or greater than 2.
