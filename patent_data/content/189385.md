## Description
This invention relates to a polymeric dispersing agent consisting of a mixture of a mainly symmetrical dipolyesteramide having at least one amino group which is not part of an amido bond, a salt of a diamine and a carboxylic acid and free diamine or free carboxylic acid, which is useful for dispersing solid particles, such as pigments and dyes, in organic liquids. The invention also relates to modified dispersing agents for preparing easily dispersable phthalocyanine pigments and diazopigments respectively, comprising said dispersing agent in admixture with a pigment and an amine. An easily dispersable pigment can also be prepared from the new dispersing agent by means of specified processes. From WO 81 02395 polymeric dispersing agents for dispersing solid particles in an organic liquid are known, consisting of a polyester amide wherein all nitrogen atoms are part of amido bonds page 1, line 35 to 36 . In preparing the dispersing agents care is taken that free carboxylic acid groups, which may be present in the polymer formed or as impurities in the reaction product, are converted into amides by means of a diamine or esterified. Said dispersing agents are suitable for the preparation of dispersions of particles of acidic character as defined by Palle Sörensen, Journal of Paint Technology , volume 47, No 602, March 1975, pages 31 38 for high quality litographic printing inks. The known dispersing agents can however not be used for serveral purposes. As being not sufficiently polar, they can for instance not be used to prepare an easily dispersable pigment from a water slurry of the pigment. The object of the invention is to provide a dispersing agent of greater universal application from which a water emulsion could be prepared, which can be used to disperse solid particles and especially pigments precipitated in non polar and sometimes also in polar solvents as well as during the precipitation, the pigments thus being prevented from agglomeration. Another object of the invention is to provide a dispersing agent giving low viscous dispersions of high solids loadings and having increased stability. The objects of the invention are achieved by means of a dispersing agent having the composition wherein Y is the residue of an amide having up to 12 The dispersing agent of the invention consequently consists of a mixture of a major part of a mainly symmetrical polyesteramide, and a minor part of a salt and a free diamine or carboxylic acid. The polyesteramide comprises a central mono or polyamide, having at least one amino group which is not part of an amido bond, which is believed to come into intimate contact with the surface of the solid particle to be dispersed. To the aminoterminated ends of said amide are linked two polyester chains, which are believed to sterically prevent movements of the polyesteramide when attached to the solid particle and prevent agglomeration of the particles. It has been found that dispersants having a symmetrical structure have better dispersion properties and give a better protection against sterical movements of solid particles after dispersion in organic liquids or solids. It has also been found that the dispersants are more universally applicable when the amide part has no more than 12 amido bonds. In order to promote a greater pigment concentration while maintaining good flow properties in non polar liquids the polyester chains should have a molecular weight of at least 1700 and preferably more. The minor part of the dispersing agent, that is the combination of a free diamine or a free carboxylic acid and a symmetrical disalt of said diamine and two molecules of said carboxylic acid, is believed to promote a quicker approach of the amide part of the polyesteramide to the surface of the pigment particle and also to promote a better emulsion of said polyesteramide in water, which is of value when the dispersing agent is to be added to a pigment in an aqueous slurry. The relative proportion of the constituents of the dispersing agent of the invention can be described by means of percent of the total molecular weight of the dispersing agent. The weight of the major polyesteramide part of the dispersant should be from 84.1 to 98.2 of the total weight of the dispersing agent, a preferable range being 87 to 93 , the remaining 1.8 to 15.9 , preferably 7 to 13 , consequently being ascribed to the minor part of the dispersant. The weight of the salt Z should be from O.2 to 12 of the total weight of the dispersing agent. If the proportion of the salt is to low the dispersing properties will be negatively affected giving inferior dispersing capacity and viscosity as well as inferior pigment loading. If on the other hand the proportion of the salt is to high the properties of the final product will be deteriorated. When for instance a printing ink is prepared there will be problems, such as floating of the ink on the surface of the fountain solution. Another problem is that the lacking of azopigments can be deteriorated. The polyester chains in the polyesteramide of the dispersing agent are preferably derived from a saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydroxycarboxylic acid containing 18 carbon atoms or from a mixture of such hydroxycarboxylic acids and the corresponding carboxylic acids which do not contain a hydroxy group. A useful dispersing agent comprises residues of polyester chains of the formula wherein R is a saturated or unsaturated aliphatic C₁₇ radical, a is 4 7, b is 8 11, and x is from 8 to 68. As examples of hydroxycarboxylic acids which can be used in preparing said polyester chains can be mentioned 11 or 12 hydroxy stearic acids, ricinoleic acid, but also compounds of the formulas Commercial hydroxy acids normally also contain the corresponding carboxylic acid in an amount of 3 20 by weight and are useful starting materials in preparing the dispersants of the invention. As an example of a commercial product can be mentioned hydrogenated castor oil fatty acid mainly consisting of 12 hydroxystearic acid. Mixtures of different hydroxy carboxylic acids can also be used, such as can be derived from tall oil and tallow fatty acids. The carboxylic acid which terminates the polyester chains of the polyesteramide can be saturated or unsaturated and contain 8 to 18 carbon atoms. This carboxylic acid can be the same as or different from the carboxylic acid forming part of the salt Z of the dispersing agent of the formula I and optionally also being present in free form as Q. As examples of carboxylic acids can be mentioned octanoic acid, pelargonic acid, tridecanoic acid, iso tridecanoic acid, stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid and arachidic acid. Typical examples of Y are wherein R is hydrogen, alkyl or alkenyl containing up to 20 carbon atoms, The substituants R₁ and R₂, can when being alkyl radicals for example be lower alkyl containing 1 4 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl and n butyl, or higher alkyl containing 16 20 carbon atoms derived from fatty acids obtained upon hydrolysis of lipids, as tallow or tall oil. Alkenyl radicals R₁ and R₂ are preferably derived from unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid and linoleic acid. The diamine NHR₃ T NH₂, which forms a di salt with unreacted carboxylic acids groups, can be an alkylene diamine or an alkenylene diamine, the chain of which could optionally comprise one or more oxygen or nitrogen atoms. Useful diamines are for instance propylene diamine, tallow alkyl propylene diamine, diaminobutane, hexanediamine, diaminodecane, neopentanediamine, alkyl oleyl diamine, 3 aminopropylmethylamine, 4,7 dioxadecane 1,10 diamine, and trioxatridecane 1,13 diamine. The dispersing agent of the invention can be prepared in several steps. First the aminoterminated mono or polyamide having at least one more amino group which is not part of an amido bond is prepared by reacting polyamines with The reactants are mixed in an organic solvent in an inert atmosphere and azeotropical conditions are maintained. The organic solvent should be an aromatic azeotropical liquid, e.g. toluene, xylene, capable of removing water, but not necessarily solubilizing the reactants. The mixture is then heated to a temperature at which the esterification takes place, that is to 50 260 , and the esterification is allowed to proceed. In order to prepare the polyesteramide which has at least one amino group which is not part of an amido bond, hydroxy carboxylic acid can then be added to the amino terminated amide product having at least one more amino group which is not part of an amido bond as obtained in a prescribed amount to give the desired polyester chain length at the esterification temperature. It is also possible to prepare a complete polyester chain separately, which is then linked to the amide molecule by heating the mixture to the esterification temperature. If a commercial hydroxy carboxylic acid has been used as a reactant, the non hydroxy carboxylic acids contained therein as impurities will terminate the polyester chains. If not, it will be necessary to add carboxylic acid for this purpose, as well as for salt forming. When the polyesteramide part of the dispersing agent has been obtained, the temperature of the mixture is lowered and a diamine is added below 130 C in order to form a salt with the free carboxylic acid groups in the mixture. The product obtained, the dispersing agent of the invention, is a medium to high viscous amber coloured liquid, which can be dissolved in most non polar solvents. The dispersing agent of the invention can be used for dispersing dry pigments or pigments in the form of a press cake in an organic liquid. It can also be used for preparing easily dispersable pigments from water slurries and in flushing operations for the production of concentrated pastes. The dispersing agent can also be used for chipping with resins or thermoplastic materials. Lithographical printing inks will get excellent properties when prepared with the dispersing agent of the invention, basically due to the dewatering characteristics of the agent. Toluene based rotogravure inks and polyamide based flexo inks are other examples of applications which will benefit from the advantages of the present dispersants, giving for instance lower viscosity, better gloss and higher colouring strength. A dispersion of solid particles in an organic liquid containing a dispersing agent of the invention can be prepared by well known methods for the preparation of dispersions. Thus the solid particles, e.g. pigment particles, the organic liquid and the dispersing agent, according to the invention, may be mixed in any sequence and the mixture may then be subjected to a mechanical treatment to break down agglomerates, if any, of solid particles, e.g. by ball milling or roller milling. The solid substance may also be milled alone with the dispersant or in admixture with the organic liquid and the other component s may be added, whereafter the dispersion is formed by stirring of the mixture. The amount of the dispersing agent of this invention in dispersions is preferably from 1 to 40 by weight and more preferably from 5 to 38 by weight based on the weight of the solid particles. Said dispersion preferably contains from 40 to 75 by weight of solid organic particles, and from 50 to 85 by weight of solid inorganic particles, based on the total weight of the dispersion. The organic liquids used for the preparation of said dispersions may be inert organic liquids in which the dispersing agent is at least partially soluble at ambient temperature and which are stable under the conditions at which the dispersions are to be used. If desired, mixtures of organic liquids may be used. Preferred organic liquids are hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons, such as toluene, xylene, white spirit, chlorobenzene, carbontetrachloride and perchloroethylene. Also other organic liquids can be used, for example esters, such as butyl acetate, alcohols, such as n butanol, and vegetable oils. It is particularly preferred to use petroleum fractions. In general the selection of the organic liquids or mixtures thereof used for the preparation of the dispersions will depend on the uses of the product to which the dispersions are to be added. As mentioned above the preferable solid particles are pigment particles. In case of inorganic pigments, these are preferably the ones which contain a metal atom, and as examples of such pigments there may be mentioned titanium dioxide, prussian blue, cadmium sulphide, iron oxides, vermillon, ultramarine and chrome pigments including chromates of lead, zinc, barium and calcium and mixtures and modifications thereof. Such pigments are commercially available as greenish yellow to red pigments under the names primrose, lemon, middle, orange, scarlet and red chromes. The organic pigments are water insoluble metal salts or complexes, particularly Ba, Ca, Mn salts or complexes, soluble or sparingly soluble organic dyes, especially mono, di azo, tetrazo, mixtures of tetrazo, sulphonated tetrazo, and phthalocyanines containing sulphonic groups. Other examples of suitable pigments are described in the third edition of Colour Index C.I. 1975, published by the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colourists and the Society of Dyers and Colourists . Easily dispersible pigments can be prepared by adding the dispersant as an aqueous emulsion or alone, to a slurry containing the components of the pigment before coupling, to a coupled pigment before lacking, to a coupled pigment before boiling or to a coupled pigment before washing and drying. The dispersing agent, in an amount of from 2 to 25 , can be added alone or together with other substances that may have a synergical action together with the dispersing agent, or simply a completing function not obligatory connected with dispersion promotion. Easily dispersable pigments having better rheological and lithographical properties can be produced by means of a modified dispersing agent comprising an aminosulphonated salt of a pigment in addition to a dispersing agent of the invention. The invention also relates to a modified dispersing agent for preparing an easily dispersable phthalocyanine pigment as well as a modified dispersing agent for preparing an easily dispersable diazopigment. The modified dispersing agent for preparing an easily dispersable phthalocyanine pigment comprises a dispersing agent of the invention in admixture with a sulphonated Cu phthalocyanine blue and a diamine. A preferred composition of said modified dispersing agent is 12 16 parts by weight of a dispersing agent of the invention, 5 10 parts by weight of monosulphonated copper phthalocyanine blue and 2 6 additional parts by weight of a diamine NHR₃ T NH₂, wherein R₃ is hydrogen, alkyl or alkenyl containing up to 20 carbon atoms, and T is alkylene or alkenylene containing 2 12 carbon atoms and optionally comprising one or more oxygen or amino bridges. Said preferred modified dispersing agent can be used to disperse 68 81 parts by weight of a phthalocyanine pigment. The modified dispersing agent for preparing an easily dispersable diazopigment comprises in addition to the dispersing agent of the invention, a diamine and a sulphonated diazodyestuff. A preferred composition of said modified dispersing agent is 10 16 parts by weight of a dispersing agent of the invention, 5 10 parts by weight of a disulphonated diazodyestuff and 2 7 additional parts by weight of a diamine NHR₃ T NH₂ wherein R₃ and T are defined as above. Said preferred modified dispersing agent can be added to 67 83 parts by weight of a diazopigment. The invention also relates to a process for preparing an easily dispersable pigment comprising heating under reflux a dispersing agent together with a pigment in an organic solvent mainly of non polar nature for a period of time being sufficient for the compounds of the dispersing agent to divide and adhere to the surface of the pigment, whereupon the pigment is obtained by evaporation of the solvent, characterized in that it is used a dispersing agent of this invention. When a dispersing agent described in the invention or a modification thereof is boiled together with such an organic solvent or mixtures of organic solvents the following physical modifications are obtained The invention further relates to a process for preparing an easily dispersable pigment, comprising milling a dispersing agent of the invention together with a pigment for a period of time being sufficient for the the compounds of the dispersing agent to divide and adhere to the surface of the pigment, characterized in that it is used a dispersing agent of this invention. When any pigment is milled together as a dry matter in a solid solid mixture or in a liquid solid mixture together with a dispersing agent or modification thereof the particles of the pigments are finely divided and covered with a thin layer of the dispersing agents. This process makes the pigment particles much better dispersible in organic vehicles.

No. 21135, which contain sulphonated water soluble azo dyestuffs and amines, substituting part of the amines with the dispersing agents, maintaining an excess of dispersing agent. The same can be done with Cu phthalocyanine blue. Pigment concentrates comprising an easily dispersable agent of the invention and an organic or inorganic pigment in an organic vehicle are useful for preparation of printing inks and paints or for colouring thermoplastic materials. On a solid basis a pigment concentrate normally contains 1 25 of the dispersing agent and 75 99 of a pigment the organic vehicle generally represents up to 50 of the complete concentrate. The organic vehicle could be a solid or liquid substance.
