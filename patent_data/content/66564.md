## Abstract
A device in rock or earth drilling apparatus for rotary drilling including an axially stationary chuck 21 and an axially movable chuck 27 which is rotated by a reversible pressure fluid driven rotary motor 32 having a pressure fluid supply conduit for each direction and which is moved forwards and backwards by a reversible pressure fluid driven feed motor 17 having a pressure fluid supply conduit 18, 19 for each direction, the chucks being actuated to withdraw from or insert in a drill hole a drill string 23 composed by a number of threaded string elements and are also actuated to make or break the joints between the string elements. One of the pressure fluid supply conduits 18 or 19 of the feed motor is connected to one of the pressure fluid supply conduits 37 or 36 of the rotary motor 32 via a conduit 100 so that when breaking or making the joint between two string elements gripped by the two chucks 21, 27 , the feed motor will be actuated to move the axially movable chuck 27 relatively to the stationary chuck 21 in a direction to decrease the pressure on the threads accomplished by the weight of the axially movable chuck and devices such as 32 connected thereto.
