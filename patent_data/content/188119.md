# Method for desalting crude oil.

## Abstract
The salt content of crude oil 1 is reduced by washing it with at least 1 by volume of wash water of lower salinity than the water present in the crude oil and separating 5 the resulting mixture of oil and water into a layer of crude oil of reduced salt content and a layer of saline water containing some oil. The latter is passed through a cross flow mem branch separator 8 and the oil free permeate is removed from the separator as effluent 9 . The oil retentate is recycled 10 from the separator 8 to the washing stage and a quantity of water of lower salinity than the water associ ated initially with the crude oil is added to the washing stage. The quantity of added water corresponds at least to the volume of permeate removed from the cross flow mem branch separator 8 . Since the oil is recycled, the need for oil recovery plant for treating desalter effluent is removed.
