# Process for the manufacture of halogenated hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
2,2 Dichloro 5 methyl 1,1,1 trifluorohex 4 ene, an intermediate in the synthesis of pyrethroid insecticides, is obtained by continuous distillation, preferably under subatmospheric pressure, of a mixture of 5 methyl 2,2,4 trichloro 1,1,1 trifluorohexane, dimethylformamide and lithium bromide, precipitating the chlorofluorocarbons from the distillate with water and separating the desired product from starting material by a further distillation.
