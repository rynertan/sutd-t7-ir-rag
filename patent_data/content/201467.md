# Linear stepping motor.

## Abstract
Stepping motor including a runner 2 and at least one stator 4 relative to which the runner is movably mounted. The stator has at least two mutually parallel magnetising elements 6, 8, 10 each with a groove like space 19 extend ing in the travelling direction of the runner, pole tooth rows 12 being formed on the inside of the defining side walls of said space. The runner 2 carries an armature 18 in each groove like space with tooth rows 20 arranged along the pole tooth rows 12 of the magnetising element such as to close magnetic flux paths in coaction with the element tooth rows, said paths extending in plan via said side walls trans verse the travelling direction of the runner 2 . The parallel armature elements 18 are carried by a common carrying body 16 of non magnitude material.
