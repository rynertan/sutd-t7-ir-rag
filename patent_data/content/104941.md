# DATA STORAGE DEVICES

## Abstract
A data storage device 20 comprises a unitary base casting 21 a plurality of data storage disks 26a, 26b, 26c and 26d , at least one disk having a servo sector prerecorded with two series of alternating servo bursts a brushless direct current drive motor 24 mounted to the base for rotating the disks data transducers 63a, 63b, 63c, 63d, 63e, 63f, 63g, and 63h mounted on a rotary carriage 28 a thermally isolated rotary actuator 40 for moving the carriage means and thereby the transducers an optical encoder 70 having a housing incorporating a light source 82 and a photodiode array 93 and a scale 100 movable between the source and the array in response to movement of the carriage 28 a peak detector for detecting peak amplitudes of the servo bursts and programmed digital computer means including an analogue to digital converter for converting the outputs of the photodiode array and peak detector to digital values processor means for controlling movement of the actuator, via a digital to analogue converter, by counting data track boundaries from the digitised photodiode array signals and track centreline offset values from the digitised servo burst signals to move the transducers between data tracks in accordance with instructions from a user interface and to maintain the transducers in track centreline alignment in accordance with the calculated offset values.
