# Containers.

## Abstract
A container is formed providing a composite wall 14 with reinforcing strips 16 which surround the exterior of the wall at its opposite ends. The container is capped by end closures 24 the edges of which engage the reinforcing strips to deform the strips to both overlap the closure edges and compress the container wall between the strips and the closures.
