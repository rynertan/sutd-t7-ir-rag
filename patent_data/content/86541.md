# System for communication by way of repeatedly transmitted messages, and stations for use in such a system.

## Abstract
A description is given of a system for communication between a transmitting station 30 and a receiving station 33 by way of a message which consists of a direct succes sion of a number of identical code words. Each message uses only a comparatively small part of the capacity of the message channel. Each code word has at least a predeter mined minimum Hamming distance with respect to any other code word, including the cyclic transpositions of the latter code word. Therefore, for the detection and reproduc iton of a code word it is not necessary to realize word synchronization and a given category of errors can still be detected and or corrected. The code words may concern, for example, a transmitter or program identification in a broadcasting system or a paging code for a receiving sta tion in a system comprising selectively addressable receiv ing stations paging system .
