## Description
Title of the Invention Hang type lighting fixture for decoration. Background of the Invention a Field of the invention This contrivance relates to a hang type lighting fixture for decoration particularly composed of a plurality of illumination units. b Prior art Quite a number of hang type lighting fixtures suspended from a ceiling and others and composed of two or more illumination units connected together are commercialized. With such conventional hang type lighting fixtures for decoration, the illumination units are connected or supported with hooking devices at installation then the electrical wiring work is performed separately. Moreover, the wiring work is troublesome as fixing with machine screws is necessary, particulary troublesome for the lighting fixtures composed of a large number of illumination units. Because of the same reason, alteration in the combina tion of said illumination units or cleaning of the illumination equipment is troublesome and takes a long time. To change illumination light and to improve illumination image, a light transmitting globe to cover outside of respective illumination unit is provided. By the conventional globe, however, luminance differs evidently between near positions of the light source and the surroundings, and lamp image can hardly be eliminated and the improvement of illumination image is not very effective.In addition, it is necessary to attach said globe by each illumination unit before installing the lighting fixture. This is accompanied by such disadvantages as breakage of the globe at the time of installation or more intricated work. Summary of the InventionIn view of the foregoing disadvantages of the conventional lighting fixtures, a primary object of this contrivance is to provide a hang type lighting fixture for decoration with which the illumination units connection work completes the electrical wiring work at the same time, yet the work is very easy, and changes in the combination of the illumination units after connection or cleaning is also easy, and the illumination image can be improved easily by eliminating lamp image of the light source. In order to accomplish the foregoing object, an illumination unit according to this invention comprises two hooking members composed of a conductor having a hook at both ends, a bulb connected to each one of said hooking members with an electrode wire, and a glove forming a dent to house said bulb inside a split member made of light transmission glass material, and is characterized in that the upper hook of one illumination unit is set on the lower hook of another illumination unit positioned above the 1st illumination unit.Because of the composition as described above, the hooking members in the illumination units also function as the electrical wiring members, and the connection work of the illumination units comprising the lighting fixture also serves as the electrical wiring work. Accordingly, changes in the layout or combination and cleaning work can be easier. Moreover, by covering the bulb with the light transmitting glass composed in split type, lamp image can be eliminated and illumination image can be improved easily.Other features and advantages of this invention will become apparent in the course of following description together with the accompanying drawings. Brief Description of the DrawingsIn the drawings forming a part of this application, and in which like parts are designated reference numerals throughout the same,Fig. 1 is an outside perspective view of a part of the notch of one illumination unit composing the hang type lighting fixture for decoration as an embodiment of the contrivance Fig. 2 is a side sectional view of the main parts which show the composition of said illumination unit andFig. 3 is a front view showing the condition of use of the hang type lighting fixture for decoration. Description of the Preferred EmbodimentReferring now to the accompanying drawings, Fig. 1 is an outside perspective view of a notched part of one illumination unit comprising the hang type lighting fixture for decoration as an embodiment of the contrivance. One illumination unit is provided with two hookinc members 1, and 2 of the two conducting wires.At the ends of said hooking members 1, 2 , upper hooks la, 2a and the lower hooks lb, 2b are provided respectively.Two hooking members are held by a fixing member 4 made of an insulating material so as not todcpme in contact each other.Two electrode wires of the bulb 6 are inserted into the fixing member 4 and are respectively put in contact with the hooking member 1 and 2 , and the bulb 6 is held by the fixing member 4 .The globe 3 made of light transmitting glass material is attached at approximately the center of the illumination unit.Said glove 3 is approximately in the shape of semicircular cylinder with a dent 3a near the center.Two globes are mounted from both sides of the illumination unit so that the bulb and the fixing member 4 are fitted to said dent 3a , and a ring form spring 5 is fitted and fixed to the pheriphery of the globes 3 .Fig. 2 is a side sectional view showing composition of the main part of the illumination units compsoing said hang type lighting fixture for decoration.The bulb 6 and the fixing member 4 are positioned at the dent 3a formed approximately at the center of the globe 3 composed of light transmitting glass material.A groove not illustrated is formed at the part in contact with the hooking member 1 in the globe 3 , and two globes 3 can be attached to the illumination unit by putting the inside respectively in contact with the illumination unit. The spring 5 formed in ring form is fitted to the groove 3b formed on the peripheral surface of the globe 3 and two gloves are fixed by elasticity of said spring 5 .Fig. 3 is a front view showing condition of use of said hang type lighting fixture for decoration.To the fittings 11, 12 of the attaching device 10 fixed to the surface of ceiling, power voltage is supplied through the power line not illustrated. To each one of said fittings ill, 12 , the upper hooks lea, 2a of the illumination unit A are hooked, and source voltage is supplied to the hooking member of the illumination unit A when the two fittings are connected.In the globe 3 , source voltage is supplied to the bulb connected to the hooking member by the electrode wires and the bulb glows.In addition, source voltage is also supplied to the hooking member of the illumination unit B hooked to the lower hooks lb, 2b of the illumination unit A respectively by the upper hooks la, 2a . Accordingly, the bulb of the illumination unit B also glows in the same manner as the illumination unit A.The same is true with the illumination unit C hooked to the lower hooks lb, 2b of the illumination unit B by the upper hooks la, 2a . As described above, the installation work of the hang type lighting fixture for decoration and the wiring work can be carried out at a time by connecting the hooks formed at both ends of the hooking member of each illumination unit one after another. Installation of the hang type lighting fixture for decoration can be made simpler and alteration of combination after connection or cleaning work can also be made easily.Moreover, lamp image can be eliminated and illumination image can be improved by covering the bulb of each illumination unit with a globe made of light transmitting glass material.The work to detach the globe from the illumination unit at cleaning or bulb replacement can besmade easier by fixing said globe with a spring.It is further understood by those skilled in th q rt that the foregoing description is a preferred embodimentv the disclosed device and that various changes and moditivC N cations may be made in the invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
