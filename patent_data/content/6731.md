# Large scale integrated circuit chip for an electronic organ.

## Abstract
In a modular, expandable organ system comprising a plurality of large scale integrated circuit LSI chips an LSI chip 286 is provided which produces frequencies corres ponding to notes played on an organ keyboard. Outputs of different duty cycles 230, 138, 140, 142, 144 of rectangular waves are provided for best simulating desired sounds. Other outputs are provided in which the notes are in octave groups 244 facilitating filtering thereof. Each group of outputs has different attack and decay 162, 190, 228, 246 charac teristics respectively under the control of the organist so that similar or different typs of attack and decay may be provided on different outputs. The present LSI chip provides three generators 26, 36a, 36b on one chip. The chips are capable of being interconnected 290 such that any multiple of three generators may be provided.
