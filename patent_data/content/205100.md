## Description
The present invention relates to a method and a system for operating a power converter system. Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing an example of a power converter system for power transmission. AC bus lines 1, 1 are connected via transformers 2, 2 to power converters 3, 3 constructed of, e.g., plural thyristors connected in series or parallel. By controlling the firing phase of the convertor, AC current is converted into DC current or vice versa. The system also includes reactors 4, 4 , DC power transmission lines 5, potential transformers P.T. 6, 6 , and current transformers C. T. 7, 7 . The control circuit for the power converter system is constructed of automatic current regulators ACR 8, 8 , constant margin angle regulators CER 9, 9 , and the like. Besides the automatic current regulators 8, 8 and the constant margin angle regulators 9, 9 , an automatic voltage regulator AVR and the like may be provided for maintaining the DC voltage constant. Calculated values by the automatic current regulators 8, 8 and the constant margin angle regulators 9, 9 are inputted as control voltages Ec to minimum value selection circuits LVG 10, 10 automatically selecting a control voltage which leads the control angle of the system to the smallest. The selected control voltages are limited by control voltage limiter circuits EcL 11, 11 respectively and are inputted to phase control circuits PCC 12, 12 which output firing pulses to the thyristors by determining firing phases corresponding to the selected control voltages. As is well known, in the power converter system constructed as above, one of the converters operates as a rectifier under constant current control while the other of the converters operates under constant margin angle control, by switching a current margin I . When a fault occurs in the converters or AC power systems, signals a, a or b, b are applied from protection units PU 13, 13 to the phase control circuits 12, 12 respectively for protection of the converters. The signals a, a are used for a bypass pair operation, while the signals b, b are used for a gate blocking operation. Generally the converters are protected by the bypass pair operation or the gate blocking operation. Also, the power converters 3, 3 require a reactive power during their operations. Therefore, it is common to provide AC filters 14, 14 for removing harmonics and a synchronous condenser 15 for supplying a reactive power. Reference numerals 16, 16 designate the AC power systems, and reference numerals 17, 17 designate circuit breakers. For convenience of description, it is assumed that the converter 3 of Fig. 2 works as inverter and the converter 3 works as rectifier. When a fault occurs in the AC bus line 1 of the system, it is common to protect the system by opening the breaker near the fault point. However, while the converter 3 in the power converter system works as inverter and the inverter operation continues with the breaker 17 at the AC power system opened, energy is fed to the filter 14 from the DC system so that an excessive voltage is generated on the AC bus line. Further, if the converter 3 is stopped by a gate blocking operation to prevent energy from the DC system, there arises a risk of generating an excessive voltage on the AC bus line as well as a risk of self excitation phenomenon of the synchronous condenser 15 to accordingly generate an excessive voltage on the AC bus line 1 because the converter 3 does not consume a reactive power. Furthermore, even if the converter 3 is driven into a bypass pair operation, the converter 3 does not consume a reactive power as in the case of a gate blocking operation. Thus, the synchronous condenser 15 is subjected to a self excitation phenomenon to make the AC bus line have an excessive voltage. Since non conductive valves of the converter 3 under the bypass pair operation are applied with line voltages, excessive voltages are applied to the non conductive valves, resulting in a possibility of breakdown of the power converter system. DE A 1 943 646 discloses a system for operating a power converter connected between a DC bus line and an AC bus line, said AC bus line being provided with a synchronous condenser and connected to an AC power system through a breaker, thereby to control firing angle of said power converter so as to prevent an excessive voltage when a fault or load fluctuation is occurred in the AC bus line. However, an operation is made on the converter working as a rectifier, which converter is provided at an opposite side to the AC side where a failure has occurred. In view of the above described problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a method and a system for operating a power converter connected to an AC power system without generating an excessive voltage. To achieve the above object of the present invention, in a power converter connected to an AC power system provided with a synchronous condenser, if the power converter works as inverter while the synchronous condenser operates and a circuit breaker connected to the AC power system is opened to make the converter station load capacitive, then the power converter is driven in a zero power factor operation to consume a reactive power so that no energy from a DC system is received by the AC power system and an excessive voltage on the AC bus is prevented. Further, if the power converter works as rectifier, the operation may continue as it is to consume a reactive power and prevent an excessive voltage. The embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to Fig. 1 wherein similar elements to those in Fig. 2 are designated by the same reference numerals and the description therefor is omitted. Reference numerals 18 to 21 represent AND gates, reference numeral 22 represents an inverter, 23 a firing angle setting device, 24 a switch, During an ordinary operation the breaker 17 is closed. Therefore, the signal If the converter 3 works as rectifier, energy is not fed from the DC system to the AC system so that the rectifier operation may be continued. In this case, since the signal INV becomes 0 , the zero power factor operation command Signal If the synchronous condenser 15 is not under operation, the signal As seen from the foregoing description of the invention, it is possible to provide a method for operating the power converter system in which, even if the circuit breaker to the AC system is opened while the synchronous condenser operates, an excessive voltage by the self excitation of the synchronous condenser or an excessive voltage by energy fed from the AC power system, does not occur.
