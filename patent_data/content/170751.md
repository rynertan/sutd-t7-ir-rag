## Description
NOVEL CRYSTALLINE ALUMINOSILICATE, PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF, AND PROCESS FOR THE CONVERSION OF ORGANIC MATERIALS USING THE SAME The present invention relates to a novel crystalline aluminosilicate, a process for the conversion of an organic material using said crystalline aluminosilicate, and a process for the preparation of a novel crystalline sodium aluminosilicate. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel crystalline aluminosilicate having a characteristic distribution of Si and A Q, a process for the conversion of an organic material utilizing the molecular shape selectivity and catalytic ability of said crystalline aluminosilicate, and a process for the preparation of a novel crystalline sodium aluminosilicate. Crystalline aluminosilicates, generally known as crystalline zeolites, are aluminosilicate hydrates. Their crystalline structure, whether they are natural or synthetic, are based on a three dimensional framework of an Six 4 tetrahedron, wherein four oxygen atoms centering around silicon Si are positioned at vertices, and of an A 0 4 tetrahedron which is formed by replacing silicon atom of theSiO 4 with aluminum A e It is known that these Ski04 and AS 0 4 tetrahedra form fundamental units of 4, 5, 6, 8, or 12 membered rings formed by the interconnection of 4, 5, 6, 8, or 12 of them and double rings formed by superposing these 4, 5, 6, 8, and 12 membered rings on each other, and that the framework structure of a crystalline aluninosilicate is determined by the interconnection of these units. There are specified cavities in the framework structure determined by the above interconnection. An entrance of this cavity structure is an opening forded with 6, 8, 10, and 12 enbered rings. Openings, described above, have a unified diameter so that only molecules smaller than a predetermined size can be adsorbed, and larger ones, which cannot enter through the openings are not adsorbed. This action of the crystalline aluminosilicate is known as the molecular sieve , , which has been utilized as an adsorbent, a catalyst, or a catalyst carrier for chemical reactions in various chemical processes. In recent years, intensive studies have been made in various fields of chemical reactions for the combined use of crystalline aluminosilicates as the above mentioned molecular sieve and as catalyst. This is the application as a socalled molecular shape selective reaction catalyst, as classified fron the viewpoint of catalyst function by S.M.Csicsery into the following three groups 1 those characterized in that only specified reactants can approach to an active site 2 those characterized in that, after the reaction at the active site, only the substances of the specified shape can leave from the site of reaction and 3 those characterized in that, in a bimolecular reaction, each molecule can freely approach to or leave from the reaction site but they cannot react because the transition state is too large Zeolite Chemistry and Catalysis ACSMonograph 171, ACS, Washington D.C., 1976, p. 680 The above classification is based on a consideration that the reaction occurs only in the cavity of crystalline aluiinosilicate.The catalytic reaction on or near the active site of external surface of crystal is low in reaction selectivity, unlike the catalytic reaction described above, because all kinds of reaction are possible and reactions occur freely beginning with the reaction having small acti vation energy. In order to supress these non selective reactions on or around the external surface of crystals hereinafter referred to simply as the crystal surface , methods of burying active sites by covering the crystal surface with a compound, or controlling the solid acid acidity of the active sites by using alkaline substances or those with different solid acid acidity. Addition of silicon, phosphorus, or magnesium compounds have been suggested. On the other hand, a method of controlling the size of the crystals is known, thereby controlling the ratio of the number of the active sites having molecular shape selectivity in the crystals and that of the active sites not having molecular shape selectivity on or around the crystal surface.For example, when the crystals are large, the ratio of the number of the active sites in the crystals is relatively increased, thereby the molecular shape selectivity increases.However, this results in lower reactivity in general, because of the relative limitation in approach and or contact of the reactants to the active sites. On the other hand, when crystals are small, the reactivity is elevated because of relative increase in the opportunity of approach and or contact of the reactants to the active sites, aothough the molecular shape selectivity is lowered as the result of relative increase of the number of the active sites on or around the crystal surface. The electric charge of the tetrahedral crystalline sodium aluminosilicate, containing aluminum is balanced in an equilibrated state by incorporating sodium cation in the crystal. This cation is well known to act as solid acid catalyst when it is ion exchanged into a hydrogen or metallic ion exchanged type in various methods. It is understood therefore that the places where A A atoms are present are intimately related, directly or indirectly, to those where active sites are present. It is also fully expected that the solid acid strength of an adjacent atom silicon bonded to the A A atom with an interposed oxygen atom is strongly influenced by the neighboring atom silicon or another aluminum to which it is bonded with another interposed oxygen atom. It was elucidated by the so called Loewenstein s rule W. Loewenstein, Am. Miner. 39, 92 1954 that the bond of an aluminum atom to another aluminum atom with interposed oxygen can not exist. It is understood from the above that if the distribution of AA atoms in a crystalline sodium aluminosilicate can be controlled, the solid acid strength itself or its distribution in the crystalline sodium aluminosilicate as catalyst can be controlled freely. Moreover, if the distribution ofA A atoms in crystals can be controlled, the active sites can be concentrated to the inside of crystals or contrarily concentrated on or around the external surface of crystals, whereby the same effect as that, attained when the solid acid acidity is controlled by the coverage with compounds, is expected. The mount of the compounds to be incorporated for modification is also expected to be reduced. Although structures of crystalline aluminosilicates have been analyzed with X ray, most of them only show a socalled framework structure, and there are few works in which exact positions of the silicon and aluminum atoms were determined. It is because the X ray scattering ability of a silicon and an aluminum atoms are very similar, and because relatively large single crystals are hardly obtained. However, since the surface elemental analysis of crystals in the order of micron has become possible by the recent development in surface analyzing technique, it has become possible to discuss about the elemental distribution in crystals. As described above, the electric charge of the aluminum containing tetrahedral crystalline aluminosilicate is balanced in an equilibrated state by cations incorporated in the crystal. In natural crystalline aluminosilicates, they are cations belonging to Group I or II metal of the periodic table, preferably those of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, or strontium. These metallic cations are also used in synthetic crystalline aluminosilicates, but recently the use of organic nitrogen cations, for example, quaternary alkylammonium ions such as tetraalkylammonium ions, are suggested. These nitrogen containing organic compounds were considered essential as an alkali source for the synthesis of crystalline aluminosilicates having a high silica alumina ratio. However, the use of nitrogen containing organic compounds is disadvantageous in high material cost, as well as complicated for the preparation, because they must be removed by firing at high temperatures when the obtained synthetic aluminosilicate is used as catalyst. Moreover, there have been problems in safety of operation in the conventional process wherein the above described tetraalkylammonium compounds or organic amine compounds such as C2 to C 1 0 primary amines are used. Because these organic compounds are dangerous themselves as well as decomposed products of them. Therefore they may bring out various dangers in steps of synthesis, drying, and firing. The present inventors, as will be described briefly below, overcame these problers and provided a process for the preparation of a crystalline aluminosilicate from an aqueous reaction mixture substantially consisting of only inorganic reaction materials Japanese Patent ApplicationNo. 143396 1981 filed on September 11, 1981 . The inventors also elucidated that the obtained crystalline aluminosilicate had a characteristic crystalline structure as shown by the X ray diffraction pattern. The above application was related to a crystalline alusinosilicate having a chemical composition expressed in terms of oxide molar ratios 0.8 1.5 M 2 nO A A 2 0 3 10 100 S i02 z H 2 o, wherein M stands for a metallic cation, n for the valence of said metallic cation, and z for 0 to 40, and having a powderX ray diffraction pattern showing at least the interplanar spacings, namely, shown in Table 1. Table 1Interplanar spacing d A relative intensity I Io 11.2 0.2 S. 10.1 0.2 S. 7.5 0.15 W. 6.03 0.1 M. 4.26 0.07 M. 3.86 0.05 V.S. 3.82 0.05 S. 3.76 t 0.05 S. 3.72 0.05 S. 3.64 0.05 S. The aluminosilicate having the crystalline structure characterized by the above X ray diffraction pattern, which has not been found in literature, was named TSZ. The above values are obtained by the measurement with an X ray diffraction device manufactured by Rigaku DenkiK.K. Geigerflex RAD rA in the ordinary method. Irradiation was carried out with K c doublet of copper. The relative intensity and the interplanar spacings d expressed in terms of angstrom A corresponding to the recorded lines were determined from the height and position of the peak read from the chart as a function of 20 8 Bragg angle by using a scintillation counter provided with a strip chart pen recorder.The relative intensity in Table 1 is evaluated as very strong by V.S. , strong by S , medium by M weak by a W , , and very weak by V.W. . As will be described below, the crystalline aluminosilicate of the above application is characterized by the X ray diffraction pattern obtained by the ordinary powder X ray diffraction method.More particularly, the characteristics which distinguish the crystalline aluminosilicate of the above application most remarkably from the conventional crystalline zeolites in crystalline structure are that the diffraction line of 28 14.7 d 6.03 A is singlet and those of 28 23 d 3.86A and of 28 23.3 d 3.82A are clearly split. The crystalline aluminosilicate of the above application was also subjected to powder X ray diffraction analysis different from the ordinary method, by which 20 8 Bragg angle was measured with remarkably high accuracy. The analysis of the result showed that the crystalline aluminosilicate of the above application TSZ belonged to a monoclinic system crystallographically. For example, the TSZ having a composition of 1.02 Na 2 0 A A 2 3 26.2 SiO2 12.2 112 0, the product of Example 7 in theJapanese Patent Application No.1433396 1981, shows the following monoclinic lattice constant a 20.159 0.004 A, b 19.982 f0.006 A, c 13.405 iO.005 A, and 90.51 0.03 . The observed and calculated values and Miller indices of the interplanar spacing of this typicalTSZ are shown in Table 2. The interplanar spacing of this characteristic X ray diffraction pattern was not much influenced by exchanging the substituting cations of the synthetic aluminosilicate, especially by exchanging to hydrogen ion, and also not influenced by change of the ratioSi O 2 A A 2 0 3 The present inventors have arrived at the present invention as a result of further intensive studies based on the above described previous invention, finding that 1 a crystalline aluninosilicate having a novel crystal possessing remarkable molecular shape selectivity and catalytic ability, in which the distribution of aluminum atoms in the crystal is controlled and the solid acidity Table 2Interplanar spacing Miller index Interplanar spacing Miller indexObserved Calculated hkl Observed Calculated hkl 11.18 A 11.16 A 101 4.372 A 4.369 A 013 10.09 10.08 200 4.272 4.271 421 9.978 9.990 020 4.097 4.093 023 9.765 9.775 111 4.018 4.019 430 9.028 8.999 210 3.863 3.861 501 7.465 7.458 211 3.825 3.820 051 7.095 7.096 220 3.757 3.754 151 6.720 6.703 002 3.727 3.726 033 6.383 6.372 012 3.654 3.653 313 6.013 6.007 301 3.605 3.604 521 5.79 5.738 131 3.490 3.495 323,233 5.587 5.589 022 3.450 3.449 530 5.381 5.386 212,122 3.361 3.360 600 5.150 5.147 231 3.320 3.321 351 5.039 5.040 400 3.259 3.259 333 4.990 4.995 040 3.056 3.055 451 4.624 4.624 312 2.988 2.996 433 distribution is approximately homogeneous can be provided, that 2 such crystalline aluminosilicate can be prepared from substantially inorganic reaction materials, and that 3 such crystalline aluminosilicate brings about good results in selective catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons. The first object of the present invention is, therefore to provide a crystalline aluminosilicate having a characteristic crystalline structure in which the distribution of aluminum atoms in the crystal is controlled. The second object of the present invention is to provide a crystalline aluminosilicate having a high silica alumina ratio and excellent catalytic activity. The third object of the present invention is to provide a crystalline aluminosilicate having a characteristic crystalline structure exhibiting excellent activities in selective cracking of linear hydrocarbons and conversion of aromatics. The fourth object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a crystalline sodium aluminosilicate having a characteristic crystalline structure, in the crystal of which the distribution of aluminum atoms is controlled, from an aqueous reaction mixture substantially consisting of inorganic reaction materials such as silicon, aluminum, alkali metal compounds, and water. The fifth object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a crystalline sodium aluminosilicate, having such Na2 O Ae 2 O 3 sio2 H2 O composition, that enables the reduction in production cost basd on an easy and simple process for the production, without any heat treating process of the product, which has been necessary in the conventional preparation of synthetic aluminosilicates. Further, the sixth object of the present invention is to provide a conversion process for organic materials using as catalyst a novel crystalline aluminosilicate wherein the distribution of aluminum is controlled. Thus, the present invention relats to a novel crystalline aluminosilicate characterized in that the silicon aluminum atomic ratio on the surface of the crystal is substantially not smaller than average value of the silicon aluminum atomic ratio in whole crystal, a process for the conversion of organic materials using said crystalline aluminosilicate, and a process for the preparation of a novel crystalline sodium aluminosilicate. The crystalline aluminosilicate of the present invention TSZ III is of great value for its catalytic activity in a variety of organic reactions including hydrogenationisomerization of normal paraffins, conversion of alcohols into hydrocarbons, alkylation of aromatics with alcohol and olefin, disproportionation or transalkylation between aromatic compounds and so on, especially showing remarkable effects in the cracking of hydrocarbons. Moreover, according to the present invention, such useful crystalline aluminosilicate TSZ m can be prepared extremely easily and economically. Embodiments of the present invention will new be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figures 1 and 2 are graphical illustrations of the relationship between the amount of the desorbed pyridine and temperature. In Figure 1, the solid line shows the results of the gas chromatographic measurement of the sample of the present invention obtained in Example 4, and the broken line shows that of the sample obtined in Comparative Example 5. In Figure 2, the solid line shows the results of the gas chromatographic measurement of the sample of the present invention obtained in Example 1, and the broken line shows that of the. sample obtained in Comparative Example 1. In the present invention the distribution of atoms on or around the external surface of the crystal abbreviated as the crystal surface of the crystalline aluminosilicate was measured by X ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It is necessary to reduce the number of the active sites having no molecular shape selectivity for the elevation of reaction selectivity in selective cracking of linear hydrocarbons, or in isomerization, alkylation and disproportionation of aromatic hydrocarbons. It is important for this purpose to relatively decrease the number of aluminum atoms which tend to for framework on or around the crystal surface.When the sample is irradiated with X ray, photoelectron is released from the sample. Since the electron interact with substances strongly, its mean free path is stall. Therefore the electrons released from the depths of the sample are scattered inside the sample and lose their energy, then they cannot go to the surface. In that case, the depths from which electrons can escape to the surface escape depth depends on the sort of element and the kinetic energy of the electron. Aluminum has an escape depth of 20 A in average kinetic energy 1,500 ev and silicon has about 20 to 40 A kinetic energy 554 1,178 ev . On the other hand, the depths of the crystal is not recognized where the active sites, which have not high molar cular shape selectivity, is able to exist. However, it is assumed that the active sites which are present at 20 A deep or more from the top surface are provided with sufficient molecular shape selectivity, because the size of the crystal is usually within the range of 1,000 A to several tens of thousand A, and the size of the molecules taking part in the reaction is 10 A or less. In the present invention, therefore, X ray photoelectron spectroscopy is the most suitable method of analysis. It is preferred for the measurement by X ray photoelectron spectroscopy to use aluminum K alpha ray as X ray source with an X ray output of 10 kv 20 mA.The measured silicon aluoinum atomic ratio in this way is defined as silicon aluminum atomic ratio on the external surface of a crystal . On the other hand, the silicon aluminum atomic ratio obtained by an ordinary chemical analysis such as atoric absorption is defined as average value of the silicon aluminum atomic ratio in whole crystal abbreviated as average silicon aluminum atoiic ratio . The aluminum distribution inside the crystal is able to be estimated by determining an adsorption desorption curve of pyridine, from which the solid acid strength distribution of whole crystal is determined. Because, both of the silicon aluminum arrangement with an bridged oxygen aton inside the crystal and the arrangement of silicon aluminu. atoms on the crystal surface relate to the strength disbribution of solid acid. Moreover, it is generally known that pyridinium ions or coordinated pyridine are formed by adsorbing pyridine on the solid acid sites, but this pyridine is desorbed as temperature is raised, and the desorption temperature and solid acid strength is intimately interrelated. In the present invention, pyridine is sufficiently adsorbed at 300 t by H hydrogen type TSZ III TSZ m will be defined later obtained by the ion exchange of crystalline aluminosilicate with ammonium chloride and or mineral acid and successive firing at about 500 C. Then H TSZ IlI is maintained in a nitrogen stream at 300t so that the physically adsorbed pyridine is removed off. Thereafter the temperature is raised at a predetermined rate to quantita tively determine the desorbed pyridine by gas chromatography or other ordinary methods of measurement, whereby the amount and the strength distribution of the solid acid are determined from the height, shape, or position of the peak obtained. The process for the preparation of crystalline sodium aluminosilicate of the present invention will now be described. The crystalline aluminosilicate of the present invention, having a characteristic distribution of silicon and aluminum atoms in its crystal hereinafter referred to as Tsz III , is usually prepared as follows An aqueous reaction mixture substantially consisting of inorganic reaction materials is prepared by using SiO2 as silicon source and A A 2 0 3 as aluminum source, within a certain range of ratio, and some appropriate alkali source and water. These components are mixed in predetermined range, then the reaction mixture is heated at a crystallization temperature until the crystals are formed. The composition of the aqueous reaction mixture for the preparation of the crystalline sodium aluminosilicate of the present invention is as follows SiO2 Al 2 0 3 1 0 1 0 0 Na2O SiO2 0.03 0.5 H2 O SiO2 1 0 3 0 0 C A SiO 2 0.1 1 0 still preferably SIO2 A A 2 0 3 2 0 8 0 Na 20, SiO2 0.0 5 0 3 0.3 H2 O SiO2 2 0 2 0 0 CA Si O 2 0.1 5 The preparation of this aqueous reaction mixture, and of the subsequent aqueous reaction gel mixture, are especially important for the preparation of TSZ m . Generally, there are no essential difference between the preparation of crystalline sodium aluminosilicate using in organic reaction materials as in the present invention and the preparation of crystalline sodium aluminosilicate using organic nitrogen cations instead of cations of a Group I or II metal. In either case, an aqueous reaction gel mixture can be obtained at the same time when the acidic solution of silicon and the alkaline solution of aluminum are mixed together. In another method, the prepared homogeneous solution of silicon and aluminum can be gelated with an acid or alkali. Further, the obtained gel can be converted into xerogel and then reconverted into aqueous reaction gel mixture. Among these various methods of gelation, the most preferred one for the preparation of TSZ m in which the distributions of silicon and aluminum in the crystal must be controlled is a method of preparing a homogeneous solution of silicon and aluminum compounds firstly and then gelating the solution. Any combination of compounds can be used so long as a homogeneous solution of silicon and aluminum is obtained. For example, active alumina, alumina, alumina trihydrate, sodium aluminate, and chloride, nitrate, and sulfate of aluiminum are used as alunminum source, and sodium silicate, silica gel, silicic acid, aqueous colloidal silica gel, dissolved silica, powdered silica, or amorphous silica as silica source.The most preferable sources are an aqueous sodium aluminate solution as aluminum compound source and aqueous solutions of various sodium silicates or colloidal silica as silica compound source, considering properties of the obtained crystals, economy, scale merit of industrialization, and so on. Thus, a homogeneous mixture of silicon and aluminum is obtained in the form of an alkaline solution, and an aqueous reaction gel mixture is obtained by neutralizing this alkaline solution with an acid solution. It is preferred to use a socalled mineral acid, more preferably hydrochloric, sulfuric, or nitric acid for the neutralization. Hydrochloric acid is the most desirable because sodium chloride, formed by the reaction with excess sodium hydroxide, serves as a mineralizer. The use of the mineralizer is desirable as will be described below for further improving the crystallizability to suppress the formation of amorphous sodium aluminosilicate. A solution of metal alkoxide can also be used to obtain a homogeneous solution of silicon and aluminum compounds. The alkoxide compounds of silicon include, for example, methyl orthosilicate tetramethyl orthosilicate , or ethyl orthosilicate tetraethyl orthosilicate . The typical alkoxide compounds of aluminum include aluminum isopropoxide. A homogeneous solution of silicon and aluminum compounds can be prepared easily by mixing the metal alkoxide solution.A homogeneous gel can be obtained easily by the hydrolysis of the obtained solution in the presence of an acid or an alkali. An aqueous reaction gel mixture can be also obtained from a glassy compound formed by moderate hydrolysis of above obtained homogeneous solution of silicon and aluminum compounds. In this case also, a mineralizer such as sodium chloride is effective for improving the crystallizability of the obtained crystalline sodium aluminosilicate. The following two mechanisms are assumed as a mechanism of forming crystalline aluminosilicate from an aqueous reaction gel mixture. The first mechanism include the depolymerization and dissolution of gels in hydrothermal reaction so that separately formed crystalline nuclei grow gradually. Since the crystalline nuclei are formed centering around a cation, it is assumed that the organic cation establishes a circumstance in which crystalline nuclei are easily formed according to its action as a template . Since the pH value of the solution is relatively higher in the presence of an organic cation than in the presence of an inorganic cation, the nuclei are considered to be formed with a cation serving as template immediately, after the formation of a hydrated silicate ion ll2 O Si OH 5 by the action of the organic cation. The action of the hydroxide ion is important in this depolymerization gels. It is considered that, in this mechanism, the deposition and subsequent crystallization of silicon compounds occur continuously around the nuclei which contain a relatively large amount of silicon in the presence of the organic cation. If these nuclei are assumed to grow infinitely, it is not unreasonable that, as has been suggested, crystalline silicate consisting of silicon alone exists.Actually, it is known that the molar ratio of silica alumina can not be reduced to 20 or less, while it is possible to control freely the molar ratio of silica alumina of the obtained crystalline aluminosilicate within the range from 20 to several thousands, when organic ion such as tetrapropyl ammonium salt is added in the reaCtion mixture. The second mechanism include the formation of an aluminosilicate framework without dissolution of the gel. In this case, it is also considered that the nuclei grow in the gel phase and re arrange from the gel phase into solid. In this case, of course, the silicon aluminum arrangement in the aqueous reaction gel mixture is considered to affect greatly the silicon aluminum arrangement of the obtained crystalline aluminosilicate. The assumption of the second formation mechanism is advantageously supported by the fact that, if the molar ratio of silica alumina in the aqueous reaction gel mixture is incresed to 100 or more with the purpose of elevating the molar ratio of silica alumina in the obtained crystalline sodium aluminosilicate, the rearrangement becomes difficult and silicon oxide crystals are formed. According to the second formation mechanism, it is understood that the arrangement of silicon alumina in the gel particles must be controlled in order to control that in the crystals. Anyway, distribution of silicon and aluminum in the gel particles existing in a gel mixture should be homogeneous because the aqueous reaction gel mixture is obtained from a homogeneous solution. This homogeneous distribution in the gel particles may influence also on crystallization, presumably bringing about good results in the homogeneous distribution of silicon and aluminum atoms in the formed crystal. After the preparation of aqueous reaction gel mixture in this way, the reaction mixture is maintained under the following conditions autogenous pressure, within the range of about 120 to about 230 c for about 10 to about 50 hours. In the crystallization process, the crystallizability can be further improved and the formation of amorphous aluminosilicate can be supressed by adding a mineralizer to the aqueous reaction gel mixture. Such mineralizers include neutral salts of alkali or alkaline earth metals, such asNa C A Na2 CO3 , Na2 SO4 , Na2 Se0 4, KC B , KBr, KF, BaC A or BaBr, among which Narc A is preferable.The amount of NaG A z to be added is from about 0.1 to about 10, still preferably from about 0.1 to about 5 expressed by the molar ratio of CA SiO2 The crystalline sodium aluminosilicate of the present invention TSZ m is obtained by separating the obtained crystalline aluminosilicate by filtration from the solution, washing it with water and drying it. The obtained crystals were confirmed to be a completely crystallized product by the examination of powder X ray diffraction. The obtained X ray diffraction pattern is remarkably characterized in that the diffraction line of 28 14.7 d 6.03 A is singlet and those of 28 23 d 3.86 A and 28 23.3 d 3.82 A are clearly split, which shows that the structure of crystalline aluminosilicate of the present invention is entirely different from that of known crystalline zeolite. As mentioned before, the arrangement of silicon and aluminum atoms on the crystal surface of the crystalline aluminosilicate of the present invention is measured by X ray photoelectron spectroscopy, while the distribution of silicon and aluminum atoms in whole crystal is determined by the adsorption desorption curve of pyridine, basing on the information that the aluminum atog distribution influence on the solid acid strength distribution. In the present invention, pyridine is sufficiently adsorbed at 300t by H hydrogen type TSZ lII obtained by the ion exchange of crystalline aluminosilicate with among ium chloride and or mineral acid and subsequent firing at about 500 t. Then the physically adsorbed pyridine is removed by maintaining it in a nitrogen stream at 300 t, and the temperature is raised at a predetermined rate to quantitatively determine the desorbed pyridine by gas chromatography or other ordinary methods of measurement. For example, when the quantitative determination was made with gas chromatograph of flame ionization detector, the peak indicates exactly the amount and distribution of the solid acid as illustrated in the examples.In this case, a sharp peak suggests the presence of solid acid sites having the similar acid strength, which indicates that the combination of silicon and aluminum bridged by an oxygen atom is comp aratively homogeneous. The presence of strong solid acid sites for example, those in which pyridine can not desorb until at around 900 t indicate that the arrangement of aluminum atoms are coarse locally. In order to use the crystalline sodium aliminosilicate of the present invention as catalyst or catalyst composition, the crystals are fired for dehydration at a temperature of about 200 t or above in an atmosphere of air or an inert gas. The dehydrated product is useful as catalyst or catalyst carrier for chemical reactions, and the cations in the product is preferred to be removed or replaced at least partly by heat treatment and or ion exchange. Particularly those exchanged by cations are excellent as catalyst for the conversion of hydrocarbons. Usually the ions to be exchanged can be selected according to the desired reaction. They can be exchanged with hydrogen ions by acid treatment, or by exchange with NH 4 followed by heat treatment.Hydrogen ions and ions of Group NL metals in periodical table are preferable for the decomposition, isomerization, alkylation, or other conversions of hydrocarbons. In the present invention, the cation exchange can be effected by contacting the crystal with a desired exchangeable cation or a cationic salt. A variety of neutral salts of Group NL or alkaline earth metals can be used for this purpose, among which chlorides, nitrates, fulfates, and acetates are preferable. When the TSZ III of the present invention is used as catalyst, it is preferred to introduce active metal components by ion exchange or to introduce hydrogen ion by acid treatment, as described above, for the improvement in catalytic activity. The TSZ 111 of the present invention can be used as a mixture with a carrier such as silica alumina or alumina as in an ordinary method.

Transition metals such as cobalt or nickel, or noble metals such as platinum or palladium can be incorporated in the TSZ Ill of the present invention by ion exchange or other methods, for the use of the TSZ III as catalyst for various catalytic reactions. For reactions such as catalytic dewaxing of gas oil or lubricating oil fractions and catalytic isomerizations of n paraffins, the reaction conditions are from about 250 to about 400 t in temperature, about 5 to about 50 W , preferably about 10 to about 30 I g d in pressure, and about 0.25 to about 3 V H V, preferably about 1.0 to about 2.0 V H V in liquid space velocity. For the use of TSZ III as catalyst for catalytic conversion of alcohols into hydrocarbons, the reaction conditions are from about 250 t to about 450 , but preferably from about 300 t to about 400 C, in temperature, from atmospheric pressure to about 50 kg cmêG, but preferably from atmospheric pressure to about 30 kg cmêG, in pressure, from about 0.1 to about 10 V H V, but preferably from about 0.5 to about 5 V H V, in liquid space velocity.

Example 5 The hydrogen type TSZ 111 and the hydrogen type ZSM 5 obtained in Example 4 and Comparative Example 5 were subjected to pyridine adsorption and heat desorption test.

These two solutions were simultaneously dropped into 480g of hot water heated at 70 to 80 C to prepare gel.The obtained gel was aged at 70 C for about 1 hour and filtered. The product was then washed with an aqueous solution of 1.5 by weight of ammonium carbonate until the Na2 0 content after firing at 600 C reached 50 ppm or less in terms of weight. The obtained gel was kneaded and molded so that the binder alunina content was 30 by weight.

Nitrogen was flown into the pyridine solution at a constant temperature of 15.5t at a flow velocity of 50 mB min.so that pyridine was adsorbed by the sample at 300 t to saturation. Then only dry nitrogen was flown at a maintained temperature of 300t to remove the physically adsorbed pyridine. The sample was then heated at a rate of lOt min and the desorbed pyridine was quantitatively determined by flame ionization detecting gas chromatography. The temperaturepyridine desorption relationships of the samples of Example 4 and Comparative Example 5 are shown in Figure 1.
