# IMPROVEMENTS IN HYDRAULIC CEMENTS

## Abstract
Alkaline residues in a hydraulic cement are neutralised by incorporating in the cement an acid material having a dissolution rate sufficiently slow that the setting process is not adversely affected. Typically the neutralising agent comprises an alkali metal phosphorus pentoxide glass which is incorporated in the cement prior to or after mixing with water. The pH of the glass is adjusted by controlling its phosphorus pentoxide content, and the dissolution rate is determined by including e.g. calcium oxide and or alumina to the glass composition.
