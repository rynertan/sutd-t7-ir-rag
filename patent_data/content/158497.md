## Description
The present invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for detecting biological activity. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for making rapid analysis of materials in which the presence of microorganisms or the like is suspected by infrared analysis of a sample of the head space gas of a container in a sample cell located externally from the container. When, for example, bacteria are cultured in a suitable medium including a carbon source, such as glucose, the carbon source is broken down to form CO₂ during the growth and metabolism of the bacteria. It would be desirable to provide a rapid, sensitive method for the analysis of the gaseous atmosphere produced over the growth medium in the head space in order to determine the presence or absence of biological activity. In many fields of endeavour it is important to be able to determine whether or not substances are contaminated with biologically active agents such as bacteria and the like. Examples of such fields are the medical field, the food processing industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the cosmetics industry and the field of public health. It has long been standard practice to place a sample of material to be tested for the presence of biologically active agents on a semisolid nutrient medium contained in a Petri dish and to make visual observations of the resulting microbial growth, if any. A similar procedure involves the inoculation of a sterile vial or bottle of liquid nutrient medium with the suspect material, again followed by visual detection of growth. Not only are such methods slow and laborious, but because they depend upon the subjective judgement of individual human observers, the result obtained is not uniformly reliable. Techniques have also been developed for the detection of bacteria which involve the incubation of a sample of material to be tested in a closed container with radioactive isotope labeled culture medium with subsequent monitoring of the atmosphere in the container above the medium to determine whether or not radioactive gases are produced. A system of this type is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,676,679 and 3,935,073. Such systems are rapid and reliable, but they suffer from a number of disadvantages resulting primarily from the use of radioactive materials. Radioisotope labeled materials are expensive and require special handling during storage, use and disposal. Moreover, although the levels of radioactivity encountered in using such systems are very low, prospective users may be deterred by personal fears of radioactivity. Systems have been described which do not require the use of radioactivity in any manner. U.S. Pat. No. 4,182,656 describes a method for the detection of biologically active agents based upon utilization of substrates enriched with stable Carbon 13. Although this method eliminates any requirement for radioisotopes in the detection system, nutrients enriched with Carbon 13 are less available and considerably more expensive than their radiolabled counterparts. Because ¹³CO₂ has molecular properties very nearly the same as ¹²CO₂, the most prevalent isotopic form of carbon dioxide, and because ¹³C comprises better than 1 of all carbon in the environment, special care must be taken to insure that ¹³C carbon dioxide is detected preferentially while ambient carbon dioxide is ignored. A mass spectrometer is generally used to detect changes in the relative abundance of stable isotopes, and was used in the development of the forementioned patent. Mass spectrometry requires relatively sophisticated high vacuum instrumentation, and is thus not a suitable detection means for application in the typical microbiology laboratory. U.S. Pat No. 4,073,691 discloses a non radiometric means for detection of biologically active agents through detection of any change in the character of the gas present over a liquid growth medium contained in a sealed vial system. Changes in the character of the gas are determined by measurement of the ratio of the selected product gas to an inert reference gas also present in the vial measurements made before and after the vial has been subjected to conditions conducive to bacterial growth. The inclusion of an inert reference gas for ratio measurement purposes requires that the detection system be responsive to CO₂ liberated as a consequence of metabolism as well as to the inert reference gas, complicating the instrumentation required for such measurement. The concentration of the inert gas present in the culture gas used with such a system must be known and reproducible from lot to lot of culture gas, further complicating the overall detection system. The use of radioisotopes or stable isotopes, or the use of inert reference materials has generally been considered necessary in order to provide for the detection of small quantities of gases produced by metabolism. Of the various gases produced by bacterial metabolism, carbon dioxide is the gas most commonly generated by the various families of bacteria, yeasts, and other primitive organisms. There thus exists a need for an instrumental system for measuring metabolically produced carbon dioxide to detect bacteria and the like which does not require isotopic enrichment or labelling of nutrients and does not depend upon addition of any reference inert gas to the culture vial. According to the invention there is provided a method for analyzing a sample for the presence of biological activity, said method comprising the steps of In the method of the invention a sealable sterile container, usually referred to herein as a vial , is provided containing a sterile, non isotopic culture medium. The medium contains a controlled concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide. The head space gas above the medium contains carbon dioxide in equilibrium with the culture medium. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the container head space and the concentration of carbon dioxide in the bottled gas provided for use with instrumental testing are substantially equal at a given medium pH and at the desired incubation temperature. The bottled gas provided for the various instrumental testing functions is referred to herein as culture gas . A sample of material to be tested for biological activity is introduced into the container and the container is sealed. The container is then subjected to conditions conductive to the occurrence of normal metabolic processes for a period of time sufficient to cause production of gaseous carbon dioxide by metabolism of various carbon sources in the medium if bacteria are present in the introduced sample. The vial head space gas is then withdrawn from the vial, circulated through the sample chamber of an infrared detection system to determine the concentration of carbon dioxide in the container head space. Any significant increase in the concentration of CO₂ in the container head space gas above the concentration of CO₂ present in the bottled culture gas is evidence of biological activity. While not so limited, the method of the invention is particularly applicable to the detection of medically significant bacteria. If the sample to be tested produces a background level of metabolic activity, such as the metabolic activity of fresh whole blood, the culture gas may be matched in CO₂ concentration to the vial head space gas achieved in the desired incubation temperature once the sample of blood or other material has been added. The presence in the sample of bacteria, yeasts, or the like will then be detected as an increase in the vial head space CO₂ concentration above this normal level, the latter being matched by the CO₂ concentration of the culture gas. The invention also provides apparatus for analyzing materials for the presence of biological activity by infrared absorbance, the apparatus comprising Thus, the apparatus of the invention includes a container adapted to receive a sample of material to be analyzed for biological activity together with a growth medium which includes various carbon sources capable of supporting normal metabolic processes, one result of which is the production of carbon dioxide. Also provided are means to sample the head space gas of said container. Also provided is means to measure the concentration of CO₂ present in a quantity of the gas via infrared analysis. The sampling means and the measurement means are intercommunicated by means of a pneumatic system. Pumping means are provided to circulate head space gas from the container through the CO₂ detection system and back to the container. Means to purge the gas handling system with bottled culture gas to remove any vestige of sample gas from the circulation and measurement systems and means to test the gas handling system to insure proper operation of the circulating pump, proper pressure of the culture gas supply, proper pneumatic conductance of the container gas sampling means, proper operation of the infrared detection system, and proper CO₂ content of the culture gas are also provided. The apparatus preferably provides means to rapidly and sequentially analyze a plurality of test containers, each containing an individual sample of material to be tested for biological activity. In one preferred form of the apparatus containers are firmly held in a rectangular array by means of a tray designed for the purpose. Means are provided to translate the head space gas sampling assembly over a row of containers along one dimension of the array. Additional means are provided to translate the tray along the dimension of the array perpendicular to the first so as to provide the gas sampling means access to each column of the tray. Container analysis is carried out sequentially for all vials in a row of a given column, followed by tray translation to present the next column for testing. Apparatus control and data processing means are provided via a microprocessor based system with program storage in read only memory ROM and data storage in random access memory RAM . Operator interface is provided by a standard computer terminal connected to the system using the RS 232C serial communications protocol. A similar RS 232C port is provided to communicate with an external data system. Instrument software provides the user with means to set instrument operating parameters, set detection criteria upon which to base positive results, log specimen containers onto the system, obtain a history of results for specimens under test, obtain a listing of new positive results, conduct a manual test of specimen containers exclusive of the automatic protocol, and conduct daily user maintenance of the system.

FIG. 33 is a graph of infrared detection response as a function of incubation time for the microorganism A detection apparatus embodying the principles and concepts of the invention is broadly depicted in FIG. 1. Containers 1 to be tested for biological activity are held and arranged in rectangular trays 2 placed in position on the test bed. Transparent hinged dust cover 3 protects containers under test from external contamination and provides an operator work surface. Test head assembly 4, located behind user access cover 5, traverses the Y axis of the tray, testing each container present in sequence for head space gas carbon dioxide content. Upon completion of each row of container tests, the tray is indexed under the test head to align the next column of containers for testing. The apparatus is microprocessor based, providing all operational control and user interface via CRT terminal 6. Test results and other information of operator interest is also available on an external printer not shown . The apparatus is particularly useful in providing early detection of the general presence of most medically significant bacteria in materials such as blood, urine, spinal fluid, synovial fluid, water samples and the like. The presence of such bacteria is readily detected by measuring the amount of CO₂ generated when a material to be analyzed is placed into a growth medium including a carbon source or sources which are metabolized to produce CO₂ and the medium with sample therein is thereafter incubated. A concentration of CO₂ in the sample of the head space removed from above the medium being significantly greater than present in the selected culture gas is an indication of the presence of microorganisms in the original sample of material. FIG. 2 presents the major parts of the apparatus in schematic form. A sample of material to be analyzed, such as blood or urine or the like, is placed into sterile culture container 1 fitted with a self sealing rubber septum and aluminium closure. Present in the container is suitable growth medium 2, buffered to maintain the desired pH and to produce the desired concentration of CO₂ in the head space 3 above the medium. The container is then incubated under conditions promoting biological activity. At suitable intervals, needle set 4 is driven down to penetrate the septum of a positioned vial with two hollow stainless steel pencil point needles 5, 6. The pneumatic system 10 including pump 11 recirculates the container head space gas up through needle 5, through submicron filter 7, through the measurement sample cell 12 of an infrared CO₂ analyzer 13, returning the gas to the vial via submicron filter 8 and needle 6. The resulting CO₂ reading is digitized and recorded by the data system controller 14. Results are presented by means of a CRT terminal 15 or printer 16 connected to the data system controller. Following each test, the needle set is withdrawn from the container, and aerobic or anaerobic culture gas from external sources 17 is used to purge the needle set, pneumatic system, and infrared sample cell 12 of head space gas left in the measurement system as a consequence of the test. Needle heater 9 is then brought to a position enclosing needles 5 and 6, heating them to a temperature sufficient to greatly diminish any chance that viable organisms lodged in or on either of the needles can be transferred to succeeding containers, resulting in cross contamination. Testing of multiple containers in automated fashion is facilitated through provision of a tray 18 fabricated to contain a multiplicity of containers in a rectangular array. Energizing and sensing components are provided to move the tray along the Y axis of the instrument test bed. Components 4 through 9 comprise the test head assembly 19, which includes sensing and motive components to translated the assembly as a unit along the X axis of the test bed. Because the head space gas CO₂ concentration present in a sterile vial at incubation temperature is controlled by chemical equilibrium established during medium formulation and container filling during manufacture, and because the external culture gas CO₂ concentration is chosen to be substantially equal to the equilibrium concentration of CO₂ present in the sterile container head space, correction for the head space CO₂ concentration may be achieved by subtracting the value measured for the culture gas. Containers incubated and tested which contain sterile material will thus have corrected CO₂ readings very nearly zero, while those containers exhibiting biological activity will have corrected readings greater than zero by a statistically significant amount. The corrected reading units, scaled to resemble readings obtained with a radiometric BACTEC instrument commercially available from Johnston Laboratories Division of Becton Dickinson and Company, Cockeysville, Maryland, have been termed Growth Value Units abbreviated GV . The pneumatic system of the apparatus is detailed schematically in FIG. 3. Culture gas from an external, pressure regulated source for the testing of containers of aerobic media is filtered by particulate filter F3 and is then supplied to the remainder of the system via electrically operated solenoid valve V3. Anaerobic culture gas for the testing of containers with anaerobic cultures is similarly supplied and filtered by F4 and controlled by solenoid valve V4. Pneumatic resistances R1 and R2 provide flow dependent pressure drops in each leg of the pneumatic circuit. Pressure transducers PT1 and PT2 are employed to sense operating pressures in each leg of the pneumatic circuit. Readings obtained during various portions of the operating cycle are used to insure proper operation of the apparatus and to provide adequate fault detection, should leaks, clogs, or pump failure occur. Solenoid valves V1 and V2 serve to isolate the head space gas sampling loop from the remainder of the system. Diaphragm pump P serves to circulate head space gas around the sampling loop during testing and to provide the requisite pressure differentials for system purging and performance testing. During a container test for head space CO₂ content, needles N1 and N2 pierce the elastomeric seal of culture container CC. Head space gas is drawn up through needle N1 through sterilizing droplet filter F1, then through the measurement cell SC of a non dispersive infrared analyzer by the action of pump P. Head space gas is returned to the container through assembly NH and serves to aid in the prevention of biological contamination of succeeding culture containers due to non sterile foreign materials collected in or on the sampling needles as a consequence of head space sampling of positive cultures, performance testing of measurement system function, or exposure of the needle assembly to ambient atmosphere during periods when the apparatus is idle. The pneumatic system, together with the non dispersive infrared carbon dioxide analyzer, comprise the measurement system of the apparatus. A suitable non dispersive infrared analyzer is the Series V CO₂ IR Analyzer Sensors, Inc., Saline MI 48175 . Suitable solenoid valves are provided by ITT General Controls Glendale, CA 91201 . Pressure transducers appropriate for the referenced pressure measurements may be obtained from MicroSwitch Division of the Honeywell Corporation Freeport, 1L 61032 . A diaphragm pump suitable for pneumatic system application consists of a pump head, model NO5 KNF Neuberger, Inc., Princeton, NJ 08540 coupled to a P N DB31D 12 motor Eastern Air Devices, Dover, NH 03820. Although the choice and arrangement of components comprising the measurement system described herein are suitable for the practice of the present invention, other components and arrangements may be used, as will occur to those skilled in the art. The complete testing of an array of sample containers for biological activity as taught by the method disclosed herein, including performance testing and needle heating, comprises one test cycle of the apparatus as accomplished by the measurement system and controlled by the data system. The complete test cycle is comprised of a preflush subcycle, instituted for each array of containers to be tested, and a container test subcycle, activated to test each container in the array individually. Because the specifics of the apparatus test cycle are to a large extent dependent upon the choice of measurement system components and the configuration of the apparatus control software, the following discussion of test cycle function is provided as an example of the various apparatus functions required for practice of the method as implemented using a prototype version of the disclosed apparatus. Various operational performance tests of the pneumatic system and IR analyzer are conducted during the test cycle activity under the direction of the data system controller. The ability to test all pertinent components of the measurement system is in a large part responsible for the relative complexity of the pneumatic system beyond those components enclosed within the head space gas sampling loop N1, F1, SC, P, F2, N2 in FIG. 3 . The preflush subcycle is best understood with reference to the timing diagram presented in FIG. 4 in conjunction with the pneumatic system diagram of FIG. 3. Upon initiation of the test cycle, the preflush subcycle begins with the test head and associated needle assembly raised, and hence exposed to the ambient, room air atmosphere. All solenoid valves are closed. It is assumed that aerobic containers are to be tested, hence culture gas will be supplied via V3 when needed. Pump P is energized briefly, so as to fill the sample cell SC of the IR analyzer with room air by flow through the needles N1 and N2. The needle heater NH is also energized at this time, in order to preheat the heater assembly for subsequent tests and to prevent biological contamination of the system from materials possibly deposited on the exposed needles. The analyzer is provided a brief period to stabilize, during which time the needle heater is extended to surround the needle assembly. At the completion of the stabilization period, the analyzer output is read, and compared with ambient air high and low CO₂ values stored in the data system. Normal output permits testing to continue an abnormal value aborts the test and issues a message for the operator to check the zero adjust of the IR analyzer. Valve V3 is opened briefly at this time, and pressure transducers PT1 and PT2 are read and compared to stored parameters to ensure the presence of culture gas at the appropriate supply pressure as well as to test for proper pressure transducer function. The difference in transducer output is compared to a stored constant, and a warning message issued to service the pressure transducers if the stored value is exceeded. The output of PT1 is then compared to a second pair of constants for high and low limit, and high and low culture gas pressure warning messages are issued if the output does not fall between limits. Testing is discontinued in either case. V3 is then closed to conserve culture gas while needle heating continues for a period sufficient to raise the needle block temperature to the desired value. Needle heating is then discontinued, retraction of the heater assembly begun, pump P is started, and valves V1, V2, and V3 are opened to permit culture gas flow through the pneumatic system, filling the IR sample cell SC and the pump, P1 with culture gas. Several seconds of gas circulation are provided to insure that the system has been purged and filled with culture gas. The transducers PT1 and PT2 are then read and the difference of their respective readings taken and compared with a previously stored limit to ensure proper pump operation. A normal difference permits testing to continue an abnormal difference aborts testing and causes a warning message to be issued to check the pump and connecting tubing. Pump P is then stopped, followed by the closing of valves V1, V2 and V3. The IR analyzer is permitted time to stablize. The output of the IR analyzer is then read, the previously stored reading for ambient air subtracted, and the result compared to normal limit values for the selected culture gas. A normal result between limit values permits testing to continue an abnormal result aborts testing and causes a warning message to be issued to check for either high or low CO₂ content of the culture gas and to check the measurement system. The reading of culture gas CO₂ content is also stored by the data system, and is used to correct measured head space gas vial test readings as taught by the disclosed method. Pump P and valves V1 and V3 are then energized with V2 closed, permitting culture gas to exit from needles N1 and N2. Transducer PT2 is then read and compared to previously stored high and low limits to ensure that the culture gas pressure is neither too high nor too low. Abnormal test values cause the test to be aborted and warning messages to be issued to check the external culture gas source pressure, either high or low. The pump is then stopped, preventing further communication between the two legs of the system, and valve V2 is opened. With V1, V2 and V3 now open, culture gas flows through each leg of the pneumatic system, exiting needles N1 and N2. Tranducers PT1 and PT2 are again read and individually compared with stored values to ensure that the pressure drop across each needle and filter is within acceptable limits. Test failure causes further testing to be discontinued, with issuance of a warning message to check needles and filters for obstructions high pressure or to check all tubing connections low pressure . Valves V1, V2 and V3 are then closed, completing the preflush subcycle. The container test subcycle follows the preflush subcycle, and is repeated for each container to be tested. Apparatus timing during the test subcycle is presented in FIG. 5, referenced to the pneumatic system shown in FIG 3. The subcycle is entered with all valves closed and the needle heater deenerigized. The measurement system which includes the needles N1 and N2, the sample chamber SC and the connective piping contains pure culture gas as a consequence of preflush activity. Tray and test head motion are activated to bring the first container to be tested under the test head, as previously shown schematically in FIG 2. Correct vial position is determined by various optical sensors not shown under data system control. Proper X, Y, positioning defines zero time for the test subcycle. The previously selected culture gas source is used for either aerobic or anaerobic testing and compared against the encoded container tray to assure that the appropriate culture gas has been selected. Agreement permits testing to continue, while a mismatch aborts testing and issues a warning for culture gas selection. Valve V3 is energized to admit culture gas to the system, and transducers PT1 and PT2 are read and the difference of their readings taken. A differential reading which exceeds the previously stored limit causes the issuance of a warning message to service the pressure transducers, while a reading from PT1 outside prescribed high and low limit values causes messages to be issued to check for either high or low culture gas pressure. Valve V3 is then closed. The test head assembly is then driven downward, causing needles N1 and N2 to penetrate the elastomeric container seal, gaining access to the container head space. Pump P is then energized, transferring head space gas to the sampling loop of the pueumatic system. The closed loop nature of head space gas circulation causes the head space gas to be diluted with culture gas by an amount dependent upon the relative volumes of the container head space and the sampling loop, in turn causing the measured CO₂ content to be different from the CO₂ concentration present in the head space prior to sampling. This inavoidable dilution must be minimized in order to preserve the efficacy of the test method. Ideally, the sampling loop volume is miniscule compared to the container head space gas upon circulation through the sampling loop. Practical considerations dictate that the obtainable minimum dilution is approproximately 50 percent, a value obtained only through careful minimization of connection tubing lengths within the pneumatic system, choice of pump and solenoid valves for minimum dead volume, and the like. In order to minimize measurement offset and to maximise test sensitivity for increases in head space CO₂ concentration due to biological activity, it is an important consideration of the present invention that the CO₂ concentration of the external culture gas be substantially equal to the head space CO₂ concentration of a sterile vial at incubation temperature prior to introduction of a sample to be tested. This consideration is important to the practice of the method disclosed herein. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the culture gas is selected to be substantially the same as the concentration of carbon dioxide in the head space gas of the sealed vial prior to introduction and incubation of the sample. In general the anaerobic culture gas will have from about 1 to about 10 percent carbon dioxide, from about 0 to about 10 percent hydrogen and the balance nitrogen. In general, the aerobic culture gas will have from about 1 to about 10 carbon dioxide and the balance air. The concentration of CO₂ in the head space of a sterile vial is a function of the conditions under which the growth medium is added to the vial and the composition and amount of the growth medium. In one preferred form of the invention, the CO₂ concentration of the head space gas for a 60 ml vial filled with 30 ml of an anaerobic culture medium will be from about 3 to about 5 percent. All percentages expressed herein are volume percent unless specifically indicated otherwise. The same vial filled with 30 ml of an aerobic culture medium will have a CO₂ concentration in the head space gas of from about 2 to about 3 percent. The needle heater assembly NH is energized and the pump is run for a period of time sufficient to insure complete mixing of the culture gas and head space gas within the sampling loop and culture container. The pump is then shut off, and the IR analyzer permitted to stabilize while the test head is raised, removing the needles from the culture container. The IR analyzer output is then read, processed by the data system, and stored. Valves V1, V2 and V3 are then opened to purge the head space gas sample from the sample loop. Valves V1, V2 and V3 are closed while the previously energized needle heater assembly NH is then brought into position around the needles, and the pump started to circulate room air through the sampling loop. The pump is then deenergized for a brief period while needle heating continues to aid in the elimination of any biologically active matter present in or on the needles. Shortly before needle heating is discontinued, the pump is again activated, followed by the opening of V1 and V3. Pressure transducer PT2 is then read and compared to previously stored limited values to ensure proper culture gas pressure. Testing continues with a normal reading an abnormal value above or below the set limits aborts testing and causes warning messages to be issued to check for high or low culture gas pressure, as applicable. Valve V2 is then opened while V1 and V3 remain open and the pump continues to run. Culture gas is permitted to exit from needles N1 and N2. Transducers PT1 and PT2 are again read, and their pressure difference compared to a stored value. A test value lower than the stored constant causes testing to cease and a warning message to be issued to check the pump and associated tubing. The pressure readings of PT1 and PT2 are checked and the values compared to previously stored readings to ensure that the tubing connections are secure and that the needles and filters are free of obstructions. Abnormal values cause the test to be aborted and a warning message to be issued to check tubing connections in the case of low pressure, or to check for obstructions in the case of high pressure recorded by either transducer. V2 is then opened and the pump shut off, admitting culture gas to both legs of the pneumatic system. PT1 and PT2 are again read, and their readings compared to stored values to ensure that the pressure drop across each needle and its associated filter is within acceptable limits. Abnormal results cause the container test to be discontinued with the issuance of a warning message to check all tubing connections for low pressure sensed by either transducer, or to check needles and filters for obstructions for high pressure result. All valves are then closed, and the sample changer energized to bring the test head and or tray into position for the testing of the next container in sequence, whereupon the container test subcycle begins again. Control of the measurement system, tray motion, and test head motion and function are accomplished by the data system controller in conjunction with the associated electronics as shown schematically in FIG. 6. Mains power is conditioned by filter 1 to satisfy domestic and foreign radio frequency interference specifications. Filtered 120V AC power is distributed to the main power supply 2, to the AC driver circuitry 3, and to the needle heater power supply 4. Filtered 120V AC power is also furnished to a convenient outlet to provide power to the external CRT terminal and printer. Logic level signals from the data system controller 5 actuate the AC requiring motors, solenoid valves and the like associated with the measurement system 6, the tray motion assembly 7, and the test head 8 through solid state switches on the AC driver board. The needle heater power supply is operated in a constant power mode in order to prevent decay in the efficiency of needle heating as the heating elements increase in resistance due to aging. On off control of the heater is provided by the controller, which also monitors an error signal generated by the heater power supply to insure proper operation of the heater. The sequencing of solenoid valves and the cycling of the sampling pump are similarly directed by the controller, which also accepts the analog readings from the pressure transducers and IR analyzer as previously described. All analog signals are processed by a multiplexed 10 bit analog to digital converter prior to signal processing. Tray motion is similarly controlled through optical sensors which determine tray indexing locations and tray code verfication to insure that the aerobic or anaerobic culture gas selected is correct for the tray inserted for test. An ultraviolet lamp used for vial cap irradiation is also processor controlled, and is cycled on only when a tray test is in progress with the appropriate access covers closed to protect the operator from undue UV exposure. IR analyzer raw data, proportional to infrared transmittance in the region of CO₂ absorbance is delivered to the data system controller in analog form, digitized, and then linearized to reflect carbon dioxide concentration by means of a look up table resident in the system software. The linearized data is then scaled to provide a reasonable range of numerical values for operator perusal within the range of 0 to 200 300 arbitrary units, termed Growth Values GV . The maximum value of the scaled data depends upon whether aerobic or anaerobic culture gas is in use, and upon the proportion of the IR analzyer dynamic range consumed by the presence of CO₂ in the culture gas. Thus a lower maximum growth value is evidenced when testing anaerobic cultures, owing to the increased CO₂ concentration present in the anaerobic culture gas. All operating system software is stored in read only memory ROM , while system scratch pad memory and data storage occupy random access memory RAM . Operation of the system is interrupt driven in conjunction with a real time clock to control sample test protocol timing and testing. Critical data and system memory contents and real time clock function are maintained for power outages of at least one week in duration by means of nickel cadmium battery backup. Power fail restart circuitry is provided to insure an orderly shutdown of the apparatus upon power failure. Critical system and processor constants are stored upon power failure detection, and are used to restart the system when mains power is returned. All user interaction with the apparatus is by means of the external CRT terminal via menu driven screen presentations. Individual menu screens are provided for display selection, the setting of operational parameters, the choice of positive vial detection criteria, the logging of a specimen container onto the system, the obtaining of an aerobic anaerobic vial pair history in terms of historically measured growth values, the reporting of cultures detected as positive since the previous instrument reading, the performance of a manual test of a tray of culture containers and the performance of daily apparatus maintenance. In order to insure that the apparatus meets operational specifications in clinical application, self test provisions are also included in the operating software, including automatic self test routines to check ROM, RAM, the central processor CPU , power supply voltage levels, and standby battery condition. These routines are executed while the apparatus is idling between container tests. Operational checks of system operation are also performed on the optical sensors, motors, the needle heater power supply needle heater, and the measurement system. Daily readiness procedures are also provided to be executed as part of the daily user maintenance protocol which perform detailed checks of the controller, the measurement system, the power supplies, the optical sensors and the various motors. The previously mentioned user maintenance procedures provide fault isolation to the subassembly level of the apparatus. The growth media utilized in conjunction with the apparatus previously described for the practice of the disclosed method are formulated to characteristics suitable for the growth and detection of aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic microorganisms. It is well understood that oxygen must be provided for the cultivation of strictly aerobic microorganisms, and must be completely minimized, should the cultivation of strict anaerobes be desired. If photoresponsive or phototoxic microorganisms are of interest, light should be provided or excluded accordingly. Typical culture media generally contain water, a carbon source and a nitrogen source. The carbon source may be a carbohydrate, amino acid, mono or dicarboxylic acid or salt thereof, polyhydroxy alcohol, hydroxy acid, carbon dioxide bicarbonate, or other metabolizable carbon or carbon dioxide compound. Some microorganisms assimilate carbon dioxide drring growth. Some of these microorganisms require relatively high concentrations of carbon dioxide in the medium due to low affinity of the microorganism for carbon dioxide. Usually the carbon source will comprise at least one sugar such as glucose, sucrose, fructose, xylose, maltose, lactose, etc. Amino acids such as lysine, glycine, alanine, tyrosine, threonine, histidine, leucine, etc, also frequently comprise part of the culture medium carbon source. The nitrogen source may be nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, urea or any other assimilable organic or inorganic nitrogen source. An amino acid or mixture thereof might serve as both a carbon and a nitrogen source. Sufficient nitrogen should be present to facilitate cell growth and replication. A variety of calcium, potassium and magnesium salts may be employed in the culture medium, including chlorides, sulfates, phosphates and the like. Similarly, phosphate and sulfate ions can be supplied as a variety of salts. As such materials are conventional in microbiological growth media, the selection of specific materials as well as their proportions is within the skill of the art. The so called minor elements which are present in trace amounts commonly include manganese, iron, zinc, cobalt and possibly others. Examples of well known culture media which may be used in the present invention are peptone broth, tryptic soy broth, nutrient broth, thioglycolate broth and brain heart infusion broth. Tryptic soy broth based media 6B and 7C Media, for aerobic and anaerobic culturing respectively are commercially available from Johnston Laboratories, BBL Microbiology Systems Division of Becton Dickinson, Towson, MD 21204 have been found to work well. It is well understood that most biologically active species cannot function in strongly acidic or strongly alkaline media. Similarly, in order for the disclosed method and apparatus to function effectively to detect carbon dioxide produced as a consequence of microorganism metabolism as expressed by an increase in the CO₂ content of the culture container head space gas, it is preferable that the pH of the medium be buffered and carefully controlled in order to insure that the proper carbon dioxide bicarbonate equilibrium is established and maintained in the growth medium prior to inoculation with the suspect samples. Values of pH higher than optimum result in poor release of CO₂ from the liquid medium, while media pH values lower than optimum cause excessive CO₂ to be present in the head space gas, masking the metabolically produced carbon dioxide. Suitable buffers, such as potassium or ammonium phosphates, sodium citrate, or the like may be employed for purposes of pH adjustment, while various carbonate and bicarbonate salts, as well as gaseous CO₂ added to the head space during manufacture of the filled culture vial may be employed to establish the chemical equilibrium most advantageous for detection. Because many species of bacteria, most notably among the anaerobes, require a significant concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide in the culture medium for optimum growth, the aforemention attention to both pH adjustment and carbon dioxide equilibration act to synergistically enhance both growth and detection. It should be understood that not all microorganisms metabolize carbohydrate and or amino acid substrates present in the growth medium to produce carbon dioxide in sufficient quantities for detection by the present method. Such is particularly the case for certain anaerobic microorganisms, most notably among the The present method achieves detection of these microorganisms via detection of the drop in growth medium pH which occurs as a consequence of acid production as indirectly measured by an increase in the container head space CO₂ content due to the concurrent shift in the carbonic acid bicarbonate equilibrium which necessarily accompanies the change in pH. Such indirect detection of metabolism enables detection of growth of a wide range of microorganisms and metabolic patterns through metabolic production of carbon dioxide in the head space gas. Thus, a fundamental contribution of the medium to the method and apparatus of the invention derives from a carefully chosen bicarbonate concentration which both promotes the growth of those organisms with a nutritional requirement for it and permits detection of acid producing organisms that produce little or no metabolic carbon dioxide. With any suitable buffering system this added bicarbonate raises the concentration of carbon dioxide in the head space, requiring a corresponding increase in the carbon dioxide concentration in the culture gas. As these concentrations increase, sensitivity of detection of metabolically produced carbon dioxide is reduced. Two causes contribute to the reduction of sensitivity. At higher concentrations of CO₂ bicarbonate in the medium, the difference between the concentration of carbon dioxide in the culture gas and the intial head space concentration of carbon dioxide tends to have a higher absolute value. A maximum difference of up to twenty percent carbon dioxide present may exist between the culture gas and the head space gas. For use with these higher concentrations, the carbon dioxide analyzer must have a greater full scale range and will therefore tend to have errors corresponding to a greater absolute error in carbon dioxide concentration. For the desired spectrum of organisms the optimal concentration of bicarbonate in the growth medium is therefore the minimum concentration which competently supports their growth and yields detection of the acid producers. When these choices are made as set forth for the preferred embodiment of this invention, all pathogenic bacteria ordinarily found in blood culture can be rapidly detected, yet the time to detection is not greatly increased for those bacteria which could be detected with much less or no bicarbonate in the growth medium. In general, a medium suitable for providing assimable carbon dioxide as well as provide sufficient carbon dioxide for detection of acid producing microorganisms contains an effective amount of a precursor for carbon dioxide which can produce carbon dioxide by the metabolism of a microorganism present in a sample of material. The precursor is activated by the generation of acid during metabolism of acid producing microorganisms. The precursor is present at a level of from about 0.5 mM to about 20.0 mM of equivalent bicarbonate per liter of medium preferably from about 1.0 mM to about 10.0 mM of equivalent bicarbonate per liter of medium. Suitable precursors include sodium bicarbonate, dissolved carbon dioxide, sodium carbonate, and other bicarbonate salts. At the outset of the process, the growth medium is inoculated with a sample of material to be tested while the pH of the medium is maintained between about 6.5 and 8.0 and desirably from about 7.2 to 7.5. The head space gas CO₂ concentration is between about 2.0 and 3.0 percent for an aerobic medium, and between about 3.0 and 5.0 percent for an anaerobic medium, subject to the constraints of chemical equilibrium, volume and temperature previously discussed. The amount of sample employed may vary widely, but preferably should be from about 1.0 to 20.0 percent of the growth medium by volume. After a short delay, any viable microorganisms present in the culture medium will grow and replicate, followed by a decrease in growth rate. In addition, the rate of evolution of CO₂ will vary depending upon such factors as nutrient composition, pH, temperature, proportion of inoculum, and type of microorganism present. For effective metabolism for the majority of bacteria, the temperature of the medium with the sample therein is preferably maintained between about 35 C and about 37 C. Some microorganisms achieve optimum growth at temperatures of 20 C or lower, while others may exhibit optimum growth at 45 C or higher. This invention may employ any temperature best suited to a given circumstance, provided attention is paid to the concentration of CO₂ present in the head space gas of containers held at the desired temperature, and the CO₂ concentration of the associated culture gas adjusted to match the head space gas concentration as closely as is practical. Although satisfactory microorganism growth may usually be achieved without agitation of the inoculated culture containers, metabolism is preferably carried out with active shaking, stirring, or the like, effective to insure proper evolution of CO₂ from the medium. In one preferred embodiment, external agitation is provided by rotary shaking means to introduce a vortex into the liquid medium. Turning now more particularly to the practice of the method conducted with the equipment depicted in FIG. 1, the culture containers 1 preferably will have a total capacity of between 30 ml and 150 ml of which 2 ml 100 ml will be occupied by the culture medium and test sample. The volume of blood or urine or other sample may be, for example, 0.1 ml to 10.0 ml. In one preferred embodiment, the culture containers have an overflow volume of approximately 60 ml, and receive 30 ml growth medium and can receive 3 5 ml sample. The head space gas thus occupies about 50 of the total container volume. It is preferred that the container head space comprise between about 30 to about 60 percent of the total container volume. It is somewhat more important that the ratio of the container head space volume to the volume of the measurement system be maintained as large as possible in the light of the foregoing considerations in order to maintain the detection sensitivity of the system. In order to determine the feasibility of using the apparatus and method herein disclosed to detect the presence of biological activity in simulated blood cultures through analysis of the culture container head space gas, a research prototype instrument was fabricated having the essential features of the apparatus shown in FIG. 1. The pneumatic system employed was essentially equivalent to that described in FIG. 12. A commercially available IR analyzer Model AR500R Infrared Gas Analyzer, Anarad, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA 93105 was employed for CO₂ detection, while container testing was accomplished by means of a modified commercially available Model 225 BACTEC instrument Johnston Laboratories . The system was controlled by a Cromemco System Three microcomputer Cromemco, Inc., Mountain View, CA 94040 . Instrument function and test sequencing were essentially equivalent to previous descriptions given herein. In order to simulate the low inoculum levels found in clinical blood cultures, and still achieve statistically significant results, the inocula in the simulated blood culturing experiments were prepared at approximately 100 colony forming units CFU per container. Organisms for testing were taken from overnight cultures from either agar or broth media. For standardization purposes, several colonies from an agar plate were suspended in 5.0ml of thioglycollate broth for anaerobes, or tryptic soy broth for aerobes both from BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, MD 21030 in a 16 x 125mm screw cap tube, and turbidity adjusted to between 57 and 63 percent transmittance in a Spectronic 88 spectrophotometer Bausch and Lomb, Rochester, NY 14625 set to 600 nm wavelength. Alternatively, approximately 0.7ml of turbid broth from a BACTEC Vial Johnston Laboratories was dispensed into 5.0ml of broth and turbidity adjusted as above. The standardized broth was three time diluted 1 100 in like broth, and 0.5ml of the final dilution approximately 100 CFU was added to each vial to be tested on the breadboard instrument. Inoculum levels were verified by plate count. Blood for kinetic growth studies was obtained from Community Blood and Plasma Service Baltimore, MD 21231 . This blood, sometimes referred to herein as banked blood , was drawn on order into specially prepared bags containing Sodium Polyanethol Sulfonate SPS as anticoagulant in a final concentration of 0.05 . Kinetic studies with All growth media used in the following examples were from Johnston Laboratories. All anaerobic microorganisms were grown in 7C BACTEC anaerobic medium, flushed but not shaken during testing with anerobic culture gas. This gas consisted of 2 carbon dioxide, 5 hydrogen, and the balance nitrogen. Aerobic microorganisms were grown in 6BM medium 6B medium with stirring magnets added and were magnetically stirred on the prototype instrument. Aerobic culture gas consisted of 2.5 carbon dioxide, with the balance air. Incubation temperature for all experiments was controlled between 35 C and 37 C. Five slow growing, fastidious microorganisms were tested in blood supplemented media. Containers were inoculated for each microorganisms broth combination, with each vial containing fresh whole blood from a different individual. Inocula ranged from 8 to 150 CFU container. Control containers were prepared using fresh whole blood less the microorganism inoculum. Control container results were summed to derive mean and standard deviation data. Containers were tested following inoculation and once per day thereafter. Detection thresholds were chosen to be 19 GV for aerobic cultures and 34 GV for anaerobic cultures based upon experiments to determine worst case blood metabolism backgrounds. FIG. 7 present Growth Values determined as a function of test time for the microorganism Fastidious anerobic microorganisms were similarly tested. Results obtained with Kinetic growth investigations were carried out for a set of clinically significant microorganisms, running paired container sets on the prototype IR instrument and on a similar, unmodified BACTEC Model 225 radiometric instrument. Experimental parameters for the kinetic studies are listed in Table 1. Banked blood with 0.05 SPS was used for all microorganism tests except Kinetic data recorded comparing IR detection with radiometric detection for the microorganism Organisms cultured anaerobically were also studied for detection kinetics. The microorganism Results of the kinetic studies are presented in Table 2. On the basis of the matched vial pair kinetic investigations, infrared detection is shown to provide essentially equivalent detection of the selected potentially pathogenic microorganism studied. Further analysis of the kinetic data on the basis of individual container results for each microorganism, rather than on the average result, proved detection times obtained with the disclosed infrared methodology to be equal to or better than those obtained with the conventional radiometric system in 72 of the tests. Approximately 93 of the tests detected within one test interval of BACTEC or better. Test intervals varied from two hours between tests for rapidly growing microorganisms to five hours for slow growers. The kinetic data is expressed in terms of detection test intervals in FIG. 27. In order to demostrate the detection sensitivity advantage gained by matching the carbon dioxide concentration of the apparatus culture gas to the concentration of CO₂ present in the head space gas of sterile, uninoculated containers maintained at the desired incubation temperature, a series of experiments were conducted with the microorganism Results obtained with the culture gas containing no carbon dioxide are shown in FIG. 28. Because readings are recorded as the difference between the CO₂ concentration in the container head space gas and the like concentration present in the culture gas, a positive offset is observed for all readings, necessarily adding to the detection threshold and reducing test sensitivity. When the culture gas CO₂ concentration is matching to the head space gas concentration, baseline control values are no longer elevated, and optimum detection is achieved, as presented in FIG 29. Results obtained with the 5 CO₂ mixture are given in FIG. 30. The large negative offset present initially would preclude the detection of rapidly growing microorganisms. Additionally, approximately 15 hours of incubation and associated repeated testing are required in order for the head space gas CO₂ concentration to achieve equilibrium with the culture gas CO₂ concentration. The decrease in the growth value difference achieved between the sample and control containers is clearly observed. FIG 31 depicts results obtained when the culture gas contains 10 carbon dioxide. The initial negative offset is now greatly increased, and detection sensitivity greatly decreased. In addition, approximately 36 test hours and multiple repeat tests are required in order for the head space CO₂ concentration to reach equilibrium with the culture gas. For proper functioning of the method herein disclosed, it is preferred that the carbon dioxide concentration of the apparatus culture gas be matched as closely as possible to the head space gas CO₂ content of sterile, uninoculated containers to be used in conjunction with the apparatus. This optimum situation provides optimum detection, and minimizes the time required for the culture container head space gas to reach equilibrium with the apparatus culture gas. Baseline readings remain stable throughout the incubation interval, permitting a detection threshold to be chosen which is time independent. It is well known that some clinically significant microorganisms, most notably among the anerobes, produce little carbon dioxide as a consequence of a substrate metabolism. The majority of these microorganisms do, however, produce considerable quantities of volatile and non volatile organic acids which are expressed into the medium, tending to lower medium pH. Experiments were thus conducted to determine if the carbon dioxide bicarbonate chemical equilibrium could be exploited to provide detection of these microorganisms via carbon dioxide released from the growth medium as the chemical equilibrium is shifted due to a lowered medium pH. Indirect liberation of CO₂ was first tested in 7C medium with 16.6mM sodium bicarbonate added. Test vials containing medium plus bicarbonate, and a control vials containing only medium were both subjected to 0.1ml incremental additions of 0.5M HCL. One vial pair received 0.1ml acid, the next 0.2ml, and so forth. Similar vial pairs were prepared for pH measurement. Vial pairs were read on the breadboard instrument, and the liberated CO₂ plotted as a function of acid addition as shown in FIG. 32. Detection of the chemically released carbon dioxide is clearly shown through comprision of the test and control vial Growth Value readings. The increase in initial CO₂ head space contration is far outweighed by the response evidenced as the pH is lowered. The indirect detection system was then tested with a strain of the microorganism
