# Device responsive to fluid leakage flows within a range from above a predetermined minimum to below a predetermined maximum and nonresponsive to fluid flows beyond said range.

## Abstract
A flow sensor is provided responsive to fluid leakage flows within a range from above a predetermined mini mum to below a predetermined maximum, to indicate that leakage flow is within that range and or that maxi mum leakage flow has been exceeded, but nonresponsive to fluid flows below the predetermined minimum or above the predetermined maximum, to avoid giving a false indication of fluid leakage flow, comprising a flow res ponsive valve 10 and a differential pressure indicator 45 sensing differential pressure between fluid leakage flow and normal fluid flow at the valve 10 .
