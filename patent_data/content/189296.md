## Description
A SEMICONDUCTOR LASER DEVICE This invention relates to a semiconductor laser device. In recent years, a window V channeled substrate inner stripe VSIS laser having window structure has been proposed as a semiconductor laser device which can achieve high output power operation A.P.L., vol. 42, p. 402, 19831. In such a VSIS window laser, the provision of a window region in the vicinity of the facets decreases light absorbance in this vicinity and prevents deterioration of the facets. Such provision also raises the output power at which breakdown of the facets occurs The VSIS window laser is produced as follows As shown in Figure 3 a , on a p GaAs substrate 10, an n GaAs current blocking layer 11 is grown, followed by an etching treatment to form a trapezoid channel S for the oscillation region and aV shaped channel T for each of the window regions.Then, as shown in Figure 3 b , pn the current blocking layer 11 including the channels S and T, a p GaAlAs cladding layer 12, a GaAlAs active layer 13, an n GaAlAs cladding layer 14, and an n GaAs cap layer 15 are successively grown. Figure 3 c and 3 d show sectional views of lines A A and B B in Figure 3 b .The con caved portion of the active layer 1 3 shown in section in Figure 3 d is the oscillation region L3. The plane portion of active layer 1 3 shown in section in Figure 3 c is the window region L1, which has an optical waveguide therein. A semiconductor laser device with the abovementioned structure has an optical waveguide within the window region L1 that has small light absorbance, so that the beam waists are positioned at the facets, thereby allowing for the prevention of deterioration of the facets, and moreover attaining a raise in the output power at which breakdown of the facets occurs.When the width of the optical waveguide in the window region L1 is selected to be about 4 pm, gain in the high order transverse mode is suppressed and oscillation in the fundamental transverse mode is achieved. However, in the semiconductor laser device with the structure described above, there are times when the controllability of the high order transverse mode is not sufficient, depending upon the conditions of growth and etching. For greater reliability in the control of the high order transverse mode, the width of channel T of the window region L1 can be narrowed, but if that is done, the cavity length of the window region L1 is correspondingly lengthened, and the differential quantum efficiency decreases due to light absorption to the substrate. Moreover, drastic shortening of the length of the window region L1 is difficult in light of the subsequent separation process of device units from each other. According to the present invention there is provided a semiconductor laser device comprising a a high order mode absorption region between the oscillation region including a concaved portion of the active layer and each of the window regions including a plane portion of the active layer, said high order mode absorption region having an optical waveguide the width of which is smaller than that of the optical waveguide in said window region. preferred embodiment ot the the invention described herein makes possible the objects of 1 providing a semiconductor laser device in which gain in the high order transverse mode is suppressed and stabilized oscillation in the fundamental transverse mode is attained up to a high output power, without the narrowing of the width of the channel in each of the window regions and 2 providing a semiconductor laser device in which a highorder mode absorption region having a channel width which is smaller than that of the window region, is disposed between the oscillation region including the concaved portion of the active layer and the window region including the plane portion of the active layer, so that gain in the high order transverse mode can be suppressed, and in which the length of the high ordermode absorption region can be reduced sufficiently by the use of a mask pattern, so that the decrease in the differential quantum efficiency can be suppressed. This invention may be better understood and its numerous advantages will become apparent to those skilled in the art by reference to the accompanying drawings as follows Figure 1 a is a perspective view showing the unfinished product of a semiconductor laser device according to this invention. Figure 1 b is a plane view of the unfinished product shown in Figure 1 a . Figure 2 is a perspective view showing a semiconductor laser device produced using the unfinished product shown in Figure 1 a . Figure 3 a is a perspective view showing the unfinished product of a conventional semiconductor laser device. Figure 3 b is a plane view showing a conventional semiconductor laser device produced using the unfinished product shown in Figure 3 a . Figures 3 c and 3 d , respectively, are sectional views showing one of the window regions and the oscillation region of the semiconductor laser device shown in Figure 3 b . Figures 1 a , 1 b and 2 show a semiconductor laser device of this invention, which comprises a highorder mode absorption region L2 between each of the window regions L1, L1 including the plane portion of the active layer 34 and the oscillation region L3 including the concaved portion of the active layer 34.The said high order mode absorption region L2 has an optical waveguide therein, the width of which is smaller than that of the optical waveguide in each of the window regions L1 and L1. This semiconductor laser device is produced as follows As shown in Figure 1 a , on a p GaAs substrate 31, an n GaAs current blocking layer 32 is grown by liquid phase epitaxy, followed by an etching treatment to form a trapezoid channel S in the center portion thereof, a V shaped channel T in each of both end portions thereof and a V shaped channel U between the trapezoid channel S and each of the V channels T and T.The widths of the channels T, U and S are 4 pm, 2 pm and 7 pm, respectively. Then, on the current blocking layer 32 including the channels T, U and S, a p GaAlAs cladding layer 33, a GaAlAs active layer 34, an n CaAlAs cladding layer 35, and an n GaAs cap layer 36 are successively grown by liquid phase epitaxy. Ohmic contact layers 37 and 38 are then formed by vacuum deposition on the back face of the p GaAs substrate 31 and the upper face of the n GaAs cap layer 36, respectively, resulting in a semiconductor laser device. The portion of the active layer 34 corresponding to the V channel T is the window region L1, the portion of the active layer 34 corresponding to theV channel U is the high order mode absorption region L2, and the other portion of the active layer 34 corresponding to the trapezoid channel S is the oscillation region L3. A semiconductor laser device with the abovementioned structure oscillates at a low threshold current level since the portion of the active layer 34 in the oscillation region L3 is curved in the same manner as that shown in Figure 3 d . Moreover, in the semiconductor laser device, since an optical waveguide is formed within each of the window regions L1 and L1, the radiation of beams does not arise but the beam waists are positioned near the facets 41 and 42. Therefore, deterioration of the facets 41 and 42 can be prevented and a raise in the output power at which breakdown of the facets 41 and 42 occurs can be attained.Moreover, the high order mode absorption region L2 is positioned between each of the window regions L1, L1 and the oscillation region L3, thereby completely preventing gain in the high order transverse mode, so that stabilized oscillation can be attained in the fundamental transverse mode up to a high output power. Although, as a semiconductor material, theGaAlAs system alone is described in the above mentioned example, other semiconductor crystal materials such asInGaAsP systems can be used. It is understood that various other modifications will be apparent to and can be readily made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the scope of the claims appended hereto be limited to the description as set forth herein, but rather that the claims be construed as encompassing all the features of patentable novelty which reside in the present invention, including all features which would be treated as equivalents thereof by those skilled in the art to which this invention pertains
