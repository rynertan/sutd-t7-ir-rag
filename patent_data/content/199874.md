## Description
INK JET RECOR3INS SWEET HAVING INK RECEPTIVE LAYER CONTAINING PEO Background of the Invention The present invention relates to a recording sheet suitable for use in ink jet recording. InK jet recording processes nave encerged as one of the most important tecnnologies for high speed electronic printing. With tneir emergence there has arisen a need for recording papers having designed recording properties. The basic imaging technique in ins jet recording involves the use of one or more ins jet assemblies connected to a source of ink. Each ink jet includes a small orifice whicn is electromagnetically energized Dy magnetorestrictive, piezoelectric, thermal, or similar means to emit uniform droplets of inK as a continuous strea.n or as individual droplets on demand. Tne droplets are directed onto tne surface of a moving weD and controlled to form printed cbracters, The quality of tne record obtained in an ink jet recording process is hignly dependent on jet operation and the properties of the inK and the recording paper. Tne ink must be capable of forming stable ink droplets under pressure and must readily emerge from the ink jet orifice.Aqueous inks containing a water soluble dye and a numectant to prevent the ink from drying out in the jet assembly have been found to be particularly desirable. However, the absorption of these inks by the recording sheet has been somewhat problematic, particularly in the area of multicolor printing were two or more inK drops may overlap on the surface of the recording sheet. To oDtain good image quality, tne recording sneet must absorb tne ink rapidly and at the same time insolubil ize the ink dye on the sneet surface. Tne former property reduces tne tendency for set off i.e., transfer of tne lnK from tne paper to sneet handling rollers and the líKe wnereas tne latter property insures tnat images having high optical density are obtained. Unfortunately, these two properties are in conflict with one another. Papers having high absorbency draw tne ink deeply into te paper, and as a result, the optical density of the image formed at tne paper surface is reduced. Tney also suffer from fethering, poor edge acuity, and show through.Papers with low absorbency, such as hignly sized papers, provide good optical density by retaining tne ink at the paper surface bot nave a nigh tendency to set off because tne ing vehicle is not absorbed rapidly. Tne perfect ink jet recording sneet nas been described as a Plotter witfl a magic film. The plotter rapidly absorbs the ink venicle while tne magic fiim insures that the colorant is retained at tne surface of tne sheet wnere its lignt adsorbing and reflecting properties are greatest. If tne colorant is carried deeply into the paper web, its absorbing strength is reduced, web fibers conduct the ink laterally and poor image sharpness and show through occurs. See P.A. McManus et al, PaperRequirements for Color Imaging with Ink Jets , TAPPI, Vol.66, No. 7, July, 1983, pp. 81 5. Several types of papers nave been proposed for use in ink jet recorcing. In some cases the basis weignt, apparent density and filler content of a paper are adjusted to obtain modified absorption properties see Japan Kokai 74340 1977 to Jujo Paper Mfg. Co. . In other cases certain cationic sizing agents, such as cat ionized petroleum resins, have been added to tne paper in the size press to achieve more desirable ink absorption cnaracteristics seeJapan Kokai 109783 1981 to Mitsuolsni Paper Mills, Ltd. .Dye absorbing layers containing certain dye mordants have been provided on the surface of the recording sheet in some cases. Where high quality copies are desired, it has oeen known to use a paper having an ink receptive layer on the surface thereof. The ink receptive layer is forlnj of white pigments and an aqueous Dinner. Tne pignents ennance the quality of tne image by imparting a hign level of whiteness to tne copy and reflecting incident lignt and also serve as a substrate wnicn rinds the inK jet recording ink. Aqueous binders are used to enhance tne asorption of the ink vehicle. Crooks et al, IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin,Vol. 21, No. 6, November 1978 discloses a recoraing paper coated with a layer of a water soluble polymer such as starch, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and polyvinyl alcohol Maekawa et al, U.S. Patent 4,446,174 describes a recording paper having an ink receptive layer including a dye aDsorDing pigment such as zeolite, clay, attapulgite, and diatomaceous earth and a winder. A numDer of binders are disclosed in the patent including binders having dissociable dye absorbing groups such as polyacrylates, styrene maleic annydride copolymer, sodium alginate, ethylene maleic anhydride copolymer and cationic starch and binders not having dissociable groups such as starch, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and styrenebutadiene latex. Murakami et al, U.S. Patent 4,425,405 discloses an inK jet recording sheet in which the ink receptive layer contains polyvinylpyrrolidone and or vinylpyrrolidone vinyl acetate copolymer and a wnite filler. Optionally tne layer may also include a water insoluble Dinder to impart moisture resistance. Ink jet recording papers are also Known in wnich the dye absoring characteristics of tne paper itself are beneficially modified by incorporating certain polymers or sizing agents into the paper itself. Maekawa et al, U.S.Patent 4,308,542, and Minagawa, U.S. Patent 4,269,891 ciescrioe inK jet recording papers prepared from syntnetic paper. Tne papers are designed to enable viewing tne images by reflection or by transmission of lignt tnrough tne recording sheet. Certain water soluble adhesives having a hignly flydrophilic cnaracters, including among tnem polyethylene oxide, are added to tne pulp to improve surface strengtn and improve tne inK absorption properties. Wnile tnere are numerous examples of inK jet recording papers in the art, there is a need for alternative papers and there is particularly a need for coated papers suitable in nign quality printing. Summary of the Invention It is one object of tne present inventions to provide an ink jet recording paper useful in hign quality printing applications. It is another oDject of the present invention to provide an inK jet recording paper naming an inK receptive layer containing a white pigment and a binder wnich exhibits excellent ink receptivity and is aDle to control ink dot spreading i.e., size and uniformity . It is a further object of tne present invention to provide an inK jet recording paper naving an lns receptive layer containing a pigment and a Dinder wnicn exhibits less tacK at nign moisture nutridity levels and provides waterfastness. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a pigmented ink jet recording layer that is useful with botn aqueous and solvent based inks. Tnese and otner oD3ects are acnieved in accordance with the present invention which provides an ink jet recording paper comprising a paper support and an inKreceptive coating on at least one surface of said support, said inK receptive coating including a wnite pigment dispersed in polyethylene oxide. Detailed Description of the Invention The ink aDsorptive qualities of tne paper of the present invention will vary with tne amount and the mole cular weight of the polyetnylene oxide incorporated Into the ink receptive layer as well as otner factors such as the nature of the pigment, the presence of other additives, and the manner of coating. Tne inK receptive layer used in the present invention in its simplest form includes a white pigment and polyethylene oxide. However, polyethyl ene oxide does not provide sufficient binding strengt,. to satisfy all the requirements of the recording process.Ink receptive layers consisting of polyethylene oxide and pigment tend to dust, i.e., lose pigment more readily and sometimes crack. For this reason it is preferred to include an additional resin in the composition to ennance binding strength and thereby reduce dusting and improve the integrity of the layer. The molecular weight of the polyethylene oxide used in the present invention may range from about 100,000 to 900,000 and preferably from about 100,000 to 300,000. Suitable resins useful in ennancing tne Dinding strength of polyetnylene oxide can De selected from among a numDer of hign molecular materials conventionally used in papers or paper coatings. A binder snoula be selected whicn is compatible with the polyethylene oxide. Repre3en tative examples of useful polymers include polyvinyl acetate, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, polyiaetn acrylates, polyacrylates, polyvinyl alcohol, oxidized starch, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, styrene maleic acid copolymer, styrene Dutadiene copolymer and the like. Polyvinyl alcohol and starch are usually used Deause they are relatively inexpensive and tney provide good binding strength. Tne polyethylene oxide is usually used in the inK receptive layer in an amount of about 5 to 70t Dy weight and preferably 10 to 40 by weight based on the dry weight of tne ink receptive layer. Tne amount of otner resin included in the ink receptive layer to enhance binding strength will vary with its nature, the amount and nature of the filler used and other factors. Typically, these other resins may be incorporated into the coating in an amount of about 0 to 60 by weight dry or in wight ratio to the polyethylene oxide of about 1 10 to 10 1. Examples of fillers which can be used in the practice of the invention in comDination with polyethylene oxide include clay, talc, calcium carDonate, alumina and alumina hydrate, zeolite, synthetic silica, calcium sulfate, diatomaceous earth, magnesium silicate, barium carbonate, barium sulfate, aluminum silicate, magnesium oxide, magnesium carbonate, calcium silicate, satin wnite, etc. Tne preferred filler is synthetic silica e.g.,Syloid 244 from W. R. Grace Co. . It may De desirable to dilute the silica with another white filler in some cases.Tne filler is generally used in an amount of about 5 to 90 and preferably 40 to 90 by weight based on the dry weight of tne recording layer. Tne recording cnaracteristics of tne ink jet recording paper of the present invention are generally improved by the addition of a cationic resin and or polyvalent metal salt. In most applications, aqueous ink compositions containing acid or direct dyes are used in ink jet recording. These dyes advantageously react with the cations provided by the resin or tne metal salt and become more rapidly set in the inK receptive layer. Tnis tends to prevent off set and further reduce featnering and dot spread. Useful cationic polymers are cnaracterized by a hign cationic character. Such polymers are typically made up of at least 3 mol cationic monomer units and preferably at least 10 mol and up to 100 . Polymeric amines such as polymers of quaternary amines or amines converted to quaternary amines under acid conditions can be used.The cationic character of these polymers can De expressed as a nitrogen concentration since the nitrogen present in the polymers generally is in the form of cationic quaternary ammonium groups. Thus, tne polymer cationic amines used in t resent invention can be characterized as having a nitrogen content in excess of about 0.1 , preferably in excess of 1.58 and still more preferably in excess of 3,0t by weight. A useful class of cationic polymers are so called electroconductive polymers which are conventionally used in electrophotographic, electrographic or electrostatographic processes. Examples of such polymers are described in U.S. Patents 3,011,918 3,544,318 4,148,639 4,171,417 4,316,943 and 3,813,264. Tnese polymers are characterized by the presence of a high percentage of cationic groups such as tertiary amino and quaternary ammonium cationic groups.Representative polymers are nomopolymers or copolymers of cationic monomers such as quaternary diallyldiakylammonium chlorides sucn as diallyldimethylammonium chloride, N alkylammonium chlorides, methacrylamidopropyl trimethylammonium chloride, methacryloxyethyl trimetnyl ansmonium chloride, 2 hydroxy 3 methacryloxypropyl tri methylammonium chloride, methacryloxyethyl trimethylammonium methosulfate, vinylbenzyl trimethylammonium chloride and quaternized 4 vinylpyridine. Representative examples of commercially available cationic polymers that are useful in the present invention are Warcofix 808 a guanidine formaldehyde polymer available from Sun Chemical Corp. , Calgon 261 LV and CalgonConductive Polymer 7091 RV pc lydimetnydiallylamzoonium chlorides available from Calgon Corp. , Nalco 8674 a cationic polyamine available from Nalco Corp. , and CATFloc C available from Calgon Corp. . The polyvalent metal salts used in the present invention are polyvalent water soluble salts of polyvalent cations from Group II, Group III or the Transition Metals of the Periodic Table of Elements. Typically, these salts can be dissolved in water in an amount greater than 5 g 100m1 at 230C. Tne most readily available and cost effective salts are Zn2 2, Al3 , Mg2 , Ca2 and Ba2 salts. Salts which tend to color the paper such as Foe 2 , Fe3 , and Cu2 , while functional, must be used in limited amounts or not at all. Preferably, the salts are salts of one of the aforesaid polyvalent cations and an anion of a weak acid such as an anion of an acid having a pKa value greater than 2.0 and, more preferably, greater than 3.0. Salts of strong acid anions such as alum are capable of insoluDilizing an ink jet dye but are generally undesirable because they impart high acidity to the paper wnich accelerates degradation. Thus, while chlorides, sulfates, chlorates, and nitrates are useful, the preferred salts are acetates, formates, chlorohydrates, malonates, succinates, and salts of other weak organic acids. Specific examples of salts useful in the present invention are alum, calcium formate, and aluminum cnlorohydrate. Certain zirconium Zr 3 , Zr 4 , and Zr5 salts are also believed to be useful such as zirconium oxychloride and zirconium hydroxycnloride. The ink receptive layer of the present invention may contain about 5 to 50 by weight of the aforementioned cationic resins and or about 1 to 258 by weight of the polyvalent metal salt. The ink receptive layer is typically formed by preparing an aqueous dispersion of polyetnylene oxide, filler and any other additive s and coating it onto a support in a conventional manner. Conventional paper coating machines such as blade coaters, air knife coaters, roll coaters, brush coaters, gravure coaters, size presses, rod coaters, and curtain coaters may be used for this purpose. The coating composition may De applied to the support in an amount of about 1 to 40 g m2 on a dry basis and preferably 5 to 20 g m2. The upper limit on the thickness is not as critical. After the coating is dried it may be smoothed by calendering if desired. In general, there are no restrictions on the type of paper that may support an inK receptive layer in accordance with the present invention. Any restrictions on the paper support typically are a product of the recording application or the recording apparatus rather than the coating composition. For most applications, papers having a basis weight of about 12 to 30 pounds per 1300 sq. ft., an apparent density in the range of 0.3 to 1.2 and filler content of 0 to 40t are useful. In general, conventional Dleached Kraft and bleacned sulfite pulps can be used in tne present invention. Waterleaf, low size, hign size and bond paper can be used. The coating can also be used with certain synthetic papers or applied to polymeric films. The preferred support tnickness is aDout 30 to 150 microns. Representative examples of thermoplastic films whicn can be used in the present invention include polyester films sucn as polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polymetnylmethacrylate and cellulose acetate. The ink jet recording paper of the present invention is preferably used in conjunction witn aqueous inK jet recording inks but it can also be used with certain solvent based inks. Representative examples of useful dyes include acid dyes such as Tartrazine Cl 19140 , Quinoline Yellow CI 47005 , Eosin CI 45380 , Erytnrosine CI 45430 , Brilliant Cyanine 6B CI 42660 , Acid Black 1 CI 20470 , Acid Black 36 CI 27275 and Acid Blue Black lOB CI 20470 , Acid Blue 193 CI 15707 , Acid Blue 194 CI 17941 , Acid Blue 249 CI 74220 and direct dyes sucn as Direct Black 19, Direct Black 49, Direct Black 56,Direct Black 74, Direct Black 103, Direct Black GW, Capamine Black ESA, Deep Black XA CI Direct BlacK 154 ,Black G CI 35255 , Pnthalocyanine Blue CI 74180 , DirectBlue 78, Direct Blue 239, Direct Blue 120, Direct Blue 110, Direct Blue 19, Direct Scarlet 4B5 CI 29160 .
