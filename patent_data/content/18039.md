## Description
FABRIC SOFTENING COMPOSITION This invention relates to fabric softening compositions and, in particular, to compositions in aqueous medium having improved softening effectiveness combined with excellent physical characteristics, especially formulation stability. Conventional rinse added fabric softening compositions contain fabric softening agents which are substantially water insoluble cationic materials usually having two long alkyl chains. Typical of such materials are distearyl di methyl ammonium chloride and imidazolinium compounds substituted with two stearyl groups. These materials are normally prepared in the form of an aqueous dispersion or emulsion, and it is generally not possible to prepare such aqueous dispersions with more than about 6 of cationic material without taking special precautions to ensure acceptable viscosity and stability characteristics. Indeed, with cationic levels in excess of about 8 the problems of physical instability and high viscosity become, in the case of conventional fabric softening products, almost intractable.This, of course, limits the level of softening performance achievable with conventional compositions without using excessive amounts of product, and also adds substantially to distribution and packaging costs, because of the need to market such dilute solutions of the active ingredient. One approach which has been taken to improve the softening performance of cationic fabric softeners has been via the incorporation of certain fatty or oily materials in the softener active system, While these adjunct materials have little intrinsic softening capability in their own right, tey are apparently effective in extending the performance of conventional cationic softening materials, both in concentrated and normal softener compositions so that the cost effectiveness of these compositions is considerably improved.Moreover, by incorporating relatively high proportions of the oily adjunct materials in relation to the cationic softener, and by adding hereto relatively high proportions of a water soluble cat ionic surfactant in relation to the cationic softener1 concentrated softening compositions can be prepared containing a high total level of active softening materials. Reference is made to European PatentApplication No. 78200059 and Belgian Patent No. 868,934, both of which are relevant to this general approach. Formulations prepared in this manner, however, are still not entirely satisfactory. Thus, while such compositions do allow a high concentration of active ingredient, the level of softness benefit delivered by such compositions on a unit active weight basis is still much lower than for conventional dilute products and problems of physical formulation characteristics, especially phase stability and also viscosity, still remain. Indeed, phase stability remains a problem even in the case of dilute softener compositions formulated in the manner of the above prior art references. Other approaches have also been taken for improving the physical characteristics of softener compositions of course. Thus, it is generally known for example in U.S.Patent No. 3,681,241 that the presence of ionizable salts in concentrated compositions do help reduce viscosity, but these materials do not offer the additional benefit of enhancing the softening performance of the compositions. More importantly, the quantity of ionizable salts required for significant viscosity reduction is found to be generally deleterious in terms of product stability. Dutch patent application no. 6706178 relates to viscosity control in fabric softening compositions with up to 12 of cationic softener, and suggests the use of low molecular weight hydrocarbons for this purpose, whileGerman patent application no. 25 03 026 discloses a complex softener disinfectant composition in which a long chain fatty alcohol is suggested as a solubilization aid.Finally, U.S. Patent No. 3,793,196 describes an improved viscosity softening agent in the form of an oil in water emulsion comprising a cationic surface active agent, a higher fatty alcohol, a sorbitan fatty acid ester and a polyethoxylated nonionic surfactant The present invention accordingly provides a fabric softening composition having improved softening characteristics and cost effectiveness combined with excellent physical characteristics, especially phase stability, freeze thaw behaviour and low viscosity and it further provides a concentrated fabric softening composition having satisfactory characteristics for consumer use, based on cationic fabric softener as the major active component. According to the present invention, there is provided an aqueous fabric softening composition characterized by Ca from 2 to 22 by weight of a water insoluble cationic fabric softener, b from 0.05 to 8 by weight of a water soluble cationic or nonionic surfactant or mixture thereof, and c from 0.25 to 15 by weight of a C10 C40 non cyclic hydrocarbon, or of a fatty acid ester of a monohydric alcohol, said ester having a total of 10 to 40 carbon atoms, or of a mixture thereof, wherein the weight ratio of a to b is in the range from 100 1 to 5 2, and the weight ratio of a to c is in the range from 20 1 to 5 4. The physical form of the composition is that of a dispersion of an anisotropic softener phase in an aqueous isotropic surfactant solution phase. The physical form is simply determined under a polarizing microscope. The anisotropic isotropic phase system is highly important for achieving optimum viscosity, stability, softening and other textile benefits. The water insoluble cationic fabric softener is preferably a di C12 C24 alkyl or alkenyl onium salt, especially a mono or polyammonium salt, an imidazolinium salt or a mixture of such salts. Highly preferred are mono quaternary ammonium salts, imidazolinium salts and mixtures thereof. The water soluble cationic surfactant is preferably a mono C8 24 alkyl or alkenyl onium salt, especially a mono or polyammonium salt, an imidazolinium salt, a pyridinium salt or a mixture of such salts. Highly preferred are mono quaternary ammonium salts, imidazolinium salts and mixtures thereof. The preferred water soluble nonionic surfactant has the general formula ROCCH2CH20 nH wherein R is a C820 alkyl or alkenyl group, and n is from 2 to about 100. From the point of view of optimum product stability and viscosity and softening performance, the weight ratio of water insoluble cationic to water soluble cationic and or nonionic surfactant, falls preferably in the range from about 20 1 to about 4 1, especially from about 15 1 to about 6 1. The weight ratio of the cationic softener to the hydrophobic adjunct, on the other hand, preferably falls in the range from about 8 1 to about 2 1. In terms of level, compositions of the invention preferably comprise from about 0.1 to about 6 of the water soluble cationic and or nonionic surfactant, from about 0.5 to about 6 of the non cyclic hydrocarbon and from 0 to about 6 of the fatty acid ester., In the present specification, percentage figures given for components in a composition refer to the weight percent of that component in the composition. With regard to the hydrophobic adjunct, highly preferred materials are C12 C24, especially C12 C20 paraffins or paraffin mixtures, esters of C12 C24 fatty acids with monohydric alcohols having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and mixtures of these paraffin and fatty acid ester materials in a 3 1 to 1 3 weight ratio. At lower concentrations of water insoluble cationic softener, less than about 6 by weight, it is preferred to include relatively low levels of water soluble surfactant in relation to the insoluble softener for achieving optimum stabilityand viscosity, while at higher,concentrations of water insoluble cationic softener, greater than about 12 by weight, it is desirable to include relatively high levels of water soluble surfactant in relation to the insoluble softener, Thus, there are three highly preferred executions A A composition comprising a from 2 to 6 by weight of a water insoluble di C12 C24 alkyl or alkenyl mono quaternary ammonium salt, b from 0.05 to 1 by weight of a water soluble cationic surfactant which is i a mono C8 C24 alkyl or alkenyl mono quaternary salt, t a mono C8 C24 alkyl or alkenyl imidazolinium salt, or iii a mixture thereof, and c from 0.25 to 3 by weight of a C12 C24 paraffin or paraffin mixture, wherein the weight ratio of a to b is in the range from 20 1 to 4 1 and the weight ratio of a to c is in the range from 5 1 to 2 1. B A composition comprising a from 6 to 12 by.weight of a water insoluble cationic fabric softener which is a mixture of i a di C12 C24 alkyl or alkenyl mono quaternary ammonium salt, and ii a di C12 C alkyl or alkenyl. imidazolinium salt, wherein the weight ratio of i to ii is in the range from 1 6 to 1 1, b from 0.5 to 6 by weight of a water soluble cationic surfactant which is i a mono C8 C24 alkyl or alkenyl mono quaternary ammonium salt, ii a mono C8 C24 alkyl or alkenyl imidazolinium salt, or iii a mixture thereof, and c from 1 to 6 by weight of a C12 C24 prefer ably C12 C20 paraffin of paraffin mixture, wherein the weight ratio of a to b is in the range from 10 1 to 5 2, and the weight ratio of a to c is in the range from 5 1 to 5 2 and C A composition comprising a from 32 to 22 of a water insoluble di C12 C24 alkyl or alkenyl imidazolinium salt, b from 2 to 8 of a water soluble cationic surfactant which is i a mono C8 C24 alkyl or alkenyl mono quaternary ammonium salt, ii a mono C8 C24 alkyl or alkenyl imidazolinium salt, or iii a mixture thereof, and c from 6 to 12 of a 3 1 to 1 3 mixture of i a C12 C24 preferably C12 C20 paraffin or paraffin mixture, and ii an ester of a C12 C24 fatty acid with a C1 C8 monohydric alcohol. wherein the weight ratio of a to b is in the range from 4 1 to 5 2, and the weight ratio of a to c is in the range from 7 2 to 5 4. Compositions of the invention thus comprise three essential ingredients, a water insoluble cationic fabric softener, a water soluble cationic and or nonionic surfactant and a hydrophobic adjunct selected from Clo C40 non cyclic hydrocarbons and fatty acid ester, the water soluble surfactant and the hydrophobic adjunct acting in combination to provide compositions of optimum viscosity and stability. The essential components will now be discussed in detail.The Cationic Fabric Softener The water insoluble cationic fabric softener can be any fabric substantive cationic sompound which, in pure form as a strong acid salt e.g. chloride , has a solubility in distilled water at pH 2.5 and 200C of less than lg l, or can be a mixture of such compounds. In this context, the soluble fraction of the surfactant is taken to be that material which cannot be separated from water by centrifugal action and which passes a l00nm Nuclepore filter Registered Trade Mark . Preferred materials are di C12 C24 alkyl or alkenyl onium salts, especially mono and poly ainmonium salts, and imidazolinium salts.Optionally, the two long chain alkyl or alkenyl groups may be substituted or interrupted by functional groups such as OH, O ,CONH , COO , etc. Well known species of substantially water insoluble mono ammonium compounds are the quaternary ammonium compounds having the formula EMI8.1 wherein R1 and R2 represent alkyl or alkenyl groups of from about 12 to about 24 carbon atoms R3 and R4 represent alkyl, alkenyl or hydroxyalkyl groups containing from l to about 4 carbon atoms and X is the salt counteranion, preferably selected from halide, methyl sulfate and ethyl sulfate radicals.Representative examples of these quaternary softeners include ditallow dimethyl ammonium chloride ditallow dimethyl ammonium methyl sulfate dihexadecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride di hydrogenated tallow alkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride dioctadecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride dieicosyl dimethyl ammonium chloride didocosyl dimethyl ammonium chloride di hydrogenated tallow dimethyl ammonium methyl sulfate dihexadecyl diethyl ammonium chloride di coconut alkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride and di coconut alkyl dimethyl ammonium methosulfate.Of these ditallow dimethyl ammonium chloride and di hydrogenated tallow alkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride are preferred. Another preferred class of water insoluble cationic materials are the alkyl imidazolinium salts believed to have the formula EMI9.1 wherein R6 is an alkyl containing from 1 to 4, preferably 1 or 2 carbon atoms, R7 is an alkyl containing from 12 to 24 carbon atoms, R8 is an alkyl containing from 12 to 24.carbon atoms, and R9 is hydrogen or an alkyl containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and X is the salt counter anion, preferably a halide, methosulfate or ethosulfate.Preferred imidazolinium salts include 3 methyl 1 tallowylamido ethyl 2 tallowyl 4,5 dihydroimidazolinium methosulfate and 3 methyl l palmitoylamido ethyl 2 octadecyl 4, 5 dihydroimidazolinium. chloride. Other useful imidazolinium materials are 2 heptadecyl 3 methyl 1 2 stearylamido ethyl 4,5 dihydroimidazolinium chloride and 2 lauryl 3 hydroxyethyl 1 oleylamido ethyl 4,5 dihydro imidazolinium chloride. Also suitable herein are the imidazolinium fabric softening components of U.S. PatentNo. 4,127,489, incorporated herein by reference. In the present invention, the water insoluble cationic softener is present at a level of at least about 2 below this level, the volume of product required to provide an acceptable level of softness benefit becomes excessively large. For softener levels in the range of about 2 to about 6 , there is, of course, generally no difficulty in preparing products of conventional type with the necessary low viscosity and good stability by adding, for instance, a low level of calcium chloride.For corresponding products based on mixed cationic hydrocarbon or ester softeners, however, product stability and viscosity become a problem and the overall aim is to adjust the levels of the softening and surfactant components within the prescribed limits to provide products which are stable to separation in a centrifuge at 3000 r.p.m. for 16 hours and which have a viscosity of less than about 350 cp, preferably less than about 150 cp measured in a Brookfiel Viscometer, using Spindle No. 2at60 r.p.m. and at 210C. The maximum level of cationic softener in the present formulations is determined by practical considerations thus, above a cationic softener level of 22 the problems of physical stability and product viscosity are such that it is not generally possible to formulate stable pourable emulsions based on water insoluble cationic softener as the major softening component.The Water Soluble Surfactant The water soluble surfactant is a cationic or nonionic surfactant having a solubility in distilled water at pH 2.5 and 200C of greater than lg l. Once again, the solubility of the cationic surfactant is defined with reference to the pure material in the form of a strong acid salt Ce.g. chloride , and the soluble fraction of the surfactant is taken to be that material which cannot be separated from water by centrifugal action and which passes a 100 nm Nuclepore filter. Preferred water soluble cationic surfactants are mono C8 C24 alkyl or alkenyl ammonium salts1 imidazolinium salts, pyridinium salts and mixtures thereof. Suitable water soluble mono ammonium compounds have the general formula EMI11.1 wherein R5 represents a C8 C24 alkyl or alkenyl group,EMI11.2 R6 represents hydrogen, a C1 C12 alkyl, alkenyl or hydroxyalkyl group, an aryl group, a C 1 6 alkylaryl group, or a poly ethylene oxide group having from 2 to 20 ethylene oxide units, R7, R8 individually represent hydrogen, a C1 C4 alkyl, alkenyl or hydroxyalkyl group or a poly ethylene oxide group having from 2 to 20 ethylene oxide units and X is as defined above.

Highly preferred water soluble polyammonium cation materials are represented by the general formula EMI13.1 wherein R11 is selected from an alkyl or alkenyl group having from 12 to 24, preferably from 16 to 20 carbon atoms in the alk en yl chain, R11CO and R11 O CH2 n each R10 is independently selected from hydrogen, C2H4O pH, C3H6O qH, C2H4O r C3H6O sH, a C1 3 alkyl group and the group CH2 n N R 2, wherein R is selected from hydrogen, C2H4O pH, C2H4O pH, C2H4O p C3H6O qH and C13 alkyl n is an integer from 2 to 6, preferably 2 or 3 m is an integer from 1 to 5, preferably 1 or 2 p,q,r,and s are each a number such that the total p q r s in the molecule does not exceed. 25 preferably, each p and q is 1 or 2 and each r and s is 1 and X represents one or more anions having total charge balancing that of the nitrogen atoms. Preferred water soluble cationic materials are alkoxylated and contain not more than one C2H40H or C3H6OH group attached to each nitrogen atom, except that up to two of these groups can be attached to a terminal nitrogen atom which is not substituted by an alkyl group having from 10 to 24 carbon atoms. Polyamine species suitable for use herein include N tallowyl,N,N ,N tris 2 hydroxyethyl 1,3 propanediamine di hydrochloride or dibenzoate N soybean alkyl 1,3 propane diammonium sulfate N stearyl,N,N di 2 hydroxyethyl N 3 hydroxypropyl 1,3 propanediamine dihydrofloride.

The water soluble cationic surfactant herein can also be represented by alkyl pyridinium salts having the following formula EMI14.1 wherein R12 is a C10 C24, preferably C16 or C18 alkyl radical and X is a suitable anion as defined hereinbefore, preferably a halide, especially chloride or bromide. It should be understood, of course, that water soluble cationic surfactants of the amine salt class can be added in the form of the neutral amine followed by pH adjustment to within the range from about pH4 to about pH8. The Hydrophobic Adjunct The hydrophobic adjunct is selected from non cyclic hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters of monohydric alcohols and mixtures thereof, each component having a total of from 10 to 40 carbon atoms. The hydrophobic adjunct is present in an amount relative to the insoluble cationic softener and the water soluble cationic and or nonionic surfactant, to provide a dispersion of anisotropic softener phase in isotropic aqueous surfactant phase. The first class of hydrophobic adjunct is represented by non cyclic hydrocarbons having from 10 to 40, preferably from 12 to 24, more preferably from 12 to 20 carbon atoms. Preferably, hydrocarbons useful in the present invention are paraffins or olefins, but other materials, such as alkynes and halo paraffins., for example myristyl chloride or stearyl bromide, are not excluded. Materials known generally as paraffin oil, soft paraffin wax and petrolatum are especially suitable. Examples of specific materials are tetradecane, hexadecane, octadecane and octadecene. Preferred commercially available paraffin mixtures include spindle oil and light oil and technical grade mixtures of C14 C17 and C18 C20 n paraffins. The second class of hydrophobic adjunct is represented by fatty acid esters having a total of 10 to 40 carbon atoms. Preferred materials are esters ofC8 C24 fatty acids with mono hydric alcohols having from 1 to 8, especially from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The mono hdyric alcohol portion of the ester can be represented by methanl, ethanol,. n propanol, isopropanol, n butanol, iso butanol, t butanol, 2 ethylhexanol and iso octanol. Examples cf such materials are methyl laurate, ethyl stearate, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate. iso butyl stearate, isopropylstearate, 2 ethylhex 1 laurate and isooctyl myristate. Of the above, iso butyl stearate is highly preferred. Of all the above, paraffins having from 12 to 20 carbon atoms constitute the preferred adjunct. However, mixtures of paraffins and fatty acid esters in a 3 1 to 1 3 weight ratio are also effective. Apart from enhancing the phase stability of the composition, the hydrophobic adjunct acts to lower the viscosity óf the composition and because each of the materials has a long fatty chain, the agent does contribute to some extent to the softening performance of the composition, a feature which is not shared by other known viscosity control agents, for example electrolytes and low molecular weight solvent materials. Compositions of the present invention also have enhanced dispersibility in cold water and exhibit less dispenser residues than conventional fabric softening composition based solely on a cationic fabric softener.Optional Ingredients In addition to the above mentioned components, the compositions may contain other textile treatment or conditioning agents. Such agents include silicones, as for example described in German Patent ApplicationDOS 26 31 419 incorporated herein by reference. The optional silicone component can be used in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 6 , preferably from 0.5 to 2 of the softener composition. A further optional component of the present composition is a fatty acid ester of a polyhydric alcohol, for instance a C12 C22 fatty acid ester of ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, diglycerol, xylitol, sucrose, erythritol, pentaerythritol, sorbitol or sorbitan. These esters, specific examples of which include ethyleneglycol monostearate, propyleneglycol monostearate, glyceryl monostearate and glyceryl distearate, can provide an additional softening facility.However, in as much as such fatty acid esters are relatively hydrophilic and indeed are emulsifying materials in their own rights, it is desirable to include such materials in a level of no more than about 4 by weight or in a weight ratio with respect to the cationic softener of no more than about 2 3. The compositions herein can contain other optional ingredients which are known to be suitable for use in textile sogteners at usual levels for their known functions.Such adjuvants include emulsifiers, perfumes, preservatives, germicides, colorants, dyes fungicides, stabilizers, brighteners and opacifiers. These adjuvants, if used, are normally added at their conventional low levels. The composition of the invention can also comprise additional viscosity control agents, such as 1 to 10 of lower alcohols, especially ethanol and isopropanol, and electrolytes, for example calcium chloride, at levels of from 100 to 1000 ppm. It is a feature of the invention, however, that such materials can be reduced or eliminated completely from the instant compositions. The compositions can normally be prepared by mixing the ingredients together in water, heating to a temperature of about 6O0C and agitating for 5 30 minutes. The pH of the compositions is generally adjusted to be in the range from about 3 to about 8, preferably from about 4 to about 6. In this preferred pH range, it will be understood that the neutralization of amines or polyamines in the composition can be incomplete. When compositions of the present invention are added to the rinse liquor, a concentration from about 10 ppm to 1000 ppm, preferably from about 50 ppm to about 500 ppm, of total active ingredient is appropriate.
