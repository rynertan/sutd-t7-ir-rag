# Process for setting a latex of a film forming polymer.

## Abstract
Delayed action setting of a composition comprising an anionic latex of a film forming polymer is effected by the addition of a delayed action setting agent which is a mixture of 1 a compound containing a multivalent metal cation, which compound has a solubility in the range of 0.1g to 150g per 100g of cater at 20 C and which has a dissolution time greater than 1 minute, and 2 an alkali metal silicofluoride. Other film forming materials such as bitumen may be present in the composition. The process is particularly useful for mixtures of polychloroprene latex and bitumen emulsion. The compound 1 can be either one which gives or one which does not give exudation or sweating of water from the latex. A preferred compound of the former type is calcium sulphate hemihydrate. The preferred fluoride 2 is sodium silicofluoride. The composition may also contain an inert non hydraulic particulate filler which can be a harder filler, e.g. sand, or a deformable filler, e.g. tyre crumbs, or a mixture of the two.
