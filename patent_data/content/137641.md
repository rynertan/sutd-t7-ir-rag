# RAPID LPE CRYSTAL GROWTH

## Abstract
An apparatus and a method for growth of material on substrates. A substrate at temperature T₂ is placed with a surface in contact with solution in streamline flow through a narrow channel. The solution enters the channel with a temperature, T₁, which is above its saturation temperature, T
