# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IMPROVED MONITORING AND DETECTION OF IMPROPER DEVICE OPERATION

## Abstract
A method and apparatus is disclosed for the improved monitoring and detection of improper device operation. Operation of a prototype device 10 is first modeled. In particular, a set of test vectors is selected to provide a desired degree of testing of the prototype unit 10 . The expected response of the prototype to the selected set of test vectors is determined through the use of analytical predic tion means 16 , and stored for subsequent comparison with the operation of the prototype unit. Thereafter, the selected set of test vectors are applied to the prototype unit, and the responses thereto compared in real time with the expected responses. Improper operation of the prototype device is thereby identified, and associate information recorded for subsequent analysis.
