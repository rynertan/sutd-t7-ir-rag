## Description
The invention relates to an arrangement for digitising television signals, which signals comprise a luminance portion whose amplitude changes at a relatively low frequency and a high frequency colour subcarrier portion, said arrangement comprising a first and second analogue to digital converter, means for separating the luminance and colour subcarrier portions, means for applying the separated luminance portion to the first analogue to digital converter, and means for applying the separated colour subcarrier portion to the second analogue to digital converter. The invention further relates to an arrangement for measuring television signals and to a television transmitter. Broadcasting authorities generally require their transmitters to meet certain requirements concerning the quality of the transmitted signals. Among the more important parameters that have to be monitored or controlled are linearity and differential gain. With the growing use of computers for analysing signals it becomes desirable to digitise the television signals to make them convenient to handle. In the UK both the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Independent Broadcasting Authority insert test signals into certain lines of the television signal during the field blanking period. These signals include a portion which includes a luminance portion having a staircase form on each step of which a constant amplitude colour subcarrier wave is superimposed. This can be used to measure three important non linear distortions, i.e. luminance non linearity, differential gain, and differential phase. If this signal is converted directly to a digital representation then in order to satisfy the Nyquist Criterion it must be sampled at a rate greater than twice the video signal bandwidth, i.e. faster than 11MHz in the UK. In practice the analysis is easier to carry out if the sampling rate is four times the colour subcarrier frequency 17.7MHz . The digitisation must also be very accurate since any error in the conversion process will cause a much larger error in the calculated values of luminance non linearity and differential gain.If these parameters need to be measured to within about 1 then a 10 bit analogue to digital converter is required. The combination of high speed of operation and high accuracy is expensive. There are a variety of methods which allow the signal to be digitised in a less expensive manner, but all the known methods tend to degrade the speed, accuracy or susceptability to noise of the arrangement. One method, which is used in the Tektronix Automatic Video Measurement Set 1980 Answer, is to use a high speed reduced resolution analogue to digital converter and to add a dither signal to the analogue video input. The full resolution is eventually obtained by averaging the resultant digital signal over many repeated occurances of the test signal. Another method, which is used in the Thomson CSF TTV 8400 System, is to use a low speed full resolution analogue to digital converter and to build up a complete replica of the test signal by taking a few samples from each of successive test signals. This is however a slow process which is susceptable to noise. It is an object of the invention to enable the digitisation of video signals to be carried out in an alternative manner which mitigates at least some of the disadvantages referred to hereinbefore. The invention provides an arrangement for digitising television signals as set forth in the opening paragraph characterised in that the colour subcarrier signal has a relatively low peak value compared with that of the total television signal and the second analogue to digital converter has a lower resolution and a higher speed of operation than the first analogue to digital converter. The invention is based on the recognition of the fact that the most important parameters which have to be monitored can be determined by analysis of the staircase portion of the test signal and that by separating the two components of the staircase and separately digitising them it is possible to maintain the full speed and accuracy without the use of an analogue to digital converter having both a high speed of operation and high resolution. The second analogue to digital converter may operate at an integral multiple of the colour sub carrier frequency, which multiple may be four. By sampling at four times the colour sub carrier frequency 17.7MHz for the PAL System I signal the subsequent signal processing can be simplified. The operating frequency of the first analogue to digital converter may be 1 2 This enables a simple binary divider to be used to generate the clock for the first analogue to digital converter from the clock applied to the second analogue to digital converter. The arrangement may further comprise means for writing the outputs of the first and second analogue to digital converters into a store. An arrangement in which the television signal comprises a test signal for transmission on one or more lines of each television field or frame may be characterised in that the arrangement comprises means for selecting the line or lines in which the test signal is transmitted and writing the outputs of the analogue to digital converters into the store only on those lines. The arrangement may further comprise means for writing the outputs of the analogue to digital converters into the store only during a selected portion of the lines on which the test signal is transmitted. The invention further provides an arrangement for measuring the distortion of television signals transmitted by a television transmitter comprising means for receiving the transmitted signal, means for demodulating the transmitted signal, means for digitising the demodulated signal, means for analysing the digitised signal, and means for displaying the measured distortion characterised in that the means for digitising the demodulated signal comprises an arrangement for digitising television signals according to the invention. The invention still further relates to a television transmitter comprising a video signal input means for modulating a carrier signal by the video signal non linear power amplifier means for amplifying the modulated carrier signal a pre corrector circuit for applying a correction to the video signal before or after modulation and before it is applied to the power amplifier means means for measuring the distortion at the output of the power amplifying means means for generating a control signal representative of the distortion of the output of the power amplifying means and means for applying the control signal to a control input of the pre corrector circuit to reduce the distortion at the output of the power amplifying means wherein the measuring means comprises means for extracting a portion of the transmitted signal, and means for demodulating the portion to produce a demodulated television signal, characterised in that the measuring means further comprises means for digitising the demodulated television signal, the digitising means comprising an arrangement for digitising a television signal according to the invention. The television transmitter may comprise means for transmitting a test signal in a television line during the field or frame blanking interval, means for selecting the line in which the test signal is transmitted, and means for applying at least a part of the selected line to the measuring means. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which The arrangement for digitising television signals shown in Figure 1 has an input 1 for receiving an analogue television signal, the input 1 being connected to the input of a luminance chrominance separator 2. The luminance chrominance separator 2 may comprise a band pass and a low pass filter to separate a high frequency chrominance portion from a low frequency luminance portion as exists in the staircase portion of the test signal shown in Figure 5. In Figure 5 the signal amplitude V between values 0 and 1.0 is plotted versus the time t in Âµs. The chrominance portion is fed from a first output 3 of the separator 2 to a first input 4 of a timing generator 5 and to the analogue signal input of an analogue to digital converter ADC 6. The luminance portion is fed from a second output 7 of the separator 2 to a second input 8 of the timing generator 5 and to the analogue signal input of a further analogue to digital converter ADC 9. The digital signal output of the ADC 6 is fed over a path 10 to a block of random access memory RAM 11. Similarly the digital signal output of the ADC 9 is fed over a path 12 to a block of RAM A further output of the ADC 6 is connected, over a line 15, to an input of a write control circuit 14 whose output is fed to the RAM 11 over a line 16. Similarly a further output of the ADC 9 is connected to an input of a further write control circuit 17 over a line 18, the output of the further write control circuit 17 being fed to a RAM 13 over a line 19. A terminal 20 is connected In operation a television signal is fed to the input l and when a test signal of the form shown in Figure 5 is included in a given line of a field or frame the timing generator 5 produces appropriate signals from the line and field synchronising pulses to select the line on which the test signal is transmitted. The luminance chrominance separator 2 separates the low amplitude, high frequency colour sub carrier portion from the high amplitude, low frequency luminance portion of the signal. The separated colour sub carrier portion from output 3 of the separator 2 is fed to the input of the ADC 6 which in this embodiment is a 7 bit ADC which is capable of operating at four times the colour sub carrier frequency 17.7MHz for the PAL System I signal . The digitised samples are then stored in the RAM 11 under the control of the write address generator 25 and the write control circuit 14. The write control circuit 14 produces a write enable signal on line 16 under the control of a data ready signal produced by the ADC 6 and fed over line 15 and a timing signal generated by the timing generator 5 and fed over line 26. Thus in order to produce the write enable signal for the RAM 11 the timing generator 5 indicates that the appropriate television line and portion of that line is being received and the ADC 6 indicates that the signal has been digitised and that the digital representation of a particular sample is available at the output of the ADC 6. The timing generator 5 also produces a 4 The luminance portion of the television signal which is produced at the output 7 of the separator 2 is fed to the input of the ADC 9 which in this embodiment is a 10 bit ADC capable of operating at about lMHz conveniently 17.7 16MHz . The digitised luminance samples are stored in the RAM 13 under the control of the write control circuit 17 and write address generator 25. The write control circuit 17 produces a write enable signal for the RAM 13 on line 19 from similar signals to those applied to the write control circuit 14, the difference being that the data ready signal is taken from the ADC 9 over the line 18. The addresses to the RAM 13 may, conveniently, be the same as those applied to the RAM 11 with the four least significant bits deleted. Thus the addresses to the RAM 13 will change at one sixteenth of the rate at which the addresses to the RAM 11 change. The clock signal to the ADC 6 over line 22 will also be at sixteen times the rate of the clock signal to the ADC 9 over line 23. The read address generator 34 is incremented by signals applied to terminal 33. Information is read from the RAMs 11 and 13 under the control of the read address generator 34. Again the four least significant bits of the output of the read address generator 34 are not applied to the RAM 13 as only one sixteenth of the number of samples are stored in the RAM 13. The outputs from the RAMs 11 and 13 are fed to outputs 29 and 31 where they are available separately. Alternatively they could be combined in an adding arrangement to produce a digital version of the input signal, the most significant bit of the colour sub carrier signal being a sign bit. Figure 2 shows an embodiment of a timing generator suitable for use as the timing generator 5 of Figure 1. The input 4 of the timing generator is fed to a clock generator 50 which generates a clock signal at four times the colour subcarrier signal 4 The clock generator 50 comprises an oscillator having a nominal frequency of 4 Figure 3 shows in block schematic form a television transmitter employing adaptive pre correction. In order to increase the electrical power efficiency of a transmitter which employs a Klystron amplifier as the power output stage the Klystron is normally driven into a non linear region of its characteristic as close to saturation as possible. As a result it is necessary to pre correct the signal applied to the Klystron amplifier to limit the distortion at the output of the amplifier. Conventionally the pre correctors have a fixed characteristic which is designed to be the inverse of the Klystron characteristic. However, as the degree to which the Klystron is driven into saturation is increased so the demands made on the pre correction is increased and in order to meet the specifications set by the Broadcasting Authorities it is becoming necessary to improve the accuracy of the pre correction. The transmitter shown in Figure 3 employs adaptive pre correction, i.e. the characteristics of the pre correction circuits are modified in dependence on the distortion measured at the output of the Klystron amplifier. The transmitter has an input 100 to which a composite video signal is applied and which is connected to the input of a video processing circuit 101. The video processing circuit 101 strips the synchronising pulses from the composite video signal and provides a first output signal comprising the synchronising pulses which is connected The control unit 113 produces control signals which are fed to the pre corrector circuit 105 The Klystron amplifier 103 is operated as near to saturation as possible in order to increase the efficiency and the synchronising pulses are used to switch the beam current to a higher value during the synchronising period only. As a result the degree of distortion in the video signal produced by running the Klystron near to saturation is high and significant pre correction is required to meet the specification. The pre corrector circuit 105 is made adjustable so that the degree of pre correction can be controlled to produce the best possible performance. The control unit 113 takes the digitised video signal and analyses the distortion. It then produces appropriate control signals for application to the pre corrector circuit 105 to produce a pre correction characteristic which minimises the distortion of the output signal. The control unit 113 provides signals to the digitiser 111 which enable the contents of the RAMs 11 and 13 to be read at a rate at which the control unit is able to absorb and act upon them. This can be independent of the input information rate by appropriate use of the signal applied to the read address generator 34. Figure 4 shows an arrangement for measuring the distortion of a television signal. The arrangement has an input 200 for receiving a composite video signal for analysis. Alternatively the arrangement may additionally include a demodulator for demodulating a television signal produced at the output of a transmitter and, if necessary, a probe for extracting a portion of the signal from the output of the transmitter. The input 200 is connected to a digitiser 201 which may be in the form of an arrangement as shown in Figure 1. The output of the digitiser 201 is fed to a control unit 202 In operation a composite video signal is fed to the input of the digitiser 201 and stored therein. The stored samples are read by the control unit 202 and analysed and the results of the analysis are fed to the display device 205. The analysis may be carried out in a conventional manner in the control unit 202 which may comrise a microcomputer. The design of such computer based control units is known to those skilled in the art as evidenced by commercially available measuring instruments such as those referred to hereinbefore. The display device may be a video display unit or may be a printer to provide hard copy results. Intermediate storage may be included between the control unit and display device to enable measurements to be made on site and the results to be displayed at a central location.
