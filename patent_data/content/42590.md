# Phoneme information extracting apparatus.

## Abstract
A phoneme information extracting apparatus includes correlation data generators 19 I to 19 N for successively generating correlation data representing the correlation between the acoustic power spectrum data corresponding to input voice and power spectrum data of various reference phonemes, selection circuits 23 I to 23 N for successively transferring these correlation data when they detect that three or more successive correlation data have values greater than a predetermined value, maximum data hold circuits 25 I to 25 N for holding the maximum correlation data among the correlation data transferred from the respective selection circuits, and phoneme determination circuit 26 for determining the optimum phoneme by detecting one of the data hold circuits that is holding the maximum correlation data among the correlation data held in the data hold circuits 25 I to 25 N at the time when the continuity of the effective data is lost.
