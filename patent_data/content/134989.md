# Dual mode gas sampler and pneumatic flow control system.

## Abstract
A pneumatic flow control system for collecting gas samples in a collecting device at a constant preselected flow rate comprising a vacuum pump P having a suction side S and a discharge side D , with said collecting device con nected to the suction side S of said pump P , a flow control valve 12 having a flow restricting orifice 28 connected on the discharge side D of said pump P in series with said pump P and said collecting device and a flow controller 14 including means connected across the pump for diverting a supplementary flow Wâ‚‚ of gas from the discharge side of the pump into the pump suction side and valve means 49,50 responsive to the pressure differential across said flow control valve 12 for regulating said supplementary flow so as to maintain the gas flow rate through said collecting device constant at said preselected flow rate independent of load variations.
