# Alarm System Diagnostic Apparatus.

## Abstract
A diagnostic status indicating apparatus is used with an alarm system having a plurality of normally closed switch contacts 32 which are opened upon occurrence of an alarm condition. Light emitting diodes 34 are connected across the normally closed switch contacts at an opposite polarity to that of the current normally passing through the contacts in the operating mode. In order to diagnose the alarm generating condition of the electrical contacts, a switch 20 removes the operating voltage and connects a test voltage 60 at a reverse polarity, whereupon the LED 34 for any open circuited electrical contact is activated. The device is preferably based upon a double pole double throw switch and includes indicators for a test condition 62 and for a ground fault 64 .
