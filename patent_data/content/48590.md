# Extruder mixer.

## Abstract
An extruder mixer comprising a hollow cylindrical stator 14 having a cylindrical rotor 10 journalled therewithin, the facing cylindrical surfaces of the rotor and stator carrying respective pluralities of parallel circumferentially extending rows of hemispherical cavities 18,20 . In order to achieve an exponential mixing characteristic in which simple shear mixing is repeatedly interrupted by cutting and turning stages, the rotor and stator cavities 18,20 are arranged such that a the cavities 20 in adjacent rows on the stator are circumferentially offset, b the cavities 18 in adjacent rows on the rotor are circumferentially offset, and c the rows of cavities 18,20 on the stator and rotor are axially offset.
