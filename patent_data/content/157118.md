## Description
FOOT INSTEP SECURING DEVICE PARTICUIARLY INREAR ENTRANCE SKI BOOTS This invention relates to a foot instep securing device particularly in ski boots. As is known, ski boots have long been fitted with means of securing the foot instep such as to prevent the foot from moving inside the boot. Known design devices generally comprise a pressure element for coupling over the foot instep which is connected to a means effective to urge the presser itself toward the foot instep. In prior embodiments such means would comprise links or threaded rods which are operated from the boot outside, through knobs or the like arrangements, to enable the user to apply a desired pressure after putting the boot on. Such prior approaches, additionally to involving a complex construction, require a separate operation by the user who, after closing the boot, is required to adjust the presser to produce a desired securing pressure. It will be understood that such a procedure takers a relatively long time to fit the boots and carry out the desired adjustments. Another disadvantage is that operation of the knobs or the like arrangements to position the presser is relatively troublesome for the user, in view of the environmental conditions in which a skier would use the ski boots. French Patent Application 2 345 097 discloses a foot instep securing device for rear entry ski boots, comprising a foot instep presser and a flexible elongated link element overlying the presser, wherein the end sections of the link element terminate either at a distance from the pivot points of the pivotable rear quarter or are arranged in concentric relationship therewith. The linking structure is therefore rather complicated and unsafe. It is the aim of this invention to provide a foot instep securing device for use with rear entrance ski boots, which enables the foot instep to be reliably secured without any additional operation having to be performed over than the usual boot closing operations. Within the above aim, it is a particular object of the invention to provide a securing device as indicated, which allows the presser to be positioned in an adjustable manner without applying any special effort, while affording, where required, application of quite high forces to the foot instep presser. A further object of this invention is to provide a device as indicated which is constructionally simple and affords appreciable savings in production cost. The above aim, as well as these and other objects such as will be apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a foot instep securing device particularly in rear entrance ski boots having a pivotable rear quarter, the device comprising a foot instep presser housed within the shell of a ski boot, and at least one flexible elongated link element overlying said presser and being connected to a means of adjusting the working length thereof, characterized in that said means for adjusting the working length of said flexible elongated link element comprise end sections on said link element terminating near and offset troy the pivot points for said rear quarter and connected thereto so that the link element is actuated by the pivotal movement of the rear quarter of said ski boot. The term working length as used herein is intended to mean that length of the elongated flexible linking element, which determines the distance of the presser from the sole. Further features and advantages will be more readily understood from the following description of some preferred, but not exclusive, embodiments of a foot instep securing device particularly for rear entrance ski boots, with reference to the accompanying illustrative and non limitative drawings, where Figure 1 is a perspective view showing diagrammatically a first embodiment of a securing device accordinS to the invention Figure 2 shows the securing device of Figure 1 as incorporated to a ski boot Figures 3 and 4 illustrate diagrammatically the operation of the device as incorporated to a ski boot Figure 5 is a perspective view of a second embodiment of the device of this invention Figure 6 is a perspective view of the device shown in Figure 5 as incorporated to a ski boot Figures 7 and 8 diagrammatically illustrate the operation of the device according to the second embodiment thereof Figure 9 is a perspective view of a third embodiment of the device of this invention Figure 10 is a perspective view of a detail showing the coupling of two band sections forming the link element Figure 11 shows the embodiment of Figure 9 as incorporated to a ski boot and Figures 12 and 13 diagrammatically illustrate the third embodiment of this device, as incorporated to a ski boot. With reference to the drawing figures, a foot instep securing device particularly for rear entrance ski boots, according to the invention, comprises a foot instep presser, generally designated with the reference numeral 1, which has an essentially traditional configuration and is positioned inside the boot shell 2, at the foot upper toe region. Lying above the pressure element 1 is a link element which has the function of adjusting the pressure element position to apply a higher or lower pressure to the foot instep through the presser itself, thereby the user s foot can be firmly secured. A feature of the invention is that a means is provided for changing the working length of the link element, which means is actuatable directly by rotation of the ski boot rear quarter 3, without involving the use of any additional adjusting means. With reference to Figures 1 to 4, the device com prises a link element consisting of a wire cable 10 arranged to slide within a sleeve 11 at least in part overlying the pressure element and being connected at its end through eyes 12 at the side portions of the boot shell. The cable 10 is connected with its free ends to inside threaded bushings 13 which engage rotatably with opposedly handed threads 14 on a small shaft 15 supported rotatably on the shell and having at its ends bosses 16 which make it fast with the cited rear quarter 3. The bushings 13 are prevented from rotation by guides or shoulders provided in the recess in which the shaft 15 is arranged, of which only guide 13a is shown, and which allow translatory movement of the bushings 13. It will be appreciated that the end sections 10a of the cable 10 are located near the shaft 15, but slightly offset therefrom. For the purpose the bushings 13 have opposite parallel plane surfaces 13b,slidably engaging opposite guide surfaces. Thus, on opening or closing the quarter 3,a rotation is imparted to the shaft 15, whereby the bushings 13, being inhibited from turning, will perform a translatory movement relatively to the shaft, thus changing the link working length. ore specifically, in closing the rear quarter, the bushings 1 3 are caused to translate toward the middle portion of the shaft, and consequently, they will decrease the working length of the link element and cause the pressure element 1 to move downwards towards the foot instep. It should be added to the above that in this embodiment, the shaft 15 extends below the insole normally provided in the shell, thereby it creates no hinderance for the user. It may be appreciated that to release the pressure element 1, it will be sufficient to pivot the rear quarter 3 in the opposite direction, i.e. in the quarter opening direction, such that the bushings are caused to translate toward the ends of the shaft 15, thus increasing the working length of the link element 10 and, accordingly, removing the force exerted on the pressure element 1. With reference to Figures 5 to 8, this device comprises a link element cansisting of a cable 20 slidably received in a tubular sleeve 21 which is associated at one end with a small block 22 for fixed engagement in spaced apart notches 23 defined in the shell 2 to vary the applied pressure force. It will be understood, of course, that the block 22 is attached to the end of the cable 20, similarly to a Borden cable structure. The cable 20 is wound with its other end around a pulley 25 rigidly attached to a boss 26 which is in turn attached to the rear quarter 3. It will be appreciated that also in this case the end sections 20a of the cable are located near the pivot point 26 of the rear quarter, but slightly offset therefrom. Again, similarly to the first described embodiment, rotation of the rear quarter 3 results, on closing, in the cable 20 being wound onto the pulley 25 and hence, in the working length of the link element being shortened, thereby producing a pressure action, whereas a rotation of the rear quarter 3 in the opening direction results in the cable being unwound from the pulley and the pressure previously exerted on the pressure element being released. The provision of the block 22 receivable in the notches 23, which are spaced apart from one another, enables adjustment of the exerted pressure to suit the anatomy of the skier s foot. With reference to Figures 9 to 13, the inventive device comprises here a link element which is formed by first and second band sections, indicated at 30 and 31, which are connected at one end thereof to extensions 32 being an integral projecting part of the rear quarter 3 beyond the pivot axis of the quarter 3, thus providing in practice a lever arm 3b between the point of connection of the band sections 30 and 31 and the pivot axis of the rear quarter 3. Thus, also in this case the end sections 30a and 31a of the bands 30 and 31 are located near the pivot point 3a of the rear quarter 3, but slightly offset therefrom. The band sections 30 and 31, which overlie the pressure element 1, are provided at the other end with serrated portions 35 which may be mutually overlapped for coupling together.In order to hold the serrated areas 35 stably together, a slider 36 is provided which may be formed directly on the pressure element 1 and comprise a separate ring.The slider 36 has the function of holding the serrated areas 35 is close contact with each other, thus retaining continuity of the band sections forming the link element. The serrated areas have the function of allowing initial adjustment of the band section length so as to vary the pressure force exerted on the pressure element on operating the rear quarter. In operation, when the rear quarter 3 is rotated towards the closing position thereof anti clocktrise in Figure 13 , the free ends of the extensions 32 are moved downwardly and entrain therewith the band sections 30,31 so that the pressure element 1 is down wardly pressed against the foot instep. The opposite occurs when the rear quarter 3 is rotated towards its open position clockwise in Figure 12 . It may be appreciated from the foregoing that the invention achieves its objects, and in particular it should be stressed that a foot instep securing device has been provided which is greatly simplified in opera tion in that it requires no separate actuation elements to be operated after the ski boot has been put on, since it is the very act of closing the rear quarter that will actuate the foot instep securing device. The constructional expedients described above, moreover, allow the pressure action applicable to the foot instep to be adjusted at will contingent on individual require ments. The invention as disclosed is susceptible to many modifications and changes without departing from the purview of the inventive concept. Furthermore, all of the details may be replaced with technical equivalents thereof. In practicing the invention, the materials used, as well as the dimensions and contingent shapes, may be selected ones to meet individual requirements.
