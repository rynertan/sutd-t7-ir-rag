# A fuel injection quantity adjustment apparatus for a fuel injection pump.

## Abstract
A pair of solenoids 72,74 are disposed coaxially with and around a hollow cylindrical cut off valve 68 , which includes an inner non magnetic sleeve 92 and an outer permanent magnet sleeve 94 . The cut off valve 68 slidably engages a fuel distributing plunger 48 which injects fuel according to its axial reciprocation. The cut off valve 68 serves to control the fuel injection quantity via the timing of exposure of a fuel injection cut off port 66 in the plunger 48 . When the pair of solenoids 72,74 are energized in accordance with operating parameters of the engine, the cut off valve 68 is moved to a corresponding position along the plunger 48 . A sensor 78 senses the actual position of the cut off valve 68 for feedback control thereof. A pair of disc like permanent magnets 96 may be disposed opposite either extreme of travel of the cut off valve 68 in spaced relationship thereto. A pair of non magnetic discs 98 may be disposed in place of the pair of disc like permanent magnets. A biasing member 100,110,130 may be disposed between the cut off valve 68 and the plunger housing 50 for preventing the cut off valve 68 from being attracted by the plunger housing 50 and for preventing rotation of the cut off valve 68 relative to the plunger housing 50 . The biasing member may be di aphragm 100 , coil spring 130 or a leaf spring 110 .
