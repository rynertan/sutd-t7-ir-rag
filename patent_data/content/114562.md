# Timing control mechanism for a fuel injection pump.

## Abstract
The timing control mechanism for an engine driven fuel injection pump has plungers actuated by an adjustable cam 20 . The cam 20 is adjusted by the linear displacement of a timing piston 22 operating in a cylinder 24 . A pressurized hydraulic fluid admitted to a pressure chamber 30 at one end of the cylinder 24 provides a force against one end of the timing piston 22 which is opposed by a biasing element, such as a spring 44 . A rotary servo valve 37 extends into an axial bore 46 in one end of the timing piston 22 for controlling the flow of hydraulic fluid through a control orifice 50 formed in the wall of the piston bore and connecting with the cylinder s pressure chamber 30 . The servo valve 37 is axially fixed and includes an inclined, typically helical, control edge 58 . Upon rotation of the valve 37 , as by an electric rotary stepper motor 70 , the control edge 58 effectively moves axially relative to the control orifice 50 to vary flow therethrough and thus cause the piston to track that axial positioning of the control edge 58 . The valve s control edge 58 is so positioned relative to its flow occluding surface 56 as to compensate for destabi lizing forces transmitted to the timing piston 22 through the cam 20 .
