# ELECTRICAL INSULATOR

## Abstract
A high voltage insulator that has a helical configuration in which successive turns are axially spaced apart, and an ex posed surface of insulating and substantially non tracking material. The helical configuration provides a long creepage path length and an ability to shed water. The insulator is suffi ciently rigid for it to provide a support, for example for a high voltage cable or for a fibre optic cable.
