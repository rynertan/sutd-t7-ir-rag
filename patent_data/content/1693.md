# Apparatus and method for the continuous moulding of a foamable material.

## Abstract
Below a longitudinally and vertically movable mixing head 14 there is a sloped portion of a conveyor 22 comprising a pair of stationary central panels 168 and a right and left pair of panels 188, 178 . Each pair of panels is hinged together and slide toward and away from the longitudinal axis of the central panels. A paper sheet 232 slides over the panels onto a level bottom conveyor. Vertical side fences 32 , whose distance is adjustable, are adjacent the side edges of the bottom conveyor panels. A paper sheet 35 slides along the inside surface of each side fence 32 at the same speed as the bottom sheet of paper 232 . The central panels have air passages 208 therethrough. A blower 211 is operably connected to the air passages 208 to blow air therethrough and under the paper sheet to glide the paper along the sloped conveyor.
