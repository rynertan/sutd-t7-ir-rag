# Block copolymers of diene having their terminal end blocks of a random copolymer of styrene or alkylstyrene and an alpha methylstyrene, and their preparation.

## Abstract
Block copolymers are prepared having end blocks with random copolymer of styrene and or alkyl substituted deriva tives and α methylstyrene ranges from 1 0.5 to 1 2.5, a central block of a polydiene polymer joins the terminal blocks. The block copolymers contain from 10 to 90 weight percent of polydiene, the remaining portion being of random alkylstyrene α methylstyrene copolymer. The polymers range from medium impact polystyrene type polymer of low polydiene content to thermoplastic elastomers of high polydiene content.
