# Area sensor.

## Abstract
An area sensor is provided which comprises a first group of photosensitive pixels 20₁ which are formed on a semicon ductor substrate of one conductivity type and which are ar ranged in a first two dimensional matrix form, each of the pix els of the first group inclined by 45 with respect to a horizontal direction, a second group of photosensitive pixels 20₂ which are vertically offset from the first group of photosensitive pix els by a distance corresponding to about half a vertical pixel pitch, are horizontally offset from the first group of photosensi tive pixels by a distance corresponding to a horizontal dimen sion of each pixel, and have oblique gaps between obliquely adjacent ones of the pixels arranged in the matrix forms, each pixel of the second group being inclined by 45 with respect to the horizontal direction, and a plurality of vertical registers 21 which are arranged to extend in the oblique gaps and gaps be tween vertically adjacent ones of the pixels of each of the col umns of the pixels.
