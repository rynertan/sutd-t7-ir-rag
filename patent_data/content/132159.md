# Wellhead seals.

## Abstract
A wellhead sealing system comprises a casing 12 , a tubing spool 16 and a bushing 22 between the casing 12 and the tubing spool 16 . A first recess 24 is provided in the bushing 22 and a first casing seal 23 is mounted therein to act between the bushing 22 and the casing 12 . A second recess 26 is provided in the tubing spool 16 and a first bushing seal 25 is mounted therein to act between the tubing spool 16 and the bushing 22 . The casing seal 23 has cylindrical inside 27 and outside 28 surfaces located gener ally at the inside and outside diameters of the seal 23 . The cylindrical inside surface 27 is defined by a radially inwardly extending convex central protuberance 29 and opposed cylindrical flat surface areas 30 extending axially outwardly from the convex central protuberance 29 into first transition areas 31 extending to respective end surfaces 32 . The cyc lindrical outside surface 28 is defined by a circumferential centrally located groove 33 flanked by axially outwardly extending flexible retaining flanges 34 forming second transition areas between the cylindrical outside surface 28 and the end surfaces 32 . Spring means 35 extend around the inside circumference of the seal and are located adjacent each of the first transition areas 31 .
