# Conveyor.

## Abstract
An endless path conveyor of the type used for luggage handling, having cresent shaped pallets 12 connected one to the next through pivotal connecting pins 44 by offset link arms 14 . The pivotal connecting pins have a cam roller 50 depending therefrom which engages a helical groove 33 in a screw drive means 30 which is located below the conveyor. The screw drive means is rotated by a gear motor and chain which transmits motive force to the conveyor through the cam roller. A bearing pad 60 disposed on the top of the link arm to bear on the underside of the subsequent pallet, and a lead in and lead out on the screw drive provide a smooth, quiet drive with less wearing parts and reduced maintenance.
