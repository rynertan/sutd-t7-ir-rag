## Description
The present invention relates to antigenic preparations for use in acellular vaccines against With the currently low occurrence of the disease in developed countries with immunisation programmes, the benefit risk ratio is poorly defined, and many clinicians believe that the risks of inoculation outweigh the benefits gained by immunisation. As a result, many children are not inoculated and there is then a serious risk of a pandemic of whooping cough. Considerable research effort has, therefore, been directed towards the development of improved pertussis vaccines and especially acellular vaccines which lack the components associated with the toxic effects of the whole cell vaccines hitherto used whilst incorporating those components necessary to protect against the disease. The search for a safer, effective, acellular An early extract vaccine was developed by L. Pillemer Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1950 Examples of more recent Much of the work carried out on acellular pertussis vaccines is concentrated on the possibility of basing such a vaccine on LPF. However, it is believed that most if not all of the adverse effects hitherto observed, to be associated with pertussis vaccination are related to the toxin. In combination with tetanus or diphtheria toxoid and LPS, it is able to induce experimental encephalopathy in susceptible mice L. Steinman, It has now been discovered that certain proteinaceous material, associated with adenylate cyclase activity, as hereinafter described, found in the cultures of The term proteinaceous material associated with adenylate cyclase activity abbreviated to ACAP hereinafter is used herein to refer to proteinaceous material which is extracted together with adenylate cyclase activity when extraction of the adenylate cyclase activity is performed using an aqueous, acidic pH3 solution of glycine 0.25 M . The ACAP as defined above may comprise the adenylate cyclase enzyme Adenylate cyclase activity was assayed by the method of Hewlett, E., and Wolff, J. J. Bacteriol. 1976 A feature of the present invention is to provide a vaccine formulation for protection against According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the above mentioned ACAP is proteinaceous material which is characterised as having one or more of the following properties Amino acid analysis has also shown that ACAP contains an unusually high proportion of proline, such that the proline glutamic acid ratio is about 1 1 and this feature serves to distinguish ACAP from other Accordingly the present invention provides The antigen is further characterised in having the amino acid composition set forth in Table 2. A further distinguishing characteristic of ACAP is the fact that it cannot be detected by radio iodination of its tyrosine residues by either the Chloramine T or the Iodogen methods. The ACAP in the above mentioned preparations generally has a relative molecular weight of about 67,000 to 73,000, particularly 69,000, and an isoelectric point of 7.0 7.4 under preparative conditions as described By relative molecular weight is meant the apparent molecular weight as determined by 12 w w polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and standard molecular weight markers. The molecular weight of the antigenic proteins of the invention may thus be conveniently determined by the techniques described by U.K. Laemmli, In more detail the ACAP may be detected by preparative isoelectric focussing as two bands, one having an isoelectric point pI of, about 7.0, the other diffuse band having an isoelectric point of 7.2 7.4. Adenylate cyclase activity was associated almost entirely with the neutral band pI 7.0 but monoclonal antibodies to ACAP bound both bands strongly. Under analytical isoelectric conditions, the antigen of the present invention is further characterised in having an isoelectric point of 4.5 6.0 using an agarose gel in the presence of 10 sorbitol. The above mentioned antigenic preparations for use in the vaccine formulations according to the invention may, if desired, contain minor quantities of other antigenic compounds, in addition to the ACAP, for example, materials obtained together with the ACAP extracted from the Adenylate cyclasce has been previously isolated from We have now discovered that in contrast to the use of detergents, extraction of Thus, in an alternative aspect of the present invention is provided a method for the isolation of an antigenic preparation containing ACAP from The buffer employed in the above described method preferably provides a pH of about 3 and advantageously includes a mineral acid, preferably hydrochloric acid, as the acidic component of the buffer and either glycine or alanine as the amino acid. The treatment of the cells with the buffer is preferably effected at a temperature of 5 to 50 C, preferably 30 to 45 C, ideally 37 C, advantageously for 1 to 24 hours, preferably 10 to 20 hours with an amino acid concentration of 0.1 1M, preferably 0.25M. The ACAP is acid labile and may be destroyed if the pH drops below 3 during extraction. After incubation of the cells with the buffer, the cells are discarded and the supernatant obtained after centrifugation, e.g. at about 100,000g to remove all particulate matter , is, if desired, precipitated, e.g. using ammonium sulphate, cold ethanol or acetone. The supernatant extract obtained has been tested in the Kendrick Test, as described below, and has been found to provide protection in mice against intracerebral challenge with The supernatant extract used in the Kendrick Test may, however, also contain the ACAP in small quantities complexed with other proteins including fragments of LPS, in which case, it may be desirable to purify further the material for use in the vaccine formulations according to the invention. Thus, for example, further purification may be effected by ion exchange chromatography and or by preparative isoelectro focussing to eliminate complexed material. Alternatively, the two methods of purification may be combined, i.e. the material not retained by the DEAE gel i.e. the non complexed material can be electrofocussed. The method of purification may also comprise chromatofocussing. After the above described purification steps the ACAP may, if desired, be further purified, for example, by passing the material through an immunosorbent column containing an appropriate monoclonal antibody against the ACAP. The antigenic preparations described above, including those prepared by the above described method according to the invention, may be incorporated into a vaccine formulation for inducing immunity to whooping cough in man. For this purpose the antigenic protein may be presented in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or adjuvant. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, in this instance, are liquid media suitable for use as vehicles to introduce the antigen into the patient. An example of such a carrier is saline solution. The antigenic protein may be in solution or suspended as a solid in the carrier. The vaccine formulation may also comprise an adjuvant for stimulating the immune response and thereby enhancing the effect of the vaccine. Convenient adjuvants for use in the present invention include, for example, aluminium hydroxide and aluminium phosphate. Conveniently the vaccine formulations are presented to contain a final concentration of antigenic protein in the range of from 0.01 to 5 mg ml, preferably 0.03 to 2 mg ml, most preferably 0.3 mg ml. After formulation the vaccine may be incorporated into a sterile container which is then sealed and stored at a low temperature, for example 4 C, or may be freeze dried. In order to induce immunity in man to whooping cough one or more doses of the vaccine suitably formulated may be administered. It is recommended that each dose is 0.1 to 2 ml preferably 0.2 to 1 ml, most preferably 0.5 ml of vaccine. The present invention, in a further aspect provides a method for inducing immunity to whooping cough in man, comprising the administration of an effective amount of a vaccine formulation, as hereinbefore defined, to the host. The present invention also includes the use of ACAP as defined above in the preparation of a vaccine for use in the induction of immunity to whooping cough in man. The vaccines of the present invention may be administered by any conventional method for the administration of vaccines including oral and parenteral eg. subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. The treatment may consist of a single dose of vaccine or a plurality of doses over a period of time. Vaccines according to the present invention may also comprise one or more other antigenic components such as, for example, suitably toxoided typhoid and diphtheria toxins, or other The following Examples serve to illustrate the invention The cells were harvested 3 4 of the way through exponential phase and spun down at 8000g Sorvall, GSA angle head for 20 min at 40 C. The supernatant was siphoned off and the cells were immediately gently resuspended in distilled water to a density of 20 30 mg ml dry weight of cells. One third of this volume of 1M glycine HCl buffer, pH 3.0, was added under gentle stirring to obtain a final concentration of 250 mM glycine. The glycine solution contained EDTA to obtain 5 mM in the final mixture to stop enzymatic activity. The pH was checked and, where necessary, re adjusted to pH 3.0 using 1 2 M HCl. The mixture was gently stirred in a 37 C water bath until the temperature equilibrated and then incubated overnight 18 hrs at 37 C without stirring . The pH was then adjusted to 7.2 7.4 using 10M NaOH, which was added slowly to avoid local excess. The cells were sedimented at 5000g for 20 min at 5 C , the supernatant was siphoned off, cooled in an ice water bath to 1 2 C and 2 volumes of pre cooled acetone 20 to 40 C were slowly added to avoid the temperature rising above 1 2 C. The mixture was than kept at 20 C for 3 5 hrs and the precipitate collected in a pre cooled 10 C angle head at 4000g for 20 min. The supernatant was siphoned off and discarded. The sedimented precipitate was dissolved in ice cooled distilled water to approximately 1 20 of the original volume of cell suspension. The solution was then freed of insolubles and vesicles by spinning at 5000g for 90 120 min at 5 C. The supernatant was collected and kept frozen or freeze dried. 1 w v mannitol was added before freeze drying. Forty to eighty mg protein was obtained per gram dry weight of cells. A DEAE Trisacryl column, 3 x 16 cm, was equilibrated with 0.025 M TRIS, 0.035 M NaCl buffer, pH 8.8, and the material obtained in Example 1 up to 1 g of protein dialysed against the equilibrating buffer and pumped at 60 ml hour through the column. The fractions 99 drops per tube, ca. 5 ml were combined in pools 1 13. Part of the total applied protein approx. 1 4 is not retarded by the gel bed and would be collected as a large peak Fig 1, 0.035 M . The retained material was then eluted using 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 1.0 M NaCl in 0.025 M tris buffer pH 8.8 . The fractions were pooled and applied to a SDS PAGE slab to establish the separation of proteins. The ACAP was present in the material unretarded by the column, as shown by SDS PAGE, but was also present in the retarded material eluted by 0.2 M NaCl. This was performed according to LKB recommendations Application Note 198, LKB Producter AB, Bromma, Sweden . A suspension of 4 g Ultrodex LKB and 5 ml of pre blended Ampholine, pH 3.5 9.5 were suspended in distilled water to a final volume of 100 ml, poured onto a horizontal tray 10.8 x 24.3 cm and evaporated under a flow of air to the recommended limit. Layered strips of 3 paper wicks LKB, 2117 106 soaked in 1 20 dilution of the same Ampholine in distilled water, were placed at each end of the tray. The material from Example 2a was embedded into the gel using an application template 2 x 9.4 cm which was pressed into the gel at 1 3 1 4 of the distance along its length from the anodic end, the enclosed gel removed, transferred to a 10 ml disposable syringe, suspended in 3 ml of the said material from Example 2a containing up to 500 mg protein and finally injected back into the empty space formed by its removal. The gel was then smoothed with a spatula where necessary and left to equiibrate for 20 min. Meanwhile, one paper wick was soaked in a 1 100 dilution of phosphoric acid sp.gr. 1.75, and added to the strips at the anodic end, and another in 1M NaOH and placed at the cathodic end. The tray support in the flat bed IEF apparatus Pharmacia type FBE 3000 was cooled by running tap water 15 C during the run. The gel was run at a constant 8 watts. The ACAP was detectable as two bands, one of pI 7.0, and the other diffuse band of pI 7.2 7.4. Adenylate cyclase activity was associated almost entirely with the central band pI 7.0 but monoclonal antibodies to ACAP bound both bands strongly. Using a metal template the gel bed was then divided into 30 parallel fields, the gel was scraped from each field using a spatula and transferred to test tubes containing 1 ml distilled water. The pH of each fraction was measured at this stage. The gel suspensions were then transferred into small plastic columns, eluted with 2 ml 0.2M ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.0, and the gel free eluates frozen 40 C . Mouse ascitic liquid containing a monoclonal immunoglobulin specific for ACAP was precipitated at room temperature by the addition of 2 volumes of 27 w v Na‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ and left to stand for 2 4 hrs before being sedimented 2000g for 15 min . The sediment was redissolved and dialysed against PB5. Five hundred mg of this protein UV determination was coupled to 70 ml of packed CNBr Sepharose CL4B following the manufacturer s instructions Pharmacia . Sephadex G 50 medium was applied to a 500 mm x 25 mm column to a bed height of 220 mm. After washing the column with elution buffer 0.2 M ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.0, containing 0.01 Thiomersal a 5 mm thick layer of No.12 Ballotini glass beads was poured on top of the Sephadex bed. After further washing, the immunosorbent gel was poured onto the Ballotini glass bead layer, this being separated from the Sephadex bed allowing for separation of both. The column was further washed with elution buffer, and finally another Ballotini glass bead layer was placed on top of the 100 mm high immunosorbent bed to protect the top of the column. To separate the ACAP on the immunosorbent column, 180 ml of the unretained eluate from the DEAE Trisacryl Separation Example 2 containing 1 mg ml protein Lowry , was applied at 5 C to the immunosorbent column at 0.25 ml min, washed with elution buffer 0.2 M ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7, 0.01 w v Thiomersal and, after the base line had stabilized, 50 ml 6M Urea in elution buffer was applied to the column to elute the adsorbed material. The positioning of the immunosorbent material over a Sephadex G 50 bed allowed for the simultaneous separation of the protein from urea during the run. The defined medium used for growth of the organism was based on the formula of Steiner and Scholte 1971 as previously described Novotny and Brookes, 1975 . All cultures were grown at 36 37 C. The liquid cultures, in loosely capped shake flasks 500 ml conical flask with 200 ml medium , were inoculated with a culture grown for 48 hrs on Cohen Wheeler medium with 2 agar and 5 horse blood and agitated to give a gas exchange rate of 20 40 ¬µM O‚ÇÇ hr. Such liquid cultures were used to inoculate the medium in 5 litres or 70 litres all glass fermentors, while the pH was maintained at 7.6 by the controlled addition of 2M HCl and the dissolved oxygen saturation at 5 10 by impeller agitation. The cultures were harvested before the end of the exponential phase, i.e. after approximately 36 hrs incubation Novotny and Cownley, 1978 . This was performed according to W.H.O. Requirements for Pertussis Vaccine using MF1 or NIH Mice OLAC, category 3, free of most pathogens including The amino acid analysis was carried out using a Rank Hilger Chromaspek amino acid analyser. Samples were prepared by the addition of 250 ¬µl of 6N HCl diluted from BDH Aristar grade containing 0.1 w v phenol to the dried sample material in a thick walled Pyrex test tube 7.5 x 1.2 em Tubes were then drawn out in an oxygen natural gas blow torch flame in order to produce a narrow orifice. After freezing the contents in a solid CO‚ÇÇ ethanol bath, each tube was connected via a manifold and trap to a high vacuum pump and left for ten minutes to remove air. The tubes were then sealed off and placed in an oven at 110 C for hydrolysis. The hydrolysed samples were dried in a vacuum desiccator over sodium hydroxide pellets. The dried residue was dissolved in 250 ¬µl of amino acid analyser starting buffer for automated analysis. The amino acid values shown in Table 2 are averages of the results obtained from duplicate 24, 48 and 68 hour hydrolyses except in the case of valine and isoleucine where the 68 hour hydrolysis values were used. Values for cystine, cysteine and tryptophan could not be determined by this method. Vaccines for use in immunisation may be prepared by conventional techniques with the following constituents
