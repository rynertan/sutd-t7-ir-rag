# General purpose orthogonal axes manipulator system.

## Abstract
A gantry type orthogonal axes robotic manipulator appa ratus has assemblies for causing movement in X, Y and Z axes and includes a rack and pinion mechanical drive for the X and Y axis assemblies and a ball screw mechanical drive for the Z axis assembly the apparatus employs closed loop DC servo electrical drives controlled by the conventional numerical con trol techniques. A rotary index feature permits horizontal rotation of the Y axis assembly, which supports the Z axis assembly, at the end of travel of the X axis assembly to service work zones on either side of the X axis assembly.
