# Driving device for rotatable fasteners.

## Abstract
A screwdriver comprises a handle 12 having four screwdriver blades 22, 24, 26, 28 pivotally connected adjacent one end. The blades may be pivoted from a stored position alongside the handle to an operative position in advance of the handle. A locking device locks the blade in an operative position and comprises a disc 42 rotatably mounted on the one end of the handle with a slot 48 to engage the blade. The slot has a radial portion and a circumferential position so that the blade first enters the radial portion and the disc is then rotated to hold the blade in the circumferential portion.
