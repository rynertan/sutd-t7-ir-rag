## Description
DESCRIPTION FLEXIBLE CABLE CONTROL ACTUATED ADJUSTMENT MECHANISMS. This invention relates to flexible control cable actuated remote adjustment mechanisms in which movement of an operating lever or wheel is transmitted through a cable running in a flexible conduit to an adjustment mechanism to vary the relative positioning of a movable member. The invention is of particular, but not exclusive, relevance to installations in which it is required to vary in unison the positioning of a pair of movable members over a short range of travel, such as, for example, headlights on a vehicle. Previously, mechanism for effecting remote adjustment have nSdP use of a rigid rod interconnecting the operating lever or wheel and the movable member. Whilst this has the advantage that lost motion is minimised, installation can be difficult especially if the rigid rod cannot follow a direct line. Flexible control cables have also been utilised to interconnect an operating lever or wheel and a movable member with the cable either connected directly to the movable member or to a further lever or wheel mechanism transmitting motion to the movable member. Such devices require careful installation and maintenance and are not wholly suitable for mass production. According to the present invention a flexible control cable actuated remote adjustment mechanism includes a casing, an axially movable rod extending through the casing formed at an intermediate region with an abutment for means bearing against the casing and resiliently urging the rod in an axial direction land a set of circumlerentially extending grooves, a quadrant piece having a toothed bushing positioned in the casing to mesh with the set of grooves and, remote from the toothed bushing, an anchorage for an inner wire of the flexible control cable and means for locating a conduit of the flexible control cable in relation to the casing. Desirably, the axially movable rod is connected to position a headlight of a motor vehicle. In a preferred enicdirent, means are connected automatically to effect positioning of the headlights in response to nontransient variations in the attitude of the vehicle. The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the acconpanying, partly diagrammatic, drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side elevation of a front portion of a car provided with a flexible control cable actuated remote adjustment mechanism for the car headlights Figure 2 is a plan view corresponding to Figure 1 Figure 3 is a partly sectioned elevation of the mechanism in detail indicating positioning of adjustment mechanism relative to the headlights Figure 4 is a diagrammatic representation of a flexible control cable layout for effecting automatic actuation of the adjustment mechanism Figure 5 is a portion of Figure 4 in greater detail Figure 6 is another portion of Figure 4 in greater detail and Figure 7 illustrates an alternative form of the detail of Figure 6. As shown in the drawings, a car 2 having left and right headlights 4, 6 is provided with an operating unit 8 connected by flexible control cables 10, 12 to adjustment mechanisms 14,16. With particular reference to Figure 3, the operating unit 8 includes a housing 18 moulded in reinforced acetal resin and provided with anchorage points permitting ready attachment to a suitably apertured panel adjacent the driver S position.A portion 20 of the housing facing the driver is of part cylindrical form and is moulded with a vertically extending slot 22. The housing also includes bearings 24 and seats 25 for conduit attachments 26, 28. A spade ended lever 30, moulded in acetal resin, is formed in one piece with a cable dun 34 carrying cable attacbments 36 and stub shafts 38 co acting with the bearings 24 in the housing. On assembly, the spade end of the lever is inserted through the slot 22 with the spade aligned with the slot and then the lever is rotated through 900 about the lever axis to give the operative configuration shown.The portion of the housing adjacent the bearings 24 is of a resilience permitting the stub shafts 38 and cable drum to be push fitted into position in the bearings prior to insertion into the panel aperture, the edges of which restrain subsequent deflection of the housing. A series of detents not shown are formed in the housing adjacent the slot 22 and co act with the lever 30 to restrain movement of the lever. Each adjustment mechanism 14, 16 includes a casing 40, moulded in reinforced nylon, provided with anchorage points on both side faces not shown permitting ready attachment to the car boQy adjacent the respective headlight and a casing cover 41, moulded in reinforced nylon with a spigot 43 mating with an end portion of the respective cable conduit forming a resilient, snap onj fit with the casing. The casing 40 carries a regulating rod 42, moulded in reinforced nylon, formed at one end portion with a screw threaded length 44 and, at the other end portion with flat faces 46 for receiving an adjustment tool.Adjacent the end portions the rod is formed with bearing surfaces 48 which co act with apertures 50, 51 in the casing, the aperture 51 being formed between the base of a slot in a wall of the casing 40 and a tongue 53 on the casing cover 41 edge grooved to co act with the casing wall. Intermediate the bearing surfaces the rod is formed with a collar 52 and, to either side of the collar, a series of circumferentially extending grooves 54 of toroidal form. A quadrant piece 56, moulded in acetal resin, is formed, with a toothed bushing 58, arranged to co act with the grooves 54, extending co axially of sttshafts 60 which co act with respective apertres in the casing. The end portion of the quadrant piece remote from the toothed bushing 58 is formed as a segment 62 of a cable drum and is provided with a cable attachment 64. The rod 42 is assenbled into the casing with a handing appropriate to the direction of movement required. Thus, the left hand unit 14 is assembled in the casing with the screw threaded length 44 of the rod adjacent the spigot 43 on the casing cover and a return spring 66 extending from the collar 52 toward the screw threaded length 44. Similarly the right hand unit 16 is assembled in the casing with the flat faced portion 46 of the rod adjacent the spigot 43 on the casing cover and a return spring 68 extending fran the collar 52 toward the flat faced portion 46.In both assemblies the toothed bushing 58 of the quadrant piece 56 is assembled in engagement with the series of circumferential grooves 54 remote from the spigot 43. The flexible control cables 10, 12 include respective inner wires 70, 72 and respective outer casings 74, 76. The inner wires 70, 72 respectively extend from the attachments 64 on the quadrant pieces, through the associated outer casing 74, 76 to the cable attachments 36 on the lever cable drum 34 passing to opposed sides of the cable drum. The screw threaded portions 44 are threaded into the respective headlight bodies to effect initial adjustment of the elevation of the headlight beam. In operation, by moving the lever 30 in the direction indicated by the arrow 78 the inner wire 70 is moved axially to pull the associated quadrant piece 56 of the unit 14 toward the respective spigot 43 and hence move the respective rod 42 axially to deflect the headlight 4 downwardly whilst the other quadrant piece 56 is permitted to move away from the respective spigot 43 by the effect of the return spring 68 acting through the collar 52 and the toothed bushing 58, thereby moving the associated rod 42 in the unit 16 in the same direction as the rod 42 in the unit 14 to deflect the headlight 6 dbwnwardly. If the lever 30 is moved in the opposite direction, the inner wire 72 acts to move the rod 42 in the unit 16 and the return spring 66 acts to move the rod 42 in the unit 14 to deflect the headlights 6 and 4 upwardly. Thus both rods are moved in unison either forwardly or rearwardly and both headlights deflected in unison in the same sense as the movement of the lever 30. Individual adjustment of the headlights is effected by rotation of the appropriate rod by means of an adjustment tool in engagement with the flat faces 46. In an alternative arrangement, not shown, the rod is formed with a slotted or keyed end to permit of adjustment using a screwdriver or similar tool. Alternatively, the circunferential grooves 54 may be formed as a single or multi start thread. It will be appreciated that, other than fixing to bodywork, no complex installation or adjustment is required and since the system is largely enclosed little or no maintenance is required. It will also be appreciated that the arrangement is applicable to other installations where such adjustable movement is required. It may be.utilised with but a single adjustment mechanism or with the cables acting in the same sense without departing from the nature of the invention.By suitable rearrangement of the various components the approach angle or position of the flexible cable relative to the housing 18 and the casing covers 41 may be varied to accomnodate other configurations. The casing lid may be formed with the casing, the moulding process forming a hinge region in the plastics material and the tongue 53 being modified to acocumodate the hinged action. The deflection movement of the headlights 4, 6 is linearly proportional to the movement of the lever 30, with a gearing of the order of 5 1, enabling the housing adjacent the slot 22 to be marked with calibrations related to the loading of the vehicle and corresponding to the series of detents. In a further embodiment of the invention, adjustment of the headlights is effected automatically in dependence upon the attitude of the motor vehicle, by utilising an input generated in accordance with the vertical spacing of the vehicle body relative to the front or rear or both axles. Referring to Figures 4, 5 and 6, a stabilising bar 80 linking rear wheels 82 is provided with an upright, spring steel, blade 84. The blade 84 is located in a rubber grommet 86 positioned in a stirrup 88 of a shaft 90 of a damper 92 mounted on the vehicle body. The shaft 90 passes through a flexible bellows 94 sealed to a cylinder 96 and carries a damping piston 98. A flexible control cable 100 is secured to the end of the damper 92 remote from the shaft 90 with an inner wire 102 connected to the damper piston 98.As shown in Figure 6, the end of the flexible control cable 100 remote from the damper 92 is connected into an actuator box 104 with the inner wire 102 secured to an outer sector 106 of a cable drun 134 corresponding to the cable drum 34 of the housing 18 shown in Figure 3, the inner wires 70, 72 of the flexible control cables 10, 12 shown in Figures 1 to 3 being attached to the cable drum 134. A spring not shown acting on the cable drum 134 serves to maintain the inner wire 102 in tension. In operation, non transient variations in the relative positioning between the stabilising bar 80 and the vehicle body are transmitted through the blade 84 and stirrup 88 to the inner wire 102 of the flexible control cable 100, transient variations being damped out by the damper 92. As a result, the inner wire 102 effects an appropriate rotation of the cable drum 134 to vary the deflection of the headlights through inner wires 70, 72 as hereinbefore described. In the alternative arrangement shown in Figure 7, an actuator box 204 receives input both fran the flexible control cable 100 deriving input fran the rear wheel stabiliser bar 80 and from a rod 250 mounted on a dapper piston 298 of a damper 292 having a shaft 290 connected through a spring steel blade not shown to a stabiliser bar associated with the front wheels not shown . The rod 250 is extended across the actuator box 204 to provide an attachment for the conduit 101 of the flexible control cable 102, the connection to the front wheel stabiliser bar being such that non transient upward displacement of the front wheels relative to the vehicle body is tranqmitted to the rod 250 and attachment 252 to move the conduit 101 of the flexible control cable 100 in the opposite direction to that imparted to the inner wire 102 by non transient upward movement of the rear wheels relative to the vehicle body.Thus if the front and rear wheels all move upwardly relative to the vehicle body by equal amounts there will be equal, but opposed, movement of the conduit 101 and the inner wire 102 of the flexible control cable 100 with the result that no movement will be traNsmitted to a sector 206 of a cable drum 234. However, if the amounts moved are not equal, the relative movement between the conduit 101 and the inner wire 102 will be transmitted to the cable drum 234 through the sector 206 to produce an appropriate movement of the associated inner wires 70, 72 connected to the hereinbefore described adjustment mechanisms 14, 16, to effect an appropriate deflection of the headlights 4,6. It will be appreciated that the actuator box 104 or 204 may be combined with one of the adjustment mechanism 14, 16 and that with a suitable arrangement of the adjustment mechanism the spring 66, 68 may be utilised to maintain tension in the inner wire 102 thereby pennitting the anission of the spring in the actuator box.
