# Staged anaerobic reactor.

## Abstract
An industrial waste anaerobic digestion process takes place in a digester 10 having separate sections 20, 22 within the digester, in which the acid forming and gas forming phases of the digestion process can occur separate ly under conditions optimized for each phase. A rotating biological contactor is provided in each section 22 for increasing the liquid gas interface to facilitate the anaerobic reaction. A series of partitions 26 is provided in each section to create zones in which the waste concentration is extremely high and on which the biota can react at maximal reaction rates. The COâ‚‚ produced in the acid forming phase is used in both acid and gas forming sections to mix and achieve pH adjustment, and the methane can be used in the gas forming sections for mixing. A thermophilic chamber in the center of the tank is surrounded by the mesophilic chamber to minimize and utilize conductive heat loss.
