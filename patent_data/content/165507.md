## Description
DESCRIPTION PHOSPHORIC TRIAMIDES AND POLYMERS THEREOF AS DOPANTS This invention relates to the use of phosphoric triamides as phosphorus dopants for use in semiconductor manufacture and more particularly to dopant compositions adapted to be spun on to a semiconductor substrate and used in integrated circuit manufacture. The dopant is comprised of a polymer or monomer , at least a substantial part of the backbone of which contains phosphorus nitrogen phosphoric triamide units, in the form of a glassy resin dissolved in an organic solvent. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENT ION The use of various compositions as a source of phosphorus impurity atoms for solid state diffusions in the fabrication of semiconductor devices has been known for many years. In theory, the dopant source provides improved control over dopant concentration and more uniform distribution of dopant concentrations. As a practical matter, however, these advantages have not been generally achieved heretofore to the desired practical level by the industry. This is perhaps due to insufficient need in the past or due to the nonavailability of suitable performing dopants. The concept of providing a stable liquid suspension or sq ution of phosphorus dopedJoxide or a solution of ingredients which yield a phosphorus doped oxide film, has been considered. However, commercial use of such techniques has been impeded by practical difficulties in formulating a suspension or solution which is sufficiently stable and pure, and which can be formulatedwith practical reproducibility. A dopant material to be useful, practical and perform satisfactorily must be homogeneous and soluble so that it is easily distributed uniformly on the semiconductor surface, such as by the spin on method it must be relatively non volatile so that when the solvent is removed and the material heated to diffusion temperaturn, the desired film will be substantially intact it must be capable of being rendered insoluble i.e., crosslinked thermally or otherwise and preferably characterized as glassy rather than crystalline.Accordingly, a need exists for such an economical and easily applied spin on phosphorus dopant system. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The phosphorus nitrogen dopants employed in the invention are derived from the class of materials known as phosphoric triamides or their polymers of the formulaEMI2.1 where R is selected from the group consisting of H, aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic type radicals, and X is selected from the group consisting of oxygen and sulfur and at least one R group is always either an aliphatic, cyclic or aromatic type radical and wherein n has a value of at least 2 and an upper value limited only by the requirement that the polymer be soluble under the conditions of use. Illustrat ve examples of nitrogen substituted phosphorus and thio phosphorus triamides are pO NHC2H5 3, prnNHpo NH2 2, pO NHC6H11 3, pO NH t C4119 3, pO NHprn 3, PS NHPr1 3, C6H11 NHPO NH2 2, PO NHC4H9 3, PO NHC6H5 3, PS NHC6H11 wherein the symbols prn and Pr designated n propyl and isopropyl, respectively and nt designates tertiary. The polymers of the triamides are prepared by heating the triamides to temperatures of 1500 to 3000C for a period of about one, hour to about eight hours with the elimination of volatiles.The reaction is illustrated by the following equation EMI3.1 wherein n R and n leave the values defined above. The nature of the polymer depends upon the maximum reaction temperature. Cyclic dimers such asEMI3.2 or cyclic trimers such asEMI3.3 may be formed at the lower reaction temperatures with the linear polymer formed at the higher temperatures. The formation of dimers and polymers of this kind is know and is disclosed in the prior art, for example, in U.S. Patent 2,666,750 and U.S. Patent 3,516,965 and in J.D. Healy et al. phosphorus and Sulfur 5 239 1978 and H. Bock et al. Chem. Ber. 99 377 1966 . The preparation of phosphoric trimides is also known and is disclosed for example, by L.F. Audrieth et al. J.A.C.S. 64 1553 1942 R.R. Holmes et al. Inorg. Chem. 1 89 1962 , Inorg. Chem. 2 380 1963 L. Bub et al. GermanPatent 1,005,963 and in U.S. Patent 3,433,623.However, the preparations and use of suitable dopant compositions from the described triamides and related polymers is not known. It is the object of the invention to provide novel polymeric or monomeric phosphoric triamide spin on phosphorus dopants that offer signlficant advantages. More particularly, the invention provides phosphorusnitrogen species for semiconductor dopant compositions that as diffusion sources, are not sensitive to moisture and affo d processing latitude and are not prone to create nage to and or staining of the silicon crystal substrate structure on which the dopant composition is applied Other objects and advantages will beSapparent from the description herein set forth. SCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In cD eparing the dopant composition in accordance with the invention the phosphoric triamide monomers or polymers are dissolved in suitable organic solvent, such as chlo form, toluene, ethanol, or 1,2 dichloroethane and the ike, at a I to 20 twtZwt level and spun onto silicon wafers to function as phosphorus impurity sources dopant in thermal diffusions. The doped wafers thus prepared are then used in integrated circuit manufac re. It is important that the polymer or monomer employec in accordance with the invention be homogeneous and soluble, so that it is easily distributed uniformly on the éniconductor surface, such as by the spin on method, and be relatively non volatile so that when the solvent es removed and the material heated to diffusion tempera res, the desired film will be substantially intact, and capable of being rendered insoluble, i.e. crosslinted thermally or otherwise, and preferably, oharacterized as glassy rather than crystalline. The invention provides a phosphorus nitrogen spe cies for semiconductor dopant compositions that as a diffusi source, is not sensitive to moisture and affords processing latitude and is not prone to create damage to and or staining of the silicon crystal struc ture substrate. The phosphorus nitrogen compounds used in preparing the dopants in accordance with the invention are derived from the class of materials known as phosphoric tri amides or from the polymers of phosphoric triamides and have the formulaEMI5.1 where R is selected zrom the group consisting of H, aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic radicals, X is selected from the group consisting of oxygen or sulfur and at least one R group is always an aliphatic, cyclic or aromatic radical, and n has a value of from 2 to aboút 500.Illustrative examples of nitrogen substituted phosphorus and thio phosphorus triamides of this kind are PO NHC2H5 3, PO NHC6R11 3, PO NHt C4H9 3,PrnNHPO NH2 2, PO NHprn 3, PS NHP 3r PO NHC4H9 3 PO NHC6H5 3, C6H11NHPO NH2 2, PS NHC6H11 3. The polymers of the triamides may be prepared by heating the triamides to temperatures of the order of 1500 to 3000C for a period of about one hour to about eight hours with the elimination of volatiles. The polymerization is illustrated by the linear polymers of the following equation EMI5.2 The nature of the polymer depends upon the maximum reaction temperature and reaction duration. The polymers of the invention include also polymers of this kind which contain a small amount i.e., at least 0.1 and preferably at least 0.5 weight percent of cyclic units selected from the group consisting of cyclic dimers of the formulaEMI5.3 and cyclic trimers of the formula EMI6.1 wherein R has the value given above, excluding, however, hydrogen. These polymers may be formed at the lower reaction temperatures with the linear polymer formed at the higher temperatures. The invention will be further described by the fol lowing specific examples in which phosphoric triamide compositions capable of yielding polymers that may be rendered glassy and insoluble and used as dopants are prepared. It will be understood that the details provided in the examples are given primarily for purpose of illustration and should not be construed as a limitation of the invention.

EXAMPLE XVIII Utility of the Compositions Illustrative dopant compositions were prepared from typical selections of the above prepared triamides. The product prepared in accordance with various of the foregoing examples, as noted in Table I hereafter, are solubilized in an organic solvent such as ethanol, chloroform or toluene to a 10 to 208 wt wt level and are dispensed onto the surface of a silicon wafer and the wafer rotated at 2,000 to 10,000 rpm to obtain thin films of the composition to be tested. The treated wafers, which may be held for up to 24 hours, are placed in a diffusion furnace and the wafer diffused under a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature of 10000C for 1 hour to achieve sheet resistivities of 3.9 to 13 ohms per square. The results are given in Table I below. While in the above example no oxygen was used in the diffusion furnace, we have found the addition of up to 30 oxygen in the furnace does not adversely effect doping performance, and may improve the wafer surface condition.
