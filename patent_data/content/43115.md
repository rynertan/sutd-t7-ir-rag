## Description
DESCRIPTION The present invention relates generally to a seat belt device for an automotive vehicle, and more particularly to the arrangement of a seat belt device such that a retractor is fixed near. one corner of the seat frame and a belt guide member is provided near the other corner of the seat frame. The background of the present invention will be explained with respect to its application to the seat belt device used with an automotive vehicle. As is well known, there are various safety seat belt devices used in automotive vehicles so as to protect a driver or passengers seated within the passenger compartment from injury caused by shock when the vehicle is suddenly decelerated, in an emergency situation suct as a collision. Normally, the seat belt can be reeled out easily from a retractor by the driver or passenger and is pulled toward the retractor so that the seat belt may be brought into contact with the body of the driver under appropriate tension. In the case where an automatic locking retractor is provided for the seat belt device, the seat belt is locked or stopped from being further reeled out from the retractor in case an extraordinary shock is delivered to the retractor.This is because an inertiasensitive sensor can detect the shock and lock the seat belt so that the seat belt can be prevented from being further reeled out from the retractor. In this prior art seat belt device, however, since the retractor is placed under almost the center of the seat, in the case of a car model where there is insufficient clearance under the seat, there is a problem in that the driver or the passenger is not comfcrtable when the seat bottom is brought into contact with the retractor. In addition to the above, since the retractor occupies the space under the seat, the passenger taking the rear seat cannot stretch his legs freely under the front seat. The arrangement of the prior art seat belt device will be described in detail hereinafter with reference toFigs. 1 and 2 under DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERREDEMBODIMENTS.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION With these problems in mind, therefore, it is the primary object of the present invention to provide a seat belt device such that the bottom of the seat cushion does not interfere with the retractor and additionally enough space is formed under the seat so that the passenger taking the rear seat can freely stretch his legs thereunder. To achieve the above mentioned object, the seat belt device according to the present invention comprises a retractor disposed near a corner of the seat frame and a seat belt guide member disposed near the other corner of the seat frame. The features and advantages of the seat belt device according to the present invention will be more clearly appreciated from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals designate corresponding elements and in which Fig. 1 is a perspective pictorial view of a seat provided with a prior art seat belt Fig. 2 is an enlarged cross sectional view ofFig. 1, taken along the lines A A Fig. 3 is a perspective pictorial view of a seat provided with a first embodiment of the seat belt device according to the present invention Fig. 4 is an enlarged fragmentary plan view of a seat frame used with the first embodiment of the seat belt device according to the present invention of Fig. 3 Fig. 5 is a side view seen from the lines B B ofFig. 4 Fig. 6 is an enlarged fragmentary plan view of a seat frame used with a second embodiment of the seat belt device according to the present invention and Fig. 7 is a cross sectional view of Fig. 6, taken along the lines C C. To facilitate understanding of the present invention, a brief reference will be made to a prior art seat belt device, with reference to the attached drawings. Figs. 1 and 2 show a seat provided with a sample prior art seat belt device including a retractor fixed under the seat. In the figures, the reference numeral 1 denotes the floor of the vehicle body, the numeral 2 denotes a seat cushion slidable frontward or backward, and the numeral 3 denotes a belt. A retractor 4 to pull one end of the belt 3 thereinto is disposed within a frame 5 provided under the seat cushion 2, as depicted in Fig. 2, and the belt 3 is reeled out upward over the seat through a guide member 6.The numeral 7 denotes a lower seat sliding rail fixed on the floor 1, the numeral 8 denotes an upper seat sliding rail fixed to the seat, the numeral 9 denotes a seat spring arranged under the seat cushion 2, the numeral 10 denotes a pad placed on the spring 9, and the numeral 11 denotes a trim cover. In this prior art seat belt device, however, since the retractor 4 is placed under almost the center of the seat cushion 2, in the case of a car model where it is difficult to have enough clearance between the floor 1 and the seat spring 9, there is a problem in that the driver or the passenger is not comfortable when the seat spring 9 is brought into contact with the retractor 4 as shown by the dashed line 9 in Fig. 2. In addition to the above shortcomings, there is another shortcoming such that since the retractor 4 occupies the space under the center of the seat cushion 2, the space between the floor 1 and the seat spring 9 is reduced and therefore it is impossible for the passenger taking the rear seat to stretch out his legs freely under the front seat. In view of the above description, reference is now made to a first embodiment of the seat belt device according to the present invention. Fig. 3 shows a seat provided with a first embodiment. In this embodiment, a retractor 17 is disposed near the lower, front, middle side with respect to the passenger compartment corner of a seat cushion 14. That is to say, as shown in Fig. 4, an unoccupied space 16 is formed near the front, middle side corner of the seat frame 15 to mount the seat cushion 14, and a retractor 17 is fixed in this space 16. The upper rail 18 of Fig. 5 is fixed to the bottom surface of the retractor 17 under the frame 15 on the middle side of the passenger compartment. In this embodiment, the numeral 19 denotes a lower rail fixed on the floor 1, and the numeral 20 denotes two balls disposed between the upper rail 18 and the floor rail 19. As depicted in Fig. 4, an opening 22 from which to reel the belt 21 out from the retractor 17 is provided facing rearward, and the seat belt 21 also extends rearward along the side surface of the frame 15 toward the center of the passenger compartment. At the rear part of the frame 15, a belt guide member 23 with a guide slot 23a is fixed on the side toward the center of the passenger compartment to guide the belt 21 upward as shown in Fig. 3. In the seat belt device thus constructed, since the seat spring 9 is not brought into contact with the retractor 17, as shown by the dashed line 9 in Fig. 5, even if the seat spring 9 deforms downward when the driver or passenger sits down on the seat cushion 14, the driver can take the seat comfortably without feeling the presence of the retractor 17, and additionally since the seat belt 21 extends along the middle side surface of the frame 15, it is possible to reel the belt out from or pull it into the retractor without interfering with the seat spring 9. Further, since there is enough space under the center of the frame 15, it is possible for the passenger taking the rear seat to stretch his legs out freely under the front seat. Figs. 6 and 7 show a second embodiment of the seat belt device according to the present invention. In this embodiment, the retractor 17a is disposed near the lower, front, middle side corner of the seat frame 15a on which the seat cushion 14 is mounted, a skew guide slot 23a to guide the seat belt 21 is provided on the front, outer side of the seat frame, and another slotshaped grommet type guide member 23b to prevent the belt from being displaced from the seat frame is attached covering the guide slot 23a therewith. In this embodiment, it would be preferable to provide a roller in place of the guide member 23b for further reducing the friction between the seat belt and the frame. Further, in this embodiment, although the retractor is disposed at the front, middle side corner of the seat frame 15a, it is possible to dispose it at the rear part of the seat frame. As described above, since the retractor is disposed near the lower, front, middle side corner of the seat frame and the seat belt guide member is fixed at a position near the other corner of the seat frame, the driver or passenger can take the seat comfortably without feeling the presence of the retractor and the other passenger taking the rear seat can freely stretch his legs under the front seat. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing description is in terms of preferred embodiments of the present invention wherein various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as is set forth in the appended claims.
