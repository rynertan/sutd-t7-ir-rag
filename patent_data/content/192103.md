## Description
C i4VEYIi4G Ut8IT WITH INCORPORATED REDUCTIO J GEAR, FOR TAPIk G PACKAGINGMACHINES The present invention concerns a packaging machine, and more precisely a machine for applying an adhesive sealing tape on packaging boxes, so called taping machine. It is known that in machines of this type means are provided to convey the boxes along a roller table, in an intermediate position of which the boxes are sealed by applying adhesive tape. Such conveying means which particularly concern the present invention generally comprise at least one endless belt, sliding on two transmission rollers at least one of which is motor driven and having a rough surface, apt to convey the boxes by friction. Generally as described, for instance, in the US A 3894380 the two transmission rollers are mounted at the ends of an elongated boxlike support body, having two lateral faces which are substantially tangent, on diametrically opposite sides, to the periphery of the two transmission rollers, so that the belt can slide resting on said faces on the rectilinear path between the two rollers. The motor driven roller is operated by means of an electric motor having its own reduction gear, the output shaft of which is usually connected directly to the shaft of the motor driven roller. For this purpose, the motor and reduction gear are mounted directly onto said boxlike support body. This arrangement has a double drawback on one hand, the motor and reduction gear unit is considerably bulky and this can cause problems in a relatively small machine, as the taping machine of the type mentioned above on the other hand, said unit which is quite heavy, as well as bulky, and which is mounted projecting from said elongated boxlike body produces on the body torsional stresses which are by no means desirable. The object of the present invention is to realize a conveying unit for taping machines of the abovementioned type, which eliminates the aforecited drawbacks thanks to a very simple and compact structure which is also economic. This result is obtained mainly due to the fact that the driving motor is mounted directly on said elongated boxlike body and that a reduction gearing is housed inside said boxlike body. Further characteristics and advantages of the device according to the present invention will anyhow be more evident from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof, illustrated by way of example on the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic longitudinal part section view of an elongated boxlike body supporting the transmission rollers and of the motor unit and respective reduction gearing and Fig. 2 is a diagrammatic cross section view. As shown, the conveying unit according to the present invention comprises an elongated boxlike body 1, of which only the upper wall Ia and the lower wall Ib are shown in figure 1. The two ends of said body 1 carry two transmission rollers 2, mounted by means of respective shafts 3 and rotating on bearings 4 fixed to the waIts la and ib to simplify things, the drawing only shows one of said rollers 2, namely the motor driven roller, the other roller being identical and mounted idle at the other end of the body 1. An endless belt 5 is mounted on the rollers 2, said belt being preferably provided with a toothed rib 5a for engagement with a corresponding toothed groove 2a of the rollers 2. Between the two transmission rollers 2, the two lengths of the belt 5 run parallel, in contact with the side walls ic and Id of the elongated boxlike body 1. According to the present invention, the driving motor M is mounted directly on the upper wall Ia of the body 1, by fastening means knoun per se and thus not shown, the driving shaft 6 of said motor shortly projecting within the body 1. According to a preferred arrangement of the present invention, inside the body 1 there are mounted first gear 7 splined to the shaft 6, a gear pair 8 and 9 rotating on a common shaft 10, and a further gear 11 splined to a shaft 12 the shaft 10 is fixed to the wall la, while the shaft 12 is mounted idle on the wall 1b of the body 1. Two preferably toothed drive belts 13 and 14 connect the gears 7, 8 and 9, 11 respectively. The shaft 12 moreover projects from the wall ib with an end 12 to which is splined the additional gearwheel 15, meshing with a chain 16 which drives the gearwheel 17, this latter being splined to the end 3 of the shaft 3 projecting from the same wall Ib. As it appears evident, the described motion transmission allows to obtain a reduction of the motion transmitted by the motor M, in the ratio attained through the gears 7, 8, 9, 11, 15 and 17. It can be easily understood that the heretofore described conveying unit structure provides obvious advantages first of all, the fact that only the motor H is fixed on the outer part of the body 1 determines a reduction in the overall external dimensions and in the cantilevered or projecting weights moreover, the weight of the gearbox unit is totally eliminated, as the gears of said unit are housed directly into the body 1 finally, also the position of the motor M is no longer constrained as in the past to one of the ends of the body 1 in correspondence of the shaft 3 of one of the transmission rollers, but it can be set at will along the length of said body 1, as the transmission inside the body 1 can be housed in any desired position, with obvious advantages in respect of the planning last of all, although in the illustrated arrangement the transmission comprises a gear pair 15, 17, mounted externally to the body 1, nothing forbids to house said transmission completely inside the body 1, by providing for instance a gear apt to mesh directly with the toothed groove 2a of the roller 2.
