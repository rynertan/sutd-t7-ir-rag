# Conductive coatings and foams for anti static protection, energy absorption, and electromagnetic compatibility.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a conductive coating composition comprising, by weight of the composition a 5 to 50 percent total element carbon b 2 to 50 percent of a polymeric binder c 5 to 93 percent of a solvent and d 0 percent to 5 percent of a surfactant wherein substantially all of the total elemental carbon, by weight of the elemental carbon, is a ground coal based, calcined coke having an Ec value of 27 to 80. Alternatively 5 to 95 percent of the total elemental carbon, by weight of the elemental carbon, is a ground coal based calcined coke having an Ec value of 27 to 80. Such compositions are useful in protecting electronic components from damage by stray electrostatic discharge when applied to a surface in close proximity with the components.
