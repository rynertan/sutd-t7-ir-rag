# MANUALLY POSITIONABLE CORRECTION MEDIA HOLDING AND DISPENSING APPARATUS FOR A TYPEWRITER

## Abstract
A cardholder 12 of a single element moving carriage typewriter may be modified to accept and accurately position a manually insertable and removable correction media holder and dispenser 10 with respect to the print point of the typewriter so that a correction operation may be performed for correcting erroneously typed characters. The correction media holder and dispenser 10 is configured to mate in a precise condition with the modified cardholder 12 and to support a supply spool 24 and a take up spool 20 of correction media 26 as well as to cause the deflection of the correction media 26 as it traverses across the region of the print point to present the active or operative face of the correction media to a printed page.
