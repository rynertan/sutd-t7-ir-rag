# A semiconductor device and a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A first polycrystal semiconductor layer 53L₁ which is rela tively heavily doped is provided and a second polycrystal semiconductor layer 57R which is relatively lightly doped is also provided, Where the second polycrystal semiconductor layer 57R contacts the first polycrystal semiconductor layer 53L, or a relatively heavily doped region of a substrate 51 for example regions 54D and 54L₁ upward diffusion of impurities from the relatively heavily doped parts to the second poly crystal semiconductor layer is provided, Thereby, ohmic con tacts with the second polycrystal semiconductor layer 57R can be made, whilst the general light level of doping of the second polycrystal semiconductor layer 57R can be selected so that that layer provides a resistor of a selected value, The first polycrystal semiconductor layer is used for electrodes and wirings for active elements of the device.
