# A vapor phase method of growing a semiconductor compound.

## Abstract
In an example of the vapor phase epitaxy VPE method of a compound semiconductor, a high resistivity GaAs buffer layer and a low resistivity GaAs active layer are successively grown on a GaAs substrate. It is, however, difficult in the conventional VPE methods to provide the buffer layer with a high resistivity, due to contamination of impurities deposited on the VPE reaction tube 1 . It is also difficult in the conventional VPE methods to provide the interface between the compound semiconductor layers with an abruptly changing doping profile. In accordance with the VPE method of the present invention, a dummy GaAs substrate 5 having a crystallographic orientation different from that of the GaAs substrate 3 is positioned just above and opposite to the GaAs substrate 3 , thereby decreasing the epitaxial growth rate on the GaAs substrate 3 and thus eliminating the problems of the conventional methods. Advantageously, the yield of the VPE method is enhanced and the noise figure of the FETs is decreased by the present invention.
