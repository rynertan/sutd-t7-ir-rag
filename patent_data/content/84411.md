## Description
The present invention relates to methods of cleaning oil rock mixtures in oil drilling operations and especially to cleaning of drilling oil from rock cuttings on offshore drilling rigs, removal of oil from the face of newly drilled holes prior to reinforcement with casing, and to the cleaning of oil muds from drilling rigs. In the process of drilling for oil and gas, it is necessary for a number of reasons, to use a drilling fluid or drilling mud.The types of drilling fluid at mud in common use are a water based. b oil based. c water in oil emulsion based. invert . Oil based drilling media b may also contain water in the form of water in oil emulsion. it is customary in the art to refer to a drilling medium containing up to about 15 aqueous phase by volume as oil based. Those drilling media referred to as invert fluids or muds, c generally contain between 15 and 55 water.This patent application is particularly concerned with types b and c both of which are included in the term oil as used herein, together with crude and refined mineral oils. One of the functions of drilling fluid is to carry drill cuttings from the drill bit to the surface, the cuttings are then removed by physical techniques, for example, by using shale shakers, screens, cyclones, and centrifuges. After removal of the cuttings the drilling fluid is re used and the cuttings are disposed of. If the drilling is offshore then the cuttings are disposed of into the sea, where in the case of aqueous drilling fluids the cuttings disperse and settle without causing significant problems.However, in the case of oil drilling fluids the cuttings are oil wet and settle rapidly to the sea bed below the drilling rig and form an oily, sticky mass, which can interefere with drilling operations, for example, by hindering the movement of divers involved in sub sea construction and maintenance work. It is thought that the swelling of clays ifl the cuttings is responsible for the formation of this mass. In addition, the cuttings cause oil pollution through gradual release of the oil. One technique to remove oil from cuttings is to wash the cuttings with a solvent such as diesel, this has the effect of removing most of the oil but still leaves the surface contaminated with hydrocarbons, which can gradually be released to the environment. Another way is to use a water rnscible solvent, such as a glycol ether, but these are expensive. Yet another way is to wash the cuttings in sea water using good agitation to dislodge t .e oil from the surface of the cuttings. This process. can be used either as the sole process for removing the drilling oil from the cuttings, or as a second step to remove an oil solvent from cuttings previously washed with a hydrocarbon.This process can be improved by adding a surfactant to the sea water, to lower the oil water interfacial tension. The cuttings may then be discharged to the sea where they disperse and settle over a wide area of sea bed rather than accuriulate directly in the area of the drilling operations.The oil in water emulsion which is formed as a result of washing the cuttings may be discharged to the sea where fine dispersion of the oil will facilitat its breakdown by micro organisms. A commonly used surfactant for the foregoing purposes is a C9 11 alconol six mole echoxylat . An object of the pr invention is to provide more effective methods of cleaning oil frcm rock cuttings. A further object of our invention is to provide a method whereby oil can be separated from the emulsion resulting from cleaning of the cuttings. We have discovered that a particular blend of an ethoxylated nonionic surfactant with an alkanolamide exhibits a synergistic effect permitting the more efficient cleaning of oil from rock cuttings. We have further discovered according to a preferred embodiment of our invention that when the emulsions of oil in water formed by cleaning according to our invention are heated, the emulsion is readily broken and the oil may then be recovered. Accordingly, our invention provides a method of cleaning which comprises contacting an oil coated rock with an aqueous solution containing an affective amount of a mixture of A from 5 to 95 by weight of at least one alkoxylated alcohol, carboxylic acid, alkylphenol, or nonionic phosphate ester, having in each case at least one alkyl group with from 6 to 22 carbon atoms and from 1 to 20 ethyleneoxy groups, with 3 from 95 to 5 by weight of at least one alkanolamide of the formula EMI3.1 wnerein R is a saturated or unsaturated alkyl grou , having from 5 to 17 carbon atoms and x and y are eacn chosen from 0 and integers from 1 to 12, such tat x y is from 1 to t Preferably A is primary straight or branched chain alcohol having from. Ï to 18 carbon atoms and alkoxylated with from 1 to 10 ethyl ene oxy groups. A may alternatively be normal or branched chain al xanoic or alkenoic acid having from 7 to 23 carbon atoms, alkoxylated with from 1 to 10 ethylene oxy groups straight or branched chain alkyl phenol with from 6 to 12 aliphatic carbon atoms, alkoxylated with from 1 to 12 ethylene oxy groups nonionic phosphoric acid ester having at least one straight or branched chain alkyl group with from 6 to 22 carbon atoms, at least one alkoxy or polyalkoxy group with from 1 to 20 ethylene oxy units. B typically has from 1 to 4 ethyleneoxy groups. While me have discovered that monoethanolamides are particularly effective synergists, and may be preferred for use in warm climates, concentrated mixture of monoethanolamide with component A tend to be insufticiently fluid at low temperatures for convenient handling under the conditions which may be encountered in, for example, North Sea operations. For such low temperatures Ne prefer to use diethanolamides. Typically, a mixture of A and 8 is supplied as a concentrate which is dissolved in, or diluted with, water to provide the cleansina solution at the site of the rig. Such conc2ntrates optionally contain a solvent such as water or a water miscible alcohol, glycol or glycol ether, e.g. isopropanol, ethylene glycol propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, as required to provide a fluid, pourable composition under the conditions likely to be encountered. The concentrate may, additionally, contain minor proportions of hydrotropes, such as alkaline earth, sOdium potassium mono di or tri alkyl benzene sulphonate salts having less than six aliphatic carbon atoms, e.g. toluene or xylene sulphonates, phosphate esters salts, preservatives, such as formal in, dyes and or perfumes.Water may be present in any convenient proportion between zero and the final working concentration of the cleaner. Generally, the lower the proportion of the water the greater the convenience for transport and storage of the concentrate. These considerations however must be balanced against the preference for a stable, pourable composition. Organic solvents can add appreciaby to the cost of the composition and are preferably, therefore used sparingly e.g. less than 50 and preferably less than 20 of the weight of the concentrate. The concentrate may typically contain from 5 to 95 by weight of A and from 95 to 5 by weight of 8. Preferably however A is present in concentrations greater than 10 by eight, most preferably greater than 20 and usually greater than 30, 8 is also preferably present in osnoentrations of greater than 10 y weight, more preferably greater than 20 and usually greater than 30. A suitable mixture contains from 40 to 50 or A , from 6O to 40 of B and from 0 to 20 of solvent. The concentrate is dissolved or dispersed in water at the site of application. When used at offshore locations, the concentrate may conveniently be dissolved or dispersed in sea water. Typically, the concentrate is diluted to from 0.5t to 10 active matter by weight preferably from 1 to 6. We do not exclude higher concentrations, but they are unlikely to prove cost effective.Concentrations below O.5 are r.ot excluded but are only marginally effective. When used to clean rock cuttings , the cuttings are preferably agitated with the solution of the concentrate in water or brine, for a sufficient time to emulsify a substantial proportion of the oil. The emulsion may then be separated from the cuttings which, when sufficiently clean, are dumped. The emulsion may be discharged. However, according to a preferred embodiment of our invention the oil is recovered from the emulsion by moderate heating. Typically temperatures in excess of 0 C e.g. 50 to 700C are sufficient to break the emulsion and permit recovery of the separated oil phase. The cleaning solution according to our invention may also be injected into bore holes to clean oil from the sides of the rock. This is necessary When a casing is to be bonded with cement to the sides of the bore hole. The solution may also be used according to our invention to clean oil mud from the rigs themselves and generally 5 remove viscous hydrocarocn oils from nard surfaces. The solution will be illustrated by the follwoing examples The products were tested as follcws Cuttings Wash Test Method a 43 grams of oil mud cuttings obtained from a North Sea drilling operation were added to 150g of X active matter surfactant solution in synthetic sea water.b This was stirred for 5 minutes using a JankedKunkel stirrer at setting 2 at 800 rpm. c The mixture was allowed to stand for five minutes after which time the liquid was decanted. This liquid contained the emulsified oil which could be separated by warming to above 400C. d The mixture was then made up to 150 ml with standard sea water and stirred for a further minute as in b .e The mixture was then filtered through two layers of muslin.r 20g of washed cuttings were weighed accurately Wl into a 25C ml round bottomed flask and the water content was determined by the Dean and Stark method using 100 120 petroleum ether. The weight of water removed was determined as W2.g A further 10g of the washed cuttings were accurately weighed W3 into an evaporating dish and dried to constant weight W4 at 110 C .The weight of oil cn the cuttings,EMI7.1 The weight of oil left on the cuttings expressed as a percentage of weight of dry cuttings weight of oilW0 W5 x 100 W4 W5 The test was performed in duplicate. It should be noted that we have found that the amount of oil removed from the surface of cuttings by any given surfactant or blend of surfactants is dependent on the age of the cuttings, more oil being removed from fresh cuttings than from aged cuttings.
