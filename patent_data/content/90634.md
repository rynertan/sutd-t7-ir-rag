# MULTILAYER CERAMIC DIELECTRIC CAPACITORS

## Abstract
End terminations for multilayer ceramic dielectric capaci tors, particularly but not exclusively metal impregnated capa citors, are provided by bonding a coarse ceramic powder, which is lightly coated with silver, to the capacitor ceramic by means of a glass frit whereby to produce a porous pseudo end termination containing insufficient silver to provide a good contact to the capacitor electrodes. The exposed silver in the pseudo end termination is then provided with a silver sulphide layer and subsequently the pseudo end termination is im pregnated with lead. The end termination thus formed is com prised substantially of lead, which is held in place by the silver sulphide layer, that is wetted by the lead, on the bonded ceramic powder, and are thus low cost and readily solderable.
