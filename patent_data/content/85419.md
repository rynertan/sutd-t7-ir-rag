# Process and compound bed means for evolving a first component enriched gas.

## Abstract
Parallel columns 10a, 10b of gas adsorbent beds produce an effluent gas enriched in a first component of a feed gas. Each column consists of the serial arrangement of a first bed 12, 14 of molecular sieve material selective of the first component, a plenum 16, 18 and a second bed 20, 22 of molecular sieve material selective of a second component of the feed gas. During one column pressurization, the beds of the other column are regenerated. More particularly, gas evolved from the second bed of the pressurized column is counterflowed through the second bed of the other column to the plenum of that column where it is subsequently mixed with feed gas and used as feed for the first bed of that column.
