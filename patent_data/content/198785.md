## Description
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for mounting a plate like structure on a shaft, and is more particularly concerned with a method and apparatus for installing a refining head and a shaft of a high consistency refiner. In a high consistency refiner, the fit of the shaft to a large refining head must be controlled to ensure proper interference for transmitting large amounts of torque and to maintain a required squareness of the refining surfaces. The amount of interference must also be adequate to account for the enlargement of the bore of the refiner head due to centrifugal forces at running speeds. Heretofore, the fit has been provided during refiner manufacturing in two ways. In the first technique, a straight fit was employed with a calculated amount of interference fit and a key keyway engagement. A shoulder at the end of the fit also controlled the axial placement of the head on the shaft. The primary problem with this method is that removal of the refiner head from the shaft, as required by normal maintenance procedures, becomes very difficult. The outer rim of the refiner head must be heated in order to expand the bore of the head away from the shaft. It is difficult to determine when the desired clearance has been reached to promote removal of the refiner head with this type of procedure. Therefore, many problems have been encountered in which the head has become stuck to the shaft, gauling the two surfaces, and making removal almost impossible without causing irreparable damage to the assembly. The second procedure is to use a tapered fit of the refiner head and shaft. A problem then arises as how to determine the proper amount of interference. An insufficient amount of interference may cause the head to lose its surface squareness or become loose during running conditions, therefore causing a safety hazard. Too much interference may cause problems during disassembly of the parts, similar to that for the straight fit. Methods for properly installing a refiner head have varied from one manufacturer to another however, a fail safe method for properly locating the refiner head with respect to a known interference has not been developed. Most methods recommend exerting a known force against the head in the axial direction, using a large hydraulic jack. However, given the wide variation of static friction coefficients, for example 0.78 dry to 0.0051 greasy , for steel on steel as specified in Mark s Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers, 8th Ed. , large differences in resultant interferences can occur using this method. The object of the present invention is to provide a method and an apparatus for properly installing a refiner head, having a tapered bore, on a mating shaft, having a tapered section. According to the invention, a circumferentially mounted strain gauge is provided on an internal surface within a recess in a head bore, which, when attached to a strain indicator, reads the hoop strain of the refiner head, and subsequently the amount of interference between the shaft and the refiner head, as the shaft and the refiner head are pressed together. This technique provides a precise amount of assembly interference of these two parts. More specifically, the above solution utilizes a circumferentially mounted strain gauge on a small relief or recess in the bore of the refiner head. The strain gauge measures hoop strain which may be related to the average amount of interference between the two parts. The operation of the press fitting of the refiner head onto the refiner shaft causes the bore of the refiner head to increase and the diameter of the shaft to shrink. These changes in dimension show up as strain in the material which may be directly measured with a strain gauge. The relationship between the amount of measured circumferential or hoop strain and the desired amount of interference fit may be expressed as ε Other objects, features and advantages of the invention, its organization, construction and operation will be best understood from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, on which Referring to Fig. 1, a refiner head 10 is illustrated mounted on a refiner shaft 12. The refiner head 10 includes a tapered bore 14 and the refiner shaft 12 comprises a complementary shaped end 16. The bore 14 comprises an annular recess 18 in which, as best seen in Fig. 2, two strain gauges 20 and 22 are diametrically mounted. As seen in Fig. 1, the strain gauge 20 is connected by way of electrical conductors 24 to a strain indicator 30, such as may be provided by Northern Technical Service, Inc., Model 5210 Digital Strain Indicator. Alternatively, the strain gauge 22 could be so connected by way of conductors 32. The conductors extend through a pair of intersecting bores 26,28 in the refiner head 10. The strain for a refiner head having bore of 20.32 cm 8 inches , will be, for example , 100 x 10 ⁶ cm cm 100 microstrain or 100 x 10 ⁶ . As seen, the refiner head may be lifted up to the level of the shaft by way of a hoist attached to a removable element 34. A hydraulic ram 36 comprises a hydraulic cylinder 38 and an extensible retractable member 40 and serves for the application of pressure to the refiner head 10 with respect to the shaft 12. As shown, the extensible retractable member 40 has an enlarged distal end with a shoulder 42 which bears against a shoulder 44 of a cap like structure 46 which is secured to the end face of the shaft 12 by way of a plurality of screws 48. Therefore, as pressure is applied to retract the shaft 40, the extensible member 42 applies a pulling force to the end of the shaft 12. At the same time, the forward face 50 of the cylinder 38 acts against the end face 52 of the refiner head 10 by way of a pressure element 54 which includes a bore 56 receiving the extensible retractable member 40 therethrough. As shown in Fig.1, a threaded rod 58 is secured to the refiner disk 10 and to a plate 60 and supports the left hand end of the cylinder 38. The pressure element 54 all includes a bore 62 which receives a radial projection 64 connected to the element 46. An axial displacement gauge 66 is mounted between the projection 64 and the end face of the refiner disk 10 and will provide a reading of axial displacement for which, for example, Turning now to Fig. 3, the method of installing a refiner head according to the present invention is illustrated. As indicated, the tapered section of the shaft is coated with a light film of machine oil either before or after the refiner head has been lifted to the level of the shaft. The refiner head is then positioned on the shaft, the strain gauge is connected and the ram and distance gauge are put in place and connected. During the next step, a pressure of 7.03 kg cm² 100 P.S.I. is applied by the ram to set the refiner head on the shaft. Next, the axial displacement gauge 66 is set to zero and the pressure is then increased to establish a 0.813 mm 0.032 axial travel of the refiner head with respect to the shaft. The pressure is then again increased while the strain indicator 30 is read to establish a predetermined strain on the head, such as the 100 x 10 ⁶ cm cm 100 microstrain mentioned above. After reaching the predetermined strain, the pressure is maintained for a predetermined time interval, for example 15 minutes, to squeeze out the film of oil. The strain gauges may be affixed by epoxy or, preferably, by welding. Two strain gauges have been provided in the illustration of Fig. 2 as a redundant installation in case one strain gauge becomes damaged. However, two strain gauges may be read or, for example, four strain gauges may be provided in diametrically opposed pairs and connected in a bridge configuration for reading by the strain indicator. When a single strain gauge is connected to the strain indicator a standard one quarter bridge connection is employed as illustrated in Fig. 1. After installation of the refiner head , the conductors are disconnected from the strain indicator and stuffed into the bore 28 which is then plugged with a threaded plug 70. Although we have described our invention by refe rence to particular illustrative embodiments thereof, many changes and modifications of the invention may become apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. We therefore intend to include within the patent warranted hereon all such changes and modifications as may reasonably and properly be included within the scope of our contribution to the art.
