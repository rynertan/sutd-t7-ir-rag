# Valves, especially for a tubing string.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a valve which can be easily operated by an actuator member 39 which can be released or utilised for other functions. Spaced apart dogs 26, 37 carried by the valve member 31 are resiliently biassed to alternately cooperate with one of two spaced apart grooves 32, 33 provided in the valve body 23 , to position the valve member 31 alternately in an open and a closed position. Confronting shoulders 36b, 37b of the dogs 36, 37 are engageable by a flange 38 on the actuator member 39 when a dog 36, 37 is retracted from a groove 32, 33 , to thus shift the valve member 31 with reciprocation of the actuator member 39 . Each of the dogs 36, 37 releases the actuator member 39 as the dog 36, 37 enters its cooperating groove 32, 33 . Thus the valve can be remotely operated without requiring a permanent connection to a remote location e.g. well head.
