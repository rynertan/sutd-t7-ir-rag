# IMPROVED PROCESS FOR REMOVING PYROGENS UTILIZING A HYDROPHOBIC MICROPOROUS MEMBRANE

## Abstract
There is disclosed an improved process for removing pyro gens from a feed liquid which is water or an aqueous solution containing the pyrogens, at a concentration in the range of from 0.1 to 50 ng ml, comprising the steps of contacting the feed side of a specified hydrophobic microporous membrane with the feed liquid, allowing the liquid to pass through the membrane, and recovering the liquid from the filtrate side of the membrane, these steps being terminated before the membrane becomes saturated with pyrogens. There is also disclosed an improved process for simultane ously removing pyrogens and particulate matter from a feed liquid which is water or an aqueous solution containing the particular matter and containing the pyrogens, at a concentration in the range of from 0.1 to 50 ng ml, comprising the steps of contacting the feed side of a specified hydrophobic microporous membrane with the feed liquid, allowing the liquid to pass through the membrane, and recovering the liquid from the filtrate side of the membrane, these steps being terminated before the membrane becomes saturated with pyrogens. The membrane used in the processes of the present invention is characterized by being made of polypropylene, being substantially skinless, and having a a bubble point in the range of from 25 to 50 psi b a thickness in the range of from 3 to 7 mils c a nitrogen flow rate of at least 0.5 litres per square cen timetre minute d a burst strength of at least 10 psi and e an S value of about 15, or less.
