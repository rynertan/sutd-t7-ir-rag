# Dark colored freeze dried coffee.

## Abstract
A dark colored freeze dried coffee is produced by using a multi step process to freeze the coffee extract. The coffee extract is chilled to a temperature at which an ice slush forms. The slushed extract is heated in order to melt some of the slush and subsequently re chilled. This proce dure may be repeated one or more times prior to chilling the extract below its eutectic point and freeze drying the frozen extract.
