# Fibrous media containing millimicron sized particles.

## Abstract
A self supporting fibrous matrix containing immobilized therein at least about 5 by weight of microparticulate, with an average diameter less than 1 micron, preferably fumed silica, or alumina, and flocculating amounts of an organic polycationic resin and an organic polyanionic resin, is useful for fluid treatment and filtration processes, especially delipi dization and depyrogenation of fluids such as serum.
