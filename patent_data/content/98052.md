# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO FREEZERS

## Abstract
A freezer, having an outer housing 1 and a door 2 , contains a number of shelves 3 to 6 upon which frozen food 7 is stored. Each shelf comprises a casing 8 filled with brine solution 10 having an eutectic temperature a few degrees lower than the desired operating temperature of the freezer. An evaporator coil 9 , forming part of a refrigeration system including a compressor, of the freezer, is immersed in the brine solution 10 in each casing. During the night storage period, the compressor is run on cheap rate electricity and the brine solution 10 gives up heat energy, thereby undergoing a phase change. During the daytime, the compressor is stopped and the brine solution 10 slowly absorbs heat energy from within the freezer, thereby slowly undergoing a reverse phase change and maintaining a substantially constant desired operating temperature of the freezer.
