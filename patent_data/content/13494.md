# Measurement of velocity and or distance.

## Abstract
A non contact system suitable for measuring veloc ity distance of, an object travelling inside a ferromagnetic pipeline utilizes magnetic dipoles written into the pipe surface by a transmission coil. These dipoles can be detected by a magnetic detector situated a fixed distance from the trans mission point. If the time taken for a dipole to travel from the transmitter to the detector is recorded then this time will be proportional to the velocity of the system. The system therefore performs a dual role, a as a velocity measurement device, and b as a distance marker. Once the system detects a dipole it requests a further imprint, hence, a constant spacing is maintained between dipoles equal to the spacing between transmitter and detec tor.
