# A process for preparing a diarylamine.

## Abstract
A process for the production of symmetrical and unsym metrical substituted diarylamines is disclosed. The process provides said diarylamines in high yield and purity by the reac tion of a salt of an arylsulfonic acid and an alkali metal salt of a primary arylamine in the presence of an inorganic alkali metal salt. Curve B was obtained by a process in accordance with the invention, and curve A was obtained by a corresponding prior art procedure in which the inorganic alkali metal salt was omitted.
