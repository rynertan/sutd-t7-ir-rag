# Field number conversion circuit.

## Abstract
In a field number conversion circuit the mutual positions of the horizontal and vertical synchronizing signal pattern in a field of the television signal to be converted are measured by means of a measuring circuit 201 and these mutual positions are adequately transferred by means of a coupling circuit 203 to a corresponding field in the converted television signal. Reading the field memories 125, 127 used during the conversion operation is preferably effected at a clock frequen cy at 53 which is not coupled to the clock frequency at 23 used during the writing operation.
