# TORQUE COUPLING

## Abstract
A coupling for transmitting torque between two substan tially parallel shafts particularly a driving shaft and a wheelset of a railway bogie is arranged to accommodate a variable lateral displacement between the shafts, arising for example from oscillation of one of the shafts on its suspension. The coupling comprises a floating ring element F which is coupled to respective radially extending arms LP, LQ on the shafts P, Q by orthogonal pairs of parallel links L . The links and ring element rotate with the shafts substantially in a common radial plane and the connection points between the links and ring element are so disposed that in use, the centre of the ring element orbits the shaft axes and, provided that the shaft axes are nearly coincident, the configuration of the ring element and links is substantial ly unchanged during the rotation.
