## Description
TITLE Vaccinal Polypeptides FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to vaccine preparation and, more particularly, to preparation of a vaccinal influenza virus polypeptide by recombinant DNA techniques. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Influenza virus infection causes acute respiratory disease in man, swine, horses and fowl, sometimes of pandemic proportions. Influenza viruses are orthomyxoviruses and, as such, have enveloped virions of 80 to 120 nanometers in diameter, with two different glycoprotein spikes. Three types, A, B and C, infect humans. Type A viruses have been responsible for the majority of human epidemics in modern history, although there are also sporadic outbreaks of Type B infections.Known swine, equine and fowl viruses have all been Type A. The type A viruses are divided into subtypes based the antigenic properties of on the hemagglutinin HA and neuraminidase NA surface glycoproteins. Within type A, subtypes H1 swine flu , H2 asian flu and H3 tHong Kong flu are predominant in human infections. Due to genetic drift which, at approximately yearly intervals, affects antigenic determinants in the HA and NA proteins, it has not been possible to prepare a universal influenza virus vaccine using conventional killed or attenuated viruses, that is, a vaccine which is non strain specific. Recently, attempts have been made to prepare such universal, or semi universal, vaccines from reassortmant viruses prepared by crossing different strains. More recently, such attempts have involved recombinant DNA techniques focusing primarily on the HA protein. Winter et al., Nature, volume 292, pages 72 75 1981 , report a DNA coding sequence for RA of theA PR 8 34 strain all . Percent homology of amino acid and nucleotide sequences of the HA1 and HA2 subunits of this strain were compared to those of representative strains of subtypes H2, H3 and H7. Baez et al., Nucl. Acids Res., volume 8, pages 5845 5857 1980 , report a DNA coding sequence for the nonstructural NS protein of strain A PR 8 34. Young et al., in The Origin of PandemicInfluenza Viruses, 1983, edit. by W.G. Laver, ElsevierScience Publishing Co., and Young et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, volume 80, pages 6105 6109 1983 , report cloning of cDNA from all eight RNA segments from strainA PR 8 34 in E. coli and report high level expression of the NS1 protein in E. coli. Emtage et al., U.S. Patent 4,357,421, disclose cloning and expression of a coding sequence for an influenza virus HA gene, and disclose that the HA polypeptide is an antigen which may be administered for vaccine purposes. The Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, volume 33, number 19, pages 253 261, review the most recent prevention and control strategies for influenza virus, including dosage and administration protocol for HA protein containing human vaccines. Davis et al., Gene, volume 21, pages 273 284 1983 report on immune responses in mice to HA derived polypeptides. Additional references report cloning and expression of RA, NS and other influenza virus genes of the A PR 8 34 and other strains. Some of such references are cited hereinbelow. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one aspect, the invention is a vaccine for stimulating protection in animals against infection by influenza virus which comprises a polypeptide, other than an HA protein, having an immunogenic determinant of theHA2 subunit of an HA protein. In another aspect, the invention is a polypeptide, other than an HA protein, which comprises an immunogenic determinant of the HA2 subunit, which can be used in the vaccine of the invention. The preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention is herein referred to as the C13 protein. In other aspects, the invention is a DNA molecule comprising a coding sequence for the vaccinal polypeptide of the invention, including the coding sequence alone or incorporated into a larger molecule, such as a DNA cloning or expression vector, and a microorganism or cell transformed with such DNA molecule. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Oftentimes, immunogenic determinants do not stimulate an immunoprotective response. This is believed to be due, in large part, to a failure to present the determinant to a host s bodily defense system in proper configuration. As disclosed and fully described hereinbelow, the immunogenic determinant which may comprise one or more contiguous or separated haptens of the HA2 subunit of the HA protein, surprisingly, induces a cytotoxic T cell response against different strains within the subtype of origin. Thus, the HA2 immunogenic determinant can provoke a protective immune response, if it is presented in an immunogenic configuration, which is subtype specific, rather than strain specific. For example, theHA2 determinant can be presented in a vaccinal polypeptide comprising the HA2 subunit, that is, substantially the entire HA2 subunit of the HA protein, fused to a second polypeptide which permits an immune response to the immunogenic determinant by causing the HA2 subunit to assume an immunogenic configuration. Preferably, the polypeptide which permits such immune response to the HA2 immunogenic determinant comprises an amino acid sequence which is expressed at high levels by a recombinant host, prokaryotic or eukaryotic, fused to the N terminus of substantially the entire HA2 subunit. Especially preferred is a polypeptide derived from an influenza virus protein. The vaccinal polypeptide is not the HA protein, because immunoprotective response to the HA protein appears to be strain specific. For expression of such vaccinal polypeptide carrying the HA2 immunogenic determinant in E. coli, the polypeptide which permits an immune response to the HA2 determinant is preferably the N terminus of the NS1 influenza virus protein. A particular and preferred embodiment thereof is a protein herein referred to as C13. The C13 protein has the first 81 amino acids of theNS1 protein fused, through a serine and an arginine of HAl origin, to the entire HA2 subunit. The vaccinal polypeptide of the invention can be prepared by chemical synthesis techniques. Preferably, however, it is prepared by known recombinant DNA techniques by cloning and expressing within a host microorganism or cell a DNA fragment carrying a coding sequence for the polypeptide. The preferred host is E. coli because it can be used to produce large amounts of desired proteins safely and cheaply. Coding sequences for the HA2, NS1 and other viral proteins of influenza virus can be prepared synthetically or can be derived from viral RNA, by known techniques, or from available cDNA containing plasmids.For example, in addition to the above cited references, aDNA coding sequence for HA from the A Japan 305 57 strain was cloned, sequenced and reported by Gething et al.,Nature, volume 87, pages 301 306 1980 a HA coding sequence for strain A NT 60 68 was cloned as reported by Sleigh et al., and by Both et al., both in Developments inCell Biology, Elsevier Science Publishing Co., pages 69 79 and 81 89, 1980 a HA coding sequence for strain A WSN 33 was cloned as reported by Davis et al., Gene, volume 10, pages 205 218 1980 and by Hiti et al., Virology, volume 111, pages 113 124 1981 . An HA coding sequence for fowl plague virus was cloned as reported by Porter et al., and by Emtage et al., both in Developments in Cell Biology, cited above, at pages 39 49 and 157 168.Also, influenza viruses, including other strains, subtypes and types, are available from clinical specimens and from public depositories, such as the American Type CultureCollection, Rockville, Maryland, U.S.A. Systems for cloning and expressing the vaccinal polypeptide in various microorganisms and cells, including, for example, E. coli, Bacillus, Streptomyces, Saccharomyces and mammalian and insect cells, are known and available from private and public laboratories and depositories and from commercial vendors. The vaccine of the invention comprises one or more vaccinal polypeptides of the invention, and a carrier or diluent therefor. For example, such vaccine can comprise substantially the entire HA2 subunit from each of several subtypes, each fused to N terminal amino acids of the NS1 protein, which is highly conserved, in normal saline or other physiological solution. Use of an adjuvant, such as aluminum hydroxide, may prove to be desirable. A preferred vaccine comprises three vaccinal polypeptides, each comprising substantially the entire HA2 subunit from one of the H1, H2 and H3 subtypes fused to about the first 80 amino acids of any NS1 protein, as in the case of the C13 protein.Alternatively, a polyvalent vaccine can be prepared from one or more polypeptides of the invention combined with additional immunogens derived from influenza virus or other pathogens, such as subunit or polypeptide antigens or killed viruses or bacteria, to produce a vaccine which can stimulate protection against influenza virus as well as other invasive organisms or viruses. Techniques for formulating such vaccines are well known. For example, the vaccinal polypeptide, and other immunogens in the case of a combination vaccine, can be lyophilized for subsequent rehydration in saline or other physiological solutions. Dosage and administration protocol can be optimized in accordance with standard vaccination practices. Typically, the vaccine w ill be administered intramuscularly, although other routes of administration may be used, such as oral, intraocular and intranasal administration. Based on what is known about other polypeptide vaccines, it is expected that a useful single dosage for average adult humans is in the range of 1.5 to 150 micrograms, preferably 10 to 100 micrograms. The vaccine can be administered initially in late summer or early fall and can be readministered two to six weeks later, if desirable, or periodically as immunity wanes, for example, every two to five years. The following examples are illustrative, and not limiting, of the invention. Example 1. Plasmid pM30 Plasmid pAPR701 is a pBR322 Åaerived cloning vector which carries coding regions for the Ml and M2 influenza virus proteins A PR 8 34 . It is described byYoung et al., in The Origin of Pandemic Influenza Viruses, 1983, edited by W.G. Laver, Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Plasmid pAPR801 is a pBR322 derived cloning vector which carries the NS1 coding region A PR 8 34 It is described by Young et al., cited above. Plasmid pASl is a pBR322 derived expression vector which contains the PL promoter, an N utilization site to relieve transcriptional polarity effects in a presence of N protein and the cII ribosome binding site including the cli translation initiation codon followed immediately by a Bam HI site. It is described byRosenberg et al., Methods Enzymol., volume 101, pages 123 138 1983 . Plasmid pASldeltaEH was prepared by deleting a non essential Eco RI Hin dIII region of pBR322 origin from pASl. A 1236 base pair Bam HI fragment of pAPR801, containing the NS1 coding region in 861 base pairs of viral origin and 375 base pairs of pBR322 origin, was inserted into the Bam HI site of pASldeltaEH. The resulting plasmid, pASldeltaEH 801 expresses authentic NS1 230 amino acids . This plasmid has an Nco I site between the codons for amino acids 81 and 82 and an Nru I site 3 to the NS sequences. The Bam HI site between amino acids 1 and 2 is retained. A 571 base pair fragment carrying a coding sequence for the C terminal 50 amino acids of the Ml protein was obtained by restricting pAPR701 with Nco I andEco R5. This fragment was inserted between the Nco I andNru I sites in pASdeltaEH 801 subsequent to deletion of that fragment from the plasmid. The resulting plasmid, pM 30, codes for a fusion protein which is the first 81 amino acids of NS1 fused to the last 50 amino acids of M1. TheNcoI and BamHI sites are retained. Example 2. Plasmid pC13 Plasmid pJZ102 is a pBR322 derived cloning vector which carries a coding region for the entire HA protein A PR 8 34 . It is described by Young et al., cited in Example 1. Plasmid pBgl II is a pBR322 derived cloning vector which carries a Bgl II linker at the Nru I site in pBR322. pJZ102 was cut with Mnl I. Bgl II linkers were ligated to all ends and the HA2 containing fragment was reinserted. The 5 junction in the resulting plasmid, pBgl II HA2, was sequenced as follows 1 2 3 5 AGATCTG TCCAGA GGT 3 Region 1 is derived from the Bgl II linker and codes for asparagine and leucine. Region 2 is derived from HA1 and codes for serine and arginine. Region 3 is derived fromHA2 and codes for all amino acids of the HA2 subunit. The 3 junction was sequenced as follows 3 4 5 6 5 ATATGCATC TGA GATTAGAATTTCA CAGATCTRegion 4 is the HA2 stop codon. Region 5 is 3 non coding sequences of viral origin. Region 6 is derived from theBgl II linker. A 691 base pair fragment carrying the HA2 coding sequence was obtained by restricting pBgl II HA2 with BglII. The fragment was end filled with DNApolI Klenow and ligated into pASldeltaEH 801 which had been cut with Nco I and similarly end filled Klenow . The resulting plasmid is pC13. The NS1 HA2, blunt ended junction was sequenced as follows 7 1 2 3 5 XAAATGACCATG GATCTG TCCAGA GGT 3 Region 7 is derived from the NS1 gene. Regions 1,2 and 3 are as defined above. Example 3. Production of the C13 Protein E. coli host strain N5151, a temperature sensitive lambda lysogen cI857 was transformed with pC13. Transformants were grown at 320C to mid log phase A260 0.6 in LB broth supplemented with 100 micrograms ml of ampicillin. The cultures were then shifted to 420C to inactivate cI and thus induce synthesis of the C13 protein. After 2 hours at 420C, the bacteria were collected by centrifugation 3500 rpm, 20 min and the bacterial pellet was frozen at 200C. The pellet was thawed and resuspended in bufferA 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 2Mm EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 vol vol glycerol. Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mg ml, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 20 minutes. The mixture was then treated in aWaring blender at high speed for six bursts of 15 seconds each. The suspension was then son ica ted for one minute with a Branson probe sonifier. The mixture was then centrifuged 15,000 rpm, 30 minutes . The pellet was resuspended in buffer A by sonication 4 x 15 second bursts . The mixture was then made 0 1 deoxycholate and stirred for one hour at 40C.The mixture was centrifuged 15,000 rpm, 30 minutes and the protein was pelleted. The deoxycholate treatment was repeated and the resulting pellet was then resuspended in buffer A by sonication. The suspension was then made 1 Triton X 100 and stirred for one hour at 40C. The mixture was again centrifuged 15,000 rpm, 30 minutes and the protein pellet was collected. The protein was resuspended by sonication and the protein was solubilized with urea 4M final concentration . This solution was centrifuged to remove any particulate material 15,000 rpm, 30 minutes and the supernatant was collected and dialyzed against three, one liter changes of 10 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA to remove the urea.The protein solution was again centrifuged to remove any particulate material 15,000 rpm, 30 minutes and the supernatant which contained the C13 protein, was collected and used for assays. Example 4. T Cell Assay The ability of the C13 protein to induce a cytoxic T cell response in an in vitro assay was compared to that of other proteins also of A PR 8 34 origin. The other proteins are herein identified as C7 complete HA Delta 7 HA1 and 80 N terminal residues of HA2 C36 HA2 Delta 13 80 N terminal residues of NS1 and 80 N terminal residues of HA2 NS1 NS1 NS2 NS2 M30 NSl and See, Example 1 Molecules comprising the coding sequence for each of these was derived as described by Young et al., in theOrigin of Pandemic Influenza Viruses, 1983, edit. by W.G.Laver, Elsevier Science Publishing Co. and were expressed in pASldeltaEH substantially as described above. The protein was produced substantially as described above except that following resuspension of the bacterial pellet, lysozyme treatment, sonication and centrifugation, the NS1 protein was contained in the supernatant. The supernatant was made 100 mM MgCl2 and stirred for one hour at 40C. The solution was then centrifuged 15,000 rpm, 30 minutes to pellet the NS1.The pellet was resuspended in buffer A and again treated with 100 mM MgC12 to reprecipitate the NS1 protein.Following a recentrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in buffer A and dialyzed against three one liter changes of 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA. The solution was then centrifuged again to remove any particulate material and the supernatant containing the NS1 protein was collected and used for assays. The cytoxic T cell assay was carried out substantially as follows. Spleen cells were isolated from virus immune or non immune mice and cultured in vitro.Cells were subdivided and exposed to various antigens for 90 mins in vitro. The antigens were then removed by repeated washing of cells and the cells were then cultured for 5 days to allow expansion of stimulated populations.Stimulated cells, that is, effector cells, were mixed with virus infected or non infected P815 target cells which had been pre loaded with 51Cr. Significant release of 51Cr into the culture medium indicated a presence of secondary cytotoxic T cells 2 CTL , which had been generated by the in vitro stimulation with antigen. The specificity of killing was examined in two ways 1 target cells infected with different antigens were tested for killing and, 2 spleen cells were isolated from mice which had been immunized with different viruses. The linearity of the assay was also examined using different target effector cell ratios and using different amounts of antigen, as indicated in the following table, which show illustrative results. Results are listed below indicated effector target cell ratios which were 30 1 and 10 1. Values in the tables are expressed as the percent of 51Cr released into the medium compared to the total amount of 51Cr in cells as determined by detergent solubilization of cells.

All other peptide derivatives that were studied, including NS1, delta7, deltal3, M30, NS2 and C36, failed to induce such a response, as have certain hemagglutinin constructs. The response to the C13 peptide is dose dependent and levels from 5 micrograms per ml through 24 micrograms per ml induced secondary cytotoxic T cell responses. The viral specificity of the observed responses is striking in that C13 stimulated immune spleen cells from mice previously infected with HlNl virus but did not stimulate immune spleen cells in mice previously infected with H3N2 virus A PC . This is unlike the subtype crossreactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses observed when stimulating the same spleen cells with live virus due, at least in part, to the cross reactive internal antigens.In addition the stimulation by C13 is cross reactive among virus strains in the HlNl subtype PR8 immune spleen cells stimulated by C13 in vitro were able to recognize and kill target cells infected with PR8 HlNl strain from 1934 as well as target cells infected with the A Brazil HlNl strain of 1978 over a dosage range of 12 micrograms through 48 micrograms and at a high degree of cytotoxic activity. Based on substantial data showing that cytotoxicT lymphocytes appear to contribute to recovery from influenza virus infection in mouse systems and that such lymphocyte responses can be detected in both immune mice and humans see, Ennis et al., Microbiology 1984, pages 427 430, Amer. Soc. Microbiology , the ability of the C13 protein to induce such cytoxic T cell response across strains indicates its utility, and the utility of the HA2 immunogenic determinant, to induce an immune response which will resist influenza virus infection the response is semi universal in that it is subtype, but not strain, specific. The invention and its preferred embodiments are fully disclosed above. However, the invention is not limited to such specifically disclosed embodiments.Rather, it encompasses all modifications and variations coming within the scope of the following claims.
