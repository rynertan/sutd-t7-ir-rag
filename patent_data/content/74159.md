# Shielded cover for a quick release electrical connector.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a shielded cover 19 for an electrical connector part. The connector part 10 has a hollow, substantially cylindrical, open ended hub portion 11 with at least one radially protruding keying member 12 on its outer surface and a flange 13 axially spaced from the keying member by a predetermined distance. The cover 19 has a cap like structure and comprises an open end, an imperforate end wall 20 and a cylindrical sidewall 21 . The sidewall edge margin defining the cap open end has a continuous radially inwardly directed flange 22 which forms an opening which is less than the cross section of the hub 10 taken through the keying member 12 . The cap also has a depression 23 in the inner surface of its cylindrical sidewall 21 so that the inner diameter of the cap at that portion is greater than the hub cross sectional diameter taken through the keying member 12 . Metal lining means 24 are affixed to the inner surface of the cap end wall 20 so that a portion 26 of the lining means extends partway along the cap sidewall 21 . The dimension of the lining means are such that the lining means make adequate contact with the end portion 17 of the connector part when the cover 19 is in place.
