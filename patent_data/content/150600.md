# MEMBRANE SWITCH ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A membrane switch assembly 10 is comprised of spaced apart layers 12, 16 having corresponding patterns of conductive switch contacts 28, 28 arranged in series thereon, the layers 12, 16 being separated by spacing means 20 having openings therein. The switch contacts 28, 28 on each layer are spaced along a single conductive path 24, 24 so that a regular unit value of impedance means exists between the switch contacts 28, 28 . When the electrical circuit is completed by closing a switch site, the resulting total impedance is essentially equal to the sum of the unit values of the impedance means along the circuit path formed by the closed switch.
