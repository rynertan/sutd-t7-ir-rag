# Automated xeroradiographic processor.

## Abstract
An automated xeroradiographic processor particularly for use in intraoral dental radiography. The imaging process is based on xeroradiographic principles, the surface of a small photoconductive plate being electrically charged. After insertion into a carrier, to form a light tight cassette 16 , the photoconductive plate is placed in a patient s mouth and x ray exposed. The cassette 16 , and the resultant electrostatic charge image therein, is inserted into the system processor 10 , the photoconductive plate removed and transported to a developer station 30 wherein the image is developed using liquid toner. The toner image is then dried at 40 and transferred at 50 from the photoconductive plate by using a transparent adhesive material and fixed to a white plastic substrate, forming an image carrier wherein the image can be viewed in reflectance or transmittance. After cleaning means 60 the photoconductive plate is available for reuse. The developed xeroradiographic images are exposed and processed sequentially, processing time being approximately 20 seconds.
