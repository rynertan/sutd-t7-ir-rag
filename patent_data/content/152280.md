# A method for coating high energy explosive crystals.

## Abstract
A method for coating high energy explosive crystals is carried out in an apparatus having fluidized bed, in the house of which moist explosive crystals are predried and coated with a dispersion of flegmatizing and binding agents injected into said house through nozzles, whereby said explosive crystals from agglomerates and said agglomerates form granules. Water from the dispersion is evaporated and the granules ready for use are discharged. The method is particularly suitable for coating HMX, RDX and pentrite and may be used on explosive crystals having a grain size of about 1 mm, as well as about 150 microns and a even below 20 microns. The dispersion comprises, as a main ingredient, for instance plastic or wax.
