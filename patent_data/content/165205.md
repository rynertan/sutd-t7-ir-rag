# Movable heat chamber insulating structure.

## Abstract
An insulation structure for a heat chamber, e.g., a wall or ceiling for a furnace, is now supported and linked to a frame in a manner providing for ease of repair plus simplicity of maintenance. In one embodiment a series of side by side ceramic fiber blankets 6 can be maintained in snug relationship, in part by adjustable compression means 14 . Heat loss, which can otherwise be caused by heat induced ceramic fiber shrinkage, is now substantially reduced to eliminated by the manner of supporting the insulation structure coupled with the compression exerted against such structure.
