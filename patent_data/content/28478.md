# Improvements in or relating to pipette means.

## Abstract
This invention is in the field of automatic chemical more especially bio chemical analysis. It improves accuracy of sampling, diluting and dispens ing of liquids, eg blood serum. A circumferentially compressible tube 10 communi cates through the lower of two connecting tubes 22 with a pipette tip, and through the upper with a source of diluent. The tube 10 is compressed circumferentially and elastically by fluid pressure applied through a connector 24 into a space 16 surrounding the tube 10 inside a block 12 . Relief of the pressure allows tube 10 to expand and draw a sample into said pipette tip, the sample volume being dependent on the fluid pressure applied. Reapplication of pressure expels the sample from the pipette tip. Any diluent required is supplied through the upper connecting tube 22 , and passes out through the pipette tip. It is important for consistency of results that the tube 10 be compressed elestically, and a suitable material for the tube 10 is latex rubber. It may be lined with silicone rubber to reduce moisture absorption.
