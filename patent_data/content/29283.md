# Apparatus for re orienting a plurality of serially supplied items.

## Abstract
A transfer unit for serial re orientation of items com prises an item supply train and a rotatable cylindrical hous ing 24. The items are provided serially to an inlet to the housing by a chain ladder or other mechanical means, and are longitudinally and axially re oriented in the housing for transfer out of the housing. This is done by a succession of shafts 52, 58, 64, 62, 138 etc which are progressively skewed and pass the items via carrier devices 48, 56 from shaft to shaft with progressive re orientation from parallel to the housing axis to transverse to the housing axis. The housing is rotatable about its axis to provide further re orientation of the items. All internal components of the rotatable housing are synchronously driven by mechanical means, and positive mechanical control of the serially sup plied items is maintained at all times. The unit is suitable for feeding shells to a gun with a variable angle of eleva tion, with which the orientation of the housing can be matched.
