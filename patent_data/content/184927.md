# CRYSTALLINE GALLOBOROSILICATES

## Abstract
Galloborosilicates of zeolitic structure, Ga and B being present in the crystal lattice in defined quantity, having a low Al and alkali metal content. The materials are synthesised by vapor phase treatment of a borosilicate zeolite with a source of gallium, and may be used as catalysts in acid catalysed reac tions such as cracking and paraffin isomerisation.
