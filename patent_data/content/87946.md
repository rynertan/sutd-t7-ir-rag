# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CREATING NUMERICAL CONTROL DATA

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for creating numerical control data by entering coordinates which specify points on a drawing placed on a tablet. A minimum reading distance is preset at the time that coordinate values of points are to be entered from the tablet. This is followed by entering the coordinate values of prescribed points on the drawing by designating the points at random using coordinate designat ing means, generating the coordinate values of whatever point is being designatea by the coordinate designating means each time said means travel a distance equivalent to the minimum reading distance as said means is moved continuously along a graphic appearing on the drawing, and creating numerical control data by using the coordinate values. Numerical control data approximating straight line segments can be readily created, even for curves other than straight lines and circular arcs, by setting a sampling pitch interval to a suitable value.
