# Process for producing synthesis gas by partial combustion of hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
Process for production of synthesis gas in which a saturated hydrocarbon and an oxygen containing gas having a ratio of hydrocarbon to oxygen of greater than the stoichiometric ratio for complate combustion are introduced into a bed of particulate material. The bed comprises material which is catalytically active for partial oxidation and or steam reforming reactions. The upward flow rate of the hydrocarbon oxygen containing gas steam is sufficiently large to cause a spouting action of the bed material. The hydrocarbon and oxygen react together and the products of the reaction are withdrawn.
