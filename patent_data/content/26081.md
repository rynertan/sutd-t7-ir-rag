# A spinner.

## Abstract
A spinner particularly intended to be used in the applica tion of a resist or liquid developer to a semiconductor wafer during semiconductor device production comprises a spindle RS for supporting and rotating a workpiece W at high speed, and a cup SC surrounding the spindle RS . The cup SC includes a port EP in its base wall and a deflector ring DR projecting inwards from the inside wall of the cup. The defector ring includes an annular barrier 12 at its inner peripheral edge and the barrier projects above and below the defector ring DR at 13 and 14 . An inner peripheral surface 15 of the barrier diverges from the axis of the spindle RS in at least the upwards direction.
