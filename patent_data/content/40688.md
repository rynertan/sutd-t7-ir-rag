# Supply voltage compensated contactless ignition system for internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
A supply voltage compensated contactless ignition system for internal combustion engines, which includes input transistors 15, 23 operabie in response to an engine ignition signal so as to control the operation of a power transistor 30 to control the energization of an ignition coil with the operating level of the input transistors being varied with variation in the supply voltage, further includes a current mirror circuit having first and second current shunt paths 12, 9 including first and second transistors 11, 13 which are connected in parallel with a voltage clamping device such that the each current path substan tially the same amount of current when the supply voltage is normal and that one of the current paths shunts a cur rent increased over that of the other in response to a rise of the supply voltage beyond a predetermined value, and includes a shunt device 20 for shunting the increased current to the input transistors.
