# Aerial power transmission system.

## Abstract
Lightning arresters, each comprising a non linear resistor made of a main component of zinc oxide and another minor component are connected between a steel tower and a power transmission cable supported on the steel tower by an insulator and between the power transmission cables in different phases whereby the lightning resistance of the aerial power transmission system is improved.
