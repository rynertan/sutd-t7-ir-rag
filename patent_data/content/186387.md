# An internal reflection interference semiconductor laser device.

## Abstract
An internal reflection interference semiconductor laser device comprising a first laser operation area ranging from one facet to the internal reflecting section and a second laser operation area ranging from the other facet to the internal reflecting section, wherein the internal cavity length ℓ₁ of the first laser operation area is shorter than the internal cavity length ℓ₂ of the second laser operation area, the reflectivity R₁ at the facet on the side of the first laser operation area is smaller than the reflectivity R₂ at the facet on the side of the second laser operation area.
