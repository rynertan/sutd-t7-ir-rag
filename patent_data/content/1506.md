## Description
Organic Nitriles THIS INVENTION relates to the manufacture of organic nitriles and more particularly to the conversion of olefinically unsaturated mononitriles to dinitriles. Our invention provides a process for the disproportionation of a C5 mono olefinically unsaturated mononitrile into a mixture of C6 saturated dinitrile and butadiene which comprises heating the said mononitrile, in the absence of added hydrogen cyanide, with a zerovalent nickel catalyst. The C5 mono olefinically unsaturated mononitrile is preferably one in which the nitrile and olefinic group are unconjugated. Particularly suitable mononitriles are 3 pentenenitrile, 4 pentenenitrile and 2 methyl 3 butenenitrile. The zerovalent nickel catalyst is preferably of the formula NiL4 where L represents a suitable ligand. Suitable ligands include organic phosphines, arsines, stibines, phosphites, arsenites, stibites, phosphinites and phosphonites. Particularly suitable ligands are those phosphorus compounds of the formulaP XYZ where X and Y represent R or OR and Z representsOR, where the R s, which may be the same or different, represent alkyl or aryl groups. Preferably the alkyl or aryl groups contain up to 18 carbon atoms. More preferably the alkyl groups contain from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and the aryl groups are phenyl, tolyl, xylyl or substituted phenyl groups. As examples of such ligands there may be mentioned trimethyl phosphite, triethyl phosphite, triphenyl phosphite, tri m tolyl phosphite, tri p tolyl phosphite, tri p chloro phenyl phosphite and tri p methoxyphenyl phosphite. The disproportionation process is effected by heating the said mononitrile with the zerovalent nickel catalyst. The temperature of heating is, for example, within the range 500 to 2000C and is preferably within the range 1000 to 1500C. The disproportionation process is preferably effected in the presence of a Lewis acid. Suitable Lewis acids are, for example, the salts of various metals, especially zinc, aluminium, titanium, tin and iron. The anion of the salt may be inorganic, for example, fluoride, chloride, bromide or iodide, sulphate or phosphate and may be the anion of an organic carboxylic acid, especially a lower aliphatic acid having up to 6 carbon atoms, for example, the acetate. It may also be advantageous to add ligand in excess of that required to form the zerovalent nickel complex. If desired the disproportionation process may be carried out in the presence of a solvent. Suitable solvents are, for example, hydrocarbon solvents, e.g. benzene, toluene and xylene, or nitrile solvents, e.g. acetonitrile, propionitrile, benzonitrile and adiponitrile. The zerovalent nickel catalyst is used in catalytically effective amount, for example in the range of 0.005 to 0.2 moles per mole of mononitrile. The Lewis acid may be used, for example, in the proportion of from 0.5 to 50 moles per mole of catalyst and preferably in the range 1 to 5 moles. The disproportionation process may be effected, for example, by heating the said mononitrile with the catalyst and optionally Lewis acid, excess ligand and solvent, in a closed vessel under autogeneous pressure. The period of heating may be varied, for example, according to the degree of conversion of starting material desired, and may vary, for example, from 0.5 to 50 hours. At the end of the process the reaction mixture comprises, in addition to catalyst, unconverted mononitrile and possibly its isomers formed during the process, butadiene and C6 saturated dinitriles. The C6 saturated dinitriles are principally adiponitrile and 2 methylglutaronitrile.Any conversion of the starting mononitrile to an isomer during the process, for example of 3 pentenenitrile to 4 pentenenitrile or vice versa is immaterial since the isomers are also converted to the dinitriles. The principal components of the reaction mixture may be separated from each other by any convenient means, for example by fractional distillation, desirably in part under reduced pressure. If desired the butadiene may alternatively be bled from the reaction vessel as the process proceeds. The process of our invention may be used in the manufacture of adiponitrile from butadiene. Thus butadiene may be converted to 3 pentenenitrile by methods known in themselves, for example by reaction with hydrogen cyanide in the presence of a copper catalyst as described, for example, in British Patent Specification No. 1,429,651.The 3 pentenenitrile may then be disproportionated to adiponitrile and butadiene according to the process of our invention and the butadiene recycled for further conversion to 3 pentenenitrile. Adiponitrile may be converted by hydrogenation to hexamethylene diamine a valuable intermediate for the manufacture of polyamides and polyurethanes, especially of polyhexamethylene adipamide nylon 6,6 useful in the manufacture of fibres, films and mouldings.
