# Reusable tubular casing as well as apparatus comprising this casing and process for the production of skinless sausages, particularly parboil or raw sausages.

## Abstract
The apparatus for the production of skinless sausages, particularly parboil or raw sausages comprises a casing 5 consisting at least for the most part of a porous polytetra fluoroethylene membrane which is supported on at least a part of its circumferential area by support elements 1 . The new process for the production of skinless sausages, comprises the following steps 1 Heating the sausage mix in reusable tubular casings or apparatus comprising such casings in order to drive off water or water vapor and other volatile materials and to form an integral skin by at least superficial coagulation of the sausage mix, and 2 removal of the sausage having an integral skin from the casing. The casing consists of a reusable material permeable for water vapor and other gases, which is non adherent to the sausage mix. Thereafter, the skinless sausage can be smoked, and the casing or apparatus can be reused.
