# A singly fed circularly polarized microstrip antenna.

## Abstract
A singly fed circularly polarized microstrip antenna has a dielectric substrate 10 having a ground layer 12 coated on one side thereof and a metallic patch radiator 14 coated on the other side thereof. The radiator 14 takes any arbi trary configuration and excites circularly polarized waves at two frequencies. The feed point is located on the loci Γ₁, Γ₂, Γ₃, Γ₄ , determined by the exciting frequency and the cir cularly polarized wave rotation direction.
