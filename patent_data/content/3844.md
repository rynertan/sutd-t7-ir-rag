# Electric switch adapted to be opened and closed by successive operations of a push button.

## Abstract
In a push push switch a contact carrier 24 is provided which carries a contact member 32 movable to and from a position in which it touches two terminals 9 . The contact carrier 24 is provided with a central ribbed 26 boss 25 movable in a channel defined by co operating axially extending ribs 18 , the lowermost surface of the boss being serrated 27 to cause rotation of a rotatable member 21 having arms 22 which engage the serrations 27 on movement thereof by the push button. The arms 22 , in one position can pass freely past the ribs 18 , and in another position engage a stop surface 20 on the ribs 18 , thus retaining the contact carrier 24 in a lower position in which the switch is closed. A first spring 13 biasses the rotatable member 21 upwardly and a second spring 39 biasses the contact carrier 24 downwardly.
