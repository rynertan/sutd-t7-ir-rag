# Apparatus for maintaining a diesel engine in restarting condition.

## Abstract
A large primary engine 10 is maintained in readiness to start under low ambient temperature conditions by a small auxiliary engine 24 having a liquid cooling system in parallel with the cooling system of the primary engine. Exhaust from the auxiliary engine heats the coolant circulat ing through the two engines in a heat exchanger 40 . The lubricating oil from the primary engine 10 is also heated by the auxiliary engine exhaust 42 in the same heat exchanger 40 . A generator 36 driven by the auxiliary engine 24 charges the batteries 26 used to start the primary engine 10 .
