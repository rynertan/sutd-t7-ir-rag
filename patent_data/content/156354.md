# Controlled oxidation of microbially produced cysteine containing proteins.

## Abstract
Method of oxidizing reduced cysteine containing micro bially produced synthetic proteins, such as synthetic INF Î² or synthetic IL 2, in a controlled manner so that the synthetic proteins have the same disulfide bridging as their native counterparts. The oxidation employs o iodosobenzoate as oxidizing agent and is carried out in an aqueous medium at a pH at least about one half pH unit less than the pK
