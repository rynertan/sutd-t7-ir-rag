# Hydrostatic propulsion system and method with inching throttle and brake.

## Abstract
A hydrostatic propulsion system and method of opera tion is disclosed for smoothly driving a vehicle, such as a street sweeper. The system includes a shift lever for selec tively moving a pump stroking valve 100 into reverse, neutral, low forward, and fast 160 forward speed positions to prepare the system. After the shift lever has been placed in a forward or reverse position, an accelerator pedal must be depressed to partially or fully close an inching throttle valve 31 before the pump 80 swash plate moves from its zero piston displacement position and begins to pump fluid to the hydrostatic motors. Hydrostatic braking forces 33 are applied when the accelerator pedal is released and also in response to initial depression of a brake pedal for providing normal braking to the vehicle. Further depression of the brake pedal operates a conventional brake system for panic stops. Movement into the high forward speed range is accomplished by moving the shift lever into high which activates a circuit 160, 164 for shifting the swash plates of the hydrostatic motors 22, 24 into high speed positions.
