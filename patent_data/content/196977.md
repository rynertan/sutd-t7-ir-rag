# MULTI CONTACT CONNECTOR HAVING GROUND TERMINAL BLOCK AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THE SAME

## Abstract
A multi contact connector comprises a ground terminal block 7 having branched connections 7a , and a connector portion 6 having a plurality of contacts 1,1 . The branched connections 7a of the ground terminal block 7 are connected to some of the contacts 1 of the connector portion 6 to be grounded. A method of manufacturing a multi contact connector comprises steps of producing a ground terminal block 7 having branched connections 7a to be connected to contacts 1 to be grounded in accordance with requirement of a circuit to be connected, and connect ing the branched connections 7a with distal ends 1a of the contacts 1 of a connector portion 6 separately produced. In a process of producing the ground terminal block 7 , a ground terminal block having branched connections 7a at different locations according to requirement of a circuit to be connected is produced every time when the contacts 1 to be grounded are changed, or a ground terminal block 7 having a great number of branched connections 7a commonly formed for requirement of various circuits is produced and then unnecessary branched connections are removed to form a ground terminal block having the branched connec tions only required for requirement of a specific circuit to be connected.
