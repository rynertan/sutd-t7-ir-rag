A heating appliance consisting of a reservoir 1 contain ing liquid, such as water 3 , heatable with the aid of a heat source, such as an electric resistance. The drawback of this type of heating appliances is that the reservoir has been dimensioned to be very large in capacity. In the heating appliance according to the invention, there is around the heat source installed, in upright position, an elongated tube 4 which is open at its top as well as its bottom end and which constitutes a small, rapidly heating liquid volume separate from the reservoir, whence the liquid being heated rises to the upper part of the reservoir 1 .
