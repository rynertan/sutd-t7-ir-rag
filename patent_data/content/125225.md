## Description
A METHOD FOR PRODUCING FIBROUS GYPSUM m DescriptionTechnical fieldThe present invention relates to a novel acicular gypsum crystal, and to a method for producing gypsum in the form of acicular crystals, so called fibrous gypsum, having a length which exceeds their thickness by 10 1000 times, by dissolving and transforming calcium sulphate CaSO4 AH2O, CaSO4 2H20 . The object of the present invention is to provide a possibility of producing acicular gypsum crystals which contain calcium sulphate in anhydrite form and calcium sulphate in dihydrate form, which gypsum crystals are suitable for admixture with cellulose fibre materials, building materials, asbestos fibre substitutes, etc.Background artGypsum has been the subject of research and development for a great many years, and many attempts have been made to find a use therefor within various fields in this respect, attempts have also been made to find a use for the large amounts of gypsum precipitates obtained in different processes, and particularly those obtained when producing phosphoric acid in accordance with the wet process. Gypsum is also formed in other chemical processes, within the so called heavy chemical unorganic industry. Because present day gypsum precipitates contain undesirable substances, they cannot be dumped freely into the sea, but must first be limed and then dumped on land, therewith incurring heavy handling costs.Gypsum is today used by the building material industries, and is mixed with cement or used to produce gypsum panels and sheeting used as building material in the construction of buildings, and in particular in the construction of internal walls. It has also been proposed to admix gypsum with cellulose fibres, in order to reduce the need for raw wood materials in the paper and board manufacturing industries.When manufacturing building board, and also when admixing gypsum with cellulose fibres, it is desirable to have the gypsum in fibre form, i.e. in the form of acicular crystals, in order to thereby improve its manageability and mechanical strength.Various methods have been proposed for producing so called fibrous gypsum.For example, there is described in DE A1 28 54 722 a method for producing calcium sulphate hemihydrate, from, inter alia, calcium sulphate dihydrate, calcium sulphate ss hemihydrate or calcium sulphate anhydrite, in which an aqueous slurry of such starting material is subjected to a hydrothermal reaction, to form acicular and or particulate gypsum crystals. To this end, there is added to the slurry a powderous inorganic substance, such as talc, silica, calcium carbonate, calcium sulphate anhydrite in solution, or calcium sulphate hemihydrate. The resultant fibrous calcium sulphate O hemihydrate can be converted to anhydrite form by calcination, the resultant acicular crystals being re formed to particulate gypsum.The reaction as such can be carried out in autoclave, by heating an aqueous slurry to 100 1800C for 1 90 minutes, normally 120 135 C for 5 10 minutes.The described method is heat consuming and is unable to provide a pure product which does not incorporate silica, talc, clay, etc.In DE Al 26 13 651 DE A1 26 59 860 and DE A1 26 59 861 there are described methods for producing fibrous gypsum in the form of Ot hemihydrate gypsum or anhydrite gypsum starting from calcium sulphite which is oxidized to calcium sulphate hemihydrate at elevated temperatures and pressure and over considerable lengths of time 1300C 2 kp cm2 1 hour . Calcination at 200 8000C provides anhydrite fibrous gypsum. This method is also energy consuming and demanding on the apparatus used. All of the aforecited methods are relatively complicated, and none enables a pure gypsum product of fibrous gypsum having mixed water of crystallization contents to be produced.Disclosure of the present inventionIt has now surprisingly been found possible to produce a fibrous gypsum with a mixed water of crystallization content in accordance with the present invention in a simple and rational manner. The invention is characterized by dissolving calcium sulphate, hemihydrate or dihydrate, in a sulphuric acid solution containing at least 35 H2SO4, to saturation at an elevated temperature of 70 100 C permitting the resultant clear, saturated solution to cool to ambient temperature under agitation, thereby to crystallize out fibrous gypsum containing 50 65 calcium sulphate anhydrite and 35 50 calcium sulphate dihydrate.It was found that the resultant fibre had a composite crystalline structure comprising normally about 50 anhydrite gypsum and about 50 dihydrate gypsum. No hemi semi hydrate gypsum was present. The resultant fibre was, for the most, also extremely long in relation to its thickness 100 1000 times .The gypsum used to produce fibrous gypsum may be gypsum obtained from the manufacture of phosphoric acid in accordance with the wet method, or gypsum obtained from flue gas purifying plants, or, when a highly pure product is desired, from pure, natural gypsum.Gypsum obtained from phosphoric acid manufacturing processes often contains solid contaminants deriving from the apatite or the phosphate used. These contaminants can be readily removed when the gypsum is dissolved.The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the following examples.Example 1Sulphuric acid so Jtions containing 39, 63 and 70 H2S04 were saturated with S hemihydrate gypsum at 850C. Undissolved gypsum was filtered off and the clear solution was allowed to cool to room temperature under slight agitation, thereby to crystallize out gypsum. The gypsum precipitate was separated from the solution after 16 hours, and analyzed.ResultTest H2SOq konc.

Undissolved gypsum was filtered off and the clear filtrate was allowed to cool to room temperature while being slightly agitated, thereby to crystallize out gypsum. The sample analyses took 4, 7, 12, 24 and 48 hours respectively. ResultTime Anhydrite Dihydrate Crystal structure 4 63 37 Fibrous gypsum 7 60 40 Fibrous gypsum 12 58 42 Fibrous gypsum 24 59 41 Fibrous gypsum 48 61 39 Fibrous gypsumThe fibre length was 100 um, the thickness was 1 21um and the width 3 4 um.In other tests the fibrous gypsum obtained had a length of 10 1000 um and a width thickness of 1 3 um. The length of the crystal is preferably 100 200 um and the width thickness 1 3jut. The fibre produced in accordance with the aforegoing is normally extremely long and enables a self binding material to be produced. Thus, the fibre is well suited for use in the manufacture of insulating material, such as building material, furnace insulating material etc. Furthermore, paper containing very high percentage of fibrous gypsum can be produced. Products produced in a sheet former exhibit the same binding properties as cellulose fibres. Cellulose fibres can be admixed with the fibrous gypsum product, in order to obtain satisfactory tear strength. Tests in which products contained 60 and 80 gypsum 40 and 20 cellulose provided satisfactory surface glazed sheet material.Such paper is lighter in weight than paper containing natural gypsum.
