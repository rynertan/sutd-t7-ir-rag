## Description
The present invention relates to unity gain buffer amplifiers and, more particularly, to various circuit arrangements for reducing the input to output offset voltage hereinafter referred to as offset and the offset drift hereinafter referred to as drift as a function of temperature inherent in commonly employed unity gain buffer amplifiers. The present invention is related to the subject matter of US A 4 502 020 entitled Settling Time Reduction in Wide Band Direct Coupled Transistor Amplifiers. A prior art unity gain buffer amplifier of a type commonly employed is illustrated in Figure 1. This prior art circuit has been described by Knitter and Zuch, French patent FR A 1 461 683 discloses a similar buffer amplifier. Japanese Patent Application JP A 5526790 discloses an emitter follower circuit operating as a non complementary class A output stage. This circuit also has poor input to output offset characteristics. The present invention according to Claim 1 provides a unity gain buffer amplifier, the amplifier comprising Such a unity gain buffer amplifier is advantageous over the prior art in that an appropriate adjustment of the ratio of the current sources will achieve a zero offset independent of the small transistor Vbe mismatches. This also reduces the drift since the drift is equal to the offset divided by the temperature T. A similar effect is produced in a circuit arrangement wherein the first current source and the second current source comprise a first resistor ROb and a second resistor ROa respectively. The present invention provides also a unity gain buffer amplifier according to independent Claim 3. A prior art unity gain buffer amplifier circuit together with embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which In the following description the following notation conventions have been used Vbexy is the base emitter voltage Vbe of the transistor labelled Qxy under discussion Icxy is the collector current Ic of the transistor labelled Qxy under discussion and Isxy is the reverse saturation current Is of the transistor labelled Qxy under discussion. Referring now to Figure 1, there is shown a unity gain buffer amplifier circuit constructed in accordance with the prior art. Assuming that the NPN transistors Qnb and Qnc are matched and that the PNP transistors Qpb and Qpc are similarly matched, and further assuming B beta and VA Early voltage are equal in all of the transistors, the offset Referring now to the circuit diagram of Figure 2, there is shown a unity gain buffer amplifier constructed to reduce the offset and drift characteristics. In this circuit, the offset Then, since for a single transistor Vbe Vt ln Ic Is , the offset is equal to Vt ln IcpbIcnaIsncIspd IspbIsnaIcncIcpd ¹, In practice, VA, which describes the effect of base width modulation on Vbe, will not usually be the same for NPN and PNP transistors. With finite values of VA, a smaller Vbe voltage will cause the same collector current Ic to exist. Therefore, to compensate for differing finite values of VA in NPN and PNP transistors, slight differences in the ratio CSa CSb can be used to correct for nonzero offset and drift values caused by VA and Vbe mismatches. Similarly, this technique can be used to reduce offset caused by B mismatches, although drift may not necessarily be reduced in proportion to offset. Referring now to Figure 3, the resistors ROa and ROb cause the ratio Icna Icpa to vary depending on Vi, thus causing the offset and drift to vary. However, in applications where Vi Vcc, those variations may not be a problem in view of the reduced circuit complexity. In order to achieve increased stability in the frequency response of Vo Vi for the circuits of Figures 2 and 3, resistors in series with the bases or emitters in any combination may be useful. The offset and drift characteristics will be changed slightly but a reduction in both may still be achieved. The collectors of transistors Qnc and Qpc are shown connected to Vcc and Vcc, respectively, for use as a buffer circuit. The collectors could also be connected to other circuitry rather than the supply voltage Vcc. An example of this is the use of the circuit of Figure 2 or 3 as a replacement for the input stage consisting of transistors Q0, Q1, and RF2 in Figure 2 of the referenced U.S. A 4 502 020 to offer reduced input offset voltages. A further modified circuit arrangement of similar operation to that shown in Figures 2 and 3 is illustrated in Figure 4.
