## Description
PROCESS This invention relates to a process for manufacturing a cephalosporin derivative. European Patent Publications Nos. 31708 and 55562 describe 7 imidazol 2 yl aminocephalosporin derivatives carrying a variety of radicals at the 3position. One of the methods disclosed therein for the manufacture of those compounds which carry a heterocyclylthiomethyl radical at the 3 position is the reaction of the corresponding 3 acetoxymethyl derivative with the appropriate heterocyclic thiol in a solvent in the presence of boron trifluoride etherate, following the general method described in UK Patent 1,565,941. It has been found, however, that this process gives poor yields of product when the required 3 substituent is lH 1,2,3 triazol 4 yl thiomethyl, and in particular when the object of the process is the compound 7 imidazol 2 yl amino 3 lH 1,2,3 triazol 4 yl thiomethylceph 3 em 4 carboxylic acid EuropeanPatent Publication No. 31708, Example 19 .It has now been found, however, that the above compound may be produced in high yield by operating the general process within controlled conditions. According to the invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of 7 imidazol 2 yl amino 3 lH 1,2,3 triazol 4 yl thiomethySceph 3 em 4 carboxylic acid, and the acid and base addition salts thereof, characterised by reaction of a compound of the formulaI EMI1.1 in which R is a displaceable radical with 4 mercaptolH 1,2,3 triazole or a base addition salt thereof in a diluent or solvent consisting of trifluoroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, acetonitrile or sulpholane, or a mixture of any two or three of these, in the presence of boron trifluoride, or a complex thereof whereafter when the product is obtained as the free base or as a salt, and the salt or free base respectively is required, the interconversion between salt and free base is carried out by conventional means. In the free base form the product of the process will generally exist in the form of the zwitterion. It will be noted that in the chemical name of the product manufactured by the process, and in formula I, the double bonds in the imidazole and triazole rings have been inserted in particular positions. It is to be understood, however, that other tautomeric forms of these heterocyclic residues are possible and these other forms are included within the scope of the process. In particular in the triazole ring the hydrogen atom may be attached to the 1 , 2 or 3 nitrogen atom. 1 A particular value for R is 1 6C alkanoyloxy e.g. acetoxy , chloro, bromo or iodo. The preferred value for R1is acetoxy. A particular acid addition salt of the cephalosporin derivative manufactured by the process of the invention is, for example, a salt formed with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulphuric, citric or maleic acid. A particular base addition salt of the cephalosporin derivative manufactured by the process of the invention is, for example, an alkali metal salt e.g. a sodium or potassium salt , an alkaline earth metal salt e.g. a calcium or magnesium salt , or a salt with a primary, secondary or tertiary organic amine e.g. triethylamine, procaine, dibenzylamine and N,N1 dibenzylethylenediamine, and other amines which have been used to form salts with cephalosporins . Though the 4 mercapto lH 1,2,3 triazole may be used as such, in this form it has explosive properties, and it is preferably used in the form of a base addition salt, e.g. the sodium salt. The free thiol may be liberated from this salt in situ. It is preferable to use equimolar amounts of the triazole and the compound of the formula I. The boron trifluoride is preferably used in the form of a complex, e.g. a complex with a dialkyl ether such as diethyl ether, di n propyl ether or di n butyl ether, with an amine such as ethylamine, n propylamine, isopropylamine, n butylamine or triethanolamine, with an aliphatic acid such as acetic or propionic acid, with a nitrile such as acetonitrile or propionitrile, with a carboxylic ester such as methyl formate, ethyl formate or ethyl acetate, with a phenol such as phenol or with sulpholane. The preferred complex is that with sulpholane. It is preferable to use the boron trifluoride in excess, for example up to 20 fold excess. The preferred range is 5 12 fold excess. The process may be carried out over the temperature range Q0 C to 60 C, preferably in the range 5 C. to 40 C., and most preferably in the range 5 C. to 100C. Although the process of the invention will proceed under essentially anhydrous conditions, the rate of reaction is considerably accelerated by the presence of water. A suitable amount of water is in the range 0.3 to 5 molar equivalents of the compound of the formula I, and a preferred amount is in the range 1 to 2.5 molar equivalents. When trichloroacetic acid or sulpholane is used as the sole solvent it is preferable, because of the melting points of these solvents 57 580C. and 27.50C. respectively , to use an additional diluent in order to achieve and maintain the fluidity and mobility of the reaction mixture at the operating temperature.A suitable diluent is methylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform or diethyl ether. The preferred diluent for use with sulpholane is methylene chloride. The reaction mixture may be worked up by conventional means, for example by drowning out the reaction mixture into a diluent in which the product is insoluble, followed by purification of the resulting precipitate by chromatography or by some other means.Alternatively the reaction mixture may be drowned out into water, the aqueous mixture optionally extracted with a water immiscible organic solvent, and the product isolated from the aqueous solution by column chromatography. The invention is illustrated, but not limited, by the following Examples. The yields quoted are to be regarded as illustrative rather than limiting. The temperatures are in degress Centigrade.
