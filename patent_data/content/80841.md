# Dual coupler fiber optic recirculating memory.

## Abstract
A fiber optic recirculating memory is disclosed which utilizes dual couplers 110, 210 to form a splice free recirculating memory device from a length of single mode optical fiber 112 forming a loop 140 which acts as a delay line and a second length of single mode optical fiber 130 which provides an input end 132 and an output end 134 for the device. A single signal supplied as an input to the device will result in a series of output signals identical to the input signal, although at smaller, decreasing amplitudes the invention prevents the first output signal from being sub stantially larger than the rest of the output signals, thus eliminating the need for protective circuitry on the output end 134 or the rejection of the first output signal. In addition to being useful as a recirculating memory device for use in a system where data is generated at a rate faster than it can be accepted by a data processor, the invention may be used as a tap filter to pass a selected fundamental frequency and its harmonics, and to attenuate all other frequencies.
