# Device for controlling recording track jump operations.

## Abstract
A device for controlling recording track jump operations is activated to move a light beam radially over a disk from an initial track to a target track. Circuiting is provided for com pensation in the event of overshooting the target track. A jump signal generating circuit is provided to reduce the traversing speed when the light beam is a selected number of tracks away from the target track. Alternatively, the speed is gradually reduced as the beam moves from the initial track to the target track.
