## Description
PROCESS FOR PURIFYING AND SEPARATING VITAMIN B12This invention relates to a process for purifying and separating vitamin B12 and more particularly to such a process for the recovery of vitamin B12 in pure form from vitamin B12 containing liquids having impurities, such as those obtained by a fermentation method, a cellular extraction method and similar methods.A typical process of the type stated above is known, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4 383 110, in which vitaminB12 of high purity is recovered from a vitamin B12 containing liquid by an adsorp tion elution operation.In this known process, a starting crude liquid containing vitamin B12 and impurities is brought into contact with an adsorbent such as a divinylbenzene styrene copolymer resin, and vitamin B12 is caused to be adsorbed to the adsorbent resin. The vitamin B12 adsorbed is then eluted with an eluent such as a hydrous alcohol having an alcohol content of 50 or less, and the active eluate is finally collected.However, such prior art process is not satisfactory in that vitamin B12 can be eluted only at a low rate from the adsorbent resin with a hydrous alcohol, such as 50 aqueous methanol, 40 aqueous ethanol or 20 aqueous isopropanol, resulting in increased consumption of the alcohol to facilitate the eluting operation. Another, more serious problem is that the active eluate thus obtained is diluted in its vitamin B12 concentration and, of recrystallised requires further concentration, with added plant and expense.Where it.is desired that vitamin B12 be recovered at a rate of say, more than 98 or even maximum 100 , this dilution of vitamin B12 concentration has been found to be extremely disadvantageous. This difficulty is to be eliminated or at least alleviated to obtain industrially and economically satisfactory results.Another process has also been proposed in which vitaminB12 is recovered at high purity from a vitamin B12containing liquid having impurities by an adsorptionwashing elution operation. A starting liquid containing vitamin B12 and impurities is brought into contact with an adsorbent such as a divinylbenzene styrene copolymer resin at a temperature of 100 300, and vitamin B12 is caused to be adsorbed to the resin.The resin is then washed with water, or a hydrous alcohol having an alcohol content of less than 20 , or an aqueous low acidity solution The latter may comprise a hydrous alcohol such as 20 aqueous methanol ,10 aqueous ethanol or 5 aqueous isopropanol, or an aqueous low acidity solution such as 1 aqueous phoshoric acid, 1 aqueous acetic acid, 1 aqueous boric acid or 0.1 aqueous hydrochloric acid, which may be used in combination depending on the types and quantities of the impurities. Adsorbed vitamin B12 is then eluted with a suitable eluent to collect the active eluate.The prior art process just mentioned has a drawback in that vitamin B12 in the active eluate is not satisfactory pure even after the resin which has adsorbed vitamin B12 is washed with large amounts of these treating fluids. It is also to be noted that, the hydrous alcohol may cause partial desorption from the resin of the vitamin B12.Yield loss of vitamin B12 has been found to be particularly high when the liquids containing vitamin B12 are obtained by a fermentation method or a cellular extraction method, which liquids usually contain relatively large amounts of impurities.It has now been discovered that certain specific types of eluents such as lower ketones, lower esters and lower ethers enable vitamin B12 to be eluted at a high rate with use of smaller amounts of such eluents, that is about 1 5 to 1 15 times that required in the prior art processes. Moreover, since such eluents ensure a 5 to 15 fold increase in vitamin B12 concentrations in the active eluate, vitamin B12 can be recrystallized, when desired, without the need for any additional concentration treatment. Even with yields as high as 98 100 , the purity of vitamin B12 is increased 3 to 10 fold, and hence no concentration technique nor any additional purifying means, nor preparatory purifying means is necessary.Consequently, vitamin B12 can be separated and recovered at a satisfactory recovery rate of greater than 98 , even sometimes 100 , by simple and easy adsorption and elution operations without any additional or pre purifying operation.It has also been discovered that treatment before elution with a treatment fluid such as purified water, being deionized water or distilled water, or aqueous low acidity solutions, having a temperature of 300 700C, can assist in the elution of vitamin B12.Furthermore, these treatment fluids have a selective ability to impart a satisfactory purity to vitamin B12 in the active eluate. Vitamin B12 of high purity, for example between 30 and 80 , can thus be separated and recovered simply by adsorbing, washing and eluting operations. No additional purification or prepurification operation is required. The present invention seeks to provide a process for purifying and separating vitamin B12 which is free of the above noted difficulties of the prior art processes and which is efficient, simple and easy.The present invention further seeks to provide such a process by which vitamin B12 can be separated and recovered in optional degrees of purity, yield and recovery with use of such eluents and treating fluids that are specified hereunder without the need for additional purifying and or pre purifying operation.According to the present invention, there is provided a process for the separation of vitamin B12, which comprises a bringing a vitamin B12 containing liquid having impurities into contact with a divinylbenzene styrene copolymer resin b causing vitamin B12 to be adsorbed to said resin c eluting said adsorbed vitamin B12 with an eluent, said eluent being an aqueous solution containing a compound selected from the group consisting of a lower ketone, a lower ester and a lower ether, and d collecting the active eluate.A resin useful as an adsorbent in the process of this invention is a copolymer obtained by copolymerizing divinylbenzene, styrene and a functional derivitive thereof as repeating units, or a copolymer derived by copolymerizing divinylbenzene, styrene and a functional unsaturated alkyl ester of an aromatic polycarboxylic acid represented by the formula,EMI5.1 wherein R is a C3 C10 unsaturated alkyl moiety having a carbon carbon double bond and n is an integer of 2 or 3. This resin is hereinafter referred to as DST for brevity.These copolymers can be produced by copolymerizing the above monomers and ester compound in the presence of a radical polymerization initiator commonly used in the art. The content of the styrene monomer in each of the copolymers is preferably in the range of 30 to 80 by weight, preferably 45 to 70 by weight, based on the total amount of the divinylbenzene and styrene monomers. The content of the unsaturated alkyl ester of an aromatic polycarboxylic acid is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 30 by weight, preferably 1 to 10 by weight, based on the total amount of the divinylbenzene and styrene monomers, and upon the alkyl ester. The invention will now to illustrated by examples thereof.A vitamin B12 containing liquid having impurities is brought into contact with an adsorbent resin, and vitamin B12 is caused to be adsorbed to the resin.Subsequently, the resin which has adsorbed vitamin B12 is washed with a treating fluid. The vitamin B12 thus adsorbed is eluted with an eluent, and the active eluate is finally collected. Exemplary crude liquids containing vitamin B12 are a liquid obtained by extracting vitamin B12 accumulated in the culture broth or cultivated microbial cells which results from aerobically or anaerobically cultivating a known vitamin B12 producing microorganism in a nutrient medium, with hot water of 800C, or a liquid obtained by destroying the cellular membranes of the vitamin B12 containing cultivated microbial cells by mechanical or ultrasonic means.Exemplary vitamin B12 producing microorganisms include microorganisms belonging to the generaPropionibacterium, Streptomyces, Arthrobacter,Corynebacterium, Rhodopseudomonas, Mycobacterium andPseudomonas.Any suitable contacting means can be used which permits full contact of the vitamin B12 containing liquid with the adsorbent resin. For example, a batch method is useful in which the adsorbent is mixed with the vitaminB12 containing liquid, and if desired, the admixture is stirred to effect contact of the two. There may also be employed a column chromatographic method which involves filling the resin in a suitable column and allowing the vitamin B12 containing liquid to pass through the resin filled layer.In the case of the batch method, the pH of the vitaminB12 containing liquid is adjusted for example to about 5 8, preferably about 7, and added with the adsorbent in a suitable amount, for example, about 1 to about 50 vol vol. Thereafter, the admixture is gently stirred for a period between 10 minutes and 2 hours, usually for 20 minutes to 1 hour. The adsorption operation may be carried out at room temperature, but is preferably as low as possible, for example, about 100 to about 300c.The column chromatographic method can also be carried out by passing the vitamin B12 containing liquid through the resin filled layer under pH and temperature conditions similar to those employed in the batch method.After the adsorbing step, the resin which has adsorbed vitamin B12 is washed with a treatment fluid having a temperature of 300 700C, preferably 400 600C.Treatment fluids useful for the invention include, for example, purified water such as deionized water and distilled water, and an aqueous low acidity solution in purified water. Such treatment fluid has a good affinity for the impurities adhering to the surface of the adsorbent resin and these can be selectively stripped from the resin with utmost efficiency and without desorbing vitamin B12. In contrast, the treatment fluid employed in the above mentioned prior art process is poor in its affinity for the impurities.Acids for the aqueous low acidity solution useful for the invention include, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, boric acid and the like, and organic acids such as acetic acid, malic acid and the like. By the term low acidity solution is meant a solution having an acid concentration of less than 5 by weight, preferably up to 1 by weight.Impurities include, for example, aliphatic carboxylic acid salts such sodium acetate, sodium propionate, sodium butyrate, sodium valerate and the like, amino acids such as glutamic acid, aspartic acid, proline, leucine, alanine and the like, saccharoses such as glucose, fructose, ribose, galactose and the like, and nucleic acid salts such as adenine, cytosine, thymine uracil and the like. For example, the solubility of these impurities in water is greater by about 1.3 to 3.0 times at 500C than at 250C.Purified water, which includes distilled water and deionized water containing no water soluble organic solvent, is also usable. Use of such purified water, unlike the known conventional hydrous alcohols, dispenses with recovering means and gives rise to commercial advantages. Deionized water is preferably 100 x 104 ohm.cm or greater in its resistivity when measured by treatment at an upward rate of 1 ton day in a tower filled with a conventional ion exchange resin such for example as Amberlite IR 120B or Amberlite IRA410 Rohm Haas Co. .The treatment fluid may be properly selected depending on the types and amounts of impurities, and the types of adsorbent resins.After the washing step, adsorbed vitamin B12 is eluted with an eluent. Eluents useful for the invention include agueous solutions of lower ketones, lower esters and lower ethers, all of which compounds should have 2 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably 3 to 7 carbon atoms. Specific example of such compounds include lower ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, methyl isobutyl ketone and the like, lower esters such as isopropyl acetate, n propyl acetate and the like, and lower ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl either, 1,4 diozane, diisopropyl ether, dimethyl cellosolve, diethyl cel losolve and the like. The concentration of these eluting solutions is usually in the range of 1 to 50 by volume, preferably 5 to 40 by volume.A choice of eluents also depends on the types and amounts of impurities and the type of adsorbent resins used.The eluting operation can be performed at room temperature, and heating or cooling is not particularly required. Where found desirable, heating or cooling may be effected, for example, within a temperature range of about 200 to about 600C.By the above procedure, the active eluste is obtained, and if desired, recrystallized or otherwise worked up without the need for any concentrating operation.A fuller understanding of the invention will be had from the following specific examples which are provided for purposes of illustration only and are not to be construed as limiting to the invention.
