# Process for evaporative stripping.

## Abstract
For removing volatile components from liquid material the liquid material is passed through a confined passageway, having three predetermined portions, is heated within the first portion under pressure and temperature conditions whereby the volatile components are maintained below their boiling point, is then continuously passed into and through the second portion which is partially restricting the fluid flow, and is then immediately passed into the third portion which is arranged and configured to provide a relatively elongated, narrow passage having a high ratio of surface area to volume of fluid flow and a predetermined configuration to impart a turbulent flow to the liquid material. The pressure and velocity of the fluid flow within the third portion are maintained thus that volatile components rapidly vaporize in a flashing action as the liquid material passes from the first portion through the second portion and into the third portion of the confined passageway whereby the vaporized volatile components form a high velocity flow carrying the liquid material in atomized droplet form.
