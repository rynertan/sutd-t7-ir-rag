# Production of alkali metal sulfates.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for the production of alkali metal sulfates from an aqueous solution containing alkali metal hydrogen sulfate which comprises contacting the aqueous solution of alkali metal hydrogen sulfate with a hydrophilic solvent, the hydrophilic solvent being effective to extract at least a portion of the sulfuric acid formed during the conver sion of the alkali metal hydrogen sulfate to alkali metal sulfate in the solution together with at least a portion of the water present permitting the alkali metal sulfate solid to crystallize and recovering the solid alkali metal sulfate product. The hydrophilic solvent may then be extracted and separated from the sulfuric acid with a hydrophobic solvent and both solvents can be recovered and recycled.
