# Detergency builder system.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a highly effective detergency builder system comprising the combination of a particular ether carboxylate sequestering agent and particular types of dispersing anti redeposition agent. Such a selected ether carboxylate is oxydisuccinic acid or oxydisuccinate. Such particular dispersing anti redeposition agents can include salts of acrylic acid based polymers and co polymers or can include certain ethoxylated amine materials. This selected combination of a particular ether carboxylate sequestering agent and particular dispersing anti redeposition agents provide an especially useful builder system for use in phosphorus free detergent or laundry additive products.
