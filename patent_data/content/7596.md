# Capacitive pressure sensor.

## Abstract
A capacitive pressure sensor includes at least one stationary substrate 201a, 201b and a diaphragm 202 having a portion movable with respect to the substrate, a pressure chamber 205a, 205b being defined between the diaphragm and the at least one substrate and filled with a fluid exposed to the pressure to be detected. The diaphragm 203 is formed of silicon as an electrically conductive material, thus serving as one electrode of the capacitive sensor. The opposite electrode or electrodes 202a, 202b are plated on the surfaces of the substrate or substrates facing the diaphragm, when the substrate or substrates are made of insulating material such as borosilicate glass, quartz, soft glass or sapphire. In this case, the diaphragm is directly bonded to the substrate or substrates. In an alternative, the substrate or substrates are also formed of silicon, thus themselves forming the opposite electrode or electrodes of the capacitive sensor. In this case, spacers of insulating material such as borosilicate glass, quartz, soft glass or sapphire, are bonded between the diaphragm and the substrate or substrates.
