# METHOD OF TRANSFERRING DIGITAL SIGNAL.

## Abstract
A digital signal transferring method wherein in a serial transfer of a digital data signal of N channel N represents 16, 24, 32, for example , the digital data is divided into groups each consisting of data of K channel K represents 8, for example and successively and repeatedly transferred in sequence every M groups M represents 2,3,4 for example . A preamble having such a pattern as violating regulations of the modulation system in the transfer of the data is disposed at, for example, the top of each of the groups. In addition, a data significance evaluation bit is added to every data for each of the channels, and each of the groups is provided with a parity data with respect to all the bits in the group, thereby to effect a signal transfer. Further, each of the groups may be provided with a group address for indicating where the group is in the M groups.
