# Clock driver.

## Abstract
The cross coupled, latch type clock driver circuit enables the carrying out of level sensitive scan design LSSD testing. During normal operation, the circuit functions to prevent a pair of input clock waveforms Ao, Bo from overlapping. This is achieved by applying a low state to a control signal input T0 which causes the circuit to perform a latching operation on the input clock waveforms Ao, Bo by provid ing a conductive cross coupled connection between first and second NOR gates 2, 4 connected to the input clock waveforms Ao, Bo . Then the outputs of the NOR gates 2, 4 will be ensured to be non overlapping. During the test mode, the input clock waveforms Ao, Bo , must not be latched, in order for LSSD testing to be carried out. This is achieved by applying a high state to the control signal input T0 , which disables the cross coupled connection between the NOR gates 2, 4 . The circuit then becomes transparent to the input clock waveforms Ao, Bo , enabling testing operations to be performed. The transition of the circuit from its normal mode to its test mode is carried out with a staged delay operation to prevent inadvertent current surges.
