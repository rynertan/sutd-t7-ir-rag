# A method and an arrangement for the compensation of inertia forces in the indexing movement of a machine element.

## Abstract
When machine elements 1 having a large mass shall be indexed, i.e. subjected to short, quick rotating move ments, very great acceleration and deceleration forces must be transmitted via the driving means of the machine. Due to vibrations occurring, increasing the stresses on the driving means, this must be dimensioned accordingly. The present invention suggests a method and an arrangement for the compensation of the forces supplied and thus re ducing the stresses occurred. This is performed by com bining the indexing machine 1 element with a cam disc 6 which is affected by a number of spring loaded 13 cam followers 9, 10 , whereby the cam disc 6 has such a shape that the cam follower 9, 10 decelerate and acce lerate the cam disc 6 following the desired movement pattern of the machine element 1 .
