# Cross linked polyarylene oxide membranes.

## Abstract
Covalently bonded, cross linked polymeric gas separa tion membranes of a polyarylene oxide precursor and a chemical cross linking agent. Apparatus and processes utilizing such membranes for selectively separating at least one gas from a gaseous mixture by permeation. Membranes include substituted phenylene oxide poly mers cross linked with ammonia.
