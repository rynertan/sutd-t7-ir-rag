# Process for producing silicon carbide whisker.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a process for producing silicon carbide whisker by mixing a silicon source with carbon black and subjecting the resultant mixture to heating treatment in an inert atmosphere, which comprises using a silica recovered from geothermal hot water as said silicon source. The process of the present invention can bring about the effects such as 1 being capable of producing SiC whiskers with slender diameters and small variance of lengths, 2 contribution to effective utilization of resources by utilizing the recovered silica from geothermal hot water as the silicon source, etc. and its industrial value is great as the method for providing SiC whisker reinforcing material for various kinds of composite materials.
