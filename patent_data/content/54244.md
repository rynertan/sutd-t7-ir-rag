# Solid state imaging device.

## Abstract
A solid stage imaging device comprises an array of picture elements 1,2 and a horizontal CTD shift register 18 28 38 48 . In a horizontal blanking period, two or more sets of signals from vertical signal output lines 4 coupled to the picture element array are stored in the horizontal CTD shift register. In a horizontal scanning period, the horizontal CTD shift register operates in a 3 phase or 2 phase or 4 phase driving fashion to deliver picture image information signal to its output part.
