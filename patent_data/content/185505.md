A ceiling 4 has opposite end edges 24, 25 connected with the upper edges of the sidewall panels 2, 3 , and spans the sidewall panels. The office module 1 has a height and girth which are substan tially smaller than the respective dimensions of an open office space, so that the office module can be easily transported and placed at any desired location within the room. The ceiling 4 is positioned well above the head height of the average user. A further side section 41 and end section 42 may be provided to provide a reception area.
