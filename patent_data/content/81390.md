# Continuous speech recognition system.

## Abstract
A continuous speech recognition system for recognizing input speech composed of a plurality of words continuously spoken comprises speech analyzing means for analyzing an input signal at every given frame time point m and outputting an input pattern expressed in a time series of a feature vector consisting of a predetermined number of feature parameters an input pattern memory to store said input pattern a reference pattern memory a distance calculating means to calculate the distance between the feature vector at a time point m varied from start point to end point M of said input pattern and the feature vector an asymptotic calculating means to calculate a similarity measure D v, n given by the cumulative sum of said distance at said time points n and a path information F v, n indicating a time point of the input pattern a digit similarity measure and digit path information calculating means to select a minimum similarity measure from among the similarity measures at the end time points of reference patterns of all the words obtained through said asymptotic calculating means an initializing means to give said digit similarity measure DB m 1 at a time point m 1 as an initial value of said similarity measure and to give a time point as an initial value of said path information in said asymptotic calculating means and a decision means to obtain a recognized result as a final digit from said digit recognition category W M at the end point M of said input pattern.
