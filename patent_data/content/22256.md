# Coated cookware with FEP topcoat.

## Abstract
Cookware coated with two or more layers of heat stable polymer in which the topcoat uses a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene as the heat stable polymer. This permits curing at lower temperatures and without the need for heat decomposable auxiliary polymers normally used in topcoats containing polytetrafluoroethylene.

## Claims

## Description
TITLE COATED COOKWARE WITH FEP TOPCOAT BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to coated cookware having a heat stable multi layer nonstick coating. Superior performance in cookware coatings is obtained using multi layer coatings in which the topcoat contains polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE along with a heat decomposable auxiliary polymer, such as an acrylic polymer, which aids in coalescing the PTFE into a less porous coating at lower temperatures than would be feasible without the auxiliary polymer. It is desirable to be able to form cookware coatings which are less porous without the need for heat decomposable auxiliary polymers. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a cookware article comprising a substrate coated with a heatstable coating system having at least two layers, said layers including a primer layer in direct contact with the substrate and which adheres the coating system to the substrate and comprises a polymer stable at temperatures above 3000C, and a topcoat layer comprising a heat stable polymer and optionally pigments and mica or pigment coated mica, in which the heat stable polymer consists essentially of a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It has been found that a copolymer of tetra fluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene, preferably about 85 tetrafluoroethylene and 158 hexafluoropropylene FEP , can be used as the heat stable polymer in the topcoat of a cookware coating system having two or more layers The FEP can be coalesced at relatively low temperatures without the need for heat decomposable auxiliary polymers to act as a coalescing aid.
