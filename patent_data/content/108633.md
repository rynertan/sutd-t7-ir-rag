## Description
ASSAY FOR QUALITATIVELY AND OR QUANTITATIVELY MEASURING hLH OR hCG BODY FLUIDS AND REAGENTS THEREFOR BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION For various reasons, it is highly desirable to be able to qualitatively and or quantitatively measure human luteinizing hormone hLH and human chorionic gonadotropin hCG in a convenient, reliable manner.For example, it is known that the concentration of hLH in female biological fluids increases dramatically just prior to ovulation. A convenient, qualitative detector of the hLH surge for at home use could pinpoint the time of ovulation for women with fertility problems and or aid in fertility regulation.Also, a quantitative hLH assay, which could be used by the physician in the office would be useful in the medical evaluation and observation of various conditions associated with hLH presence and or concentration variation. Similarly, significant presence of hCG in the female biological fluids has been accepted as one of the most reliable tests confirming pregnancy. hCG is secreted by the developing blastocyst and can be detected in pregnant women as early as 7 to 9 days after fertilization. Again, a qualitative at home pregnancy test capable of providing a reliable result within the first two weeks of pregnancy would be extremely useful. Also, a convenient assay procedure usable by the practicing physician would prove of benefit in the diagnosis and evaluation of various abnormal conditions characterized by hCG levels, such as in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion, and in the follow up of patients with trophoblastic disease and infertility problems. One aspect of the present application is concerned with improved solid phase assay systems and methods for measuring hLH and or hCG, which do not require radioactive substances. In one embodiment of the present invention, an enzymatic marker is employed. In another embodiment, a direct dye marker is used to eliminate the step of reacting enzyme with its substrate for measurement. Another aspect of the present application is concerned with materials and reagents to be used in the improved assay systems and methods. Van Weeman et al, 11 Immunoassay Using AntigenEnzyme Conjugate , FEBS Letters, 15 232 1971 , conjugated hCG to horseradish peroxidase through glutaraldehyde and then used the conjugate for enzyme immunoassay of hCG. A solid phase assay procedure is disclosed by Van Weeman et al where hCG antibody is attached to a cellulosic support reprecipitated and diazotized m aminobenzyloxymethyl cellulose or microcrystalline cellulose activated by CnBr. Also, seeU.S. 3,654,090 using the Van Weeman conjugate in similar assay procedures. Another enzyme used in the art in place of horseradish peroxidase is alkaline phosphatase ALP . For example, see Engvall et al, Enzyme linked Immunoabsorbent Assay ELISA , Quantitative Assay of Immunoglobulin G , Immunochemistry, 8 871 1971 .Kawaoi et al, An Improved Method of Conjugation of Peroxidase with Protein. Fed.Proc., 32 Abstract 840 1973 also disclose a method for forming an enzyme hormone complex. Saxena et al, Development of a Solid PhaseCentrifugation free Enzyme Assay for LH for OvulationDetection , Psychoneuroendocrinology in Reproduction,Zichella et al, editors, Elsevier North Holland 1979 , p. 277, describe both an enzymeimmunoassay and an enzymereceptorassay for hLH using antibody coupled glass beads or receptor coupled glass beads, respectively glutaraldehyde activated aminopropyl glass beads and an hLH alkaline phosphatase conjugate 4 azidobenzoyl derivative of hLH . The receptor used by Saxena et al was of relatively low yield and suffered from poor stability. Carlsson et al, Protein Thiolation and Reversible Protein Protein Conjugation , Biochem. J., 173 723 1978 , disclose that N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP can be employed as a heterobifunctional reagent in forming protein protein conjugates through a disulfide link. As one example,Carlsson et al form a horseradish peroxidase rabbit anti human transferrin antibody conjugate. In general, 2 pyridyl disulfide structures are introduced into both the peroxidase and the antibodies by their reaction with SPDP. Although either of the 2 pyridyldisulfide moieties can be converted into the corresponding thiol derivative by specific reduction with dithiothreitol at pH 4.5, Carlsson et al formed the thiolated antibodies and reacted them with the peroxidase 2 pyridyl disulfide derivative by thiol disulfide exchange to produce the peroxidase enzyme antibody conjugate. It is also known that hLH and hCG consist of two noncovalently linked polypeptide chains classified as a and ss subunits. The a subunits of these glycoprotein hormones, as well as the a subunits of other glycoprotein hormones, have almost identical amino acid sequences and are practically indistinguishable immunochemically. In contrast, the g subunits of each have their own distinctive amino acid sequences which differentiate them from the p subunits of the other glycoproteins. Methods are known to purify antibody, such as hCG ss antiserum, to reduce cross reactivity with hCG a subunits or with similar hLH subunits.For example, see Jibiki et al, A Receptor Immunoassay for the Determination of the Specificity of Anti hCG p Sera , ACTA Endocrinologica, 87, 838 1978 , where hCG p antisera is purified by immunoabsorption with hLH and hCG a. Saito et al, Use of Receptors in the Preparation of LH Free Serum , J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 43 1186 1976 , used purified gonadotropin receptor to bind serum hLH to the exclusion of other serum proteins.This general technique provides a purer serum, depending upon the specificity of the receptor. Glass beads have been used as the solid phase in the radioimmunoassay of hormones such as hLH and hCG.See Post et al, A Rapid, Centrifugation Free Radioimmunoassay Specific for Human Chorionic GonadotropinUsing Glass Beads as Solid Phase , J. Clin. Endoclinol. Metab., 50 169 1980 , where solid glass beads of 6 mm diameter were sandblasted and then heated in the presence of y aminopropyltriethoxysilane to generate reactive alkylamino groups on the glass surface. The amino groups are activated with glutaraldehyde and subsequently hCG F antibody is covalently coupled thereto. Finally, a key reagent in an hLH or hCG receptor assay is the receptor itself. Heretofore, large quantities of the common hLH and hCG receptor of the corpora lutea have not been obtained in sufficiently pure form for use in enzyme receptor assays of good reliability and accuracy. See Khan et al, Use ofPurified Gonaddtropin Receptor in the Development of an Enzyme Receptorassay ERA for Luteinizing Hormone LH and Human Chorionic Gonadotropin hCG , EnzymeLabelled Immunoassay of Hormones and Drugs, S.B. Pal, editor, de Gruyler Co. 1978 . A number of the steps used in the receptor puri fication system of the present invention, the present invention resulting in a good yield of a receptor having better stability and higher purity, were disclosed by the inventors in the symposium paper Functional Correlates of Hormone Receptors in Reproduction , Mahesh et al, editors, page 397, ElsevierNorth Holland 1980 , presented October 15, 1980. U.S. 4,016,250 and as a divisional thereof,U.S. 4,094,963, both to Saxena, disclose receptorassay methods for determining hCG and or hLH in a biological fluid wherein binding of said hCG and hLH in the sample is with a plasma membrane extract from the corpus luteum of a species possessing the common receptor for hCG and hLH. The additional purification steps disclosed herein, as compared to the Saxena patents, result in the preparation of a receptor material of significantly higher purity and and.binding capacity. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide improved solid phase receptor based and antibody based assays for qualitatively detecting hLH or hCG. Another object of this invention is to provide improved solid phase receptor based and antibody based assays for quantitatively determining hLH or hCG level. A further object of this invention is to provide at home tests usable by women to detect ovulation or pregnancy in a reliable, convenient manner. Still another object of this invention is to provide improved solid phase assays for hLH and hCG which can be used in a quantitative fashion by the practicing physician in his office. Another object of this invention is to provide an improved, substantially pure hLH and hCG receptor, and a process for obtaining it. A further object of this invention is to.provide an improved enzyme hormone conjugate and processes for obtaining it. In accordance with the present invention, a substantially pure and stable hLH hCG receptor is obtained from bovine corpora lutea, in large yields, through the use of a novel, sequential concentration and purification method. This novel, substantially pure gonadotropin receptor is not only used as a receptor in the enzyme receptorassay embodiment of this invention but can also be used to purify hLH and hCG so that substantially pure hormone is used in the preparation of enzyme hormone complexes used as standard reagents in both the enzyme receptor assay hereinafter ERA and the enzymeimmunoassay hereinafter EIA of this invention.It is preferred to use the enzymeimmunoassay approach specific antibody instead of receptor in the pregnancy test based on hCG level since some hLH would also be present in the patient s biological fluids. The enzyme receptorassay is specific for the ovulation detection test embodiment since hCG should not be present in significant quantities in the healthy non pregnant woman. Of course, both EIA and ERA can be used for hCG or hl H detection. hLH in pregnancy would be of a very low level. In one embodiment of the present invention, a known, predetermined amount of hLH enzyme conjugate is incubated with a reactive quantity of receptor coupled to a solid phase, such as glass beads, in the presence of the standard or unknown. The receptor level is sufficient to be reactive with the expected surge level of hLH at ovulation. Upon separation of the solid phase from the supernatant containing any unreacted or displaced hormone enzyme conjugate and subsequent measurement of the enzyme by its catalysis of a color forming reaction, a color is formed in the supernatant indicating ovulation or less color is formed in the solid phase since a proportionate amount of the conjugate bound to the solid phase will be displaced by the hLH. An analogous at home test for pregnancy can be based on hCG detection. However, in the pregnancy test, it is preferred that purified hCG F antibody be used in place of the receptor because of the presence of some hLH in the body fluids which would also react with receptor. Other variations of the invention will become apparent from the Detailed Description of the Invention hereinafter. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The Figure of the Drawing is a flow diagram of a specific example of the receptor purification method of this invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONReceptor Preparation The Figure of the Drawing is a flow diagram of a specific example of the receptor preparation method of this invention. The receptors for hLH and hCG are the same and are located in the plasma membrane of the endocrine responsive gonadal cells. The above referenced Functional Correlates ofHormone Receptors in Reproduction describes some of the prior art work in this field. The receptor purification method of this invention will be described with reference to the use of bovine corpora lutea as the starting material. It is expected that other known receptor source materials such as rat Leydig cells, pseudopregnant rat ovaries and so on could be substituted for the bovine corpora lutea. Bovine corpora lutea was chosen to provide greater amounts of receptor compared with other source material. Previous work had shown that the receptor is relatively insoluble, but detergent solubilizable in aqueous media In this work, a supernate from a bovine corpora lutea homogenate was used as the starting material. Corpora lutea are homogenized for 15 to 20 seconds in a Tris HCl buffer, containing 15 sucrose in a tissue to buffer ratio of 1 10 w v to yield a homogenate which is centrifuged for 30 minutes at 1,000 rpm to remove cell debris. The supernate is then centrifuged at 7,000 x g to yield a sediment and a supernate, both containing receptor.In practice, the sediment has a binding capacity nearly 5 times that of the supernate and is used in the preparation of Biocept GS radioreceptorassay pregnancy test kits by Wampole Laboratories, Princeton,N.J. The supernate, which would otherwise be discarded, is used as the starting material herein.Obviously, the more active sediment could be detergent solubilized and or combined with supernatant and or the supernatant from the 1,000 rpm centrifugation could be employed as a receptor source material.Although in the specific example hereinbelow, a 7,000 x g supernate was employed, obviously other solubilized fractions could be employed and conveniently tested for the presence of the receptor through a radioimmunoassay or similar technique. The liquid fraction, after separation from the homogenate is concentrated by ultrafiltration. AHI 50 hollow fiber cartridge cutoff level of 50,000 molecular weight was employed in an AMICON DC 10 unit, available from Amicon of Lexington, Mass. to remove an inhibitor of hormone receptor binding and inert proteins of below 50,000 molecular weight. This step yields a concentrated supernatant. Previous work had estimated the molecular weight of the receptor to be within the 110,000 to 115,000 range. Next, the concentrated supernatant is fractionated, primarily to remove high density inactive protein and light density lipid. Preparative sucrose linear density gradient ultracentrifugation has been found to be a useful technique to separate inactive materials from the receptor. Using a linear sucrose gradient from 35 to 10 , it was found that the fractions eluted between 18 28 sucrose gradient contained nearly all of the active receptor. Since the sucrose should be removed, ultrafiltration is again carried out followed by ultracentrifugation to yield a sediment containing the receptor material. In order to remove additional extraneous lipid materials, further separatory purification is carried out by re dispersing the sediment in water with the aid of a surface active agent detergent and extracting with an organic solvent such as petroleum ether.Following extraction, which mostly removes neutral lipids and low affinity high capacity binding sites, the aqueous phase is separated from any insoluble residue. It is believed that other organic solvents could be tried in place of the petroleum ether and some of them would function in an equivalent manner to petroleum ether. However, the present inventors have found that ethanol, methanol, carbon tetrachloride and butanol do not perform in a satisfactory manner. Our earlier work and the literature contains evidence that the hLH hCG receptor consists of a binding subunit and an associated subunit of an adenyl cyclase and that these subunits can be readily separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, andSepharose 6B chromatography of the detergent solubilized receptor, Khan et al, supra. Since it is also necessary to separate out the surface active agent from the receptor and to purify the receptor further, multi stage gel filtration chromatography was carried out to separate the binding fraction from the adenylate. cyclase activity fraction, from the majority of the 5l nucleotidase activity and from the surface active agent. Additional protein separation was then carried out using electrophoresis, more specifically in the example herein vertical zone electrophoresis on a cellulose column. Zone electrophoresis on a cellulose block has been tried with some success but does not appear useful for large scale purification. The active fractions were combined and re chromatographed. Finally, immunoaffinity column chromatography on hCG bound hCG antibody directly coupled to the chromatography matrix was carried out to complete the purification of the receptor material. Since in work to date the immunoaffinity column chromatography increases activity only slightly, the zone electrophoresis product may have reached a practical limit of purity.Direct affinity chromatography and indirect immunoaffinity chromatography can be used in place of electrophoresis, but to date protein recovery has been too low from a practical standpoint. These procedures result in the preparation of a purified receptor protein similar to that obtained from zone electrophoresis, but different in amino acid analysis. In addition, it is not believed that the products obtained by either of the affinity chromatography procedures is electrophoretically homogenous electrophoretically pure The following example illustrates preparation of the improved receptor of this invention. In this example, a detergent Triton X 100 was used to solubilize the receptor protein.Through experimentation we found that a minimum concentration of 0.35 Triton X 100 was necessary to keep the receptor in a soluble state at a concentration of 240 mg protein per ml. Example 1 1200 bovine ovaries stored at 600C were thawed.The corpora lutea therefrom were homogenized for 15 to 20 seconds in 0.1 M Tris HC1 buffer pH 7.4 buffer containing lmM each of CaC12, MgCl2 and dithiothreitol, 0.01 sodium azide, 10 6M phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride and 100 pg ml soya bean trypsin inhibitor containing 15 sucrose in a tissue to buffer ratio of l 10 w v . The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 minutes in 8 one liter capacity swing out buckets at 1000 rpm Sorvall, Newton, Conn. . The supernate was recentrifuged at 7,000 x g for 45 minutes. The yield was 100 grams of protein.The 7 000 x g supernate was concentrated 8 fold by an Amicon DC 10 unit equipped with Hl 50 hollow fiber cartridge Amicon,Lexington, Mass. suspended in an equal volume of theTris HCl buffer, reconcentrated to the original volume to reduce sucrose concentration and stored in 200 ml aliquots at 600C. All temperature values herein are centigrade unless stated otherwise. The yield at this stage was 77 grams of protein. This concentrate can be diluted with buffer and reconcentrated. Next, the above obtained concentrated supernate was fractionated by a linear sucrose density gradient centrifugation. This was accomplished by preparative fractionation of aliquots of 200 ml each 20 g protein of the concentrated 7,000 x g supernate in aBeckman Model L2 65B refrigerated ultracentrifuge, using a 1.6 liter capacity rotor Ti 50 . A linear sucrose gradient from 35 to 10 was prepared by the aid of a Beckman gradient pump Model No. 141 . The sample was layered on top of the sucrose gradient, the rotor was accelerated to 30,000 rpm and the centrifugation was continued for two hours. The rotor was then decelerated to maintain 3,500 rpm. The sucrose density gradient was eluted by displacement with a 40 sucrose solution and 20 ml fractions were collected every 0.5 minute. Fractions were analyzed for specific binding by 125I hCG.Two fractions eluted between 18 to 28 sucrose contained nearly all of the active receptor. Sucrose concentration was measured by refractive index. The obtained fractions totaled 6.2 gprotein. Thereafter, the two fractions were separately concentrated by an Amicon DC 2 unit equipped with aHI 50 cartridge. Then, the samples were diluted with the Tris HCl buffer and re concentrated in the same apparatus. Finally, this phase of the purification process was completed by centrifuging at 55,000 rpm for 4 hours to sediment the receptor protein. Percent recoveries for the two fractions were 60 and 92 , respectively. The sediments are combined at this point. The 10mM Tris HCl buffer, containing 0.5 Triton X 100 was added to the receptor fraction 25 mg protein per ml . 1 Triton X 100 solubilized more protein but significantly reduced hormone binding activity, perhaps due to formation of Triton X 100 micelles.The suspension was sonicated at 50 watts, four times for 5 second duration each time at 40C to increase receptor protein solubilization and recovery of hormone binding activity. The neutral lipids were extracted by shaking with an equal volume of chilled petroleum ether at 40C for one hr and finally centrifuging at 10,000 rpm for one hr. The organic solvent, the aqueous phase, and the insoluble residue were separated. The aqueous phase contained the solubilized receptor. The aqueous layer was recentrifuged at 5,000 rpm and 943 mg of protein recovered. This product was purified by gel filtration on a column of Sepharose6B. The column was eluted with the Tris Hcl buffer, containing 0.52 Triton X 100 at a flow rate of 13.5 ml per hour. Six ml fractions were collected and tested for receptor using 125I hCG, the fractions having significant receptor activity being pooled and then fractionated on multiple 2.8 x 35 cm columns ofSepharose 4B. It was found that the ascending chromatography on Sepharose 6B separated a large amount of the adenylate cyclase activity retarded protein fraction from the hormone binding activity unretarded protein fraction .The sample at this point contained 22 mg protein per 15 ml of theTris HCl buffer. Column elution was carried out using the Tris HCl buffer containing 0.5 Triton X 100 at a flow rate of 8 ml per hour. 4 ml fractions were collected. In essence, the fraction obtained from theSepharose 6B column was sub divided into two fractions by the Sepharose 4B columns, one fraction containing most of the hormone binding activity unretarded protein fraction and the other fraction containing most of the 5 nucleotidase activity retarded fraction . Again, through testing by specific binding to 125I hCG, the active fractions were pooled. The active fractions from four Sepharose 4B columns were concentrated 5 fold by an Amicon ultrafilter and gel filtered through a 5 x 50 cm column of UltrogelACA 34 LKB Instruments . The Ultrogel ACA 34 column was eluted with 0.3M lithium borate buffer lmM MgCl2, 0.01 NaN3 and 0.5 Triton pH 7.2 at a flow rate of 10ml hr. 4 ml fractions were collected. The Ultrogel ACA 34 significantly reduced the Triton X 100 concentration, ex.from about 0.5 to about 0.2 . At this point, the sample consisted of 73.5 mg of protein in the lithium borate buffer. Vertical zone electrophoresis was carried out on a 3 x 42 cm column of cellulose. The cellulose powder was equilibrated in the lithium borate buffer, decanted and then packed into the column. The column was washed extensively with the same buffer prior to electrophoresis. The receptor protein was equilibrated in the. same buffer by dialysis. The conditions of electrophoresis were 60 80mA, 300 315 volts, 72 hours duration. In another procedure, a constant voltage of 300 volts and 60mA for 5 hours at 40C was used. The column was eluted with the lithium borate buffer. Fractions containing the receptor were concentrated by ultrafiltration and chromatographed on Ultrogel ACA 34 columns in the lithium borate buffer to remove excess Triton and to concentrate into a smaller volume.At this stage, the purified product weighed 6.52 mg. The binding capacity of the original 7,000 x g supernate, the first Ultrogel fraction and the product at this stage were 5.15, 310 and 2,681 pMhCG mg protein affinity constant Kd of 0.76 x 10 10 liter M1 , respec tively, which represents approximately an 11,805 fold purification of the protein in the 7,000 x g supernate and a final 536 fold increase in receptor binding capacity. A further purification step was carried out by immunoaffinity column chromatography on hCG bound anti hCG Sepharose 4B matrix. The receptor specific activity as compared to the zone electrophoresis product increased only by 1.05 fold. Molecular weight of the electrophoretically pure receptor glyco protein was found to be about 5.9 million using gel permeation chromatography, as described more fully hereinafter. Purification has advanced to the degree that analysis of the receptor material by disc gel electrophoresis following treatment hereinafter disclosed yielded a single glycoprotein band, of about 240 thousand molecular weight. All molecular weights, amino acid analyses and carbohydrate analyses of the receptor protein and components thereof disclosed herein are understood to be within the normally accepted error of 10 of the value disclosed Various protein markers were used to estimate the aggregate molecular weight as well as the molecular weights of the various aggregate sub units disclosed hereinafter.Accordingly, one embodiment of this invention involves the discovery of an electrophoretically homogeneous hLH hCG receptor glycoprotein of about 5.9 million molecular weight composed of a plurality of glyco polypeptide components, probably linked to one another through di sulfide bonds to form said glycoprotein aggregate, said glycoprotein aggregate component appearing as a single glycoprotein band as determined by disc gel electrophoresis. Although it is believed that the isolated receptor could be obtained from the corpus luteum of various species of animals having the common receptor for hLH and hCG, as well as from other receptor sources such as those disclosed hereinbefore and also could be synthetically produced following further structural analyses such as amino acid sequence the present inventors obtain it from bovine corpora lutea.Thus, a more specific embodiment of this aspect of the invention involves a detergent solubilizable, electrophoretically pure, hCG hLH receptor glycoprotein of bovine corpora lutea, as above defined, and having a specific binding capacity of at least 2000 pM hCG mg protein, preferably at least 2500 pM hCG mg protein.Binding capacity was performed by equilibration of the protein sample with approximately 50,000 cpm equivalent to 1.25 ng of 125I hCG, in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled hCG from 0.25 to 20,000 ng. Conventional incubation procedures were used, with the addition of an equal volume of 20 w v polyethylene glycol 6,000, dissolved in phosphate buffered saline, to the incubate to precipitate the hormone receptor complex. Thereafter, the tubes were shaken, centrifuged and the supernate aspirated. Sediments were resuspended in buffer, again mixed with the polyethylene glycol and recentrifuged. Radioactivity of the pellet, representing 125I hCG receptor complex was determined. Specific binding and affinity constants were calculated according to the method of Scatchard, G, Ann. N.Y. Acad.Sci., 51, 660 1949 . Disc gel electrophoresis was carried out using sodium dodecyl sulfate hereinafter SDS polyacylamide gel disc electrophoresis as follows The purified hLH hCG receptor fraction was analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis, according to the method of King and Laemmli, J. Mol. Biol., 62, 465 1971 with minor modifications, to yield an optimum resolution of protein components. Aliquots of 30 60 pg of purified fractions of the hLH hCG receptor were solubilized in 0.52 Triton X 100, lyophilized and dissolved in 100 p1 of water. Samples were then dialyzed for 48 hours against 0.125M Tris HCl buffer of pH 8.0, containing lmM EDTA. Samples were heated in boiling water in the presence of 2 SDS alone or 2 SDS and 1 mercaptoethanol M.E. , for 1 1 2 minutes. Protein markers of known molecular weights dissolved in Tris HCl buffer and treated with 2 SDS and 1 M.E. were applied on the stacking gel and electrophoresed simultaneously.The electrophoreses were performed in 0.025 M Trisglycine buffer containing 0.1 SDS, pH 8.3. After the electrophoreses, the gels were removed from the glass columns and the protein bands were stained withCoomassie Blue. The relative mobilities ref of the protein markers and of the purified receptor fractions were calculated, and a relationship was established between the Rf and logarithm of molecular weight of each marker protein, to calculate the molecular weights, of the purified receptor samples. The 5.9 million aggregate sample treated with 2 SDS yielded a single glycoprotein band of approximately 240,000 molecular weight. The sample treated with SDS plus M.E. yielded three bands of approximately 160,000 57,000 and 44,000 molecular weights, suggesting the presence of oligomers, probably disulfide linked. Prior to disc gel electrophoresis, the receptor protein obtained after cellulose zone electrophoresis was subjected to gel permeation chromatography on a column of Sepharose 4B to determine molecular weight.After gel filtration, the unretarded fraction of receptor protein is the 5.9 million molecular aggregate, as above disclosed. The column was eluted with lOmM Tris HCl buffer containing lmN MgCl2, 0.0170 NaN3 and 0.5 Triton X 100. Further experimentation was carried out to determine the components or units forming the 5.9 million aggregate. In each case, the molecular weight estimate was determined using gel permeation chromatography as described below. Attempts were made to deaggregate the 5.9 million molecular weight protein into its largest polypeptide units. Gel permeation chromatography of the receptor glycoprotein was carried out before and after the various treatments described below. A protein concentration of approximately 1 mg ml was used for each treatment. In each case, the gel columns were equilibrated and eluted with appropriate solvents containing 0.5 Triton X 100. Standards of known molecular weight DNA supercoiled blue dextran, thyroglobulin, ferritin, aldolase and catalase were gel filtered through the columns and gels selected to resolve the approximate range of the molecular sizes of a protein marker. The Kav index of solute migration in gel chromatography for each marker and for each receptor component was calculated from its elution volume.The molecular weights of the receptor components were determined from a standard curve of Kav versus the molecular weights of the known protein markers. Treatment with 1M NaCl overnight at 40 as well as with 2 SDS and 1 mercaptoethanol at 40 did not alter the molecular weight of the receptor protein aggregate. However, treatment with 2 SDS, at 1000 for 1 1 2 min, deaggregated the 5.9 million molecular weight material into a plurality of a 280,000 molecular weight species, which was separated on aSepharose 6B column, of the hormone free hLH hCG receptor. The Sepharose 6B column was eluted with 0.1M acetic acid containing lmM MgC12, 0.01 NaN3, 0.1 SDS and 0.5 Triton X 100.When the 280,000 molecular weight species was incubated with 1251 hCG, and, applied to a Sepharose 6B column, a major hormone bound component with a molecular weight of 185,000 was recovered by elution with 10mM Tris HCl buffer containing lmM MgC12, O.01 NaN3 and 0.5 Triton X l00. If a molecular weight of 40,000 is subtracted for hCG from the 185,000 molecular weight species, the resulting molecular weight of 145,000 suggests the presence of a dimer of the receptor of approximately 280,000 molecular weight. That is, the 280,000 species disassociates into two oligomers of approximately 145,000 molecular weight each.Both the binding of 125I hCG or covalent linking of 125I hCG alone cause the reduction of the 280,000 molecular weight dimer, and the appearance of the hormone bound 185,000 molecular weight forms of the receptor. In another set of experiments, the 280,000 molecular weight component following treatment for 1 1 2 min at 1000 with 2 SDS and l.5mM DTT dithiothreitol followed by gel filtration on a column of Ultrogel ACA 34, yielded a 120,000 molecular weight species of the hLH hCG receptor by elution with a 0.01 M Tris HCl buffer containing lmM Mac12, 0.01 NaN3, 0.01 SDS, 2mM DTT and 0.5 Triton X 100. Further treatment of the 120,000 species with 50 mM DTT for 1 1 2 min at 1000, and gel filtration on Ultrogel ACA 34 in the above 0.01 MTris MCl buffer yielded two oligomers of the molecular weights 85,000 and 38,000.Each of these compo nents bound 125I hCG specifically and eluted fromUltrogel ACA 34 by IOmM Tris HCl buffer containing lmM MgC12, 0.01 NaN3 and 0.5 Triton X 100 as hormone bound complexes of molecular weights of 125,000 and 92,000, respectively. In another experiment, 125I hCG was cÏupled covalently to the 5.9 million molecular weight aggregate, which was then dissociated into hormone bound 185,000 molecular weight species, by treatment with 2 SDS, for 1 1 2 min, at 1000. A 3000 rpm supernate thereof was applied to a column of Sepharose 6B and in addition the sediment was redissolved in 10mM Tris HCl buffer containing 0.5 Triton X 100 and then treated with 2 SDS for 1 1 2 minutes at 1000C followed.by gel filtration on the same type column. In both instances, the 185,000 molecular weight species was obtained by elution with 10mM Tris HCl buffer containing lmM MgCl2, 0.01 NaN, 0.1 SDS and 0.5 Triton X 100. Treatment of the 125I hCG coupled species with 50 mM DTT for 1 1 2 min at 1000 also yielded 1251 hCG coupled oligomers of the molecular weights of 110,000 and 74,000 corresponding to 70,000 and 34,000 molecular weight units after subtracting 40,000 for hCG Treatment of the 85,000 and 38,000 molecular weight units with up to 150 mM DTT in the presence of 2 SDS for 1 1 2 min at 1000, did not dissociate these units further into smaller molecular weight components.Hence, it is expected that the 70,000 to 85,000 and the 34,000 to 38,000 molecular weight species are probably the disulfide linked subunits of the 120,000 to 145,000 molecular weight component and may be the smallest intact polypeptide units which carry out the specific binding with hCG and hLH. From the above experiments and discussion, the two lowest molecular weight units known at this time of the naturally occurring receptor may be defined with respect to their freedom from hormone units, their molecular weight ranges of about 34,000 to 38,000 and about 70,000 to 85,000, respectively, their specific binding capability for hCG and their stability under the various conditions of treatment heretofore described. In turn, these basic units appear to be linked through covalent disulfide bonds into repeating units of about 120,000 to 145,000 molecular weight. At the present time, it is believed that one each of the two types of basic units join to form the 120,000 to 145,000 molecular weight unit.Variations in molecular weight determinations are believed due to the limitations of the disc gel electrophoresis and gel chromatography systems, including the number of different standard protein markers employed. However, the important determinations are that two different molecular weight subunits, each having specific hCG binding capability exist which in turn form the basic repeating building blocks of the receptor. The 120,000 to 145,000 molecular weight species is in a sense a repeating monomeric unit, two of which link to form a 240,000 to 280,000 molecular weight oligomer. A plurality of these oligomers are associated with one another to form the 5.9 million aggregates. Amino acid and carbohydrate analyses were carried out on the electrophoretically pure receptor product and on some of the partially purified intermediate receptor products. Amino acid analysis was carried out by dialyzing 100 jjg aliquots of receptor overnight against water1 drying in vacuo and hydrolyzing with 100 p1 of 5.7N HC1 at 1100 for 24 h. The hydrolysate was dried again in vacuo to remove any residual acid.The sample was dissolved in citrate buffer, and analyzed for amino acids on an automatic amino acid analyzer Durrum, Model D 500 . The neutral sugar content of the hLH hCG receptor was determined by methanolysis of the sugars, trimethysilylation and gas liquid chromatography. The hexosamine content was determined on the amino acid analyzer after a 4 hour hydrolysis of the sample with 5.7 N HC1. The sialic acid content of the purified receptor was determined by the thiobarbituric acid method. The major amino acids found in the electrophoretically pure receptor are aspartic acid and glutamic acid. On a percentage basis, there is somewhat less of each in comparison with a sample purified by the sequential method of Example 1 but substituting affinity chromatography for zone electrophoresis. The carbohydrate content of the electrophoretically pure receptor is approximately 10 . See Table 1 setting forth amino acid and carbohydrate analysis of three receptor materials. The number of each type of amino acid residue in the glycoprotein aggregate can be calculated from Table 1. The electrophoretically pure glycoprotein receptor aggregate acts as an antigen when administered to test animals, such as rabbits, for production of antiserum. It is believed that the various glycoprotein subunits of the aggregate, as disclosed hereinbefore, would also elicit antigenic response in test animals.

A. Preparation of hormone enzyme complex Two mg of hLH were dissolved in 200 p1 of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer of pH 7.5 containing 0.1 M NaCl and reacted with 200 pl of 20mM N succinimidyl 3,2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP in ethanol for 30 min at room temperature in a shaker. The excess SPDP was removed by gel filtration on a 1 x 20 cm column of Sephadex G 25 fine in 0.01 M ammonium bicarbonate buffer of pH8.4. The column was eluted at the rate of 8.4 ml hour in a refrigerated fraction collector via a Uvicord recorder.Each fraction was analyzed by standard radioimmunoassay to locate the hLH activity. 0.5 mg protein of the lyophilized fraction containing the 2 pyridyl disulfide hLH was reacted in a glass vial with 0.25 mg protein equivalent of thiolated alkaline phosphatase i.e. 2.5 pM in 50 pal for 24 h at room temperature with shaking.The incubate was applied to a 0.5 x 28 cm column ofUltrogel ACA 34 equilibrated and eluted with 0.01 M ammonium bicarbonate buffer of pH 8.4. Suitable aliquots of the fractions eluted from the column were analyzed by radioimmunoassay of hLH and examined for optical density at 420 nM in a Beckman spectrophotometer to locate hLH alkaline phosphatase conjugate as well as unconjugated alkaline phosphatase and hIll. The fraction containing hLH alkaline phosphatase conjugate was stored in suitable aliquots at 200C until use. B. Preparation of inert support having antiLH y globulin or purified receptor covalently coupled thereto Solid glass beads of 6 mm diameter were sandblasted with 60 grit particles at a pressure of 75 lb sq inch for 10 min. A 0.001 solution of anti hlH y globulin 1.4 pg bead and a 0.0035 aqueous solution of purified hl31 receptor protein of Example 1 5 pg bead were used in the reaction. A batch of 200 g of the sandblasted beads approximately 700 beads was heated in 200 ml of 10 y aminopropyl triethoxysilane in toluene for 4 h at 700C in a Dubanoff metabolic shaker to generate alkylamino groups. The reagents were decanted and the beads were washed three times with 200 ml aliquots of toluene, air dried, and incubated with 100 ml of 1.25 glutaraldehyde in 0.01 M sodium phosphate buffer of pH 7.0 for 1 h at room temperature.The glutaraldehyde activated beads were washed 5 6 times with 100 ml aliquots of 0.01 M sodium phosphate buffer of pH 7.0. The antiLH y globulin was covalently coupled to glass beads as described by Post et al, supra. Similarly, the hIll receptor, in 0.01 M Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.5 Triton X 100, was coupled to the glass beads. After the coupling reaction, the beads were washed with chilled 0.01 M sodium phosphate buffer to remove unreacted antibody or receptor. The beads were then incubated for 2 h at 40C with gentle shaking with 100 ml of 1 M glycine solution in 0.01 sodium phosphate of pH 7.0 in order to block free alkylamino groups. The anti hLH y globulin or hIll receptor coupled beads were stored in air tight containers at 200C until use. C. The actual assay procedure can be carried out in a conventional manner, for example using the following procedure to quantitatively determine hLH level. Into two sets of 75 x 100 mm polystyrene assay tubes, each tube of one set containing one antibody coupled glass bead and each tube of the other set containing one receptor coupled glass bead, there was added 1 100 pl of low hLH containing urine collected during the luteal phase and diluted 1 10 with phosphate buffer 0.01 M, pH 7.0 as controls or an unknown urine sample as unknowns, 1 10 dilution 2 100 p1 of hLH standard into the control tubes or sodium phosphate buffer into the unknown tubes and 3 100 pl of LH alkaline phosphatase conjugate equivalent to 150 ng protein tube into all tubes. The urinary hLH standards contained doubling dilutions of hLH from 800 to 6.25 mIU ml. The contents of the tubes were mixed and incubated for 2 h at room temperature on aDubanoff shaker.After incubation the reagents were decanted and the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of 0.9 Nail. One ml of substrate solution 6.3 mM p nitrophenylphosphate Na2, 0.05 M glycine and 0.5 M MgCl2 in 0.1 N NaOH, pH 10.5 was added to each tubeThe reaction was carried out for 30 min at 370C, then 0.5 ml of 1 N NaOH was added to each tube and the absorbance was recorded at 420 nM on a Beckman 2400 spectrophotometer. Standard curves were developed from the controls and the resulting standard curves used to determine the concentrations of hIll in the unknowns. The above illustrates both an enzymeimmunoassay EIA and an enzymereceptorassay ERA of hIll. The detection and analyses of hCG would be carried out in an analogous fashion using analogous reagents. The sensitivity of the test, 11.0 to 12.5 mIU ml, is sufficient to discriminate the midcycle hLH surge 75 to 100 mIU hLH ml of urine from hLH levels during follicular and luteal phases of normal menstrual cycles. Two additional advantages arise through the use of the reagents and test procedure of this example.First, in the ERA, the stability of the purified receptor is increased after coupling to the inert support. Second, the EIA and ERA methods yield higher estimates for hLH than radioimmunoassay methods. This amplification characteristic increases as the level of hLH increases and in this manner the EIA and ERA methods serve as amplifiers to aid in the detection of the hLH surge. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the hormone hLH or hCG used in the assay, i.e., to form the hormone enzyme complex, is purified through use of the purified receptor to remove closely related hormones and subunits. Procedures such as those of Saito et al, supra, incorporated herein by reference, can be employed to accomplish hormone purification. For example, the hormone can be incubated with the receptor previously coupled to a solid phase then the solid phase and supernatant are separated from one another and the hormone is dissociated from the receptor by treatment with a buffer at appropriate pH and temperature, e.g., 0.1 M T ris HCl buffer of pH 10, at 400C for 1 minute, to yield the purified hormone. In the above example 2, the hIll phosphatase conjugate was prepared through a reaction sequenceof first reacting the hLH hormone with SPDP to form an hLH SPDP complex through the N succinimide ester group. Thereafter, the protein bound 2 pyridyl disulphide structure was reduced by the thiolated alkaline phosphatase. Chemically, the resultant molecule is a protein protein complex linked through dithiopropionamide. Carlsson et al, supra, describes these types of chemical reaction sequences in detail. A more preferred method of preparing the hormoneenzyme complex is to first react separately the hormone hLH or hCG in this case and the enzyme non thiolated with SPDP to form a hormone SPDP complex and an enzyme SPDP complex. Thereafter, either the hormone SPDP complex or the enzyme SPDP complex is thiolated, for example by reaction with dithiothreitol in a 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer. Finally, the thiolated reactant is reacted with the non thiolated, i.e., hLH SPDP complex is reacted with thiolated enzyme SPDP complex. Except for the intermediate thiolation step, the reaction conditions can be those of Example 2. In the above Examples, the inert support used in the solid phase assays of this invention has been exemplified by glass beads. Other inert supports known in the art could be employed, such as synthetic and natural polymers, other inorganic based particles and so on, whether in the form of a bead or in other shapes such as a rod or strip, test tube, wafer, etc.Similarly, the hormone enzyme complex has been exemplified with alkaline phosphatase, but other enzymes used in color forming EIA or ERA reactions, such as horseradish peroxidase, glucuronidase, etc.are suitable herein. A refinement and simplification of the present invention, particularly suitable for a qualitative at home ovulation or pregnancy test is to directly link a dye to the hormone. Thus, a hormone dye complex is formed in place of the hormone enzyme complex, using the procedures discussed above for forming the hormone enzyme complex. A specific example of a hormone dye complex is hLH coupled to the fluorescent dye ANS. This eliminates the need for a color forming substrate. In this embodiment of the invention, the hormone dye conjugate will be colored. If the conjugate is displaced from the solid phase by hLH in the unknown sample, the supernatant will become colored. As variations of the invention, the following may be mentioned. For example, in embodiments to be used for carrying out the test procedures in the physician s office or at home, the antibody or receptor can be coupled directly to plastic test tubes, such as polystyrene tubes using procedures known in the art. The antibody or receptor can exist as a coating on a portion of the interior test tube surface. After addition of the hormone enzyme conjugate, incubation and decantation are carried out. The substrate to form a color in the presence of the enzyme can then be added either to the original tube or to the supernatant to determine the presence or absence of ovulation and or pregnancy. Another variation of the invention involves the use of a strip or rod, of plastic or glass, to which the antibody or receptor has been coupled. This solid phase is inserted into a test tube to which the hormone enzyme or hormone dye complex plus the unknown are added. Standard colorforming reactions are employed. Biological fluids other than urine can be employed in the test procedures. For example, various blood fractions known to contain hLH and or hCG can be used. In the at home test embodiments, a convenient fluid to use is the saliva or urine. As is understood in the art, standards and or positive and or negative controls will be run sideby side with the unknown for comparison purposes. Variations of the invention will be apparent to the skilled artisan.
