# Wire rope to chain connector to anchoring systems.

## Abstract
An improved connector for coupling a chain to a wire rope or cable such that the resulting connection can be passed over a sheave, pulley, wheel or windlass without applying a bending stress to the wire rope. The connector comprises a hemispherical housing having an opening therethrough that is axially symmetric about the radius that is perpendicular to the planar portion of the hemispherical housing. The opening is adapted to accept and retain a wire rope having a terminal fitting by holding the terminal fitting within the hemispherical housing. A semi circular member of common radius to the hemispherical housing and adapted to accept and retain a chain is attached to the planar portion of the hemispherical housing. A pair of retaining pins pass through the co axial openings in the hemispherical housing and the end of the semi circular member terminating on flat surfaces on opposite sides of the terminal fitting of the wire rope. In this manner the essentially spherical connector is held in an assembled state with the wire rope being rigidly affixed within the connector. Such a connector is useful in eliminating bending stress at the wire rope connector as it passes over a sheave or the like and also allows for smaller and more economical sheaves to be employed.

## Description
WIRE ROPE TO CHAIN CONNECTOR FOR AMCHORING SYSTEMS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to a connector for coupling a chain to a wire rope. More specifically, this invention relates to an improved connector that allows an anchor chain to wire connection to pass over a wheel, sheave, or windlass without excessive stress being applied to the wire rope. 2. Description of the Prior Art With the advent of heavy special purpose vessels, particularly offshore drilling vessels or other floating structures it has become common practice to use anchoring systems comprising a plurality of relatively long anchor lines each including a heavy anchor chain connected to a wire rope. Typically, systems employ from one to several thousand feet of anchor chain connected to the end of the chain opposite the anchor. In order to handle such anchor lines various methods and apparatus have been suggested and employed with varying degrees of success. Thus, it is generally known to use combination wheels or sheaves having an inner groove dimensioned to accomodate the wire rope, and an outer groove, which may be pocketed, dimensioned to accomodate the chain.In some cases it has been proposed to employ simple link connectors between the anchor chain and the wire rope, but the bending forces in the wire rope at the connection have proved too great for such an arrance ment to be completely satisfactory. Accordingly, many especial connectors have been proposed but many of these have limitations, such as a limit of about 90 change in direction, or even less, while traversing a wheel or sheave, or a requirement that the connection be oriented in a particular manner before it passes over the wheel or sheave. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the disadvantages associated with previously available wire rope and chain connectors, I have discovered improved connector comprising An essentially hemispherical housing having an opening therethrough that is axially symmetric abort the radius that is perpendicular to the planar portion of the hemispherical housing and wherein the opening is adapted to accept and retain a wire rope having a terminal fitting by holding the terminal fitting within the hemispherical housing a substantially semi circular member capable of being pivotally assembled to the planar portion of the essentially hemispherical housing and adapted to accept and retain a chain in the assembled state and a means to maintain the substantially semi circular member and the essentially hemispherical housing in an assembled state. The improved connector of the present invention provides for the semi circular member and the hemispherical housing to be equipped with openings which will be co axial in the assembled state such that retaining pins passing through these openings will maintain the assembled state.The present invention further provides that the terminal fitting on the wire rope is a cylindrical sleeve equipped with a pair of flat surfaces on opposite sides and the pair of retaining pins used to maintain the assembled state by passing through the coaxial openings terminated on these flat surfaces such as to further hold the wire rope within the hemispherical housing. By selecting a common radius for both the semi circular member and the hemispherical housing an essentially spherical connector results. The present invention also provides for an improved sheave that has an essentially semi circular cross sectioned outer groove to accept the spherical connector and an inner groove tangential to the bottom of the outer groove to accept the chain and wire rope. The invention will now be described further, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a partial cross sectional top view of a preferred embodiment of the wire rope to chain connector according to the present invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The improved wire rope to chain connector of the present invention, how it functions, and its advantages over the prior art can perhaps be best explained and understood by reference to the accompany drawings. FIGURE 1 and 2 illustrate a partial cross sectional top view and a partial cut away side view of a preferred embodiment of the connector generally indicated by the numeral 10, while coupled to chain 12 at one end and wire rope 14 at the other end. Connector 10 is made up of an essentially hemispherical housing 16 having an opening 18. This opening 18 passes through the housing along and axially symmetric about the radius of the hemisphere that is perpendicular to the planar side of the hemisphere.In other words, the opening 18 is positioned such that it passes through the center of the hemispherical housing 16 and exits at the top or apex of the hemispherical surface. In this manner and by virtue of the rotational symmetry of the opening about this particular radius, the approach of the connector 10 to a sheave will not require any pre orientation or alignment in that all angles of rotation about the wire rope are equivalent. Housing 16 is further provided with a semi circular member 20 which attaches to the planar or flat side of the hemispherical housing 16. The semi circular member 20 is adapted to thread through the end link of chain 12 and thus retain chain 12 to connector 10. As illustrated in FIGURES 1 and 2 opening, 18 is smoothly contoured on the exterior, narrowing down to a circular cross section large enough to accept the wire rope 18 and then expands to a cylindrically cavity 22 on the interior of the housing 16. A terminal or end fitting 24 is provided to insert into the cavity 22. The end flitting 24 is provided with a conical interior cavity to accept the wire rope 14. The end to the wire rope 14 within the conical interior of the fitting 24, is unraveled and held rigidly in place by a filler material 25 See FIGURES 3 and 4 .In this manner, the end fitting 24 will prevent the wire rope 14 from exiting the connector 10. End fitting 24 is further provided with a pair of flat surfaces 26 and 28 at the far end on opposite sides such that retaining pins 30 and 32 will engage the surfaces and prevent the end fitting 24 and wire rope 14 from swiveling relative to housing 16 as well as preventing then from exiting the flat side of the hemispherical housing 16. Retaining pin 30 and 32 also pass through the co axially aligned openings in the end of the semi circular member 20 and openings in the hemispherical housing 16 thus forming a means to retain the connector in an assembled state. Two small tightly fitting pins or rivets 34 and 36 are used to secure the retaining pins in place. To assemble the connector illustrated in FIGURES 1 through 4, the wire rope is first threaded through opening 18 and allowed to extend beyond the backside of the hemispherical housing 16. The end of the wire rope is then threaded through the smaller opening of the terminal fitting 24 and allowed to extend out the other side. The indlvidual strands of the wire rope are then unraveled to enlarge the size of the end of the wire rope and subsequently the unraveled part is pulled back within the conical cavity of the end fitting 24. At this point the voids surrounding the bundle of loose ends are filled with a liquid filler such as molten metal or plastic resin and the filler is allowed to set up. The protruding loose ends of wire are then trimmed off of the far end of the terminal fitting 24 and the fitting is pulled back into the cylindri cally cavity 22. The semi clrcular member 20 is then threaded through the end link of chain 12 and the openings in the ends of the member 20 are aligned with the opening in the housing 16 as retaining pins 30 and 32 are inserted.The wire rope end fittings 24 is then swiveled within the cavity 22 such that the flat surfaces engage the tips of pins 30 and 32. The small pins 34 and 36 are then hammered into place completing the assembly. In operation See FIGURES 5 through 8 the essentially hemispherical exterior surface of the housing 16 is sized to engage and rest on the outer peripheral portion of the sheave 40 over which the chain, connector, and wire rope are to traverse. While the connection engages or rests on the essentially semi circular cross sectioned outer groove 42 See FIGURE 9 the chain 12 and wire rope 14 superimposed will travel on an inner smaller groove 44 of the same sheave located essentially tangential of the bottom of the lowest portion of the outer groove 42.Because the inner and outer grooves of the sheave are similar in diameter, the lever arm induced variation in tension experienced by the wire rope as the chain, connector, and wire rope combination passes over the sheave is significantly less than that experienced in the prior art type connectors as illustrated in FIGURES 5 through 8 and FIGURE 9. As seen in FIGURE 5 as the connector 10 approaches and just touches the outer groove 42 of the sheave 40 Position 1 the stress associated with the illustrated approximately 450 deviation from straight vertical at the sheave is a constant At fixed load . But as the connector passes over the sheave the change in effective lever arm associated with the inherent change in diameter between the inner groove and outer groove results in a rise in stress to a maximum value FIGURE 6, positioned 2 .As connector 10 continues around the outer groove the stress again equilibrates and then goes through a minimum See FIGURES 7, position 3 value. As the connector leaves the sheave and the chain remains in the inner aroove, the stress returns At fixed load to the value characteristic of that of when the wire rope was in the inner groove FIGURE 8, positionly . FIGURE 10 illustrates the cyclic nature of the stress experienced when the connector passes over the sheave. Because of the relative small difference in diameters between the inner and outer groove Smaller lever arm change the range of stress is significantly less than that associated with the prior art connectors and sheaves.Since wire rope fatigue is more of a function of the variation in stress experienced than a function of the magnitude of the stress, the longevity and life expectancy of a wire rope in the present invention will be correspondingly longer than the respective prior art methods. The reason that the present connector can be employed with a smaller sheave having sn inner and outer groove much closer in diameter to each other is related to the compactness of the present connector. By incorporating the wire rope end fitting within the hemispherical housing the entire connector is essentially a sphere.Not only does this allow for close proximity of the inner and outer qrooves but also the placing of the wire end fitting within the spherical structure virtually eliminates the inducing of bending tension in the wire rope at the end fitting when the connector passes over the sheave. Ry alleviating the necessity of havinq a significant difference in radius between the inner and outer arooves, the sheave can be designed much smaller and more compact at a significant savings in capital investment. By virtue of preserving essentially the entire other half of the compact sphere as a means for a creating rotationel freedom i.e., the pivotaLly attached semi circular member and chain a broad ranqe of angular motion can be achieved as the connector traverses the sheave. If extremely large angles are required between the direction the chain or wire rope approaches or exits the sheave, a plurality of connectors in series can be easily employed to distribute the peri spherical entrance and exit points at a areater distance apart on the outer circumference of the sheave. Although the preferred embodiment illustrated herein is not easily disassembled, the selection of method of retaining the semi circular member can be easily modlfied by using any of the techniques or removable fasteners well known in the art, thus producing a connector that is readily disassemblable. Conveniently, the wire rope can be disassembled by the well known methods of using molten zinc or the like. However, the use of a thermo settlng resin is preferred since such techniques lead to more compact end fittinqs. In such a case, the wire rope is replaced by removing the pins from the housing and pushlng the wire rope through the housing such as to cut off the end fitting. Also, various geometric shapes other than the cylindrical end flitting can be employed including but not limited to a frusto conical fitting, square or rectangular fitting and the like.
