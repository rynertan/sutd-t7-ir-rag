# Internally cooled flexible exhaust valve.

## Abstract
A flexible exhaust valve capable of conforming to a valve seat slightly out of round is disclosed. This valve, which includes internal cooling, will produce an excellent exhaust seal when used in combination with an exhaust valve seat that is machined round within about .001 inches. The improved seal is expected to reduce emissions of unburned hydrocarbon and improve engine life.
