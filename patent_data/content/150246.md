## Description
AVERAGING METHOD FOR ELIMINATION OF PERIODIC STRAYS AND A CIRCUIT ARRANGEMENT FOR APPLYING THE METHODThe present invention relates to an averaging method for elimination of periodic strays, e.g. strays of mains origin, and a circuit arrangement in a set up measuring evoked responses for applying the method.The averaging method for elimination of periodic strays, e.g. of mains origin, is suitable for use in analogdigital computers employing an averaging procedure. The averaging procedure elicits evoked responses from a set of signals U recorded from an examined subject. The set of signals U comprises internal noise UsZW zs individual evoked responses U from the examined sub ow ject and periodic strays U induced in this subject zp from an environment comprising a source of the mentioned strays, the specified components of the set of signals being independent.The above statements on the set of signals Uzs can be presented by the following formula U Uszw Uow Uzp. The set of signals U does not com zp prise the component of apparatus noise sza resulting from the operation of the apparatus which picks up and amplifies the set of signals Uzs, because the apparatus internal noise should be so small as to be neglected within the set of signals Uzs during its continuous monitoring e.g. when observing this set on a monitor screen of an averaging computer. This noise can be recognised as the characteristic white noise, which due to its properties is non synchronous with the aforementioned signals Uzs. zsThe mathematical basis of the averaging procedure has been described in a publication by J.S. Bendat Mathematical Analysis of Average Response Values for Nonstationary Data , IEEE Transactions on Bio MedicalEngineering, ME 11 72 81, 1964, and its technicalclinical realization has been described by J. Koped Polish Computer ANOPS for Medical Research and itsClinical Application , Acta Physiologica Polonica, 21 113 123, 1970. Hitherto both the internal noise U of the examined szw subject and the periodic strays U were considered to zp be non synchronous signals in relation to the individual evoked responses U and the averaging procedure could ow be described by the following formula EMI2.1 where n 1,2,3,...,N N at least several hundred.As an example of the above mentioned situation, with 256 sweeps of the averaging procedure, the square root of N equals sixteen, and with maximum amplitudes of the internal noise Uszw and of the periodic strays Uzp equal to 64 AV then their reduction as a result of the averaging procedure is sixteen fold, thus their maximum averaged amplitudes U and U are not greater szw zp than 4 ssV. According to the above, the said averaging procedure, from the practical viewpoint, efficiently reduces the noise and the strays when the ratio of the maximum amplitudes of the said noise and strays to the least significant amplitudes of the said individual evoked responses is less than 20 1 and the reduction is proportional to the square root of the number of sweeps of the averaging procedure provided that the noise and strays are non synchronous in relation to the individual evoked responses.In unfavourable measuring conditions, even if the requirements regarding the said ratio are fulfilled, am plitudes of the periodic strays U may become compar zp able with amplitudes of the individual evoked responses U and the said strays may become synchronous in re ow lation to the individual evoked responses UOW, so that the averaged but nevertheless significant periodic strays U can be superimposed on the averaged evoked zp response Vow. The superimposed signal may distort the ow averaged response to such an extent that its waveform is difficult to interpret.The above described situation can be described by the following formula EMI3.1 where n l,2,3,...,N N at least several hundred. As an example of the above described situation, with 256 sweeps of the averaging procedure, the square root of N equals sixteen and where the maximum amplitudes of the internal noise U and of periodic strays U are szw zp equal to 64 ACV then the sixteen fold reduction in the averaging procedure is effective only in respect of the averaged internal noise U resulting in its ampli szw tude not exceeding 4 AV, while the averaged periodic strays U behave as the averaged evoked response zp Uow are not reduced, and remain equal to 64 AV. In such a case, other known means for reduction of noise and various strays are commonly used, i.e. analog and or digital filtering means.The known filter circuits may be divided into low pass filters eliminating strays and higher frequency signals, high pass filters eliminating strays and lower frequency signals and band stop filters eliminating strays and signals of frequency equal to strays frequency. Each kind of the abovementioned filters interfers with and distorts the ori ginal waveform of the signals U . Interference and zs distortions introduced by the said filters cause elimination not only of strays but also signals of component frequencies comprised in the evoked responses, as the said responses usually comprise signals of frequencies comparable to the fundamental frequency of the strays.The evoked response measuring set ups, known to us, described and manufactured by such companies as NICOLET BIOMEDICAL CO. USA, MEDELEC LIMITED Great Britain,DISA ELEKTRONIK A S Denmark, TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF WARSA Poland are only able to eliminate periodic strays by means of the said averaging procedure, and in the case where the periodic strays Uzp and the individual evoked responses Uow are synchronous, can be supported by the said known filtering circuits. An object of the invention is to provide a method and a circuit arrangement for substantially eliminating periodic strays in an averaging procedure while the original desired waveform is substantially undistorted.According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided an averaging method for elimination of periodic strays in analog digital computers employing an averaging procedure, in which method a set of signals U picked up by electrodes from an examined subject responding to external stimuli elicits an averaged evoked res ponse UOW characterised in that periodic strays U ow zp are eliminated from the set of signals Uzs during the averaging procedure in proportion to the number N of sweeps of the averaging procedure resulting in their at least N fold reduction by introducing a phase shift by an angle in the range 120At o 2400 related to the cycles of the strays U zp such that cycles of the external stimuli and initial phases of the periodic strays at the beginning of two successive periods of the external stimuli, or alternately at the beginning of two successive sweeps of the averaging procedure, have a phase difference of g. According to another aspect of the invention, there is. provided a timing circuit for an evoked response measuring set up for applying an averaging method for strays elimination comprising a triggering circuit delivering common pulses which trigger successive sweeps of the averaging procedure in an averaging computer and simultaneously trigger external stimuli in transducers controlled by a stimulator characterised in that the triggering circuit is connected to a quartz oscillator circuit and through a direct connection to a dividing circuit and is driven by high stability pulses of frequencyP times less than the frequency of pulses supplied by the quartz oscillator circuit. Construction of a timing circuit for the evoked response measuring set up is one aspect of the invention. The circuit employing the averaging method for elimination of the periodic strays prevents the said measuring setup from interfering with and distorting the original analog waveforms of the individual evoked responses UOW from the examined subject, and causes periodic strays U to be unambiguously eliminated from the averaged zp evoked responses Uow in proportion to the number N of sweeps and thus the reduction is at least N fold which means that the above mentioned formula describing the averaged set of signals U during the averaging pro zs cedure is as follows EMI6.1 where n 1,2,3,...,N N at least several hundred.As an example of the above situation, with 256 sweeps of the averaging procedure, the square root of N equals sixteen and the maximum amplitudes of the internal noise szw and the periodic strays Uzp are equal to 64 XV, then the sixteen fold reduction in the averaging procedure is effective only in respect of the averaged inter nal noise U resulting in it having maximum averaged szw amplitudes not greater than 4 AtV, while the averaged periodic strays Uzp are reduced at least 256 fold leaving components with amplitudes not greater than 0.25 AV in the set of the averaged signals and in an ideal case, when the periodic strays Uzp and the individual evoked responses Uow are non synchronous and number of N sweeps approaches infinity, the reduction value also approaches infinity and thus components of the averaged periodic strays U approach zero. zpThe aim of the invention has been achieved by developing an averaging method based on elimination of the periodic strays U from the set of signals U during the zp zs averaging procedure to a greater extent, i.e. in proportion to the number N of sweeps of the averaging procedure, thus resulting in their at least N fold reduction by introducing a phase shift by an angle in the range 120 alpha 240C related to the strays Uzp, which control periods of the external stimuli and initial phases of the periodic strays at the beginning of two successive periods of the external stimuli or alternately at the beginning of two successive sweeps of the averaging procedure differ by the value of the introduced phase shift i.e. by alpha while the phase shift by alpha secures permanent desynchronization between the external stimuli frequen cv and the frequency of the periodic stravs as shown t in Figure 2 and is determined from T const Kt 1 3tmax where K is a natural integer comprised within 0 K tn 5 t N f the duction can be also achieved by introducing permanent desynchronization between external stimuli frequency 1 T, and the fre uency of the er odic strays II as zp shown in Figure 3 and is determined by T const K t 2t , where the K is a natural integer within the min e K range 0 K tn 3 tn 6 tn, and the permaanent desynchronization between the external stimuli frequency , and the frequency t of the periodic strays Uzp is T chosen in such way that the period T is a multiple of the period t of the periodic strays U i.e. K tn Atn in1 zp creased by tn n, 2 tn K , which two last together correspond to the phase shift or at the same time permanent desynchroni zation betweeen the external stimuli frequency 1 T, and the frequency 1 t of the periodic strays Uzp is achieved by introducing the period T being a K multiple of the introdu ing the period T being a K multiple of the period t of the periodic strays Uzp i.e.K tn tn increased by 2 3 tn tn and by a time shift 1 1 3tn 2 tn K 1 2 , which two last together cor respond to the phase shift alpha . A timing circuit for the evoked response measuring set up for applying the aver aging method for periodic strays elimination comprises a triggering circuit which is connected to a quartz oscil lator circuit and by means of a dividing circuit is driven by high stability pulses of frequency P times less than the frequency of pulses supplied by the quartz oscillator circuit, and the frequency of the triggering pulses is computed by dividing the frequency f by a gz divisor P in the dividing circuit, which frequency can be calculated from the formula f t t K gz tn tn K 1 3 for the K derived according to Figure 2, which pulses are fed to the dividing circuit from the quartz oscilla tor circuit or the frequency1, of the triggering pulses T is a result of dividing the frequency f z by a divisorP in the dividing circuit, which frequency may be cal culated from the formula f gz p tn tn K 2 3 . for the K derived according to Figure 3 and pulses of this frequency are fed from the quartz oscillator circuit to the dividing circuit.The above described way of achieving the aim of the invention has the following advantages. Every consecutive external stimulus appearing after time T or T causes every sweep of the averaging procedure to be de layed by the time shift or X respectively, which has the result that the aforementioned strays U compris zp ed in the set of signals Uzs are also shifted in time by or 4 in respect of every individual evoked response U which response is also comprised in the said set of signals Uzs the relevant response is taken from the preceding period T or T in respect to the following period T or T respectively, as is shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 respectively, and in Figures 5 and 6.The aforementioned time shift r or r t secures permanent desynchronization between the periodic strays and the external stimuli, and consequently between the strays and the individual evoked responses Uow and therefore the said strays are effectively eliminated in the averaging procedure in proportion to the number of N sweeps of the averaging procedure, as is illustrated inFigures 5 and 7. This means that amplitudes of the said strays are reduced at least N fold where N is equal to the number of sweeps of the averaging procedure.The substantial advantage of the invented method is that the periods T or T of the external stimuli are in each case certainly non synchronous with the periodic strays Uzp, e.g. of mains origin, thanks to the introduced time shift t or , which shift is dependent on the current frequency of the periodic strays Uzp the frequency 1 t being in the range 1 tmax 1 t 1 P tmin, which parameters and relations are only used for calculating the frequency f or f respectively, whereas gz gz during the averaging procedure of the said set of sig nals U the said parameters of the strays need be zs neither examined nor checked. Application of the averaging method for periodic strays elimination and the timing circuit for the evoked response measuring set up for applying the method is of particular importance for electrophysiological examinations determining the degree of conduction loss of nervous paths between a sense organ and a corresponding reception region of the cortex.Under unfavourable measuring conditions during a reception of e.g. brainstem auditory evoked potentials individual evoked responses UOW , when the averaging procedure elicits from an electroencephalogram internal noise Uszw the aforementioned individual evoked responses picked up from a scalp examined subject activated by acoustic stimuli external stimuli , there is very often met a situation in which the averaging procedure may also elicit remaining components of strays of mains origin together with the individual evoked responses belonging to the set of signals Uzs, so that the strays are in synchronism with sweeps of the averaging procedure. The timing ci rcuit according to the invention prevents in every case the appearance of the said synchronism.For a better understanding of the invention, and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 illustrates relations between angle and time parameters of sinusoidal periodic strays tak ing into consideration frequency tolerance of the said strays Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship of the peri od T of the external stimuli in respect of periods t of the periodic strays taking into consideration a way of achieving frequency de synchronization of the said strays in respect to the said stimuli Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the evoked response measuring set up employing the averaging meth od for periodic strays elimination Figure 5 shows electric signals related to the block diagram of Figure 4 Figure 6 illustrates successive signals of the periodic strays taken to the averaging procedure andFigure 7 illustrates successive sweeps of the averaging procedure.In Figures 6 and 7 the strays signal is shown alone which represents the desynchronized periodic strays in respect to successive pulses, which are triggering successive sweeps of the averaging procedure and triggering the external stimuli which are corresponding to the sweeps and are correlated through the examined subject with the individual evoked responses, which responses and the internal noise are omitted for simplicity of the diagram. The internal noise has also been omitted in Figure 5 for clearance of signals 6A, 6B and 6C representation.The method of periodic strays elimination according to the invention is based on the permanent desynchroniza tion of the frequency 1 t of the said strays in respect to the frequency 1 of pulses which are triggering succes sive sweeps of the averaging procedure after every external stimulus. A triggering pulse originates both external stimulus and a sweep of the averaging procedure.The desynchronization between the frequency t of the said strays and successive sweeps of the averaging procedure is based on the fact that K periods t, 1 3 of period t as in Figure 2 or 2 3 of period t as in Figure 3 and the time shift determine every period T between two successive external stimuli. The said time shift r is in the range 0 max and it corresponds to the phase shift alpha .Because the said strays elimination is to be proportional to the number N of sweeps of the averaging procedure, the phase shift is within the range 120 alpha 240 . The said phase shift concerns the strays e.g. of mains origin, which strays appear in the next sweep of the averaging procedure shifted by oQ as compared with the preceding one. The value 1 T is the temporary value of mains frequency which may be comprised within limits of admissible tolerance determined by national regulations.According to Figure 1 the mains frequency 1 must be comprised within the following limits 1 t because tmin tn tn and tmax tn tn, where Atn expresses the admissible tolerance of the said mains frequency tAn employment of the aforementioned method introduces a fixed value for a single value of K for a given period T of the external stimuli, which period may be described by the following formula as in Figure 2 T const Ktmax 1 3tmmax Ktmin 1 3tmin from which one may find the time shift as 2 tn K 1 3 .The formula determines the time interval, dependent on K and being a difference between a maximum and a minimum period which is a result of the admissible tolerance of the nominal period tn of the periodic strays e.g. of mains origin. From Figure 1, one may conclude that the maximum time shift max corresponding to the phase shift interval 120 alpha 240 represents a difference between respective parts of the admissible maximum and minimum periods of the periodic strays e. g. of mains origin, i. e. max 2 3tmin 1 3tmax 1 3tn From the above it is evident that the time shift n must be within the range 0 1 3tn tn The averaging method of the periodic strays elimination according to the invention allows them to be reduced proportionally to N sweeps of the averaging procedure when the phase shift is within the range 120 alpha 240 . To keep the above correct one needs to calculate K as a number of periods t of the periodic strays comprised in the time interval which is the period T of the external stimuli. The averaging method for the periodic strays elimination requires period T to be equal or greater than it 3 max and the time shift to be less than 1 3tn decreased by tn i. e. T 1 3tmax and 1 3tn tn. Substi tuting Ktmax 1 3tmax for T and 2 tn K 1 3 for in the preceding inequalities, the inequalities become Ktmax 1 3tmax 1 3tmax and 2 tn K 1 3 1 3tn tn. Solving the set of inequalities in respect to K, one finds that K is comprised within the interval 0 0 K tn 5 tn . 6 tn The method of the periodic strays elimination introduces a fixed value of the period T for a given value of K and the K has to be a natural integer i.e. K 0,1,2,3,... . Determining the interval of values of K has been neces sary since if K were greater than tn 5 tn, the phase 6 tn shift would result in angle alpha greater than 2400 and theN fold reduction of the periodic strays would not be maintained.The alternative employment of the aforementioned method for the periodic strays elimination is the introduction of another period T of the external stimuli as is shown in Figure 3. The period T of the external stimuli is described by the following formula as in Figure 3 T const K tmin 2 3tmin K tmax 1 3tmax from which the result is that the time shift is r 1 3tn 2 tn K 1 2 and it simultaneously determines the time interval resulting from the difference between a minimum and a maximum period associated with the ad missible tolerance At of the nominal period t of n n the periodic strays e.g. of mains origin, depending on the value of K used, According to the above T and are modified as compared with T and respectively. TheK, which in this case will be denoted as K , must be also modified. Determining the range of K values the condition must be fulfilled that the period T must be equal or greater than 3tmin while the time shift 1D must be greater than zero i.e. T 2 3 tmin and 0.Substituting K tmin 2 tmin for T and 1 3 tn 2Atn K 1 for in the above inequalities results 2 2 2 in the following K tmin, 2 3 t 2 3t and 9 it 2At K I min 3 min 3 min 3 n n 2 sult is that the K in this case lies within the range 0 K tn 3 tn 6 tn. In this case, the employment of the aforementioned averaging method for periodic strays elimination also introduces a fixed value of the periodT for a given K and the K must be a natural integer i.e. K 0,1,2,3,... .Determining the above range of values of K was also necessary, because if the K in this case were greater than tn 3 tn 6 tn, the phase shift would be of angle alpha less than 12Q and the N fold reduction of the periodic strays would not be maintained.To exemplify the averaging method for periodic strays elimination in Figures 5, 6 and 7 the ideal phase shift of angle alpha 120 is introduced and for better illustration of the periodic strays reduction in Figure 7 twofold magnification of the amplitude scale in relation toFigure 6 is introduced. Besides, the desynchronized sinusoidal strays taken together with the internal noiseUszw and the individual evoked response Uow during each sweep of the averaging procedure are shown in Figures 5 and 6, and they all are repeated in each successive time interval between every two successive external stimuli of frequency T or 1 which time intervals correspond to the sweeps of the averaging procedure.The said sweeps of the averaging procedure are shown in Figure 7, where the waveform A represents the first sweep, the waveform B represents the second sweep and the waveform C represents the third sweep of the averaging procedure and during the third sweep the first complete reduction of the periodic strays takes place and further the waveforms D and E are the results of successive sweeps of the averaging procedure. In the case of phase shift by or 120 , complete reduction of the periodic strays takes place after every third sweep of the averaging procedure, which sweeps are counted starting from the waveform A as the first sweep.Description of the averaging method for periodic strays elimination, in practical cases, requires a detailed discussion which uses some example data, since the said periodic strays may be in particular of mains origin of various values of nominal frequency t depending on the tn place and examination conditions and may be e.g. 50 Hz, 60 Hz, 400 Hz etc.For example, the mains may be a source of the periodic strays in form of a sine wave signal of the nominal frequency t 50 Hz with the admissible tolerance t 1 Hz which means that the period t of the said strays at a given moment of the examination course may be of any value within the tolerance range tmin 19.6 ms 4 t 4 20.4 ms tmax Next a fixed value of the period T of the external stimuli is to be assumed, as an exampleT 100 ms, and next the value is to be corrected in respect to values of T or T being calculated from the aforementioned formulae, and next the correction is to be achieved by determining the value of K or K result ing from the minimum value of the period t of the n strays of mains origin and of the fixed value of Tl. Thus K t 100 ms 5, subject to simultaneous checki us t 20 ms , subject to simuitaneo ing against the condition K tn 5 tn 6 tn 20 ms 5 x 0.4 ms 7.5. The assumed value of K 6 x 0.4 ms 5 determines the correct value of the period T, which in this case is T const Ktmax 1 3tmax 5 x 20.4 ms 1 3 20.4 ms 108.8 ms. The corrected value ofT 108.8 ms i.e. of the time interval between successive external stimuli directly determines the frequency of pulses triggering the sweeps of the averaging procedure, which frequency is 1 9,191176 9.192 Hz.The value is approximated by rounding it up, which makes the frequency T always slightly greater than the minimum required frequency and therefore the above described condition on o that it should be within the aforementioned phase range is always fulfilled. Having determined the frequency of triggering pulses to be 9.192 Hz, the fre quency f of the quartz oscillator circuit is set to gz be of such a value that the condition for angle alpha to be comprised within the aforementioned phase interval is fulfilled. The frequency f is obtained by multiply gz 1 ing a chosen integer P by the frequency T . The chosen integer P should be a multiple of at most the three numbers 2, 3 and 5. such an approach allows for applyingTTL IC s of series 7490, 7492, 7493, Taking P 105 and having the frequency of the triggering pulses T 9.192 Hz, the frequency f is PT 0.9192 MHz. For gz T quartz oscillator circuits a typical tolerance but only of the positive sign may be accepted, as the positive value always increases the nominal frcquency fgz by fgz which makes the period T chortor and the condi tion that alpha be within the above described phase shift range is fulfilled. According to the above, the nominal frequency f of gz the quartz oscillator circuit may be calculated with the formula fgz P tn tn K 1 3 for K of Fig ure 2, or f P for K of Fig ure 3, gz tn tn K 2 3 The above aforementioned averaging method for periodic strays elimination enables design of the below described evoked response measuring set up, which first of all comprises a timing circuit for producing the period T orT of the external stimuli which in each case is non synchronous with the periodic strays e.g. of mains origin.The set up for measuring evoked responses, in particular brain stem auditory evoked responses, for applying the above described method is shown in Figure 4 and comprises a quartz oscillator circuit 1 for generating pulses of frequency fgz of f gz frequency divider circuit 2 with a divisor P providing pulses of frequency 1 T fgz p or 1 T f gz p, a circuit 3 for triggering successive exbernal stimuli in transducers 4 through a stimulator 5 and for triggering simultaneously associated successive sweeps of the averaging procedure in an averaging computer 6, the stimulator 5 with transducers 4 being together the source of the external stimuli e.g.acoustic stimuli, an instrumentation amplifier circuit 7for amplifying the set of signals Uzs which signals are obtained from a subject 8 together with the periodic strays U originated from an environment 9 in which zp 1 the said periodic strays of frequency t are spread and the signals are picked up by means of electrodes 10 of Ag AgCl type, the averaging computer 6 performing the averaging procedure of the said set of signals, and a memory and display block 11 for storing and displaying results of the averaging procedure.Operation of the evoked response measuring set up for applying the averaging method for periodic strays elimination is described below. Pulses of the frequency f or f produced by the gz gz quartz oscillator circuit 1 are directly sent to the frequency divider circuit 2, where the frequency f gz or f is divided by the divisor P. At the output of gz 1 fgz 1 the said circuit 2, pulses of frequency T p or , Z are obtained, which pulses through an interfacing p circuit comprised in the triggering circuit 3 are formed to actuate a triggering input of the stimulator 5 and a triggering input of the averaging computer 6.The said triggering pulses of frequency T or 1 are fed T through the circuit 3 to the stimulator 5 which causes generation of the external stimuli e.g. acoustic stimuli in acoustic transducers 4, from which transducers the stimuli reach the examined subject 8, which subject may be e.g. a human. The stimulator 5 e.g. an acoustic stimulator, after being triggered by a pulse from the triggering circuit 3 produces acoustic stimuli of appropriate loudness level as required. In the example of brain stem auditory evoked responses, the phono stimulator 5 produces external stimuli of rectangular waveform resulting in a pattern effect in the acoustic transducers, while for the traditional auditory evoked responses the phono stimulator 5 produced the external stimuli in form of the acoustic stimuli but of sinusoidal function giving the effect of pure sound.The examined subject 8 is stimulated by the external stimuli in form of acoustic stimuli delivered by the acoustic transducers 4 which pulses through ear and audible nervous path produces an electrophysiological reaction in the pertinent regions of the cortex. The electrophysiological response corresponds to the individual evoked response U ow belonging to the set of signals U The set of zs signals U which comprises the individual evoked zs responses UOw, the internal noise U szw in this case being called an electroencephalogram and the periodic strays U zp originated from the environment 9 provided with mains supply network are picked up by electrodes 10 from the scalp of the examined subject 8.The said set of signals is fed to the differential inputs of the circuit 7 two channel instrumentation amplifier. The said circuit 7 in each of its channels amplifies the said set of signals U zs to match its output voltage with the voltage range of analog inputs of the averaging computer 6. Each triggering pulse starts a successive sweep of the averaging procedure for the set of signals U. zsThe .averaged set of signals Uzs equals the averaged evoked response Uow . The product of the averaging procedure of the set of signals Uzs in the averaging computer 6 is sent from the averaging computer 6 to the block 11 memory and display to provide the possibility for the future display and selection of the result and to provide data for further statistical analysis with the use of a large digital computer.The method is of particular significance in the case of electrophysiological examinations, which determine a degree of deterioration in the nerve conduction paths linking a sense organ and an associated reception area of the cortex, and especially during the reception of brain stem evoked responses.
