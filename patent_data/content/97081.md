# Viscous dampening arrangement for taut band suspension.

## Abstract
An improved viscous dampening arrangement for a taut band suspension system in an electrical indicating instrument includes a hub associated with the stator and a turret associat ed with the rotor. The hub and turret each have central open ings for receiving the taut band. The hub and turret are arrang ed, in use, in a spaced apart facing relationship with the facing portions of hub and turret being tapered in a controlled fashion. A viscous dampening fluid is provided between the hub and tur ret and an anti wetting agent is applied to the surfaces of the hub and turret where the dampening fluid is not desired. The geometry of the tapers is chosen so as to minimize the effects of longitudinal and radial shocks and vibrations on the electrical indicating instrument.
