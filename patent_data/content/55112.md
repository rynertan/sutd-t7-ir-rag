# Felt like layered composite of PTFE and glass paper.

## Abstract
A felt layered composite of the following structure a. a first layer 1 of a predominantly horizontal copla nar superimposed layers of filamentary polytetrafluoroethy lene components interrupted by occasional interlayered orientation b. a thin high density nonwoven layer 2 of fine glass staple fibres c. a scrim fabric 3 of polytetrafluoroethylene fibres and d. a second predominantly horizontal coplanar superimposed layers 2 of filamentary polytetrafluoroethy lene components interrupted by occasional interlayer orien tation wherein the layers are mechanically bonded together by filamentary polytetrafluoroethylene components extend ing vertically throughout the composite and a process for making this composite the composite is useful as a filter fabric and is primarily used for bag filters to remove fly ash from the gaseous combustion products of coal fired fur naces and boilers.
