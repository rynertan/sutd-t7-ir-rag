# Battery pack with electronic means for limiting current flow for powering an electrical device.

## Abstract
An intrinsically safe battery pack arrangement for electri cally powering electrical devices is disclosed. The power pack has a device for electronically determining a short in a cable or device and switching off the voltage to the power pack. The electronic device includes a transisterized circuit for sensing and controlling current through the cable. When the current ex ceeds a predetermined maximum, the circuit limits the current in the cable to a maximum value. The circuit is latched in the off position when the short is present for an extended time and the circuit may be reset after the short is removed and the prob lem corrected. This form of circuitry in power packs for use with mining equipment such as lamps, provides a unit which will not cause hazardous sparks when shorted thereby consti tuting an intrinsically safe device for use in mines.
