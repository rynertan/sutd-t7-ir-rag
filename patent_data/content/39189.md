# Process for producing alkali metal hydroxide.

## Abstract
An alkali metal hydroxide is produced by electrolyzing an aqueous solution of an alkali metal chloride fed into an anode compartment in a cell having an anode compartment and a cathode compartment formed by partitioning with a cation exchange membrane. A cation exchange membrane of a fluorinated polymer having carboxylic acid groups at a con tent of 0.9 to 2.0 meq. g. dry resin is used as said cation exchange membrane and a metal or a metal ion is incorpo rated in said aqueous solution of an alkali metal chloride to form a thin layer made of a metal hydroxide or oxide on the surface of said membrane in the anode compartment.
