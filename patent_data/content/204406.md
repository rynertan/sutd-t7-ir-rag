# Convoluted shaft actuator link especially for glassware forming machines.

## Abstract
An apparatus for use in cyclically moving a member 24 along an arcuate path. Such member may, for example, be a pusher cylinder for moving glassware articles. The apparatus comprises a linearly movable piston 40 for linearly moving a convoluted shaft 180 attached thereto. The convoluted shaft 180 has surfaces thereon which act as tracks for roller bear ings 350 mounted on a hub 182 which is disposed about the shaft. Linear motion of the shaft 180 is converted into rotary motion of the hub by the action of the bearings running on the convoluted sides of the linearly moving shaft. The member 24 is secured to the hub to turn therewith.
