# Method and apparatus for forming thin film oxide layers using reactive evaporation techniques.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to an apparatus and method for forming high quality thin film oxide layers on a substrate by a reactive evaporation process utilizing an oxygen plasma activation source in the form of a cylindrical boule 17 of insulating material surrounded by a radio frequency coil 18 for generating a radio frequency electromagnetic field in the boule of sufficient magnitude to create a self igniting oxygen plasma within the boule without evaporating material from the walls thereof.
