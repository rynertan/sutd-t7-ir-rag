## Description
This invention relates to a protein, designated env AIDS, which is the viral envelope protein of the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the expression vector which encodes env AIDS, the production of env AIDS using recombinant DNA technology and a method for detecting the presence of AIDS antibodies in human blood. From 1981 to date, there have been more than eight thousand 8,000 people diagnosed as having acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS N.Y. Times, A 11 January 11, 1985 . AIDS has been characterized by the onset of severe opportunistic infections secondary to an effect on the body s immune system Gottlieb, M.S. et al., Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia and Mucosal Candidiasis in previously healthy homosexual men evidence of a new acquired cellular immunodeficiency , N. Eng. J. Med. 305, 1426 1431 1981 . The disease has been found in male homosexuals, patients receiving blood products, intravenous drug addicts, and individuals originating from Haiti and Central Africa Piot, P. et al., Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in a heterosexual population in Zaire , Lancet 11, 65 69 1984 . The causative agent was suspected to be of viral origin as the epidemiological pattern of AIDS was consistent with a transmissable disease. At least three 3 retroviruses have been isolated from cultured T cells of several patients with AIDS, or from white blood cells of persons at risk for the disease. A novel human retrovirus called lymphadenopathy associated virus LAV was discovered and its properties were consistent with its etiological role in AIDS. That virus was isolated from a patient with lymphadenopathy and hence the name Montagnier, L. et al., A New Human T lymphotropic retrovirus characterization and possible role in lymphadenopathy and acquired immune deficiency syndromes. In Human T Cell Leukemia Lymphoma Virus, R.C. Gallo, M. Essex and L. Gross, eds. Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory pp. 363 370 . Other human retroviruses, specifically two subgroups of the human T cell leukemia lymphoma lymphotropic virus, types I and III have been isolated HTLV I Poiesz, B.J. et al., Detection and isolation of type C retrovirus particles from fresh and cultured lymphocytes of a patient with cutaneous T cell lymphoma , PNAS USA 77, 7415 7419 1980 HTLV III Popovic, M. et al., Detection, isolation and continuous production of cytopathic retroviruses HTLV III from patients with AIDS and pre AIDS , Science 224, 497 500 1984 . Still another virus, the AIDS associated retro virus ARV , was proposed as the causative agent Levy, J.A. et al., Isolation of lymphocytopathic retroviruses from San Francisco patients with AIDS , Science 225, 840 842 1984 . Both the HTLV III and ARV retroviruses display biological and sero epidemiological properties similar to LAV Levy J.A. et al., supra, Popovic, M. et al., supra . As seen from the above, at least three 3 retroviruses have been postulated as the etiologic agent of AIDS LAV ARV and, HTLV subtypes I and III. LAV, HTLV III and ARV II genomes have been molecularly cloned Schüpbach, J. et al., Serological analysis of a subgroup of human T lymphotropic retroviruses HTLV III associated with AIDS , Science 224, 503 505 1984 Alizon, M. et al., Molecular Cloning of lymphadenopathy associa ted virus , Nature 312, 757 760 1984 . The complete nucleotide sequence of the proviral genome of LAV, ARV and HTLV III has been determined Ratner, L. et al., Complete nucleotide sequence of the AIDS virus, HTLV III , Naure 313, 277 284 1985 Sanchez Pescador, R. et al., Nucleotide sequence and expression of an AIDS associated retrovirus ARV 2 , Science 227, 484 492 1985 Wain Hobson, S. et al., Nucleotide sequence of the AIDS virus, LAV , Cell 40, 9 17 1985 . One reason for the difficulty in determining the etiologic agent of AIDS was due to the reactivity of various retroviral antigens with serum samples from AIDS patients. For example, serum samples from AIDS patients have been shown to react with antigens of HTLV I and HTLV III HTLV I Essex, M. et al., Antibodies to Cell Membrane Antigens Associated with Human T Cell Leukemia Virus in Patients with AIDS , Science 220, 859 862 1983 HTLV III Sarngadharan, M.G. et al., Antibodies Reactive With Human T Lymphotropic Retroviruses HTLV III in the Serum of Patients With Aids , Science 224, 506 508 1984 . Envelope gene products of HTLV demonstrated antigenicities cross reactive with antibodies in sera from adult T cell leukemia patients Kiyokawa, T. et al., Envelope proteins of human T cell leukemia virus Expression in Escherichia coli and its application to studies of env gene functions , PNAS USA 81, 6202 6206 1984 . Adult T cell leukemias ATL differ from acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS in that HTLV I causes T cell malignancies, that is uncontrolled growth of T cell. In AIDS rather than cell growth there is cell death. In fact this cytopathic characteristic of HTLV III was critical to determining ultimately the specific retroviral origin of the disease. Thus the etiologic agent of AIDS was isolated by use of immortalized human neoplastic T cell lines HT infected with the cytopathic retrovirus characteristic of AIDS, isolated from AIDS afflicted patients. Seroepidemiological assays using this virus showed a complete correlation between AIDS and the presence of antibodies to HTLV III antigens Sarngadharan, M.G. et al., supra Schüpbach, J. et al., supra . In addition, nearly 85 of patients with lymphadenopathy syndrome and a significant proportion of asymptomatic homosexual men in AIDS endemic areas were also found to carry circulating antibodies to HTLV III. Taken together, all these data indicate HTLV III to be the etiologic agent for AIDS. Until the successful culturing of AIDS virus using H 9 cell line PCT application, publication no. WO 85 04897 the env AIDS protein of the AIDS virus had not been isolated, characterized or synthesized. This in major part is due to the fact that the virus is cytopathic and thus isolation of the virus was not possible Popovic, M. et al., supra . Once the human T cell line resistant to the cytopathic effects of the virus was discovered, a molecular clone of proviral DNA could be achieved. The need for a sensitive and rapid method for the diagnosis of AIDS in human blood and its prevention by vaccination is very great. Virtually all the assays tests presently available are fraught with errors. In fact the Center for Disease Control CDC has indicated that presently available tests be used solely for screening units of blood for antibody to HTLV III. The CDC went further by stating that the presently available ELISA tests can not be used for general screening of high risk pupulations or as a diagnostic test for AIDS Federal Register 50 48 , 9909, March 12, 1985 . The errors have been traced to the failure to use a specific antigenic protein of the etiologic agent for AIDS. The previously used proteins were derived from a viral lysate. Since the lysate is made from human cells infected with the virus, i.e. the cells used to grow the virus, the lysate will contain human proteins as well as viral proteins. Thus preparation of a pure antigen of viral protein is very difficult. The antigen used produced both false positive and false negative results Budiansky, S., AIDS Screening, False Test Results Raise Doubts , Nature 312, 583 1984 . The errors caused by the use of such lysate proteins peptides can be avoided by using a composi tion for binding AIDS antibodies which is substantially free of the non AIDS specific proteins. Compositions that are substantially pure AIDS envelope protein can be used as antigens. The AIDS envelope protein of the instant invention has been established to have conserved epitopes which permit its use to screen for, diagnose and or prevent by vaccination the infection by AIDS virus. The instant invention demonstrates that the envelope protein with its conserved epitopes includes all the variants which have been claimed as the sole etiologic agent. The envelope AIDS protein of the present invention may be produced by conventionally known methods. The processes by which the novel protein may be produced can be divided into three groups 1 chemical synthesis 2 preparation of a gene prepared by chemical synthesis which is inserted into a host and a protein is produced by the host and 3 a corresponding gene obtained biotechnically is inserted into a host and a protein is produced by the host. In one embodiment of this invention, recombinant DNA techniques are utilized by which env AIDS DNA from a natural source is introduced into a cell to produce the env AIDS protein. One method of obtaining DNA which encodes env AIDS is to read the genetic code in reverse and synthesize an oligodideoxynucleotide which should encode the env AIDS amino acid sequence. As the env protein has not been isolated or characterized this approach cannot be pursued. Alternatively gene expression can be obtained using recombinant DNA technology if DNA isolated from natural sources is used instead of synthetic DNA. This invention is directed to the engineering of HTLV III env gene into suitable expression vectors transformation of host organisms with such expression vectors and production of envelope AIDS protein env AIDS by culture of such transformed cells. Another aspect of the present invention relates to the isolation and use of the resulting recombinant env AIDS protein. Another aspect of the present invention is the identification and determination of the proviral DNA sequence. More specifically, this aspect of the invention relates to determination and comparison of the proviral nucleotide sequence of the envelope genes of the purported etiologic agent of AIDS i.e. lymphadenopathy associated virus LAV , AIDS associated retrovirus ARV and the human T cell leukemia lymphoma lymphotropic virus type III HTLV III . A further aspect of this invention relates to a diagnostic method for testing human blood for the presence of antibodies to the env AIDS protein. This aspect of the invention overcomes the problems of all previously used blood tests for AIDS. One of the problems is the use of compositions to bind AIDS antibody which contain proteins or peptides which were not derived solely from the AIDS etiologic agent. A composition using homogeneous envelope AIDS protein of this invention overcomes the nonspecificity of the prior tests or assays. Yet another aspect of this invention is a diagnostic method for detecting and or determining the presence of the antigen in human blood. Another aspect of this invention is to use the env AIDS proteins of the instant invention as antigens suitable for providing protective immunity against AIDS when incorporated into a vaccine. In the description the following terms are employed The nomenclature used to define the peptides or proteins is that used in accordance with conventional representation such that the amino group at the N terminus appears to the left and the carboxyl group at the C terminus to the right. By natural amino acid is meant one of the amino acids commonly occurring in natural proteins comprising Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Ser, Thr, Lys, Arg, Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln, Cys, Met, Phe, Tyr, Pro, Trp and His. By Nle is meant norleu cine, and by Nva is meant norvaline. Where L and D forms are possible, it is the L form of the amino acid that is represented unless otherwise expressly indicated. In addition, amino acids have been designated by specific letters of the alphabet such that A Alanine B Aspartic Acid or Asparagine C Cysteine D Aspartic Acid E Glutamic Acid F Phenylalanine G Glycine H Histidine I Isoleucine K Lysine L Leucine M Methionine N Asparagine P Proline Q Glutamine R Arginine S Serine T Threonine V Valine W Tryptophan Y Tyrosine Z Glutamine or Glutamic Acid. In accordance with the present invention, the search for the envelope protein of the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS has led to the isolation and sequencing of the proviral gene of the AIDS virus. It has now been discovered, for what is believed to be the first time that the postulated etiologic agents of AIDS, lymphadenopathy associated virus LAV , AIDS associated retrovirus ARV and human T cell leukemia lymphoma lymphotropic virus HTLV III are in fact variants of the same virus. For purposes of this invention, in the specifi cation and claims the virus causing AIDS will be referred to herein as AIDS virus. AIDS virus will be understood to in clude the variants which have been postulated as the causa tive agents of AIDS, namely LAV, ARV and HTLV III. The envelope protein of the AIDS virus env AIDS is a 97,200 dalton protein with 32 potential N glycosylation sites. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the AIDS envelope gene of the putative etiologic agents of AIDS demonstrates that all the viruses are variants of the same virus. That means that there is approximately 1 to 20 divergence or variation from the sequence of the envelope gene of HTLV III and the se quences of the envelope genes of the other viruses LAV and ARV 2. The amino acid sequence of the env AIDS is set forth in Figure 6 a . The amino acid distribution is set forth in Figure 6 b . The nucleotide sequence of the envelope gene is shown in Figure 1. The proviral DNA sequence, using methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art such as the chemical degradation method of Maxam and Gilbert of the M13 sequencing system of Messing which is a modification of the dideoxy nucleotide chain termination method of Sanger, was analyzed to determine the location of the region coding for the envelope protein. The location of an open reading frame, i.e. a long stretch of triplet codons not interrupted by a translational stop codon, for the envelope gene was determined. The open reading frame coding for the env gene is 863 amino acids and contained an ATG codon at the eighth position from the 5 end of the reading frame. The ATG codon is known to be a universal translation initiation codon. The integrated proviral genome of HTLV III was cloned from the genomic DNA of H9 cells infected with HTLV III Shaw, G.M. et al., Molecular characterization of Human T cell leukemia lymphotropic virus type III in the acqui red immune deficiency syndrome , Science 226, 1165 1171 1984 . Since the HTLV III provirus was found to lack XbaI restriction sites, a genomic library was constructed by using XbaI digested H9 HTLV III DNA. There are several methods available to one of ordinary skill in the art for screening the bacterial clones containing the AIDS env protein cDNA. These include, for example, RNA selection hybridization, differential hybridization with a synthetic probe or screening for clones that produce the desired protein by immunological or biological assays. From the genomic library, colonies of cells transformed with DNA that contains the HTLV III sequences were selected by hybridization screening of the library with HTLV III cDNA. The DNA insert of the hybridization positive clone, HXB 3, was excised from the plasmid DNA and sequenced. The predicted product of the env gene shares many features in common with the envelope gene products of other retroviruses. Thus, a hydrophobic region is seen in the middle of the protein amino acids 519 534 which includes a processing site for the cleavage of the precursor protein into exterior and transmembrane proteins. Similarly, the amino terminal end contains a short stretch of hydrophobic amino acids amino acids 17 37 which constitutes a potential signal sequence. The HTLV III envelope precursor differs from the other retroviral envelope protein precursors in that it contains an additional stretch of 180 amino acids at the carboxy terminus. The recent publication of the nucleotide sequences of LAV, ARV 2 and HTLV III Ratner, L., et al., supra Sanchez Pescadon, R., et al., supra Wain Hobson, S., et al., supra allows a detailed comparison of these various isolates obtained from AIDS patients from different parts of the world. HTLV III clones were isolated from AIDS patient lymphocytes obtained from the east coast of the United States, while LAV was isolated from a French man and ARV was isolated from a patient in California. A comparison of the sequence data confirms the earlier observations made using restriction enzyme site analysis which showed approximately 10 variation. The present analysis shows that the various isolates show the greatest amount of conservation in the gag and pol regions while the most divergence occurs in the env region. A comparison of the five env sequences is presented in Figure 2. With respect to the envelope gene, HTLV III and LAV are more closely related to each other than the ARV clone. Approximately 1.6 divergence was observed between the HTLV III HXB 3 and LAV sequence. Among the HTLV sequences, the divergence was about 1.6 . However, approximately 17 divergence was observed between HTLV III and ARV 2 and this was more pronounced in the extracellular region of the envelope gene product Figure 2 . This high rate of divergence could be due to the geographical location from where the two isolates were derived or the time of isolation of these variants. ARV 2 was isolated from the west coast of the United States more recently. The HTLV III isolates for which the nucleotide sequences have been determined were all obtained from the east coast of the United States a year earlier. LAV was obtained from a French patient who appears to have acquired the virus in New York about the same period. The observed differences in the sequence probably reflect divergent evolution of strains separated in time or geography or both. Within the env region, the highest level of divergence is in the extracellular portion of the protein. A wide variety of host cloning vehicle combinations may be employed in cloning the double stranded DNA. For example, useful cloning vehicles may consist of segments of chromosomal, nonchromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences, such as various known bacterial plasmids, e.g. plasmids from E. coli such as pBR322, phage DNA, and vectors derived from combinations of plasmids and phage DNAs such as plasmids which have been modified to employ phage DNA or other ex pression control sequences or yeast plasmids. Useful hosts may include microorganisms, mammalian cells, plant cells and the like. Among them microorganisms and mammalian cells are preferably employed. As preferable microorganisms, there may be mentioned yeast and bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermophilus and Actinomyces. The above mentioned vectors and hosts may also be employed for the production of a protein from a gene ob tained biologically as in the instant invention. Of course, not all host vector combinations may be equally efficient. The particular selection of host cloning vehicle combination may be made by those of skill in the art after due consi deration of the principles set forth without departing from the scope of this invention. Furthermore, within each specific cloning vehicle, various sites may be selected for insertion of the double stranded DNA. These sites are usually designated by the restriction endonuclease which cuts them. For example, in pBR322 the EcoRI site is located just outside the gene coding for ampicillin resistance. Various sites have been employed by others in their recombinant synthetic schemes. Several sites are well recognized by those of skill in the art. It is, of course, to be understood that a cloning vehicle useful in this invention need not have a restriction endonuclease site for insertion of the chosen DNA fragment. Instead, the vehicle could be joined to the fragment by alternative means. The vector or cloning vehicle and in particular the site chosen therein for attachment of a selected DNA fragment to form a recombinant DNA molecule is determined by a variety of factors, e.g., number of sites susceptible to a particular restriction enzyme, size of the protein to be expressed, susceptibility of the desired protein to proteolytic degradation by host cell enzymes, contamination of the protein to be expressed by host cell proteins difficult to remove during purification, expression characteristics, such as the location of start and stop codons relative to the vector sequences, and other factors recognized by those of skill in the art. The choice of a vector and an insertion site for a particular gene is determined by a balance of these factors, not all selections being equally effective for a given case. There are several known methods of inserting DNA sequences into cloning vehicles to form recombinant DNA molecules which are equally useful in this invention. These include, for example, direct ligation, synthetic linkers, exonuclease and polymerase linked repair reactions followed by ligation, or extension of the DNA strand with DNA polymerase and an appropriate single stranded template followed by ligation. It should, of course, be understood that the nucleotide sequences of the DNA fragment inserted at the selected site of the cloning vehicle may include nucleotides which are not part of the actual structural gene for the desired polypeptide protein or may include only a fragment of the complete structural gene for the desired protein. It is only required that whatever DNA sequence is inserted, a transformed host will produce a protein peptide having an immunological activity to the AIDS env protein or that the DNA sequence itself is of use as a hybridization probe to select clones which contain DNA sequences useful in the production of polypeptides proteins having an immunological activity to the AIDS env protein. The cloning vehicle or vector containing the foreign gene is employed to transform a host so as to permit that host to express the protein or portion thereof for which the hybrid DNA codes. The selection of an appropriate host is also controlled by a number of factors recognized by the art. These include, for example, compatibility with the chosen vector, toxicity of proteins encoded by the hybrid plasmid, ease of recovery of the desired protein, expression characteristics, biosafety and costs. A balance of these factors must be struck with the understanding that not all hosts may be equally effective for expression of a particular recombinant DNA molecule. A preferred embodiment of the instant invention is to express segments of the AIDS env protein in E. coli by inserting restriction fragments isolated from the cloned proviral genome into the versatile pEV vrf variable reading frame expression plasmids for details of construction see Example 2 . These versatile pEV vrf plasmids are derivatives of pBR322 which contain the phage lambda P In the present synthesis the preferred initial cloning vehicle is the bacterial plasmid pBR322 ATCC 37017 and the preferred initial restriction endonuclease sites therein are the EcorRI and HindIII sites Figure 3 . Insertion of proviral DNA contained within the genome of H9 cells into these sites provides a large number of bacterial clones each of which contains one of the proviral DNA genes or fragments thereof present in the genome of H9 cells. Only a very few of these clones will contain the gene for env AIDS or fragments thereof. The preferred host for initial cloning and expression of the env AIDS gene in accordance with this invention is E. coli MC 1061 Casadaban, M.J. and Cohen, S.M., Analysis of Gene Control Signals by DNA Fusion and Cloning in E. coli , J. Mol. Biol., 138, 179 207 1980 . The coding sequences for amino acid residues 44 to 640 of the env protein are located downstream of the P In another embodiment of this invention, a second set of expression plasmids were constructed in a similar fashion by deleting sequences between EcoRI and StuI sites which occur 483 bp downstream of the env gene. Again these deletions designated pEV env 205 640 were made in all three reading frames. The translation termination codon used in all of the env expression plasmids is presumably an in frame TAA located 23 bp downstream of the HindIII site in the plasmid. Thus, 8 amino acid residues at the carboxyl terminus are encoded by pBR322 sequences contained within the pEV vrf expression plasmids. There are several approaches to screen for bacterial clones containing env AIDS cDNA. These include, for example, RNA selection hybridization, differential hybridization, hybridization with a synthetic probe and screening for clones that produce the desired protein by immunological or biological assays. Two methods are available to screen using immunological assay screening of bacterial colonies for the presence of protein using antibody and, preferably, the bacterial lysates are electrophoresed, blotted onto a nitrocellulose paper and then probed with the antibody. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, cultures of the E. coli strain MC 1061 transformed with pRK248cIts and the pEV 1, 2, or 3 env 44 640 or pEV 1, 2 or 3 env 205 640 were grown in M9 medium at 30 C to mid log phase and then induced by shifting to 42 C for 2 hr. Samples of the bacterial cultures were then taken and subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Western blot analysis to detect env proteins. The protein blots were treated with antisera to env AIDS proteins isolated either from immunized rabbits or from AIDS patients previously shown to contain high titer antibodies to AIDS antigens. This was followed by incubation with ¹²⁵I labelled Staphylococcous aureus protein A, washing and autoradiography. Similar results were obtained with both sera except that the human serum was found to contain much higher titers of anti HTLV III antibodies and was devoid of all background reactivity with the E. coli proteins. For this reason human antibodies were used in all subsequent characterization. Figure 4 shows the pattern of reactivity of the env AIDS proteins synthesized in bacteria recombinant proteins with anti HTLV III antibodies. The open reading frame in pEV3 env 44 640 encodes a protein that should migrate as a 68 Kd band on the gel. In fact, a 68 Kd band is observed in the lane corresponding to the induced cells containing pEV3 env 44 640 lane C . However, in addition to the 68 Kd band, these cells synthesized proteins of 35 Kd, 25 Kd and 17 Kd which specifically cross reacted with anti HTLV III antibodies. No HTLV III cross reacting bands are evident in the uninduced control Lane b or in a second negative control sample Lane a of induced cells containing a plasmid that directs the synthesis of v bas p21 oncogene product Lacal, J.C. et al., supra . The appearance of multiple bands synthesized from the env gene sequences was an unexpected result. Another unexpected result was the synthesis of env gene products from the plasmid pEV1 env 44 640 where the insert was placed in the wrong reading frame with respect to the initiator codon immediately down stream of the P To confirm the above interpretation and to rule out the possibility that the smaller proteins are not formed as a result of premature termination or from proteolytic cleavage of the larger product, another deletion mutant in which sequences between the KpnI and StuI sites were deleted were constructed. This expression plasmid contains the coding sequences from amino acid positions 205 640 which could code for a protein of 49 Kd. Analysis of the proteins induced from E. coli harboring this plasmid verified that, in fact, these cells synthesize a 49 Kd protein in addition to the 35 Kd, 25 Kd and 17 Kd proteins lane e, Fig. 4 . From these results, it was concluded that pEV3 env 44 640 expression plasmid directs the synthesis of a 68 Kd protein in addition to several additional smaller polypeptides i.e., 35Kd, 25Kd and 17Kd produced from all of the env expression plasmids resulting from internal translation initiation within the env gene. Because anti HTLV III antibodies are found in more than 90 of the AIDS patients, it was of interest to see if the bacterially synthesized env gene products could be used as diagnostic tools for the detection of these antibodies. For this analysis, total cell protein from an induced bacterial culture was fractionated by SDS PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter by Western blotting technique. Strips of the filter containing transferred proteins were reacted with 1000 fold diluted human sera, and the antigen antibody complexes formed were detected by incubation of the strips with 125 I labelled Staphylococus aureus protein A followed by autoradiography. Prominent bands corresponding to reaction of the antibody to the 68 Kd, 35 Kd, 25 Kd and 17 Kd proteins were consistently observed when the serum used was from patients with AIDS syndrome. The results of such assays with different human sera are presented in Figure 5. The negative controls used were normal human sera and serum from a patient with HTLV I infection. No reaction was observed with sera from healthy individuals or from HTLV I infected individuals. The patient sera were derived from all parts of the United States including California and all AIDS patients sera tested so far were found to be posi tive. The results suggest that these antibodies are mainly directed against the protein back bone of the molecule. It appears, therefore, that the env gene products constitute the best diagnostic reagents for the detection of AIDS associated antibodies. The env gene product of the instant invention encompasses a large portion of the protein molecule and contains both the conserved and divergent portions of the molecule. In spite of the divergence observed between HTLVIII and ARV 2 sequences the recombinant env proteins of the instant invention synthesized by the bacteria react with AIDS patient sera derived from both geographical locations of the United States. One hundred percent 100 of AIDS patient sera 50 individual samples, 25 derived from the East Coast of the United States and 25 derived from California tested showed high reactivity. This is strong evidence for the presence of conserved epitopes within the molecule against which the immune system could mount an antibody reaction. The human immune system may thus be mounting an immune response against conserved epitopes of the envelope molecule, as suggested by the reactivity of the AIDS patient sera. The observed divergence between various isolates of HTLV III thus may not pose a problem for the use of recombinant protein as a vaccine. The 68Kd protein is ideally suited for such a purpose since it encompasses a large portion of the gene product and has the unique structural feature of containing both the extracellular hydrophilic region and the membrane associated hydrophobic regions. This structural feature makes it well suited for encapsulation into liposomes which have been used as vehicles for vaccination against other vital envelope proteins. Based on these discoveries it is proposed that in the practice of screening blood for AIDS only AIDS envelope protein or a variant of said protein be utilized. Utilizing the env AIDS protein of the instant invention, human blood can be screened for the presence of antibodies to the AIDS virus. This and other techniques are readily determined, once, as taught for the first time by the present invention, the envelope AIDS protein has been recognized to be the envelope protein of the etiologic agent of AIDS. The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following examples of preferred embodiments of the invention. The integrated proviral genome of HTLV III was recently cloned from the genomic DNA of H9 cells infected with HTLV III Shaw, G.M. et al., supra . The proviral genome which was obtained by using XbaI digested H9 HTLV III DNA contained two internal EcoRI sites within the viral genome and two additional sites in the cloning vector λ J1. These sites were used for further subcloning of the three DNA fragments of 5.5Kb, 4.5Kb and 1.1Kb into pBR322 ATCC No. 37017 . Nucleotide sequence analysis of the proviral genome was determined by the chemical degradation method of Maxam, A.M. and Gilbert, W., Sequencing end labelled DNA with base specific chemical cleavages , Meth. Enzymol. 65, 499 560 1980 . For the sequence analysis, DNA inserts from the three subclones were isolated by electroelution and further cleaved with appropriate restriction enzymes. The DNA fragments were labelled at their 5 ends with γ 32P ATP using polynucleotide kinase, or at their 3 ends with α 32P NTP by filling in with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment . The DNA fragments labelled at the two ends were cleaved with a second enzyme and the fragments labelled at a single end were purified on 5 acrylamide gels and used for sequence analysis. For the sequence analysis of the env gene, a shotgun approach was utilized where the 4.5 EcoRI fragment was cleaved with one of the following enzymes BglII, HindIII, XhoI, AvaII, HinfI and Sau3A and the restriction fragments labelled and sequenced as described above. The nucleotide sequence of the envelope gene used in the present invention is shown in Figure 1. pRC2 is a derivative of pBR322 containing a unique Bgl II site adjacent on the amp pRC23 see Figure 7 was constructed by inserting into pRC2 a 250 bp BglII HaeIII fragment containing the λ P For the construction of the pEV vrf set of plasmids see Figure 8 , plasmid pRC23 was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and the pRC23 EcoRI HindIII vector isolated by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis. The mixture of synthetic oligonucleotides 32, 33, and 34 nucleotides was combined with the mixture of the complementary sequences, heated to 58 C for 5 minutes in 150 mM NaCl, and cooled slowly to allow annealing. 0.1 pmoles of the synthetic duplexes were added to 0.07 pmoles of the pRC23 EcoRI HindIII vector and incubated with T4 DNA ligase at 15 C for 15 hours. Strain RR1 λ cI857 was transformed with the ligation products. Six ampicillin resistant transformants were selected for DNA sequence analysis. Of the six, two contained the expected sequence for pEV vrfl, one for pEV vrf2, and three for pEV vrf3 Fig. 3 . For the expression of the AIDS env gene, one µg of a 2400 bp EcoRI HindIII DNA fragment, which was isolated from the cloned HTLV III proviral genome by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis, was mixed with 0.1 µg of EcoRI HindIII digested vector DNA pEV vrfl, 2, or 3 . After heating at 65 C for 3 minutes, the mixtures were chilled on ice, and 20 µl ligation reactions were assemb led, containing 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4 , 10 mM MgCl₂, 10 mM DTT, 0.3 mM ATP, and 200 units of T₄ DNA ligase. After incubation at 15 C for 4 hours, the reactions were termi nated by heating at 65 C for 5 minutes. The ligation pro ducts were used to transform E. coli strain MC1061 contai ning plasmid pRK248cIts. Transformants were selected on Luria broth agar containing 50 µg ml ampicillin at 30 C for 18 hours. Plasmid DNA was isolated from 1 ml of each culture and subjected to restriction analysis. All 12 iso lates contained the expected plasmid construction. These intermediate constructions were then used to make pEV1, 2, and 3 env 44 640 by deleting the 600 bp between the EcoRI and KpnI sites as described below. Approximately 0.5 µg of plasmid DNA was digested with KpnI and EcoRI. The resulting termini were then treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of all four deoxyribonucleotides at 100 µM at 37 C for 30 minutes. This step results in the filling in of the 5 overhang of the EcoRI terminus and the removal of the 3 overhang of the KpnI terminus. Upon recirculization of the linear plasmid and blunt end ligation of these termini, an EcoRI site is regenerated. Transformants containing plasmids with the expected deletion were identified by restriction analysis. A second set of deletion derivatives, designated pEV env 205 640 was constructed in a similar fashion. A portion of the linear plasmid that had been digested with EcoRI and KpnI and treated with Klenow, as described above, was further digested with StuI. Again, upon recircularization and blunt end ligation, the EcoRI site was regenerated however, an additional 483 bp of env coding sequences were removed. Cultures of E. coli strain MC 1061 transformed with plasmid pRK248cIts and the pEV1, 2, or 3 env plasmids were grown in M9 medium containing 0.5 glucose and 0.5 casamino acids at 30 C to mid log phase and then induced by shif ting to 42 C for 2 hr. The cells were collected by centri fugation and processed as described in Examples 4 and 5. A homogeneous recombinant viral env AIDS was purified according to the following procedure. The env AIDS protein expressed by a microbe tends to associate with the membrane fractions of the host microbe, principally the inner membrane of the microbe. The following purification method was designed to deal with this finding. This purification method comprises More specifically, the preferred purification method for the preparation of substantially pure recombinant viral env protein comprises In carrying out this method it is preferred that the cells be lysed by sonification, although it is forseeable that other known methods such as enzyme or mechanical lysis could also be used. It is preferred that the cell membrane component, specifically the inner and outer membranes, be isolated from other cellular components by methods such as centrifugation. It has been found that env AIDS expressed by the transformed microorganism tends to become associated with the cellular membranes. Therefore, isolation of these membranes during the purification process ensures high purification levels and high purity env AIDS at the end of the purification procedure. Once the cell membranes are isolated from the lysate mixture, they are washed with an extraction solution, preferably salt solutions and a detergent to yield a second solution containing approximately 50 env AIDS protein. Preferably the cell membranes are washed in four separate steps with the salt solutions and detergent although it is forseeable that certain of these steps could be combined, rearranged or eliminated. The first step of washing the cell membrane may be done with a salt solution, preferably 1M NaCl. In the second step the cell membrane is washed with a detergent solution, preferably 1 Triton X 100. In the third step, the cell membrane is washed with another salt solution, 1.75M to 3.5M guanidine HCl. The final wash is also with a salt solution preferably about 7M Guanidine HCl. The wash solution which results from the fourth and final wash comprises about 50 env AIDS. The final 50 env AIDS wash solution is then further purified by a chromatography step, preferably reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography HPLC . The HPLC step yields env AIDS protein in a substantially 100 pure form. It is also foreseeable that monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography columns utilizing env AIDS polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, could be used as an alternative to HPLC. Cells were lysed by resuspending the cell pellets approximately 10⁸ cells in TG buffer 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 glycerol , mixed with an equal volume of 2 x sample buffer Laemmli, U.K., Cleavage of Structural Proteins During the Assembly of the Head of Bacteriophage T4 , Nature 227, 680 685 1970 and incubated at 95 C for five 5 minutes. Cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation and the cleared lysates were subjected to SDS PAGE analysis Laemmli, U.K., supra . For Western blot analysis, the pro teins from the acrylamide gel were electroblotted onto a 0.1 µm nitrocellulose membrane Schleicher and Schuell for 16 hr at 50V, in 12.5 mM Tris, 96 mM glycine, 20 methanol, 0.01 SDS at pH 7.5. Processing of the blot was carried out using the methods described by Towbin, H. et al. Electrophoretic Transfer of Proteins From Polyacrylamide Gels to Nitrocellulose Sheets Procedure and Some Applica tions , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 76, 4350 4354, 1979 . For treatment with the human sera, the blots were incubated with a 1000 fold dilution of the sera in antibody buffer 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 M NaCl, 1 BSA and 0.05 Tween 20 for 2 6 hr. The blots were then washed twice with phosphate buffered saline containing 0.05 Tween 20 and then incubated with 125 I labelled Staphylococous aureus protein A for an additional period of 1 hr. The blot was then washed twice in PBS Tween 20 buffer, dried and autoradiographed. It is clear that in spite of the divergence observed between HTLVIII and ARV 2 sequences, the recombinant proteins synthesized by the bacteria react well with AIDS patients sera derived from both geographical locations of the United States. One hundred percent 100 of the AIDS patients sera tested showed high reactivity 50 individual samples, 25 from the east coast of the United States and 25 from the west coast of the United States . Thus all the env proteins contain at least one conserved epitope. All of the human sera from AIDS patients tested contained antibodies to the env proteins of the instant invention. This strongly suggests that these env proteins with the conserved epitopes would be immunogenic in man. It will be readily appreciated that the env proteins of the instant invention can be incorporated into vaccines capable of inducing protective immunity against the AIDS virus. By methods known in the art, the specific amino acids conprising the epitopes of the env protein may be determined. Peptides may then be synthesized, comprising an amino acid sequence corresponding to an epitope of an env AIDS protein either in monomeric or multimeric form. These synthetic peptides may then be incorporated into vaccines capable of inducing protective immunity against AIDS virus. Techniques for enhancing the antigenicity of such peptides include incorporation into a multimeric structure, binding to a highly immunogenic protein carrier, for example, keyhold limpet hemocyanin, or diphtheria toxoid, and administration in combination with adjuvants or any other enhancers of immune response. In addition, the vaccine composition may comprise antigens to provide immunity against other diseases in addition to AIDS. An amino acid sequence corresponding to an epitope of an env protein either in monomeric or multimeric form peptide may be obtained by chemical synthetic means or by purifica tion from biological sources including genetically modified microorganisms or their culture media. The peptide may be combined in an amino acid sequence with other peptides in cluding fragments of other proteins, as for example, when synthesized as a fusion protein, or linked to other anti genic or non antigenic peptides of synthetic or biological origin. The term corresponding to an epitope of a env protein will be understood to include the practical possi bility that, in some instances, amino acid sequence varia tions of a naturally occurring peptide may be antigenic and confer protective immunity against AIDS infection. Possible sequence variations include, without limitation, amino acid substitutions, extensions, deletions, interpolations and combinations thereof. Such variations fall within the contemplated scope of the invention provided the peptide containing them is antigenic and antibodies elicited by such peptide cross react with naturally occurring env protein or non variant repeated peptides of env protein, to an extent sufficient to provide protective immunity when administered as a vaccine. Such vaccine compositions will be combined with a physiologically acceptable medium. The size and shape of epitopes found in carbohydrate antigens have been extensively studied, but less is known about the structure of epitopes from protein molecules. Some epitopes of protein antigens have been defined at the level of their tertiary structure. In every instance, the epitopes were formed not by the primary sequences alone, but by the juxta position of residues brought together by the folding of the polypeptide chain s of the native molecule. In addition, the structure of the 68Kd env protein of the instant inven tion makes it particularly well suited for use as a vac cine. The 68Kd env protein comprises a large portion of the gene product which a was shown to be reactive with all the AIDS sera tested and b has the unique structural feature of containing both an extracellular hydrophilic region and the transmembrane hydrophobic regions. The latter struc tural feature makes it well suited for use as a vaccine using liposome encapsulation to create a vehicle for administration. Routes of administration, antigen dose, number and frequency of injections are all matters of optimization within the scope of ordinary skill in the art, particularly in view of the fact that there is experience in the art in providing protective immunity by the injection of other related antigens to provide immunity in other viral infections. It is anticipated that the principal value of providing immunity to AIDS infection will be for those individuals who have had no previous exposure to AIDS, e.g., individuals who are in the high risk population, such as homosexuals, drug addicts and people from Haiti and Central America and individuals who may be receiving blood transfusions. It is also anticipated that temporary immunity for infants may be provided by immunization of mothers during pregnancy. It is clear that the env gene proteins of the instant invention may be used as diagnostic reagents for the detection of AIDS associated antibodies. It is also apparent to one of ordinary skill that a diagnostic assay for AIDS using polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies to the AIDS env protein of the instant invention may be used to detect the presence of the AIDS virus in human blood. In one embodiment a competition immunoassay is used where the antigenic substance, in this case the AIDS virus, in a blood sample competes with a known quantity of labelled antigen, in this case labelled AIDS env protein, for a limited quantity of antibody binding sites. Thus, the amount of labelled antigen bound to the antibody is inversely proportional to the amount of antigen in the sample. In another embodiment, an immunometric assay may be used wherein a labelled AIDS env antibody is used. In such an assay, the amount of labelled antibody which complexes with the antigen bound antibody is directly proportional to the amount of antigen AIDS virus in the blood sample. In a simple yes no assay to determine whether the AIDS virus is present in blood, the solid support is tested to detect the presence of labelled antibody. In another embodiment, monoclonal antibodies to AIDS env protein may be used in an immunometric assay. Such monoclonal antibodies may be obtained by methods well known in the art, particularly the process of Milstein and Kohler reported in Nature 256, 495 497 1975 . The immunometric assay method is as follows Duplicate samples are run in which 100 µl of a suspension of anti body immobilized on agarose particles is mixed with 100 µl of serum and 100 µl of soluble ¹²⁵I labelled antibody. This mixture is for specified times ranging from one quarter hour to twenty four hours. Following the incubation periods the agarose particles are washed by addition of buffer and then centrifuged. After removal of the washing liquid by aspiration, the resulting pellet of agarose particles is then counted for bound ¹²⁵I labelled antibody. The counts obtained for each of the complexes can then be compared to controls. While the invention has been described in terms of certain preferred embodiments, modifications obvious to one with ordinary skill in the art may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, it is understood that the env AIDS DNAs described herein represent only the precise structure of two naturally occurring gene segments. It is expected that slightly modified alleles will be found encoding for similarly functioning proteins, and such gene segments and proteins are considered to be equivalents for the purpose of this invention. It is also suspected that other variants in addition to those described herein will be found and that the envelope protein of said variants will differ slightly. These variant envelope proteins are likewise considered within the scope of the invention. DNA having equivalent codons is considered within the scope of the invention, as are synthetic gene segments that encode homologous proteins of the viral envelope. Various features of the invention are set forth in the following claims.
