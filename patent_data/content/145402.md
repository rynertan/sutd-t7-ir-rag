## Description
This invention relates to a brake pressure control system for a vehicle, the system having the features of the pre characterising portion of the main claim. It is well known to provide a vehicle with one or more brake pressure reducing valves which operate, under certain conditions, to provide a brake pressure to the rear brakes which is lower than the pressure applied to the front brakes. Such pressure reducing valves may be made load conscious whereby the characteristics of the valve arevaried in accordance with both static and dynamic loading of the vehicle. Vehicle loading may be sensed by incorporating the valve as a load bearing component in a suspension assembly which interconnects the sprung and unsprung parts of the vehicle, whereby the whole or a significant part of the load transmitted from the sprung to the unsprung parts of the vehicles is applied to the valve. Such an arrangement is shown in GB A 1557006. In the alternative, the valve may be separate from the suspension and may be provided with a sensing spring which applies to the valve a force determined by the relative position of the sprung and unsprung parts of the vehicle. It is with a control system incorporating this type of valve that the present invention is concerned. Since the relative position of the sprung and unsprung parts is dependent on vehicle loading, such an arrangement does render the valve load conscious. However, no significant part of the vehicle load is transferred from the sprung to the unsprung part of the vehicle by the valve since the sensing spring is light and only serves to sense the position of the unsprung part relative to the sprung part. A prior art arrangement of this general type is shown in GB A 1252700. Whilst valves of the non load bearing type have various advantages which will be known to those skilled in the art, prior art valves of this type have suffered from a disadvantage, described in more detail below, whereby under certain operating conditions the pressure applied to the rear brakes is considerably less than optimum. These problems can be resolved if the usual arrangement of position sensing spring, in which during certain normal operating conditions the spring applies no force to the control piston of the control valve, is replaced by an arrangement in which the position sensing spring applies a force to the control piston under all normal operating conditions. This can be achieved if the control valve is provided with an internal bias spring which acts in opposition to the position sensing spring. An arrangement of this type is shown in US A 3909074. In control valves of the type shown in US A 3909074 the force of the external spring increases as the static loading of the vehicle increases, thereby providing a higher cut in pressure when the vehicle is more heavily laden. If the control valve is used in association with the rear axle of the vehicle, and is arranged such that the spring force provided by the external spring increases as the vehicle is more heavily laden, then, for any given vehicle loading, the force applied by the external spring will decrease progressively during progressively heavier braking as a result of weight transfer from the rear axle to the front axle of the vehicle. Prior to the present invention, it had been thought that the decrease in the force applied by the external spring as a result of weight transfer effects was not sufficient to materially affect the operating characteristics of the valve. It has now been found that the reduction in the force provided by the external spring is not insignificant as had previously been thought, but rather the force applied by the external spring reduces significantly under heavy braking conditions due to weight transfer effects. The present invention is characterised in that the ratio of the area of the piston A₁ which is exposed to the pressure prevailing at the inlet to the area A₂ of the piston which is exposed to the pressure prevailing at the outlet is such that upon an increase in the brake input pressure P₁ the product of the input pressure P₁ and the area of the piston exposed to the inlet pressure A₁ will always increase by more than the resulting decrease in the external spring force as a result of weight transfer effects. As a result of the invention the characteristics of the braking system under heavily laden conditions are improved as compared with the prior art. The invention will be better understood from the following description of the prior art and of a preferred embodiment of the invention, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 shows schematically a typical prior art valve Figure 2 is a graph showing the characteristics of the valve of Figure 1 Figure 3 shows schematically a valve for use in an embodiment of the invention and Figure 4 is a graph showing characteristics of the valve of Figure 3. Referring firstly to Figure 1 there is shown schematically a typical prior art brake pressure reducing valve 1 of the type employing an axle position sensing spring separate from the vehicle suspension. In use the valve is, for example, mounted on the vehicle body and is connected to the rear axle by a position sensing spring which applies to the control piston 2 a force S dependent on the relative position of the rear axle and body. As the rear axle and body move towards each other with increased vehicle loading the force S increases. The sensing spring is set such that when the vehicle is stationary and carrying only the driver the force S is small and is substantially zero at the cut in pressure of the valve 1 the pressure at which the valve 1 will begin to provide a lower pressure at the outlet 3 than the pressure at the inlet 4 . Thus the cut in pressure under driver only conditions is determined by the equation For driver only conditions the general equilibrium equation of the valve 1 at pressure above cut in is Thus, for driver only the cut in pressure is determined solely by the spring 5 and the rise in outlet pressure at pressures above cut in is determined mainly by the area ratio When the vehicle is laden the position sensing spring will apply a force S to the control piston and the cut in pressure is given by It has previously been thought that, for any given vehicle loading, the rate of reduction in S K due to weight transfer is substantially less than the rate of increase in P₁A₁ and above cut in the rise in outlet pressure will again be determined mainly by the ratio However, it has now been found upon more detailed analysis of vehicle dynamic characteristics that the reduction in factor S K is not insignificant as had previously been thought, but rather the factor S K reduces significantly during braking due to weight transfer to the front of the vehicle. This has an adverse effect on the ratio of input to output pressure and results, under extreme conditions, in the phenomenon that a rise in P₁ produces a smaller rise in the factor P₁A₁ than the resultant decrease in the factor S. Thus, a rise in P₁ produces a Referring now to Figure 3 the valve 10 comprises a body 11 housing a control piston 12 carried by a piston rod 13 which is acted upon by a position sensing spring not shown . The piston 12 houses a valve 14 which is normally held open by a pin 15 secured to the valve body 11 but which closes as the piston 12 moves to the right and thereby interrupts communication between the inlet 16 and outlet 17. An internal bias spring 18 applies a substantially constant force K to the piston tending to close the valve 14. The bias spring 18 acts in opposition to the position sensing spring, but the position sensing spring is designed and set so that it always applies to the control piston a force S which is greater than the substantially constant force K of the bias spring 18. Cut in pressure P The position sensing spring is set such that under driver only conditions the correct cut in pressure is obtained. The position sensing spring characteristics are selected so that the desired progressive increase in cut in pressure is obtained with progressive increase in vehicle loading. Above cut in pressure, the valve of Figure 3 satisfies the following equation for both driver only and laden conditions The driver only characteristics OA B and fully laden characteristics OC D of the valve of Figure 3 are plotted in Figure 4. It will be appreciated that the line OC D of Figure 4 provides a much better approximation to the ideal curve Y than does the line OCE of Figure 2, and that this is achieved without sacrificing the driver only characteristics. Whilst the above described valve is of general utility, it is particularly useful in an X split system a system in which each front brake is linked to the diametrically opposed rear brake which incorporates anti lock controls on the front brakes only. In such a system, an impending front wheel lock will result in automatic relief of brake pressure in the front wheel in question and in the diametrically opposed rear wheel. When the brake pressure is reapplied, the cut in point of the reduction valve associated with the rear wheel in question will be lower than upon initial application because of weight transfer caused by the other brakes. If the valve of Figure 1 is used, there will be little or no increase in output pressure after cut in, and indeed there may be a decrease. If the valve of Figure 3 is used, however, the output pressure will rise rapidly after cut in due to the high ratio of It will be appreciated that in the above described arrangement according to the invention the valve provides a variable output in accordance with weight transfer effects even in the case of driver only loading. In addition to enabling better rear brake utilization in the case of straight line braking, the invention offers significantly better braking on cornering in the driver only case when two valves are employed as part of an X split system. This is because the two valves associated with the X split system will be located adjacent the respective rear wheels and will thus detect the transverse weight transfer which occurs during cornering. the effect will be to prevent locking of the more lightly laden inner rear wheel and to provide better utilization of the more heavily laden outer rear wheel, even in the driver only case.
