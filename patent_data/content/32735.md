# Method and system for controlling a vehicle mounted air conditioner.

## Abstract
A vehicle mounted air conditioner includes a com pressor which, when powered by the vehicle engine, sup plies pressurized refrigerant to an evaporator to increase its cooling capacity, a heating unit located downstream of the evaporator and partially occupying the passage of air cooled and directed toward vehicle interior by the evapora tor, and a mixing damper pivoted at a point upstream of the heating unit to adjust the amount of cool air presented thereto in relation to the air directed toward the vehicle in terior. The compressor is coupled to the engine when the temperature in the vehicle interior indicates a demand for a temperature decrement, or decoupled from the engine when the interior temperature indicates a demand for a temperature increment. A control system detects when the compressor is switched from a first operating state to a second state and initiates a timing action to measure the elapse of time from the time of detection of the occurrence of the transient condition. A time varying signal is generat ed when the measured amount of time reaches a predeter mined value for controlling the mixing damper to gradual ly vary the amount of air presented to the heating unit in relation to the air directed to the vehicle interior.
