# Method of splicing strips of thermoplastic material and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
In a method of splicing strips 10, 11 of thermoplastic material to form waterstop joints, the strips 10, 11 are first clamped in longitudinal alignment with their adjacent ends spaced apart. While the strips 10, 11 are so clamped, a routing tool 25 is used to cut complementary rebates at these adjacent ends, after which the strips are moved into end abutting relationship while the longitudinal alignment of the strips is maintained, the rebated ends being brought into a half lap configuration. The cooperating ends are then welded together by means of an electric heating element which was inserted between the ends prior to their being clamped together.
