# GAS SENSOR

## Abstract
The housing 1 of a gas sensor carries a diffusion barrier 2 for restricting the access of gas to the sensing element 4 and a filter 3 mounted between the diffusion barrier 2 and the sensing element 4. As a result, gas reaching the filter 3 must first pass through the diffusion barrier 2 so that its flux is substantially reduced and the life of the filter is increased correspondingly.
