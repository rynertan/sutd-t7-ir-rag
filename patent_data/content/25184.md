# Slider retainer apparatus.

## Abstract
A slide 13 slidably mounted on an arm 11 secured to an indexing plate 12 has a slider seat 15 for supporting thereon a slider body 16 with its pull tab 19 inserted in a slot 18 defined between the slide 13 and the arm 11 . The slider pull tab 19 is immovably held in the slot 18 by a ball 27 mounted in the arm 11 and spring biased into an aperture 25 in the pull tab 19 . Upon holding of the pull tab 19 , the slide 13 is slightly moved under the resiliency of a spring 22 to lift the slider body 16 until a locking pawl 20a to which the pull tab 19 is connected is withdrawn out of a slider guide channel 21 . A block 31 mounted on a fixed frame 32 contains a spring biased presser 34 which, upon lateral alignment with the spring biased ball 27 , forces the ball 27 into locking engagement with the pull tab 19 in the slot 18 , thereby locking the slider 17 for application to a pair of sliding clasp fastener stringers.
