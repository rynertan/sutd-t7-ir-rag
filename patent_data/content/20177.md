# Fixed disc head actuator assembly.

## Abstract
An actuator assembly for magnetic heads used with fixed magnetic discs. The heads 14 are supported from one end 13 of arms 11 in a support assembly which is pivoted at the other end. Drive forces are applied directly to each of the arms through the support assembly at the center of percussion between the pivot and the heads. Drive forces are generated by a drive assembly including a coil 32 and permanent magnets 43, 44.
