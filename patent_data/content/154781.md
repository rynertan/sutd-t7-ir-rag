# Optical waveguide connector.

## Abstract
A connector for axially aligning a pair of optical waveguides 74 is disclosed comprising a receptacle 62 , a pair of plug members 33, 34 for positioning in the recep tacle bore 64 and a pair of retention sleeves 10 for posi tioning within respective plug members 33, 34 . Each plug member 33,34 is adapted to receive a respective optical waveguide cable 74 therein, and provides a forward align ment nose portion 38 having a profiled opening receiving a forward end 76 of the waveguide 74 . The opening is defined by opposed V grooves 52, 54 , with the V grooves being separated by a transverse slot 56 which extends through the alignment nose portion 38 . The nose portion 38 further includes external protrusion means 58 for engaging the receptacle, and causing the opposed V grooves 52, 54 to wedge against the waveguide 74 ex tending therebetween. Each retention sleeve 10 is secured onto the optical cable 74 and within the bore 46 of a respective plug member 33, 34 , for inhibiting rearward withdrawal of the optical cable 74 from the plug member.
