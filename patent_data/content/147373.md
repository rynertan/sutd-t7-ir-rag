# Method of producing electroacoustic converters, preferably microphones, and converters produced according to the method.

## Abstract
An electroacoustic converter with a closed off resonance chamber, e.g. a microphone, includes frame 1 carrying an electrode 2 and a diaphragm 3 together with means for electrical connection 5 . A band 17 of plastically deform able material is sellingly attached to the frame via a joint 15 for providing good base reproduction. The sensitivity of the microphone, which depends on the volume of the resonance chamber, is adjusted to the desired value by an impression 16 in the band. When in production, the frames 1 are attached to the band 17 and are conveyed with its aid between different operation stations. Sensitivity is measured with the aid of a measuring apparatus 20 and a loudspeaker 18 and is adjusted by a tool 19 .
