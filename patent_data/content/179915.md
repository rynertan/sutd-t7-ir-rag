## Description
This invention relates to a liquid crystal display device, which is used for displaying images, for instance, and has a plurality of display electrodes provided in a liquid crystal cell and selectively driven for display by thin film transistors. Fig. 1 shows a prior art liquid crystal display device structure of the conventional type as described in Japanese Patent Application No. 59 10988. The device comprises a pair of glass or like transparent substrates 11 and 12 facing each other and spaced apart by by a spacer 13 provided therebetween along the edges. Liquid crystal. 14 is sealed between substrates 11 and 12. Substrates 11 and 12, spacer 13 and liquid crystal 14 constitute a liquid crystal cell. Formed on the inner surface of substrate 11, for instance, are a plurality of display electrodes 15 constituted by a transparent conductive film. Thin film transistors 16 are formed contiguous to display electrodes 15 with their drains connected thereto and serve as switching elements. Common electrode 17 is formed on the entire inner surface of other transparent substrate 12 and faces display electrodes 15. Display electrodes 15 may serve as picture element electrodes. They are square in shape and are arranged in a closely spaced apart relation to one another, as shown in Fig. 2. More specifically, they are arranged in rows and columns on transparent substrate 11. Gate buses 18 are formed near and along the individual rows of display electrodes 15. Source buses 19 are formed near and along the individual columns of display electrodes 15. Thin film transistors 16 noted above are formed at the intersections of gate and source buses 18 and 19. More specifically, each thin film transistor 16 is formed with its gate connected to associated gate bus 18, its source connected to associated source bus 19 and its drain connected to corresponding display electrode 15. In operation, a voltage is applied between a selected one of gate buses 18 and a selected one of source buses 19. Corresponding thin film transistor 16 is turned on as a result, whereby charge is stored on display electrode 15 connected to the drain of this on thin film transistor 16. A voltage is applied across a portion of liquid crystal 14 that is found between this display electrode and common electrode 17. This display electrode alone, is thus rendered transparent or opaque. Only selected display electrodes are rendered transparent or opaque in this way, whereby a corresponding display image is formed. Usually, a polarizer not shown is incorporated to render selected display electrodes transparent or opaque. Thin film transistor 16 usually has a structure as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Referring to the Figures, display electrodes 15 and source buses 19 are formed from a transparent conductive film, e.g., an ITO film, which is formed on transparent substrate 11. Semiconductor layers 21 of amorphous silicon or the like are formed such that each of them strides portions of corresponding display electrode 15 and source bus 19 which extend parallel to and are closely spaced apart from each other. Gate insulating film 22 of silicon nitride or the like is formed on semiconductor layers 21. Gate electrodes 23 are formed on gate insulating film 22 such that they overlie portions of display electrodes 15 and source buses 19 via the semiconductor layers 21. The gate electrodes 23 are each connected at one ends to the corresponding gate buses 18. Portions of the display electrodes 15 and source bus 19 facing each gate electrode 23 serve as drain and source electrodes 15a and 19a, respectively. Each thin film transistor 16 is constituted by corresponding electrodes 15a and 19a, semiconductor layer 21, gate insulating film 22 and gate electrode 23. Gate electrodes 23 and gate buses 18 are formed at a time from aluminum, for instance. This example of liquid crystal device is used for color display and has red, green and blue filters 1R, 1G and 1B provided on the side of transparent substrate 12. Filters 1R, 1G and 1B each face corresponding display electrode 15. These color filters are distributed substantially uniformly as shown in Fig. 3. Light source 24 is provided behind transparent substrate 11, as shown in Fig. 4. More specifically, light from light source 24 or any other external light is transmitted through the liquid crystal display device according to the controlled state of the liquid crystal cell. The display state of the device can be seen from the side of transparent substrate 12. Semiconductor layer 21, particularly amorphous silicon, has photo conductivity. Semiconductor layer 21 is receiving light from light source 24 and or external light at all time. Therefore, the off current in each thin film transistor 16, i.e., current present in thin film transistor 16 when it is off , can not be made sufficiently small, that is, the on to off current ratio of each thin film transistor 16 can not be made sufficiently large. That is undesired from the standpoint of sufficient contrast, particularly when thin film transistors 16 are driven in a high duty cycle operation. The liquid crystal display device further comprises a polarizer not shown , which is provided on either side surface of the liquid crystal cell. The device may be either of a normally black type or so called negative type where no light is transmitted unless a voltage is applied between common electrode 17 and any display electrode 15 or of a normally white type or so called positive type where light is transmitted in the absence of voltage applied between common electrode 17 and display electrode 15. In the prior art liquid crystal display device, light 25, 26 Fig. 4 transmitted through portions of the device other than the portions occupied by the display electrodes reduces the display contrast and color purity, thus deteriorating the image quality. Particularly, in the device of the normally white type the same light as that which is transmitted through a display electrode 15 of a 100 white level is transmitted through portions between adjacent color filters and has a great adverse effect on the image quality. An object of the invention is to provide a liquid crystal display device, in which thin film transistors have a high on to off current ratio and a sufficient contrast can be obtained even if the thin film transistors are driven at a high duty ratio, and which can be manufactured comparatively easily, as well as a method of manufacturing the same liquid crystal display device. Another object of the invention is to provide a liquid crystal display device, in which thin film transistors can be driven with a high duty ratio, and which permits to obtain a satisfactory image quality having high contrast and color purity, as well as a method of manufacturing the same liquid crystal display device. The objects of the invention are solved by a liquid crystal display device comprising first and second transparent substrates closely spaced apart and facing each other, a liquid crystal sealed between said first and second transparent substrates, a plurality of transparent display electrodes provided on the inner surface of said first transparent substrate, thin film transistors formed on said first transparent substrate in correspondence to the respective display electrodes and each having a drain electrode connected to the corresponding one of said display electrodes and a transparent common electrode formed substantially on the entire inner surface of said second transparent substrate, wherein said thin film transistors each including a semiconductor layer formed between corresponding drain electrode and source electrode, a gate insulating film formed on said semiconductor layer on the side opposite from said first transparent substrate and a gate electrode formed on said gate insulating film If necessary, second source buses connected to the source electrodes may be formed together with these source electrodes, that is, each source bus may have a double layer structure consisting of the opaque metal layer and the layer of the same material as of the source electrode. The opaque metal layer thus formed prevents light necessary for the display from reaching the semiconductor layer of the thin film transistor. A sufficiently high resistance of the semiconductor layer thus can be provided while the thin film transistor is off . A display having excellent contrast thus can be obtained even if the thin film transistors are driven with a high duty ratio. Besides, the opaque metal layers can be formed together with the source buses, and hence comparatively easily. Further, metal light blocking layers are formed on areas of the inner surface of the transparent substrate, which faces the transparent substrate with the display electrodes formed thereon, the areas corresponding to the gaps between adjacent display electrodes. In the case of a color liquid crystal display device, the light blocking layers are formed between adjacent color filters. The common electrode is preferably formed on these light blocking layers. Where this arrangement is applied to particularly a liquid crystal display device of normally white type, light is blocked at all time by portions of the device where light on off control is not performed according to display information. It is thus possible to obtain a satisfactory image quality having high contrast and color purity. The main part of the liquid crystal display device and method of manufacturing the same according to the invention resides in the thin film transistors. Therefore, the invention will now be described in conjunction with an example of the method of forming display electrodes and thin film transistors with reference to Figs. 5A to 5G. As transparent substrate 11 of the liquid crystal display device, as shown in Fig. 5A, is used a glass substrate, for instance. Opaque metal layers 29 are formed on areas of substrate 11 where thin film transistors 16 are to be formed. At this time, source buses 31 of the same material as opaque metal layers 19 are formed. For instance, opaque metal layers 29 and source buses 31 are formed by depositing chromium to a thickness of 1,000 to 2,000 angstroms on the entire surface of transparent substrate 11 and then photo etching the deposited chromium layer. As is seen from Fig. 5A, source buses 31 are formed such that they extent along and near the individual columns of square display electrodes 15. Opaque metal layers 29 are actually extensions of the source buses 31 on one side thereof. In Fig. 5A, the areas occupied by display electrodes 15 are shown by phantom line rectangles. Subsequently, an insulating layer 32 is formed to cover the entire surface of transparent substrate 11 inclusive of the opaque metal layers 29 and source buses 31, as shown in Fig. 5C. The insulating layer 32 is then formed with holes 33 which correspond in position to source electrodes 19a of thin film transistors 16. The insulating film 32 desirably is transparent and has a low dielectric constant. For instance, it is of SiO₂, and has a thickness of 5,000 angstroms to 1 micron. Then, drain and source electrodes 15a and 19a facing each opaque metal layer 29 are formed, as shown in Fig. 5D. Drains 15a are constituted by part of display electrodes 15. These electrodes 15 and 19a are transparent for instance, they may be of ITO and formed to a thickness of 500 angstroms or below. At this time, the source electrodes 19a are connected to source buses 31 through the holes 33, and thus electrically connected to the opaque metal layers 29. If necessary, second source buses 19 connected to the source electrodes 19a are formed at the same time. The electrodes 15a and 19a and the second source buses 19 are formed at a time by depositing a transparent metal film and photo etching the deposited film, the process being well known in the art. The second source buses 19 have the same disposition and shape as those in the arrangement shown in Fig. 3. Further, each second source bus 19 of a transparent metal and corresponding source bus 31 of an opaque metal are connected to each other by placing directly one upon the other at one ends thereof at a source terminal 34, as shown in Figs. 5H and 5I. Likewise, these buses are connected together at the other ends. Semiconductor layer 21, e.g., of amorphous silicon, is then formed on the insulating film 32 such that it extends between and partly overlies the drain electrode 15a as part of display electrode 15 and the source electrode 19a, as shown in Fig. 5E. The semiconductor layer 21 entirely faces the opaque metal layer 29 or the source bus 31 via the insulating layer 32. Its thickness is 0.5 micron or below. Gate insulating film 22 is then formed to cover the semiconductor layer 21 entirely, as shown in Fig. 5F. The gate insulating film 22 may be a SiN Fig. 6 partly shows an example of liquid crystal display device of color display type, which is produced using transparent substrate with display electrodes 15 and thin film transistors 11 noted above. In the Figure, parts like those in Figs. 3. 4 and 5A to 5G are designated by like reference numerals and symbols. This example is one, in which color filters 1R, 1G and 1B corresponding to the display electrodes 15 are formed on the transparent substrate 12, and the metal light blocking layers 37 are formed to close the gaps between adjacent color filters. The light blocking layers 37 may be made of aluminum, chromium, etc. and have a thickness of 2,000 to 3,000 angstroms, which may be formed by means of deposition or spattering. The device of Fig. 6 is formed by first forming the color filters 1R, 1G and 1B on the transparent substrate 12, then forming the light blocking layers 37 to close the gaps between adjacent color filters and then forming the common electrode 17 to cover the entire surfaces of color filters and light blocking layers 37. However, it is also possible to first form light blocking layers 37 and then form the color filters. As a further alternative, it is possible to first form the common electrode 17. The description so far has concerned with the color liquid crystal device. However, the invention is also applicable to liquid crystal display devices of monochromic display type and also to liquid crystal display devices of light reflection type. Further, the invention is applicable to various other kinds of liquid crystal display devices. For example, bar like segment display electrodes arranged in the form of a figure eight may be selectively driven for the display of numerals. As has been shown in the foregoing, with the liquid crystal display device according to the invention light from the light source 24 for display or any other external light is blocked by the layer 29 and never reaches semiconductor layer 21. Thus, it is possible to ensure a sufficiently high off resistance of each thin film transistor 16 and hence a sufficiently high on to off current ratio thereof. Satisfactory contrast thus can be obtained even when thin film transistors 16 are driven with a high duty ratio. Further, since opaque metal layers 29 are formed along with source buses 31, it can be formed comparatively easily and without particularly complicating the structure. An intent to increase the density of display electrodes 15 will lead to a sacrifice in the width of source buses 31 and increase the possibility of occasional disconnection of the buses. The formation of second source buses 19 will alleviate this difficulty. That is, the second source buses 19 provide for a double layer structure of the source buses to improve reliability and increase yield even with a high density large area liquid crystal display device. In a still further aspect, with the prior art liquid crystal display device shown in Figs. 3 and 4, light from light source 24 is transmitted through a selected source bus 19, between which and common electrode 17 a voltage is applied, thus deteriorating the contrast of display. Particularly, in the case of the color display the display color becomes lighter. With the liquid crystal display device according to the invention, the source buses 31 formed together with the opaque metal layers 29 are opaque. Therefore, light is never transmitted through any selected source bus 31. The contrast thus is improved that much, and also there is no possibility for the display color to become lighter. Furthermore, with the provision of light blocking layers 37 to close the gaps between adjacent color filters, there is no possibility of transmission of undesired light through the gaps between adjacent color filters. This promotes the improvement of the contrast and color purity, and hence the image quality. Further, the formation of color filters 1R, 1G and 1B produces surface level differences along the edges of the filters. These stepped filter edges are liable to cause separation of a portion of common electrode 17 overlying a color filter. Even if this results, light blocking layers 37 may ensure electric connection of such a portion on a color filter to the common electrode 17. To this end, the structure of Fig. 6 is suited. In addition, with the common electrode 17 formed on the previously formed color filters, voltage application across part of liquid crystal 14 between the common electrode 17 and any display electrode 15 may be achieved more efficiently than in the case of the prior art structure shown in Fig. 4. It may be thought to form the light blocking layers 37 as a black filter. The black filter, however, must be formed as a lamination of a red filter, a green filter and a blue filter. Therefore, the mask alignment involved are cumbersome. In addition, a considerable thickness is necessary to be able to block light sufficiently. This means that the formation of the black filter requires a great deal of attention. In contrast, the metal light blocking layers 37 may be formed easily.
