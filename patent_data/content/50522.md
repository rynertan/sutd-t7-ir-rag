# Method for regeneration and re utilization of discharged gas and arrangement employed therefor.

## Abstract
A method for the regeneration and re utilization of discharged gas for use in a vulcanization which employs an inert gas which method comprises the steps of regenerating a mixture of inert gas discharged from a vulcanizing unit and a vulcanizing medium by subjecting the mixture to a steam separation subjecting an elastomer product mounted in a metal mould to a preshaping by supplying the inert gas obtained from the steam separation to the vulcanizing unit prior to beginning the vulcanization, and subjecting the inert gas obtained from the steam separation to supplemen tary pressurization by inert gas obtained from an inert gas generating unit when the said inert gas is to be supplied to the vulcanizing unit.
