# Water in oil emulsion explosive composition.

## Abstract
A water in oil emulsion explosive composition contain ing hollow microspheres obtained by firing volcanic ash and having a specific gravity of 0.05 0.1 and an average particle size of 10 100 Âµm has improved explosion performance and safety over water in oil emulsion explosive composition containing conventional hollow microspheres.
