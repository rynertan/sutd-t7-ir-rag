# Method of crosslinking poly alpha olefin series resins.

## Abstract
A method of crosslinking poly α olefin series resins, comprising the steps of subjecting a resin composition to graft reaction under a volume ratio of oxygen to the resin composition set at less than 0.1 and at temperatures ranging between the thermal decomposition temperature of the radical generating agent and 230 C, said composition comprising at least one kind of poly α olefin series resin of poly propylene series resin, poly butene 1 series resin or poly 4 methyl pentene 1 series resin a radical generating agent of dibenzoyl peroxide or t butyl perbenzoate and a silane compound having the general formula of RR SiY2, where R is a monovalent olefinically unsaturated hydrocarbon group or hydrocarbonoxy group, Y is an organic group capable of hydrolysis, and R is a monovalent hydrocarbon group except aliphatic unsaturated hydrocarbon groups, or the group Y or R defined above, and bringing the resultant graft polymer into contact with water so as to cause cross linking reaction under the action of a silanol condensation catalyst added to the reaction system before or after the graft reaction step.
