## Description
SMOKE RETARDED POLYMERS The present invention relates to cmposit1ons comprising elastomeric polymers and halogen contain ing organic compounds that exhibit substantially reduced smoke generation upon burning as a ra ul of the presence therein of a smoke retarding amour of zinc oxide. Synthetic materials undergoing formed combustion emit smoke and toxic gases that are dangerous fire hazards because they impair escape, produce injury, limit survival and hamper fire fighting efforts, The latest statistics indicate that about half of the fatal ties from accidental fires are caused by smoke rather than by heat or actual burning, thus emphasizing the need for the development of synthetic organic materials with as minimal smoke generating properties as possible.This is especially true for such materials used in aircraft, watercraft, motor vehicles, and house interiors, as well as for furniture and the like. It is, there fore, of great importance to provide a smoke retarda.t r compositions comprising elastomerflc polymers and halogen containing organic compounds. Such compositions would be particularly useful for sheathing wire and cable. Zinc oxide is well known and widely used as a component of the curative systems for many elastomers.However, it is generally used at relatively lo.r concentrations, i.e., about 5 parts or less by weight of tin oxide per hundred parts by weight of elastomer. Zinc oxide, as well as other zinc compounds, has also been described as a smoke retardant for a va riety of polymers, including polyvinyl chloride, chlori nated polyester, polystyrene, acrylonitrileAutadiene styrene terpolyners, and polypropylene. See for example U. S. Patent 3,996,142 French Patent 2,236,893 U. S. Patent 3,945,974 U. S. Patent 3,900,441 U. S. Patent 3,957,723 and U. S. Serial No. 638,404 filed December 8, 1975. In most of thc prior art examples, zinc com pounds are used in compositions where the halogen con taining organic compound is the only, or mayor, polymeric component. In cases where zinc compounds have been used with a halogen material as the minor component, smoke retardation was small less than 20ss . Surprisingly, in the present invention, smoke reductions of greater than 40 are obtained, even though the halogen containing organic material Is a minor component. Smoke iphi bition of this magnitude has been previously obtained only when a halogenated polymer was used as the sole polymeric material. The present invention relates to a corposition comprising 90 to 50 parts by weight of an elastomeric polymer component, correspondingly 10 to 50 parts by weight of a halogen containing organic component and zinc oxide present in an amount equal to at least 5 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of said elastomeric polymer component and said halogen containing organic component. Th one of its embodim.ents, the present invention relates to a method of preparing a composition comprising 90 to 50 parts by weight of an elastomeric polymer component and correspondingly 10 to 50 parts by weight of a RTI ID 3.16 halogen containing organic component, said compositIon exhibiting substantially reduced smoke generation upon burning, said method comprising adding at least 5 parts by weight of zinc oxide per hundred parts by weight of said elastomerlc polymer component and said halogen containing organic component during formulation of said composition.In another embodiment, th present invention relates to a method of imparting the property of exhibiting substantially reduced smoke generation upon burning to a compos it ion comprising 90 to 50 parts by weight of an elastomeric polymer component and correspondingly 10 to 50 parts by weight of a halogen containing organic component, said method comprising adding at least 5 parts by weight of zinc oxide per hundred parts by weight of said elastomeric polymer con ponent and said halogen containing organic component to said composition during formulation of said composition. The elastomeric polymer component which is used in te aforementioned compositions and methods of the present invention comprises at least one elastomer polymer which does not contain halogen. Examples of such elastomeric polymers are polyurethane and the nitrile elastomers. Exemplary of the polyurethane polymers which are operative In the present invention are those described in Polyurethane Technology11, by Bruins, Interscience Publishers, pages 198200 and in Modern Plastics Encyclopedia , 1968, page 289. Examples of such polymers are such polyether based polyurethanes as those made from 1 equivalent of polytetramethylene ether glycol. 2 to 5 equivalents of methylene bis 4phenyl isocyanate and 1 to 4 equivalents of 1,4 butane diol and polyester based polyurethanes such as are similarly derived from l,4 butane diol adipic acid polyester and MDI Rubber Chemistry and Technology, Col. 35, 1962, page 742, Schollenberger et al. . Com mercially available materials of this category includeEstane trademark , Texin trademark 480 A, Roylar trademark E 9.Many such products may be described as reaction products of a polymeric polyol e.g., a polyester glycol or a polyether glycol with an organic polylsocyanate whether aromatic, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic , usually a diisocyanate, frequently along with a low molecular weight bifunctional material having two reactive hydrogens, such as glycol or diamine see also U. S. Pat.Nos. 3,462,326, Steele et al.,August 19, 1969, especially col. 3, lints 1 o 35 also 3,678,129, Fischer, July 18, 1972, col. 3, ilne 65 to col. 2, line 9 and col. 3, lines 19 30 Thermoplastic polyurethane polymers are high molecular weight materials substantially devoid of oleftnic tinsaturation wherein essentially all the NCO groups have reacted with the active hydrogen containing components. Por the preparation of semi rigid and rigid polyurethanes, polyols having relatively lower molecular weight e.g., 100 may be employed in part or in whole for the higher molecular weight reactants depending on the degree of semi rigid or rigid properties desired. Exemplary of the nitrile elastomers which are operative in the present invention are those which have high unsaturation and which are conventionally vulcanized with sulfur. Such nitrile elastomers include those which are copolymers of butadiene and acryli and methacrylic nitriles containing 5 to 50 by weight of nitrile. These elastomers are made in a manner well kno.m to those skil l d in the art, usually by emulsion polmerization, for example in accordance with U. S.Patent No. 1,973,000, and are available under the trademark of Chemigum Good ear Chemical Div. , year Goodrich Chemical Nysyn Copolymer Rubber Chemical and Paracril Uniroyal Chemical . The halogen containing organic component which is used in the compositions of the present inventIon com prises at least one halogen contadning organic compound, which may or may not be a polymer. Examples of such com pounds are chlorinated paraffins, polyvinyl chloride and chlorinated polyethylene. The halogen content of the halogen containing organic component should be from about 20 to 75 weight percent. When chlorinated paraffins are employed in the present invention, their chlorine content is preferably from about 30 to 70 weight percent. An example of a suitable chlorinated paraffin is Chlorowax 70 trademark . The polyvinyl chloride resin employed in the invention is a well known conventional material. It is represented by such commercially available resins as Marvinol or Esso PVC trademarks . Frequently the polyvinyl chloride resin employed has a K value a function used as a measure of molecular weight see H. Finkents cher, Cellulosechemie 13, 60 1932 from 50 to 79. The chlorinated polyethylene employed in the present invention is likewise a known material, being a resin produced by chlorination of polyethylene. Various forms of the chlorinated polyethylene reins employed may be described as elastomers having glass transition tempera tures of 30 C. to 20 C. and chlorine contents of 25 to 50 weight percent. The mechanical strength of chlorinated polyethylene is a function of the moiecuiar weight of polyethylene used, the degree of residual crystallinity and the arrangement of chlorine atWks on tfle bckbone. Chlorinated polyethylenes are commercially available under the trademark Tyrin . The maximum amount of zinc oxide that may be added to the compositions of the present invention is about 50 parts by weight per one hundred parts by weight of co position, Above such 2 ratio, the physical properties of the composition would become undesirable. Preferably, the compositions of the present invention contain 30 parts by weight, and more preferably 20 parts by weight, of zinc oxide per 100 parts by weight of composition. Other compounding ingredients may be used in the compositions of the present invention, including light and heat stabilizers, waxes, pigments, lowing agents, flame retardants, other smoke retardants ters such as carbon black, silica, barytes, , magnesium oxide, calcium carbonate, aluminum oxide trihydrate and the like. Among the flame retadants usable in the present invention are the Diels Alder reaction products of 2 moles of hexachlorocyclopentadiene with 1 mole of either 1,5cyclooctadiene, Furan, 2 vinyl 2 norbornene or 4 vinyl cylohexene resulting in the formation of 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 c, 10, 13, 13, 14, 14 dodecachloro 1,4,4a,6a, 7, 10, lOa, 12a octahydro 1,4 7, lO dimethanodibenzocyclooctane DCCO 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 10, 11, 11 dodeca chloro 1,4,4a,4b, 5, 8, 8a, 9a octahydro 1,4 5,8 di methanodibenzofuran DCOB 6 1 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7 ,7 hexa chloronorborn 5 T ren 21 yl 1,2,3,4,10,10 hexachloro l,4, 4a,5,6,7, 8, 8a octahydro l,4 5, 8 dimethanonaphthalene DCDN or 6 1 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7 ,7 hexachloronorborn 5 en 2 yl 1, 2,3,4,10, 10 hexachloro 1,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a octahydro 1,4 methanonaphthalene DCMN . The preparation of those. flame retardants is given in U. S. Patent 3,970,715. These flame retardants are preferably used in the compositions of the present invention in an amount equal to about 10 to 25 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of elastomer for example, polyurethane or nitrile rubber . Antimony trioxide Sb2O3 may be added to the compositions of the present invention in order to reduce the amount of flame retardant required. uhen antinony trioxide is included, the amount of the other flame retardant may be reduced to as little as 5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of elastomer, provided that the sum of the amounts of antimony trioxide and flame retardant is about 15 to 30,preferably 20 to 25, parts by aJeigh per hundred parts by weight of elastomer. For elastomers containing po3Nninyl chloride but not for elastomers containing chlorinated polyethylene, as little as 5 parts by weight of antimony trioxide, zSth no additional flame retardant per 100 parts by weight of elastomer plus polyvinylchloride is required for flame retardance, with 5 to 10 parts by weight of antimony trioxide being preferred. When antimony trioxide is used as a flame re tardant, either by itself or in combination with an other of the flame retardants referred to above, addi tional amounts of antinony trioxide beyond those amounts indicated could be used. However, the use of more than 20 parts by weight of antimony trioxide per 100 parts by weight of composition, would not be preferred because of the expense involved. The materials used in the illustrative, non limiting, examples below were prepared by mixing the components on an electrically heated two roll mill. The elastomeric component was added first and fluxed until a uniform band was formed. The additional ingrc dients were then added and dispersed by standard millmixing techniques. The úniformZy mixed material was then sheeted off the mill in the form of a blank for compression molding. The blank was placed in a 311 x 6 x 1 16 frame mold, which was in turn placed between the platens of a steam heated hydraulic press. The heated material was molded under a pressure of 4500 psi for 5 minutes and then cooled in place under pressure. Smoke testing was carried out on a 3 x 3 x 1 16 sample, cut from the molded material prepared as previously described. Testing was done in the NationalBureau of Standards NEW Smoke Density Chamber, according to Method NFPA 258. Tests were performed in the flaming mode. The results reported in the following examples represent data from a single determination.In each case, maximum specific optical density of the smoke produced, corrected for soot deposits on optical windows Dm corr was determined. when zine oxide is added to the compositions of the present invention during formulation of said compositions, mixing should take place at a sufficiently high temperature so that the polymers of the composition flow sufficiently and adequate mixing results, but not at such a high temperature that one or more of the polymers becomes degraded. A temperature rage of about 275 F. to 400 F. would be suitable for most polymers.while the pressure is not critical, the pressure should not be so high that excessive shear is created that results in degradation of one or more of the polymers. Example I Samples were mixed and molded according to the procedures described above, using a molding temperature of 3400F. The results of smoke testing are shown inTable I.

This example shows that no appreciable smoke retardation is obtained at ZnO concentrations less than 10 parts per hundred. Rowever, at a ZnO concentration of 20 parts per hundred, a major smoke reduction is obtained, comparable to effects described for zinc com pounds in the presence of halogen polymers alone. Example 2 Samples were mixed and molded according to the procedures described above, using a molding temperature of 2800F. The results of smoke testing are shorn inTable IT.

Therefore, the per cent smoke reductions of the samples containing zinc oxide represent minimum values. This example shows that substantial smoke retardation is obtained at 5 parts ZnO per 45 parts elastomer, that smoke retardation increases with increasingZnO concentration, and that the effectiveness of ZnO at 20 parts per 45 parts is significantly greater than at parts per 45 parts or less. Thus although zinc oxide has generally been used at relatively lo concentrations, i.e., less than five parts per hundred, by weight, as a component of the curative systems for many elastomers, it has surprising ly been found that zinc oxide at somewhat higher concentrations, i.e., greater than 5 parts per hundred of elastomer by weight, preferably greater than 10 parts per hundred by weight, and more preferably greater than 20 parts per hundred by weight, is extremely effective as a smoke retardant.
