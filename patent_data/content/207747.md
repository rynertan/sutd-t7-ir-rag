# Process and apparatus for manufacturing low sulfur cement clinker.

## Abstract
A process and apparatus for manufacturing low sulfur cement clinker from cement raw meal containing sulfur or with fuel containing high levels of sulfur or a combination thereof. The process is carried out in an apparatus which includes a preheater 1 , calcining surface 2 , clinkering furnace 3 and clinker cooler 4 . A separate source of fuel 70 is added to the feed end 41 of a kiln 40 of the clinker ing furnace 3 to maintain reducing conditions and temper atures for decomposing the sulfur compounds. Fresh air is added to a riser duct 56 connecting the clinkering furnace 3 with the calcining furnace 2 and the preheater 1 for converting sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide. Calcium oxide is added to the riser duct 56 for absorbing the sulfur trioxide to form calcium sulfate. The calcium sulfate is then removed by a gas solid separator 74,174 from the system. Excess fuel added to maintain reducing condition at the feed end 41 is utilized in the calcining furnace 2 .
