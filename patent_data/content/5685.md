# Brush, particularly apt to clean W.C.vessels.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a hygienic brush, particularly for W.C. vessels, in which the brushing portion of said hygienic brush comprises a flexible support 2 from which the brush bristles 2 spread out, such a support having the form of a hollow cap provided with holes 3 disposed among said bristles 2 and apt to communicate the interior of said cap with the exterior, such a cap being in communication with a reservoir containing a mixture 4 of substances apt to hygienically treat and to deodore the surfaces of the W.C. vessel, such a reservoir being in its turn apertured in order to be penetrated by a water jet which removes partly the mixture, said mixture being then discharged through the holes of said hollow cap in order to provide for the treatment of the vessel surfaces during the brush employ.

## Description
Brush particularly apt to clean W.C. vesselsThis invention concerns a brush particularly apt to clean W.C. vessels.The cleaning of the hygienic sanitary installations, particularly for water closet vessels, is at present executed using brushes which perform the cleaning combining a rubbing action of the brush with a waster jet.This mode oP procedure, however, allows to remove from the concerned zones only solid substances or residuals. To obtain a deeper cleaning the user must pour on the surface to be cleaned anyone of the deterqents available on the market. This operation, however, allows to obtain the cleaninq but does not solve the problem of bad smells. The latter are at present eliminated using deodoring packages which are positioned in the most suitable location, for example suspended on the border of the W,C, vessel. Said packaqes present the disadvantages to be within the reach of children, to easily release and to fall in the bottom of the vessel syphon and to be unaesthetic. This invention is related to a brush partizRarly forW.C. vessel, said brush, besides to remove solid substances with the aid of a water iet, is able to deterge, to deodore, to disinfect or to execute any other treatment of the surfaces of the same vessel.The hygienic brush of the invention is of the kind wherein the brushing portion is constituted by a support in plastic yieldable moulded material integral with the brush bristles projecting outwardly, said brushing portion being insertable to the end of a handle and is characterized by the fact that said plastic support is in the form of a hollow cap, from which the brush bristles spread out, such a hollow cap being provided with holes interposed among the bristles and communicating the interior of said hollow cap with the exterior, a reservoir being provided near said cap and communicating with the interior of the same cap and being provided with suitable holes and containing a mixture of substances, having a liquid or solid form, apt to clean, to deodore , to disinfect or to execute any other treatment on the walls of the W.C. vessel, the whole in a way that the jet of washing water, during the use, penetrates into said reservoir, dissolving or removinq partially said substances, to discharge trough the holes provided on the cap of the brushing portion, to contact the bristles and the surface to be cleaned.The object of the invention is shown with reference to the accompanying drawinqs, referrinq to some embodiments of the invention, wherein. Figure 1 is an axial cross section oP the brush of the invention in a first embodiment Figure 2 is a second embodiment, in axial cross section Figure 3 is a third embodiment Figure 4 is a further embodiment concerning a brush not provided with an elongated handle.As shown in figure 1, the hygienic brush oP the invention is composed by a brushing portion constituted by a support 2 in plastic yieldable material, such as P.V.C., from which the bristles 2 of the brush spread out integrally, in radial direction. The support 2 has the form of an internally hollow cap opened, from a part, for the insertion of a hollow handle 1, preferably in a metal resistant to oxidation,such as brass. The handle 1 has its end 1 entering the support 2, said end being opened or in any case communicating with the internal recess of said support, while the opposed end can be closed by a plug 7 prePerably applied by screwing.From the side opposed to the handle, the support 2 is provided with holes interposed among the bases of the bristles 2 , said holes being of a diameter and a number such as to allow a water jet, investing the brushing portion, to penetrate inside the recess and to come out therefrom. In the case of figure 1, both the handle and the recess of the support 2 constitute a reservoir for containinq deterging, deodoring, disinfectinq substances and or for other objects, said substances, from time to time, are dissolved and removed from the water penetrating inside the support 2 and then it is possible, during the employ of the brush, besides to remove the solid residual substances, also to execute on the walls of a W.C. vessel all the treatments necessary for the hygienic preservation of said walls.In the case wherein the mixture 4 of substances disposed inside the handle 1 and the cap 2 is composed by solid substances, it may be provided in a granulous form, or in the form of tablets or candles. Whatever is the form of said substances, they can be introduced from the distal end of the handle 1 after removing the plug 1 .In case the substance used is a mixture of liquid substances, the holes 3 will have a slit form apt to pass the liquid substance exerting with a handle a pressure on the cap 2 in order to squirt, from time to time, the liquid material through said slits.In the embodiment of figure 2 there is only the handle acting as a reservoir and its end entering inside the support 2 is closed, so as the communication between the interior of the handle and the recess of the support 2 takes place through communicating holes 5, so that the water entering inside the support 2 can arrive inside the handle through an annular gap 6 provided between the support walls and the cylindrical outer wall of the handle 1 and through the holes 5 distributed alonq the cylindrical wall of the same handle.In this case the holes 5 can be also provided outwardly the support 2, so that the water jet enters directly inside the handle and therefrom arrives inside the support 2 carrying the dissolved substances and comes out from the holes 3.In the embodiment of figure 3 there is the support 2 acting as a reservoir, so that the removal of the substan ces takes place by means of water enterinq and qoinq out through the holes 3. In this embodiment there will be the necessity of a more frequent recharge of the reservoir, but there is the advantaqe to proportion from time to time the amounts of substances which have to be dissolved, avoiding unuseful wastes of the same substances. In the case of figure 4, the brush is embodied in such a form that its body 2 constitutes the handle of the brush and is inwardly filled with the substances to be removed by water, in this case the bristles 2 and the holes 3 will be obtained on a particular surface, preferablv flat.The support 2, acting as a handle too, will be provided with a filling hole, not shown, closed by a suitable plug.Tn all the above examined cases, the cleaninq, deodorization, disinfection, besides to interest the vessel wall s, interest also the brushing portion which always remains cleaned, deodored and disinfected, with a remarkable advantage from the hygienic point of view.
