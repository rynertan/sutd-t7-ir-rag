## Description
Ij jLL EI L IS ETTL WITH BUILT IN CLEANING A HEAD COMPLIANCE PADSThis invention relates to data storage systems . which use a flexible magnetic disk. While such disks are quite rugged and do not require the same standard of care as hard disks,It ic nevertheless necessary to provide some measure of protection to avoid surface contamination which would degrade performance.The protection assures that dust, fingerprints and other contaminants are not allowed to reach the surface of the disk and interfere with the recording process. In addition to pl otecting the disk from contamination, the enclosure should provide for cleaning the disk to remove the contaminants which will inevitably reach the surface. Since the disk is flexible and must be held in contact with the mägnetic transducer, some form of backup plate or pressure pad must be used to hold the disk against the transducer. The enclosure must accommodate magnetic transducers for access to both sides of the disk.The most common form of flexible magnetic disk enclosure is an envelope of flexible plastic material having apertures for the drive hub and access by the magnetic transducer. The envelope usually has some form of non woven wipe material which is designed to rub against the disk and remove the contaminating materials which enter the envelope. Because the disk must have adequate clearance to rotat freely within the envelope, the contact between the wipe material and the surface of the disk is intermittent and unpredictable. The absence of any force urging the wipe material and the disk into engagement makes it difficult to obtain good cleaning action.To overcome the poor cleaning characteristics it has become common to use various means to apply pressurize to opposite sides of the envelope to force the wipe material against the disk surface. This technique has been satisfactory tc meet the requirements for reliability and accuracy in the past but it s complexities and cost in future applications are handicaps. It would be very desirable to eliminate the mechanism used to apply pressure since such mechanisms require maintenance, adjustment and often times, repair.The principal object of the invention is to provide a flexible disk enclosure which provides improved cleaning action without the need for mechanical devices on the associated drive. This is accomplished by a disk enclosure of rigid material. The enclosure contains the usual flexible magnetic disk and non woven wipe material.A transducer access opening in the form of a radial slot in one of the rigid sides provides a location where. the magnetic transducer can interact with the disk. On the other side of the enclosure, opposite the transducer access opening, is a radial ridge. This ridge acts as a pressure pad for the magnetic transducer and also forces the non woven wipe material into close contact with the disk. The wipe material dislodges dirt particles and other foreign particles and traps them in the material where they do not interface with the reading or recording operation. Since the ridge is an integral part of the disk enclosure, no additional mechanical elements are required to achieve the improved cleaning action.Since transducer apertures can be provided on both sides of the enclosure, both sides of the disk can be cleaned. 11l some applications it may not be expedient ol necessary to have two transducer openings. In such situations, the ridge alone serves to hold the wipe material in sufficiently close relationship to the disk surface to provide good cleaning action. Altenlatively, a second transducer opening can be provided simply for cleaning purposes. Fig. 1 is an exploded isometric view of a magnetic disk enclosure according to one embodiment of the invention.Fig. 2 is an isometric view of an aSsembled encldsureFig. 3 is a sectional view taken along line IIILIII of Fig.2.Fig. 4 is a sectional view taken along line IV IV of Fig. 2.In Fig. 1 a flexible magnetic disk 1 is disposed between an upper wiper 2 and a lower wiper 3 made of a non woven material. A first side 4 and a second side 5 are molded from a plastic material such as Acrylonitrile Butadi.ene Styrene. Each side has a depressed outer area 41 and 51, respectively as well as a central aperture 42 and 52 which allows a drive spindle, not shown, to engage flexible disk 1. Side 4 has a second aperture 43 which provides access for a magnetic transducer which reads and records data on flexible disk 1.A slot 21 in the non woven wiper material 2 allows a transducer inserted through aperture 43 to bear directly against the first surface of magnetic disk 1. Side 5 has a corres bonding second aperture 53 which, in conjunction with slot 31 ill non wovei wiper material 3, allows a second magnetic transducer to engage the second surface of magnetic disk 1.Opposite slots 43 and 53 in sides 5 and 4 respectively are ridges 54 and 44. These ridges are slightly elevated regions which project above the surface of central arenas 41 and 51.The ridges serve as a substitute for the commonly used pressure pad and prevent the flexible disk from flexing away from the magnetic ti ansducer during a data transfer operation. In addition the ridges serve to force the non woven wipe material against the surface of the flexible disk to provide good cleaning action.Fig. 2 shows an assembled disk with parts cut away to expose the ridge. It can be seen that pressure exerted by a magnetic transducer inserted through aperture 53 will cause disk 1 to bear against non woven wiper material 2 and ridge 44. This provides a pressure pad arrangement to assure good head to disk engagement and also improves the cleaning action.Fig. 3 taken along the line Ill Ill of Fig. 2 shows the configuration of ridge 54. It can be seen that the non woven material 3 is forced into engagement with disk I by ridge 54.Fig. 4 is a sectional view along the line IV,IV of Fig. 2 showing the magnetic disk 1 sandwiched between non woven wipe material 2 and 3. The first side 4 and second side 5 are joined at the edges 10 11 and 12 13 by thermo compression bonding or a suitable cement. Returning to Fig. 1, the side 4 and the side 5 are geometrically identical and can therefore be made from the same mold.The 900 displacement of slot 43 from slot 53 allows adequate space for the transducer access mechanisms so that both transducers can be accessing the disk 1 at the same time.The thickness of sides 4 and 5 afford protection to disk 1 which is not available with the usual flexible envelope. Since disk 1 is spaced away from the outer surfaces of side 4 and 5, it is less prone to pick up contaminants from objects in contact with the surfaces.
