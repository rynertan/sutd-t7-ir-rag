## Description
This invention relates to a composition or formulation and a process by which a relatively neutral flavor gel ingredient is produced and incorporated in a base dough for the preparation of soft, edible, baked products, especially soft cookies in varieties such as chocolate chip, peanut butter, molasses, etc., the soft, edible, baked products having a surprisingly long and extended shelf life. More particularly, the preferred raw materials, utilized to prepare the neutral flavor gel, in proportions and in a manner described in greater detail hereinafter, comprise a high fructose corn syrup, an alginate gum, and calcium sulfate dihydrate. High shear mixing of the gel ingredients assures the attainment of a substantially homogeneous, lump free gel which is suitable for grinding. Traditionally, adequate moisture, softness and freshness have been retained in soft cookies and snacks through the use of ground raisins or other fruit pastes incorporated into the dough. These materials, however, impart a fruity taste to the dough that is acceptable in oatmeal apple, or raisin flavored cookies, for example, but is not appropriate for soft chocolate chip, peanut butter, molasses or other varieties of soft, non fruit tasting cookies, snacks and the like. It is, therefore, among the primary objects of the invention to provide a suitable replacement or substitute for ground fruits or fruit pastes that has the desired properties of bland flavor, high moisture retention properties in baked products, compatibility with dough mixing and handling processes, and costs comparable to the prior art fruit pastes. It is another object of this invention to provide a firm gel system, which is shelf stable in character and which can be stored in sealed shipping units for indefinite periods of time and later distributed to baking locations or plants for production of soft textured cookies, biscuits, snacks and the like. Edible gel formulations are known in the art, but they are usually based on an aqueous system and used for filling baked products, for example, jelly filled doughnuts and jelly rolls. U.S. Patent No. 3,352,688, describes an aqueous based light bodied gel containing a water soluble alginate which is said to be free from gumminess and is heat and freeze resistant. Typical of the prior art, this teaching relates only to the filling utilized in baked goods, and not to the preparation of a soft textured, moisture retaining, cookie dough. German patent publication DE A2,420,622 and corresponding French patent 2268476 teach a gel composition for use as a coating or topping or filling for baked goods which gel quickly and quickly become firm enough for cutting. The base mass of the gel consists of a mixture of 25 to 55 parts by weight of sodium alginate, 0 to 30 parts by weight sodium hexameta phosphate and either 3 to 10 parts by weight calcium hydrogen phosphate or 5 to 20 parts by weight calcium citrate. Production of a grindable firm gel which is incorporated into a dough for producing soft textured baked products is not taught or suggested. In another teaching, typical of the prior art, U.S. Patent 3,342,612 discloses dessert gels which have the capacity to gel at room temperatures. This is said to be of particular advantage in tropical or subtropical, low income regions where refrigeration often is not available. Once again, the gel is based on an aqueous system, which in this instance utilizes carrageenin to prepare the dessert gel. U.S. patent 3,892,871 discloses that the use of corn syrup as substantially the only sugar or the use of corn syrup of higher fructose content than normal instead of just a mixture of sucrose and water and or fruit juice improves the properties of jellies. The jellies are taught as having improved appearance, mouthfeel, and spreadability on bread or fragile crackers. The jellies comprise corn syrup, a flavoring material such as a natural flavor or fruit or vegetable juice, a polysaccharide or proteinaceous gelling agent including edible gums, an acidifying agent and an optional preservative or adjuvant. However, production of a grindable gel for producing soft textured baked goods is not taught or suggested by the reference. Another aspect of applicants invention involves the use of a humectant such as glycerine in the preparation of the gel system. Humectants, of course, have long been used in the food industry, and more particularly in the preparation of baked goods. One such teaching relevant to this point is US A 3,656,967, believed to cover the familiar Pop Tart dessert or breakfast items. Typically they comprise a fruit filled product, adapted to be heated in a common toaster oven for one to two minutes. Heating produces the desired eating quality wherein the filling softens to a plastic or gelled condition and the crust has a crisp fresh baked texture. A hydrophilic agent or humectant, such as glycerine or sorbitol in the filling retains moisture in the filling. There is no teaching of incorporating the humectant into a grindable gel composition for use in a dough. In US A 3,493,382, a molded edible product e.g., for a child s toy may contain carrageenen to bind and or gel a system containing glycerol and or propylene glycol. Edible products are capable of being produced at quite relatively low baking temperatures, for example, 90,6 C 195 F to 93,3 C 200 F . This enables provision of an edible product which a child user may readily make with safety. Industrial, high volume production of soft textured cookies having an extended shelf life contemplated by the present invention is not taught by the patent. In US A 3,119,697, stabilized icings are prepared using an agar or modified agar gelling agent in an aqueous system. This reference does not teach or suggest how to make soft textured, baked cookie products having extended shelf life as contemplated by the present invention. U.S. Patents 3,362,831, 4,146,652, and 4,344,969 relate to imparting softness to edible food products. However, none of these three references teach or suggest the production or a firm gel which is capable of being ground for producing soft textured baked goods. U.S. Patent 3,362,831 discloses the production of artificial fruits and vegetables by contacting an aqueous sol of a water soluble alginate salt with a solution containing edible alkaline earth metal ions to form an insoluble alginate film at the interface of the two solutions. Additives, such as corn syrup sweeteners, may be incorporated in the alginate sol prior to contact with the alkaline earth metal solution. Corn syrup sweeteners, it is taught, have a significant softening effect on vegetable textures without influencing their crunchiness. U.S. Patent 4,146,652 discloses intermediate moisture foods which remain ready to use at freezer temperatures. The food products comprise about from 15 to 45 water, sugar in a ratio to water of about from 1 1 to 2 1, about from 2.5 to 30 fat, and minor, but effective amounts of salt, emulsifier, stabilizer and flavoring. The product is spoonable at about 12,2 C 10 F . Vegetable or synthetic gums are disclosed as stabilizers which improve the body and texture of toppings and as aiding in providing freeze thaw stability. Diols and polyols, such as propylene glycol and glycerol are disclosed as assisting in maintaining the foods in a bacteria , yeast , and mold free state while providing softness or plasticity to the formulations. US A 4,344,969 discloses that cookies can be formulated to be soft and moist by high shortening and or high water formulas or by the addition of fructose. See column 2, lines 35 47. The patent teaches incorporation of a carbohydrase into a cookie dough followed by a special baking process provides a cookie having a storage stable texture which is crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. GB A 1,579,324 discloses a gelled pet food of intermediate moisture content which contains sufficient water soluble preservative to reduce the water activity to a level at which the product is bacteriologically stable. Sucrose, sodium chloride, glycerine, propylene glycol and corn syrup are taught as solutes for water activity reduction. The food product also contains alginate or another alginic acid derivative which is cross linked to a gel by di or multivalent cations, such as calcium ions. The rate of release of cross linking cations is controlled by using a sparingly soluble source of calcium or by the addition of a slowly soluble acid to release calcium ions from an otherwise insoluble calcium salt. In one embodiment, a high speed mixer is used to admix a fumaric acid solution with a cooled mass of the remaining ingredients of a meat like pet food to minimize initial gel breakdown by mechanical action. The resulting mixture is then shaped or cut into strands or pieces having a meat like appearance. Use of high shear mixing of the calcium ion source or alginate to avoid the initial formation of lumps is not taught or suggested. Furthermore, production of an edible firm gel which is capable of being ground for producing soft textured baked goods is not taught or suggested by the British patent. EP A 0 072 758 discloses an edible gel composition comprising corn syrup, alginate gum, glycerine, calcium ion source and propylene glycol wherein for 100 parts by weight of the corn syrup the alginate gum content is 0,25 4 parts by weight and the calcium ion source 0 4 parts by weight. US A 4 163 805 discloses a reconstituted food comprising unsalted food mixed with water, soluble alginate binder and sugar that is shaped, contacted with a calcium ion solution and cut. The food claimed may be used as it is or further processed such as by deshydrating, frying, freezing, heat processing, marinating, enrobing, size reducing, laminating, reforming and stuffing into other products. FR A 2 462 105 discloses a process for a food product comprising a geling homogeneous mixture of alginate, salt of calcium, sugar mixed under high velocity turbine pump equipment . The present invention provides a method for preparing an edible firm gel which is capable of being ground, typically at temperatures of from about 18,3 C 65 F to about 29,4 C 85 F , which is at least substantially lump free and at least substantially homogeneous. To this end, according to the invention, the method for making an edible gel composition is characterized in that High shear mixing of the gel ingredients assures the attainment of at least a substantially lump free homogeneous gel composition in an exceptionally short period of time. The period of time for the gel composition to firm, however, is sufficiently long so as to permit its removal from mixing vessels and to permit packaging of it for shipment to bakeries and the like. The gel is ground into pieces which are sufficiently small so as to be non discernable as pieces by the consumer during consumption of the baked goods to which they impart soft eating qualities. Preferably, the edible viscous liquid is mixed to form a forced vortex, and the edible gum and edible calcium ion source are added to said edible viscous liquid. Advantageously the edible gum is added prior to addition of the edible calcium ion source and said edible gum is preblended with an edible humectant dispersing agent to form a uniform lump free blend which is mixed with said edible viscous liquid. A firm humectant gel, or dough conditioner, is obtained by admixing a an edible viscous liquid which functions primarily as a humectant, b an edible gum capable of being gelled or set by calcium ions, which is used primarily to gel the system, and c an edible calcium salt which is used to control the rate of gelling of the system. The ingredients are admixed under high shear mixing conditions which assures lump free and homogeneous gel. Mixing times needed to achieve a substantially lump free homogeneous gel are considerably shorter than those encountered with the use of conventional low shear paddle type mixers or stirrers. In the method of the present invention the edible viscous liquid is subjected to high shear mixing and the edible gum and calcium ion source are added preferably sequentially to the agitated edible viscous liquid. The mixing is continued until at least homogeneity is achieved. Clumping, or the formation of local concentrations of particulate, or powdered gums and calcium salts which tends to occur upon their contact with the edible viscous liquid is avoided or at least short lived due to agitation caused by the high shear mixing. Dispersing agents for the edible gum and or calcium ion source can be used to prolong gelation times or to enhance the humectant properties of the gel. The edible firm, elastic or rubbery gel is ground into pieces typically at temperatures of from about 18,3 C 65 F to about 29,4 C 85 F . The ground gel is incorporated into a dough using conventional mixing techniques known in the bakery art. The humectant gels of the present invention have a water activity of less than about 0.9, preferably less than about 0.7 and have a shelf stability of at least about six months in soft textured baked goods. The ground gel which is incorporated into the dough is not discernable as pieces in the baked good upon consumption. The gel composition comprises a from 0.25 parts by weight to 4.0 parts by weight, preferably from about 0.5 parts by weight to about 1.5 parts by weight of an edible gum capable of being set by calcium ions, and b from 0.1 parts by weight to 4 parts by weight, preferably from about 0.25 parts by weight to 1.0 parts by weight of a calcium ion source, said parts by weight being based upon 100 parts by weight of the edible viscous liquid. The optional edible dispersing agent for the gum can be present in an amount of up to 10 parts by weight, based upon 100 parts by weight of the edible viscous liquid. The edible dispersing agent for the calcium ion source can be used in amounts up to 10 parts by weight, based upon 100 parts by weight of the edible viscous liquid. The firm humectant gels of the present invention are used in amounts of from 2 to 50 by weight, based upon the weight of the dough for the production of soft textured baked goods. Baked goods of the present invention have soft textural stability for at least about six months. The edible viscous liquid functions primarily as a humectant. Gels produced using edible viscous liquids exhibit substantially lower water activities than do gels produced using water alone or other low viscosity liquids. The lower the water activity of the gel, the longer it can be stored for subsequent use in the production of baked goods. The water activity of the gels of the present invention are suitably less than about 0.9, preferably less than about 0.7. Anti microbial agents or anti mycotics can be included in the gel composition to increase stability. Generally, gels which have a water activity of less than about 0.7 exhibit stability for extended periods of time without the need for preservatives. Gels having water activities above about 0.7 should generally be used more rapidly after production or should contain an antimicrobial agent or anti mycotic. Baking of the dough would lower the water activity of the gel contained in it to provide gels and baked goods having a water activity of less than about 0.7. The use of edible viscous liquids having a water activity of less than or equal to 0.7 will assure the attainment of a gel which exhibits a water activity of less than or equal to 0.7 over extended periods of time when 1 stored in containers for subsequent incorporation into baked goods, and 2 when present in soft textured baked goods for periods in excess of six months. The amount of water used to produce the humectant gels of the present invention should be sufficiently high to permit the edible gum to be set by the calcium ions into a homogeneous gel. The amount of water should be low enough to a avoid gelation which is so rapid as to be incompatible with commercial scale production and b assure attainment of a firm, grindable elastic or rubbery gel. Suitable amounts of water generally range from 15 by weight to 35 by weight, based upon the total weight of the gel. The edible viscous liquids which are used in preparing the firm gels of the present invention typically have viscosities of at least 0,5 g cm s 50 centipoise at 25 C. Suitable edible viscous liquids are high fructose corn syrup, sucrose syrup, regular , high , or low dextrose corn syrups, honey, molasses, glycerine or any other type of viscous liquid or syrup as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. An edible viscous liquid can be used alone or in combination with other edible viscous liquids. A suitable mixture, for example, is a mixture of high fructose corn syrup and sucrose syrup, the amount of high fructose syrup being up to about 10 by weight of the mixture of syrups. Suitable corn syrups for use in the humectant gels of the present invention have a dextrose equivalent DE of about 36 to 71. The dextrose equivalent is defined as the percentage of reducing sugars in the syrup, calculated as dextrose, on a dry weight or dry substance basis, according to the The firm gel system of the present invention is primarily gelled by an edible gum which is capable of being gelled or set by calcium ions. Exemplary of such gums are alginate salts, such as sodium alginate, potassium alginate, and ammonium alginate, carrageenan, guar gum, locust bean gum, starch, protein, mixtures thereof, and the like. An advantage of using an edible gum such as sodium alginate is that it is set chemically by calcium ions. The reaction is not reversible chemically or by the application of heat. Suitable commercially available forms of sodium alginate include Kelcogel HV, Kelcogel LV, and Keltone Gel, each sold by Kelco Division of Merck and Company, Inc., Clark, New Jersey. The amount of edible gum, such as the sodium alginate can vary from about 0.25 to about 4 parts by weight, preferably from about 0.5 to about 1.5 parts by weight, based upon 100 parts by weight of the edible viscous liquid. When calcium alginate is used as the edible gum, an edible calcium salt is not needed to produce a gel. However, prolonged gelling times normally associated with calcium alginate can be a problem in production situations wherein delays might be experienced in waiting for the mixture to gel before stacking or storing. The gelling time should be sufficiently long so as to permit evacuation of the processing vessel in which the gel is made, and to permit packaging of the gel into suitable containers for subsequent use in a bakery. The gelling time should be sufficiently short, however, such that the gel becomes grindable into pieces within about 24 hours. Preferably, the gels should be capable of being incorporated into baked goods through an extended shelf life of about six months. The gels should accordingly be acceptably stable against bacteria and mold growth and grindable for periods preferably greater than six months. Precipitation of sugars and formation of a liquid phase may tend to occur after six months, thereby inhibiting grindability of the gel. This type of separation, while undesirable from the standpoint of grindability, occurs to such a small extent, if at all, in the baked goods so as not to impair soft textural stability and microbial stability of the baked goods for periods of at least about six months. Gelling times are primarily controlled by an edible calcium ion source. Exemplary of suitable calcium ion sources are food grade calcium salts, such as calcium sulfate dihydrate, monocalcium phosphate monohydrate, monocalcium phosphate anhydrous, calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, calcium lactate, calcium monohydrogen phosphate dicalcium orthophosphate , dicalcium orthophosphate dihydrate, tricalcium phosphate, mixtures thereof, and the like. The amount of the calcium ion source should be sufficient to obtain a firm, grindable, elastic or rubbery gel within about 24 hours, preferably within about four hours of the completion of mixing. Excessively long gelling times leads to difficulty in a assuring the attainment of a consistent product and b making any necessary formulation changes or processing adjustments to achieve consistency. Additionally, shorter gelling times permit quicker shipping of a product which can be packaged more simply than one which may be subject to spilling. Suitable amounts of the calcium ion source range from about 0.1 parts by weight to about 4 parts by weight, preferably from about 0.25 parts by weight to about 1.0 parts by weight, based upon 100 parts by weight of the edible viscous liquid. The amount is selected to provide the desired gelling time consistent with production procedures. Lower amounts of the edible calcium ion source will increase the gelling time. Increased amounts of the calcium salt will cause the mixture to set or gel more rapidly. The amount of calcium ion source which is used in the high shear mixing process of the present invention should be as low as practical so as to avoid premature gelation. Without the use of a dispersing agent for the edible gum or for the calcium ion source, the gum and calcium tend to react rapidly because they are not coated by the dispersing agent. The use of lower amounts of calcium lower the risk of lumping. Additionally, the high shear mixing breaks up any lumps which may form. Generally, the higher the amount of the edible gum, the lower the amount of calcium ion source needed to set the gel into the firm, grindable, rubbery mass within a given period of time. Generally, weight ratios of sodium alginate edible calcium ion source in the range of about 1 to about 3 have been found to provide firm, grindable, elastic or rubbery gels within acceptable commercial scale processing times of less than about 24 hours. At sodium alginate to calcium ion source weight ratios above about 3, the compositions tend to possess a jam type or pastry filler type spreadable consistency over prolonged periods of time. The rate of gelation may also be controlled by the use of known edible pH adjusters, such as buffering systems, organic acids, acidic salts and alkaline salts. The pH controllers inhibit or promote reaction between the calcium ion source and the edible gum by controlling the solubility of the calcium ion source in the edible viscous liquid. Generally, lowering the pH increases the solubility of the calcium ion source which promotes its reaction with the edible gum. Increasing the pH generally decreases the solubility of the calcium ion source or sequesters the calcium ion which inhibits reaction with the edible gum. Exemplary of suitable alkaline salts are sodium citrate, sodium acetate, and sodium ascorbate. A suitable acidic salt is sodium acid pyrophosphate. Suitable organic acids include citric acid, acetic acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, ascorbic acid, and the like. Exemplary of suitable buffering systems are sodium citrate and citric acid, sodium acetate and acetic acid, and sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid. Before addition to the edible viscous liquid, the pH adjuster is preferably dissolved in an amount of water and or in an amount of the edible viscous liquid which is sufficient to form a solution. The amount of organic acid, acidic salt, or buffering system added is generally sufficient to provide a pH of about 3.5 to about 7.5, preferably about 4.5 to about 6.5 to increase the solubility of the calcium ion source subsequently added. Higher pH values, obtained with an appropriate amount of an alkaline salt, are generally used to impede the reaction between the calcium ion source and the edible gum. The pH adjuster is thoroughly dispersed in the edible viscous liquid, followed by dispersion of the edible gum and then the calcium ion source. When an alkaline salt is used to inhibit the reaction between the calcium ion and the edible gum, it can be subsequently promoted by the addition of an edible organic acid, a buffer system or an acidic salt. The subsequently added acidic agent is preferably added in an amount of water and or edible viscous liquid sufficient to solubilize it. The amount of acidic agent should again generally be sufficient to provide a pH of about 3.5 to about 7.5, preferably about 4.5 to about 6.5. Upon its addition, mixing is continued to obtain a substantially homogeneous mixture. While pH adjusters can be used in the practice of the present invention, they are not preferred because they unnecessarily complicate commercial scale operations. Another method for avoiding the formation of lumps upon the addition of either the calcium ion source or an edible gum which may have a relatively high calcium ion content is by the use of dispersing agents as disclosed in applicants parent application U.S. Serial No. 293,924. The dispersing agent can be for the edible gum and or for the edible calcium ion source. Commercially available edible gums, such as sodium alginate, may inherently contain calcium ions. When added in powdered form to an edible viscous liquid, such as corn syrup, lumps tend to form which are difficult to disperse. These lumps are believed to be caused by skin formation due to reaction of the calcium ions with the sodium alginate and the water present in the edible viscous liquid. Once this skin is formed, subsequent reaction between the interior, unreacted sodium alginate and the subsequently added calcium ion source can require prolonged mixing times under low shear mixing conditions. By first dispersing the edible gum in a dispersing agent and then admixing the dispersion with the edible viscous liquid, as disclosed in said parent application U.S. Serial No. 293,924, the edible gum can be dispersed throughout the edible viscous liquid without forming lumps due to reaction with the water. Likewise, the addition of the calcium ion source to the mixture of the edible viscous liquid and the edible gum tends to form lumps due to skin formation around the calcium ion source. This lumping is avoided by dispersing the calcium ion source in the dispersing agent which impedes reaction between the calcium ion source and the edible gum so as to permit its dispersion throughout the system in a manner which avoids lumping. Under low shear mixing conditions, the edible dispersing agent for the gum, e.g., glycerine, can range from about 2 to about 7 or more parts by weight, based upon 100 parts by weight of the edible viscous liquid. It is used in an amount sufficient to disperse the gum in the viscous liquid. Lower amounts than about 2 might be capable of dispersing the gum. However, about 2 parts by weight have been generally found to be necessary for the dispersal. Once dispersed, additional amounts of the glycerine or other component can be used even though not necessary for dispersing the gum. Also, the amount of edible dispersing agent for the calcium salt should be sufficient to slurry the calcium salt and can vary from about 0.5 to about 3 parts by weight, based upon 100 parts by weight of the edible viscous liquid. The dispersing agent for the edible gum and the dispersing agent for the calcium ion source may be the same or different. The dispersing agent may be any edible liquid or edible solid that would not interact, or only interact very slowly with the other ingredients and still have the ability to disperse the edible gum and or calcium ion source into the system. Exemplary of suitable liquid humectant dispersing agents are glycerine, sorbitol solutions, propylene glycol, and mixtures thereof. Exemplary of suitable solid humectant dispersing agents are crystalline sorbitol, sugar, and milk powder. The edible dispersing agents may be used to adjust the water activity of the gel composition to values less than about 0.7. The edible dispersing agents may also be used to enhance the humectancy of the gels. Under high shear mixing conditions, a dispersing agent for the edible gum or for the edible calcium ion source is not needed to at least substantially avoid lumps in the final gelled product. Lump formation is minimized under high shear mixing conditions because of high fluid velocities across the entire surface of the edible viscous liquid and because of rapid agitation throughout substantially the entire mass of the edible viscous liquid. The dispersing agents may be used to delay or retard gelation times and or for their affect on water activity and humectancy of the gel. Suitable amounts of the dispersing agent for the edible gum range up to about 10 parts by weight based upon the weight of the edible viscous liquid. Suitable amounts of the dispersing agent for the edible calcium ion source range up to about 10 parts by weight based upon 100 parts by weight of the edible viscous liquid. The total amount of humectant dispersing agent or agents is suitably less than about 20 parts by weight based upon 100 parts by weight of the edible viscous liquid. Higher amounts tend to increase costs excessively, or may impart undesirable tastes to the baked good. The optional antimicrobial agents or anti mycotics which can be included in the gels of the present invention are those known in the food art. Exemplary of suitable preservatives are sodium benzoate, benzoic acid, sorbic acid, calcium propionate, sodium propionate, potassium sorbate, calcium sorbate, and mixtures thereof. The preservatives can be used in effective amounts which do not adversely affect taste or smell of the final baked product or gellation rates. Suitable amounts range from about 0.0025 to about 0.30 by weight, based upon the weight of the gel composition. The optional preservative may be incorporated into the gel composition by adding it alone to the edible viscous liquid or as a premix with any of the other gel ingredients so as to distribute it substantially uniformly throughout the gel composition. The firm gels of the present invention may include flavoring ingredients. However, they would tend to be released more slowly upon consumption. Incorporation of flavoring ingredients directly into the dough would provide for conventional flavor and textural impact. Additionally, incorporation of flavoring or other materials into the gel would unnecessarily increase the volume of the gelled ingredients in the baked goods and unnecessarily complicate the production of the firm gels. Accordingly, the firm gels of the present invention preferably only contain the edible viscous liquid, the edible gum, the calcium ion source, and the optional edible humectant dispersing agent or agents. The firm gel composition is very easily prepared by first blending, either by low or high shear mixing, the edible gum with the optional humectant, dispersing agent for the gum to a thick, syrup like, lump free consistency. The resulting substantially uniform blend is then mixed into the edible viscous syrup, under high shear mixing conditions, for sufficient time to provide a lump free, uniform blend. Typical high shear mixing times to obtain the uniform, lump free blend range from about 1 minute to about 3 minutes. The edible calcium salt and the optional edible humectant, dispersing agent for the calcium salt are blended either by low shear or high shear mixing to form a pourable, lump free slurry or blend. The resulting substantially uniform slurry or blend is mixed into the blend of the viscous liquid, gum, and gum dispersing agent, under high shear mixing conditions until a uniform, lump free dispersion is obtained. Typical mixing times to obtain a uniform, lump free dispersion typically range from about 1 to about 3 minutes. The addition of all components should preferably be performed while the edible viscous liquid is subjected to high shear mixing. This reduces processing times and further assures both the substantial avoidance of lump formation upon contact of the component with the edible viscous liquid, and the attainment of a consistent product from batch to batch. In preparing gel compositions without a dispersing agent for the edible gum or for the calcium ion source, the edible viscous liquid is preferably first subjected to high shear mixing, and the edible gum and the edible calcium ion source are preferably sequentially added to the agitated edible viscous liquid. Addition of the edible gum prior to addition of the calcium ion source is preferred for avoidance of rapid, localized gelation of the gum. Dry or powdered edible gums and edible calcium ion sources can be preblended prior to addition to the edible viscous liquid. However, more consistent products are obtained from batch to batch when sequential addition is used. Each component, upon addition, is admixed with the other components for a period of time sufficient to achieve a substantially homogeneous, lump free mixture. Typical mixing times range from about 1 to 3 minutes for each component added. External heating or cooling is not needed in preparing the gel compositions of the present invention. Conveniently Suitable low shear mixers which can be used for preblending of ingredients, such as the edible calcium ion source and the dispersing agent for it, include Hobart mixers, Sigma Blade mixers, Ribbon mixers, Nauta mixers, and Littleford mixers. The high shear mixer should be capable of imparting the needed energy to at least substantially avoid the initial formation of lumps due to skin formation or premature gelling by intense rapid dispersion of the components into the edible viscous liquid. Suitable high shear mixing devices are those which can subject at least two thirds, preferably at least substantially all of the gel ingredients, to a forced vortex. In a forced vortex, the surfaces of constant pressure are paraboloids of revolution. Suitable high shear mixing equipment which can be used in the present invention are Waring blenders, Norman mixers, a Breddo Likwifier, manufactured by Breddo Food Products Corporation, Kansas City, Kansas, and vessels equipped with high speed impellers. After mixing of all of the components is completed, the resulting mixture is poured into containers which are then sealed and the mixture is allowed to set. After it has set the containers can be stacked and stored or shipped. At some later point the firm gel can be used in the preparation of a cookie or cake dough or batter. The firm gels are capable of being ground into rubbery elastic pieces typically in about 12 to 24 hours after the completion of the high shear mixing. The firm gels are grindable into pieces at ambient bakery conditions which typically are about 18,3 C 65 F to about 29,4 C 85 F . They remain grindable into rubbery, elastic pieces for periods of up to at least about six months. Grinding of the firm gels of the present invention shortly before incorporation into a baked good dough avoids coagulation between the pieces. Fre ground gels tend to form a solid mass under normal shipping and storage conditions. Suitable grinders for grinding of the firm gels of the present invention into rubbery, elastic pieces include low shear grinding equipment such as Hobart grinders, a food chopper, and the like. Grinding of the gel into pices facilitates incorporation of the gel into the baked good dough. The pieces to which the gel is ground should be of sufficient fineness to permit their dispersion or incorporation into the dough substantially uniformly using conventional dough mixing equipment. The firm grindable gels may be incorporated into the dough without pre grinding. However, longer mixing times would be needed to disperse the firm gel substantially uniformly throughout the dough. The firm gels are suitably ground into pieces having a maximum dimension of about 1,59 mm 1 16 to about 3,18 mm 1 8 or less prior to incorporation into the dough. Additional size reduction generally occurs upon incorporation of the pieces into the dough. The pieces should be of sufficiently small size and sufficient elasticity so as to be non discernible upon consumption of the baked good. A typical dough for making soft cookies, snacks and cakes can contain flour, granulated sugar and or at least one syrup sweetener such as corn syrup, invert syrup, high fructose corn syrup, sucrose syrup, honey or molasses, shortening, leavening agent such as baking powder, and water. The flour may be wheat, oat, rice, potato, corn flour, mixtures thereof, and the like. Wheat is generally the preferred flour. The amounts of these ingredients can vary over a very wide range depending upon the end product desired and the particular processing steps to be utilized. Based on 45,4 kg 100 pounds of flour, the amount of sweetener, e.g., sugar, corn syrup, invert syrup, high fructose corn syrup, sucrose syrup, honey, molasses, or mixtures thereof can vary from 11,3 kg 25 pounds to 68 kg 150 pounds depending upon the sweetness desired in the final product. In the sweetener composition, the granulated sugar can vary from zero to 68 kg 150 pounds and the corn syrup, invert syrup, high fructose corn syrup, sucrose syrup, molasses or honey can vary from zero to 68 kg 150 pounds . The amount of shortening can be varied from zero, preferably from about 9,07 kg 20 pounds to about 36,3 kg 80 pounds per 45,4 kg 100 pounds of flour. The amount of leavening agent, such as baking powder, present can vary from none up to about 2,27 kg 5 pounds per 45,4 kg 100 pounds of flour. When no baking powder is used, air can be whipped into the dough or batter during creaming. Water can be added up to the desired amount keeping in mind that the flour normally contains about 12 14 by weight moisture, the invert syrup or high fructose syrup contains about 18 or more weight percent water and the firm gel typically contains about 15 to about 35 by weight water. Considering all sources including separately added water, the moisture content of the dough composition can range from 20 to 60 by weight. Sufficient water should be present to provide the desired consistency to the dough to enable proper working and shaping of the dough. The doughs of the present invention contain from about 2 by weight to about 50 by weight of the firm gel composition, based upon the weight of the dough. Depending upon the type of soft cookie or snack desired, the formulation could, of course, contain cocoa, chocolate, chocolate chips, oats, peanut butter, eggs, milk, raisins, nuts, artificial and or natural flavoring or a variety of other ingredients normally used in the making of cookies or cakes, all in accordance with techniques well known in the art. Preblending the firm gel with the sugar and or the at least one syrup sweetener enhances or facilitates its dispersion throughout the dough. It also at least substantially avoids the formation of undesirable lumps of gel in the dough. When granulated sugar is employed the firm gel can be mixed with the granulated sugar until the firm gel forms beadlets. A low shear mixer, such as a Hobart mixer, can be used to form the beadlets. Alternatively, the firm gel can be ground, in a food chopper for example, and then blended with the granulated sugar. When granulated sugar is not employed, the firm gel is preferably ground prior to blending with the at least one syrup sweetener. The ground gel can be mixed directly with the at least one syrup, such as invert syrup, and or high fructose corn syrup, the shortening, and the water. When both granulated sugar and at least one syrup sweetener are used, it is preferable to pre blend the firm gel with the granulated sugar and then combine the pre blend with the at least one syrup sweetener, the shortening, and the water. In the event no invert syrup or other sweetening syrup is used, the firm gel is mixed with the granulated sugar to disperse it on the sugar in the form of beadlets and the resulting blend is mixed with the shortening and water. After combining the firm gel, the at least one sweetener, the shortening, and the water, mixing is continued until a smooth consistency is obtained. Thereafter, the flour and leavening agent, such as baking powder, are added to the creamed mixture and mixing is continued to form a smooth dough. The dough is cut or otherwise shaped into the form and size of cookie or snack desired in a conventional manner and then is baked by conventional procedures. Baking temperatures of about 162,8 C 325 F to about 232,2 C 450 F can be used. The higher temperatures will require less time for baking a given form of dough. For example, for cookies the time can be as low as six minutes and for cakes about eighteen or twenty minutes might be needed. The times and temperatures are conventional and the skilled baker can utilise any suitable times and temperatures consistent with good baking practices. The final baked product preferably has a water activity of less than about 0.7 to assure the attainment of microbial stability for periods of at least six months under non refrigerated conditions. The doughs may be used to produce soft textured drop cookies, sandwich type cookies, filled cookies, and the like, or multiple textured cookies of extended shelf life. The latter type of cookies can be produced by enrobing one dough with another dough, the two doughs having substantially different amounts of gel. The outer dough may be a conventional crispy cookie dough without any of the firm gel of the present invention. As employed in the context of the present invention, the term chewy is intended to define textures which possess a discernible degree of plasticity. Chewiness also connotes impressions of softness and moistness. Crispness and chewiness can be described in terms of taste panel tests which take as standards the texture of fresh saltine crackers having a moisture content of about 2 rating of 0 and a freshly baked cookie having a distinctly chewy texture throughout rating of 10 i.e., chewy cookies prepared in accordance with the following recipe The cookies are prepared by combining 2 3 cup of sugar, butter, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, salt and vanilla in a large mixing bowl and creaming the ingredients until they are light and fluffy. Next the eggs are added and beat in until the mixture is very fluffy. The honey is then blended in, followed by the blending in of the flour a little at a time. The dough is dropped by teaspoonfuls 6,35 cm 2 1 2 inches apart onto a lightly greased baking sheet, baked at 176,7 C 350 F for 10 to 15 minutes until lightly browned and removed at once from the baking sheet to racks to cool thoroughly. Employing the rating scale described above, the chewy portion of the product of this invention preferably has a rating of at least 3 and most preferably at least 5. The crispy portion preferably has a rating of less than 5 and most preferably less than 2. The regions should show a difference in ratings of at least 2 units, and most preferably at least 5 units. A suitable crispy cookie dough comprises, based upon 45,4 kg 100 pounds of flour a from about 11,3 kg 25 pounds to about 68 kg 150 pounds of granulated sugar, b from 0, preferably from about 9,07 kg 20 pounds to about 36,3 kg 80 pounds shortening, and c from 0 up to about 2,27 kg 5 pounds of a leavening agent such as sodium bicarbonate. The crispy dough should also contain water in an amount sufficient to provide desired consistency to the dough and to enable proper working and shaping. Conventional cookie flavoring and texturizing ingredients can be included in conventional amounts and in known manner. The present invention is further illustrated in the following examples, where all parts, ratios, and percentages are by weight, and all temperatures are in C F , unless otherwise stated The corn syrup is added to a Norman high shear mixer at approximately 21,1 C 70 F . The sodium alginate gum and glycerine are pre mixed in a Hobart mixer to a thick, syrup like, lump free consistency. The calcium sulfate dihydrate and propylene glycol are also pre mixed or blended to a pourable, lump free slurry in a Hobart mixer. The corn syrup is subjected to high shear mixing and the alginate glycerine blend is then added to, and mixed with, the corn syrup in the mixer for about 2 minutes. The calcium sulfate slurry is then added to the agitated corn syrup and mixing is continued for about 1 more minute. During the high shear mixing, the vortex extends to a depth so as to make the mixing blade at the bottom of the vessel visible. Upon completion of the mixing, the contents of the vessel are poured directly into plastic lined shippers or containers which are properly sealed whereupon the mixture is allowed to gel and set. The gelled mixtures in the containers are then stacked and stored or shipped. The firm gel can be used thereafter in a baking step for making soft textured cookies described hereinafter or held for some time and then distributed to the baking location or baking plant. The firm gel system is dispersed on the granulated sugar and mixed until the firm gel is in the form of beadlets approximately 0,79 mm 1 32 diameter . Then, to the above, are added, with mixing, the high fructose corn syrup, the shortening and water and mixing is continued until a smooth consistency is obtained. Then, the flour and baking powder are added to the above and mixed to form a smooth dough. The dough is cut or otherwise formed into the size cookie or snack desired and then baked at a temperature ranging from about 162,8 C 325 F to about 232,2 C 450 F for about 6 minutes to about 18 or 20 minutes. The cookies resulting from the formulation, mixing procedure and baking have an extended shelf life of at least 6 months while retaining a moist and soft texture.
