# Integral memory circuit with a single pulse train timing control.

## Abstract
An integral memory circuit includes a matrix of storage elements 11 , and time controlled addressing and output elements 12, 13, 14, 17, 31 DÃ˜ to D17, 31 . Each output element includes a latch 100 and an output line 100 driving an external driver 26 . Each output serves a set of storage elements connected to a node 24 to which the output line and latch are connected in parallel. All the time controlled elements are controlled by a single pulse train which enables the latch to hold the output line state when all other time controlled elements are disabled or reset and disables the latch when the other elements are selectively enabled thus eliminating any latch induced output delay.
