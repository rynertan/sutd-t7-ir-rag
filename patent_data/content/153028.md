# A MIRROR WAFER OF COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTOR

## Abstract
Compound semiconductors belonging to groups III V have a crystalline structure of the zinc blende type. Wafers sliced from a single crystal ingot on 100 planes have four cleavage planes. Two parallel cleavage planes are equivalent. But two cleavage planes perpendicular with each other are unequiva lent. The etching speeds on the unequivalent cleavage planes are different from some pertinent etchant. A difference of the mesa direction and the reverse mesa di rection along unequivalent cleavage planes exists in compound semiconductors unlike silicon semiconductor. By etching process using a pertinent etchant natural aniso tropic patterns appear on the rear side on a wafer to denote the mesa direction on the front surface by nature. Natural pat terns have generally elongate shapes parallel with each other, resembling lines or ellipsoids. The direction of the longer side is the mesa direction on the front surface. Otherwise artificial parallel patterns can be formed on the rear surface to denote the mesa direction by photoetching process using photoresist and a mask with anisotropic pattern. This invention is especial ly useful for rectangular or square wafers which have not orien tation flats on the peripheries.
