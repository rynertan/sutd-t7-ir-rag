# Photo deposition of metals onto substrates.

## Abstract
A method for depositing a refractory metal onto a substrate wherein a carbonyl compound vapour of the metal in the vicinity of or on the substrate is photodecomposed by ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths less than 200 nm. This causes the release of atoms of the metal, which then condense onto the substrate. In an example, a tungsten layer is photodeposited by this method onto a GaAs semiconduc tor layer to form a Shottky barrier diode.
