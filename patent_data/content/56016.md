# Flexible containers.

## Abstract
A flexible container 1 for the storage of liquids which incorporates a resealable opening. A flap 5 is temporarily sealed over the opening 7 of the unfilled flexible container. When the container is filled this temporary seal 13 is broken and after filling a permanent heat seal 15 is formed by applying heat externally to the flexible container. The flap is heat sealable on the surface contacting the opening in the container wall but non heat sealable on its opposite surface. The temporary seal is preferably a heat activated or pressure sensitive coating which has a low cohesion with the opening of the flexible container wall.
