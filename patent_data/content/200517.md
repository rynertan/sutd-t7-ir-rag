# Electrical connector assembly.

## Abstract
A partially pre assembled electrical connector has metal terminals 110 partially inserted in a housing 100 . Appar atus is provided for completing the assembly of the connec tors by at least partially withdrawing each terminal from the housing, placing the end of a wire 180 in the exposed portion of the terminal, crimping the terminal on the wire, and then fully inserting the terminal in the housing. The method may be performed as a continuous process acting on successive terminals in a housing.
