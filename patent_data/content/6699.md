# COAL LIQUEFACTION PROCESS EMPLOYING MULTIPLE RECYCLE STREAMS

## Abstract
In a coupled coal solvent liquefaction gasification sy stem wherein a recycle mineral residue containing slurry 58 is mixed with the raw coal feed slurry 12 for the li quefaction zone 22, 26 , the resulting feed slurry 16 is under a pumpability total solids level constraint. Where a coupled stem is operating under such a total solids level constraint for the feed slurry, any increase in the mineral residue recycle rate 58 relative to the coal feed rate 10 advantageously provides a catalytic activity and selectivity advantage in favor of liquid coal product at the expense of higher and lower boiling products. It is shown herein that this activity and selectivity effect is enhanced with decreas ing liquefaction zone residence times. In accordance with the present invention, the ratio of recycle mineral residue 58 to feed coal 10 is enhanced by recycling a second mineral residue containing slurry 130 to the liquefaction zone 26 independently of the raw coal feed slurry 16 . The amount of solids in the second recycle slurry 130 can be established to compensate for a progressive reduc tion in solids level in the process slurry due to the dissol ving of feed coal so that the process slurry continues to maintain the maximum total solids constraint in spite of progressive coal solvation.
