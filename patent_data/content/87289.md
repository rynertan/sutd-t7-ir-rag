# SHACKLE

## Abstract
A snap closing shackle has a catch 10 which moves in a straight line motion to release a latch 20 . The catch is guided by its stem 8 running in a bearing orifice 7 in the body of the shackle. The catch may be operated by a trigger like extension 11 available through a window 6 in the body of a shackle and or by a lanyard attached to an extension 17 of the stem. The axle 21 of the latch arm 20 is offset from the centre line 22 of the shackle, and the foot of the latch is made with a planar sole 25 and an upwardly inclined surface 24 which abuts and wedges against an abutment surface 28 fast with the body of the shackle.
