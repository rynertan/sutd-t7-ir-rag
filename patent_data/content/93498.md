# Pharmaceutical compositions containing N substituted 3 hydroxypyrid 2 one or 4 one derivatives.

## Abstract
Pharmaceutical compositions containing a 3 hydroxy pyrid 2 one or 3 hydroxypyrid 4 one in which the hydrogen atom attached to the nitrogen atom is replaced by an aliphatic hydrocarbon group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms and, optionally, in which one or more of the hydrogen atoms attached to ring carbon atoms are replaced by an aliphatic hydrocarbon group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or a salt thereof containing a physiologically acceptable cation, are of value for removing toxic amounts of metals, particularly iron, from the body.
