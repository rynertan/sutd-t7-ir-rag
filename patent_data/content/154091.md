# Spray guns for spraying liquids.

## Abstract
A pistol grip spray gun has a handle 12 , an actuating member 30 movable with respect to the handle in the manner of a trigger, a barrel 14 with an outlet for delivering a spray of the liquid, the actuating member being movable from a closed position thereof, corresponding to a closed condition of the nozzle 51 , through a range of open positions with differing spray characteristics, retaining means 36, 40 for retaining the actuating member in a selected position in the range of open positions, and release means 42,44 for releasing the retaining means to allow the actuating member to return to or towards its closed position. In this way, the spray characteristics of the gun can be varied, and retained in any chosen characteristic, by control of the trigger without the necessity of a separate adjustment at the nozzle.
