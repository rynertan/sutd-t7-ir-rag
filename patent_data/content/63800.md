# Keyboard apparatus.

## Abstract
A capacitance keyboard matrix screening and grounding arrangement and method are disclosed in which scanning drive means 14 to 18 and scanning sense means 20 to 27 sequentially address drive 11 and sense conductors 12 in drive and sense conductor arrays respectively and maintain a reference potential on all conductors except for individual conductors while they are being addressed. The scanning drive and sense means are implemented with demultiplexers 14, 24 whose output terminals are each connected to a drive 11 or sense conductor 12 through an inverter 18, 25 .
