# HINGED ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR

## Abstract
An electrical connector comprises first and second dielectric housings 10, 11 each having cavities in which male and female electrical contacts 12, 13 are respectively secured, the male electrical contacts 12 have male contact portions 12d extending outwardly from the first housing 10 and are disposed in respective female contact portions 13b of the female electrical contacts 13 , hinge sections 18, 19, 26, 28 on the first and second housings 10, 11 hingedly connecting the housings 10, 11 together so that when the male and female electrical contacts 12, 13 are connected to respective printed circuit boards 33, 34 , the boards 33, 34 can be moved from a position at which the boards 33, 34 are at right angles to a position at which the boards 33, 34 are substantially coplanar.
