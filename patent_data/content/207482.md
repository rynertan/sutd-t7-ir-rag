## Description
In order to avoid the formation of splintering or other irregularities during the cutting, by means of a circular blade, of panels or stacks of panels made either of wood or derivatives thereof, especially if veneered with a laminate or decorative paper, presently there is provided in advance of the circular saw, at least one scoring or grooving member which forms, on the surface of the panel wherefrom the teeth of the saw will exit and therefore would urge said surface outwards with resulting splintering, an aligned groove of such dimensions whereby the saw teeth will exit in a region of material which is defined at its sides by the edges of the incision groove, which avoids the formation of said irregularities. The direction of rotation of said scoring or grooving member is such as to compress the material of the panel inwards. In case of particularly delicate material, e.g. when cutting panels coated with synthetic material and to be used for constituting kitchen furniture, said panels being defined by particularly contoured edges, a second scoring member is often used and is especially designed to operate on the edge or side of the panel which would be urged outwards by the teeth of the circular saw. The use of said scoring member requires precision working and creates setup problems. When these tools are to be sharpened or replaced, and then are to be set in line, such an operation must be performed by highly skilled personnel and is extremely time consuming. From DE A 1 813 785 and to DE A 2 636 529 it is known a method of cutting panels, in which a single circular saw blade cuts a panel in two strokes, by cutting through a part of its thickness during its forward stroke and through the remaining part of its thickness during its return stroke. The axis of rotation of the saw is at all times maintained on one side, i.e. below or above said panel, and the direction of rotation of the saw and the inclination of its teeth are such that the two faces of the panel which are successively acted upon during the two strokes of said saw are compressed inwardly of said panel, thereby avoiding splintering or other irregularities at the sides of the cut. The present invention relates to a method in accordance with the above mentioned prior art, which in addition presents the feature that, prior to moving the saw horizontally to effect the first cut, the said saw is moved horizontally and vertically with precision to effect at least one incision on the side of the panel facing a rest station of said saw, said incisions being made so as to subject said side to compression inward of the panel thereby avoiding splintering during entry and exit of said saw while being displaced horizontally to effect said superposed cuts. Other characterizing features of the method of the invention are apparent from the dependent claims 2 to 4, while claim 5 is directed to a cutting machine for carrying out the method in accordance with the invention. In the drawings Figure 1 is a diagrammatic side elevational view of the cutting saw during the main movements effected upon each cutting cycle Figures 2 and 3 show the working steps of the saw on panels having rounded edges or sides Figure 4 shows the working steps of the saw on a panel or stack of panels having planar and vertical edges Figures 5 and 6 are diagrammatic side elevational and top plan views, respectively, of the saw supporting carriage of an improved sawing machine according to the invention. With reference to Figure 1, P indicates a panel or stack of panels as seen across the thickness thereof. In the case of Figure 1, the panel P rests on a horizontal working table L, is clamped upstream and downstream of the cutting line by suitable conventional means, not shown here, and is cut by means of a circular saw S having its axis of rotation below said table L and located, when at rest, on the right side of said panel. The cutting of the panel P is effected by the circular saw S alone, which has a radius larger than the thickness of said panel P and has teeth so inclined as to compress the material of the lower surface FI of said panel P inwards of said panel when the saw is rotated in the direction of the arrow F and is moved with a leftward translatory displacement as seen in Figure 1. According to the invention, the saw S is mounted on its horizontal displacement carriage and can be displaced vertically and with precision, for example, through digital control means. The saw S will cut the panel P, not thoroughly during its displacement from the right hand position leftwards but conversely it will cut the panel during two strokes, namely forwards and backwards. While moving leftwards, the saw will cut, as seen at T1, a portion of the thickness of the panel P, and while moving in the reverse rightward stroke the same saw will cut the remaining portion of the same panel, as seen at T2. More particularly, while moving leftwards the saw S will cut into the lower portion of the thickness of the panel P whereby to affect the lower surface FI of said panel, whereas in the reverse rightward stroke said saw will cut into the remaining portion of P whereby to affect also the upper surface FS thereof. In Figure 1 it is apparent that while moving leftwards in the example considered here , the saw S operates on the lower surface FI of the panel P with the section of teeth comprised between the 9 o clock and 12 o clock positions, and assuming the saw rotates in the direction F, it appears clearly that the material being cut thereby is submitted to compression inwards of the panel so that the resulting cut will be free from splintering. In the reverse rightward stroke, the direction of rotation F being unchanged, the saw S operates on the upper surface FS of P with the section of teeth comprised between the 12 o clock and the 3 o clock positions and submits the material being cut thereby to compression inwards of the panel, again avoiding any splintering. In order to obtain a neat cutting, if the material to be cut is formed by a stack of panels, the thickness of the material affected by the first cut T1 is other than the thickness or a multiple of the thickness of a single panel, so that the border between two cuts T1 and T2 will not be at two adjacent faces of two panels. Usually, when the saw S has completed its leftward stroke and has effected the cut T1, said saw shall get out entirely of the plan view outline of the material P before rising up to the level required to effect the cut T2. By operating according to the method described with reference to Figure 1, some drawbacks may arise at the right hand side of the panel P, where the cutting cycle is initiated and terminated, since said side would not be submitted to an inward compression by the teeth of the saw S at the beginning and at the end of the strokes effecting the cuts T1, T2. Said drawbacks may be obviated by effecting, at said side of the panel P and before the saw S begins its working cycle, one or more incisions thanks to an accurate displacement of said saw either horizontally and vertically see below . The side of the panel P intended to receive said incision s is positioned against a fixed stop A, so that it can be easily and accurately located. Thereafter, said side of the panel is released by the pressor which had clamped it on the working table L. Some exemplary embodiments of said incisions will be now illustrated as non limitating examples to carry out said incisions in the most usual operative situations. It will be seen in Figure 2 that if the edges of the panel P are of rounded shape, the saw S is first risen up to bring its axis in the position shown at 1 so that it cannot interfere with the panel, and whereafter said saw is translated horizontally toward the panel P as far as to bring its axis to the position 2 to carry out the incision N1. Thereafter, said saw is moved back horizontally from the position 2 to the position 3, whereafter it is lowered to the position 4 to carry out the incision N2. From the position 4, the saw is moved horizontally leftwards to carry out the cut T1. From the position 5, said saw is risen up to the position 6 and then moved horizontally rightwards to carry out the cut T2. From the position 7, at which the cycle is completed, the saw S is lowered to the rest position to be ready for a new working cycle. It is apparent that said incisions N1 and N2 are carried out with a compression of the material inwards of the panel, and it is apparent as well that, by virtue of said incisions, said horizontal translatory movement of the saw upon beginning and terminating the cutting cycle will not cause any splintering on the right hand side or edge of the panel P. The operative movements of the saw S when a panel P has partly rounded edges as shown in Figure 3 are similar to those described with reference to Figure 2. N1 and N2 indicate the two incisions or scores effected as described above. If the material to be cut P has flat and vertical edges as shown in Figure 4, there may be effected a single incision or score N3 such as to cover the right hand side symmetrically. For this purpose, the saw is displaced to bring its axis either to the position shown at 1, corresponding to the ideal horizontal plane midway of the thickness of the panel P, or to a position wherein said axis is below said plane, whereafter it is moved horizontally to the position 2 and then back to the position 1 and then lowered to the level which is required to effect the cut T1, or it may be lowered directly to said level with no previous reverse movement because, just as in the execution of said scores N2 in the examples of Figures 2 and 3, the material being scored would be submitted to compression inwardly of the panels by the teeth of the saw S. It is to be understood that in case of different configurations of the edges of the panels, said incisions or scores may be different from those described above both qualitatively and quantitatively. It is also to be understood that, with suitable and conceivable modifications, the invention described above is to be protected as well if the saw S is usually positioned at the left hand side of the panel P, or if the axis of rotation of the saw is located above the panel P to be cut. A possible embodiment of the carriage supporting the saw S movably as described above will be described with reference to Figures 5 and 6. It can be seen in these Figures that the saw S is rotatably supported, through its shaft, by the ends of a horizontal arm 10 the opposite end of which is fixed in a cantilever fashion to the top end 111 of a mounting structure 11, the arrangement being such that said saw S can act on the material to be cut, either with its upper portion or with the entire front portion, which is necessary to effect said incisions N1, N2, N3. It can be seen in Figure 6 that said arm 10 is connected to said structure 11 in a vertically adjustable manner by means of a guide slide unit 12 through the intermediary of a cradle 13 permitting the adjustment of the saw by a virtual rotation about a vertical axis which is co incident with the axis of said saw S. The numeral 211 indicates rectilinear rods fixed to said structure 11 and slidable with accuracy in vertical guides 14 which are secured to a structure 15 which effects the required horizontal movements of the saw supporting carriage through precision control means of conventional construction, such as pinion and rack means not shown . The means for moving the saw S horizontally and vertically will not be illustrated since it is easily conceivable and constructible by those skilled in the art. As stated above, the saw S is to be displaced with precision either vertically and horizontally. On the structure 15 there may be easily arranged precision means, for example digital control means, to provide for the vertical displacement of the structure 11. It is to be understood that the description has been made with reference to some preferred embodiments of the invention, and that many changes and modifications may be made thereto, especially of constructional nature, without departing from the invention as claimed hereinafter.
