# Magnetic eraser dust collector.

## Abstract
A device for use with an eraser of a rubber composition having magnetic particles dispersed therein. The device has a permanent magnet 34 forattracting the magnetic dust 46 created by use of the eraser 32. For the ready removal of the collected dust 46 the device further comprises a shield 36 normally enclosing the magnet 34. When held close to or in direct contact with a dust collecting wall 40 forming a part of the shield 36 the magnet 34 attracts eraser dust 46 there through. The eraser dust attached to the dust collecting wall 40 can be readily released, as into a suitable receptacle such as a trash can, as the magnet 34 is moved away from the dust collecting wall 40 as by being pulled out of the shield 36. The device may incorporate a magnetic eraser 32 to provide a convenient eraser dust collector combination 30, as in some embodiments disclosed herein. Additional embodiments suggest the combined use of a brush 60 for collecting eraser dust, and the provision of an open space 56 for confining the collected dust on the dust collecting wall of the shield.
