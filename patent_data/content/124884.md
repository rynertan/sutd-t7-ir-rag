# FRONT ACTIVATED FUZE

## Abstract
The invention relates to a fuze, particularly an Inpact Delay fuze for a bomb. The fuze has an activating mechanism which includes a striker which is retained against a spring bias. When released by a pulled lanyard the striker is forced, by the bias spring, to activate the fuze. In order that a fuze having a rear activating mechanism may be released by a pull from the front, the activating mechanism includes a motion reversing coupling to reverse the direction of the pull.
