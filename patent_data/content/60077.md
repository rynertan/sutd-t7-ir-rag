This reaction may be performed in any solvent that is substantially inert during the reaction, for example tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, dioxan, hexamethyl phosphoramide, dimethoxyethane or dimethoxy diethyl ether. Of these solvents dimethylformamide is preferred. Alternatively we have found it useful to use a phase transfer catalyst. Particularly suitable phase transfer catalysts include tetra n butyl ammonium bromide, cetylbromide and cetyltriethylammonium chloride suitable solvents include halogenated water immiscible solvents such as chloroform in the presence of water.The reaction is normally performed at ambient or a depressed temperature, for example 200C to 70 700C, and preferably between OOC and 500C. However when using a phase transfer catalyst it is preferably to conduct the reaction between OOC and ambient temperature. When the thiol of the formula V is used the reaction is normally carried out in the presence of a base. Examples of such bases include sodium hydride, sodium hydroxide, sodium alkoxide such as the methoxide, ethoxide or butoxide, sodium amide, potassium hydroxide such as the methoxide ethoxide or butoxide, potassium amide, and trialkylamines such as triethylamine and tri n propylamine. Of these triethylamine is preferred. Preferably the base is present in an amount of at least 0.9 equivalents, more preferably between 1.0 and 1.2 equivalents per mole of the thiol compound. Instead of using a base in the reaction a reactive derivative of the thiol may be used, preferably the reactive derivative is a salt of the thiol, in particular an alkali metal salt such as sodium or potassium. The amount of thiol compound of the formula V or reactive derivative thereof is generally between 1.0 and 1.5 moles per mole equivalent of the compound of the formula IV . Suitable carboxyl blocking derivatives for the group CO2Ra in formylae IV include salts, esters, and anhydride derivatives of the carboxylic acid. The derivative is one which may readily be cleaved at a later stage of the reaction. The salts need not be pharmaceutically acceptable. Suitable salts include inorganic salts, for example metal salts such as silver or mercuric salt, or alkali metal salts such as the lithium or sodium salt, and tertiary amine salts. Suitable ester forming carboxyl blocking groups are those which may be removed under conventional conditions.

The carboxyl group may be regenerated from any of the above esters by usual methods appropriate to the particular Ra group, for example, acid and base catalysed hydrolysis, or by enzymically catalysed hydrolysis, or by hydrogenation. The hydrolysis must of course be carried out under conditions to which the groups on the rest of the molecule are stable. When it is desired to produce a compound of formula I in the form of a free acid or salt by the process of this invention, a compound of formula IV is generally employed wherein Ra is a carboxyl blocking group. For the preparation of a compound of formula I in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable ester, it is convenient to employ a compound of formula IV whereinRa represents the desired ester group. Preferably the process of this invention is performed on a compound of the formula IV wherein Ra is an ester forming group. Conversion of a compound of the formula I wherein n is zero to a compound of the formula I wherein n is one, may performed by use of an oxidising agent.Suitable oxidising agents include perbenzoic acid, hydrogen peroxide, selenium dioxide and sodium metaperiodate.Substituted perbenzoic acids such as m chloroperbenzoic acid are preferred. The oxidation is conveniently performed in a substantially inert solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform or carbon tetrachloride at an ambient or depressed temperature, preferably between 300C to 200C. In another aspect the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula VI EMI20.1 or salt or ester thereof, wherein RÚ, Rê, R , R4, R6 and n are as defined in relation to formula I which process comprises the elimination of the elements of HX from a compound of the formula VII EMI20.2 wherein RÚ, Rê, R , R4, R6 and n are as defined in relation to formula VI , X is a halo group and Ra is a carboxyblocking group and thereafter if necessary i removing any carb Xy blocking group, ii converting the product into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or an ester, iii oxidising the sulphur atom to afford a sulphoxide. Preferably R6 in the compounds of the formulae VI and VII is C16 alkyl, C37 cycloalkyl, C3 7 cycloalkyl C1,6 alkyl, heterocyclyl, aryl C1 6 alkyl, heteroaryl C1,6 alkyl, heteroaryl, aryl or heterocyclyl C1,6 alkyl. Suitably the elements HX are eliminated by the use of a base of low nucleophilicity, for example tertiary cyclic and acyclic amines such as N methyl moropholine and triethylamine, tertiary bicyclic diazoalkenes such as 1,5 diazabicyclo 4.3.0. non 5 ene and 1,8 diazabicyclo 5. 4. 0. undec 7 ene, and alkali metal bases of low nucleophilicity such as sodium thiophenoxide. Suitably X is chloro, bromo or iodo. The reaction is suitably performed in an organic solvent. The reaction may be performed at any nonextreme temperature, for example 500C to 500C, preferably 20 C to 40 C and most conveniently at ambient temperature. It is preferred to perform the reaction under an inert atmosphere, for example using argon or nitrogen. For the compounds of the formula VII wherein n is one preferred solvents include ethyl acetate,N,N dimethylformamide or dimethylsulphoxide. For the compounds of the formula VII wherein n is zero preferred solvents include dichloromethane and benzene. The compounds of the formula VII are novel and as such form part of this invention. The compounds of the formula VII wherein n is one may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of the formula VIII EMI22.1 wherein R11 R2 R3, R4, R6 and Ra are as defined in relation to formula VII , with an oxidising agent, and thereafter reacting the sulphoxide so produced with a source of electrophilic halogen. Thus this reaction is essentially a two step oxidative halogenation, but the whole process may be carried out without the need to isolate any intermediates. Suitable oxidising agents include per acids and in particular perbenzoic acid and m chloroperbenzoic acid. Sources of electrophilic halogen include N haloamides and N haloimides, for example N halosuccinimides, sulphuryl halides and elemental halogens. We have found that both oxidation and halogenation can be conveniently carried out using approximately 2 molar proportions of iodobenzene dichloride and at least 1 molar proportion of water in an organic solvent in the presence of 3 molar proportions of an organic base.Organic bases which are suitable for use in the iodobenzene dichloride process include tertiary aliphatic amines such as triethylamine and aromatic bases such as pyridine. The reaction is carried out in a organic solvent the choice of which is not critical to the success of these reactions. We have found that aprotic solvents such as halogenated hydrocarbons, benzene and toluene are most convenient. The reactions are best carried out at moderate to low temperatures, i.e. not greater than 300C and not less than 20 C 0 C being convenient. Although it is not essential, the reaction may be usefully carried out under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon. The compounds of the formula VII wherein n iz zero may be prepared by reacting a compound of the formula VIII with a halogenating agent. Preferably one equivalent of a halogenating agent is used, in the presence of base.Preferably iodobenzene dichloride is the halogenating agent. The compound of the formula VIII and its sulphoxide are novel and as such form part of this invention. The compound of the formula VIII may be prepared by the addition of a thiol R 6SH to a compound of the formula IX EMI23.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and Ra are as defined in relation to formula VIII . The addition of the thiol usually takes place in a polar organic solvent such as dimethylformamide at a non extreme temperature, for example 20 C to 400C and most conveniently at ambient. Normally the addition reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as a carbonate or bicarbonate such as those of the alkali or alkaline earth metals for example potassium carbonate. The compound of the formula IX may be prepared by the ring closing elimination of the elements ofR14 R15 R16 P O from an ester of a compound of the formula X EMI24.1 1 2 3 4 wherein R, R, R and R are as defined in relation to formula IX , and R14, R15 and R16 are indipendently phenyl or methoxyphenyl, and thereafter if desired converting the ester group to an alternative carboxyblocking group. The solvent used is an inert organic solvent such as ethyl acetate. Ring closure tends to occur spontaneously so it is sometimes convenient to prepare and ring close the phosphoroane aldehyde in situ.
