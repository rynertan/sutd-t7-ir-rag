Earlier apparatus and techniques are described in the U.SPatent Specifications 3,127,115 3,371,202 ,527,932 3,674,008 3,711,700 3,732,416 3,769,963 4,077,399 4,212,306 4,286,602 USSR Patent Specifications 279,879 and 591,178 in Diaphanologie mammaire byC. Gross J. Radiol Electrol 1972 Vol 53 No 4 pp 297 306 and Etude diphanoscopique des alteration dystrophiques du sein by C. Maggio Senologia June 1978 pp 69 71.It is amongst the aims of the invention to provide improved diaphanoscopy apparatus. General Description of InventionThe invention provides a diaphanoscopy apparatus which is characterised in that means are provided for sequentially illuminating the object with light of at least two different wa velengths, detector means are provided for sensing transilluminated light in relation to each sequential illumination, recording means are provided for separately recording the output of the detector means related to the sequential illumination, and a display means is provided which represents the absorption characteristics of the object at the different wavelengths. The object examined may be human body tissue. Information commensurate with the light which passes through the tissue at each illumination wavelength can be stored.The stored information can be subsequently employed to produce an image which represents the absorption characteristics of the tissue which has been illuminated.Preferably an encoding means is provided for providing a characteristic value which is a function of the sequential outputs of the detector means relating to the different wavelengths and the detector means is adapted for scanning so as to produce an image from a series of characteristic values for different parts of the object. The characteristic value may be a ratio of the successive detector outputs and may be highly revealing of tissue abnormalities.The apparatus includes a source of transillumination light at different frequencies or within different pre selected bands of frequency . The term wavelengths is used in a general indicative fashion. The sequentially emitted light may share some part of the spectrum and may overlap but the spectral characteristics should be sufficiently different to give meaningful results. In accordance with one embodiment, the light source provides light in the red and near infrared regions. The tissue under examination is sequentially illuminated by the different frequency light. The light which passes through the tissue is sensed by a video camera synchronized with the light source. The output of the camera is thus a series of signals corresponding to images of the tissue as illuminated at the light at the different sequentially applied wavelengths.These video signals are separately stored and subsequently employed to form a composite image.Also in accordance with the preferred embodiment, wherein the tissue is alternately transilluminated by light in two separate frequency bands, the information commensurate with the stored images is employed to produce a display wherein each point of the display contains information characteristic of the ratio of the light within each frequency band which has passed through the tissue at a corresponding point. Thus, by way of example, a colour may be assigned to each ratio and a multi colour image formed.The invention secondly provides a non destructive testing method using diaphanoscopy in which an object is transilluminated with light, characterised in that the transilluminating light provides sequentially at least two different spectral compositions, the transilluminated light is detected and the intensity of the sequentially transilluminated light separately recorded for a plurality of object locations and a characteristic value is derived from a combination of the respective intensity values and displayed to provide an image representing the absorption of light on transillumination of the object at different wavelengths.DrawingsFigure 1 is a functional block diagram of an apparatus in accordance with an embodiment of the invention Figure 2 is a timing diagram relating to operation of the apparatus of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a graphical presentation for facilitating understanding of the operation of the apparatus ofFigure 1 Figure 4 is a schematic side elevation view of a light source for use in the apparatus of Figure 1 andFigures 5A and 5B respectively depict shutter and filter devices for use in the apparatus of Figure 4.DescriPtion of the preferred embodimentWith reference now to the drawings, light in the red and near infrared spectrum is employed for transilluminating human body tissue. Light at the different wavelengths chosen will be absorbed by the tissue as a function of wavelength and tissue type. White light is generated by a pair of strobe lights 10 and 12. The strobe lights 10 and 12 include flash lamps which generate light in a comparatively broad spectrum including the red and near infrared regions.The strobe lights 10 and 12 may include commercially available xenon flash tubes. The strobe lights 10 and 12 are respectively controlled by power supplies 14 and 16 which, in response to input commands, apply a trigger pulse to the flash tubes whereby the gas in the tube will ionize and a capacitor will discharge through the tube producing a light pulse of short duration. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention the .duration of the light pulse produced by strobe lights 10 and 12 is ten microseconds and the output power of the lamps is one joule.The light produced by strobe lights 10 and 12 is respectively collected by condensing lens systems 18 and 20 which focus the light at the ends of respective fibre optic bundles 22 and 24. Filters 26 and 28 are disposed in the light path between respective strobe lights 10 and 12 and the associated fibre optic bundles 22 and 24. The filter 26, in the embodiment being described, will pass only wavelengths in the 650 to 750 nanometer, i.e. red, region. The filter 28 will pass light only in the 750 to 850 nanometer, i.e. near infrared, region. The fibre optic bundles 22 and 24 are combined into a single bundle 30. In examining a breast, as depicted in the drawing, the free end of fibre optic bundle 30 is placed in contact with the skin to produce a source of transilluminating light. In the manner to be described in greater detail below, the strobe lights 10 and 12 are alternately energized in synchronism with a video system whereby the tissue of interest will be transilluminated first with red light and then with light in the near infrared region.During transillumination video camera 32 is focused on the breast or other object being examined. In the embodiment being described in camera 32 will include a silicon face plate tube which is responsive in the region from 650 nanometers to 900 nanometers. The camera tube may, for example, comprise a silicon diode array type device available from RCA under the trademark Ultricon . The short bursts of light received by the camera 32 have the effect of discharging, in varying degrees, the surface of the video camera tube. Scanning of the tube surface by an electron beam produces, in the conventional manner, a video output signal. This analog output signal is delivered as the input to an analog to digital converter 34. The digitally coded signals from converter 34 are alternately supplied, via a switch 36, to a pair of frame memories 38 to 40.The memories 38 and 40 may, for example, comprise dynamic memory elements having eight bits of memory for each picture location i.e. each pixel.Operation of the circuitry described above is under the supervision of controller logic 42. The controller 42 comprises a clock, down counter and gates and provides the vertical and horizontal synchronizing signals to the camera 32. Thus, referring to Figure 2, during a first vertical retrace time of the electron beam in the camera 32, the controller 42 will supply a gating pulse 14 to the power supply 14 which will cause the flash tube of strobe light 10 to fire thereby producing an intense burst of light which lasts a few microseconds.As discussed above, this light will be collected by the condensing lens system 18, filtered by filter 26 and the resulting red light delivered to the end of fibre optic bundle 30 which is in contact with the patient.The logic circuit 42 will also control the operation of switch 36, which will typically be an electronic switch, such that the digitally encoded signal produced during a single frame of scanning of the tube in camera 32 will be loaded into memory 38. The memory 38 will thus contain information commensurate with the red light which has passed through the tissue under examination. The time during which the data is being entered into memory 38, i.e. one frame time, is indicated on Figure 2 at 38 . During the next frame the vidicon is permited to recharge fully.During the next, i.e. third, vertical retrace time of camera 32 the controller logic 42 will produce an output signal, indicated at 16 in Figure 2, which causes the firing of the flash tube in the strobe light 12.Accordingly, the breast will, during this retrace time, be illuminated with light in the near infrared region, this light being produced from the output of the strobe light 12 by the filter 28 and delivered to the branch 24 of the bifurcated fibre optic bundle. During the next scanning of the light responsive surface of the video tube of camera 32 the control logic 42 will operate the switch 36 so as to deliver the digitally encoded information commensurate with the near infrared light transmitted through the tissue into the frame memory 40.The time during which information is entered into the memory 40 is indicated in Figure 2 at 40 . Thus, in the embodiment being described, at the end of four frames of the scanning cycle of video camera 32, the tissue being examined will have been illuminated with light of two different colours and the information commensurate with the amount of light of each colour which has passsed through the tissue will be stored in separate memories.The information in the memories 38 and 40 is simultaneously read by an encoder which is indicated generally at 44. In actual practice, the encoder 44 will comprise a RAM which functions as a look up table. To facilitate understanding of the disclosed embodiment of the invention, the encoder 44 has been functionally depicted as a divider 46 and a memory 48.The memory 48 will have, for example, 2 x 28 addresses and numbers corresponding to the intensity of two colours, typically red and green, commensurate with ratios of the numbers which may be stored at each pixel in memories 38 and 40 will be stored at the memory locations in memory 48. The data stored in the memories 38 and 40 will be read by the memory 48 twice the rate of loading of memories 38 and 40. The number stored at the corresponding memory locations in memories 38 and 40 are employed to address memory 48. The memory 48 will produce a pair of colour related, digitally coded output signals for each pizel. This is functionally equivalent to dividing the numbers stored at the memory locations in memories 38 and 40 in the divider 46 and employing the thus produced ratio to address the memory 48.The numbers which are read out of memory 48 comprise digitally coded chrominance signals which, in the example being described, will correspond to a red R intensity and a green G intensity.The numbers read from the memories 38 and 40 are also applied to an adder 50 where they are summed. The output of adder 50 is delivered to a divide by two circuit 52.The output of divider 52 is a digitally encoded average luminance of type signal.The R and G chrominance signals from the memory 48 are converted to analog form by means of digital toanalog converters 54 and 56 while the average luminance signal is converted to analog form by a digital toanalog converter 58. The outputs of the converters 54 and 56 are respectively applied as first inputs to differential amplifiers 60 and 62. The second input to amplifiers 60 and 62 is the luminance signal from the converter 58. The combined luminance and chrominance signals appearing at the outputs ot amplifiers 60 and 62 are applied to a standard TV modulater 64 which also receives synchronizing signals from the controller 42.The modulator 64 provides a composite colour video signal which is delivered to a TV monitor 66. This composite signal will, in the customary fashion, provide horizontal sync, colour burst and colour modulation information for each frame. It is to be noted that, in the interest of reducing the size of the look up memory, in form of the invention, the encoder 44 may look at the most significant six bits of the signals stored in memories 38 and 40 while the adder 50 looked at all eight bits of the stored data.It is also to be noted that the invention may be employed as an analytical tool wherein the ratio of the absorption by the object under examination of light at the transillumination frequencies at any point of interest may be read out and displayed on a monitor 66.To this end a joy stick 68, coupled to potentiometers indicated schematically at 70 and 72, may be employed to provide input signals to an analog to digital converter 74. The converter 74 will, in turn, provide address information to the memories 38 and 40. When there is coincidence between the addresses from converter 74 and the readout address of the memories, a spot or cursor will be displayed on monitor 66 and the contents of the memories will be delivered to a microprocessor via buffers. The microprocessor will, pursuant to its instructions, cause an alphanumeric display which may, for example, be the ratio of absorption of the two transilluminating light wavelengths.Figure 3 may be considered a graphical representation a of the function of the encoder 44. The ratio b of b the numbers commensurate with the amount of light at the top transillumination wave lengths which is passed through the tissue under examination defines straight line curves. Each discrete curve will have assigned thereto chrominance values corresponding to red and green signal amplitude.The amount of absorption of different colour light varies with the nature of the tissue being transilluminated even when tissue is normal. Accordingly, it is desirable to initially perform a normalizing step wh en practicing the invention. Since the absorption of light in the red and near infrared regions.will vary as a function of whether the tissue under examination is glandular or fatty, an initial adjustment will typically be made so that the image of normal tissue will be in a pre selected colour or colours. Thus, in a typical case, normal tissue will be displayed as a white and black image while abnormalities will be represented by colour.The colour white will be commensurate with a pre selected a b ratio Figure 3 and, accordingly, the adjustment, i.e. the normalizing , may be accomplished by varying the voltages applied to flash tubes 10 and 12 Figure 1 to thereby vary the intensity of the two colours of light. It is also possible to separate the light passing through the tissue into two beams which are subsequently filtered and detected, the adjustment being made to the resulting signals. A further possibility would be to employ two vidicons and selectively vary the gain thereof to achieve the normalization .In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention the above discussed step of normalizing is achieved through use of the apparatus of Figures 4 and 5 in place of the pair of flash lamps 10 and 12 and their associated power supplies, lenses and filters as shown in Figure 1. In the apparatus of Figure 4, a motor 80 rotates a drive shaft 82 at a speed determined by a controller 84, controller 84 being responsive to output pulses received from the control logic 42. A disc 86 is mounted on shaft 82 for rotation therewith. Disc 86 is provided with a pair of equal size and oppositely disposed windows. Filters, which correspond respectively to filters 26 and 28 of the Figure 1 embodiment, are respectively mounted in the windows in disc 86 as indicated at 26 and 28 .A source of white light, indicated schematically at 88, is positioned such that the light emitted therefrom will alternately pass through filters 26 and 28 as the disc 86 rotates.The end of the fibre optic bundle 30 is located in alignment with light source 88. Thus, as disc 86 is rotated the fibre optic bundle will alternately receive light in the red and near infrared regions. The speed of motor 80 will be selected such that the tissue under examination will alternately be transilluminated with the different colour light in synchronism with the operation of the camera 32, i.e. during a first frame the tissue will be illuminated with red, during a second frame the vidicon will be read out, during the third frame the vidicon screen will be recharged, during the fourth frame the tissue will be illuminated with infrared, during the fifth frame the infrared data will be read out of the vidicon, during the sixth frame the vidicon screen will be recharged, and the process will thereafter repeat. As noted above, the normalization procedure will typically be performed so as to cause all normal tissue to appear in white on a black background. Thus, at the onset of each examination, the apparatus will be adjusted so that transillumination of the patient s normal tissue will result in camera 32 receiving light of equal intensity during the illumination of the tissue with both red and infrared. This normalization is achieved by mounting a shutter 90 for rotation with the disc 86.Shutter 90 is provided with a pair of different size windows 92 and 93, window 93 being substantially equal in size and shape to the filters 26 and 28 . By means of a differential, indicated generally at 94, the differential being driven from the shaft 82, the shutter 90 is manually rotatable relative to the disc 86 so that one of the filters 26 and 28 may be partially covered while the other remains fully uncovered. This relative rotation is achieved via a control input 94 which can be employed to either advance or retard the shutter 90 relative to the disc 86 while the two discs are rotating at the same speed. A speed reduction mechanism 98, in the form of pulleys and belts, is interposed between the differential 94 and the shutter 90 for the purpose of causing the shutter to rotate at the same speed as the filter carrying disc. While the invention has been described as alternately illuminating the object under examination with light of two different wavelengths, the invention is not limited to transillumination with light of only two different colours or to the use of light within the frequency ranges discussed.
