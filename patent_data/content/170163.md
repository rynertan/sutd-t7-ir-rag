# Device for making a fluid having electrical conductivity flow.

## Abstract
A device for flowing a fluid having electrical conductivity comprises a plurality of fluid passages 14,15 annularly arranged such that electric current can flow across the adjacent passages 14,15 and a magnetic field generating means 16,17 for generating a magnetic flux crossing the plurality of passages 14,15 in radial direction. The electric current induced by making the electrically conductive fluid 18 flow in part of the fluid passages 14,15 is caused to flow in loop through all the fluid passages 14,15 . The electrically conductive fluid 19 existing in the remaining fluid passages is caused to flow by the induced current and the magnetic flux produced in the magnetic field generating means 16,17 , in synchronism with the flow of the fluid 18 flowing through said part of the fluid passages 14,15 .
