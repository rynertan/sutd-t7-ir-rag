# Improvements in or relating to tooth treatment compositions.

## Abstract
A method of determining the electrostatic charge on the surface 2 of an electrically insulating sheet material 3 e.g. an electrophotographic film is disclosed. The method uses the fact that an electrode placed against the opposite surface of a charged material will tend to have an opposite charge through induction. Thus an electrode 4 which may be part of the structure of an electrophotographic material is connected to earth through an electrical circuit 6 . Two suitable circuits are described, one using the principle of a virtual earth amplifier and the other using a circuit arrangement which gives a measurable voltage which corresponds to the integral with respect to time of the current flowing through the lead 8 from the circuit 6 to the electrode 4 .

## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO TOOTH TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS DESCRIP2ION This invention relates to tooth treatment compositions and has particular application to desensitising compositions for use on so called hypersensitive teeth.Tooth sensitivity is exhibited when a sufferer experiences a painful reaction to inter alia pressure, hot, cold, sweet and the like stimulus of a tooth surface and tooth desensitising compositions for the treatment of tooth hypersensitivity are well known for home use in oral hygiene regimens. Such compositions may supplement or replace thereapy undertaken by a dentist. Such prior art compositions may be in the form mouthwashes comprising aqueous solutions or dispersions solutions, dispersions or gels for painting the affected area of the tooth powders or pastes for application to the affected and neighbouring areas toothpastes or dentifrices containing the treatment material in suspensions or solution for cleaning teeth and chewable tablets in which the treatment material is contained. Examples of treatment materials so far proposed for reducing hypersensitivity fall into two classes.One class is of protein precipitants, for example, formalin, silver nitrate, strontium chloride and phenol. The second class, hypothetically, are tubule occluding agents, for example certain fluorides, calcium hydroxide, calcium phosphate, nitrates of alkali metals especially potassium nitrate, strontium chloride also silver nitrate and formalin. By way of example the United States of AmericaPatent No. 3863006 advocated alkali metal nitrates, especially potassium nitrate, for use in aqueous solution or toothpaste or dentifrice in a method of treating hypersensitive teeth. Eurther, in United States of America Patent No.4011309 citric acid and trisodium citrate dihydrate are advocated for use together in an aqueous gel containing as essential ingredient certain water soluble, non ionic polyol surfactants in the treatment of hypersensitive teeth. However, a feature of the prior art formulations is that the desensitizing component has an unpleasant salt flavour, which is difficult to mask, rendering compositions containing them more or less unpleasant to use. It is an object of the present invention to provide a composition for efficacious treatment of tooth hypersensitivity, but one free from the abovestated disadvantage. Accordingly, the present invention provides a tooth treatment composition in liquid or paste form including, to counter tooth hypersensitivity, potassium and citrate ions in antihypersensitivity effective amount. The potassium citrate may be furnished by a nontoxic water soluble potassium salt and a water soluble citrate salt, The composition may include a potassium salt and a citrate which furnish appropriate ions characteristic of a potassium citrate, the counterions forming an innocuous product. The term citrate includes citric acid and or water soluble salts thereof. The potassium citrate may have a non stochiometric composition. Preferably the composition includes a carricr suitable for usc ill the buccal cavity. When a potassium salt other than a potassium citrate is used said salt furnishes the necessary potassium ions in the buccal cavity. Similarly, when the citrate is present the necessary citrate ions are furnished in the buccal cavity. Preferably the composition has, or generates in use, a p11 of from 5 to 9.5, more preferably the pH does not exceed 8.7 and for some compositions the pH is between 5 and 6.5., In the case that the composition is a dentifrice, the pH thereof may by custom have a value in the range pH 4.5 to pH 10.5. It is worth remarking that a pH value so high as pH 10.5 can be at least awkward to achieve in the presence of very large amounts of citrate and or citric acid which act as p11 buffering compositions. The composition may be in the form of an aqueous or alcoholic or glycerol based composition ill the form of a mouthwash, a solution for direct application to a tooth surface as by painting, a toothpaste or dens rice. The invention also envisages non aqueous powders or tablets, for the preparation of aqueous co flpositions within the scope of this invention, and which may be used in admixture with water alone or other suitable media, including aqueous media for example one containing alcohol or glycerol or the like. The amount of potassium and citrate ions furnisllcd is preferably selected in accordance with the precise nature of the composition providing them, that is whether the composition be a mouthwash, a painting fluid, a toothpaste or dentifrice, or a powder tablet for preparing aqueous solutions. Preferably the composition includes a compound of general formula KnH3 nC6H5O7 wherein n is preferably an integer, 1, 2 or 3. Alternatively a chemical equivalent in ionic terms of the compounds so described is contained in the composition. Alternatively, the value of n is fractional in which case the gram ion ratio of potassium ions to citrate ios in the composition is at least 1 10, preferably 1 7, more preferably at least 2 1 and more particularly at least 3 1. Preferably the composition includes up to 405 by weight of a potassium citrate or the equivalent thereof. When the commonly occurring tripotassium citrate, K3C6H5O7.H2O of commerce is used and which is a salt of a strong base with a relatively weak acid, as indecated by the third dissociation constant 6.4 x 10 6 at 18 C, of citric acid, an amount of free citric acid may be admixed to bring the pll down to near neutri. For example, the preferred pI I of an acidic toothpaste or dentifrice is 5.0 to 6.5. When the monopotassium salt, KN2C6H5O7 is usod and which is a salt of a strong base and a strong organic acid as indicated by the first dissociation constant, 7.1 x lO 4 of citric acid,a relatively high concentration of citric acid may not be required for pH adjustment. Dipotassium citrate, K2HC6H5O7 may be employed. It may be noted that the second dissociation constant o citric acid is 1.68 x 10 5 at 18 0C, an acid of strength intermediate the strength of the other two.As a consequence the concentration of citric acid .required as a buffer will be an intermediate value. Thus, it may be seen that the concentrations of potassium and citrate ions will vary in accordance with the nature of the composition and, additionally, the concentrations of citric acid and citrate will vary with the potassium ion concentration in accordance with buffering requirements. Preferably, the potassium citrate used is dipotassium citrate. Free citric acid may be employed in conjunction therewith if desired for the purposes defined above. When the source of potassium ions is other than the above dipotassium salt, free citric acid is preferably also present as the source of citrate ion but citrate salts may be used. Conveniently, the relative amounts of potassium and citrate ions present are the stiochiometric proportions thereof in dipotassium citrate In one embodiment in accordance with the invention the citrate may be in excess of the stoichiometric amount. The amount of potassium and citrate ions present may be at least commensurate with the stoichiometric proportions thereof in monopotassium citrate. The salts and acids may be employed in their hydrated forms, due allowance being made for the weight extent of hydration. When the composition is a toothpaste or dentifrice, the amount of KnH 3 n C6H5O7 or the equivalent thereof present may be up to 10 by weight of the composition as a whole. For example, a toothpaste or dentifrice may contain the equivalent of 0.3t to 9 by weight of a potassium citrate, especially 0 6t to 3 may be employed. When the composition is a mouthwash, paintable composition or composition for the preparation thereof, the amount of KnH3 nC6H5O7 or the equivalent thereof may exceed the preferred amount. Where a treatment composition is designed for frequent repeat dose usage in an ordinary oral hygiene regimen, such as in a toothpaste or dentifrice or a. mouthwash, the equivalent concentration of potassium citrate may be reduced. In toothpastes or dentifrices in accordance with the present invention abradants,, polishing aids or other materials that adsorb, precipitate or otherwise sequester the potassium and or citrate ions must be allowed for. Polymeric materials such as those based upon acrylates, vinyl chloride, olefines and mixtures thereof in particulate or bead form.are preferred as abradants or polishing aids and offer the advantage of relatively controllable abrasivity. Typically, toothpastes or dentifrices in accordance with the present invention will contain the usual sorts of components types and. they may be ankydrous, such as those based on glycerol only or they.may be water based. The latter usually contain humectants, foaming agents, binding or suspending gents, abradants, preservatives, flavourants and water.The salts and acids proposed by the present invention are most easily incorporated in the aqueous or glycerol phase. .As humectant glycerol, sorbitol, propylene glycol, and the like may be employed. Conveniently, the foaming agent is a surfact int or surfactant blend of amphoteric, anionic or nonionic nature for example, amine oxides, sodium lauryl sulphate, the TWEENS. The binding or suspending agents conveili.cntly include gums such as xanthan gum, and thickenors such as bentonite, carboxymethylcellulose and derivatives, laponite and magnesium aluminium silicate. In addition to the above mentioned organic abradants the usual inorganic abradants, including .aluminosilicates, chalks and phosphate may be employed having regard to the above restrictions regarding sequestation. I Other treatment materials, for example for halitosis, anti plaque and plaque removal, nay be incorporated into a toothpaste or dentifrice.Additionally, compounds furnishing fluoride such as sodium, gluoride, stannous fluoride, amine fluorides and sodium monofluorophosphate may be used. Such additaments are intended to provide all round protection in.the one composition. In the above embodiments the ratio of citrate ions to potassium ions is preferably at least 0.3 1. The invention is further illustrated with .reference to the following non limitative Examples in which parts and percentages are by weight of the total composition.

The flavourant was then added and whole stirred to a uniform air free mixture of pM 8.45 prior to filling into tubes with avoidance of the introduction of air bubbles. The toothpaste when tested by volunteers was found to have an agreable taxture, flavour and after taste. It was, generally considered to provide ample foaming and cleansing efficacy. Further, botch voluntecrs and tiie dentists conducting the tests on hypersensitivity found the composition to be at least as efficacious in reduc.ng the effects of hypersensitivity.
