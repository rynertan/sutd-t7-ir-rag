# Paint striper.

## Abstract
A striper 10 has a spring loaded striping head 30 which connects with a reservoir 16 only when the head 10 is depressed by contact with a workpiece, and which does not feed paint or other striping material at any other time. A long, closely fitted tube 31 minimizes leakage and has a side open ing 32 to valve stripe material. The parts are readily disas sembled but are firmly held when assembled, for ready clean ing and replacement of worn parts. The reservoir 16 is prefer ably separate for each head 30 , and separately fed for any striper head 30 or group of striper heads 30 to produce the desired pattern of stripes. The striper heads 30 may be of inter changeable widths. A stop 13 is the only part retaining all heads.
