## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR FILLING AND PACKAGING A FLOWABLE PRODUCT BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention generally relates to a packaging apparatus and method, more particularly to an apparatus and method for filling a flowable product into an open topped container, positioning a closure fitment into the container through its open top, crimping or folding a lip of the container over a portion of the fitment, and sealing the fitment to the folded lip of the container in order to form a sealed packaging and dispensing container for a flowable product.The invention is particularly suitable for filling and assembling sealed packaging and dispensing containers for soft ice cream and the like. In general, although not limited thereto, the packaging apparatus and method according to this invention is adapted for application in connection with the packaging of soft ice cream wherein containers, preferably in the configuration of upwardly open cones, are individually transferred from a stack of a plurality of nested cones onto a conveyor that transports the cones along a predetermined horizontal movement path. During such conveyance along the conveyor path, each cone is indexed to sequential processing stations, whereat each is filled with flowable product, has a closure or extrusion fitment positioned therewithin above the filled flowable product, and has the fitment mechanically fastened to the cones by crimping and energy sealing so as to produce a sealed package that is essentially liquid tight and suitable for marketing to and use by consumers.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Numerous types of apparatus structures and methods are presently known and employed in packaging technology for filling and sealing of flowable products into various kinds of containers. None of the packaging equipment employed herefore contemplate the provision of a novel and unique apparatus and method for effecting high speed filling and packaging of flowable products, such as soft ice cream, sometimes referred to as soft serve ice cream, into sealable containers. The present invention provides a method of enhancing efficiency, while concurrently avoiding the need for complex and expensive equipment in order to render the entire packaging procedure extremely economical.With respect to the different packaging structures and methods which have been developed heretofore, particularly those concerned with the filling and packaging of liquid or s solid, flowable products into salable containers, none of these combine all of the advantageous features of the inventive packaging apparatus and method. The present invention has been able to attain an important result of being able to fill, assemble and seal containers for flowable products, such as soft ice cream, which containers can be readily squeezed to extrude or dispense the product through an orifice in the closure fitment that is assembled to the container protion of the filled, assembled and sealed package. These containers are generally non rigid, readily collapsible, cone shaped structures.This type of packaging for flowable products such as soft ice cream is believed to possess considerable appeal to consumers inasmuch as the resulting package is suitable for ready storage in home freezers and easy dispensing of soft serve ice cream portions for neat and convenient consumption by consumers.Heretofore, packaging technology has not provided a satisfactory and economical means for filling, assembling and sealing such a package in a rapid and efficient manner.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, in order to obviate or ameliorate the limitations and drawbacks of prior packaging lines and methods, especially those employed in the packaging of flowable products, the present invention contemplates the provision of a packaging system that implements, in sequential steps and at various operating stations, the rapid and precise filling of a container with a soft ice cream or the like, the subsequent assembling of the container with a closure and extrusion fitment, and the sealing of the fitment to the container. In an important aspect of the invention, the containers are made of a readily foldable material, the closure and extrusion fitment is positioned within the container at a location spaced below the open end edge or mouth of the container, and the open end edge is then folded over and sealed onto the fitment. The present invention will be apparent from the following description of an exemplary embodiment of an apparatus for packaging a flowable product, such as soft ice cream, in a sealed container incorporating a closure fitment through which the product may be easily and conveniently dispensed or extruded, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is a perspective view of the illustrated filling, assembling and sealing apparatus according to this invention Figure 2 is a front perspective view of the apparatus illustrated in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a perspective view of the preferred container dispensing station Figure 4 is top plan view, partially cut away, of the container dispensing station illustrated inFigure 3 Figure 5 is a perspective view, partially cut away, of the preferred flowable product filling station Figure 6 is an elevational view, partially in longitudinal cross section, of the filling station illustrated in Figure 5 Figure 7 is a perspective view of the closure fitment insertion station whereat a closure fitment is deposited into the open end of each container Figure 8 is a longitudinal sectional view through the fitment insertion station, including phantom illustrations of various operative positions thereof Figure 9 is a longitudinal cross section of the preferred crimping station, shown at its orientation immediately prior to crimping initiation Figure 10 is an elevational view, partially in cross section, of the crimping station shown inFigure 9, illustrated after crimping has been initiated Figure 11 is an elevational view, partially in cross section, of the crimping station, shown after crimping has been completed and prior to withdrawal of the crimping assembly from the crimped package Figure 12 is elevational view, partially in cross section and partially cut away, of a separate sealing station and Figure 13 is an exploded perspective view of the preferred container package that is filled, assembled, and sealed on the apparatus and according to the method of this invention. DETAIL OF THE DESCRIPTION One embodiment of the apparatus, as generally illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, includes a conveyor assembly having a generally horizontal upper run generally designated as 21, a container dispensing station having a dispensing assembly generally designated as 22, a flowable product filler station having a filler assembly generally designated as 23, a fitment insertion station having an insertion assembly generally designated as 24, a crimping station having a crimping assembly generally designated as 25, and a separate sealing station having an energy sealing assembly generally designated as 26. While the drawings illustrate a two lane apparatus, it is to be understood that any number of transversely adjacent lanes may be chosen, within the usual limits of floor space availability and practical maximum fixture sizes and weights. The apparatus operates, in timed sequence, such that the container dispensing assembly 22 deposits an empty container 27 into a container receiving and supporting apperture 28 of the conveyor upper run 21, which intermittently conveys or indexes the empty container 27 to each of the remaining stations.Each container 27 is first indexed to the filler assembly 23 at which flowable product is filled into the container 27 to provide a filled container 27a.Next, a closure fitment 29 that permits the consumer to extrude flowable product therethrough is positioned into the open mouth of the filled container 27a at the insertion station 24. At the crimping station 25, a lip portion 31 of the filled container 27a is folded over the fitment 29. The folded or crimped lip portion 31 may be sealed to the fitment 29 in order to provide a filled and assembled completed package generally designated as 32. This sealing e.g. heat sealing may be effected at the crimping station 25 and or at a separate sealing station 26.Packages 32 are removed from the conveyor assembly in any convenient manner, such as by dropping to a product collector not shown downstream of the sealing station 26. As more fully illustrated in Figures 3 and 4, the container dispensing assembly 22 supports a supply of nested empty containers 27 such that the lowermost nested container 27 is positioned above one of the container receiving and support appertures 28. Dispensing station 22 includes a container support assembly generally designated 33 and a container denester assembly generally designated 34. Container support assembly 33 includes an obstructing opening 35 that is sized and shaped so that at least portions thereof engage the outside surface, typically the lip 31, of the lowermost nested empty container 27 in order to support the nested containers while still permitting passage therethrough of the lowermost container 27 when a generally dwonwardly directed force is applied thereto. In the illustrated embodiment, such obstructing opening 35 includes a plurality of inwardly directed projections that define obstructing portions of the opening 35. Various inwardly spaced obstructions could be provided. Those illustrated include oppositely positioned pins 36 and generally oppositely positioned adjustable brackets 37, each of which preferably has a generally arcuate edge as illustrated.The illustrated means for imparting adjustability to the brackets 37 includes threadedly mounted arms 38 which move the brackets 37 either inwardly or outwardly when a threaded rod 39 is rotated. Denester assembly 34 includes counter rotating pads 41. The illustrated means for effecting counterrotation of the pads 41 includes rotatable shafts 42 that are driven by suitable means, typically an appropriate gear train that runs off of the main drive mechanism of the apparatus not shown . For example, complementary gears may be mounted to the respective rotatable shafts 42 at a location within gear housing 43, such gears not shown being driven by a bevel gear assembly or the like not shown such that the counter rotatng pads 41 are in precise rotational alignment with one another. In operation, the rotationally aligned counterrotating pads 41 of the container dispensing assembly 22 engage generally opposing locations on the lowermost nested container 27 and urge such container 27 downwardly in opposition to the support thereof that is provided by the obstructive opening 35. This combination of functions causes a slight bending of the lip portion 31 of the bottom container 27 as the lip portion 31 is pulled downwardly through the obstructive opening 35. Accurate dropping of each empty container 27 into one of the container receiving and supporting appertures 28 can be facilitated by providing an appropriate arrangement such as the illustrated guiding assembly 44. The container denester assembly 22 will operate in a more consistent manner if a constant load of empty containers 27 is maintained above support assembly 33. Such a result could be effected by means of conventional equipment not shown for monitoring the level of containers in the vertical supply magazine and for automatically feeding additional cones to the magazine when said level falls below a present lower level and until a preset upper level is reached. Convenient and efficient timing of the movement of the conveyor upper run 21 with respect to this delivery of each empty container 27 by the container dispensing assembly 22 is achieved by providing substantially constant counter rotation of the pads 41 such that one complete rotation of each pad 41 corresponds to one complete index of the entire apparatus. During each index, each apperture 28 moves upstream through a distance equal to the longitudinal spacing between consecutive appertures 28. Flowable product filler assembly 23 is shown in more detail in Figures 5 and 6. A filling valve 45 is mounted above and in general alignment with a container receiving and supporting apperture 28 that has been indexed thereunder, such alignment being acomplished by including appropriate means not shown for timing the operation of each filling valve 45 with the indexing movement pattern of the conveyor run 21 such that each filling operation is carried out when an apperture 28 is generally coaxially positioned under each filling valve 45. Each filling valve 45 is connected through a suitable conduit 46, to a substantially constant supply of flowable product such as soft ice cream.The flowable product exits each filling valve 45 through a depending discharge nozzle 47, which is designed to enter and protrude to a substantial extent into a container 27 in order to facilitate l bottom uptt filling of each container 27. Various approaches can be used to achieve l bottom up filling, which is an important aspect of filling a flowable product in order to minimize or eliminate formation of air pockets within the filled flowable product. This is especially important when the container being filled has a portion that has a substantially narrower cross section than other portions of the container, such as the illustrated conically shaped containers. With bottom upi filling, according to this invention, the initial stage of filling each container 27 is carried out when the nozzle 47 projects a substantial distance into the container 27 and relatively closely spaced from the narrowed, apical portion thereof. As filling proceeds, and before the product being filled contacts the protruding end of the discharge nozzel 47, relative movement begins between the discharge nozzle 47 and the container 27 such that the distance between them increases. Preferably, for conically shaped containers, this relative movement putting aside for now any possible variation in the speed at which flowable product is delivered out of the discharge nozzle 47 preferably quickly reaches its maximum speed and thereafter decelerates until the flowable product is filled to the desired height. By this approach, the volume of flowable product flowing into respective cross sections of the conical volume of the container 27 will increase during the period of such decelerating relative movement since the nozzle 47 will remain at each cross section, during deceleration, for increasing lengths of time, thereby providing an increasing volume flow to fill the increasingly sized cross sections of the concial volume. If possible this relative movement preferably includes exceptionally rapid initial acceleration in order to minimize the likelihood of having flowable product splash out of the container 27. Such splashing occurs when flowable product fills the narrow bottom of the container 27 so rapidly that it engages the bottom of the discharge nozzle 47 and spurts thereabove through the relatively narrow opening between the bottom of the discharge nozzle 47 and the walls of the container 27 at a relatively narrow cross sectional location thereof. This preferred rapid acceleration and gradual deceleration of the relative movement between the discharge nozzle 47 and the container 27 can be achieved by upward movement of the filling valve 45, downward movement of the container 27, or a combination of both such movements. The arrangement illustrated in Figures 1, 2, 5 and 6 provides a combination of upward movement of each filling valve 45 and downward movement of each container 27, and each filling valve 45 includes an arrangment for gradually increasing the flow of product therethrough while the filling valve 45 moves upwardly. In the illustrated embodiment, the following sequence of steps is performed. By a suitable mechanism, such as a cam system driven by the main drive shaft of the apparatus not shown , pneumatic cylinders or the like, each valve 45 is vertically movable, and a valve stem 48 is vertically movable within each filling valve 45.Each valve stem 48 extends upwardly out of its filling valve 45 and has a threaded cap 50 that is mounted to a support bar 49 by means of a threaded rod 51. Rotation of the threaded rod 51 relative to the cap 50 provides fine tuing adjustment of the spacing between the support bar 49 and the cap 50 of the valve stem 48 to thereby precisely adjust the engagemellt of a plunger 52 on the bottom of each valve stem 48 with a seat 53 of each filling valve 45. Accordingly, when a shaft 54 that supports the bar 49 is raised with respect to a coaxial shaft 55 that supports a bar 56 to which the filling valves 45 are mounted, the valve stem 48 is raised within the valve 45, and the plunger 52 is moved away from the seat 53 to thereby effect an opening of the filling valve 45.When shaft 54 moves downwardly into coaxial shaft 55, plunger 52 moves downwardly into engagement with seat 53 in order to thereby close the filling valve 45. Also provided in the embodiment illustrated inFigures 1, 2, 5 and 6 is a lifter mechanism, generally designated 57, for raising container 27 out of the apperture 58 and for lowering filled container 27a into the apperture 28. Lifter mechanism 57 includes a holder 58 positioned below and generally coaxial with each apperture 28 when it is indexed to and positioned at the filler assembly 23. Each holder 58 closely receives a container 27. Preferably, each holder 58 includes a generally V shaped passageway 59 to facilitate longitudinal passage of containers 27 into and out of each holder 58 and to reduce the stroke length required of the lifter mechanism 57, which further includes appropriate support structure, such as the illustrated vertical shaft and mounting bracket assembly 61.As mentioned above the lifter mechanism is not a necessary element of the packaging system of this invention. The illustrated flowable product filler assembly 23 operates as follows. An apperture 28 having a container 27 is indexed to be generally coaxial with the discharge nozzle 47 and the holder 58. Lifter mechanism 57, if present, is actuated by appropriate means in order to raise the holder 58 to thereby lift the container 27 out of the apperture 28 to a position generally illustrated in Figures 5 and 6. At substantially the same time, a suitable drive mechanism moves the coaxial shaft 55 downwardly, for example within a stationary shaft 62. When these movements are completed, the tip of nozzle 47 is positioned at its lowermost location within the container 27. Next, the drive mechanism begins to slide the shaft 54 within coaxial shaft 55 to thereby open the filling valve 49 to permit flowable product to pass out of discharge nozzle 47 and into the bottom of the container 27. This movement continues, and plunger 52 increasingly moves away from the tapered seat 53 which, in turn, gradually increases the size of the valve opening to increase the volume rate of product flow out of the discharge nozzle 47. Generally simultaneously, the lifter mechanism 57 moves downwardly until each container rests within its apperture 28. When container 27a has been filled to the desired level, the drive mechanism rapdily slides the shaft 54 into coaxial shaft 55 to thereby close the filling valve 45 by engaging the plunger 52 with its seat 53. At this stage, coaxial shaft 55 and sahft 54 are moved upwardly together so that the filling valve 45 is raised an appropriate distance above the lip portion 31 of the container 27. This upward movement insures that the tip of nozzle 47 is above and well clear of the container 27, while also providing an upward length of travel that is sufficient to break off any flowable product that is suspended between the tip of nozzle 47 and product of the filled container 27a before the conveyor run 21 ir dexes will in the downstream direction. One embodiment of fitment insertion assembly 24 is more particularly illustrated in Figures 7 and 8. A plurality of closure and extrusion fitments 29 are nested in a holder 55 in an essentially inverted orientation, the bottom one of which is accessible to a cup 63, which is rotatably mounted and driven between an upwardly directed orientation illustrated in solid in Figure 8 and a downwardly directed orientation illustrated in phantom in Figure 8 .When in the upwardly direction orientation, the cup 63 removes the lowermost fitment 29 from its nested position and transports that fitment 29 to a location at which it is inserted within the filled container 27a. Such insertion of the fitment 29 into the filled container 27a is to a distance such that the free external peripheral edge 60 of the fitment 29 generally defines the lip portion 31 of the filled container 27a. While various structures may be used for effecting this result, the illustrated structure includes a camming assembly having a driving cam path 64 and its cam follower 66 and an aligning cam path 65 and its cam follower 69. The camming assembly also includes a drive gear 67, a driven gear 68 that meshes therewith and that is secured to the cam follower 69. A driven gear 68 is also firmly secured to a driven rotatable shaft 71, onto which each cup 63 is securely mounted. Driven shaft 71 is rotatably mounted to a support 72, which is in turn secured to an appropriate drive assembly, such as one including the illustrated vertical shaft 73. Movement of the vertical shaft 73 downwardly from the position shown in Figure 8 effects the movement of the cup 63 from the upwardly directed position to its downwardly directed position along the path illustrated inFigure 8.Upward movement of the support 72 results in a reverse direction tracking of this same path. Most conveniently, the cup 63 includes a vacuum assembly for pulling a vacuum through a cup orifice 74 in order to engage a fitment 29, which vacuum is released when fitment insertion is completed. When the support 72 and the cup 63 initially move downwardly, the lowermost fitment 29 moves downwardly therewith, and the remainder of the stack of fitments 29 stay within the holder 75. The illustrated means for accomplishing this includes a plurality of spring clips 76 which are pushed outwardly with respect to the axis of the holder 75 when they are engaged by the cup 63. When cup 63 moves downwardly, each spring clip 76 rapidly moves generally inwardly and engages the next fitment 29 within the nest to thereby hold same and the remainder of the nest in place until the cup 63 returns to its uppermost position. An alternate arrangement not shown for feeding fitments 29 to filled containers 27a is to feed the fitments from a bulk hopper into a chute and or conveyor assembly which will transport the circular fitments to a location immediately above lip portion 31 of filled cotainers 27a at which location the fitment is retained in a circular aperture having a diameter slightly smaller than the unflexed outer diameter of the fitment. From this location the fitments are pushed through the aperture and inserted within filled containers 27a by means of a vertically oriented plunger which operates in timed relation with the indexing of filled container to the fitment insertion station. Crimping assembly 25 is provided in order to inwardly and downwardly fold the lip portion 31 of each filled container 27a over the peripheral edge 60 and onto an inner face 77 of each fitment 29. In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 9, 10 and 11, this crimping or folding of the lip portion 31 is achieved by its engagement with a plurality of radially openable and closeable arcuate crimping segments 78, the illustrated crimping segments combining, when closed, to define a generally circular structure. Crimping segments 78 are open as illustrated inFigure 9 when they first are positioned for engagement with the lip 31. Next, the crimping segments close to their generally circular configuration, thereby bending the lip 31 to the generally horizontal orientation thereof illustrated in Figure 10.Thereafter, the generally closed crimping segments 78 move downwardly to thereby fold the lip portion 31 to a generally vertical orientation which sub stantially overlies the inner face 77 of the fitment 29. Then, the closed crimping segments 78 are raised to permit indexing movement of the crimped container and fitment assembly to the next downstream station. This movement sequence of the crimping segments 78 may be accomplished by any suitable means, the illustrated means having been found to provide adequate and efficient operation in this regard.Each crimping segment 78 is rotatably mounted to a sleeve 79 and is in levered engagement with a shaft 81 slidably mounted within the sleeve 79 such that upward movement of the shaft 81 with respect to the sleeve 79 closes the crimping segments 78 and a downward movement of the shaft 81 with respect to the sleeve 79 opens the crimping segments 78. With more particular reference to the orientation illustrated in Figure 9, the crimping segments 78 are maintained in their open orientation in opposition to a compressed spring 82, which compression is maintained by the engagement of a latch 83 with a shaft mount 84. Loading to this orientation is facilitated by providing a stop 85 to limit upward movement of the shaft mount 84, such loading being carried out when the shaft mount 84 is at its uppermost orientation not shown . In Figure 10, the latch 83 has been moved from the shaft mount 84, and the spring 82 has been released, which release permits the spring 82 to move the shaft mount 84 and the shaft 81 upwardly to effect the desired closing of the crimping segments 78. This disengagement of the latch 83 from the shaft mount 84 is triggered by the downward movement of the crimping assembly 25 until a trigger 86, which is rigidly mounted to the latch 83, engages and is moved generally outwardly by a stationary protrusion 87 that is mounted independently of the rest of the crimping assembly 25. This results in the generally horizontal folding of the lip portion 31. Crimping assembly 25 continues to move downwardly while the crimping segments 78 are in this closed orientation in order to complete the crimping operation. Then, the crimping assembly 25 moves upwardly to clear the thus crimped fitment and container assembly, which is next indexed to the following station. Upward movement continues until the stop 85 is engaged and the assembly 25 is reloaded to its open orientation to permit downward movement and return to the Figure 9 position. A spring loaded plunger 88 may be provided to engage each fitment 29 in order to be assured that each fitment 29 is properly seated and substantially horizontally positioned within the filled container 27a. A separate sealing assembly station 26 may be included for applying appropriate sealing energy to achieve a permanent joining of the crimped lip portion 31 of the filled container 27a to the inner face 77 of the fitment 29. One means for accomplishing this function is shown in Figure 12, which illustrates a sealing assembly 26 including a mechanism for ejecting fitments 29 from the sealing assembling 26. Illustrated sealing assembly 26 includes a vertically movable sealer head 89, which has an annular bottom sealing lip 91 that is sized and structured so as to generally conform to the shape and size of the inner face 77 of the fitment 29. At the time that a container receiving and supporting apperture 28 is indexed to a position below and substantially coaxial with the annular bottom sealing lip 91, the sealing head 89 is displaced downwardly, typically by being driven off of the drive shaft not shown of the apparatus, until the annular bottom sealing lip 91 nests against the crimped lip portion 31 and exerts pressure thereon to tightly engage the folded over lip portion 31 with the inner face 77 of the fitment 29.At this stage, the sealing head 89 imparts sealing energy by well known means such as the application of heat to the sealing lip 91 which effects heat sealing between the fitment lip portion 31 and the inner face 77. Occasionally during the course of operation of the apparatus, a container 27 is not properly deposited by the dispensing assembly 22 within a particular container receiving and supporting apperture 28, with the result that only a fitment 29 is conveyed to the sealing assembly 26. Should this happen, then the sealing lip 91 will directly engage the fitment inner face 77 and will tend to hang up on the sealing lip 91 because it is partially melted thereonto, or the fitment 29 is mechanically jammed onto the sealing lip 91. The possible occurrence of this problem is increased because fitments 29 are typically of a very light weight that is inadequate to offset these hang up forces. This problem is substantially eliminated by the illustrated embodiment having a knock out assembly which includes a spring loaded sleeve 92 and a knock out plate 93 mounted thereonto.Mounting of the knock out plate 93 to the sleeve 92 is accomplished by a pin 94, which is preferably generally U shaped. Pin 94 is fed through two pairs of opposing holes 95 only one hole 95 being shown within the spring loaded sleeve 92. Thus assembled pin 94 also passes through slots 96 of the sealer head 89. In operation, when the sealer head 89 moves downwardly to engage a fitment 29, a raised central portion 97 of the fitment 29 engages and raises the knock out plate 93. This raising movement is imparted, through the pin 94, to the sleeve 92, which thereby compresses a spring 98 to bias the knock out plate 93 toward the downward direction.Then, when the sealer head 89 is raised after completion of the sealing cycle, the knock out plate 93 moves downwardly in order to exert a downward force on the raised central portion 97 and to eject the fitment 29 thereof, whether or not that fitment 29 is sealed to a filled container 27a. As an alternative to, or possibly an addition to, a separate sealing station 26 it would be possible to blow heated air onto the lip portion 31 of each filled container 27a and onto the inner face 77 of each fitment 29 such that these surfaces are softened sufficiently to bond together with a permanent or temporary heat seal during the crimping operation. The sealed and filled container and fitment package 32 is then conveyed along the upper conveyor run 21 for eventual discharge from the apperture 28.This discharge can, if desired, be assisted by suitable means, such as an ejector assembly 99 Figure 2 positioned at the discharge end of the conveyor, the ejector assembly 99 being reciprocable and being driven by suitable means run from or otherwise sequentially timed to the indexing sequence of the apparatus. Figure 13 more fully illustrates the structure of one embodiment of products or packages that are assembled on the apparatus and according to the method of this invention. Illustrated container 27 is a collapsible cone shaped assembly including an inner cone shaped member 101 and an outer cone shaped member 102 that are secured to one another in order to provide a liquid impervious container 27. Outer member 102 may be made of an inexpensive material having acceptable hand feel, paper being an especially suitable material Inner member 101 is made of a material that will be sealed by the sealer head 89 onto the fitment 29, the typical material therefor being a thermoplastic film. Container 27 is substantially flexible and may be readily collapsed by squeezing, or in essence, applying external surface pressure thereto. Closure and extrusion fitment 29 includes a substantially frusto conical raised central portion 97 that extends at its base into an annular flange of generally U shaped configuration including the inner face 77 and its free peripheral edge 60. The raised central portion 97 includes an extrusion orifice 103 which is closed by a removable cover 104. When the product, such as soft ice cream, that is sealed within the package assembly is to be dispensed by the consumer, the cover 104 is removed to expose the extrusion orifice 103, whereby the soft ice cream or the like is dispensed or extruded through the orifice 103 by manually applying external surface pressure or squeezing action to the container 27. From the foregoing, it is readily apparent that the invention provides a novel and relatively uncomplicated apparatus and method for filling and sealing packaging assemblies for flowable products such as soft ice cream or the like. While there has been shown and described what are considered to be preferred or suitable embodiments of the invention, it will of course be understood that various modifications and changes in form or detail could readily be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. It is therefore intended that the invention be not limited to the exact form and detail herein shown and described, nor to anything less than the whole of the invention herein disclosed as hereinafter claimed.
