# Cardiac stimulator with frequency self regulation through the electrocardiographic T wave.

## Abstract
The pacemaker utilizes for cardiac stimulation, an algor ithm whose stimulation frequency varies according to the metabolic adaptation requirements of the oganism to stress, emotion and the like. The said algorithm is based essentially on the variation in the slope of the initial section of the T wave.
