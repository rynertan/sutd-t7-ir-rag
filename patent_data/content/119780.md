# ELECTRONIC INTERFERENCE SHIELDING LAMINATE

## Abstract
Electronic interference shielding of electronic apparatus to a substantial degree is accomplished by using, as the shielding element, a delamination resistant and formable polymer metal foil laminate. It comprises a flame retardant and relatively rigid, yet formable polymer film, an adhesive layer attached to the polymer film, and a metal foil, of less thickness than the thickness of the polymer film, attached to the side of the adhesive layer remote from the side attached from the polymer film.
