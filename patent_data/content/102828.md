# A METHOD FOR WITHDRAWING SOLIDS FROM A HIGH PRESSURE VESSEL

## Abstract
Solids are withdrawn from a pressurised reactor by passing the solids from the reactor to a stripping vessel maintained at a pressure approximately equivalent to the pressure in the reactor wherein the solids are contacted with a volatilised liquid to displace gases. The stripped solids are then passed through a conduit containing valve means into a lockpot pressurised and the volatilised liquid to a pressure approximately equivalent to the pressure in the stripping vessel. The solids free section of the lockpot communicates with a condenser vessel pressurised with the volatilised liquid to a pressure approximately equivalent to the pressure in the lockpot. After the solids have been passed into the lockpot, the valve means is closed and the volatilised liquid in the condenser is condensed thereby decreasing the pressure in the condenser which simultaneously results in a decrease of pressure in the lockpot. Depressured solids are then removed from the lockpot.
