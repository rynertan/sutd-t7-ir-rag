# Endodontic unit.

## Abstract
The unit comprises an elongated ultrasonic oscillating body having a tubular conduit 26 extending beyond one end and provided with a weighted head 38 on the outer end and in which a socket 40 is formed and disposed at an obtuse angle 6 to the axis of the body by means of providing a bend 36 in said conduit intermediately of the ends thereof sub tending an obtuse angle a of greater magnitude than the obtuse angle of said socket, the weight of said head being adequate to damp the vibrations imposed upon an endodon tic file, 44 when mounted in the socket, to a degree sufficient to minimize the breakage of files and also induce in the files desired vibratory and oscillating movement to effect efficient operation in endodontic performance. The socket has a larger diameter than the shank of the file, whereby a space 46 is provided in the socket to discharge liquid medicament lon gitudinally along the file.
