# MACHINE MONITORING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A system is provided for collecting and interpreting data indicative of the effect of at least one of the plurality of forces acting on a machine for forming and or bending metals 252 . The system comprises one or more structural moment detectors 251 , and electronic circuitry 253 for processing and manipulating signals derived from the detector or detectors 251 in such a manner as to produce secondary signals indicative of the effect being monitored. In one embodiment, the electronic circuitry associated with each structural moment detector 251 is provided in the same housing as the detector to form a unitary device termed a structural information detector.
