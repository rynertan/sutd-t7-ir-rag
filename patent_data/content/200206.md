## Description
This invention relates to a silver halide photographic light sensitive material. Heretofore, in the field of a silver halide photographic light sensitive material, a 5 pyrazolone type coupler has popularly been used for a magenta dye image coupler. However, this kind of couplers cannot avoid unnecessary secondary absorption because they have a yellow component around 430nm and this phenomenon has sometimes caused a color turbidity. Accordingly, for the purpose of solving the color turbidity problems, there have been the proposals of the 1H pyrazolo 3,2 C S triazole type couplers, namely, a coupler comprising an 1H pyrazolo 3,2 C S triazole derivative , Refer to U.S. Patent No. 3.725,067 British Patent Nos. 1,252,413 and 1,334,515 and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 99437 1984 and 228252 1984 . With this type of couplers, the above mentioned problems may be solved, because such couplers may be able to avoid nearly all of the unnecessary secondary absorption. In some coupler, the color density thereof may sometimes be lowered by formalin which is used as an insecticide to furnitures and the like . In contrast with such a coupler, this type of couplers have the advantages that the density lowering is substantially less in a formalin atmosphere and the preservation thereof may easily be made and further the sensitivity thereof is high. On the other hand, it was found that this type of couplers have such undesirable photographic characteristics as that fogs are increased or the sensitivity is lowered at a high temperature and during a long lapse of time before the couplers which were mixed with an emulsion are coated on a film surface and dried. U.S. Patent No. 3,632,373 and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 212092 1984 each disclose such a means that a coating solution stability is to be improved in such a manner that an emulsion and a dispersed liquid are mixed up together immediately before coating the resulted mixture on and the mixture is coated on and dried up. These means are still not fully satisfied and have been unable to improve the above mentioned stability particularly in a high temperature preservation of film. In recent years, as there have been more strict requirements for silver halide emulsions for photographic use, so have increased the demands for the high level photographic characteristics such as for example a high speed, an excellent graininess, a clear cut sharpness, a low fog density, or a sufficiently wide exposure range. There have been the well known high speed emulsions such as a silver iodobromide emulsion containing iodide in an amount of from 0 to 10 mol of the emulsion, to satisfy the above mentioned requirements. About the processes of preparing the above mentioned emulsions, there have so far been the well known processes including, for example, an ammonia process, a neutral process, such a process as an acid process in which the conditions of pH and pAg values are controlled, and such a precipitation process as a single jet or double jet process. Based upon the above mentioned prior art and with the purposes of making the sensitivity of light sensitive materials higher and improving the graininess thereof and, further, achieving both of the high sharpness and low fog thereof, the technical means have so far been researched with an utmost precision and have then been put into practice. A silver iodobromide emulsion which is an object of the invention have been studied so as to control not only the crystal habits and grain distribution but also the iodide density distribution in an individual silver halide grain. For realizing the photographic characteristics including, for example, a high speed, excellent graininess, high sharpness or low fog density, the most orthodox process therefor is to improve the quantum efficiency of a silver halide used. For realizing this purpose, the observation of solid state physics have positively been adopted. There are the researches in which the above mentioned quantum efficiency was theoretically computed and the influence on a graininess distribution was also studied. One of the researches is described in, for example, the preprints of 1980 Tokyo Symposium on Photographic Progress, titled Interactions Between Light and Materials . p. 91. This research predicts that a quantum efficiency could effectively be improved if a monodispersed emulsion may be prepared by narrowing a grain distribution. Further, in the so called chemical sensitization process for sensitizing a silver halide emulsion This process will be described in detail later. , it may be reasonably presumed that a monodispersed emulsion may also be advatageous to effectively make a light sensitive material highly sensitive with keeping a low fog level. For industrially preparing such a monodispersed emulsion, it is desired, as described in Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection hereinafter called Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 48521 1979, to apply both of the theoretically predetermined conditions of the feeding rate controls of silver ions and silver halide ions to be fed into a reaction system and the satisfactory conditions of the agitation thereof to the preparation process under the strict controls of the pAg and pH values of the emulsion. When a silver halide emulsion is prepared under the above mentioned conditions, it is in either one of the cubic, octahedral and tetradecahedral crystal forms. That is to say, such an emulsion comprises the so called normal crystal grains each having both of the 100 and 111 planes in various ratios. It is well known that a high sensitization may be achieved by making use of the above mentioned normal crystal grains. Meanwhile, it has so far been well known that the silver halide emulsions suitably used in high speed photographic films include a silver iodobromide emulsion comprising polydispersed type twinned crystal grains. Also, silver iodobromide emulsions each containing tabular shaped twinned crystal grains are disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 113927 1983 and others. On the other hand, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 22408 1978 Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 13162 1968 Journal of Photographic Science . No. 24, p. 198, 1976 each describe, respectively, that a development activity is increased or a high sensitization is realized by making use of multilayered type silver halide grains applied with a plurality of shells on the outside of the inner cores of the grains. Further, West German Patent No. 2,932,650 Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 2417 1976, 17436 1976 and 11927 1977 describe the respective silver halide grains each provided with a covering layer through a halogen substitution so as to serve as the outermost layer of the silver halide grain. These silver halide grains are practically unable to serve as any negative type emulsion, because a fixing time may be shortened thereby, however, to the contrary, a development may be thereby inhibited, so that a satisfactory sensitivity may not be obtained. There is also well known positive type i.e., an internal latent image type silver halide grains each provided outside the inner core thereof with a plurality of covering layers prepared through a halogen substitution, of which are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,592,250 and 4,075,020 and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 127549 1980. These silver halide grains are often used in an internal latent image type direct positive light sensitive material such as those for diffusion transferring use. However, they cannot be used at all in any negative type emulsion to which the invention directed, because the internal sensitivity thereof is excessively high from the very nature of things. There is a further silver halide grain provided on the inner core thereof with shells, as described above, and in which various iodide contents of the respective layers thereof are taken into account. This type of grains are described in, for example, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 181037 1983, 35726 1985 and 116647 1984. In the field of silver halide photographic light sensitive materials, color light sensitive materials each having an ISO speed of 1000 or over have recently been introduced, thanks to the various technical progress. It is, however, usual that such a light sensitive material is deteriorated in graininess and sharpness as it becomes higher in sensitivity, and such a high speed light sensitive material is yet very unsatisfactory for the consumers who want to admire a good photograph because its image quality is not good enough as compared with those of a conventional light sensitive material. Therefore, a high speed negative type light sensitive material excellent in graininess and image sharpness has so far been demanded. For astronomical photography, indoor photography, or sport photography as examples, a further high speed negative type light sensitive material has particularly been demanded. It is an object of the invention to provide a negative type silver halide photographic light sensitive material which is excellent in preservability and stability on liquid state standing in the course of preparing an emulsion containing a pyrazoloazole type magenta coupler excellent in harmful gas resistance excellent in high sensitivity and relation between sensitivity and fog broad in exposure range and excellent in graininess ans sharpness. A silver halide photographic light sensitive material having at least one silver halide emulsion layer, wherein the silver halide emulsion layer comprises a magenta coupler represented by the general formula I and a negative type silver halide grains of a core shell structure whic consists of an inner core essentially consisting of silver bromide or silver iodobromide and a plurality of shells essentially consisting of silver bromide or silver iodobromide, and the plurality of shells comprises an outermost shell containing 0 to 10 mol of silver iodide, a high iodide containing shell provided inside said outermost shell of which silver iodide content is at least 6 mol higher than that of the outermost shell, and an intermediate shell provided between the outermost shell and said the highly iodide containing shell of which a silver iodide content is at least 3 mol higher than that of the outermost shell, and at least 3 mol lower than that of the highly iodide containing shell wherein Z represents a group of non metal atoms necessary for complete a nitrogen containing heterocyclic ring which may have a substituent, X represents a hydrogen atom, halogen atom or monovalent group which is, upon reaction with an oxydation product of a color developing agent, capable of being released from the coupler residue and R represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or a monovalent group. In the silver halide composition of the silver halide grains relating to the invention, the above mentioned expression, substantially comprising ... , means that the silver halide composition is allowed to contain other silver halide than silver bromide or silver iodobromide, such as silver chloride and, more particularly, silver chloride having a proportion of not more than 1 mol is desired. The special features of the photographic light sensitive materials of the invention may be summarized as given below For the purpose of further improving the above mentioned excellent effects in the following terms Further, the volume of an outermost shell is preferably from 4 to 70 of a whole grain and, more preferably, from 10 to 50 thereof. The volume of a highly iodide containing shell is preferably from 10 to 80 of a whole grain and, more preferably, from 20 to 50 and, further preferably, from 20 to 45 thereof. The volume of an intermediate shell is preferably from 5 to 60 of a whole grain and, more preferably, from 20 to 55 thereof. An iodide content of a highly iodide containing shell is preferably from 6 to 40 mol and, more preferably, from 10 to 40 mol . Such highly iodide containing shell may be at least one part of an inner shell and, more preferably, a separate inner shell is to be provided to the inner side of the highly iodide containing shell. The iodide content of such an inner core is preferably from 0 to 40 mol and, more preferably, from 0 to 10 mol and, further preferably, from 0 to 6 mol . The grain size of such an inner core is preferably from 0.05 to 0.8µm and, more preferably, from 0.05 to 0.4µm. The iodide content of a whole grain is preferably from 1 to 20 mol and, more preferably, from 1 to 15 mol and, further preferably, from 2 to 12 mol . The grain size distribution is allowed to be either one of the polydisperse type and the monodispere type. However, variation coefficient of such grain size distribution is preferably not more than 20 in a monodispersed emulsion and, more preferably, not more than 15 . Such a variation coefficient will be defined as follows to measure a monodispersibility A grain size of a silver halide grain which is defined as a length of one side of a cube having the same volume as that of the silver halide grain is preferably from 0.1 to 3.0µm and the configuration thereof may be any one for example an octahedron, a cube, a sphere or a flat plate and, more preferably, an octahedron. The layer arrangements of the silver halide grains of the invention will further be described below An inner core and a highly iodide containing shell may be the same, or the such inner core may separately be provided to the inside of the highly iodide containing shell. An inner core and a highly iodide containing shell, the highly iodide containing shell and an intermediate shell, and the intermediate shell and the outermost shell are allowed to be adjacent to each other and, in addition, it is also allowed that another shell comprising at least one layer having an arbitrary composition hereinafter called an arbitrary shell may be interposed between the above mentioned shells. The above mentioned arbitrary shell may be any one of a monolayered shell having a uniform composition, a group of the shells which comprises a plurality of shells each having a uniform composition and changes its compositon stepwise, a continuous shell which changes its composition continuously in its arbitrary shell, and the combination thereof. The above mentioned highly iodide containing shell and intermediate shell may be used plurally or in only a pair. Next, the examples of the layer arrangements of the silver halide grains relating to the invention will now be described Wherein, an iodide content will be represented by I and a subscript represents an order of a shell. The inner cores of the silver halide grains of the invention can be prepared in such a process as described in, for example, P. Glafkides, Chimie et Physique Photographique , published by Paul Montel, 1967 G.F. Duffin, Photographic Emulsion Chemistry , published by The Focal Press, 1966 V.L. Zelikman et al, Making and Coating Photographic Emulsion , published by The Focal Press, 1964. Such processes include any one of an acid process, a neutral process, an ammonia process and others known in the literature. Further, a single jet precipitation process, a double jet precipitation process or the combination thereof may also be applied to make a reaction of a soluble silver salt on a soluble halide. Still further, it is also allowed to use the so called reverse precipitation process in which grains may be formed in presence of silver ions in excess. The so called controlled double jet precipitation process, a version of the double jet precipitation processes, may also be applied for keeping a pAg value of a silver halide produced in a liquid phase. According to this process, a silver halide emulsion regular in crystal form and nearly uniform in grain size may be prepared. It is also allowed to use a mixture of not less than two kinds of silver halide emulsions each prepared separately, and in this case a double jet precipitation process or a controlled double jet precipitation process is preferably used. A pAg value is varied in accrdance with a reaction temperature and the kinds of silver halide solvents when an inner core is prepared, and is preferably from 2 to 11. It is also preferred to use a silver halide solvent, because a grain forming time may be shortened. Such a silver halide solvent as those of ammonia or thioether which is well known may be used. Inner cores may be used in a flat plate, sphere or twinned crystal system and also in the form of an octahedron, cube, tetradecahedron or the mixed forms thereof. In order to uniform grain sizes, it is preferred to grow up grains rapidly within the critical saturation limit, in such a process as described in, for example, British Patent No. 1,535,016 and Japanese Patent Examined Publication Nos. 36890 1973 and 16364 1977, in which the respective adding rates of silver nitrate and an aqueous solution of a halogenated alkali are adjusted according to the growth rate of grains or in such a process as described in, for example, 4,242,445 and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 158124 1980, in which the concentration of an aqueous solution is adjusted. The above mentioned processes are advantageously used also in the case of introducing arbitrary shells, highly iodide containing shells, intermediate shells or the outermost shells, because any renucleation will not occur and each silver halide grain is uniformly coated in these processes. In the invention, if occasion demands, a single shell or a plurality of arbitrary shells may be interposed between a highly iodide containing shell comprising silver halide grains and an intermediate shell. Such highly iodide containing shells may be provided in such a process as that a desalting step is applied, if necessary, to the resulted inner core or the inner core provided with an arbitrary shell and for example an ordinary halogen substitution process or a silver halide coating process is then applied. The halogen substitution process may be applied in the manner, for example, that, after an inner core is formed, an aqueous solution mainly comprising an iodide compound preferably, potassium iodide , which is preferably not higher than 10 in concentration, is added. This processes are more particularly described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,592,250 and 4,075,020 and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 127549 1980 . For decreasing an iodide distribution difference between the grains of the highly iodide containing shell, it is desired, in this process, to adjust the concentration of an aqueous iodide compound solution to 10 ² mol or lower and then to add the solution by taking a time for not shorter than ten minutes. The processes of newly coating a silver halide over to an inner core include, for example, the so called double jet precipitation process and controlled double jet precipitation process each in which an aqueous halide solution and an aqueous silver nitrate solution are simultaneously added. To be more concrete, the processes are described in detail in, for example, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 22408 1978 and 14829 1983 Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 13162 1968 or Journal of Photographic Science , No. 24,198, 1976. When a highly iodide containing shell is formed, a pAg value is varied in accordance with a reaction temperature and the kinds and the amount of silver halide solvents used. The same conditions as those for the case of the above mentioned inner core are preferably applied to this case. When using ammonia to serve as a solvent, a pAg value is desirably from 7 to 11. Among the processes of forming a highly iodide containing shell, a double jet precipitation process and a controlled double jet precipitation process are preferred more than others. The intermediate shells of the silver halide grains of the invention may be provided in such a manner that a highly iodide containing shell is arranged onto the surface of a grain containing the above mentioned highly iodide containing shells and the inner cores, or, if required, the highly iodide containing shell is provided thereon with a single or plurality of arbitrary shells and, to the outside of the above mentioned grain, a silver halide having a halogen composition different from those of the highly iodide containing shells is further coated in a double jet or controlled double jet precipitation process as examples. The afore mentioned highly iodide containing shell providing process is similarly applied to serve as the above mentioned processes. The outermost shell of the silver halide grains of the invention may be provided in such a manner that an intermediate shell is provided to the surface of a grain containing the above mentioned intermediate shells, the highly iodide containing shells and the inner shell or, if required, the intermediate shell provided thereon with a single or plurality of arbitrary shells and, to the outside of the above mentioned grain, a silver halide having a halogen composition different from those of the highly iodide containing shells is further coated in a double jet or controlled double jet precipitation process as examples for process. The aforementioned highly iodide containing shell providing process is similarly applied to serve as the above mentioned processes. The arbitrary shells may be interposed singly or plurally, if required, between an inner core and a highly iodide containing shell, the highly iodide containing shell and an intermediate shell, and the intermediate shell and the outermost shell, respectively and it is allowed not necessarily to interpose such an arbitrary shell. The above mentioned arbitrary shells may be provided in the same processes as in the case of providing the aforementioned highly iodide containing shell. When trying to provide a shell adjacent to an inner core, a highly iodide containing shell, an outermost shell or arbitrary shells provided to the respective positions, an ordinary desalting may also be carried out in the course of providing the adjacent shell, if required, or such shells may be continuously formed without carrying out any desalting. There may be obtained an iodide content of each coated shell of the silver halide grains of the invention in such a method as described in, for example, J.I. Goldstein and D.B. Williams, X Ray Analyses in TEM ATEM , Scanning Electron Microscopy, 1977, vol. 1, IIT Research Institute, p. 651, March, 1977 Annual Meeting of SPSTJ 84 , p 49 51 1984 The International East West Symposium on the Factors Influencing Photographic Sensitivity 1984 , c 60 c 63 1984 Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 143331 1985 and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 143332. In the silver halide grains which are the final products obtained after the outermost shell of the invention was formed, it is allowed, in the preparation of the grains, to remove an excessive halide which was unnecessarily produced or such a salt or compound as for example a nitrate, or ammonia which was by produced or unnecessarily produced, from the dispersion medium of the grains. The suitable methods of removing the above mentioned materials include, for example, a noodle washing method usually applied to an ordinary type emulsion a dialysis method a sedimentation method utilizing an inorganic salt, an anionic surfactant, such an anionic polymer as a polystyrene sulfonic acid, or such a gelatin derivative as an acylated or carbamoylated gelatin or a flocculation method. The core shell type silver halide grains of the invention can be optically sensitized to a desired wavelength region, and there is no special limitation to the optical sensitization methods. The grains may be optically sensitized by making use, independently or in combination, of such an optical sensitizer as cyanine or merocyanine dyes including, for example, zeromethine, monomethine, dimethine, and trimethine. A combination of spectrally sensitizing dyes is often used particularly for a supersensitization. An emulsion is also allowed to contain, as well as the above mentioned spectrally sensitizing dyes, a dye having no spectrally sensitizing characteristic in itself or a substance substantially incapable of absorbing any visible rays of light but capable of displaying super sensitizing characteristics. These technics are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,688,545, 2,912,329, 3,397,060, 3,615,635 and 3,628,964 British Patent Nos. 1,195,320, 1,242,588 and 1,293,862 West German OLS Patent Nos. 2,030,326 and 2,121,780 Japanese Patent Examined Publication Nos. 4936 1968 and 14030 1969 and Research Disclosure, vol. 176, No. 17643, published in Dec., 1978, p. 23, Paragraph IV, Item J. The above mentioned technics may be optionally selected in accordance with a wavelength region or with sensitivity to which a sensitization is to be applied and with the purpose and use of a light sensitive material. The core shell type silver halide crystals of the invention may also be treated in various chemical sensitization processes applicable to ordinary type emulsions. The chemical sensitization may be carried out in such a process as described in, for example, H. Frieser, Die Grundlagen der Photographische Prozesse mit Silberhalogeniden .

They typically include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,399,083 and 2,448,060 or British Patent No. 618,061. The silver salt grains of the invention may be treated in a combination of not less than two of the above mentioned chemical sensitization processes. An amount of silver to be coated is not limited but preferably from not less than 1000mg m² to not more than 15000mg m² and, more preferably, from not less than 2000mg m² to not more than 10000mg m². The light sensitive layers each containing the above mentioned grains may be present on both sides of a support.
