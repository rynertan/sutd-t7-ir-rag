The coup ling 1 may either be adapted to join one gutter to an adjacent gutter in which case both portions are provided with sockets 8 for receiving the ends of respective gutters, or alternatively one of the portions 3 may include a free end in the configura tion of a gutter for connection to another component of the system.
