# Nuclear steam generator wrapper and shell assembly and method for assembling.

## Abstract
A nuclear steam generator modularized wrapper as sembly comprising at least two separate generally cylin drical wrapper modules 24, 42 with tube support plates 28 therewithin are assembled in stacked relation and joined within a nuclear containment building 34 . The assembled modules are then placed in the steam generator shell 38 with the apertures in the tube support plates 24 being aligned with the apertures in the tube sheet 56 . A plurality of adjustable spacers 74 fixed to the outer circumference of the wrapper assembly 24, 42 are pro vided and are adjusted to vary the width of the space in the annulus between the wrapper and shell at various loca tions to lock the assembly in place with axial alignment of all of the apertures in the tube support plates 24, 42 and tube sheet 56 . The invention facilitates replacement of the wrapper and tube support plates so as to permit exchange of the heat transfer tubes of a nuclear steam generator within the reactor containment.
