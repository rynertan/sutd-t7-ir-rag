## Description
System for the antomatic production of graphic music originals . The invention concerns a system of the ant omatic production of graphic music original. to be used for. the printed reprodiction of the so called music .scores in a high number of co pies. In view of its use a music original must naturally be graphically perfect in cach of ist own parts, i.e. in muical signs, in special signs and the accompanying alphanumerical indications altogether. The writing of music originals is presently done mostly by using one or more of the following manual methods 1 Cutting by punching of metallic surfaces matrixes 2 Use of transfers, that is signs pre printed on a support which are transferred by pressure 3 Drawing free hand, or with the help of masks. Such methods are so primitive to require highly specialized personnel. It follows that the writing of even simple rmisic originals involves excessive costs and difficulties deriving from frequent rteouches and remakes. Recently semi automatic systems have been introduced that allow the writing of music originals reducing the enormous difficulties involved in the manual techniques. A first type of semi automatic system consists in a piano or organ keyboard connected to a comptlter. The aconstic signals sent by the organ are analyzed and 1 physical characteristies frequency, phase, duration, etc. are extracted an alphanumerical keyboard introdnees in the. computer the complementary information and the instruc ions needed by the computer. Seeondly, the computer processes the memorized information and executes the mlsic original through a peripheral graphic output unit plotter . The disadvantage of this system comes from its too high difficulty of utilization, since the piano keyboard operator first be an accomplished musician in order to perform the musical piece whose score is wanted. Besides, the musician who plays the keyboard must perform to perfection as far as the duration of the sound is concerned otherwise the computer, in dubious cases, will makes choices that won t always be the expected ones. For these reasons this system is still experimental, and cannot be employed industrially. A second semi automatic system consists in an electric typewriter including eight vertical spaces which allow the positioning of notes within an octave without having to move the paper sheet. This system acts as a mere help to the previously mentioned manual techniques, as it only permits the writing of the nn.rt recurrent signs, without achieving the flexibility needed by an automatic system. Ptlrpose of the present invention is to realize a system for the production of music originals having the following characteristies 1 it must be simple to use, and not require special musical knowledge from the user 2 it must be comparatively unexpensive 3 it must be especially flexible in the sense that it must allow the introduction of new graphic signs and special symbols as required by the new techniques of modern music. Such purpose is reatlized by the present invention through a system for the automatic production of graphic music origipals, formed by a microcomputer consisting of a central proces and unit and a memory system for the memorization of data and programs and a set of peripheral input and output units, characterized in that one of said peripheral input units consists of a touch sensitive organ and of a contact unit physically associable with different areas of said sensitive unit, sijch sensitive unit including a first area apt to the sllpport of a music sheet for the selection of the co ordinates of the rinisical graphic signs to be introduced in the music original, and a second area for the selection of said musical graphic signs and associated instructions. One practical realization of the system according to the invention is described in detail hereunder, just as an example, with reference to the enclosed drawings where Fig. 1 represents the block diagram of a system according to the invention Fig. 2 represents a graphic inplt tablet digitizer , which is purt of said system Fig. 3 represents an example of musical graphic symbols with associated instructions, to be used in the tablet of Fig.2 Figs. 4 7 show some examples of representations of sigle notes, chords and groups of notes with chord. The system for the automatic production of originals reprevented in Fig. 1 consists of an electronic processor microeom ptiter 100 consisting of central processing unit CPU 1, a memory unit RAM 2, a read only memory EPROM 3 and a memory channel 4 to it are connected peripheral units 6 to 12 connected toCPU 1 through an input output channe 5. The mentioned microcomputer is, in general terms, of the tylxw icriown in the art of personal compters and, more specificaily, the one produced by Mostek Corporation can be employed. described in the manual titled Zb0 Microcomplter systems FIJ 0D X Flexible Disk Operating System V 2.1 PublicationNo. MK78557. May 1979 . In said manual are described details of the Operative System, which includes a Monitor and a set of programs. Peripheral units 6 to 12 are also known in the art, being employed mainly in the scientific technical field. They are a graphic printer 6, a plotter 7, an input graphic tablet 8 digitizer , a graphic video 9, an alphanumerical keyboard 10, and finally a couple of flexible disk units floppy disk 11 and 12, which constitute the mass memory. Peripheral graphic units which can be used for the system, according to the invention are for example Graphic terminal WB 5 produced by Effegi DATA Italy Plotter BENSON 1201 Graphic tablet Digitizer CALCOMP series 600 or 800. The CPU limit 1, togethe with RAM 2 and EPROM 3, allows he microcompoter s operative system DOS to operate the whole system including peripheral units 6 to 12. The system according to tlie invention employs a second operative system of musical typx MELOS which will be subscquently deseribed like digitizer b Flg. 2 includes a sensitive surface 21, can ying a number of musical graphic information, and a special sensitive pen 20 referred to from now on as stylus , or other equivalent sensor, capable of converting said graphic information into numerical information representing the co ordinates x, y of the point of sensitive surface 21, which is each time indicated by stylus 20. The co oldinates indicated by stylus 20 can be memorized in iiijmerical form on the magnetic support floppy disk of peripheral units 11 12. Since During the writing of a musical page input it is n . ssary to specify both type of sign and position, sensitive surface 21 is divided into two areas a centrai area 16, defined by rectangle 17, reserved to the musie sheet featuring a number of pentagrams on which the co ordinates of the musical signs to be introduced into the sy st m are to be indicated a peripheral area 18, including a series of sensitive areas 10 corresponding to respective musical graphic signs and instructions. A non limitative example of graphic signs and instrllctions which can be inserted in area 18 of the graphic tablet 8 is given in Fig. 3 and includes elementary graphic signs 22, complex graphic signs 23 and instructions 24. the elen ntary graphic sins 22 consist of musical symbols of single note 22A, pause symbols 22B, symbols of clef 22C, symbols of alteration 22D and various other special symbols 221. The complex graphic sins 23 consist of musical symbols of trill 2.A, of ligature 23B, of crescendo diminuendo 23C. Finally, instructions 24 are representative of associated logical functions, identified by the following initials EN End operationIL Start line 0R1 Origin of pentagram Heigtit of pentagram LAR Widih of pentagram Delete last instruction set 114 Start har FBt End bar.

The flexible discs magnetic units 11 and 12 from now on referred to simply as floppy disks serve the purpose of memorizing the co ordinates x, y and the codes of graphic signs 22, 23 and of instructions 24 introduced by stylus 20. The high resolution peripheral graphic unit plotter 7 is employed by CPO 1 to control the writing of the imisic origi nal. CPU 1 will employ to this purpose the information introciti ced in floppy disks 11 and 12 through the digitizer 8. obvioii sly plotter 7 can bt replaced by an output unit of photographie type. Graphic video 9 is employed for the visualization of notes and music signs as they are fed in by the operator. This imme diate check of the music introduced allows the correction of errors as soon as they are made, thus simplifying the produc tri on process of the originals. Alphanumerical keyboard 10 allows the introchiction of in strtictions relevant to the operative system described in the publication mentioned earlier and to the musical operative system MELOS besides it also serves the purpose of answering the messages that bot of these operative systems send to the operator on graphic video 9. Graphic printer 6 is employed for the production of proofs of the nwlsic originals, as being faster and less accurate than plotter 7, it allows to check rapidly whether the work introduced is correct or requires modifications. As previotisly said, the system according to the invention employs an operative system of conventional type plus a second musical operative system called MELOS. The latter is assigned to the recording of the musical data and to this end it is t to accept the following operative instructions, introduced through the alphanumerical keyboard 10 EX starts the research of the appropriate recording space in the floppy disk chosen for such operationCO executes the copy of a record from one floppy disk to the other t creates in the floppy disk the organization suitable for the CR rocoding of a number of music pages forming a tixisical work.This ordur must come befor the Ex command beford starting a new work it allows to visulaize and modify the exocuted recording .91 visualizes the status of a work, giving its over all data mumber of pages written, number of pages deleted and so on EN causes the machine to pass under the control of the mll.si cal operative system MELOSRE orders the reading, page by page, of a musical work and controls it printing or its visualization on the periphe ral unit selected graphic video 9, plotter 9, graphic printer 6 . There follows the following way of operating of the machine according to the present invention, ensured by the linking of the MELONS operative masical system to the DOS operative system. Firstly, the operator lays and secures an empty mllsic shcet on area 16 of tablet 21. The operator then sets on keyboard 10 the order of start work CR, followed by the order of reScarch EX. The recording of a music page can now start, effected throu stylus 20 and tablet 21. More precisely, when the operator lays stylus 20 on a certain point of the central area 16 of tablet 21, an electric signal is generated representative of the corresponding co ordinates of the pentagram, which is received and memorized by the microcomputer 100. When instead the stylus 20 is laid on a sensitive area 19 of peripheral area 18 of the tablet, an electric signal is generated which represents a imi.ica1 symbol 22, 23, or an instruction 24. Proceeding this wav, the various musical notes are recorded one at a time or in grotips on the floppy disk prepared to receive them. Natti rally, the sequence of operations executed through stylus 20 and tablet 21 will be different according to whether it is rqtiir ed to record single notes or chords, groups of notes and so on As an example, if it is desired to record one single note, like the on shown in Fig. 4, it is necessary to press stylus 20 on the symbol 22A of area 18 of tablet 21 and subsequently on the spot of the appropriate co ordinates x, y of area 16 of the same tablet.In case such note had a bar of non standard size, it is then necessary to select in the following order through stylus 20 the DIM order 24 in Fig. 3 , the symbol of the desired duration 22B , the position of end of bar A and the position of the note B . If it was instead wanted to record a chord i.e. a number of notes played simultaneously and therefore on one vertical bar like the one shown in Fig. 5,the first note B is written by following the procedure explained earlier for the non standard note, and then the positions of the other notes C, D are introduced following to the operation of order ACC. By doingSo, all notes result with the same horizontal position. Eventual overlapping of notes is automatically avoided by the operative system MELOS, shich takes care of shifting one or more notes to the opposite part of the vertical bar, as illustrated in Fig. 6. lt is also possible to record a group of notes with a chord, as the one shown in Fig. 7. In this case, the order of start group 1G is given through stylus 208 then the co ordinates of points A and B are introduced. Follows the introduction of the chruation code, then the positions of the notes C, D, E of the chord, then again the sharp symbol F by selecting by st yltjs 20 the corresponding symbol and the relevant co ordi nates. Subsequently the notes which follow are introdticed int ro ducing before each of them the relevant duration sign. Finally, the group is closed by the oder FG.The MELOS OPERATIVE system then generates automatically, during the reproduction phase, both the stanting bar between points A and B of Fig. 7 and the parallel lines between the intermediate notes by employing t this purpose suitable graphic functions with which it is equip ped. Other complex symbols, like the trill, the ligatures and the crescendo diminuendos, can be also introduced and memorized through .simple procedures, always consisting in the appropriate coupling of co ordinates, graphic signs 22, 23 and instructions 24. all selected through stylus 20. It is also foreseen that the procedures that have just been described for the single notes, chords and groups of notes can undergo variations without getting out of the limit.s of the present invention. Having this way been executed the recording of one music page, and before going on to the recording of the following page, it ih possible to visualize the introduced page through graphic video 9 or graphic printer 6, so as to correct the mi mist a kes which milt have occurred. The visualization is obtained Iw giving the signal ED through keyboard 10. Having completed the recording of the whole sequence of pages i.e. of the complete musical work, it is now possible to obtain the airtomatic writing of the music original in technically perfect form by plotter 7 or other equivalent periptheral unit . The relevant order RE is given through keyboard 10 and gives access to the floppy disk for the reading and reproduetion of one music page at a time. The musical information contained in each page line are analyzed sequentially. I i each sign to be printed, simple or complex, the position x, y is employed to cause the shift of the pen nib of plotter 7 from the actual position to the starting position of the sign to be drawn. The code of the sign is used to have access to ti corresponding graphic routine.
