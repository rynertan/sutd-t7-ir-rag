# Gaseous discharge display device.

## Abstract
A high resolution gaseous discharge display and or memory device 21 comprises a panel array of bistable charge storage areas designated gaseous discharge cells or sites, each cell having an associated pair of coordinate orthogonal conductors 23A 23N and 25A 25N defining the cell walls which, when appropriately energized, produce a confined gaseous discharge in the selected sites. The conductors 23A 23N and 25A 25N are insulated from direct contact with the gas by a dielectric insulator 33,35,39,41 the dielectric insulator 39,41 being composed of a layer of refractory material having high secondary emission characteristics such as a Group IIA oxide doped with a Group IA element to prevent degradation of the dielectric during operation, to increase the static margin of the panel and improve the stability of the maximum and minimum sustain voltages, thereby providing stable operating voltages and extending the life of the gaseous discharge display panel. Other embodiments of the dielectric insulator utilize additional small concentrations of elements of Groups VIII or VIB with the above concentration.
