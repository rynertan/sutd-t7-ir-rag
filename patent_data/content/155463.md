# Scintillator detector for event related grouping.

## Abstract
A gamma camera is provided with a bidirectional switching network between each of its photomultiplier tubes and its surrounding tubes, such that each tube may inform its neighboring tubes when it has acquired a scintillation event. All of those tubes which have so acquired a scintilla tion event are then treated as a cluster with one of the tubes acting as a coordinator for the entire cluster. Provision is made for validation of the signals within the cluster, and the outputs of the individual photomultiplier tubes within the cluster are then synchronously and collectively applied to the signal processing circuitry for display. In this way, it is possible to process plural valid events which occur simul taneously to thereby increase both the current rate and the validity rate of an anger type system.
