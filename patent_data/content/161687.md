# Cooling system for automotive engine.

## Abstract
In order control the boiling point of the coolant in an en gine wherein the coolant is boiled and the vapor used as a vehicle for removing heat, a the amount of liquid coolant retained in a radiator in which the vapor is condensed to its liquid form, is controlled to determine the radiator surface area available for the vapor to release its latent heat and b the cooling assistance provided by a fan is regulated. With this arrangement course temperature control is provided by controlling the amount of coolant in the radiator while finer control is provided by controlling the fan.
