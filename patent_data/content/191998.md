# Process for preparing facetted nodular particles and isotropic magnetic recording elements containing such particles.

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to a process for preparing facetted nodular particles of alpha ferric oxide hydrate consisting a in adding an aqueous solution of ferrous salt to an aqueous solution of alkaline hydroxide, while avoiding substantially any local excess of ferrous salt and submitting the ferrous salt solution to reducing conditions before or during the addition thereof to the alkaline hydroxide solu tion, in order to reduce into ferrous ions the ferric ions that contaminate said ferrous salt solution, and b in oxidizing the ferrous hydroxide particles of the resulting aqueous dispersion of ferrous hydroxide particles, in order to form alpha ferric oxide hydrate particles. An iron selective com plexing agent is introduced into the reaction medium, which is capable of selectively forming ferric iron complexes soluble under the pH alkaline conditions of the reaction medium. High performance isotropic magnetic recording ele ments containing magnetic nodular particles obtained from facetted nodular particles of alpha ferric oxide hydrate are also disclosed.
