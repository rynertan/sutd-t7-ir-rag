# Frame for the support and winding of sun awning shapers and rollers.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a frame for the support of large sun awning shapers and rollers that houses internally the sliding rollers at the ends of the said rods which can be drawn back together with the awning they subtend. In this way the balcony remains free of all lateral rods, apart from the stiffeners located on the curved part of the supports which constitute the invention. These are charac terized by their configuration as slideways of varying num ber and width, for the presence of grip blocks to stop the moving rollers and for the unique type of joint between the section of the frame.

## Description
FRAME FOR THE SUPPORT AND WINDING OF SUN AWNINGSHAPERS AND ROLLERS.This invention relates to a side and or central support frame for sun awnings whose considerable surface area necessitates the use of transverse shapers and sliders to keep the awning correctly extended when in use, and to draw it back and store it compactly according to the demands of insolation.This necessitates a series of runways machined into the frame enabling the ends of the transverse rods to slide for the whole lenght of the supports, avoiding interference in the movement usually mechanized on the part of the subtended awning.With reference to the present state of the technology we can claim that though there are numerous examples of this type of frames both fixed and extendible, all have the common characteristic of more than one transverse stiffening bar. The presence of such fixed transverse elements causes problems bith from an operational and from an aesthetic point of view it hampers the lowering of the awning and causes an unaesthetic bulge where the awning passes over the transverse elements, and in the drawn back position reveals the unaesthetic metal cross bars now not covered by the multicoloured awning.The object of the present invention is to eliminate to a great extent the problems cited above and others, through the use of a device that, by means of a series of mobile, hidden transverse bars, makes it possible to achieve perfect tension throughout the awning, even at the bend in the frame at which point the only fixed double stiffening bar is located. In this construction it was preferred to retain the fixed double stiffening bar because of the considerable distance between the arms in another construction specifically designed for small awnings subject of our previous patent , however, this bas is mobile as well.This invention provides a solution to the above problems in that it is formed of two side girders, to which further central girders are sometimes added, of inverted L t shape, fixed at one end to the floor and at the other to the facade of the balcony that is to be covered by the awning.In this way a kind of frame is created, connected by a ridgepole located on the vertex of the L , upon which the sun awning is extended, suitably held, supported and motorized by a series of mobile transverse elements which disappear from view when the awning is drawn back and stored at its upper endThe mechanical solution devised in order to attain this end consists of the use of an original slide guide shaped so as to house the ends of the transverse bars, and of a series of accessories that allow these transverse bars to support and wind the sun awning in a manner both mechanically and aesthetically perfect.The slide guide, produced in two versions, single or multiple, to be placed at either side of the awning or, should its size be sufficient to require it, also in the centre, consists of an extruded metal section with an overall rectangular cross section, cut into sections connected in an original manner so as to form piers and ridge of the semiportal fixed to the supporting wall and to the floor.With reference to the double sided section for use in the centre of the awning, which has slideways on both left and right rather than on only one side as in the single section from the front elevation , proceeding from the top downwards, we can list a series of openings of different shapes corresponding to the required use.The first internal channel serves to house the brake blocks, the one nearest the autside serves as a guide for the small slide wheels, whose centre pin is constrained by the blocks described in present positions.The channel machined into the lower part of the section has various uses depending on requirements it may be used to house the keep blocks for the fixed transverse element, or the supports for the same it may house the plates for the mechanized winding roller or serve as a pairing channel for more than one motorized tube it can also serve as a support for moveable glass walls that are fixed to this channel in certain uses.In the case of the lower guide channel in the single section, this may also serve as a slide for the sheaves that support the vertical awning side walls.The M shaped centre hole serves to house the joint elements that link the ridgepole and the piers securely together by means of a corner piece. The equipment at this particular point is equally original. The double hinged joint with a plate on one end, access to which is through an opening made in the section, which forms a ledge against the shim of the section, allows the joint centre to be put under tension by screwing down the nut that passes through the plate, thus clamping the parts ridgepole, pier and corner piece.The fixed transverse elements support is located on the corner piece, remaining clear of the section and thus allowing the easy movement of the originally conceived banked saddle which carries the characteristic end tube, to which the awning is fixed in this way the awning is able to slide over all obstacles, remaining perfectly taught.These and other objects and advantages will now be described in greater details using a simple example of the device which is however intended to be purely illustrative and does not limit in any way the scope of this patent, with reference to the drawings in which Fig. 1 Table 1 gives an overall view of the frame.Figs. 2 and 3 Table 2 show a cross section of the single snd double sections.Fig. 4 Table 3 shows the detail of the banked saddle and the end tube carrying the awning.Fig. 5 Table 4 shows a detail of the joint device double mounted inside the double section.In these drawings 1 indicates the section that functions as a pier. 2 indicates the angle element, 3 the ridge section. 4 indicates the fixed trasverse elements, 5 a mobile transverse bar, 6 the end tube that carries the awning 7, carried in its turn by the banked saddle 8 that, as a result of its particular configuration and that of the supports 9 of the fixed transverse elements, passes over them keeping the awning always perfectly taught. 10 indicates the commercial, motorized winding rollers that wind the awning up and down by means of the belts 11.In Table 2, 12 indicates the upper internal guide, for the blocks 13 14 indicates the upper external guide for the slide wheels 15 16 indicates the centre pin whose end 17 comes into contact with the restraint at the end of its travel, thus stopping the mobile transverse bar 5 . 18 indicates the guide for the blocks 13 , to fix firmly the pin of a fixed transverse element 10 19 indicates the external channel of the single section for housing any sheaves for vertical awning sides, and 20 indicates the opening of the housing of one or two clamping devices. In Table 3, the wheels of the saddles are shown as 21, while 22 indicates the raised section of the same, which houses, in the rail provided 23, the lower part shaped accordingly 24 of the end tube 6 25 indicates the circular cavities that enable the end limb of the awning 26 to be held by the rod 27 in different positions. In Table 4, 28 indicates the access hole to the nut 29 passing through the plate 30 that contacts the shim 31 of the section, allowing in this way the apparatus to be put under tension. 32 indicates the first part of the joint assembly, 33 the second and 34 the third 35 shows the hinge of the same.In practice details of assembly, dimensions, materials and the shape and otherwise of the invention may vary without, however, falling outside the scope of the present patent. Indeed, as conceived, the invention is open to numerous modifications and variations all of which lie within the concept of the invention.Furthermore, all the parts may be substituted by other, technically similar components.
