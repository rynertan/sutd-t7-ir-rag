# APPARATUS FOR TRIMMING ARTICLES MOLDINGLY FORMED ON PLASTIC SHEET

## Abstract
Apparatus for longitudinally and transversely trimming articles C I , C II moldingly formed on plastic sheet b which is brought by means of a pair of clamp chains 10 between longitudinally movable pointed tip knives 51 and longitudinally extended holder members 61 as well as transversely movable pointed tip knives 31 and transverse ly extended holder member 41 respectively held in re tracted position and then trimmed by moving said knives and holder members to forwarded position and by moving said knives. Said sheet b is formed in advance with transversely and longitudinally extended ridges XR, YR so that said moving knives cannot sever the sheet at said ridges, whereby trimmed articles fall down by gravity and waste portion kept in one piece is brought out by said clamp chains to be collected. In order to attain correct trimming, said sheet b is formed in advance further with additional transversely and longitudinally extended ridges XR, XRâ‚‚, YR, YR , YR respectively beside and in parallel with lines to be severed so that each rib 310, 510 mounted beside the concerned knife 31, 51 and extended in parallel with the knife moving direction fits in the concerned additional ridge of the sheet from the reverse side.
