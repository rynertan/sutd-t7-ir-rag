# Sample spinning mechanism for NMR probes.

## Abstract
An NMR spectrometer has an air bearing supported turbine comprising a rotor 30 having a frusto conical shaped member 34 and a cylindrical portion 33 . A stator 35 houses said rotor and has a tapered portion 36 for receiving said frusto conical rotor portion and a cylindrical portion for receiving the cylindrical portion, together with a first set of jets 39 in the tapered portion for levitating the rotor and a second set of jets 41 in the cylindrical portion for maintaining alignment of the rotor axis with the axis of the cylindrical portion. The rotor has means 34 min for deriving rotational motion from at least one of said set of jets and means 46, 46 min are provided for maintaining different gas pressures at the respective set of jets.
