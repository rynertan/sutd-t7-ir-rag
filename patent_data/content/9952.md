# Production of detergent compositions.

## Abstract
Particulate alkaline detergent compositions for fabric washing, which include synthetic detergent compounds and alkali metal tripolyphosphate and alkali metal orthophos phate detergency builders, are made by spray drying a detergent base powder containing some or all of the detergent compounds and some or all of the orthophosphate and amixing at least 2.5 by weight of the tripolyphosphate in particulate form with the spray dried base powder.
