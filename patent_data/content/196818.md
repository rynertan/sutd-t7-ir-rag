# Coating billets for forging.

## Abstract
To forge billets, the billets 14 are fed end to end along a path which leads to a coating tank 30 containing a lubricant end thence through a heating station 10 to a forging station 12 . Within the coating tank, the line of billets is made to undergo a change of direction for example by passing over a hump in the feed path, such that an angular separation is created between adjacent end faces of succes sive billets. In this way, a better coating of the end faces of the billets is achieved. the hump in the feed path may be produced by locating a roller 22 in the feed path immediate ly before the coating tank with its uppermost point above the plane of the preceding portion 16 of the feed path.
