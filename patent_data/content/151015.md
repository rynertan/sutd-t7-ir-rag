# APPARATUS FOR SENSING STRAIN IN A TRANSPARENT FIBRE

## Abstract
The strain in an optical fibre 3 drawn from a furnace 1 before passing into a coating bath 5 is measured using an optical beam from a laser 6 which is caused to intercept the fibre. The polarisation which may initially be linear or cir cular, is changed during passage through the fibre by an amount dependent on strain. The components of the emerg ing beam polarised in planes P1 and P2 are separated by a beam splitter 8, detected at D1 and D2 and compared at 9 to give a measure of the change in polarisation and therefore a measure of strain. The maximum output of the comparator 9 is calculated at 10 so as to ensure that the final output at 1A is not affected by occasions when the laser beam passes to one side of the fibre 3 rather than throug it. Vibration of the fibre 3 and of the mirror 7 ensures that the beam passes through the fibre at least some of the time. In an alternative system Figure 4 the mirror 7 is omitted. Instead the laser 6 and detectors D1 and D2 are mounted on a reciprocating platform.
