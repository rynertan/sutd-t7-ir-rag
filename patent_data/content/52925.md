## Description
METHOD AND PLANT FOR TREATING GRANULAR OR PULVEROUS RAW MATERIAL. The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for burning granular or pulverous raw material for instance cement raw material. For many years manufacture of cement and the like has preferentially taken place in kiln plant including a rotary kiln allowing for, compared with shaft kilns, a continuous treatment of raw materials fed to the plant.The development of such rotary kiln plant has through recent times undergone a change towards reducing the size of the mechanically rather complicated kiln construction by arranging some of the previous functions of the rotary kiln to take place in stationary parts of the plant such as separate preheating and precalcining installations. Such plants are known for example fromBritish Patent Specifications Nos. 1,108,589, 1,454,091 and 1,428,828 according to which the rotary kiln carries out two functions in addition to the transport function of treated materials, namely heating from about 9000C to the reaction temperature in the kiln of the material precalcined in the precalcination zone, and providing retention time in the kiln for the reacting material under treatment. The next logical step in this development is to move the heating function from the rotary kiln out into a separate, stationary installation thereby making it possible to reduce further the functions of the rotating plant installation. This reduction is attractive due to less overall construction costs and better running economy of the plant. A plant of this type is known from German OLS 2,846,584. However, the problem of moving the heating function to a stationary installation may be encumbered by the melting of say up to 20 of the material, which melting may make the charge stick and clog and therefore difficult to handle during further treatment in the plant. It is therefore the object of the invention to devise a method and a kiln plant where the heating of the treated material to its reaction temperature takes place in a stationary burning installation and where the above mentioned problem concerning transportation of treated material in the plant is mitigated. According to the present invention, a method of treating granular or pulverous raw. material, e.g. cement raw material, comprises preheating and precalcining the raw material in suspension separating the precalcined material from smoke gases providing two separate subsidiary flows of the precalcined material feeding one of the subsidiary flows to a stationary burning chamber for burning in suspension and at least partial melting of the material separating this material from smoke gases and feeding it to a nodulising zone feeding the other subsidiary material flow to the nodulising zone and mixing it with the material from the burning chamber whereby the mixed material is subjected to a final reaction and nodulisation during its retention in the nodulising zone and feeding the material from the nodulising zone to a cooler. The invention also includes a plant for carrying out this method, the plant being characterised by means for preheating and precalcining the raw material, means for providing the two separate subsidiary material flows, means for leading the one subsidiary flow to a stationary burning chamber, means for separating this material from smoke gases and feeding it to a rotating nodulisation chamber, means for leading the other subsidiary flow directly to the nodulisation chamber for mixing with the material from the burning chamber, and means for leading the nodulised product from the nodulisation chamber to a cooler. After the treatment in a preheating zone for preheating the material, and in a precalcination zone for removal of carbon dioxide from the material, the material is separated and part fed to a reaction zone in a stationary burning chamber where significant burning of the material in suspension and melting takes place.Thereafter the at least partly melted material is separa ted from the hot gases and fed to a nodulising zone, preferably a rotating nodulising drum. The at least partly melted material may be mixed with other precalcined material either in or immediately before entering the nodulising zone. Powdery precalcined material fed directly to the nodulising zone coats the melted material particles so that the problem of sticking or clogging is mitigated. The mixture then undergoes a final reaction during its retention in the nodulising zone, the overall temperature of the mixture ensuring that the finished reaction including the nodulisation can preferably take place without the supply of any other heat to the nodulising zone other than that already contained in the material supplied thereto.The primary source of heat for determining the overall temperature of the mixture is the temperature of the partial flow coming from the burning chamber which emits sufficient heat in the nodulising zone to give the mixture of the two flows a reaction temperature of typically 1400 15000 C. The retention time of the material in the nodulising zone will allow for the final reaction of the mixture. With this method and apparatus, it is possible to transport each of the two partial flows entirely through stationary plant installations as far as the nodulising zone, while movement of the mixture through the nodulising zone, which forms the so called sticking temperature area, prevents any significant clogging. The nodulising zone may impart a rotary component to the mixture to assist transportation of the mixture through the zone and, furthermore the nodulising zone may be provided by a very short rotary kiln which may be usedin some cases to maintain the reaction temperature. The one material flow is preferably suspended in spent cooling air when fed to the burning chamber. The stationary burning chamber may be a shaft like chamber, or a cyclone burner. In the latter case, the cyclone burner will act both as the burning chamber and as the separator in which the burnt material is separated from the smoke gases before being fed to the nodulising zone.The smoke gases from which the burnt material is separated before being fed to the nodulizing zone, is preferably fed to the precalcination zone for use as combustion air where it is used to assist in precalcining further raw material. Pipes feeding spent cooling air from the cooler to the burning chamber and or the precalciner, may be provided with movable dampers for regulating the gas streams. The preheated and precalcined material may be divided into the two subsidiary material flows by the use for example of a splitting gate. Alternatively, the two subsidiary flows may be provided by the use of a two string preheater and precalciner working in parallel. Two examples of a method and apparatus in accordance with the present invention are illustrated in the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which Figure 1 shows one example with the reaction zone provided by a shaft like chamber and, Figure 2 shows another example with a reaction zone provided by a cyclone burner. In the figures the same reference numerals are used for identical parts of the apparatus. Raw material is fed to a preheater installation 1 at an inlet 2. Preheated material leaves the preheater via a pipe 11 and is fed to a precalciner 3, directly and or via a pipe Ila and a riser pipe 16. Fuel is fed at 15 to the precalciner 3 and combustion air is supplied through the pipe 16 and a pipe 18. Precalcined material leaves the precalciner 3 in suspension via pipe 10 and is separated from hot smoke gases in a separator 4. The hot smoke gases are fed to the preheater installation 1 via a pipe 9 and drawn through the preheater by a fan 24 in an exhaust pipe 23. Separated, precalcined material is, at a splitting gate 12 immediately after the separator 4, divided into two subsidiary flows. One of these flows, amounting to 25 75 of the total is, via a pipe 13, led to the pipe 18 for suspension in spent cooling air from a cooler 8.The suspension is fed to a vertical, tubular or shaft like burning or reaction chamber 6 Figure 1 for burning and melting the material, the chamber having fuel inlets and burners 19. Melted material and smoke gases leave the reaction chamber 6 through a pipe 20 leading to a cyclone 5 in which the melt is separated from the smoke gases. The latter are fed as hot combustion air to the precalciner 3 via the pipe 16 as mentioned above, whereas the melt, via a pipe 17, is fed to a rotating nodulisation drum 7. The other subsidiary, precalcined, powdery material flow, amounting to 75 25 of the total is, via the splitting gate 12 and a pipe 14, fed directly to the inlet of the drum 7 to be mixed in the drum with the melt.This mixing prevents the risk of sticking and clogging of the melt during its treatment in the drum 7 and the heat proper contained in the melt and in the subsidiary second material flow respectively ensures that the final reaction in the form of nodulisation of the product in the drum 7 takes place. The product leaves the drum 7 through a pipe 21 and is fed to the cooler 8, from which it leaves as the final product at 22. In the example shown in Figure 2 the reaction zone for burning and melting the treated material is a cyclone burner 60 instead of the shaft like chamber 6. The cyclone burner 60 has a fuel inlet and a burner install, ation 61, and precalcined material to be treated in the reaction zone is fed to an upper part 50 of the pipe 18 for suspension here in spent cooling air from the cooler 8 before being fed to the cyclone burner 60. Also, in this case the spent cooling air acts as combustion air both in the cyclone burner 60and in the precalciner 3 to which it is led directly through a pipe 18a. Movable dampers 25 and 26 are used for regulating the combustion air supply to the reaction zone 6,50, and the precalciner 3.
