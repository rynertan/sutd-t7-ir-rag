# Color picture projection system.

## Abstract
A color picture projection system is described in which the pictures formed by a plurality of, in principle monochrome, picture display tubes are superimposed on a projection screen by means of chromatic projection lens systems. At least one of the reflectors in the color channels, which reflectors fold the radiation path, is a wavelength selective reflector. This ensures that undesired images of different colors are not transmitted by the projection system.
