# Complementary metal oxide semiconductor integrated circuit device of master slice type.

## Abstract
A complementary metal oxide semiconductor master slice integrated circuit comprises a plurality of basic cells 41, 141 42, 142 ... in an internal functional gate region 22 , each basic cell, which is a basic repetition unit, including a single D channel metal oxide semiconductor 41, 42, ... and a single N channel metal oxide semiconductor 141, 142, ... which are disposed linearly with respect to each other through an electrical isolation region. The plurality of basic cells are equi distantly disposed in parallel in a traverse direction of the inter nal functional gate region 22 , without disposing any electrical isolation regions between the basic cells, so that the positions 101 108, 91 98 where longitudinal wirings are to be placed in a wiring zone 31, 32 correspond to the basic cells in a one to one manner. An electrical isolation between a plurality of logical gates structured in the internal functional region is achieved by applying a relatively positive voltage potential and a relatively negative potential to a P channel metal oxide semi conductor and an N channel metal oxide semiconductor in cluded in the basic cells, respectively. Two metal oxide semi conductors included in a basic cell are used as a complementa ry metal oxide semiconductor by connecting them in a com plementary manner, as necessary.
