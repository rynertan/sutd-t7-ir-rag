# BICURVE LENSES

## Abstract
At least one surface of a lens has a double curve with a sur face discontinuity ar the optical axis. A number of combina tions of surfaces are possible such as the bicurve convexo lens of Figure 1a. Bicurve lenses may be used to provide a greater light capture and depth of field than conventional lenses with reduced sperical aberration. Because an annular focus is produced, bicurve lenses may be used with a diaphragm which exands radially from the optical axis to stop the lens, this ar rangement being more compact than conventional aperture ad justing devices.
