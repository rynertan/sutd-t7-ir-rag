# Toroidal motor pump.

## Abstract
Toroidal motor pump comprising a toroidal cilindrical casing 12 with a disc rotor 13 containing rotatably mounted vanes 6,7,8 which are able to seal off the cilinder, wherein on the shaft of the vanes rockers 12,13,14 are fixed which during rotation of the motor pump cooperate with a curved disc, which casing possesses a restricted section in the shape of the disc rotor through which the vanes in closed position are able to pass, as well as an inlet and outlet port for a pressure medium in the section wherein the vanes are rotating as illustrated in figure 1. To guarantee a smooth working between the casing halves and the disc rotor two complementary twin axially curved discs are arranged between which the rockers are running, said rockers having the general shape of a central cam with two side cams so that they are able to move through the disc rotor. The restriction is so constructed that the vane in its passing position is not turned a complete 90 , but about 85 .
