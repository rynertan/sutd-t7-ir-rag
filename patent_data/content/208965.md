# PROCESS FOR RECOVERING OIL FROM RAW OIL SHALE USING ADDED PULVERIZED COAL

## Abstract
A continuous process for recovering oil from raw oil shale using a new integrated hydropyrolysis thermal pyrolysis tech nique and involving the addition of pulverized coal which pro duces oil which is more characteristic of typical crude oil, as well as providing supplemental gas and coal char fuel, and has unusually low heat and energy requirements, which process comprises passing hot and crushed raw shale to a slurry mixer where it is mixed with hot recycle heavy oil, treating the result ing slurry with hydrogen under elevated temperature and press ure for a short period, discharging the resulting mixture to a product stripper wherein the product hydrocarbons and a por tion of the recycle slurry oil is vaporized and passed to a separ ation column where the desired fractions are removed and heavy gas oil recovered for recycle, mixing a portion of the heavy gas oil recycle with pulverized coal particles to form a pumpable coal slurry, discharging spent shale and remaining slurry oil from the product stripper to a thermal retort operated under fluidized bed conditions wherein a temperature gradient is maintained by introducing spent shale and coal char that has been burned in an air lift combustor into at least two different treatment zones, the upper zone being selected such that the temperature is sufficient to vaporize the remaining slurry oil, and the lower zone being selected such that the temperature is sufficient to thermally retort spent shale, pyrolyze coal and thermally crack excess heavy gas oil charged to the lower zone as a coal slurry, taking the product as high temperature vapor to a quench tower wherein the liquid product is recycled to the hydrogenation reactor and the heavy gas oil is recycled to the slurry mixer.
