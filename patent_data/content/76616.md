# LOAD CELL WITH OVERLOAD PROTECTION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A load cell 10 having a self contained overload protec tion system 9 for preventing the load cell 10 from being loaded beyond its rated capacity, wherein the load cell 10 includes fixed 20 and movable 21 end constraints held in spaced relation by upper 22 and lower 23 flexures between the constraints, and the protection system 9 comprises a cantilever beam 40 extending from one of the end con straints 20, 21 coacting with a stop means 41 extending from the other of the end constraints 20, 21 to prevent the load cell 10 from exceeding its safe overload range.
