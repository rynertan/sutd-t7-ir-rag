## Description
APPARATUS AND METHODS FOR SUPPLYING GAS UNDER PRESSURE TO WELDABLE SHOCK ABSORBER CASINGS HAVING AN OPENING PIERCED THEREIN, AND LIKE PRODUCTS, AND WELD SEALING THE OPENING The automotive supply industry has long needed an economical, gas pressurized shock absorber for the after market, and the present invention is directed to apparatus and methods for supplying a low pressure gas, such as nitrogen, under pressure, to the shock absorber oil chamber through an opening pierced in the closed chamber. In the multiple stage process to be described, after the gas is supplied via the isolated opening, a metallic ball is fed individually to the opening by apparatus which reliably injects only one ball at a time, and then welds the ball in position to seal the opening. Shock absorbers of this type have a reduced ride control loss resulting from the aeration of shock absorber fluid because the nitrogen under pressure keeps air and other gases in solution within the shock absorber oil, rather than allowing foam to form and cause loss of control. The units, further, remain cooler which again means more control, and improved handling of the vehicle as a result. Still further, such shock absorbers better handle the road inputs being transmitted through them, and a less harsh ride with less noise can be obtained with such shock absorbers, without detracting from other important ride criteria. One of the problems which needed to be resolved in order to manufacture such shock absorbers on a high production, economical basis was to design efficient and reliable machinery which was not available, and had to be developed for the purpose of supplying the gas under pressure to the closed oil chamber and thereafter sealing the casing all without any material loss of pressure. In the past, apparatus has been developed for sealing such products as aerosol cans and light bulbs, for instance, but none of this apparatus which is exemplified in U. S. patents 284,674, 1,504,088, 1,708,868, 2,380,811 and 3,247,640 were deemed suited to the high production and reliability requirements of the manufacturer. As indicated, it is necessary that there be a positive gas seal during the manufacturing operation contemplated, and only one welding ball must be supplied at a time to a pierced opening which is particularly configured to receive it. When the ball is welded in position it collapses, and there must be provision for maintaining a welding pressure on the collapsing ball to achieve a proper weld.The device must, further, be so controlled that there is no weld expansion into the casing which can fragment off and contaminate the oil in the oil chamber of the shock absorber. With the foregoing in mind, it is a prime object of the present invention to provide a reliable, high production machine and method for performing the functions described in a manner which avoids complexity to the extent possible, and which is trouble free in nature in view of the high production rates which are necessary. It is a further object of the invention to provide for the piercing of an opening of predetermined configuration in the casing wall and to transfer only one ball to that opening from a supply thereof, in a position to be welded in place while the apparatus maintains a seal around the opening. An apparatus and method have been developed in which a sealing and electrically isolating housing reciprocably mounts a welding rod and a ball selecting mechanism operates sequentially with the rod to supply only a single ball to the opening punched in the casing in a positive manner from a side passage, there being a stripper feeder system for receiving a ball from a supply tube containing a plurality of such welding balls and feeding the ball to the passage in which the welding electrode operates. Other objects and advantages of the invention will be pointed out specifically, or will become apparent from the following description when it is considered in conjunction with the appended claims and the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 is an enlarged, sectional fragmentary view of one end of a typical two tube gas pressurized shock absorber of the type which has been described Figure 2 is an enlarged view, illustrating the configuration of the ope ning punched in the cylindrical outer casing of the oil chamber of the shock absorber, immediately prior to the time the apparatus to be described supplies the gas under pressure thereto and welds a ball in position Figure 3 is a similar view showing the ball which has been supplied to the opening, and the welding electrode which has been brought into contact with the ball Figure 4 is a partly sectional, elevational view of the apparatus for supplying the gas and the welding ball, and for welding the ball in position to afterward seal the opening through which the gas is supplied and Figure 5 is a schematic view of an electrical control circuit for the machinery to be more particularly described. In Figure 1, a shock absorber of the type indicated is shown, which embodies an outer casing 10, mounting rod 11. Surrounding rod 11 is the closed oil chamber 12 made up of cylindrical steel casings 13 and 14 and ends 15 only one of which is shown . End seals such as at 16 are provided for rod 11. In practice, in the construction of the shock absorber, a fluid under pressure, such as nitrogen gas, is to be supplied under pressure to the chamber 12 which contains a shock absorber fluid such as oil. In order to accomplish this, according to the invention described herein, a reciprocable piercing tool 17 Figure 2 is provided to punch a gas chargeinjecting opening 18 in outer chamber casing 14 before the unit is assembled within the shock absorber casing 10. The punching operation results in an inwardly turned, somewhat frustoconical seat 19, as indicated in Figure 2. As indicated in Figure 3, the configuration 19 and opening 18 are gauged such that a steel welding ball 20, typically 3 32 of an inch in diameter, can be received in the opening 18 in the manner disclosed in Figure 3.The tool 17 may be powered by a double acting, fluid pressure operated ram cylinder such as shown at 17a in Figure 5 , the machine being supported by framing F at a first station. The apparatus for supplying the nitrogen or other gas to chamber 12 is more particularly disclosed in Figure 4 and may be supported by the same framing F at a second adjacent, downstream operating station. As this figure indicates, a reciprocable semi cylindrical product holder 21 operated by a vertical air cylinder connected with the machine frame, or the like, may be provided for supporting the oil chamber device verti cally relative to a reciprocable welding head, generally designated H. The ram cylinder mounted head H includes an electrode housing, generally designated 22, comprising a vertical fitting 23 with a lower end projection 24 which has a lateral passage 25 communicating with a gas supplying hose 26, leading to a source of gas supply. Nitrogen gas has been used for various reasons, and one of these is that it is inert and not flammable, and will not be affected by, and will not affect, the welding operation which is to be described. The fitting 23 includes a central opening 27 within which an elongate gas sealing slide bushing 28 is received for reciprocably mounting a welding electrode rod 29, having a reduced diameter lower end 29a A reduced size orifice 30, constituting a ball and gas receiving chamber, is provided in continuation of opening 27 and opens through the bottom of fitting 23 to a seal mounting ring 31 to which a flexible resilient seal ring 32 may be adhesively, or otherwise suitably secured. The opening 31a in a ring 31 is adequate in diameter to freely pass the lower end 29a of welding rod 29, as is the opening 32a in the seal ring 32. The chamber 30 is axially disposed to pass electrode rod 29 and is closed at its upper end by bushing 28. At its upper end the housing 23 is provided with a seal ring 23a for bushing 28, and is closed by a ring cap 23b. Mounted on the frame F of the machine is a fluid pressure operated, double acting air cylinder 33, which supplies welding pressure to the welding electrode 29 and operates to retract it, cylinder 33 having a piston rod 34 connected by a member 35 to an adjustable spring housing coupling 36, comprised of an upper cap 37 threadably, and therefore adjustably, receiving a lower housing member 38. Slide bushing 39, carried by the member 38, receives a plunger member 40 having a spring supporting seat 41 with a spring retainer 41a, around which a coil spring 42, which bears against the face 37a of member 37, is disposed. Plunger 40 carries an insulating block member 43 to which a conductive welding current receiving terminal strap 44 is secured, and it is strap 44 which engages the upper end of welding electrode 29. For a purpose to be later described, an angle shaped, electrically non conductive strap 45 is secured as at 46 to block 43, to depend therefrom, and bar 45 has a lower leg 47 which cooperates with a ring 48 provided on the upper end of welding rod 29 to act as a lift bar when the welding electrode 29 is to be returned to an inoperative position. The welding balls 20 are supplied from a hopper not shown via a flexible tube 49, mounted on a ball stripping and transfer mechanism 50 secured to housing 22 at one side which includes a passage 51 extending vertically from tube 49 to an upper lateral passage 52. Passage 52 leads to a vertical passage 53, which, in turn, leads to a lower lateral passage 54 extending completely through the lower end of the block member which comprises the mechanism 50. The passages 52, 53 and 54 are all of such diameter as to permit the passage of only a single welding ball 20. Mounted on the upper end of block 50 is a support bracket 55 with a slide saddle 55a for slidably supporting a cylindrical ball stripper head section 56 having a forwardly extending, reduced size stripper plunger 57 thereon, and also mounting a stop 56a which engages saddle 55a to locate the retracted position of plunger 57. A spring 58 normally biases the ball feeding rod 57 outwardly to the position shown in Figure 4. It is to be noted that rod 57 has a through opening or port 59 which will pass one of the welding balls 20 to passage 53, when the plunger 57 is moved forwardly to vertically align port 59 with passage 53. At the lower end of block 50, a bracket 60 has a saddle 60a which similarly reciprocably mounts a similar plunger head section 61, having a similar forwardly extending, reduced diameter stripper or transfer plunger 62 thereon. Stop 61a on plunger 62 engages saddle 60a to locate the retracted position of plunger 62. A spring 63 surrounding pusher rod 62 normally urges plunger 62 outwardly. The rod 62 similarly has a through opening or port 64 and it will be obserbed that the rod 62 is of such length as to extend into a lateral opening 65 in block 23, which communicates with the chamber 30. A suitable slide bushing 66, with sealingO rings 67, is provided in housing 23 to slidably accommodate the front end of rod 62. To actuate plungers 57 and 62, an air cylinder 68, fixed to block 50, has its piston rod 68a connected with a striker frame, generally designated 69, and comprising plates 70 and 71 which support an upper striker rod 72 and a lower striker rod 73, each of which is in axial alignment with one of the sections 56 and 61. Plainly, when piston rod 68a is retracted, rod 73 is brought into abutting engagement with the plunger head section 61 to cause it to move forwardly into passage 25 to a position in which port 64 aligns with chamber 30 and a ball 20 is dropped into the chamber 30, spring 63 being compriessed at this time by plate 61a.A short time thereafter, striker rod i2 contacts plunger head member 56 to move rod 57 from the position shown over to dispose the port 59 in axial alignment with the passage 53. It is to be noted that block 23 is recessed as at 23a to receive the front end of plunger 57. Finally, it is to be noted that the secondary of a welding transformer T is connected in a series circuit x with power supply bar 44 and the tube holder 21.In Figure 5, the extend and retract solenoids of cylinder 33 are operated by switches 76 and 77 respectively.The extend and retract solenoids of cylinder 68 are operated by switches 78 and 79 respectively. The extend and retract solenoids of cylinder 17a are operated by switches 80 and 81 respectively, and the extend and retract solenoids of cylinder 82 for raising and lowering holder 21 are operated by switches 83 and 84. The extend and retract solenoids of the cylinder 85 are operated by switches 86 and 87 and all of the switches in Figure 5 may be cam or otherwise controlled. In operation, and with the head H and welding electrode 29 in retracted position, the shock absorber casing holder 21 may be first moved upwardly by way of double acting air cylinder 82 Figure 5 to hold the shock absorber casing. Then head H is lowered via cylinder 85 to dispose the pre punched opening 18 in axial alignment with the opening 32a in seal 32. At this point, a suitable gas valve V such as a solenoid operated valve in line 26 is opened to admit nitrogen, or another suitable, gas under pressure to the port 25 to proceed on into the interior of chamber 12, until the desired volume of gas is added. After a short time delay to accomplish filling afte r which valve V closes , cylinder 68 is energized to retract piston rod 68a and this causes striker 73 to move the feeder rod 62 forwardly from the position shown in Figure 4 to deliver a ball 20 previously deposited in port 64, via the chamber 30 and opening 32a, to a seated position in seat 19. Shortly thereafter, striker 72 engages the head 56 of rod 57 to move it forwardly to deliver a ball 20 from passage 59 to the passage 53 from which it drops until it comes into contact with the upper surface of rod 62. Since only one ball 20 can drop into passage 59 at any time, and the chute 51 is displaced from passage 53 and sealed from it, there is no possibility of more than one ball 20 at a time ever being delivered.Once delivery is accomplished, cylinder 68 can be operated to extend rod 68a and striker frame 69, and spring 58 and 63 will be freed to restore plungers 57 and 62 to the Figure 4 position. When the rod 62 reaches original position, the ball which has been awaiting it in vertical passage 53 drops into the port 64 ready for initiation of the next cycle of the machine. cylinder 33 is then operated to extend piston rod 34 and force electrode 29 from a position in which its lower end is above the level of passage 51, down to a position in engagement with the ball 20 to be welded. At the time electrode 29 has descended, welding current is supplied through terminal strap 44. As the cylinder 33 continues to exert force against the piston rod 34, spring 42 acts to continue to urge rod 29 downwardly and, as the ball 20 being welded collapses, rod 29 follows it to maintain the welding contact until the opening sealing weld is completed. Then head H is raised by cylinder 85 and piston rod 34 is retracted by cylinder 33 via lifting bar 47 to original position, and the cylinder 82 can be activated to lower holder 21. Because of the lifter bar 47 construction, it is possible to readily remove and replace the electrode, as necessary. The weld effected is a direct current weld, with the spring 42 retaining pressure on the electrode 29a to instantaneously follow the collapsing ball, and does not depend on activation of an air cylinder. The latter would introduce a time lag which would cause arcing, and interfere with satisfactory welding. With the device indicated, a troublefree operation is provided which assures that only one ball at a time can be supplied to this thin wall tubing. It is to be understood that the drawings and descriptive matter are in all cases to be interpreted as merely illustrative of the principles of the invention, rather than as limiting the same in any way, since it is contemplated that various changes may be made in various elements. to achieve like results without departing from the spirit of the invention or the scope of the appended claims.
