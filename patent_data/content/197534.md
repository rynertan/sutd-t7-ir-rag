# Radio pager having local and wide area reception modes.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a radio pager wherein a manually controlled channel selector 12 selects a first channel to operate the pager in a local area reception mode and selects a second channel to operate it in a wide area reception mode. A receiving circuit is responsive to the selector for receiving a first paging signal transmitted on the first channel and receiving a second paging signal transmitted on the second channel, the first and second paging signals containing address signals in first and second code formats, respective ly. A decoder 8 is responsive to the manual selector 13 for comparing the address signal of the first paging signal with a first identification signal representing a user s identification number in the first code format and comparing the address a signal of the second paging signal with a second identifica tion signal representing the same user s identification num ber in the second code format. The decoder produces a coincidence signal when the address signal of each paging signal coincides with the identification signal of the corres ponding code format to generate an audible tone.
