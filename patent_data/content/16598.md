# Oil burner diffuser and method of increasing the fuel air mixing efficiency in a gun type oil burner.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to oil burner combustion efficiency improving devices, known as diffusers, and particu larly to such devices used in conjunction with gun type pres surized oil burners. The present invention comprises a for wardly positioned cone 12 having a central opening 34 and a series of holes peripherally spaced around the central open ing, a cylindrical member 14 extending rearwardly from the periphery of the cone, and a back ring 16 having a large central opening radially extending inwardly toward the cen tral opening of the cone. The diffuser achieves nearly com plete combustion of the emanating fuel oil from the spray nozzle with a minimum of excess air and with virtually no carbon deposit buildup on it or the oil burner components.
