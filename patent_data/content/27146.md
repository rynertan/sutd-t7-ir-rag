# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING HYDROGEN.

## Abstract
A process for producing hydrogen by electrolysis of an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution using an electrolytic cell wherein a gas and liquid permeable anode and a gas and liquid permeable cathode are connected to respective sides of a fluorine containing cation exchange membrane. This process enables the use of an inexpensive metal as a material for the electrolytic cell, and the production of hydrogen stably for a long period of time at a low voltage.
