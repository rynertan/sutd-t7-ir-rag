The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof which process comprises the reaction of a compound of formula XVI EMI16.1 or a salt thereof, wherein i when Rg and R10 in the desired compound of formula I are hydrogen and R101 as hereinbefore defined respectively, X is halo Y is COR10Ú as hereinbefore defined or nitrile and the remaining variables are as hereinbefore defined with a compound of formula R2HN NH Rl where R1 and R2 are as hereinbefore defined and thereafter, in the resultant compound, when Y is nitrile, converting Y to COR101 as hereinbefore defined optionally converting R101 to other R101 ii when Rg and R10 in the desired compound of formula I together represent a bond a X is NR2 NH Rl where R1 and R2 are as hereinbefore defined and Y is COR11 where Rii is halo or Y is COR10ê where R102 is as hereinbefore defined and the compound of formula XVI or the salt thereof optionally prepared by process variant i hereinbefore optionally followed by salification b X is halo, and Y is CON NR2Rl Rl where R1 and R2 are as hereinbefore defined and R15 is hydrogen or a labile deactivating N protecting group c X is C1 6 alkoxyamino or azido and Y is CONHR1 where R1 is as hereinbefore defined to cyclise and thereafter, in the resultant compound of formula I wherein Rg and R10 together represent a bond optionally converting R2 or R7 hydrogen to other R2 or R7 and, in the resultant compound of formula I , optionally converting R8 to other Rg and optionally formipg a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Suitable salts of those compounds of formula XVI which can form salts include the salts listed hqreinbefore as examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts for compounds of formula I . Suitable values for X in process variant i when it is halo include chloro and bromo, preferably chloro. The reaction of process variant i of a compound of formula XVI or a salt thereof with R2HN NH Ri where Rl and R2 are as hereinbefore defined is generally carried out with the compound itself rather than with any salt it may form. In this case the reaction may be carried out in an inert solvent, such as a lower alkanol for example ethanol, or in a mixture of such solvents. The reaction may conveniently be effected at a slightly elevated temperature, for example in the range 600 to 100oC, such as between 700 and 900C, and most conveniently at the boiling point of the reaction mixture.However, it will be appreciated that when Y in the compound of formula XVI or the salt thereof is COR102 as hereinbefore defined, that is, carboxyl or C16 alkoxycarbonyl, the resultant compound of formula I or the salt thereof may serve as a starting material for process variant ii a . In general the temperature for the cyclisation of the resultant compound from process variant i will be higher than a convenient reaction temperature for its formation in process variant i and the isolation of the desired product of process variant i presents no problems.However, in order to isolate some resultant compounds of formula I wherein Rg is hydrogen and RIO is hydroxy or Cl 6 alkoxy before they cyclise to corresponding compounds of formula I wherein Rg and RlO together are a bond, the skilled man will appreciate that it may be necessary to effect reaction at a substantially lower temperature. When Y is nitrile in the compound of formula XVI or its salts, the corresponding group in the compound resulting from the foregoing reaction must be subsequently converted to COR10Ú as hereinbefore defined. When Rlol is amino or hydroxyl, conversion may be achieved by conventional hydrolysis of the nitrile group, adjusting the reaction conditions conventionally to obtain the desired product. An R101 hydroxyl group may be subsequently converted to an R10Ú Cl 6 alkoxy group by conventional esteri fication. As regards the optional subsequent interconversion of R101 substituents in the compound of formula I resulting from process variant i , some of these are discussed immediately hereinbefore. Other such interconversions include the conversion of R101 C16 alkoxy or amino to hydroxyl by conventional deesterification and amide hydrolysis respectively. All such interconversions may of course also be effected for corresponding groups in all intermediates in the synthetic route to the compounds of formula I and their salts, in particular in intermediates of formulae XVI to XVIII . In process variant ii a , as mentioned hereinbefore, when X is R2N NH Rl where Rl and R2 are as hereinbefore defined and Y is COR10ê where R102 is as hereinbefore defined, the compounds of formula XVI is also of formula I . The cyclisation of the compound or a salt thereof to a compound of formula I wherein Rg and R10 together are a bond, or a salt thereof, may be effected by heating the compound or its salt to a temperature in the range of 700 to 1800C, advantageously in an inert liquid such as a lower alkanol for example ethanol or sec butanol, or an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon or aromatic ether, such as toluene, xylene, biphenyl or diphenyl ether, or a mixture of such liquids.The liquid or liquid mixture is preferably a solvent for the compound of formula XVI or the salt thereof, where a liquid or liquid mixture is used. The reaction may most conveniently be effected at the boiling point of the reaction mixture. It is advantageous to use an inert solvent with a boiling point above that of the water or alkanol generated in the cyclisation reaction and to distil off that water or alkanol during the reaction. It is possible to generate the intermediate compound of formula XVI wherein X is R2N NH R1 whereR1 and R2 are as hereinbefore defined and R10 is hydroxy or C16 alkoxy or the salt thereof and to cyclise it in situ without isolation in a one pot process. In this case it is often convenient to effect the first step in a relatively low boiling inert solvent, such as a lower alkanol, for example ethanol, at the boiling point of the reaction mixture, and then to add a higher boiling inert solvent such as an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon or an aromatic ether and to effect the second step at the boiling point of that reaction mixture. Where the water or lower alkanol generated in the second step is distilled off,any solvent lower alkanol will of course also distil off. Alternatively it is convenient to produce the compound of formula XVI or in particular the salt therof by process variant i to isolate the compound or its salt for use in process variant ii a . In this case it is convenient to effect the cyclisation in a relatively low boiling inert solevent, such as a lower alkanol for example ethanol or sec butanol, at the boiling point of the reaction mixture under reflux. The reaction may advantageously be effected in the presence of a base, such as a mild inorganic base, for example potassium carbonate. When an acid addition salt of a compound of formula XVI is used, it is advantageous to use more than one equivalent of base. As an alternative to the direct cyclisation of a compound of formula XVI or a salt thereof wherein X is R2N NH Rl and Y is COR102 where Rl and R102 are as hereinbefore defined, such a compound wherein Y is carboxy or a salt of the compound may be halogenated conventionally to form the corresponding acid halide, and this acid halide cyclised under conditions similar to those described hereinbefore for process variant i . The acid halide or its salt may cyclise in situ on formation in the halogenation process. In process variant ii b , examples of R15 when a labile deactivating N protecting group include trifluoroacetyl. In process variant ii b , the acid hydrazides of formula XVI or their salts may be cyclised in solvents and at temperatures similar to those for process variant ii a . Advantageously the reaction is effected under basic conditions, in order to neutralize the generated hydrohalic acids, for example in the presence of an alkali metal hydroxide and water. In process variant ii c the ring closure of the amides of formula XVI or their salts occurs by heating them to a temperature between 1200 and 3000, preferably between 2000 and 2500, advantageously in one or more inert solvents. The optional subsequent conversion of R2 or R7 when hydrogen in the resultant cyclised compound of formula I wherein Rg and R10 together are a bond to other R2 or R7 may be effected conventionally using respectively a compound of formula R21 2Q1or R71Q2 wherein R21 and R7l are each Cl 6 alkyl optionally substituted by hydroxy or amino disubstituted by C 6 alkyl, or by phenyl optionally substituted as defined hereinbefore for Rl, and Ol is a reactive divalent ester group, and Q2 is halo or a reactive monovalent ester group. Examples of Ol include sulphate.Examples of Q2 include mesyloxy and tosyloxy, and in particular halo such as iodo.Groups R8 may be interconverted in all the resultant compounds of formula I by methods generally known in the art of aromatic chemistry, although such interconversion is desirably avoided. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the resultant compound of formula I may be formed conventionally, for example by treatment of the compound with the corresponding acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts at the COR10 carboxyl group of some compounds of formula I may also be found conventionally, for example by treatment of the compound with a corresponding base. An intermediate of the formula XVI in process variant i that is wherein X is halo and Y is CO R101 as hereinbefore defined or nitrile may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula XVII EMI23.1 wherein yl is COR101 as hereinbefore defined or nitrile, and the variables are as hereinbefore defined, with a halogenating agent. Suitable halogenating agents include phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorus oxybromide, thionyl chloride and phosphorus pentachloride. Phosphorus oxychloride is a preferred halogenating agent. It will be appreciated that, if a compound of formula XVI wherein yl is carboxy or amino optionally substituted as herein before defined is desired, then yl is preferably not corresponding carboxy or amino optionally substituted as hereinbefore defined in the compound of formula XVII because of possible halogenation of yl. Thus, where the desired compound of formula XVI contains a yl carboxy group, yl in the compound of formula XVII is preferably C1 6 alkoxycarbonyl or nitrile, which may be hydrolysed to carboxyl in the resultant compound of formula XVI as described hereinbefore. However when yl in the desired compound of formula XVI is amino optionally substituted as hereinbefore defined, use may be made of the halogenation of yl when carboxy in the compound of formula XVII , to give a compound of formula XXV see hereinafter . The compound of formula XXV then may be reacted conventionally with ammonia optionaly substituted as hereinbefore defined for yl when amino to give the desired compound of formula XVII . Compounds of the formula XVII where G isL.C.Z.as in formula II where L and Z are as hereinbefore defined may be prepared in accordance with known procedures, for example by the cyclisation of a compound of formula XVIII EMI24.1 wherein G1 is L.C.Z as in formula II where L and Z are as hereinbefore defined, R12 is hydrogen or C16 alkyl, and the remaining variables are as hereinbefore defined. Cyclisation may be effected by heating to a moderately elevated temperature in the presence of a halogenating agent and optionally in an inert solvent.A preferred halogenating agent is phosphorus oxychloride when cyclisation may be effected without solvent at the boiling point of the reaction mixture. Alternatively the reaction may be effected by heating to a more elevated temperature optionally in an inert liquid medium such as Dowtherm or ethyl polyphosphate. In this reaction the compound of formula XVII is also halogenated in situ to give a compound of formula XVI , thus offering a convenient one pot preparative process. The compound of formula XVIII may be prepared by the conventional condensation of a compound of formula XIX or an alkali metal salt thereof EMI25.1 wherein the variables are as hereinbefore defined, with a compound of formula XX EMI26.1 wherein Q3 is a leaving group, for example Cl 6 alkoxy, and the remaining variables are as hereinbefore defined, with simultaneous decarboxylation. Alternatively, compounds of the formula XVII may be prepared by the cyclisation in accordance with known procedures of a compound of formula XXI EMI26.2 wherein R13 is hydrogen or C16 alkyl and the remaining variables are as hereinbefore defined. Cyclisation may be effected by heating in an inert solvent, such as ethanol to a slightly elevated temperature, conveniently the boiling point of the reaction mixture, in the presence of a base, such as sodium ethoxide. The compound of formula XXI may be prepared by the conventional condensation of a compound of formula XXII EMI26.3 wherein the variables are as hereinbefore defined with a compound of formula XXIII EMI27.1 wherein Q4 is a leaving group, for example Cl 6 alkoxy, and the remaining variables are as hereinbefore defined. Compounds of formula XVII wherein R6.is hydrogen may be prepared by base catalysed hydrolysis followed by decarboxylation, of a compound of formula XXIV EMI27.2 The decarboxylation may occur at elevated temperatures by heating in an inert solvent such as 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene.

Shock Induced Suppression of Drinking in the RatThe shock induced suppression of drinking SSD test adapted from Vogel et al., 1971 is considered a reliable and specific method for showing up potential anxiolytics.20h water deprived rats c Hacking and Churchill, CFHB , familiarised to the test apparatus the day before test, are allowed to drink for 30 sec and then receive O.5m sec. footshock, maximum 0.5mA, for every 5 sec of drinking time accumulated in a 3 min session. Drugs were administered, intraperitoneally, 30 min before test.The number of shocks taken during a given test period are recorded and results expressed as percentage change from control. Anxiolytic drugs such as benzodiazepines release the behaviour of rats suppressed in this way, such that the number of shocks taken increases in a dose dependent manner.J.R. Vogel et al., 1971 Psychopharmacologia Berl. 21, 1 7.The results are shown in Table 2.ToxicityNo toxic effects were observed in these tests.

Radioligand Binding Studies, in vitro An interaction with benzodiazepine receptors in the central nervous system may be indicative of anxiolytic activity since inhibition of benzodiazepine binding correlates with the clinical efficacy of benzodiazepines. 3H Flunitrazepam and 3H ssCCe selectively label benzo diazepine receptors and displacement of this specific binding in vitro by novel compounds in well washed, frozen rat whole brain membranes is measured essentially as described by Martin and Candy 1978 . At the fixed concentration of 0.5nM used, specific binding of both 3H ligands represents 80 90 of the total radioactivity bound. Non specific binding is defined by lOuM clonazepam for each ligand. IC50 values are calculated from log dose against inhibition curves Ki values are deter mined using the Cheng Prusoff equation. Martin, I.L. Candy, J.M. 1978 Neuropharm., 17, 993 998.
