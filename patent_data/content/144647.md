# Differential amplifier.

## Abstract
A differential amplifier has first and second transistors Q10, Q12 whose bases respectively receive first and second voltage signals. The collectors of the first and second npn transistors Q10, Q12 are commonly connected to a power source terminal 34 respectively through resistors R14, R16 . The emitters of the first and second npn transistors Q10, Q12 are grounded through a constant current source CS . The differential amplifier further has first and second pnp transistors Q14, Q16 in a common base configuration. The collectors of the first and second npn transistors Q10, Q12 are connected to the emitters of the first and second pnp transistors Q14, Q16 .
