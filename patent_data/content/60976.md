# Method and apparatus for starting an alcohol engine.

## Abstract
In a method and apparatus for starting an alcohol engine equipped with a starting motor, alcohol is converted into a high temperature gaseous mixture containing a relatively highly volatile substance. The gas is cooled to provide a liquid condensate containing the relatively highly volatile substance. The liquid condensate is supplied to the engine as fuel when the starting motor is in operation.
