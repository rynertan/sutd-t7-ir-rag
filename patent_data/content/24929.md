# Production of polyurethane foams, and foams made thereby.

## Abstract
Polyurethane froth foams are produced by applying a layer of uncured froth to a support 1 , bringing a layer 9 of material into contact with the froth layer e.g. from a kiss roll 10 , followed by heating to cure the foam. The process gives a bigger reduction in density on curing than when no backing layer 9 is used.

## Description
PRODUCTION OF POLYURETHANE FOAMS, AND FOAMS MADE THEREBY The present invention relates to a process for the production of polyurethane froth foams. Polyurethane foams are conventionally made by the action of a blowing agent water on free isocyanate groups present in the polyurethane resin mixture which is to be foamed. Foaming and curing take place at the same time in the conventional system. GB 1 306 372 discloses a process for making a polyurethane foam which does not make use of chemical blowing agents to make a foam but which instead produces a foam by beating air or other inert gas i.e.gas which is inert under the reaction conditions into the liquid mixture of polyurethane resin components. These foams made by beating in air or other inert gas are known as froth foams and are referred to as such throughout this specification The froth foam is cured in a separate step by application of heat. Froth foams are particularly useful in the floor covering industry to provide a foamed underlayer for carpets and other types of floor covering, for example, the so called vinyl floor coverings based on flexible polyvinyl chloride sheet. Froth foams are generally used by applying the foam to a continuous moving band of material. The surface may be the material to which the foam has to be applied. It may also be a release paper from which the cured foam is subsequently removed for bonding to the material, for example, floor covering, to which it has finally to be applied. The thickness of the foam layer may be controlled, for example, by passing the uncured foam layer beneath a knife or doctor blade. The moving band carrying the froth foam is then usually passed to an oven in which the foam cures. At the same time the density of the foam decreases because of thermal expansion of the air bubbles in the foam. The cured foam is thus less dense than the uncured foam fed to the process and the thickness of the cured foam layer is greater than the thickness of the uncured foam layer sent to the curing stage. The user of the froth foam generally specifies that the cured foam layer must have a certain minimum thickness. If the density of the cured foam can be decreased, the total quantity of polyurethane resin ingredients required for a given thickness of foam can be reduced. However, there is a practical limit on the amount of inert gas e.g. air which can be incorporated into a froth foam by beating. The decrease in density on curing generally has a relationship to the density of the uncured foam and the density of a cured foam is typically about. 70X of the density of the uncured foam for foams described in the above mentioned Btitish patent. We have now found a method of obtaining a greater reduction in foam density of froth foams on curing than could normally be obtained by the prior art method. According to the present invention the process of producing a cured polyurethane froth foam comprises feeding a layer of uncured polyurethane froth foam of pre determined thickness onto a support, followed by heating to cure the foam characterised in that curing of the foam takes place with a layer of material in kissing contact with the foam. By kissing contact is meant throughout this specification that the layer of material has been brought into contact with the uncured froth foam on its support without any substantial crushing or depression of the foam and that the layer of material is free to move outwardly from the support in response to any expansion of the foam. Polyurethane resin ingredients suitable for use in making froth foams are known to those skilled in the art. Thus suitable isocyanate and polyols are disclosed in British Patent Specification 1,306,372. It is particularly preferred to use organic polysiloxane surfactants which are high molecular weight linear siloxanepolyoxyalkylene block copolymers of the AB type where n is an integer, each A is a siloxane block and each B is a polyoxyalkylene block, the blocks being linked by a divalent atom or a divalent group. Said high molecular weight siloxane polyoxyalkylene block copolymers may be divided into two classes.1. hydrolyzable block copolymers, i.e. those wherein the siloxane blocks and the polyoxyalkylene blocks are linked by silicon to oxygen to carbon linkages, and 2. non hydrolyzable hydrolytically stable block copolymers, i.e.those wherein the siloxane blocks and polyoxyalkylene blocks are linked by silicon to carbon linkages. The preferred copolymer surfactants are those of the hydrolyzable type. The siloxane block in the above mentioned linear copolymers is a linear siloxane polymer or chain of recurring siloxane units, R2SiO , and is illustrated by the average formula R2SiO x, for the hydrolyzable block copolymers and by the average formula R2SiO ,R2Si for the non hydrolyzable block copolymers, whereinR is a monovalent hydrocarbon group, x is an integer of at least 7 and a is an integer of at least 6. The average molecular weight of each siloxane block of said siloxanepolyoxyalkylene coploymers ranges from about 500 to about 10,000. Moreover, the monovalent hydrocarbon radicals need not be identical throughout the siloxane block, but can differ from siloxane unit to siloxane unit and can even be different within a single siloxane unit. Such high molecular weight linear block copolymers are described in more detail in US Patent Specification 4,022,941. The liquid mixture of polyurethane components subjected to frothing may contain various conventional additives, e.g catalysts, cross linking agents. Examples of such additives are disclosed inBritish Patent 1,306,372. Details of how froths can be prepared are given in the aboveBritish Patent Specification. It is cheapest and most convenient to prepare froth foams using air but any other inert gas, i.e. gas which does not react with any component of the liquid phase may be used, e.g. nitrogen, carbon dioxide. If x is the density of the froth foam and y is the density of the unfrothed liquid at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure then the known foams are made by beating in sufficient air such that x is less than 0.45 y. Because the process of the present invention gives a bigger reduction in density on curing, it may be preferred only to introduce sufficient inert gas at the frothing stage such that x is not less than 0.45 y, more preferably not less than 0.5 y, more preferably not less than 0.6 y. For any desired foam density it is preferred to incorporate sufficient inert gas to give a density of uncured foam. not less than 150Z of the density of the cured foam, more preferably not less than 200 of the density of the cured foam. It is thus a feature of the present invention that it enables a cured froth foam of density d to be obtained from a froth having a density of not less than 1.5 d. There is a practical limitation on the maximum amount of air or other inert gas which can be incorporated into a froth. The present invention enables a cured froth foam layer to be obtained which has an average density which is a lower percentage of the uncured froth foam density than when the process of the invention is not used. The process of the present invention therefore enablesscured froth foam layers to be obtained which have densities below those which can normally be obtained. Thus the process of the present invention can be used to produce cured froth foam layers with an average density below 450 g litre, more particularly below 400 g litre. The support layer to which the froth foam is applied may be a release paper or may be a layer of material to which it is desirable to bond the foam providing that the material is one which can withstand the temperature used for curing and forms a good bond with foam. The layer in issing contact with the froth foam may be a material which it is desired to bond to the foam, for example, a fibrous reinforcing layer. Alternatively it may be a release paper.Where the support and the layer in kissing contact are both release papers they may be stripped off after curing to give a layer consisting of foam only. It is to be understood that the term release paper embraces not only sheets made from cellulose fibres but any material which does not bond to the foam and can be stripped off after curing. Where the layer in kissing contact is a fibrous reinforcing material it is preferable for it to be one which is wetted by the foam to give good bonding to the cured foam. Examples of suitable fibrous sheet reinforcing materials are glass fibre mats and veils. The weight per unit area of any material, e.g. a fibrous reinforcing mat or veil which is to be in kissing contact with froth foam should be such that the foam is not crushed or depressed. The optimum weight per unit area may be determined by a simple test. The process of the present invention may be used to apply a polyurethane foam backing layer to a floor covering having an upper layer of vinyl chloride polymer. It may also be used in the manufacture of carpets. Carpets are often provided with a backing of fibrous material e.g. jute or polypropylene. This backing is at present usually fixed to the carpet by a latex adhesive. The process of the present invention may be used to apply a polyurethane froth foam to the back of a carpet to bring the backing layer into kissing contact with the foam, and then to cure the froth foam. The polyurethane foam can then serve as an adhesive to bond the backing to the carpet. At the same time it provides a resilient interlayer of reduced density so increasing comfort. A convenient method of carrying out the invention is to apply uncured froth foam continuously to a moving band of support material e.g. a release paper. The thickness of the foam is controlled by a knife or doctor blade under which the moving band passes. A layer of material is applied to the upper surface of the froth foam by being fed into contact with the foam by a so called kiss roll . This kiss roll is so operated that the layer of material applied by it is brought into contact without pressing or depressing the foam signific antly. The moving band is then passed through an oven in which the foam cures. Examples of suitable curing conditions are temperatures of 1200C to 2000C and residence times from 1 to 10 minutes. Apparatus suitable for carrying out the process of the present application is shown diagrammatically in Figure 1. Release paper 1 is unwound continuously from a reel of release paper 2 and after passing over roll 3 moves in a horizontal path through a tunnel oven 4 and is then after passing round roll 5 taken up on take up reel 6. Polyurethane froth is fed on to the release paper through nozzle 7. A knife blade 8 extending across the width of the strip of release paper regulates the thickness of the layer of froth which is carried on the release paper to the oven. The distance between the lower edge of the knife and the release paper strip can be adjusted to control the thickness of the froth layer. A fabric layer 9 is unwound from a kiss roll 10 on to the froth layer without any substantial crushing of the froth. The froth passes into the oven where it is heated and cured. During the heating step the cured foam bonds to the fabric layer and the combined layers are wound up on to roll 11. Examples 1 3 A froth foam was prepared from a mixture of polyols, isocyanate, catalyst and surfactant in a conventional way in an Oakes mixture. The froth foam formulation used consisted of parts by weight A mixture of polyether polyols 95 Monoethylene glycol 5 A silicone surfactant a high molecular weight linear block copolymer of formula AB n where n is an integer and each A is a polyoxyalkylene block, the blocks being linked through a divalent atom or group. 1 Catalyst dehydrated nickel acetyl acetonate, 10t solution in xylene . 2 Calcium carbonate filler 140 Polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate Crude MD1 35.6 The quantity of air incorporated into the mixture was sufficient to give a density at ambient temperature of 720 g litre. This density was determined by filling a cup of known volume with the froth until the froth was level with the top and then weighing the cup.The density of the froth measured in this way is sometimes known as cup density. The froth was fed on to a release paper which was unwound from a reel at a constant rate. The release paper passed under a knife which regulated the depth of froth on the paper. A light non woven fibrous fabric veil made from a mixture of polyester fibres and glass fibre was fed from a kiss roll on to the foam so as to be in kissing contact with the froth. The release paper, froth and veil then passed through a tunnel oven in which the froth was cured. After leaving the oven the cured foam and the veil adhering to it were wound up on to a roll and the release paper was wound up on to a separate roll. The conditions used and results obtained are set out in Table 1.Test A This is a comparativ e test not according to the invention. This was carried out exactly as in Example 1 but without the veil being applied. The results are given in Table 1.
