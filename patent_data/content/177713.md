## Description
The present invention relates to a polycarbonate resin as defined in claim 1. Particularly, it relates to a material useful for the production of a molded product having excellent heat resistance and optical characteristics, and in particular, to a material useful for the production of an optical disc substrate having excellent transparency and a minimum optical distortion. Heretofore, polycarbonate resins containing carbonate bond constituting units having at least one pendant aromatic group, have been disclosed in literatures EP A 89801 . However, their physical properties are described usually in terms of Tg or Tm, and it is not known whether they have practically suitable physical properties as molded products, or whether they can practically be processed. A molded product to be used for optical purposes, such as a molded product in the form of a plate or sheet, is required to be transparent and to have a minimum optical distortion. Particularly when used as an optical information material i.e. an optical disc with use of digital signals, such as a digital audio disc, a digital video disc or a disc for information readout or writing in, the requirement for the transparency is extremely strict, and with respect to the optical distortion, the double refraction of the molded product is required to be not higher than 5 x 10 ⁵. It is common to employ injection molding as a simple method for molding a product of this type. However, as a method for minimizing the optical distortion, it is common to raise the molten resin temperature or reduce the molecular weight of the resin to improve the melt flow characteristics. Furthermore, in the case of a disc intended for continuous use over a long period of time, the requirement for heat resistance is also strict with a view to providing adequate durability for use under severe environmental conditions. If the molten resin temperature is raised to minimize the optical distortion, various troubles are likely to be led resulting from the thermal deterioration of the resin. On the other hand, if the molecular weight of the resin is reduced, the strength of the disc will be inadequate, and it becomes difficult to obtain a satisfactory molded product. With respect to the glass transition temperature representing the heat resistance, each resin has its own value, and there is no room for improvement. Thus, the conventional technology does not provide a satisfactory solution. The present inventors have conducted extensive researches on polycarbonate resins which may be molded by melt molding and which have superior optical characteristics and heat resistance to poly carbonates prepared from 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, and have found that such an object of the present invention can be accomplished by a polycarbonate resin containing carbonate bond constituting units each having at least one pendant aromatic group and which has a certain specific molecular weight, whereby the problems of the conventional technique can be solved. Namely, the present invention provides a polycarbonate for optical disc having an average molecular weight M wherein each of X and Y is a hydrogen atom, an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or an aryl or aralkyl group having from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, provided that at least one of X and Y is an aryl or aralkyl group having from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, and each of Z and W is a hydrogen atom or an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The polycarbonate resin of the present invention contains from 60 to 100 by weight, based on the total carbonate bond constituting units, of carbonate bond constituting units of formula I hereinafter referred to simply as carbonate bond units A , and has an average molecular weight M For the purpose of the present invention, the carbonate bond is meant for a bond obtained by the reaction of an alcoholic hydroxyl group or a phenolic hydroxyl group with e.g. phosgene. The carbonate bond constituting unit is meant for a structural unit between such carbonate bonds. Further, the structural unit between the carbonate bonds may contain other types of bonds such as ester bonds, amide bonds, carbamate bonds or ether bonds. Further, as a structural unit which may be contained together with the above structural unit, there may be mentioned one having the formula wherein X is a bivalent group of wherein each of R¹ and R² is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and R³ is an alkylene group having from 4 to 5 carbon atoms , and the aromatic rings may be substituted by an alkyl group or a halogen atom. For the production of such a polycarbonate, there may be employed a conventional method for inter facial or solution polymerization, wherein phosgene is blown into at least one of diol compounds, particularly aromatic diol compounds, capable of presenting the structural unit of the formula I. As the diol capable of presenting the structural unit of the formula I, there may be mentioned, for instance, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl phenylmethane, 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1 phenylethane, 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1 phenylpropane, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl diphenylmethane, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl dibenzylmethane, o cumyl resorcinol, or phenolphthalein. In the present invention, carbonate bond constituting units containing no pendant aromatic group may also be introduced. Such introduction improves the melt flow characteristics of the resulting polycarbonate and thus is preferred for the improvement of moldability. As the comonomer to be used in such a case, there may be mentioned as the one capable of presenting the structural unit of the formula II, 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane, 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane, 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane i.e. bisphenol A , 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl butane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 3 methylbutane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl hexane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 4 methylpentane, 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclohexane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxy 3 chlorophenyl propane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxy 3 methyl phenyl propane, 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl ether, 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfide or a bivalent phenol compound such as resorcinol or o methyl resorcinol. Further, in some cases, a small amount of un acid chloride such as isophthalic acid chloride, adipic acid chloride or sebacic acid chloride, or a diamine such as piperazine, may be present for the copolymerization to introduce a bond other than the carbonate bond into the carbonate bond constituting unit. For the introduction of carbonate bond constituting units other than the carbonate bond units A, copolymerization may be conducted within a range which satisfies the requirements of the present invention, or polymers separately produced may be mixed to satisfy the requirements of the present invention. The method for the production of a polycarbonate resin from a diol containing at least one pendant aromatic group and phosgene, may be carried out by introducing into the diol an aqueous alkaline solution or pyridine as an acid acceptor in the presence of an inert solvent such as methylene chloride or 1,2 dichloromethane and introducing and reacting phosgene therewith. When an aqueous alkaline solution is used as the acid acceptor, the reaction rate can be increased by using as the catalyst a tertiary amine such as trimethylamine or triethylamine or a quaternary ammonium compound such as tetrabutyl ammonium chloride or benzyltributyl ammonium bromide. If necessary, a monovalent phenol such as phenol or p tert butylphenol may be used as a molecular weight modifier. The reaction is conducted usually at a temperature of from 0 to 100 C. The catalyst may be present from the initial stage, or may be added after the preparation of an oligomer, followed by further polymerization. For the copolymerization of the above mentioned copolymerizable compound with a diol having at least one pendant aromatic group, there may be employed a a method wherein they may be simultaneously reacted with phosgene and polymerized, b a method wherein one of them is firstly reacted with phosgene, and after the reaction has proceeded to some extent, the other compound is introduced for polymerization, or c a method wherein the two compounds are reacted with phosgene separately to produce the respective oligomers, which are then reacted for polymerization. As a method for mixing the polymers separately prepared, there may be mentioned a method wherein the respective powders or granules are mixed, and then melt mixed by means of e.g. an extruder, a kneader or mixing rolls, or a solution blending method. The polycarbonate to be used in the present invention has an average molecular weight M In the above formulas, c is the polymer concentration g liter , η is the intrinsic viscosity, K is 0.28, K is 1.23 x 10 ⁵, α is 0.83, and M is the average molecular weight. Namely, if the average molecular weight is less than 9,500, the mechanical properties will be inferior, and if the average molecular weight exceeds 14,000, it will be difficult to obtain a molding material having a minimum optical distortion. When the polycarbonate of the present invention is to be molded, it is preferred to add from 0.01 to 2 by weight of a phosphite to the resin, whereby the coloring or the deterioration of transparency due to the decomposition of the resin can be controlled. As such a phosphite, there may be mentioned tributyl phosphite, tri 2 ethylhexyl phosphite, tridecyl phosphite, tristearyl phosphite, triphenyl phosphite, tricresyl phosphite, 2 ethylhexyldiphenyl phosphite, decyldiphenyl phosphite, tricylohexyl phosphite or distearyl pentaerythrityl diphosphite. Such a phosphite may be incorporated by dry blending, by melt mixing at the time of pelletizing by means of an extruder, or by preparing master pellets having a high phosphite concentration and dry blending them with pellets containing no phosphite. The molding material of the present invention is a polycarbonate resin which has excellent heat resistance and optical characteristics and which is capable of being molded by melt molding, and thus is useful for the production of an optical information material such as an optical disc, lens or optical fiber. The polycarbonate of the present invention is particularly useful as a material for the optical disc. The optical disc here includes a disc for replay only such as a compact disc or a laser disc, a write once type disc useful for a document file, a still image file or a moving image file, and an erasable type disc such as a photomagnetic disc. The present invention is particularly useful for e.g. the erasable optical disc where the heat resistance is particularly important. The Examples illustrate specific manners for the preparation of the polycarbonates of the present invention and their oligomers. In the Examples, the parts represents parts by weight . The resin obtained in each Example or Comparative Example was, after an addition of 130 ppm of 2 ethylhexyl diphenylphosphite, molded into a disc having a thickness of 1.2 mm and a diameter of 10 cm at a molding temperature of 340 C by means of a 1 ounce 28,35 g injection molding machine manufactured by Nissei Jushi under the molding conditions identified in Table 1. At the same time, the apparent melt viscosity ηa was measured at 280 C at a shear rate of 10³ sec ¹ by a flow tester, and used as a reference for the melt flow characteristics.
