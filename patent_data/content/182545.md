# SLURRY ATOMIZER

## Abstract
An atomizing nozzle for use with high viscosity slurries has a body 10 and a forming element 40 including passage ways 18, 22 and 48 that lead to a conical chamber 65 hav ing a discharge annulus 66 . The slurry exits the discharge an nulus 66 in a cylindrical continuous film. The inside of the film is exposed to swirled, compressed gas from an internal bore 50 of the forming element 40 and the outside of the film is exposed to swirled compressed gas in a swirl chamber 72 to atomize and mix the slurry.
