# Catalyst for producing alcohols from olefins and synthesis gas.

## Abstract
The present invention concerns a catalyst with which alcohols can be produced directly in one step by a hydrofor mylation reaction olefin H₂ CO alcohol . The catalyst comprises a mixture of two monometal cluster compounds Rh₄ CO ₁₂ and Co₄ CO ₁₂ which is bound on a solid catalyst carrier.
