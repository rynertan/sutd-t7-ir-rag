# Apparatus for registration and control of a moving web and method of operating such apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for pouch forming, filling and sealing a printed web 12 , having registration marks 16 at locations where transverse seals 15 are to be formed in order to form a pouch, is fed through drive rolls 20 over a plow 21 which forms a longitudinal fold 22 in the web around a sealing wheel 25 having lands 26 which the web contacts to form transverse pouch forming seals around a filler 27 where product is poured into the pouches past a top sealer 28 and a cutoff where the pouch forming is completed and the individual pouches are severed by knives. A photoelectric scanner 39 scans the registration marks and produces a pulse when each passes the scanner. An electric eye 32 cooperating with a disk 30 driven by the machine deter mines the position of the sealer lands. A tachometer 35 driven by the machine produces pulses proportional to the speed of the machine. A stepping motor 36 continuously drives the drive rolls. The outputs from the photoelectric scanner, the electric eye and the tachometer are used in association with a microprocessor 40 for controlling the position of the registration marks with respect to the lands so as to form transverse seals on the pouches between the printed matter associated with each pouch.
