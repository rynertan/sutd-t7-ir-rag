# NORMALLY OFF SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE WITH LOW ON RESISTANCE AND CIRCUIT ANALOGUE

## Abstract
A semiconductor device incorporates a JFET serially connected to a bipolar transistor to achieve normally off operation. An impedance element is connected between the base of the bipolar transistor and the gate of the JFET, which serves as a single control electrode for the entire device. When a current is supplied to the control electrode, the bipolar transistor and JFET are both switched to the on state. In the JFET, the p N junction between the gate region and the channel region is sufficiently forward biased so as to inject current carriers into its channel region and markedly reduce the device on resistance. An electrical circuit analogue of the device achieves the advantage of low on resistance and normally off operation.
