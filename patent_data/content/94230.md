# Improvements in internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
There is provided the combination of a stationary frame, a stationary sun gear on the frame, and a rotary frame pivoted about the axis of the sun gear. The rotary frame carries three crankshafts at substantially 120 intervals, and for each crankshaft there is provided a cylinder in the rotary frame, and a piston mounted for reciprocation in each cylinder. Each crankshaft is fixed to rotate with a respective planetary gear and all planetary gears mesh with the sun gear and have the same pitch diameter as the sun gear. Thus, any point on the pitch circle of a planetary gear describes a cardioid as the planetary gear rotates around the sun gear once. The crank shaft eccentricity is about one third of the pitch radius of a planetary gear, and each piston has a connecting link to its respective crankshaft. Fuel metering means, such as a car burettor, are provided for delivering a combustible mixture to the cylinders. Ignition means are provided to ignite the combustible mixture, and valve means are present for admit ting a combustible mixture to each cylinder and exhausting combustion gases therefrom.
