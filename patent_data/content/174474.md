## Description
RELEASE AGENT APPLICATOR BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to devices for applying a release agent, and more particularly to devices for applying a release agent in fixing devices of plain paper copiers and facsimiles.2. Description of the Prior Art As illustrated in FIGURES 1, 2A and 2B, it is conventional in a plain paper copier or a facsimile to fix a toner image 10 on a sheet 12 by passing sheet 12 between an elastic roller 14 and a fixing roller 16 heated by heater 18. To prevent sticking problems, a release agent, usually silicone oil, is conventionally applied to fixing roller. Conventional release agent applicators may include either a heat resistant felt 20 impregnated with the release agent as shown in FIGURE 1 or a porous polytetrafluoroethylene tube 22 filled with release agent 28 as shown in FIGURES 2A and 2B. A layer 24 of material that closes pores in tube 22 surrounds all of tube 22 except the portion that contacts fixing roller 16. Tube 22 may be carried by a support plate 26. Either of these applicators may be of the disposable type. The conventional release agent applicators described above have the following problems. Heat resistant felt applicator 20, illustrated in FIGURE 1, has a relatively short life i.e., only about 10,000 copies are obtained from a fixing roll fed with the release agent by applicator 20 . Tower or paper particles deposited on the felt surface either prevent further application of the silicone oil or damage the surface of the fixing roller.Also, the amount of cil applied in the initial period is so great as to cause frequent staining of the copy paper. The overall shape and construction of the porous tube applicator illustrated in FIGURES 2A and 2B are complex because this applicator requires its peripheral portion to be masked, its two ends to be sealed, and the provision of air vents. Also, oil leakage may occur during transportation or storage of the applicator or upon standing after it is set in the copier. SUE PLY OF THE INVENTION The present invention eliminates these problems associated with conventional release agent applicators.The applicator of the present invention includes a solid, or non hollow, porous body of a fluoropolymer that is impregnated with a release agent. The porous body may have a round, rectangular or triangular cross section. The body applies release agent by being pressed against the fixing roller. By using a solid porous body of a fluoropolymer impregnated with a release agent, the present invention enables simple and uniform application of the release agent. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS These and other objects in advantages of this invention will become more apparent and more readily appreciated from the following detailed description of the presently preferred exemplary embodiment of this invention, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, of which FIGURE 1 is a schematic illustration of one conventional applicator as incorporated in a fixing apparatus FIGURE 2A is a front elevational view of another conventional applicator FIGURE 2B is a cross sectional view of the applicator of FIGURE 2A FIGURE 3A is a bottom plan view of an applicator in accordance with the present invention FIGURE 3B is a side elevational view of the applicator of FIGURE 3A FIGURE 3C is a front elevational view of the applicator of FIGURE 3A FIGURES4A, 4B and 4C are cross sectional views of d erent porous bodies that may be used in an applicator according to the present invention FIGURE 5 is a schematic illustration of a fixing apparatus incorporating an applicator in accordance with the present invention and FIGURE 6 is a graph showing an amount of silicone oil applied from the applicator of the present invention as a function of the number of copies obtained. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS As illustrated in FIGURES 3A 3C, an applicator in accordance with one embodiment of this invention includes a solid, or non hollow, porous body 30 of a fluoropolymer such as polytetrafluoroethylene Poreflon of SumitomoElectric Industries, Ltd. set in a housing 32 which serves as a support member. Housing 32 is made of metal or a heat resistant plastic polypllffln5Jlene sulfide PPS , or polybutylene terephthalate PBT . Porous body 30 of fluoropolymer is impregnated with a release agent such as silicone oil. The impregnation is not made to the state of its saturation, otherwise the release agent may ooze out due to its expansion at increased temperature.To prevent any shrinkage that may occur during service, both ends of porous fluropolymer body 30 are secured to housing 32 by bolts 34 or other suitable means. As desired, porous body 30 may be impregnated with release agent prior to or after being set in housing 32. Porous body 30 is fabricated by extrusion techniques and may be provided with a variety of cross sectional shapes such as shown in FIGURES 4A 4C, depending upon the shape of the extrusion die used. The porosity of body 30 is preferably in the range of 25 85 . The viscosity of the release agent, typically silicone oil, may preferably be in the range of 500 100,000 cs depending upon the required amount of oil to be applied. The more preferred viscosity range is from 1,000 to 50,000 cs. The oil may be impregnated in body 30 by simply submerging it in the oil. If quick impregnation is desired, the oil may be heated or placed in a vacuum atmosphere. One more detailed example of the applicator in accordance with the present invention will now be described in order to facilitate a better understanding of the invention. A porous 80 porosity body 30 of polytetrafluoroethylene having a width W of 12 mm and a thickness t of 7 mm was prepared by either of the methods described in Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 42 13560 and 58 15295, and cut to a length L of 30 cm. After impregnation with about 15 g of silicone oil KF 96 of Shinetsu ChemicalIndustry Cho., Ltd., viscosity 3,000 cs , body 30 was secured to housing 32 at both ends by bolts 34 and set in a fixing apparatus as illustrated in FIGURE 5. Fixing roller 16 in FIGURE 5 had such a rotating speed as to process 12 sheets of paper 21 cm x 29.7 cm per minute.Applicator 40 in accordance with the present invention was pressed against fixing roller 16 by leaf spring 42 attached to heater cover 44. Paper guide 13 guided paper between rollers 16 and 14. The amount of silicone oil applied from applicator 40 for every 5,000 copies was measured and the results are shown in FIGURE 6. It can be seen that the application of the oil remained fairly uniform up to the copying of 30,000 sheets. Toner or paper particles transferred from fixing roller 16 to the surface of porous fluoropolymer body 30 could be easily cleaned off and no clogging of the pores occurred. One economic aspect of the device of the present invention is that the cumulative consumption of oil for copying 30,000 sheets was only about 5 g. The release agent applicator in accordance with the present invention is advantageous in that it has a very long service life and can be used virtually permanently by repeating the impregnation with silicone oil.Also it applies a uniform and small quantity of the oil from the beginning to the end of service. No cil staining of the copy paper occurs in the initial period of application. The applicator has a simple configuration and oil is retained in the pores in he fluoropolymer by capillary action, so no oil leak will occur during transportion or storage, or even upon standing after setting the device in the fixing apparatus. Although only a few exemplary embodiments of this invention have been described in detail above, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modi fications are possible in the preferred errbodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of this invention. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.
