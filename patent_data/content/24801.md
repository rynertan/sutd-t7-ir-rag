# One piece dispensing closure.

## Abstract
A one piece dispensing closure consists of a cut shaped cap 12 having means 15 for retaining it on the neck of a container and a lid 13 which is connected by an integral hinge 14 to the cap at one edge thereof and which is adapted to be swung over on top of the cap. There are openings 18,19,23 through the top of the cap and through the lid, one of which is closed by a stopper element 22 when the lid is swung over and pressed down into closed position against the top of the cap. The relative positions and sizes of the opening in the lid and the stopper element are such that the stopper is withdrawn from the opening when the lid is lifted angularly a short distance to open position by raising the edge of the lid opposite the hinge connection. The cap and lid have co operating means 35,36 for limiting the normal, upward, angular movement of the lid away from closed portion to open position.
