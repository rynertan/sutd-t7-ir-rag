# Soil cultivating implements.

## Abstract
A soil cultivating implement which comprises a row of power driven rotary soil working members is provided, behind said soil working members with respect to the intended direction of operative travel of the implement, with a freely rotatable roller 10 having a cylindrical carrier 11 and a plurality of projections 12 formed in integral pairs and arranged in groups or crowns at regularly spaced apart intervals along the intended axis of rotation a of the roller 10 . In order substantially to prevent clods of earth, old roots and the like from becoming jammed between the groups or crowns of projections 12 , the relatively facing sides of the groups or crowns skeletally define radially outwardly divergent surfaces B and a pointed scraper 17 bears against the carrier 11 between each group or crown of projections 12 . The projections 12 are secured to the carrier 11 by welding seams that extend parallel or substantially parallel to the axis a and alternative constructions of the projections are both described and illustrated.
