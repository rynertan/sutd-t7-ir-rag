# AUTOMATIC GAIN CONTROL CIRCUIT

## Abstract
An automatic gain control circuit 10 is provided for limiting the positive and negative peaks of an input wave form. A differential pair of PNP transistors 52, 56 are coupled to the collector of an NPN amplifying transistor 16 for activating a limiting means 62, 66, 68, 70 on negative peaks of the input waveform as the amplifying transistor approaches cutoff. On positive peaks, a second emitter 34 of the amplifying transistor acts as a collector drawing electrons injected into the base from the collector. A reverse current through the emitter acitvates the limiting means. The limiting means is coupled to the input terminal for limiting the positive and negative peaks beyond a predetermined level.
