## Description
The present invention relates to a battery charging system. It has previously been proposed to utilize two batteries in an engine starter motor system. The batteries are either connected permanently in series and charged with a transformer, d.c. to d.c. converter, or voltage doubler arrangement providing charge current to the added battery, or a series parallel switch arrangement is used to connect the batteries in parallel for charging and in series for starting. The former arrangement can be expensive and unreliable and the latter may interfere with the proper charging of the main battery if the switch arrangement is not of very high quality. The present invention seeks to overcome these drawbacks in a simple and efficaceous manner. A battery charging system in accordance with the invention comprises a main battery, a generator permanently connected to said main battery for maintaining the latter charged, an auxiliary battery, diode means permanently connected to the auxiliary battery and to the generator so that the auxiliary battery is charged by the generator, a starter switch, a relay connected to be energised when said starter switch is actuated, said relay having a contact connecting the auxiliary battery in series with the main battery across a starter motor, without interrupting the connection formed by said diode means between the auxiliary battery and the generator. In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a circuit diagram of an embodiment of the invention, and Figures 2, 3 and 4 are diagrams of possible modifications. Referring to Figure 1, the circuit shown therein, includes an alternator stator winding 110 of the three phase type, associated with a main rectifier 111 and an auxiliary rectifier 112. The main rectifier 111 connects the winding 110 through a first supply line 107 and a second supply line 108 to a main 12V battery 113 and the auxiliary rectifier supplies 112 power through a third supply line 109 to a field winding 114 controlled, as is usual, by a voltage regulator 115. A warning lamp 130 and an ignition switch 131 are connected, in series, between the first and third supply lines, the lamp being energised whenever the alternator is producing no output. An auxiliary 12V battery 116 is connected to the alternator by four diodes 117 through a fourth supply line 121 and a fifth supply line 122 so that it is kept charged by two phases of the alternator output. A starter switch 118 is connected to the positive pole of the main battery 113 and controls a relay winding 119 which has a single normally open contact 119a connecting the negative pole of battery 116 to the positive pole of battery 113. The switch 118 also connects the positive pole of battery 113 to a further relay winding 132 which controls the current to a starter solenoid 120 winding or findings which incorporates, as is usual, main starter contacts in series with the starter motor 127. The contacts of relay 132 and the contacts of the solenoid 120 in series connect the motor 127 to the positive pole of battery 116 so that when they close the motor 127 is connected to a 24V supply. In use, the two batteries 113 and 119 are fully isolated from one another by their independent rectifier diodes. Both are charged by the alternator, the battery 116 receiving less charge current than the battery 113 because it is not required to supply other loads. On closing of the starter switch 118, relay 119 operates to connect batteries 113 and 116 in series, and energise the solenoid 120. In the modification shown in Figure 2 the starter solenoid 220 is modified by having separate external connections for its winding s and its contacts. The contacts of relay 132, in this case, are connected in series with the solenoid windings, but a direct connection to the solenoid contacts from the battery 116 is provided. In this case the relay 132 contacts do not have to carry starter current. In the modification shown in Figure 3 only two diodes 217 are used in place of the four diodes 117 of Figure 2.In Figure 4 there are three diodes 317 instead of diodes 117.
