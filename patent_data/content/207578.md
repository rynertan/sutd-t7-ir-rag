# Multibit hand tool.

## Abstract
A multibit hand tool has a plurality of bits 30 provided in a circular pattern within a handle magazine. A rotatable selec tor cup 14 at the end 16 of the handle 12 permits selection of a desired bit 30 from the magazine and placement in a chuck 72 in the handle. An elongate slot 46 is provided in the cup 14 to permit the manipulation of the bit 30 . An improved guidance arrangement 68 is provided for guiding movement of a bit 30 withdrawn from the handle magazine for insertion in the chuck 72 . The guide device 68 prevents rotation of the screwdriver bit 30 while being transferred from the magazine to the chuck 72 . An improved arrange ment is provided for retaining a bit withdrawn from the handle magazine within the bit selector cup 14 so that bits 30 are not lost. The mounting of the bit selector cup on the handle is improved to facilitate assembly and use of the bit selector cup.
