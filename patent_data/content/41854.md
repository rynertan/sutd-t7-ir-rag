# A method of mechining a three dimensional curved surface.

## Abstract
The invention involves generating a curved surface of a body including the steps of generating a plurality of inter mediate sections 14, 15 and locating a section curve 14a, 15a in each of the intermediate sections 14, 15, in accordance with predetermined rules, from section data specifying given sec tions 11, 12 of the body and from data specifying section curves 11a, 12a in respective ones of the given sections 11,12. The curved surface c of the body comprises the sum of the located intermediate section curves e.g. 14a, 15a in the gen erated intermediate sections e.g. 14,15 .
