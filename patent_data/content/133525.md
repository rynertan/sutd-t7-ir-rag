# TURBO DISTRIBUTOR FOR GRANULATED PRODUCTS FOR FERTILIZATION AND SEEDING

## Abstract
Fitted on the tractor, the device automatically performs the distribution of granulated products on the ground for fertilization and seeding according to two subsequent im pulses of aerodynamic thrust the first of which projects the product outwards and the subsequent one increases its falling space. The initial impulse is given to the product in free fall, on the sill of a supply duct turned upwards, by an air jet which makes use of a very small part of a winnowing fan power the subsequent impulse by the remaining air jet coming out from a duct below the previous one and with an analogous direction. The invented device enables to increase the space of trow for the product fall in comparison with the present systems working with only a single air jet.
