## Description
Title of the inventions Disk Displacement No shift SpeederSummary of the invention The present invention provides for a Disk Displacement No Shift Speeder device, characteristically it means to in a timely control of the pneumatic systems by means of a microcomputerized processing of factors such as Engine Rotation Speeds travelling speeds, Acceleration conditions plus gear shifting status quo by transmission of the Disk by virtue of the 4.Displacement as accomplished, such that the cone gear set will follow up in transmission accordingly so that Blocks will be driven to determine the extent to which the Disk is to be set to displacement so as to rot ate about the main axis of the Engine so as to carry the Disk to exert a push upon the Links, to follow that, a one way wheel will produce a push against the affected shaft sleeve thereby theEngine momentum is discharged, and that as.the travelling speed of the vehicle provided accordingly reaches a certain rate, the micro processor will function again to stop the indirect transmission by the eccentric displacement of the Disk and in the meantime to have the transmission momentum delivered straight by the Main Shaft of the Engine thus achieving in a substantial save of the fuels consumable due to sear shifting and variation in speed as a result thereof as a vehicle is travelling en route, and in the meanwhile, the shocks to be produced during a gear shifting performance will be eliminated accordingly.

Conventionally, the gear shifting mechanism as provided for automobiles and land vehicles are executed in manual operation a prerequisite for such an arrangement is that the driver be thoroughly familiar with driving skills, specifically0 the driver will have to step upon the clutch with the left foot, upon the accelerator with the right foot, and to handle with the hand the gear lever all at the same time in order that a coordinated effect together with the steering wheel under control will achieve combines state desired to secure a save and expedient driving all the times, the pity, however, is that in transmission structure it is obliged to rely on smoothening units comprising clutches or fluid joints or oDnnectors in coordination with shiftwise. transmission gear sets to achieve in traction transports, such that in mcnents when the vehicle has to be set at idle speeds with flame on, the driver will have to turn the clutch onto the first Ger before the Engine rpm can be increased, to follow that, the clutch will have to be properly controlled so that the vehicle may be set to run up in a sure manner, when it comes that it is necessary to change to the Intermediate Gear, it is then required to slow down the Engine rpm firstly ancl then to step upon the Clutch, in a state of engagement, as it turned to be established in the IntermediateGear, the Engine r may be increased once again, the Clutch being engaged, the vehicle gues on running, the result is that the energy needed to bring the Engine run up from the idle speed will be much more than would be the case to maintain it running at a constant rate, what is more, the Engine, in situations sensing a drastic drop in speed like the present case, would result in subjecting the absorptive suctions resulting from the vacuum to exist when intake mainfold in the carburetor is at idling speeds to put fuels that would not have to be consumed in an ideal case to combustion in the Engine as well thus causing a gross waste of fuels, to improve the inconveni. nces elue to conventional manual gear shifting operations a hvuraulie automatic Gear Transmission device came to be know, which truly proves easier for operation, its structural principles and styles of operation prove to be energy consuming at the same time, because it adopts a fluid connector in place of the manual gear transmission clutch the fluid connector itself is not involved in Direct Contact Transmission, resulting in a gross loss of transmission at rotation, on the other hand. its gear transmission structure is based on the combination of multiple nets of clutches and planary Gear sets, complicated in construction and will rely on Engine running to secure hydraulic pressures with which to achieve in transmission operation runnings, in addition, the gear transridssion thereby depends entirely upon plane contacts of the clutch pieces for transmission, which will easily incur sliding losses arct is therefore not suitable for use with heavy load vehicles such as Trucks an Trailers, all in all. the shortcomings of the latel lnown hydraulic gear transmission device can be summarized as follows 1 Poorer transmission loading capacity as compared with conventional manual gear transmission operations 2 Hicher energy consumption rates as compared with conventional manual gear transmission operations 3 Restricted of scope of application to de luxe stylish sedans only, not ideal for general purpose heavy loach trucks or light weight cars. So a conclusion can he drawn that last mentioned hydraulic gear transmission device is in no way superior to the conventional mental gear transmission systems which are still the.mainstream as employed in vehicles found in Auto Markets and in streets everywhere this very well reflects the concern for an optimal improvements to solve the dilemma that a higher fuel consumption would be inevitable with a more convenient operation for the driver, or else more labour, mental and physicalwill have to be discharged to run a car if priority is placed on an economical use of the precious fuels. The primary objective of the present invention, it is, in view of the shortcomings found with both the conventional manual transmission technique and the later known hydraulic transmissions to provide a Disk Displacemont No Shift Speeder after an in depth, thorough study of all known defects experienced heretofore in driving practices by drivers everywhere, Which.w ll not only achieve in substantial save of precious fuels that would be consumed unwisely and needlessly otherwise, but also achieve in save of human labour discharged in the execution of a gear transmission by the provision of a ventilation hole that goes deep into the intake manifold on the realization that suction will be produced by an intake effect to take place in the intake manifold as the vehicle Engine is set to rotation running, such that the suctions are used to control a clutch in transmission with a transmission shaft so that a coInpressor therefor will be driven to produce air pressure for storage in a power storage vessel which servos as a readily available energy to be integrated into a micrc computer processed system prepared specifically according to the subject invention so that the brake may be transmitted in a timely manner so as to carry the Disk 0displaced to an extent under control so as to set the journey of transmission by the Links to transmit the Disk under control so that the one way rotation wheel will bs driven to transmit the affected shaft sleeve with the EngineTransmission thus achieving eventually a gear transmission,through direct traction produced for the vehicle in an automatic operation with a substantial save of fuels So it is clear that another objective of the present invention it is to provicte a Disk Displacement No Shift Speeder device complete with a base gear of a very low rating which wily yield a tremendous torsion for heavy loaded vehicles to assist in climbing uphill. Still another objective of the present invention it is to provide an energy saving Disk Displacement no shift Speeder as a traction device complete with a base gear of a very low rating that will serve to activate the vehicle by accelerating the Engine runninq to an rpm as low as 700 rpm thus achieving in the optiutal application of even a single drop of gasoline fuel as opposed to the conventional cases where activation is not likely until the running of Engine reaches up to 1300 rpm. What follows is a detailed account of the structural characteristics, performance merits, and operation principles of the present invention with reference to the attached confiu,rat ion of drawings thereof To better help in the understanding, the description will go for two executions of the present invention respectively. the present invention consists essentially of a Disk Displacement No shift spider as illustrated in Fig. 1 Fig. 2, together with a Micro processor which gathers and dispose of the informations covering Engine rp, travelling speed, acceleration condition, neutral gearing, ant other relevant ones set by the driver, together with those covered by a Direct transmission shift or an indirect transmission shift, the disposition will serve as the basis in accordance with which the extent to which the Disk is to be displaced by the mechaninal svatem that is controlled by the Commanding Pneumatic Power system in en effort to perform the switchover exchange related to a transmission, direct or indirect. What is given in Fig. 1 is an embodiment of the Disk Displacement No shift Speeder device in the first instance, comprising three sets of Links 11 equi angularly fit with respect to each other, which may come in multiple sets fit in multiple but equal angular settings if preferred, the one way rotation wheels 12 in common transmission and affected shaft sleeve 13 engagecl thereto, the other end of the Links 11 being laid and retained in the annular grooveway 101 provided at the bottom of the transmission lisk 10 so that the gear 1 on the Engine Main Shaft will be in a position to give transmissions to the Gear Shaft Sleeve 17 so as to bring the Rotation Disk 18 into rotation as required, the other end of the Rotation Disk is attached to a support formwork by means of a Shaft Sleeve 189 50 as to help realize a stable rotation of the r isk 18 which will bring the J isk 10 to rotation as well, further to taht, the displacement of the lisk 10 arranged to this effect will realize a transmission simulating that of an Eccentric that which will bring . the Clinic 11 to rotation in step with the eccentricity of the r 10 at any a given moment, to the effect that the one way rotation wheel 12 in transmission with the Link 11 will give thrust to th shaft sleeve 13 to bring forth a rotative effect such that two transmission gears 191 192 as engaged to the Clutch 19 will yield rotations contrary to each other by the action of a guide 195 , the idea here i s that by the execution of the selection option lever 193 for coupling to the clutching gear 194 that is in transmission with the output shaft 1B to attain an engagement with or else disengagement from the two tranamission gear. 191 192 it is made possible to set the output shaft 1B to rotate in the positive or reverse direction or else to hold still, thus achieving the performance of a forward gear catch, reverse gear catch, or neutral catch in operation accordingly, the functions of the clutch is identical to regular ones and is therefore omitted for discription, in this manner, it is made possible to attain an indirect delivery of the output of the Main . Shaft Gear 1 , that 1s the engine rpm with a relatively laggZr torsion with which to achieve in the activation, namely, the atartup of the vehicle, the assumption of a heavy load under lower travelling speeds, and in an added power output of help in a climbing uphill. sçhat is given in Fig. 1 B is a sectionwise perspective of an illustration of the processing just characterized above, wherefrom it is clearly obvious that two screws 182 as provided in the grooveway 181 within the Rotation Disk 18 will. rotate in step with the Rotation Disk 18 so long as the Disk 18 is in rotation, the shaft levers 184 185 will therefore follow up in a synchronized rotation with the Rotation Disk 18 when the rotation of the two screws 182 come to engagement with the cone shaped gear set 183 on passing by one end thereof, one terminal shaft 812 t822 of the brake 811 821 being fitted respectively .to a film öls 823 as provided in a closed enclosure 81 82 the.other end thereof serves to give access to a power storage vessel tlwough the madium of ducts 14 824 by coupling, such that when the Micro processor controlled intake solenoid 815 is open to let in air pressures to be stored in the power storage vessel via duct 84 , the film 8l3, will be bent to give rise to a displacement of the brake 811 so as to get into contact with the shaft lever 184 , the terminal shaft 812 being provided with a grooveway that will come into engagement with a fix but projecting stem 816 in order that the film 813 be kept free from damage due to rotation of the brake in step with shaft lever 184 , the result is a slowing down in the rotation speed of the shaft lever 184 , to the effect that the rotation shaft 184 would no longer maintain a synchronized rotation with the Rotation Disk 18 , the speed differential to take place accordingly would serve to bring the gear set 183 to an engagement transmission that which will set the screw 182 to rotation as well, to follow that, the match of the threads on the screw 182 to the female threads on the blocks 186 187 will produce a situation wherein the sliding blocks 186 187 will transmit both the eaisk 10 and counterbalances 188 to deviate towards the outside, such that a spring 817 will set the film 813 hacK to recovery when the intake solenoid valve 815 is at closure, the same situation, if happened to the closed enclosure 82 , will carry the transmission dislt 10 and the counterbalance weights 188 to displace centripetally, the gravitation due to the counterbalance weights shall be such as to mate with that due to the transmission disk 10 So as to ensure the stability of the rotation disk 18 at rotation. The sliding displacement of the çounterbolance weights 188 and the transmission disk 10 will take place alongside the grooveway 171 and the dovetail groove 172 respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 1 Ap to secure stability the entire operation, a la ger deviation of the transmission disk 10 will mean a larger amplitude to sweep back and forth by the transmission of the Link 11 that is driven by the centrifugal eccentric deviation, and consequently the one way rotation shaft 12 in transmission with the Link 11 will produce a larger stroke of journey to be transmitted by the affected shaft sleeve 13 , in addition, three one way rotation wheels will continually bring rotative thrust against the affected, that is, the recipient shaft sleeve so that the output rpm of the same will increase steadily. What is shown in Fig. 4 is the interior construction of the one way rotation wheel 12 , the one way rotation by transmission as achieved therefor is due to the s transmission effects to be produced when the dental intervals 124 produced by the depth differential between both ends of the interior rim edge of the external gear 123 and the rotation wheel 122 in transmission with the central axis 121 thereof are checked by a rolling stem 126 that is controlled by a spring 125 , referring now to Fig.4A it is seen that when the rotation wheel 122 is set to rotation in the clockwise direction, the rolling stem 126 will then be transmitted by the thrusts from the spring 125 and the frictions due to rotation,wheel 122 , it will as a result progress in the clockwise direction as well and exert a secured tight.up holding contact somewhere between the dental interval 124 and the rotation wheel 122 such that a common transmission will take place for both the rotation wheel 122 and the External Gear 123 which will be subject to rotation in the clockwise direction under the transmission of rotation wheel 122 , on the contrary, should the rotation of the rotation wheel 122 be executed in the counterclockwise direction, then the rolling stem t126 will be pushed to displace in the counterclockwise direction instead, rather than producing a tight up joint transmission, the External Gear 123 will therefore abstain from following in rotation whatever, reference at this puncture is called to Fig. 4J3. What follows is a description of another embodiment of the present invention titled Disk Displacement no shift speeder device in the second instance for which a three dimensional perspective is given in Fig. 2A a sectionwise perspective given in Fig. 2B which is distinguished from the embodiment in the first instance by the replacement of a transmission disk in place of the counter balancing weights.From Fia. 2B it is clear that the Rotation Disk 18 is subject to a synchronized rotation through engagement transmission by the Main Axis 1A via the annular dental rov 180v provided midway, when that happens, two screws 182 as provided in the grooveway within will likewise, follow the rotation disk 18 in rotations in the meantime, the mesh up action to turn up in the conical gear set 183 will serve to transmit the shaft sleeve 184 to a rotation in synchronism with the rotation disk 18 , now when the film 311 in the air tight enclosure 31 should yield wavelike pulsations under the action of the presence of pneumatic pressures, then a displacement will be seen of the Link 312 , which will bring the Clutch 1 to get into engagement with or else disengagement from the shaft sleeve 184 and the transmission shaft sleeve 32 respectively accordingly while it is in engagement with the shaft sleeve 184 , the shaft sleeve 184 and the Main Axis 1A of the Engine will be driven thereby to come to a synchronized rotation in step with the rotation disk 18 , such that, the screw 182 will be set to a passive condition, on the other handy when the Clutch 1 is ngaget with the transmission shaft sleeve 32 to act to drive the transmission shaft s 32 into synchronized rotation with the Engine Main Axis 1A , then what follows forthwith is that shaft sleeve 184 will further be transmitted by the gear unit 33 to result in a change of the rotation speed of rotation sleeve 104 reflecting in speed differential with respect to the rotation disk 18 , unable to catch up with the rotation speed of the screw 182 , in other words, the acrew 182 will be set to rotation by the mesh in actions of the conical gear set 1835 , what with the owwup actions of the two sliding blocks 186 187 as acrewed unto the screw 182 through threads couplings it will achieve in bringing the two transmission disks 10 186 as in connection therewith and as laid secured to either end of the rotation disk 18 , respectively by means of a dovetail groove to deviate centrifugally or else centripetally at the same time, thus accowplishing.the extent of deviation of the transmission disk. 188 , as regards the rotation speed that should come faster or else slower than that of the rotation disk, to be generated by the shaft sleeve 184 under the transmission of the gear unit 33 , it is to be accomplished by a transmission diffurential by virtue of the engagement or disengagement of two differently sized transmissio,n gear 331 332 with respect to a Clutching Gear 321 that is. under the control of another air tight enclosure 34 in the execution of a mesh up activation with transmission shaft sleeve 32 as the other party, the coordinated control Of the air tight enclosure with respect to the pneumatic systems will be account for later in the text, For the execution in the second instance under discuSsione there are provided four sets of transmission links 11 lined up in like angular intervals and four sets of one way rotation wheels 12 lined up likewise, with a gear 122 being in mesh with the central point of the four one way rotation wheels mentioned above to make up a transmission, the counterpart four wheels underneath will altogether mesh up a recipient shaft sleeve 13 , in addition, one corresponding pair of one way rotation wheel Up and down are meshed together by means of a gear shaft lever 121 in order that the pushing thrust as produced by the. Link and thR one vay rotation wheel overhead will also be available for exertion unto the recipient shaft sleeve 13 through the transmission of the gear shaft lever 121 , such that the construction according to the subject invention will turn out double thrusts for the recipient shaft sleeve.The Engagement Clutch 19 is the same as that for the embodiment in the first instance in structure nd perforeance, Referring now to Fig. 2B, Fig. SA and Fig , it is seen of a one way rotation wheel fixed to the top of the recipient shaft sleeve 13 characterized in that the external wheel 123 to the one way rotation wheel 131 is in connection with the recipient shaft sleeve 13 whereas the central shaft 121 is linked to the Engine Main Axis lA , with perforating holes provide across the wall of the external wheel, complete with an insertion pin 127 with a tilted front end, to be designed to take the form of a cone or of a bumper so that it may not fly out due to centrifugal forces, each insertion pin shall be capable of controlling a rolling stem 126 whilst the insertion pin itself is secured in position with a toggle 132 such as given in Fig. 2B, when the rotation speed of the recipient shaft sleeve 13 hu not yet reached the rotation speed set for a Direct Transmission, then the toggle 132 , under the push by a bending interior film 134 as provided in the enclosure 133 , will catch onto the outside of the one way rotation wheel to produce a situation whor the insertion pin 127 will be pushed inwards to . cert thrusts. 4 upon the rolling stem 126 50 that the latter will not come into contact with the dental notch, 124 of the external wheel, as obvious front Fig. 5A, whereupon no effects will be released front the one way rotation wheel, when it turns out that the rotation speed, that is, the vehicle speed reaches the designed Direct Transmission Speed, the Micro processor will then function to set the film 134 back to position such that the toggle 132 will part from the one way rotation wheel, whereupon the insertion pin 127 will ascend under the thrust due to spring 125 thereby releasing control of the rolling stem 126 so that the external wheel 123w would move forth clockwise, and eventually get wound up closely laid up in,betwe8n dental notch 124 and the rotation wheel 122 , as may be seen from Fig. 503, the result is that the external wheel 123 would come to a synchronized rotation in step with the central shaft 121 , that is, the recipient shaft sleeve 13 will be transmitted straight by the Engine Main i,s 1A , in the meantime, a substantial save of power in the course of an indirect transmission is achieved because of the recovery of the transmission disk 10 18 through control by the Microprocessor.Under conditions where a direct transmission prevails, should vehicle speed come much in excess than the speed rate set for t direct transmission that which results in a rotation speed of the recipient shaft sleeve 13 . that is faster than the sal. due to the Engine Main Axis 1A , no unfavorable impacts whatever would be brought to the Engine all the same thanks to the structure designed for the one way rotation wheel under the present invention0 In view of the fact that a vehicle will use a lot of fufl in going from startup all the way to the en route cruising speed, in taking a braking action or in setting the accelerator at full, rating that which will bring very undesirable effects to to Engn for the present invention there is provided a power recovery device 2 on the vehicle transmission shaft 1A such as is shown in Fig. 3At to serve to conserve energy derived from power losses to occur when the vehicle turns abruptly from a high speed to a lower travelling speed for use as an effective energy source instead. in substance, it means to have clutch belt wheel 21 driven by transmission shaft belt whee 16 by means of a frictional clutch 20 . now as the shaft core 220 on one end of the frictional.rotation wheel 22 is attached to a film 231 that is provided in an air t4ght enclosure 23 whereas the other end of the air tight enclosure 23 is connected to the Engine admission manifold with duct 232 , so that.the vacuum suction occurring to the mdmission manifold when the Engine drops from a higher speed to the idling speed will serve to cause a deviation of the shaft core 220 of the rotation wheel 22 so that the rotation disk 221 in connection with the shaft core 220 will consummate in a pressured contact with the interior wall 222 of the rotation wheel 22 which will therefo.e follow in rotation ir step with the belt wheel 16 of the . ransmlsslon shaft, rfereace at this point is recojnmended to Fig. 3B. on the other hand, the shaft core 223 on the other end of the rotation wheel 22 is provided with an interior dental front 224 which will consummate a mosh in engagement with the exposed dental rim 241 of the compressor 24 so that the compressor 24 will do work to produce high pressure air for storage in the high pressure storage vessel 25 , which will serve to produce a speed differential between the output of the shaft lever 184 185 tFig.l and the output due to shaft sleeve t184 as related to the rotation disk 18 with which to drive the disk 10 to deviation as the vehicle is travelling on.So to speak, in terms of the correlation betweenEngine and Gear shifting under the present invention, the Geax shifting is structured to suit Engine unlike the conventional case where the reverse prevails that which very well accounts for a hard stricken Engine that, as a t ile, eats up a lot of fuel energy when at work, on.e more thing to note is that the power recovery, system according to the present invention will serve in the capacity of a regular brake as well. There is one exception that has to be related herewith, that is, to prevent vanishing of the power as conserved in the high pressure storage vessel 25 owing to the vehicle laying idle for a long period, a DC motor 38 can be used to pump the high pressure air straight into t he high pressure storage vessel 25 for use elsewhile. What follows js an account of the control process prevailing in the enclosed space, illustration on Fig. 2B 31 , 34 , of the pneumatic system as covered in the embodiment according to the second instance of execution. take enclosure 31 for instance, it is divined into right, left hakwes by a diaphragm 311 which is complete with a metal washer 313 in center to permit passing of a Link 312 and fastened in position with screwnuts, on the two enclosure halves there are provided respectively a passage duct 314 315 complete with solenoid valves 316 0 317 capable of controlling absorption or, admission of the gases, referring to Fig. 7A it is seen of the diaphragm 311 lying at center, no deviation whatever produced by the Link 312 , from Fig. 73 it is seen of a situation where diaphragm 5311 starts to displace to the left under force, Micro processor functioning to set solenoid valve 316 to open , whereupon Link 312 will deviate to the left as well in the contrary case, how ver, as illustrated in Fig. 7C. both the diaphragm 811 and the Link 312 will deviate to the right. There is provided for the present invention. an ElectronicsAutomatic Control System which will achieve in aptiuooperation when the present invention is working in the Automation Mode, which comprises a Detector of Engine rpm, a sensor of travelling speeds, a prober of the acceleration by depth, a gear range detector, a gear position detector, information processing centre MicropBocessor solenoid valve and instrumentation panel, all of these serving to control the performance of above mentioned I isk Displacement NoShift Speeder that is the very subject of the present invention, specifically it means exchange switchover of the transmission unit, direct or otherwise, operation of the power recovery clutch to achieve in the final goal of fully automatic no shift speed control the constituting members thereof will further be described as follows 1. Gear Range Detectorr consisting of a gear range board, a detecting lever and a circuit of computation amplifier, as illustrated in Fig. 9 the detecting lever 001 set into contact with the edges of the transmission disk 10 by the rolling wheel 002 on one end, the other end thereof passed across a hydraulic chamber 003 for connection with a Gear Range board, with four sets of 9illumination sources 005 and light sensor 006 , that is, photo sensitive resistors provided on either side of the Gear Range board OO4J, on the Gear Range Board o04 there are provided, in binary sequences suitably spaced perforation holes serving to give push to the detecting lever 00l to bring about deviations when the transmission disk 10 is deviated to arrive in an eccentric rotations, the result is that the Gear Range Board 004 will produce a displacemQnt proportional to the journey achieved through deviation, because of the drag realize by a bumper board 007 as provided on the detecting lever 001 occurring due to the presence of hydraulic fluids in the hydraulic chamber 003 , the detecting lever 001 will not be driven back to the original position when the edge rim of the transmission disk 10 should part from the rolling wheel 002 tenterarily due to an eccentric rotation thereof in despite of the tensile resilience due to spring 008 , a point to note here is that on the bumper board 007 there is provided a hole way 009 by virtue of 8which the bumper board can enjoy a free sliding ovement in the hydraulic chamber, when a ldispalcement takes place on the bumper board 004 , the light source 005 will, by way of the correspondingly located hole on the Gear Range Board, penetrate to shed light on the correspondingly provided light sensor 006 , the resistance of the photo sensitive resistor changed accordingly, to follow that, the resistance prevailing in the computation amplifier 010 as related to the input of the photo sensitive resistor will be changed likewise, the voltage after change will produce a differential by comparison to the voltage as set in the computation amplifier 010 fed in from the other end, to the effect that a signal will be delivered from the computation amplifier to go to the Microprocessor, thus, a particular displacement in the Gear Range Board 004 will be sufficient to compel the computation amplifier circuit to feed a particular signal into the Microprocessor, which, on receiving and acknowledging such a signal, will be kept adviced instantly the deviation and the extent thereof of the transmission dia 10 at any . moment. 2. Detector of acceleration by depths Basic structure akin to the case of the Gear Range Detector above, the Gear RangeBoard being fitted to the Link in connection with the Accelerator, such that it will be stepped upon by the driver to realize deviations concurrent with the driver s z.ctivation of the Accelerator, to the effect that the computation amplifier circuit will feed a discrete signal to the Micro processor thereupon with which a determination can be reached to as regards the depth of the Accelerator in action, still, it would not be necessary to use a device of hydraulic chamber thereon, but a compression spring should be used instead3, so that the Gear Range Board will follow the AcceleratorLink to highly sensitive, synchronized displacement. 3. Travelling speed Detector 50 z To be installed unto the output transmission shaft 5 of the Speeder Box, comprising a Gearing r etececr 3 and an Output Rotation Detector 52 , as illustrated in F gn from which it is clearly seen of a Disk 511 Detector rotating coaxially with the transmission shaft 5 , the periphery of the disk 511 prepared with a number of lined up holes 512 , complete with a photo sensitive switch 54 comprising a light emission device and a receiving device fitted to the annular shell 53 on the outside and to the interior of the outer shell concurrently, the idea is that by the intermittently produced receiving frequencies to come into being when holes t512 pass one by one across the photo sensitive witCh 54 following a rotation of the disk 511 in step with the rotation shaft 5 it will be possible to detect the speedy fast or slow, of the transmission shaft at rotation, that is, the travelling speed of the vehicle provided accordinglyt which speed will be analyzed by the Micro processor to serve as a reference for control of the vehicle at large. 4. Detector of Engine rpm Essentially the same asTravelling speg Detector in structure, installed unto rotative parts related to Engine, to be transmitted by, the Engine in rotation to generate an electronic signal signifying a rotation in progress for output as a piece of information in connection with rotation speed for analysis and processing by the Microprocessor. 5. Gear Position Detector Installed unto the Link that controls the mesh,up Clutch in forward or backward movements, referring to the right lower section of Fig. 2B it is seen of an annular groove 197 as provided on a suitable position on theLink 196 controlling the mesh in Clutch in forward or backward movements, complete with a Fine Switch 198 , structured so that whilst the position of the Link 196 is such that the longitudinally active Clutch 194 is maintained at Neutral position, the ular groove 197 will likewise be in a position to start up activation of Fine Switch 198 in an effort to feed a signal signifying a Neutral Position to theMicro processor. t Instrumentation Panels Complete with a digit display to indicate current travelling speed, Engine rpm, Direction Transmission, Indirect Transmission, Gear Position, Reverse Gearing, and other informations. 7. Information processing centre Microprocessor , Comprising a Circuit Board consisting low cost, easy tmaintenancing large sized ICs, which works basically by virtue of an aptly designed memory formulas softwares so that informations as fed to the Micro processor will be precessed for output as an action directive, excellent in performance, broad in scope of applications, wide adaptability ancl compatibility, software circuits remain unchanged no matter mounted to whatever kind of vehicle, all that has to be done to adjust to a newly remounted vehicle is to change gtho programmes as entered in the Microprocessor to suit specifice control requirements necessitated by a particular vehicle. The operation procedure as covered by the Microprocessor as covered by the present inventioncomprises essentially of eight major steps to be accounted for as follows, reference to Fig. 6 is suggested at this point A Taking the readings of informationsi 1 Travelling speed rravelljng speed per hour of the vehicle taken with Travelling Speed l.ietectort expressed in miles per hour 2 Engine rpm, to be taken with the Engine rpm Detector 3 Accelerator stepping extents to be taken withDetector of Acceleration by depth, as done by the driver 4 Gear Range information Although the invention device is a no shift device, yet to accommodate with the characteristics of the Microprocessor as covered therein, theGear Range information is derived as linearly curved speed curves from the Gear Position rgetector for sectioning into a number ofGear Ranges with which the Microprocessor will identify as to the extent and progression of a speed variation as indicated by the speeder. 5 Gear Position informationa making available the current condition of the Gear, neutral or otherwise 6 Detector of braking actions to identify whether the driver has stepped upon the Accelerator 7 Detector of high pressure aerodynamic storage vessel pressures. B Exchange of informations Converting all informations as entered into the Microprocessor as Gear shifting datas into a unified units readily available for .comparison by analogue methods. C Taking as the basis upon which to effect an evaluation of a Gear Shift such informations as Travelling speed,Engine rpm, Acceleration condition and Gear Ranging 1 checking to see whether Acceleration condition will match Engine rpm under regular loading conditions on a flat surface, the didriver s stress as reflected on a stepping of the aocelirÅator should in some certain way bear some close relevance ofEngine rpm, which, however, will be ruled out in cases where. the vehicle in question is subject to very heavy loading burdens or experiencing a climbing uphill, Engine failing to reach prescribed rpm accordingly, whereupon the MicroprocUsor, based on informations surrendered to that effect, will identify that the situation of an incapacitated Engine instantly, and react to take action to have the Speeder changed to a lower Gear Range in order that theEngine may resume normal rotation rpm, in contrary cases, however, it would mean that the load borne by the Engine is much too light, and an action in response will have to be taken to change to a higher Gear Range accordingly, 2 checking to see whether the Gear Range will match with speed as is well known to all, it is a common practice that a vehicle, travelling on a flat surface en route with cruising speeds, on reaching a specific travelling speed, will have to have the speeder shifted to a suitable Gearing position so that the vehicle navy travel in optimum conditions all the way without trouble, the moment to effect a Gear shifting will be at maturity when and if the travelling speed is out of match with prescribedGear Range. n Execution of a Gear Shiftingss it will turn to be the right time to execute a Gear shifting where and when 1 in cases where the Engine rpm is Al, the C AceelQration condition is 131 if Al is greater than Bi, then a Gear Shifting will have to be taken to a higher Gear range so as to help to increase the amplitude of deviation by the transmission disk however, if Al is smaller than Bl, then a Gear Shifting will have to be taken to a lower Gear Range in an effort to induce a reduction in the amplitude of deviation by the transmission disk 2 in cases where the actual speed changing Gear Range is regarded as A22 and the speed changing Gear Range that should be matched by the travelling speed is regarded as B2 then. the Gear shifting should be to a Lower Gear Range ifA2 is greater than. 132 to a Higher Gear Range if A2 turns amallor than B2. E checking to see if the travelling speed is slower than the speed rate set for a i irect Transmission when it turns that the travelling speed of the vehicle has reached a certain rate, the torsion as produced by the Engine will be available for indirect transmission without reliance on the Speeder device, thus Engine Main Axis may combine with the Output Axis to achieve in a Direct Common transmission instead, thereby voidin4 the power rate losses that would be inevitable in cases of indirect transmission. through the Speeder device, F Turning to direct transmission by or with a combination of the Engine Main Axis with the OutPUt Axis. G Controlling the clutch of the power recovery system to engagement or disengagement by means of a proper processing treatment of informations covering 1. travelling speed, 2. Engine rpm, 3. acceleration condition as acquired from Detector, 4. those forwarded by the Detector of the Accelration petal in case of an acceleration accomplished by the Micro processor, for example When the acceleration petal is released whilst the driver s foot is not yet fully witblrawn from the acceleration petal, the Engine rpm will come down all the same, under such conditions, the Clutch has to be engaged completely to give transmission to the power recovery system, still, the Clutch should not be put to engagement when the driver s foot is removed from the acceleration petal 50 as to let the running vehicle to glide along so as to achieve in the save of fuels, but nonethelos the drivers foot, on touching the braking petal, will be a sufficient cause to bring the clutch to engagement that is, closure H Output control characteristics. The output of theMicroprocessor will be controlled to send the information signals to amplification by transistor crystals, then the solenoid valve will be opened or closed to achieve in automatic gear shifting operations through and through. There are five categories of informations covered in the output control lo Transmission signals for the Direct Transmission Gear 2. Transmission signals for the Indirect Transmission pearl 3. Signals to change a lower speed Gear to a Higher speed Gear 4. Signals to change a Higher speed Gear to a lower one 5. Activation Signals to set the Clutch of the power resovers Device to angaoement or disennanement statue. From the descriptions going thus far it is understandably clear that the Speeder device by structure functions to control aClutch to give transmissions to compression mechanism so as to produce pneumattc power by utilization of the vacuum absorptive suction produced while vehicle Engine is set to rotation, what with the manipulation and performance of a Microprocessor therefor a transmission termed as Disk Displacement No shift speeder operation is made a possibility such that a travelling vehicle will be available to set the speed Gearing in strict conformity to theAcceleration operation so that tQeXngine rpm will discharge its role in full in the form of utilizable power without wasting a bit of the precious utilizable energy source, which, in the meantime, will provide a convenience unexpected of for the drivers in conducting their vehicles, it is therefore contended that the present invention is a truly economically and professionally worth while piece of invention. It has to be pointed out in particular that an embodiment of the invention has been executed as an incorporated section to a conventional vehicle, and fasnd as ideal and wonderful as the descriptions made in the foregoing as a real gospel to the drivers. It should appear apparent that what has been given thus far in the disclosure will serve but as one or two examples of the present invention in execution, all modifications, revisions, applications of the invention that does or do not deviate from the contents contended for the invention should doubtless be regarded as falling naturally into the coverage to be protected for the present invention for the period specified in the country to which the present is submitted in the hope of securing a PatentGrant.
