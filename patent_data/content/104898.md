# Gearbox indicator switch.

## Abstract
In order to provide a reliable position indicator for a gear control, particularly for automatic transmission motor vehi cles, use is made of reed switches 2 . These may be mounted in a sealed housing and operable by a magnet 1 from outside the housing. The magnet 1 is movable by and with the gear control. The reed switches 2 may be mounted on a printed circuit board 3 and flux concentrators 4 are preferably provided between adjacent reed switches 2 to shield them until the magnet 1 is closely adjacent.
