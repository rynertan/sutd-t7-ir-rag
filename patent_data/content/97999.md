# Signal processing system comprising a signal source, a signal processing unit and connecting cables.

## Abstract
A signal processing system comprising a signal source CAM , a signal processing unit CPU and connecting cables CC1 CC5 having different lengths and being connectable therebetween. In the unit CPU an amplifier series arrange ment ATT, AMP2, AMP1 comprising a switchable signal attenuator ATT , a low noise, non controlled signal ampli fier AMP2 and a AGC signal amplifier AMP1 is present to compensate for the variable cable losses. A change over input ST of the signal attenuator ATT is coupled to a change over circuit ATS which has a locking inpit LT and a measuring signal input DT . The measuring signal input TD is coupled directly to a signal detection circuit DET , a further output of which is coupled to the locking input LT , via a time signal generator TSG . After a time delay of several dozens of seconds, locking is effected, whereafter the signal attenuator ATT can no longer switch over during the normal signal processing operation and impermissible sud den signal amplitude changes are prevented from occurring.
