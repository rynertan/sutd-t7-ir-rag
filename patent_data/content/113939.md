# A cleansing unit.

## Abstract
A cleansing unit 1 for collecting swept up dirt comprises at least one upwardly extending face 3 with a slot 4 at the bot tom thereof. Suction means 5 e.g. a centrifugal fan are pro vided within the casing and have a suction inlet 6 disposed ad jacent the slot 4. Dirt swept to the unit may be drawn through the slot 4 by the suction means 5 and collected in a bag 7.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A cleansing unit comprising at least one upwardly extending face with an aperture at or adjacent the bottom thereof, and suction means disposed within the casing, said suction means having a suction inlet disposed proximate said opening and being associated with dirt collection means to which dirt is delivered by the suction means. 2. A cleansing unit as claimed in claim 1 wherein the suction means is a material handling fan. 3. A cleansing unit as claimed in claim 2 wherein the material handling fan is a centrifugal fan. 4. A cleansing unit as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the suction inlet is of fish tail configuration. 5. A cleansing unit as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the dirt collection means is a bag. 6. A cleansing unit substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

## Description
The present invention relates to 2 cleansing unit. Kitchen floors are frequently cleaned by means of a soft bristle brush which is in many instances more suitable than a mobile vacuum cleaner since the latter may not be able to remove dirt, e.g. crumbs, fluff, etc. from corners, this being a simple operation with the soft bristles of the brush. However, the swept up dirt has normally either to be collected with a dust pan or like utensil, which can be a tiresome operation, or swept outside. It is an object of the present invention to provide a cleansing unit which allows swept up dirt to be removed quickly and easily. According to the present invention there is provided a cleansing unit comprising at least one upwardly extending face with a lowermost aperture, and suction means disposed within the casing, said suction means having a suction inlet disposed proximate said opening and being associated with dirt collection means to which dirt is delivered by the suction means. The cleansing unit of the invention may be positioned, preferably fixed in position, on the floor of a kitchen or other room or area to be swept.Dirt or the like may be swept along the floor towards the opening in the cabinet and, when sufficiently close thereto, can be sucked into the unit upon activation of the suction means and collected in the dirt collection means. Suitable controls, e.g. a switch, may be provided on or in the vicinity of the unit for operating the suction means when desired to collect the swent up dirt. The need to remove the dirt from the floor by means of a dustpan or the like is thus avoided. The casing of the unit may be formed of any suitable material, for example wood or plywood. For installation in a fitted kitchen the casing may be of the same colour and appearance as other units e.g. cupboards in the kitchen so as to blend with surrounding fitments and be unobtrusive. The suction means is for preferance a material handling fan, most preferably a centrifugal fan.The suction inlet may be a nozzle, e.g. of fish tail configuration, which is provided at or in the vicinity of the opening in the casing. Dirt collection means may be provided by a bag, preferably a cloth bag, to which dirt is passed from the suction means. The invention will be further described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawing showing an exploded perspective view of one embodiment of cleansing unit in accordance with the invention. The illustrated cleansing unit includes a box like casing 1 sitting on the floor 2 of a room and having front face 3, shown removed in the drawings for the purpose clarity. An elongate slot 4 is provided at the bottom of face 3. Within the casing 1 is mounted a centrifugal fan 5 associated with a fish tail configuration suction nozzle 6, the inlet of which locates at the slot 4 when the face 3 is in position. A cloth dirt collection bag 7 communicates with the centrifugal fan 5 via a tube 8 on the end of which the bag 7 is removably mounted. An access opening not shown is provided in the casing so that access may be gained for removing the bag 7 from tube 8 for emptying purposes. Suitable controls, not shown, are provided for operating the fan 4. In use of the unit 1, dirt is swept from the floor 2 of the room towards the slot 4. The fan 5 may then be operated to suck the dirt through the nozzle 6 such that it is collected in bag 7. Once the bag 7 is full it may be emptied as indicated above and subsequently replaced. It will thus be appreciated that the invention provides a simple and effective solution for removing swept up dirt from the floor of a room.
