# Process for cell disruption.

## Abstract
Process for disrupting cells by contacting an aqueous, cell containing medium with a protease enzyme, wherein the enzymic contact is preceded by contact with an ionic surfact ant the polysaccharide solutions thereby produced and a process for displacing a fluid through a well and or a perme able subsurface formation communicating with the well, by in jecting into the well an optionally diluted, aqueous solution of such a polysaccharide.
