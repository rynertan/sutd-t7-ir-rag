# SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING POSTURE OF TOOL.

## Abstract
In the system for controlling the posture of a tool, a tool vector W‚ÇÅ which represents the actual position of the tool is turned to an object tool vector W , and the driving data on each axis of a robot are prepared on the basis of the data obtained by the turning of the vector. Therefore, in, for example, a welding robot, the angle, of inclination of a torch with respect to an arc starting surface can be set to an optimum level automatically, so that an arc starting point can be found accurately. This enables a desired arc starting point to be found reliably without assistance.
