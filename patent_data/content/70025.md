# TRAILING ARM SUSPENSION FOR AN AUTOMOTIVE VEHICLE

## Abstract
A trailing arm suspension which comprises a suspen sion arm 1 suspended to a suspension member 4 through resiliently deformable members 2 . The resilient members 2 are arranged so that at least one of the members has its longitudinal axis tilted with respect to a pivot axis 6 of the suspension arm 1 for vertical displacement thereabout. The tilting angle of the member is selected to make sure that a high rigidity axis 7 of the resilient member which extends normally to the longitudinal axis thereto crosses the high rigidity axis 7 of the other resilient member at a point Q behind the pivot axis 6 . The crossing point Q of the high rigidity axis 7, 7 is located behind the pivot axis 6 of the suspension arm 1 and behind and outside of the traction point T of a road wheel 5 so that toe in change may be caused in the wheel alignment in response to a lateral force applied thereto.
