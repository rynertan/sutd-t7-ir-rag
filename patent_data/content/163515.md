# ANIMAL SEPARATOR

## Abstract
A poultry separator 8 Figure 1b includes a perch 31, a load cell 32 and pen divider 21 providing a barrier between a collection region 14 for birds in a certain weight range and a collection region 15 for birds outside that range. When a bird alighting on the perch in region 14 is shown by the load cell to be in the wrong pen, a signal from the load cell operates a drive unit 34 to move the perch into region 15 where the bird is expelled from the perch prior to the return of the perch to region 14 . Separators for separating animals other than birds are also discussed.
