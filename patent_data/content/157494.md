# PRODUCTION OF DIELECTRIC INSULATION LAYERS UPON ELECTRICAL CONDUCTORS

## Abstract
Providing an electrical conductor 10 with an insulation layer having a layer of dielectric carrier with magnetically per meable particles dispersed within the carrier, in which homo geneity is maintained in a fluid mixture 18 of a fluid carrier and the particles, the conductor is moved vertically through a die means 16 to coat it with a fluid layer of the mixture, the fluid carrier is dried and thickness of the dried insulation layer is con trolled. This control is achieved by monitoring the thickness or diameter of the dried layer and, if a variation exists between the monitored and required values, the rate of fluid flow through the die means is adjusted to adjust the monitored values to wards that required.
