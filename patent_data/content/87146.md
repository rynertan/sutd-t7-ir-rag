## Abstract
A braking device for use in a spring motor type roller blind comprising cam and brake means interposed between a rotatable tube 3 and a fixed shah 9 in substitution for a centrifugal clutch. The means has a brake drum 11 mounted on the fixed shaft 9 , a coil spring brake 13 mounted on the brake drum, a cam sleeve 16 mounted on the brake drum and formed with a Y shaped cam groove 20 , the coil spring brake 13 having one end 13a fixed to the cam sleeve 15 and the other end 13b disposed under the bottom part of the Y shaped cam groove 20 , and a cam casing 16 integrally mounted in the tube 3 and provided with a cam pin 21 for engagement with the cam groove 20 . The cam pin 21 relatively moves along the cam groove 20 and pushes either of the opposite ends 13a, 13b to loosen the coil spring brake 13 when the screen 2 is drawn and when it is released after drawn from a position except the uppermost position and fasten the same on the brake drum when it is released after drawn from the uppermost position.
