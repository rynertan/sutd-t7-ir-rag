# Applying thermoplastic sleeve to crush resistant tubing.

## Abstract
In a submarine cable optical fibre regenerator housing a copper tail pipe optionally with a brass end section incorpor ating an anti extrusion profile for fitting inside a gland is provided with a tight fitting length of thermoplastics sleeving by collapsing a thermoplastics preform down onto the tail pipe using heat and air pressure applied to the outside of an elastomeric tube into which the tail pipe and preform have been inserted.
