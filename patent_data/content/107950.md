# Industrial suction apparatus.

## Abstract
Industrial suction apparatus, particularly for use in reclaiming spilled drilling mud, comprises a vacuum tank exhausted by two heavy duty vacuum pumps driven by a compressed air motor. A sweeping head communicates with the tank interior by way of a conduit including a downwardly extending portion within the tank and terminating at an intended maximum working level of mud in the tank. A discharge pump is disposed exteriorly of the tank and consists of a compressed air operated diaphragm pump operable simultaneously with the exhausters. Discharge activity of the discharge pump is automatic due to the choice of discharge pump type.
