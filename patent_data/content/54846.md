# Diamond and cubic boron nitride abrasive compacts using size selective abrasive particle layers and process for making same.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an improved process for preparing a composite compact wherein a mass of abrasive crystals, a mass of metal carbide, and a bonding medium are sub jected to a high temperature high pressure process for providing a composite compact. The sintered carbide mass supports the mass of abrasive crystals and bonding or catalyst metal, and the abrasive crystal grains are directly bonded to adjacent crystal grains in the mass thereof. Such improved process comprises disposing the mass of abrasive crystals in layers wherein the coarsest layer is closest to the carbide mass and is composed of crystals having a largest dimension of between about 75 and 500 µm and the finest layer is disposed farthest away in the carbide mass and is com posed of crystals having a largest dimension of less than 10 µm. The abrasive crystals are selected from the group consisting of diamond and cubic boron nitride and preferably are diamond the metal carbide prefer ably is tungsten carbide and the bonding metal prefer ably is cobalt. The resulting improved composite compact also is disclosed.
