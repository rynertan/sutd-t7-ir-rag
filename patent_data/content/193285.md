# Improvements in self energising disc brakes.

## Abstract
A self energising disc brake is disclosed. The brake is applied by moving a pair of pressure plates 6, 7 angularly to cause them to separate and clamp friction discs 3, 4 between themselves and braking faces 8, 9 at opposite ends of a housing 1 . The angular movement of the plates 6 and 7 is initiated by a brake applying mechanism compris ing a pair of links 21, 22 of different lengths, which are pivotally connected at their outer ends to respective lugs 16, 15 on the pressure plates 6, 7 , and a pull rod which is connected to the inner ends of the links through a common pivot 25 and is radially displaceable. This facilitates installa tions of the brake within asymmetrically arranged housings.
