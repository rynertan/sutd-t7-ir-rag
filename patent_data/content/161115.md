# Improved anchor grip for tensioned elements in concrete structures.

## Abstract
A plug P is present in the bore B of a wedge gripping device W in a barrel 1 of a grip. The device W is formed of tapering segments 4 which are held apart by the plug P . When a length of wire or strand element E is received in the device W , the plug P is displaced out of the bore B so causing the device W to grip the element E .
