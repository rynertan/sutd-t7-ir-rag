The various ester groups which R3 represents can be incor prorated in the 3,4 dihydro 3 oxoquinoxalines in one of two ways. First, the initial reactant, the mesoxalate, can be esterified with C1 C4 alkyl groups to Formula I wherein R3 is C1 C4 alkyl or other groups represented by R . Thus, in the final product, whether it be formula II or III, the ester group would be the same as that present in the starting material.Secondly, the alkyl ester of Formula II or III can be hydrolyzed to yield the free acid those compounds of Formula I in which R3 is H and this free acid can in turn be reesterified with a C3 C6 cycloalkyl group, a C3 C4 alkenyl group or a C1 C4 alkyl group.

In vitro antiviral activity was determined as follows African green monkey kidney cells BSC 1 orHela cells 5 3 were grown in 25 cc. Falcon flasks at 370C. in medium 199 with 5 percent inactivated fetal bovine serum FBS , penicillin 150 units 1 ml. and streptomycin 150 mcg. ml. . When confluent monolayers were formed, the supernata growth medium was removed and 0.3 ml. of an appropriate dilution of Maryland B orAnn Arbor influenza virus was added to each flask.After adsorption for one hour at room temperature, the virus infected cell sheet was overlaid with a medium comprising one part 1 percent lonagar No. 2 and one part double strength medium 199 with FCS fetal calf serum , penicillin, and streptomycin and also containing drug at concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 12, 6 and 3 micrograms per milliliter mcg. ml. .

The flasks were incubated for 72 hours at 37 CC. Plaques were seen in those areas where the virus infected and reproduced in the cells. A solution of 10 percent formalin and 2 percent sodium acetate was added to each flask to inactivate the virus and fix the cell sheet to the surface of the flask. The virus plaques, irrespective of size, were counted after staining the surrounding cell areas with crystal violet. The plaque count was compared to the control count at each drug concenoration.

For in vitro use, the compounds can be formulated by dissolving them in a lower alkanol, for example ethanol or methanol, or at low concentration as an emulsion in water with the use of a surface active agent. If R3 in formula I is H, an alkali metal salt of the acid can be used in aqueous solution. The antiviral composition containing a quinoxaline according to formula I as the active ingredient is, therefore, applied to the virus habitat in vitro, such habitats including walls of hospital rooms, laboratory benches, laboratory glassware, and the like. The compounds can lso be added to tissue culture to suppress viral growth therein. For in vivo use, the compounds can be administered either parenterally or orally. For arenteral administration, as by the intraperitoneal oute employed in the above experimental work, the impound may be dissolved in water containing 2 of a surface active agent, particularly an emulphor a zolyhydroxylated fatty acid . Oral administration is, cf course, preferred.For such use, a quinoxaline according to formula I above is mixed with one or more standard pharmaceutically acceptable extending media such as starch, sucrose, lactose, calcium carbonate tc. and the mixture loaded into empty telescoping gelatin capsules, such that each capsule contains an amount of a quinoxaline effective to suppress the growth of influenza virus, either prospective or present. In other words, the compounds can be used prophylactically or as curative agents. Alternatively, the drug can be mixed with various excipients including starch, lubricating agents, wetting agents, etc., such as stearic acid, magnesium sterate and the like, and the mixture pressed into tablets, each tablet containing an amount of the drug effective to abort or cure an attack of influenza.Such tablets can be scored so as to provide half or quarter dosages where the drug is to be admsnistered to children. The compounds can also be administered in solution or suspension. Compounds represented by one or more of formulae I, II, III and X above are administered to mammals susceptible to infection with influenza virus including horses, mice, pigs and humans. Among humans, the compounds are administered prophylactically particularly to the elderly, young children, nurses, doctors, and other hospital or public health personnel, when there is evidence of an imminent flu epidemic.The compounds can also be given to anyone having a known exposure to a person with flu . It is a particular advantage of the therapeutic processes of this invention that the compounds may be administered either prophylactically or therapeutically to patients without a preliminary determination that the virus is influenza virus A strain or B strain, since the compounds are effective against both strains.
