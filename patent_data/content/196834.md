# SECURITY ARRANGEMENT FOR CORDLESS TELEPHONE SYSTEM

## Abstract
A security system for cordless telephones prevents unauthorized telephone calls over telephone lines. The system includes a base unit 10 and a cordless handset unit 50 which must share common information for proper operation. To prevent an unauthorized user in possession of a handset unit from easily matching a security code stored in the base unit and thereby obtain dial tone thereform, the security code in the base unit is transferred to the handset unit while the handset unit is in a mating cradle in the base unit. Transfer circuits 12, 13, 14 in the base unit and the handset unit 51, 53 respectively transmit and receive the security code and also an operating frequency channel over a direct current charging path provided for charging of a battery in the handset unit whenever the handset unit is returned to the cradle.
