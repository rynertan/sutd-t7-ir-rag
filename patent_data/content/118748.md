## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Epoxides have gained wide acceptance in protective coatings in electrical and structural applications due to their exceptional combination of properties such as toughness, adhesion, chemical resistance, and superior electrical properties. Epoxides may be cured by ultraviolet light UV or thermally. W cure involves the use of a photoinitiator with the epoxide. When this system is radiated with ultraviolet light, the formulation is cured into a coating. However, many of the epoxides used in these systems have a relatively high viscosity. To reduce this viscosity, the systems may be warmed which results in a decrease in viscosity. Polyols are often combined with epoxides to improve their properties. When the polyols are of sufficient molecular weight, for example, to improve flexibility of the epoxide coatings, they further increase the viscosity of the formulation. If they are of low molecular weight such as diethylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, etc. , they may decrease the viscosity of the formulation, but they do not enhance the flexibility and or toughness of the system and may make it more brittle. In addition, usually only small amounts of such low molecular weight compounds including alcohols can be employed or properties of the resultant coating will be deleteriously affected. The low molecular weight alcohols exhibit the most detrimental effect on crosslink density and the coating solvent resistance and hardness.The affinity of any given compound for the other components will also have an effect on the viscosity reducing power of any given diluent. As the molecular weight is decreased, there often is a concommitant increase in volatility which can result in loss of a given compound during the radiation cure step or in a subsequent thermal curing operation. Moderate levels of mono glycidyl compounds such as butyl glycidyl ether, etc., are often used as epoxy diluents but in W curing systems they retard the curing process. Solvents, in general, could be used to reduce viscosity but they would need to be volatilized at some point in the coating process. However, such volatilization would negate the benefits of radiation curable systems which are considered to be essentially 100 percent solids coating systems. What is needed for radiation cure systems is a rapidly curable reactive diluent that will cure into the final product, have a marked effect in lowering viscosity, be of low volatility during the radiation cure operation, and not retard the curing rate. THE INVENTION It has now been found that when a substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide is added to a composition containing an epoxide which has two or more epoxy groups, the substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide has a marked effect in lowering the viscosity of the composition. Also, the substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide is not volatilized during the radiation cure operation. Further, the use of the substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide in the composition containing the epoxide allows a formulator a great deal of latitude in devising systems that can be applied by roll coating, spray, and other methods of application. Its use also allows an end user to apply such films in a very thin form which can result in significant cost savings.Moreover, the substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide is capable of coreacting with the epoxide in the composition to provide coatings having an excellent combination of properties. The composition of this invention suitable for photocopolymerizable comprises a an epoxide containing two or more epoxy groups, and b a substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide. The composition may optionally contain a photoinitiator that generates a species capable of polymerizing epoxides when subjected to a radiation source. The substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide of this invention is substituted with alkyl of 1 to 9 carbon atoms, halogen, oxygen, ether, ester or vinyl radicals. Preferably, the substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide is vinyl substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide and is preferably selected from one or more of the following 1 4 vinyl cyclohexane monoepoxide having the formula EMI3.1 2 norbornene monoepoxide having the formula EMI4.1 3 limonene monoepoxide having the formula EMI4.2 The substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide is used in the composition in amounts of from about 0.1 to about 95, preferably from about 1 to about 60, and most preferably, from about 3 to about 30 weight percent.

Monoepoxide vinyl cyclohexene monoepoxide. Surfactant A silicone surfactant with the structureEMI16.1 Photoinitiator 1 UVE 1014, a solution of a triarylsulfonium hexafluoroantimony salt with a specific gravity of 1.39 and a Brookfield viscosity of 74 centipoise obtained from General Electric Cho. . Photoinitiator 2 FC 508, a solution of a triarylsulfonium hexafluorophosphate with a specific gravity of 1.33 and a Brookfield viscosity of 40,000 to 60,000 centipoise obtained from Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company . The procedures used to test coatings cured with the compositions of this invention were as follows Solvent Resistance Double Acetone Rubs a measure of the resistance of the cured film to attack by acetone in which a film coating surface was rubbed with an acetone soaked cheesecloth back and forth with hand pressure. A rub back and forth with hand pressure over the film coating surface with the acetone soaked cheesecloth was designated as one double acetone rub . The effect that a certain number of double acetone rubs had on the film coating surface was reported by a number in parenthesis following the number of double acetone rubs. The rating system for evaluating acetone resistance for a given number of double acetone rubs was as follows Number in Parenthesis After Number of Rubs 1 No change in coating appearance. 2 Scratched surface. 3 Dulled, marred, some coating removed. 4 Breaks in coating appearance. 5 About one half of the coating removed.Pencil Hardness ASTMD 3363 74 The rating system for pencil hardness was as follows 6B 5B 4B 3B 2B B HB F H 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H Softer HarderCrosshatch adhesion refers to a test using 10 parallel, single edge, razor blades to scribe test films with 2 sets of perpendicular lines in a crosshatch pattern. Ratings are based on the amount of film removed after applying and subsequently pulling a contact adhesive tape Scotch Brand 606 away from the surface of a scribed coating at a 90 degree angle in a fast, rapid movement. It is important to carefully apply and press the tape to the scribed coating to eliminate air bubbles and provide a good bond because adhesion is reported as the percent of film remaining on the substrate with a 100 percent rating indicating complete adhesion of the film in the substrate.Reverse or face impact resistance measures the ability of a given film to resist rupture from a falling weight. A Gardner Impact Tester using an eight pound dart is used to test the films cast and cured on the steel panel. The dart is raised to a given height in inches and dropped onto the reverse or face side of a coated metal panel. The inches times pounds, designated inch pounds, absorbed by the film without rupturing is recorded as the reverse or face impact resistance of the film. Example 1 This example describes the blending ofMonoepoxide with Epoxy 1 in various ratios. It demonstrates the powerful viscosity reducing eftect the vinyl cycloaliphatic monoepoxide has on this diepoxide. The two compounds were mixed at room temperature about 25 C . The viscosity of the mixture was determined at 260C with a Brookfield viscometer. The results are shown in Table I.

Example 2 This example describes the combination ofEpoxy 1 with Monoepoxide and 4 of two different photoinitiators. Various amounts, as shown in Tables II andIV, of Epoxy 1, Monoepoxide, and eitherPhotoinitiator 1 Table II or Photoinitiator 2 Table IV were placed in amber bottles while working under a yellow light source. The systems were coated onto Bonderite 37 steel panels with a No. 20 wire wound rod and cured with one pass unless otherwise noted under a 100 watt per inch medium pressure energy vapor UV light source at 30 feet per minute fpm . The systems were aged at room temperature about 250 without a post cure and with a ten minute post cure at 1700C.The thickness of the cured coating varied from 0.65 mil to 1.0 mil. This example demonstrates that combinations of the epoxides can be cured with ultraviolet light when photoinitiators of the onium salt type are used. TABLE II System.

Systems 1, 2, and 4 were tack free when warm immediately after W exposure.Systems 3 and 5 had a slight tack when warm immediately after W exposure but were tack free when cooled to room temperature about 25 C . Cured coating thickness varied from 0.8 to 0.9 mil. The properties of the cured coatings is given in Table IX.
