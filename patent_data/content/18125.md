# Camera apparatus for use with an endoscope.

## Abstract
A camera apparatus 1, 51 which enables a picture to be taken of the interior of a coeliac cavity by being mounted on an endoscope 2 . A detecting means 4, 54 detects whether the apparatus is or is not mounted on the endoscope 2 . When the camera apparatus is so mounted, the detecting means 4, 54 is effective to feed power to an electrical circuit of the apparatus, which is required to be in an energized state during a photographing operation, from an internal battery or an external power supply, thus keeping low the power dissipation of the internal battery.
