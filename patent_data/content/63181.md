# Composite buckling blind fastener.

## Abstract
This invention relates to blind fasteners and more particularly to blind fasteners having a large bearing surface on the blind side of the structure on which it is mounted. Prior art fasteners either tend to damage the material on which they are mounted, have too small of a blind side bearing surface, or are too long to be used in certain applications. The fastener of the present invention has a nut 21 with an axial bore 23 therethrough, a conically shaped nose 24 at one end and an enlarged head 26 at the other end. Extending through said nut is a bolt 30 having a stem 31 and an enlarged head 32 adjacent to said nut nose 24 . Between said nut nose and said bolt head is a sleeve 40 on said bolt stem. The improvement of the present invention comprises said sleeve having a thick wall 41 section adjacent to said bolt head and a thin wall section 42 adjacent to said nut nose and a collar 50 which engages said sleeve and which has a tensile strength very much less than the tensile strength of said sleeve.
