# FLUORINE SUBSTITUTED PHENYL BENZOATES AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PREP ARATION.

## Abstract
Fluorine substituted phenyl benzoates represented by general formula Ar CO₂ Ar , wherein one of Ar and Ar represents a p or o fluorophenyl group, and the other rep resents a m fluorophenyl group are prepared by subjecting a fluorobenzoic acid represented by general formula Ar CO₂H, wherein Ar represents a fluorophenyl group to oxidative decarboxylation reaction. They are useful as inter mediates of fluorophenols.
