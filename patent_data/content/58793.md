# SCRAP CUTTER FOR USE WITH MECHANICAL PRESS

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a scrap cutter for chopping up the skeleton of strip stock material as it is fed out of a mechanical press 12 . The scrap cutter 10 is designed to be a free standing unit positioned at the outfeed side of the press and actuated by a hydraulic cylinder 30 that is connected through a flexible hose 40 to a second hydraulic cylinder 38 actuated by a power takeoff from the press, such as a cam 56 or small pitman connected to the crankshaft extension 54 of the press. The flexible hydraulic connection between the press and scrap cutter enables the position of the scrap cutter relative to the press to be easily adjusted and eliminates the large and unwieldy mechanical interconnections between the press crankshaft and scrap cutter blade actuating mechanism. A pressure relief valve 178 connected in the hydraulic circuit provides overload protection by relieving the hydraulic pressure when it exceeds a predetermined level, as would occur if multiple thicknesses of stock become jammed between the blades, 24 , 26 or other overload producing conditions occur.
