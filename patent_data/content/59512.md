# Improvements in and relating to testing coins.

## Abstract
A coin testing apparatus comprises transmitting and receiving coils 14 and 15 on opposite sides of a coin passageway 11 . The transmitting coil is connected to high and low frequency oscillators 16 and 17 . The output of the receiving coil is separated into the high and low frequency components by a high pass filter 21 and a band pass filter 22 . In the high frequency channel the signal is amplitude controlled by a voltage controlled amplifier 23 rectified by a rectifier 24 and smoothed by a long time constant circuit 26 . The initial rise in level caused by a coin entering between the coils 14 and 15 is detected by an instantaneous level change comparator 32 which responds to the rate of change of signal level at the output of the long time constant circuit 26 becoming equal to preset threshold and causes a normally closed switch 27 to be opened. When the switch 27 is closed a comparator 31 compares the signal with a reference value from a source 30 and adjusts the gain of the amplifier 23 until the signal corresponds to the reference value. Upon the arrival of the coin the switch 27 is opened and a long time constant circuit 28 causes the gain of the amplifier 23 to be maintained at the level before the arrival of the coin. A window comparator 33 compares the difference in voltage with voltage ranges for acceptable coins. A similar arrangement is provided in the low frequency channel but with two differences. The switch 27 in the low frequency channel is operated by the same instantaneous level comparator as is used for the high frequency channel and instead of a rectifier 24 a novel sample and hold technique is used for providing a d.c. signal from the output of the amplifier 23 .
