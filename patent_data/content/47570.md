# Controlled short residence time coal liquefaction process.

## Abstract
Normally solid dissolved coal product and a distil late liquid product are produced by continuously pass ing a feed slurry comprising raw feed coal and a recycle solvent oil and or slurry together with hydrogen to a preheating reaction zone 26, alone, or 26 together with 42 , the hydrogen pressure in the preheating reaction zone being at least 1500 psig 105 kg cm² , reacting the slurry in the preheating reaction zone 26, or 26 with 42 at a temperature in the range of between about 455 and about 500 C to dissolve the coal to form normally liquid coal and normally solid dissolved coal. A total slurry residence time is maintained in the reaction zone ranging from a finite value from about 0 to about 0.2 hour, and reaction effluent is continuously and directly contacted with a quenching fluid 40, 68 to substantially immediately reduce the temperature of the reaction effluent to below 425 C to substantially inhibit polymerization so that the yield o insoluble organic matter comprises less than 9 weight percent of said feed coal on a moisture free basis. The reaction is performed under conditions of temperature, hydrogen pressure and residence time such that the quantity of distillate liquid boiling within the range C₅ 454 C is an amount at least equal to that obtainable by performing the process under the same conditions ex cept for a longer total slurry residence time, e.g., 0.3 hour. Solvent boiling range liquid is separated from the reaction effluent and recycled as process solvent. The amount of solvent boiling range liquid is suffcient to provide at least 80 weight percent of that required to maintain the process in overall solvent balance. The present process involves the remarkable discovery that a greater liquid yield can be produced at a short resi dence time under controlled conditions, than at a longer residence time under otherwise similar conditions, even while the primary product fraction is normally solid dissolved coal and the production of net liquid product is not encouraged.
