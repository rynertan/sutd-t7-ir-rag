# SIGNAL PROCESSING METHOD IN AUTORADIOGRAPHY

## Abstract
A signal processing method in autoradiography for obtaining information on one dimensional location of radioactively labeled substances distributed in at least one dimensional direction on a support medium in the form of symbol, numeral or combination thereof, which comprises a process including 1 preparing a graph in which position on a scanning line is set on abscissa and signal level is set on ordinate and 2 processing said graph with either or both of smoo thing and threshold processing to detect sampling points said process being applied to digital signal correspond ing to an autoradiagraph having the locational information on the radioactively labeled substances, said digital signal being obtained by utilizing a radiation image recording and reproducing method employing a stimulable phosphor sheet. A signal processing method for determining the base sequence of DNA is also disclosed.
