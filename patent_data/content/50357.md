# Liquid crystal display element and process for production thereof.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a liquid crystal display element comprising a pair of transparent substrates 1a, 1b , electrodes formed on the individual surfaces there of facing each other, a liquid crystal material layer held between the substrates 1a, 1b , and gap controlling material 2, 3 for keeping the gab 1g between the substrates 1a, 1b , whereby the gap controlling material is dispersed and fixed on the substrate surface by an insulating coating film 4 such as an orientation con trolling film, When the gap controlling material 2, 3 is thus dispersed and fixed, there can be obtained a liquid crystal display element in which the distance 1g be tween the substrates is uniform. Preferably the gap controlling material is a combination of a polymer solid 3 and an insulating material 2 having a higher soften ing point and rigidity than those of the polymer solid 3 , and the insulating coating film 4 is an orientation controlling film.
