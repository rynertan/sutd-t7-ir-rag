# MICROWAVE ENERGY MODERATING BAG

## Abstract
An improved microwave energy moderating bag for enclosing, for instance, foodstuff such as a beef roast to be cooked at relatively high power in a microwave oven so that the foodstuff can be uniformly cooked to a predetermined degree of doneness without being repositioned and without having to vary the power level during the cooking interval. The improved bag is of the type fabricated from a laminated sheet comprising two laminae of thermoplastic films and a perforated foil lamina of microwave reflective material such as, for example, aluminum foil. The improved bag comprises an improved pouch type closure and duplex side seams. Both static and dynamic embodiments of the invention are disclosed a static embodiment being dimensionally stable as opposed to a dynamic embodiment which is heat shrinkable by virtue of comprising a heat shrinkable thermoplastic film. Such a dynamic embodiment is so constructed that it transitions from being substantially transparent to microwave energy to being substantially less transparent to microwave energy as its temperature is increased for instance, during a cooking cycle in a microwave oven.
