## Description
This invention relates to a N 6 substituted pyridine 2carbonyl 3 substituted histidine derivate of the formulaEMI1.1 and its salts and to a method of preparing the same. These compounds have anti tumor activity. Various studies on the synthesis of analogues with a pyrimidine moiety which is the active site of Bleomycin which is used as an anti tumor agent have been made, and, as a result, a new N 6 substituted pyridine 2 carbonyl 3 substituted histidine derivative of the formula I hereunder referred to as PYML 4 has been found which forms a complex with metal ions such as Fe II ions and has a remarkably high oxygen activating ability. The new compound is, therefore, expected to be of use as an antitumor agent. The compound of the formula I of the present invention can be prepared by eliminating the protecting groups by a conventional method from a compound of the general formula EMI2.1 wherein each Y represents a protecting group. Any protecting groups used for the protection of an amino group can be used as the protecting groups in the compound of the formula II a benzyloxycar.bonyl or t butyloxycarbonyl, particularly o nitrophenylsulfenyl group hereunder referred to as nips is preferred. The elimination of the protecting group can be accomplished by catalytic reduction, hydrolysis, or acid decomposition, depending on the protecting group. When the protecting group is the Nps group, it can be eliminated by hydrolysis at OOC to 600C, generally at room temperature, with an organic acid such as citric acid, a halogeno acid such as hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid, or an inorganic acid such as sulfuric acid.

Examples of possible reactive derivatives include active esters and acid anhydrides. The reaction can be carried out in an inert organic solvent at a temperature between 100C and the boiling point of the solvent used a temperature in the range of OOC to 40 C is usually preferred. The isolation and purification of the reaction product may be performed by chromatography. The compound BHBE of the formula III can be obtained by first protecting the amino groups of erythro 3 hydroxy L hystidine hereunder referred to as HyRis of the formula V EMI4.1 and then reacting it with isobutene in an inert organic solvent under an inert atmosphere in the presence of an acid catalyst in a sealed tube. The compound of the general formula IV can be prepared in the following manner Methyl 6 formylpyridine 2 carboxylate hereunder reerred to as HPy CME is reacted with s 3 amino 2 tert butoxycarbonyl amino propionic acid amide hereunder referred to as Boc DAPA .
