European Patent Specification No. 0001628 discloses a group of synthetic antibacterial agents containing a 7 oxo 1 azabicyclo 3.2.0 hept 2 ene ring system, i.e. carbapenem derivatives. However all compounds described in that specification were racemic at C S and could only be prepared by a lengthy synthetic sequence. We have now discovered a process for preparing carbapenem derivatives from natural products in relatively few steps and produces carbapenem derivatives as a desirable single optical isomer at C 5. The present invention provides a process for the preparation of compounds of the formula I EMI2.1 and salts and esters thereof, wherein R1 and R2 each represent a hydrogen atom or an organic group bonded via a carbon atom to the carbapenem ring, and R3 is a group NR4R5 wherein R4 is an optionally substituted C1 6 alkyl group or an optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl group or optionally substituted aryl C16 S alkyl or heteroaryl C1,6 alkyl group and R is a hydrogen atom or an optionally substituted C1 6 alkyl group, or R3 is an optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl group or an optionally substituted C1,6 alkyl group which process comprises the reaction of a compound of the formula II or a reactive derivative thereof in which reaction any reactive groups in the groups R1 andR2 may be protected, if desired EMI2.2 wherein R and R are as defined in relation to formula I and PX is a carboxy blocking group, with an aziridine derivative of the formula III in which any reactive groups in the group R3 may be protected, if desired EMI3.1 3 wherein R is as defined in relation to formula I and thereafter optionally performing one or more of the following steps i removing any protecting groups in the groups R1, Rand R ii removing any carboxy blocking group iii converting the product into an ester, salt or acid. Preferably in the compounds of the formula I either R or P is a hydrogen atom. In an alternative aspect both R1 and R2 are hydrogen atoms. 2 When the group R1 or P represents an organic group, it may be selected from C1 10 alkyl, C2 10 alkenyl, C2 10 alkynyl, C3 7 cycloalkyl C1,6 alkyl,C3 7 cycloalkyl, aryl, aryl C1,6 alkyl, heterocyclyl, heterocyclyl C1,6 alkyl, heteroaryl and heteroaryl C1,6 alkyl, any of the above groups being optionally substituted.

Preferred values for COR3 therefore include the acetyl, propionyl, aminoacetyl, benzoyl, furoyl, thenoyl, methylaminocarbonyl and dimethylaminocarbonyl groups, of these the aminoacetyl group is particularly preferred. The major utility of the compounds prepared by the process of this invention is as pharmaceuticals and accordingly the salts and esters of the compounds of the formula I are preferably pharmaceutically acceptable.The compounds of this invention both pharmaceutically acceptable and non pharmaceutically acceptable may be used as intermediates and also as antibacterial agents or P lactamase inhibitors in non pharmaceutical usage such as a disinfectant or paint additive.

Of these the sodium and potassium salts are preferred. It is to be realised that if a free alkylamino group CH2 NH2 is present in the group R3 then a zwitterion of the compound of the formula I may be formed, said zwitterion normally being formed with the carboxylic acid function at the C 2 position. If a carboxylic acid group is present in the group R3 then optionally this may be salified by a pharmaceutically acceptable salt as hereinbefore described. Suitable esters of the compounds of the formula I include those cleavable by biological methods such as enzy matic hydrolysis, in vivo hydrolysis, and those cleavable by chemical methods such as hydrogenolysis, hydrolysis, electrolysis or photolysis. Suitably the carboxylic acid is esterified by a group of the sub formula a , b , c , d , e or f EMI10.1 wherein A1 is a hydrogen atom, C C1 6 alkanoyl or an C 1 5 alkyl group optionally substituted by C1 7 alkoxy or C1,7 carboxylic acyloxy, or an alkenyl or alkynyl group of up to 5 carbon atoms A is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group A3 is a phenyl group or a phenyl group substituted by a fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom or a nitro, C1 3 alkyl or C1 3 alkoxy group A4 is a hydrogen atom or a pheyl group or phenyl group substituted by a fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom or a nitro, C1 3 alkyl or C1 3 alkoxy group A5 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group A is a C1 6 alkyl, phenyl, phenoxy, phenyl C1 3 alkyl, phenyl C1 3 alkoxy or C1 4 alkoxy group or A5 is joined to A6 to form a phthalidyl, dimethylphthalidyl or dimethoxyphthalidyl group A7 is a C1 4 alkyl, phenyl, chlorophenyl or nitrophenyl group A is a C1 4 alkyl or phenyl group 10A9 is a C14 alkyl or phenyl group A is C1 4 alkyl and A is a C1 4 alkyl or CHA1A2 is a phenacyl or bromophenacyl group.

Preferred groups of the sub formula a include the methyl, ethyl and acetonyl groups. Preferred groups of the sub formula b include the benzyl and p nitrobenzyl groups. When A5 is hydrogen, suitably A6 is selected from methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, tert butyl, phenyl, benzyl, methoxy, ethoxy, n propyloxy and isopropyloxy. Preferably A6 is tert butyl. Preferred groups of the sub formula c include the acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, phthalidyl, a ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl and a acetoxyethyl groups.These esterifying groups are favoured as they tend to form in vivo hydrolysable esters. A preferred group of the sub formula d is the methoxymethyl group. Preferred groups of the sub formula e include the trimethylsilyl, tert butyldimethylsilyl and tertbutyldiphenylsilyl groups. A preferred group of the sub formula f is p methoxycarbonylbenzyl. Particularly preferred esterifying groups are the p nitrobenzyl and phthalidyl groups. Pharmaceutically acceptable in vivo hydrolysable esters are those esters which hydrolyse in the human body to produce the parent acid or its salt. Such esters may be identified by administration to a test animal such as a rat or mouse by intravenous administration and thereafter exaining the test animal s body fluids for the presence of the compound of the formula I or salt. Suitable esters of this type include those of sub formula c as hereinbefore defined. Further suitable esters include di Cl 6 alkylamino C1 6 alkyl esters such as dimethylaminomethyl, dimethylaminoethyl, diethylaminomethyl and diethylaminoethyl. Compounds of the formula I in the form of chemically cleavable esters are also of value as intermediates. Such chemically cleavable esters are preferably formed at the carboxylic acid function at theC 2 position. Suitably the esters of use as intermediates are those cleavable by catalytic hydrogenation, for example a benzyl ester optionally substituted by C13 alkoxy, C13 alkanoyloxy, halogen or a nitro group. Of these the p nitrobenzyl ester is preferred. During the process of this invention, any reactive groups in the groups R1, R2 and R3 may be protected. For example if R3 contains an amino group it may be protected by a protected amino group such as those known in the art, for example enamino groups, or p nitrobenzyloxycarbonylamino which on hydrogenation affords an amino group. Any carbonyl group in R3 may be esterified which on hydrogenation affords a carboxylic acid or salt thereof. It must be realised that salts of the compounds of the formulae I formed with pharmaceutically unacceptable ions are useful as they may serve as intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts by ion exchange, or they may be useful as intermediates in the preparation of in vivo hydrolysable esters. An example of such a salt is the lithium salt, which may be converted into other salts such as the sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium salt by ion exchange. Suitably R in the compound of the formula II is an ester, suitably a cleavable ester or an in vivo hydrolysable ester. Suitably cleavable esters of the formula II for use in such a process are those that are cleavable by chemical methods. Apt esters include those cleavable by hydrogenation, for example a benzyl ester optionally substituted by Cl,g alkoxy, C1,3 alkanoyloxy, halogen or a nitro group. Of these the p nitrobenzyl ester is preferred. Other apt esters for use in this process are in vivo hydrolysable esters as hereinbefore described. The reaction of an ester of a compound of the formula II with the aziridine derivative normally takes place in an inert organic solvent such as dimethyl formamide, dichloromethane or chloroform. The reaction is normally carried out at a non extreme temperature for example 300C to 500C, preferably OOC to 300C, and most conveniently at ambient temperature. The reaction is normally conducted in the presence of a base such as potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium and lithium, carbonate or bicarbonate, preferably such bases being in an anhydrous form. Organic bases may be suitable also, for example triethylamine. Suitable methods of hydrogenolysis for the preparation of compounds of the formula I include hydrogenation in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. The pressure of hydrogen used in the hydrogenation step may be low, medium or high, but in general an approximately atmospheric or slightly superatmospheric pressure is preferred. The transition metal catalyst employed is preferably palladium for example palladium on charcoal, palladium on barium sulphate or palladium on calcium carbonate. The hydrogenation may be effected in any convenient solvent in which the compound is soluble such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, ethanol, or such solvents in mixture with water.Phosphate buffer may also be included in the hydrogenation medium, this is particularly advantageous if it is desired to produce the compound of the formula I in the form of a zwitterion. If the hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of a base then a salt of a compound of the formula I is produced. Suitable bases include sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate and lithium carbonate. If no base is present then hydrogenation leads to the preparation of an acid of a compound of the formula I which may then may be neutralised if desired to yield a salt, such neutralisation being effected in conventional manner. Re esterification of a carboxyl group of a salt of a compound of the formula I may be effected in conventional manner. Suitable methods include the reaction of an alkali metal salt of the compound of the formula I such as the sodium or potassium salt with a reactive halide or sulphonate ester such as a bromide, chloride, mesylate or tosylate. Such esterification may be carried out under conventional conditions for example in dimethylformamide at room temperature. Comppunds of the formula II may be prepared by the reaction of N bromoacetamide with a corresponding compound of the formula VII EMI17.1 wherein R1, R2 and Rx are as defined in relation to formula II . The reaction of the ester of the compound of the formula VII with N bromoacetamide is most suitably carried out at a temperature such as 15 l50C to 250C in a solvent such as moist acetone or dioxan. The desired product may be obtained by diluting with chloroform, washing with water and evaporating the dried organic layer. The compounds of the formula VII and esters thereof may be obtainable directly from natural sources, or may be prepared by the modification of natural products. For example they may be prepared by the methods disclosed in UK Patent Specification Number 1489235, European Patent Application PublicationNumbers 0004132, 0005349, 0007152 and 0005348,United States Serial Numbers 014,995 and 025,556 andJapanese Application Numbers 25014 79, 56215 79, 50233 79 and 56214 79, European Patent Application PublicationNumbers 0001627 and 0001628 and OLS 2724560. The groups R1 and R2 may be modified by such methods as are known for the modification of the C 6 substituent of known carbapenem derivatives. This may be performed after the formation of the S CH2 CH2 NHCOR side chain at the C 3 postion. Certain compounds produced by the process of this invention are novel.
