# Printwheel homing apparatus.

## Abstract
In a printwheel type of printer using a selection stepper motor 20 for driving the printwheel 18 , means are provided for performing printwheel homing operation upon occurr ence of predetermined events. Such an event, is detected and reported to microprocessor means 36 which drive motion means 14 for bringing the printer carriage assembly 8 to a first extreme left position where a stop element 58 fixed relative to the printwheel rotation is made to enter the path of another stop element 61 attached to rotate with the print wheel. Subsequently, the selection stepper motor 20 driving the printwheel is driven for a number of steps at least equal to one motor revolution to ensure reaching inhibition of the printwheel rotation by bringing the rotating stop element 58 into contact with the relatively fixed stop element 61 . The carriage 8 is then moved back to the left margin writing position where the relatively fixed stop element is withdrawn from the path of the other stop element and the angular printwheel home position is noted and stored by micro processor means 40 .
