The compounds of formula A are useful for imaging of the brain. As will therefore be appreciated, the compounds of formula A demonstrate rapid accumulation in the brain indicative of an ability to penetrate the so termed blood brain barrier. The compounds of formula A demonstrate a marked superiority in stability of the iodine carbon bond in vivoThe stability of the carbon iodine bond in vivo in combination with the ability to penetrate the blood brain barrier enable the compounds of formula A to demonstrate rapid localization of the radioiodine in the brain following intravenous administration. In addition to the primary localization in the brain, the compounds of formulaA also show localization in the heart, adrenals and pancreas. The stability of the iodine label in vivo i.e., in the brain, and the ability to penetrate the blood brain barrier are distinct advantages of the compounds of formula A in their use as brain imaging agents. As utilized herein, the term alkyl indicates a straight or branched chain radical containing from 1 to 18 carbon atoms such as, for example, methyl, n propyl, isopropyl, tertiary butyl, n hexyl, n octadecyl and the like. The term lower alkyl denotes a straight or branched chain alkyl radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.The term aryl as utilized herein means an aromatic, mononuclear or polynuclear hydrocarbon such as, for example, phenyl, naphthyl and phenanthryl, with phenyl being preferred. The alkyl portion of aralkyl as utilized herein is a straight or branched chain alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Preferred aralkyl radicals are benzyl, phenylisopropyl and phenethyl.

Of these, I 123 is particularly preferred in the practice of the invention. Because the half life of I 123 is only 13 hours, however, it is necessary that the procedures utilized to label organic compounds therewith be both rapid and efficient. Further, it is necessary, as with any radiolabeled compound, that the radiolabel in the case of radioiodinated compounds, the iodine to carbon bond be stable in vivo with minimal loss of radionuclide from the labeled compound after its administration to the patient.

The compounds of formula A can be prepared by methods recognized in the art. For example, a compound of formula A may be prepared by reacting a compound represented by the formulaEMI4.1 wherein I, x, n, R1 and R2 are as previously defined, y is 1 and z is 0 and Hal is chloro, bromo or iodo, with an amine represented by the formula EMI5.1 wherein R3 and R4 are as previously defined. For the above reaction, the amine may be utilized to create alkaline conditions, i.e. added in excess, or the reactants may be present in stoichiometric quantities and the reaction carried out in the presence of a suitable base such as, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and the like. The reaction is carried out at ambient temperature or with heating, e.g. at a temperature up to about 2000C, preferably at about 25 0C. Certain compounds oft formula A are prepared by reacting a compound of formula A wherein at least one of R3 and R4 is hydrogen with a compound represented by the formula Hal R3 or R4 D wherein Hal is chloro, iodo or bromo and R3 and H4 are as defined above with the exception that they are not aryl. The reaction with the compound of formula D is preferably conducted under the same general conditions as for the reaction of compounds of formulae B and C. Generally, the amine can be used as a solvent for the reaction if it is a liquid. The reactants can also be dissolved in a suitable inert organic solvent such as, for example, ethyl ether, methanol, ethyl acetate, dioxane, methylene chloride, benzene, N,N dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran and the like with ethyl ether and methanol being preferred. The amine compounds of formulae A and C may also be reacted in the form of their acid additional salts utilizing an appropriate base to generate the free amine in situ. Certain compounds of formula A may also be prepared by reacting a compound of formula A wherein at least one of R3 and R4 is hydrogen with an aldehyde or ketone represented by the formulaEMI6.1 wherein R3 and R4 are as defined above to form the corresponding Schiff base and then reducing the Schiff base chemically or catalytically. Compounds of formula A wherein R3 and R4 together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form a 5or 6 membered ring may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula A wherein R3 and R4 are hydrogen with a compound represented b the formulaEMI6.2 wherein n is 2 or 3. The reduction of the Schiff base as described above may be carried out either chemically or catalytically by methods well known in the art. A preferred chemical method for reduction of the Schiff base utilizes an alkali metal cyanoborohydride as the reducing agent in a suitable organic solvent such as, for example, methanol, dioxane and tetrahydrofuran, with methanol being preferred. Compounds of formula A wherein z is 0, y is 1 to 3 and R3 and R4 are each hydrogen may be prepared by the reduction, preferably chemically, of a compound represented by the formula EMI7.1 wherein R and x are as defined above and y is 0 to 2.The chemical reduction is preferably carried out using a boron hydride such as, for example, borane tetrahydrofuran or an alkÅali metal aluminum hydride such as lithium aluminum hydride or the like at Åa temperature of from about OOC to about 1O00C, preferably 25 0C in an organic solvent such as ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and 1,2 dimethoxymethane, with tetrahydrofuran being preferred. Finally, compounds of formula A wherein I is in position para may be prepared by the iodination of an amine having the amine group protected, e.g. by an alkanoyl group, i.e. a compound represented by the formulaEMI7.2 wherein R, R1, R2, R3, R4, x, y and z are as defined above except that no R is in the para position and Alk is an alkanoyl group, and subsequently removing the protecting alkanoyl group by conventional methods. The iodination is carried out by conventional methods such as utilizing iodine in the presence of an oxidizing agent such as iodic acid or nitric acid at elevated temperatures. The alkanoyl protecting group can be removed, for example, by hydrolyzing in acid medium under reflux. The above reactions can be carried out utilizing the respective compounds wherein I is stable iodine and not a radioisotope of iodine under the same conditions. The resulting compounds wherein I is stable iodine i.e. the cold compound, are then exchange labeled with a radioisotope of iodine, preferably I 123. For the exchange radiolabeling process, an inorganic salt of a radioisotope of iodine, preferably an alkali metal salt and most preferably the sodium salt is utilized. The salt is heated with the cold compound of formula A i. e. a compound of formula A wherein I is stable iodine and not a radioisotope of iodine for from about 1t4 to about 2 hours. The exchange radiolabeling is carried out in the presence of an inert organic solvent such as, for example, a lower alcohol or those named above. The radiolabeled compound of formula A is then dissol ved,.i a suitable solvent e.g. ethyl ether, and washed with aqueous sodium bisulfite solution to remove unexchanged radioiodine. The product is then extracted into hydrochloric acid and washed with a suitable water immi scitè organic solvent e.g. ethyl ether, then basified with a suitable aqueous base and re extracted into the organic solvent. The organic solution is then evaporated ò dryness to obtain a pure labeled product. The radiolabeling procedure described above may likewise be carried out starting with an acid addition salt of 9 compound of formula A by treating it with a suitable base arid then extracting the free amine with a suitable organic solvent such as those named above. Tntermediate compounds such as, for example, those of formula B above canberadiolabeled in a like manner and then reacted as discussed above to form the corres ponding compound of formula A. Many of the cold compounds of formulae A through H are known compounds. In addition to the partition procedure described above, the radiolabeled compounds of formula A and the intermediates can be purified by preparative thin layer chromatography and liquid chromatography utilizing procedures well known in the art. The compounds of formula A can be rapidly prepared, e.g. by exchange radiolabeling. This is advantageous because of the criticality of time in the handling of radioisotopes which have a comparatively short half life such as iodine I 123. The compounds of formula A as well as the corresponding cold compounds can be converted to their respective pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts by methods conventional in the art, for example, by direct reaction with the appropriate acid. The hydrochloride can be prepared, for example, by contacting a solution of the amine of formula A in a suitable organic solvent with hydrogen chloride gas and recovering the precipitated amine hydrochloride. As stated above, the radioiodine containing compounds of the invention rapidly localize in the brain following intravenous administration. In most instances, a sufficient amount of the administered dose will accumulate in the brain within from about one to ten minutes to permit the taking of scintiphotos. The compounds of the invention will show meaningful presence in the brain for at least 15 minutes so that significant studies may be carried out. In addition to the brain, the compounds of formula A will also accumulate in myocardium, adrenals and pancreas to varying degrees. The radioiodinated compounds of the subject invention may be administered in an aqueous or aqueous alcoholic medium. Such media may also contain conventional pharma ceutical adjunct materials such as, for example, pharma ceutically acceptable salts to adjust the osmotic pressure, buffers, preservatives and the lke. A preferred vehicle for the parenteral administration of the compounds of formula A is normal saline which would contain from about 0.5 by weight to about 2 by weightof a suitable preservative.

The ratio of brain to blood activity was calculated as a percent of administered dose per gram. The results for blood, brain and heart as well as the brain blood ratio are reported in table I. For comparative purposes,I 123 antipyrine was utilized as a standard.
