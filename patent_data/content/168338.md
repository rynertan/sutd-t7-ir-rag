# LAMINATE FOR MAKING TUBES

## Abstract
The stiffness and deadfold properties of laminates used to make toothpaste tubes are improved by including a layer of high density polyethylene as one of the layers of the laminate. The use of high density polyethylene obviates the need to use a layer of paper or thick foil to provide stiffness and deadfold. The laminates containing high density polyethylene also have excellent strength and other prop erties which make them especially suitable for making tubes used to package toothpaste or other substances.
