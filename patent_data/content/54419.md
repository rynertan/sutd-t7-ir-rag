# Tracking control arrangement in a magnetic recording and reproducing device.

## Abstract
A tracking control arrangement for a video tape recorder effects simultaneous recording and then simultaneous re production of four channel recording tracks TRa, TRb, TRc, TRd formed on a magnetic tape 2 under tracking control effected by detecting tracking error in dependence on the phase difference between reproduced signals from two adjacent recording tracks TRc, TRd of the four at the time of reproduction, the adjacent two recording tracks TRc, TRd being recorded with different azimuth angles. A signal delayed by a delay circuit 100 with respect to the signal recorded in one TRd of the two adjacent recording tracks is recorded in the other one TRc of the two adjacent recording tracks, thereby permitting tracking control by bimorph plate 3A, 3B or capstan servo control 106 in dependence on the phase difference between the reproduced signals produced from two magnetic heads 1C, 1D corresponding to the two adjacent recording tracks TRc, TRd .
