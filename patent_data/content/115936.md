BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Insorar as an in vitro gene manipulation technology is concerned, it is required that a vector which is accepted by a host is available to allow a foreign DNA to migrate in a cell of the host and to allow the foreign DNA to express the genetic information thereof in the cell of the host. The behavDurof a vector is clear, to a considerable extent, for the host vector system in which Escherichia coli is employed, because efforts have been concentrated thereon so far.At present, however, much effort is being employed to develop host vector systems which employ various microorganisms other than E. coli, such as Bacillus subtilis which is one of the microorganisms useful from the industrial view point, Actinomycetes which are microorganisms capable of producing antibiotics, and yeast which is widely employed for brewing. The fundamental requirements for a vector are that the vector has a gene arrangement which is necessary for replication and that the vector has a recognition and cleavage site for a restriction enzyme at which a foreign DNA is inserted.From the practical viewpoint, however, various additional items tabulated below are required for a vector 1. Each of the specific restriction enzymes which can be employed for specific gene manipulation has a recogni tion and cleavage site which is convenient in later steps in the specific gene manipulation process.2. The vector has a high efficiency in expression of genetic information. J. The vector has a marker gene which is necessary for detection of a transformant.4. The vector is readily accepted by a specific host, and the vector has a convenient host range.5. The vector remains stable in a specific host without incurring disturbances.6. The vector Permits a biological confinement which is aimed at reducing the possibility of any potential biological hazards.This is the reason why only a few successful cases have been reported for vectors even within the category of host vector systems employing E. coli orB. subtilis. In the light of the aforementioned considerations, we have been using our best effortsnto prepare plasmid vectors useful for the ultimate purpose of developing hostvector systems which employ E. coli the biological properties of which are well known, and B. subtilis,which is useful industrially to produce amylase etc As a result, we have been successful in developing a variety of chimeric plasmids which are synthesized from a plasmid retained by Streptococcus faecalis, pAMO 1, and a vector applicable to E. coli, pACYC177, and which are excellent vectors for gene manipulation employing E. coli orB. subtilis. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides a chimeric plasmid comprising a a tetracycline resistant gene deriving from pAMoL1, one of the plasmids retained by Streptococcus faecalis, b an ampicillin resistant gene deriving from pACYC177, one of the vectors applicable to Escherichia coil1 and c at least one of i an area at which replication originates deriving from said plasmid pAMo l, and ii an area at which replication originates deriving from said vector pACYC177, said tetracycline resistant gene containing only one site at which said chimeric plasmid is recognized and cleaved by the restriction enzyme BalI and said ampicillin resistant gene containing only one site at which said chimeric plasmid is recognized and cleaved by the restriction enzymes BglI and PstI. The invention also provides a process for preparing the plasmid, which process comprises cleaving pAMil, a plasmid retained by Streptococcus faecalis DS5 ATCC14508 , and pACYC177, a vector applicable to Escherichia coli1 and ligating the cleaved DNA fragments of said plasmid and vector to include a tetracycline resistant gene Tc deriving from the aforementioned pAMtl, an ampicillin resistant gene Amp deriving from the aforementioned pACYC177 and either or both of i an area at which replication originates deriving from said plasmid pAMo l, and ii an area at which replication originates deriving from said vector pACYC177 The invention provides also a method employing a vector to convey a gene into a host cell, usually of a microorganism, especially a bacterium, which may be a gram positive or gram negative bacterium, especiallyEscherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis, in which method the present chimeric plasmid is used as vector. The invention provides also of course the host produced by this method including the descendents of the immediate host . The invention also provides biosynthesis employing a gene cloned by this host. The invention also provides a microorganism as deposited at the Fermentation Research Institute Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Japan, under the deposition number FERM BP 436, FERM BP 437, FERM BP 438,FERM BP 439, FERM BP 441, FERM BP 442, FERM BP 443, FERM BP 444, FERM BP 445 or FERM BP 446. The variety of chimeric plasmids in accordance with the present invention is a variety of chimeric plasmids which can be produced by cleaving pAMil, a plasmid retained by Streptococcus faecalis DS5 ATCC14508 , and pACYC177, a vector applicable to Escherichia coli and by ligating the cleavedDNA fragments of said plasmid and vector to include a tetracycline resistant gene Tc deriving from the aforementioned pAMGCl, an ampicillin resistant gene Amp deriving from the aforementioned pACYC177 and either or both of the origin OripAMil deriving from the aforementioned p2iNdl and the origin Oril77 deriving from the aforementioned pACYC177. The chimeric plasmids included in the aforementioned genus category are classified, following the difference in the reduced molecular weight, into the 10 species designad pHY780, pHY6OO, pHY460, pHY385, pHY360, pHY340, pHY330, pHY310, pHY285 and pHY225. Since each of the chimeric plasmids has a tetracycline resistant gene and an ampicillin resistant gene in its DNA, they have the capability of providing a host with resistance against both tetracycline and ampicillin during the transformation process applied toE. coli. They also have the capability of providing a host with resistance against tetracycline during the transformation process applied to Bacillus subtilis.This genetic nature can function as a marker for detection and selection of a transformant or a host which retains a chimeric plasmid in which a desired foreign DNA is to be inserted. Further, since the tetracycline resistant gene of any of the chimeric plasmids in accordance with the present invention contains only one site at which the chimeric plasmid is recognized and cleaved by the restriction enzyme Ball, and also since the ampicillin resistant gene of any of the same chimeric plasmids contains only one site at which the chimeric plasmid is recognized and cleaved by either of the restriction enzymes BglI and PstI, no more fragments than are required are produced from any of the chimeric plasmids in accordance with the present invention, provided the restriction enzymes employed for the cleavage are limited to the aforementioned ones. Accordingly, a foreign DNA can be inserted in one of the aforementioned single sites at which the chimeric plasmid is recognized and cleaved by one of the aforementioned restriction enzymes. The tetracycline resistant gene is cleaved by the restriction enzyme BalI to form a pair of flush ends at the centre of the 6 nucleotide sequence of the DNA. Thus, it is possible, without utilizing T4 DNA polymerase or S1 nuclease, to ligate the aforementioned flush ends with any of the foreign DNA fragments each of which has a pair of flush ends. No limitations are imposed on the method of production of the foreign DNA s having flush ends. In other words, not only the aforementioned restriction enzymes but also any other restriction enzymes which produce flush ends can be employed for preparation of the foreign DNA s.Further, it is possible to produce a ligated DNA employing foreign DNA fragments having artifi cially produced flush ends. Out of the chimeric plasmids in accordance with the present invention, pHY46O, pHYB85, pHY360, pHY340 and pHY310 function as shuttle vectors which are applicable both to E. coii and B. subtilis.This is because the aforementioned two independent origins, namely Orip 9l, the origin deriving from the plasmid, pAMoCH, and Oril77, tne origin deriving from the vector, pACYC177, both ot which are contained in any of tese chimeric plasmids in accordance with the present invention, are correctly interpreted and allowed to enjoy stable replications not only in E. coli but also in B. subtilis, thus being able to express the tetracycline resistant gene at least in each of E coli and B. subtilis. The DNA cloning system whose research and development has been most extensively achieved is the vector system CEK system employing E. coli, one of the gram negative bacteria and its vectors. In accordance with this system, genes deriving from the gram negative bacteria and some specific genes deriving from gram positive bacteria can be expressed In contrast, many problems still remain unsolved for the system employing gram positive bacteria. This is the reason why a considerable amount of attention is paid to this subject. Particularly,though B. subtilis is a group of useful microorganisms which have a number of practical advantages, their biological properties are entirely different from those of E. coli.Thus, the study of the genetic information of B. subtilis and the development of a cloning system employing the same bacteria have become matters of great interest. In these circumstances, the industry is eager to develop a host vector system employing B. subtilis.Therefore, our success in development of a variety of shuttle vectors which are applicable both to E. coli, one of the typical bacteria belonging to gram negative bacteria, and to B. subtilis, one of the typical bacteria belonging to gram positive bacteria, is very significant, because it is recognized as a milestone to reach a DNA cloning system employing gram positive bacteria. Accordingly, it is clear that the chimeric plasmids in accordance with the present invention are useful from the industrial viewpoint. In addition, since possibilities may exist for utilization of chimeric plasmids in accordance with the present invention for the purposes of gene analysis and molecular breeding of other gram positive bacteria, e.g. those belonging to Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and the like, chimeric plasmids in accordance with the present invention are promising from this viewpoint of industrial application.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION A more detailed description will now be presented for specific chimeric plasmids in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. EMBODIMENT 1 CHIMERIC PLASMID, pHY780 1 Preparation of pACYCl77 E. coli K12 WA802rm pACYC177 owned by Dr. H. Saito,Research Institute for Applied Microorganismst TokyoUniversity was cultivated overnight in L broth A broth produced by adjusting the pH value of the mixture containing 1 of bactotrypton, 0.5 of yeast extract, 0.5 ofNaCl, 0.1 of glucose, to 7.0 employing lN NaOH . The cultivated bacteria were harvested by centrifugation before they were twice washed with 100 ml of 20 mM Tris 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0 . The washed bacteria were resuspended in 9 ml of 20 mM Tris 10 mM EDTA. Lysozyme and RNase were added to the suspension in the quantity required to make respectively 100 Ug ml and 50 g ml, before lysing reaction is allowed to occur at OOC for 10 minutes. The bacteria which were subjected to the aforementioned lysing reaction wereadmixedwith 1 ml of 2 SDS and were further lysed at 370C for 5 minutes. After being kept at OOC for 10 minutes, the solution was centrifuged at 36,000 rpm for 30 minutes to collect the supernatant thereof. Cesium chloride ethidium bromide density gradient centrifugation was applied to the supernatant or a DNA crude sample of the desired DNA, in order to obtain the desired DNA out of the DNA crude sample. For this purpose, the DNA crude sample was admixed with the crystalline cesium chloride In the quantity identical to that of the DNA crude sample and with 0.7 ml of ethidium bromide having a concentration of 5 mg ml to prepare a solution containing the desired cccDNA, pACYC177. The solution was centrifuged twice at 36,000 rpm for 40 hours to collect the cesium chloride fractions containing the desired cccDNA. The collected cesium chloride fractions containing the desired cccDNA were washed with isopropanol saturated with cesium chloride to exclude ethidium bromide. The cccDNA dissolved in the cesium chloride solution was dialysed against a buffer A containing 10 mM tris 0.1 mM EDTA and having the pH value 7.4, before the dialysed cccDNA dissolved in the buffer A was admixed with phenol saturated with the same buffer, in the quantity required to increase the entire volume twice. The mixture was shaken to allow a small quantity of protein to be denatured, before the protein was allowed to travel to the boundary portion sandwiched between two liquid layers, the upper layer containing the desired cccDNA and the lower layer consisting of the phenol, which were separated from each other by centrifugation in order to collect the desired cccDNA.The upper layer was further dialysed against the buffer A to exclude the phenol which contaminated the desired cccDNA, to purify the desired cccDNA, pACYC177. By the foregoing processes, pACYC177 whose cleavage map is shown by A in Fig. 1 A was prepared 2 Preparation of pail S. faecalis DS5 ATCC14508 was cultivated overnight in Rogosats medium a medium having the pH value 6.8 and of which 1 litre contains 20 g of glucose, 10 g of trypticase peptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 3 g of tryptose, 3 g of K2HPO4, 3 g of KH2PO4, 2 g of ammonium citrate, 1 g of sodium acetate, 1 g of Tween 80, 0.575 g of MgSO4.H2O, 0.5 g of L cystine hydrochloride, 0.12 g of MnSO42H2O and 84 mg of Fe504 7H2O . Processes similar to those which have been described above in 1 of this section for preparation of pACYC177, were employed to collect the DNA crude sample of DNA s retained by S. faecalis. The DNA sample which had been obtained from the DNA crude sample employing cesium chloride ethidium bromide density gradient centrifugation, was further applied to sucrose density gradient centrifugation in order to selectively obtain the desired cccDNA, pAMgl from the mixture containing pAMAl and pAMPl other than pAMAl. Namely, 0.5 ml of the DNA sample was put on 12 ml of sucrose solution having the 5 30 density gradient which was prepared in a nitrocellulose tube. The buffer which was employed in this process was a mixture of 50 mM Tris 50 mM EDTA 50 mM Nail, pH 8.0 . Centrifugation was employed at 100C at 20,000 rpm for 16 hours to split the DNA sample to a plurality of DNA groups each of which contains a part of the DNA sample having a specific molecular weight. To collect each of the DNA groups individually, an opening was produced at the bottom of the nitrocellulose tube and a plurality of fractions consisting of 10 drops were collected. 0.8 agarose gel electrophoresis process was applied to 10,41 each of the aforementioned fractions in order to determine the molecular weight of theDNA s contained in the specific fraction. The fractions containing the DNA s having the molecular weight 6Md were selectively collected, before they were dialysed against the buffer A. In this manner, pAMil whose cleavage map is shown by B in Fig. 1 A , was prepared. 3 Cleavage of pACYC177 and pAMo 1 and Ligation of the cleaved DNA fragments of pACYC177 and pAMOGl 1 1 of a buffer a mixture containing 100 mM of Tris HC1 having the pH value 7.6, 70 mM of MgCl2, 70 mM ofa mercaptoethanol and 500 mM of NaCl and 1,41 of HindIII having an activity of 4 units were dropped in l0 l each of the DNA solution containing 0.1 0.2 g of the DNA s produced and collected employing the foregoing processes described in 1 and 2 , to allow HindIII to digest theDNA s at 370C.As a result, both DNA s contained in the aforementioned DNA solution pACYC177 and pAMXl were recognized and cleaved at the recognition and cleavage site of HindIII. Atter digestion for 60 minutes the mixture was heated at 60 C for 10 minutes to terminate the digestion. After the mixture was admixed with 5 M of NaC1 by the 1 50 volume and further with ethanol at the temperature of 200C in the quantity twice as much as the entire quantity of the mixture, it was kept at 200C for 30 minutes. After the mixture was centrifuged at 0 C at a speed of 15,000 rpm for 5 minutes, the precipitate was collected, before it was washed with ethanol of 200C. After the washed precipitate was centrifuged at 0 C at 15,000 rpm for 2 minutes, it was entirely dried. The DNA fragments acquired by the foregoing process were dissolved in 20 1 of sterilized water The water containing the DNA fragments was admixed with a mixture containing 3fi1 of 10 mM ATP, 3,41 of 100 mM dithiothreitol, 3fl1 of 660 mM tris HC1 pH 7.6 66 mM MgC12 and Q.5 1 of T4 ligase having an activity of 400 units fil. Ligated in this process were a linear DNA fragment which was produced by allowing Hindili to digest pACYC177 and each of two linear DNA fragments,a smalleroneandalarger one, which were produced by allowing the same restriction enzyme to digest pkSAl. After this ligation process was allowed to occur at 150C overnight, 120 1 of sterilized water was pouredintothe mixture until the entire quantity was increased to 150 Y1. 4 Transformation of Echerichia coli E. coli K12 C600r m owned by Dr. H. Saito, ResearchInstitute for Applied Microorganisms, Tokyo University was cultivated overnight in L broth. 0.05 ml of this culture was inoculated in 5 ml of L broth, to cultivate the same micro organism on a shaker at 370C for 130 minutes. The culture was centrifuged to collect the cells. After the cells were washed with 0.1 M of Caul2 solution at 0 C, the washed cells were suspended in 0.25 ml of the 0.1 M Caul2 solution at OOC to produce competent cells of the aforementioned microorganism.0.1 ml each of the competent cells and the ligated DNA s produced employing the foregoing process described in 3 , were put together with each other and kept at OOC for 5 minutes to allow the competent cells to be transformed with the aforementioned ligated DNA s. The transformants were cultivated at 37 C for one hour in l ml of a culture containing 0.8 ml of L broth. The culture was applied to a medium containingL broth as well as agar, tetracycline and ampicillin in the respective quantities of 1.5 of the L broth volume, 2Ofig ml and 30 units ml, to be cultivated overnight at 370C in order to see that the transformants had actually obtained the resistance against tetracycline and or ampicillin.Since the transformants were successfully cultivated on the medium containing tetracycline and ampicillin, it was determined that the transformants had readily obtained the resistance against tetracycline and ampicillin. 10 colonies which grew on the medium containing tetracycline and ampicillin were picked up, and the picked up transformants were subjected to a series of examinations described below to determine the dimension of the plasmid DNA retained therein. 5 Extraction of the retained plasmid DNA and measurement of the molecular weiqht thereof The aforementioned transformants were cultivated overnight in L broth. Centrifugation was applied to 5 ml of the culture to selectively collect the transformants. The separated transformants were suspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mM tris 10 mM EPTA CpH 7.4 . This suspension wasadnuxed with 0.2 ml of a mixture containing 2 mg ml of lysozyme and 0.5 mg ml of RNase to lyse the transformants at 370C for 5 minutes. The solution was furtheradmixedwith 0.2 ml of 2 SDS solution to further lyse the transformants completely at 30 C for 1 to 2 minutes.After being kept at OOC for 10 minutes, this solution was centrifuged at OOC at 20,000 rpm for 10 minutes. 0.5 ml of the supernatant was carefully mixed with 0.5 ml of phenol saturated with buffer A to allow the undesired protein to be denatured with the phenol. The mixture was centrifuged at room temperature at 15,000 rpm for 3 minutes, and the upper layer which was separated from the lower layer was collected. 50 1 of the collected upper layer was applied with electrophoresis process on a Q.8 agarose gel to determine the molecular weight of the plasmid DNA retained in each transformant. The aforementioned sequencial process for determination of the molecular weight of a material was applied to 10 independent colonies of the transformants. The results showed the molecular weight of the plasmid DNA was approximately 7.8 Md. In this manner, a new chimeric plasmid whose cleavage map zs shown by C in Fig. 1 A was synthesized from pACYClV7 whose cleavage map i.s shown by A in Fig. 1 A and pAM whose cleavage map is shown by B in Fig. 1 A .This new chimeric plasmid was named pHY780. Another chimeric plasmid which was simultaneously synthesized in the same process was named pHYll. The foregoing description confirms that pHY780 exhibits stable replications and expression of genetic information thereof at least in E. cold. Ligation of the DNA fragments of pACYC177 and of pAMil produces two independent chimeric plasmids, pHY780 and pHYll1 whose molecular weights are the same as each other, due to alternative directions in which the DNA fragments are ligated. However, a cleaving process by means of BamHI allows the two independent chimeric plasmids to be sorted from each other, because the BamHI cleaving process produces two independent groups each of which is of dimension different from each other. Further investigation was carried out for a variety of restriction enzymes which can be employed for removal of a portion or portions of each of pHY780 and pHYll without losing at least both of the origins, OripAMCl and Oril77, and also without causing any damage to two independent genes, Tc and Amp . A larger variety of restriction enzymes available for pHY780, made it reasonable to choose pHy780, because this allowed easier shortening processes to follow. EMBODIMENT 2 CHIMERIC PLASMID, pHY600 1 Cleavage of pHY780 and ligation of the cleaved DNA fragment of pHY780 A transformed E. coli C600r m pHY780 produced inEMBODIMENT 1, was subjected to an extraction process similar to that which has been described in 5 for EMBODIMENT 1, in order to extract the retained plasmid DNA. 2,41 of a buffer a mixture containing 100 mM of Tris HCI having the pH value 7.6, 70 mM of MgC12, 70 mM ofB mercaptoethanol and 500 mM of NaCl and BamHI of 4 units were dropped in 1 g 20 l of the extracted DNA, and BamHI was allowed to digest the extracted DNA at 37 C. After the digestion had lasted for 60 minutes, the digested DNA was heated at 600C for 10 minutes to terminate the digestion.After the digested DNA was admixed with 80,41 of water, 2 1 of 5 M NaCl and 200,41 of ethanol at the temperature of 200C, it was kept at 200C for 30 minutes. The digestedDNA was centrifuged at 0 C at 10,000 rpm fdr 5 minutes to collect a desired DNA. After the collected DNA was washed with 20041 of ethanol at 200C, the DNA was dried. The dried DNA was dissolved in 20AI of water, and was ligated employing T4 ligase in the similar manner as described in 3 for EMBODIMENT 1. 2 Transformation of Escherichia coli E. coli C600r m was transformed with the aforementioned plasmid DNA. The transformants showed the resistance against tetracycline having Åa concentration of 20 g ml and against ampicillin having a concentration of 30 units ml. A sequencial process tor determination of the molecular weight of the DNA s retained in the transformants, which was similar to that which has been described in 5 forEMBODIMENT 1, was applied to 10 independent colonies of the aformentioned transformants. The results showed the molecular weight of any of the plasmids was approximately 6 Plod. In this manner, a new chimeric plasmid whose cleavage map is shown by D in Fig. 1 B was synthesized from pHY780 whose cleavage map is shown by C in Fig. 1 A .This new chimeric plasmid was named pHY600. The results of the foregoing processes confirm that pHY600 can function ds a cloning vector at least for E. coli. EMBODIMENT 3 CHIMERIC PLASMID, pHY460 1 Cleavage of pHY600 and ligation of the cleaved fragment of pHY600 A process similar to that which has been described in 3 for EMBODIMENT 1 was employed to allow the restriction enzymes XhoI and SalI to cleave pHY600, the product ofEMBODIMENT 2, and to allow T4 ligase to ligate the cleavedDNA fragment thereof. A process similar to that which has been described in 4 for EMBODIMENT 1 was employed to transform E. coli with the ligated DNA and to produce a chimeric plasmid, which has d. molecular weight of approximately 4.6 Md. In this manner, a new chimeric plasmid whose cleavage map is shown by E in Fig. 1 B was synthesized from pHY600 whose cleavage map is shown by D in Fig. 1 B .This new chimeric plasmid was named pHY460. 2 Transformation of Bacillus subtilis i Preparation of competent cells B. subtilis Marburg 168 owned by Dr H. Saito, Research Institute for Applied Microorganisms, Tokyo University was cultivated on an L agar plate overnight. The cultivated microorganism was inoculated in medium I, that is Spizizen minimal medium a mixture containing 1.4 of K2HPO4, 0.6E of KH2PO41 0.2 of NH4 2S041 0.1 of sodium citrate, 0.02 of MgSO47H2O, O.5E of glucose, 0.02E of casein hydrolysate, 0.2 of yeast extract and 50fig ml of L tryptophane , and was cultivated on a shaker at 370C for approximately 4 hours until the cultivation reached the stationary phase. Medium II a medium similar to medium I except that.Lke concentration of L tryptophane and yeast extract are sfig ml and 0.02 respectively and 5 mM of MgSO4 is added was employed to decrease the concentration of the cultivated cells to 1 10, before the cultivation was continued.A 90 minute period was needed to allow the cells to be converted into competent ones. 0.9 ml of these competent cells were admixedwith 0.1 ml of the DNA solution of the chimeric plasmid pHY460 produced above in this EMBODIMENT and were cultivated on a shaker at 370C for 90 minutes. The abovementioned cultivation process allowed the competent cells to be transformed with the DNA to express the genetic information thereof. ii Detection of transformant The transformants retaining the plasmid DNA pHY460 were applied on an L agar plate containing tetracycline at 2Ofig ml, and were cultivated at 370C for 24 hours. A process similar to that which has been described in the description of EMBODIMENT 1 was applied to some of the colonies acquired above, in order to determine the dimension of a plasmid DNA retained in each transformant. As a result, the molecular weight of the chimeric plasmid produced by the aforementioned process was determined to be approxi mately 4.6 Md. E. coli C600r m was also determined to have been transformed, by means of a process similar to that described in 5 for EMBODIMENT 1. The foregoing description confirms that the chimeric plasmid pHY460 can function as a shuttle vector for a host vector system employing at least E. coli and B. subtilis. The transformed E. coli pHY460 and the trans formed B. subtilis pHY460 produced in this EMBODIMENT, were deposited at Fermentation Research Institute Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, and the former was given the deposition No. FERM BP 438 and the latter was given the deposition No. FERM BP 439. EMBODIMENT 4 CHIMERIC PLASMID, pHY360 A process similar to that which has been described in 3 for EMBODIMENT 1 was employed to allow the restriction enzymes SacII and BstEII to produce DNA fragments having a pair of cohesive ends b cleaving pHY460, the product ofEMBODIMENT 3, and the produced DNA fragments were digested with S1 nuclease to convert both the cohesive ends of each of the fragments into flush ends by nipping off a single stranded DNA chain protruding at each end of the same fragment, before the both flush ends were ligated byT4 ligase to produce a circular DNA. The abovementioned SI nuclease digestion was carried out by S1 nuclease having an activity of 50 units at 370C for 5 minutes in an S1 reaction buffer containing 30 mM of sodium acetate CpH 4.6 , 50 mM of Nazi, I mM of ZnSOq and 5 of glycerol. A process similar to that which has been described in 4 for EMBODIMENT 1 was employed to transform E. coli C600r m with the plasmid DNA pHY360 produced above, in order to produce a transformant having the resistance against tetracycline and ampicillin. A process similar to that which has been described in 5 for EMBODIMENT 1 was employed to determine the dimension of the plasmid DNA retained in the transformant produced above. The results showed that all the transformants had a molecular weight of approximately 3.6 Md. A process similar to that which has been described in 2 for EMBODIMENT 3 was employed to produce a variety of transformants of B. subtilis. In this manner, a new chimeric plasmid whose cleavage map is shown by F in Fig. 1 B was synthesized from pHY460 whose cleavage map is shown by E in Fig. 1 B .This new chimeric plasmid was named pHY360. The aforementioned aquisition of the transformant has proved that this pHY360 can function as a cloning vector a shuttle vector at least both for E. coli and for B. subtilis. The transformed E. coli pHY360 and the transformedB. subtilis pHY360 were deposited at Fermentation ResearchInstitute Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, and the former was given the deposition No. FERM BP 443 and the latter was given the deposition No. FERM BP 441. EMBODIMENT 5 CHIMERIC PLASMID, pHY310 A process similar to that which has been described in 3 for EMBODIMENT 1 was employed to allow the restriction enzymes AccI and BamHI to cleave pHY360, the product ofEMBODIMENT 4. The reaction mixture containing the cleaved DNA fragments was admixed with T4 DNA polymerase and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate to convert both the cohesive ends of each of the DNA fragments into flush ends by patching up the vacant sequence complementary to that of a single stranded DNA chain protruding at each end of the same fragment. Namely, the abovementioned reaction was carried out at 370C for 15 minutes in the mixture of T4 DNA polymerase having the activity of 1 unit, 25 L M M each of 4 kinds of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate and 20 m of a buffer having the pH value 8.0 and containing 67 mM of Tris HCI, 6.7 mM of MgCl2 and 6.7mM otss mercaptoethanol. A subsequent ligation process in which T4 ligase andHindIII linker dpCAAGCTTG produced by Takara Shuzo Co.,Ltd having Xn optical density of 0.01 OD were added, allowed the Hindili linker to bridge both the flush ends of the linear DNA fragment produced in the above process in order to produce a circular DNA. A process similar to that which has been described in 4 for EMBODIMENT I was employed to transform E. coli with the aforementioned ligated circular DNA. Produced by the process was a transformant having the resistance against tetracycline and ampicillin. Processes similar to those which have been described for 5 for EMBODIMENT 1 were employed to determine the molecular weight and the recognition and cleavage site for the bridging HindIII linker. The results showed that the approximate molecular weight of the plasmid DNA extracted from the transformant was 3.1 Md and that the same DNA can be cleaved by HindIll. In this manner, a new chimeric plasmid whose cleavage map is shown by F in Fig. 4 was synthesized from pHY360 whose cleavage map is shown by F in Fig. 4. This new chimeric plasmid was named pHY310. As in the cases of pHY460 and pHY3SO, this pHY310 was determined to have function to frequently transform also B. subtilis. The transformed E. coli pHY310 and the transformedB. subtilis pHY3i0 were deposited at FermentationResearch Institute Agency of Industrial Science andTechnology. The former was given the depositionNo. FERM BP 436 and the latter was given the depositionNo. FERM BP 437. EMBODIMENT 6 CHIMERIC PLASMID, pHY385 A process similar to that which has been described in 2 for EMBODIMENT 3 was employed to transform B. subtilis with pHY460. The transformants picked up from some of colonies were cultivated separately in L broth at 370C for 50 successive generations. As in the case of 2 forEMBODIMENT 3, the later cultivations were carried out on anL agar plate medium containing 20 agjml of tetracycline. A process similar to that which has been described in 5 for EMBODIMENT 1 proved that the colony which had been obtained by the above cultivation contained a plasmid DNA. As a result, the plasmid DNA s having a molecular weight of 3.85 Md were found in 4 colonies of transformants out of 36 colonies thereof. Further efforts were used to analyze the structure of this plasmid DNA. The results showed that this plasmid DNA was a new chimeric plasmid which had been produced from pHY460 by depriving the same plamidDNA of the DNA fragment, the approximate molecular weight of which was 0.75 Md. In this manner, a new chimeric plasmid whose cleavage map is shown by G in Fig. 1 B was synthesized from pHY460 whose cleavage map is shown by E in Fig. 1 B . This new chimeric plasmid was named pHY385. Processes similar to those which havebeen described in 4 and 5 for EMBODIMENT I proved that E. coli C600rm had been transformed with pHY385. This means that this pHY385 . can function as a cloning vector in the host vector system at least both for E. coli and forB. subtilis. The transformed E coli pHY385j and the transformedB. subtilis pHY385 were deposited at Fermentation ResearchInstitute Agency of Industrial Science and Technology. The former was given the deposition No. FERM BP 444 and the latter was given the deposition No. FERM BP 442. EMBODIMENT 7 CHIMERIC PLASMID, pHY340 A process similar to that which has been described in 3 for EMBODIMENT 1 was employed to allow the restriction enzyme HaeII to cleave pHY385, the product of EMBODIMENT 6, and to allow T4 ligase to ligate the cleaved DNA fragment. A process similar to that which has been described in 4 for EMBODIMENT I was employed to transform E. coli C600r m with the plasmid DNA pHY340 produced above, in order to produce a transformant having the resistance against tetracycline and ampicillin. A process similar to that which has been described in 5 for EMBODIMENT 1 was employed to determine the dimension of the plasmid DNA s retained in the transformants produced above. The results showed that all the transformants had the plasmid DNA, the approximate molecular weight of which was 3.4 Md. A process similar to that which has been described in 2 for EMBODIMENT 3 was employed to produce a variety of transformants of B. subtilis. In this manner, a new chimeric plasmid whose cleavage map is shown by G in Fig. 2 was synthesized from pHY385 whose cleavage map is shown by G in Fig. 2. This new chimeric plasmid was named pHY340. The aforementioned reciprocal transformation processes have proved that this pHY340 can function as a cloning vector a shuttle vector at least both for E. coli and for B. subtilis. The transformed E. coli pHY340 and the transformedB. subtilis pHY340 were deposited at Fermentation ResearchInstitute Agency of Industrial Science and Technology. The former was given the deposition No. FERM BP 445 and the latter was given the deposition No. FERM BP 446. EMBODIMENT 8 CHIMERIC PLASMID, pHY330 pHY460, the product of EMBODIMENT 3, was cleaved by the restriction enzyme XbaI. After being treated with S1 nuclease, the cleaved DNA fragments were ligated by T4 ligase to synthesize a chimeric plasmid. Namely, 0.5 g 50,kl of the plasmid DNA pHY460 was stored at 40C in buffer A for 4 months, nn order to allow each of the plasmidDNA s to incur nicks at random locations thereof and for the ultimate purpose of selectively producing a circular DNA having a desired dimension by ligating a variety of DNA fragments which were shortened in random length. The plasmid DNA s having nicks were cleaved by the restriction enzyme XbaI having an actlvity of 4 units dissolved in a buffer containing 10 mM of Tris HC1 CpH 7.6 , 7 mM of MgC12, 7 mM of ss mercaptoethanol and 50 mM of XaCl. The buffer containing the cleaved DNA fragments was admixed with NaC1 in the volume required to adjust the NaC1 concentration to100 rn and with cold ethanol in quantity twice as much as the foregoing concentration adjusted buffer, to be cooled at 200C. The DNA fragments were collected by 3 minute treatment at 40C at 15,000 rpm centrifugation, before being washed by cold ethanol.After ethanol was evaporated, the DNA fragments were dissolved in 50 fl of S1 buffer containing 30 mM of sodium acetate pH 4.6 , 50 mM of NaCl, 1 mM of ZnSO4 and 5 of glycerol in order to allow S1 nuclease to cleave each of the DNA fragments at nicks where it was selectively subjected to the digestion by S1 nuclease due to the single stranded structure thereof. The DNA fragments were subjected to reaction with 0,5VI of SI nuclease having an activity of 500 units 41 at 37 C for 5 minutes. This reaction mixture was admixed with 100 fl of phenol saturated with buffer A. After being agitated, the mixture was centrifuged at room temperature at 15,000 rpm for 3 minutes, to collect the upper layer containing the DNA fragments. The NaCl concentration of the solution taken out of the upper layer was adjusted to 100 mM. This solution was cooled at 20 C with 200 1 of 200C ethanol for 30 minutes, before being centrifuged at 40C at . 15,000 rpm for 3 minutes to collect the precipitate. After the precipitate was washed with cold ethanol, the ethanol was evaporated. The DNA precipitated at the bottom of the centrifuge tube was dissolved in 20 fl of water, before being admixed with 3 1 of 10 mM ATP, 3,41 of 100 mM dithiothreitol and 3 fl of 660 mM Tris HC1 pH 7.6 6.6 mM MgC12. T4 ligase having an activity of 10 units was allowed to ligate theDNA fragments at 150C. The ligated DNA was admixed with water of 170 l which is enough to make the volume 200 l. A process similar to that which has been described in 4 for EMBODIMENT 1 was employed to transform 100 fl of competent cells which had been produced by treating E. coli C600r m with CaC12, with 100 1 of the DNA solution. A process similar to that which has been described in 5 for EMBODIMENT 1 was employed to extract the retained plasmid DNA whose molecular weight is approximately 3.3 Md from the transformants. In this manner, a new chimeric plasmid whose cleavage map is shown by H in Fig. 3 was synthesized from pHY460 whose cleavage map is shown by E in Fig. 3. This new chimeric plasmid was named pHY330. Further, pHY330 has been proved to be a cloning vector useful at least for E. coli. EMBODIMENT 9 CHIMERLC PLASMID, pHY285 A process similar to that which has been described in 3 to 5 for EMBODIMENT 1 was employed to cleave pHY330, the product of EMBODIMENT 8, employing a mixture containing the restriction enzyme HaeII in a buffer containing 10 mM of Tris HC1 CpH 7.6 , 7 mM of MgC12 and 7 mM of ss mercapto ethanol, ligate the cleaved DNA fragments produced above and transform E. coli with the ligated DNA produced above, in order to produce a circular DNA whose approximate molecular weight is 2.85 MD. In this manner, a new chimeric plasmid whose cleavage map is shown by I in Fig. 3 was synthesized from pHY330 whose cleavage map is shown by H in Fig. 3. This new chimeric plasmid was named pHY285. Further, pHY285 was proved to be a cloning vector useful at least for E. coli. EMBODIMENT 10 CHIMERIC PLASMID, pHY225 The restriction enzymes SacII and EcoRI were allowed to cleave pHY285, the product of EMBODIMENT 9. As in the case of EMBODIMENTS 4 and 8, the cleaved DNA fragments were digested with S1 nuclease to convert b6th the cohesive ends of each of the fragments into flush ends by nipping off a single stranded DNA chain protruding at each end of the same fragment, before both the flush ends were ligated byT4 ligase to produce a circular DNA.Namely, 0.4,ffg 50 f1 of the DNA pHY285 was cleaved by SacII having an activity of 4 units dissolved in a buffer containing 10 mM of Tris HC1 DH 7.6 , 7mM of wC12 and 7 mM of mercaptoethanol. The cleavage process was carried out at 370C for 60 minutes, before the mixture was heated at 60 0C for 10 minutes to terminate the reaction. The reaction mixture in which the DNA s were dissolved was admixed with NaC1 in the amount required to bring the concentration thereof to 40 mM, before being admixed withEcoRI having an activity of 4 units, allowing the DNA s to be subjected to reaction at 370C for 60 minutes.After being heated at 60 C for 10 minutes, the reaction mixture was admixed with 50 fl of water. This mixture was admixed with phenol saturated with bufferA and shaken, before being centrifuged at room temperature at 15,000 rpm for 30 minutes. The upper layer containing the DNA s which was separated from the mixture in the abovementioned centrifugation, was admixed w. th Na Cl i n the amount equi red to adjust the Na C1 concentration to 100 mM, before being treated with cold ethanol. After the ethanol was evaporated, the DNA s were treated with S1 nuclease at 370C for 5 minutes. A process similar to that which has been described in 3j to 5 for EMBODIMENT 1 was employed to ligate the above producedDNA fragment and to transform E. coli with the DNA, to produce a new chimeric plasmid whose approximate molecular weight is 2.25 Md. In the aforementioned processes, a new chimeric plasmid was synthesized from pHY285 whose cleavage map is shown by J in Fig. 3. This new chimeric plasmid was named pHY225. Further, pHY225 was proved to be a cloning vector at least for E. coli.
