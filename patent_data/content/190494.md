# Circuit arrangement for use in an integrated circuit having built in self test design.

## Abstract
A circuit arrangement for use in an integrated circuit having a built in self test design, the circuit arrangement comprising first and second gates 8, 3 coupled to a flip flop 2 via a third gate 4 . The present invention provides a multiplexer M coupled to one input of the first gate 8 , the multiplexer M being controllable by a control signal to feed either input data or output data of the circuit arrangement to said one input of the first gate 8 and a fourth gate 13 coupled to an input of the second gate 3 , the fourth gate 13 having an input connected to receive a signal dependent on the control signal to the data selector means M .
