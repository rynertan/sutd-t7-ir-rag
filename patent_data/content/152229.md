In accordance with the present invention, a compound is provided having the formula R C CH₂O ₃C X wherein R and X are each organic substituents as defined above at the 4 and 1 positions respectively in the compound. It has been shown that this class of compounds includes a number of chemicals which exhibit significant pesticidal activity. Tables 1 and 2, to which further reference is made later, show the relative effectiveness for control of houseflies and American cockroaches of a number of compounds of the general formula set forth above, both alone and with the synergist piperonyl butoxide PB . The abbreviations used are as follows Pr propyl, Bu butyl, Pen pentyl, Hex hexyl, Hept heptyl, Ph phenyl, The pesticides of the present invention exhibit a pesticidal activity, as LD₅₀ in micrograms of the pesticide per gram of body weight of a selected pest, of no more than about 400. For example, such an activity has been shown as an insecticide against The use of synergists with pesticides is well known and is discussed in detail in the publication Mixed Function Oxidase Involvement in the Biochemistry of Insecticide Synergists , J. E. Casida, The compositions of the present invention may be used in combination with an inert carrier that serves as a diluent or vehicle for the active pesticides. For example, the toxicant may be dissolved in petroleum hydrocarbons, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, cellosolves or any other suitable inert carrier prior to use. Alternatively, the toxicant may be adsorbed on a solid inert carrier such as talc, clay, finely ground silica or the like. Contacting of pests with the pesticides of the present invention can be by any effective and convenient method, including any of the various methods of contacting well known in the art and used for delivering prior art pesticides to insects or other pests. For example, the pesticide may be utilized as a spray, an aerosol, dust or granules, or may be impregnated into or coated onto a structure with which the insect or other pests may come into contact, may be mixed with or impregnated into bait, may be incorporated with a substance or structure which slowly releases it in an area normally frequented by the pest or may be incorporated with and or into other formulations which are directed into contact with the pest or placed where the pest will be likely to contact such formulations. The pesticides may be mixed with an inert carrier to facilitate delivery of the pesticides to the pests. The toxicity to houseflies is dependent on both the R and X substituents as shown in Table 1 giving the first definitive evidence of effectiveness and further refined evaluations. The 1,4 The toxicity to American cockroaches of topically applied 1,4 The above data indicate that compounds of the formula R C CH₂O ₃C X are often effective pesticides. R or X may be alkyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl, each of which may be normal, branched or substituted, or may be aryl or substituted aryl. When R is a normal or branched alkyl, a cycloalkyl or aryl, useful compounds result. Preferably, the number of carbon atoms in R is three to ten. More preferably R is Methods for making compounds of the general formula set out above can be found in the following publications Structure Toxicity Relationships of 1 Substituted 4 alkyl 2,6,7 trioxabicyclo 2.2.2 octanes, D.S. Milbrath, J.L. Engel, J.G. Verkade and J.E. Casida, Intermediates for these reactions are described by Ketene Acetals. XXXIV. Tetra and Pentamethylene Ketene Acetals, S.M. McElvain and R.E.

Abbreviations used in nmr data are s singlet, d doublet, 2xd two doublets, dd doublet of doublets, t triplet, 2xt two triplets, q quartet and m multiplet. where R may be alkyl or aryl, preferably methyl or ethyl. For example, a mixture of 2 Intermediate trimethyl orthocarboxylates were commercially available or were synthesized by either of two procedures illustrated with the methyl esters. In the first procedure, the appropriate benzotrichloride or benzotribromide from bromination of the corresponding toluene with wherein Y represents hydrogen or one or more other groups such as halo or trifluoromethyl. In the second procedure, the appropriate nitrile was treated with methanol and hydrochloric acid to obtain the imino ester hydrochloride and ultimately the trimethyl orthocarboxylate McElvain and Starn, 1955 . This procedure was as follows For example, 4 nitrobenzoyl chloride 2.28g, 12.3mmol in dry dichloromethane 4ml was added to 3 isopropyl 3 hydroxymethyloxetane 1.6g, 12.3mmol in dry dichloromethane 15ml and dry pyridine 2ml at 0 C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solution was stirred overnight, then extracted with water, dried sodium sulfate , filtered and evaporated to leave the 4 nitrobenzoyl ester 3.kg, 99 as a residue which was not purified farther. ¹H NMR CDCl₃ , δ1.0 6H, d, CH₃ ₂C , 2.3 1H, m, C CH , 4.55 2H, s, CH₂OCO , 4.6 4H, dd, CH₂OCH₂ , 8.3 4H, q, aromatic . This residue was dissolved in dry dichloromethane 15ml under a nitrogen atmosphere, cooled to 55 C and boron trifluoride etherate 2ml was added. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and was then quenched with triethylamine, evaporated to dryness and partitioned between dichloromethane and water. The organic layer was separated, dried potassium carbonate and evaporated. The residue was purified by passage through a short basic alumina column to afford trioxabicyclooctane The compounds listed in Table 1 were tested for insecticidal activity by dissolving them in acetone or in tetrahydrofuran if they were insoluble in acetone. Subsequent dilutions were prepared using the same solvent. The compound solutions 0.5 microliter were applied topically to the ventrum of the abdomen of anesthetized adult female houseflies Table 1 gives the structure activity relationships for the test compounds on houseflies and on houseflies pre treated with PB. Many of the compounds are active in the same potency range in this test as current commercial pesticides. Significant insecticidal activity against the common housefly was found with suitable combinations of the following R and X substituents Other X or R substituents which may confer activity are substituted cycloalkanes or cycloalkenes of 5 to 10 carbon atoms. R may also confer activity when it is a substituted phenyl group. It is preferred that R is not phenyl when X is phenyl or 4 fluorophenyl. Compounds having pesticidal activity include those wherein R is a normal or branched propyl or butyl, or phenyl or cycloalkyl having 3 to 10 carbon atoms and X is cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl having 6 to 10 carbon atoms, or substituted phenyl. Another group of compounds with pesticidal activity are those where R is normal or branched propyl or butyl, phenyl or cycloalkyl having 5 or 6 carbon atoms and X is cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclohexenyl, ethynyl, or phenyl substituted by halo, cyano, azido, nitro or C₁ ₂ alkyl, the said C₁ ₂ alkyl being substituted by 1 to 3 halogen atoms. Yet another group of active compounds are those wherein R is Compounds which have been prepared and tested for insecticidal activity and which exhibit very high activity generally an LD₅₀ of less than or equal to about 5.5µg g when used along with PB include those wherein On a more general basis, R and X can be substantially any organic substituents, so long as the required activity is found. To date, activity has been found where R and X are n alkyl, branched alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, phenyl, or substituted phenyl substituents. While not all compounds with these substituents are active, many suitable combinations exist. Furthermore, simple tests as set out above with houseflies, or similar tests run with any desired pest, quickly determine which combinations are suitable for use against any particular pest. The compounds listed in Table 2 were tested for toxicity to adult male American cockroaches Other synergists known to serve as inhibitors of oxidative detoxification can be used in place of PB. This has been confirmed with tests on houseflies with the compound wherein R is The mammalian toxicities of two of the compounds of the present invention were determined by individually dissolving each compound in olive oil and administering each resulting solution intraperitoneally to mice for determination of the mortality 24 hours later. The compounds were R is As is apparent, some compounds of the present invention have relatively low mammalian toxicity, specifically an injected LD₅₀ of greater than 200 milligrams of compound per kilogram of body weight. The mammalian toxicity may vary significantly depending upon the solvent carriers, routes of administration and species of mammal. The compounds of the present invention show significant activity as pesticides against widely different types of insects. The compounds biodegrade readily.
