# Water timer.

## Abstract
A water timer 10 including a housing 12 having an inlet 14 and outlet 16 through which water flows to drive an impeller 20 and speed reducer 22 used to determine the open time of a valve member 18 . The valve member 18 is movable in one direction, corresponding with one direction of axial movement of the timer dial 26 , into a water flow posi tion out of engagement with a valve seat 50 and movable in an opposite direction, corresponding with an opposite direc tion of axial movement of the dial 26 , into engagement with the valve seat 50 into a water shut off position. A biasing arrangement 30 including the relative sizes of first and second pressure responsive surface areas 72,75 of the valve member 18 functions to bias the same into its water shut off position when the dial 26 is in its water shut off position and a source of water under pressure is communicated with the inlet 14 . The biasing arrangement 30 is changed in re sponse to the axial movement of the dial 26 in the one direction into its water flow position, the change being suffi cient to bias the valve member 18 from its water shut off to its water flow position.
