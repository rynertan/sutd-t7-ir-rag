## Description
The present invention relates to a process for purifying a polyalkylene ether by separating and recovering a heteropoly acid and or its salt from a polyalkylene ether or a mixture of a polyalkylene ether with an organic solvent containing a heteropoly acid and or its salt. The present invention provides a process for purifying a polyalkylene ether by separating and recovering heteropoly acids dissolved from a polymerizing solution containing as main components a polyalkylene ether and an unreacted monomer obtained by a polymerization with heteropoly acids as a catalyst. Polyalkylene ethers are recently highlighted as the starting material for Spandex, polyurethane elastomers, polyester elastomers, etc., their amounts used are simply increasing and various improvements have been attempted in a production process and a purification process. Among them, there is recently reported a process for synthesis of a polyalkylene ether by polymerization of a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran hereinafter abbreviated as THF with the use of a heteropoly acid as the catalyst EP A 126 471. According to this process, after the reaction, most of the catalyst can be easily recovered from the polymerizing solution by way of phase separation, and yet the process has the advantage of being capable of using the catalyst in recycle. However, since the catalyst is partially dissolved in the polymerizing solution, in order to obtain a high purity polymer and lower the production cost of a polymer, it is required to perform the operations for separation and recovery of the catalyst dissolved in the polymerizing solution. Ordinarily, for removal of the acid catalyst in the polymer, there is employed a method such as extraction with water, or filtration or washing out the salt formed with addition of a basic substance. However, there is a strong interaction between a polyalkylene ether and a heteropoly acid, and hence an extraction with water cannot remove the catalyst efficiently but requires a large amount of water. Further, a polyalkylene ether will readily form an emulsion with water, whereby the problem is caused that phase separation can be effected with difficulty. Also, when a neutralization reaction is carried out, an expensive heteropoly acid becomes no longer available for reuse to result disadvantageously in increased cost for a production of the polymer. Further, even when washing with water or a neutralization with a basic substance may be performed, it is very difficult to reduce the heteropoly acid content to 0.1 wt or less, particularly 0.01 wt. or less based on a polyalkylene ether. In the light of the state of the art as described above, the present inventors have made intensive studies about a process for removing efficiently a heteropoly acid in a polyalkylene ether, and consequently found a phenomenon that the heteropoly acid is precipitated in case of a liquid mixture of the polyalkylene ether and the heteropoly acid , or the heteropoly acid alone remains as a solid phase in case of a solid mixture of the polyalkylene ether and the heteropoly acid when a specific solvent for purification is added to the polyalkylene ether containing the stated impurity. And, further, various methods for effectively removing the heteropoly acid remaining minutely in a polyalkylene ether even after the above treatment have also been investigated. As a consequence, it has been found that, by treatment with the use of an adsorbent in co presence of a specific solvent for purification, heteropoly acids can be removed to a very low concentration. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of such findings. The present invention provides a process for purifying a polyalkylene ether, which comprises mixing a polyalkylene ether or a mixture of an organic solvent and a polyalkylene ether containing a heteropoly acid and or its salt hereinafter sometimes abbreviated as heteropoly acids with at least one solvent for purification selected from hydrocarbons having 3 to 15 carbon atoms or halogenated hydrocarbons having 1 to 15 carbon atoms hereinafter sometimes abbreviated as a solvent for purification to precipitate the heteropolyacid and or its salt and separating the phase composed mainly of the heteropoly acid and or its salt, and, if desired, thereafter bringing the polyalkylene ether or the mixture of an organic solvent and a polyalkylene ether containing heteropoly acids into contact with a solid adsorbent capable or adsorbing the heteropolyacids in the presence of the above described solvent for purification to strengthen the adsorbing action of the adsorbent for the heteropolyacid and or its salt. The heteropoly acid and its salt in the present invention refers comprehensively to oxy acids formed by condensation of at least one oxide of Mo, W and V with oxy acids of other elements such as P, Si, As, Ge, B, Ti, Ce, Co, etc. and salts of the oxy acids, the atomic ratio of the former to the latter being 2.5 to 12.

Among them, preferable examples include 12 molybdophosphoric acid, 18 molybdo 2 phosphoric acid, 9 molybdophosphoric acid, 12 tungstophosphoric acid, 18 tungsto 2 phosphoric acid, 11 molybdo 1 vanadophosphoric acid, 12 molybdotungstophosphoric acid, 6 molybdo 6 tungstophosphoric acid, 12 molybdotungstovanadophosporic acid, 12 tungstovanadophosphoric acid, 12 molybdosilicic acid, 12 tungstosilicic acid, 12 molybdotunstosilicic acid, 12 molybdotungstovanadosilicic acid, 12 tungstoboric acid, 12 molybdoboric acid, 12 molybdotungstoboric acid, 12 molybdovanadoboric acid, 12 molybdotungstovanadoboric acid, 12 tungstogermanic acid and 12 tungstoarsenic acid. The kinds of the salts are not particularly limited. For example, there may be employed metal salts of the metals belonging to the group I of the periodic table such as Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Cu, Ag, Au, etc., of the group II such as Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn, Cd, Hg etc., of the group III such as Sc, La, Ce, Al, Ga, In, etc., of the group VIII such as Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Pd, Pt, etc. and other metals such as Sn, Pb, Mn, Bi, etc., or ammonium salts, amine salts and others. Typical examples of these salts may include 12 tungstophosphate 1 lithium LiH₂PW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstophosphate 2 lithium Li₂HPW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstophosphate 1 sodium NaH₂PW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstophosphate 2 sodium Na₂HPW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstophosphate 2 potassium K₂HPW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstophosphate 2 cesium Cs₂HPW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstophosphate 2 silver Ag₂HPW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstophosphate 1 magnesium MgHPW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstophosphate 1 calcium CaHPW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstophosphate 1 zinc ZnHPW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstophosphate 1 nickel NiHPW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstosilicate 1 nickel NiH₂SiW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstosilicate 2 lithium Li₂H₂SiW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstosilicate 2 silver Ag₂H₂SiW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstosilicate 1 magnesium MgH₂SiW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstosilicate 1 aluminum AlHSiW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstosilicate 1 indium InHSiW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstosilicate 1 gallium GaHSiW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 molybdophosphate 1 lithium LiH₂PMo₁₂O₄₀ , 12 molybdophosphate 1 magnesium MgHPMo₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstophosphate 2 ammonium NH₄ ₂HPW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstosilicate 1 tetramethylamine N CH₃ ₄H₃SiW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstophosphate 1 iron FePW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstophosphate 1 bismuth BiPW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstophosphate 1 aluminum AlPW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstophosphate 1 chromium CrPW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstophosphate 1 gallium GaPW₁₂O₄₀ , 12 tungstophosphate 1 indium InPW₁₂O₄₀ and the like. The heteropoly acid and or its salt may be either a single compound or a mixture of two or more kinds. The amount of the heteropoly acids to be dissolved may preferably 0.001 by weight to 50 by weight, more preferably 0.001 by weight to 10 by weight, based on the polyalkylene ether or the mixture of the polyalkylene ether and the organic solvent. The polyalkylene ether in the present invention is a polymer having polyoxyalkylene chains of the formula The organic solvent mixed with the polyalkylene ether is not particularly limited, but it is possible to exemplify cyclic ethers, polyhydric alcohols which are the monomers constituting the polyalkylene ether or alcohols generally employed as polymerization terminators. Also, water may be contained in a small amount. The polymerization mixture obtained by the reaction of THF alone or THF with a cyclic ether, THF with a polyhydric alcohol or THF with a cyclic ether and a polyhydric alcohol with the use of heteropoly acids as polymerization catalysts is a suitable example, and the fact that the polymerization as described above proceeds is disclosed in the above identified patent application and in EP A 158 229. The polymerization mixture obtained by the above polymerization reaction is frequently separated into two phases comprising the phase composed mainly of the polymer and the unreacted monomer and the phase composed mainly of the heteropoly acid catalyst and, in this case, the present process may be applied to the polymerization mixture from which the catalyst phase has been previously removed. The reaction mixture in the above applications contains generally 0.1 to 3 by weight of heteropoly acids dissolved therein. Examples of hydrocarbons having 3 to 15 carbon atoms or halogenated hydrocarbons having 1 to 15 carbon atoms to be used for the precipitation of heteropoly acids solvents for purification are cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane, cyclooctane, methylcyclo pentane, methylcyclohexane, chlorocyclohexane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, undecane, dodecane, chloroform, trichlorotrifluoroethane, trichlorofluoromethane, benzene, toluene, chlorobenzene, and the like. Propane, butane, etc. are required to be handled under pressurization. Particularly preferred are pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, undecane, dodecane, cyclohexane, cyclopentane, cyclooctane, cyclononane and cyclodecane, since they have a higher performance of precipitating heteropoly acids effectively even in small amounts. When the present process is to be applied to a reaction mixture comprising a polyalkylene ether and unreacted THF, for recovery of the unreacted THF from a solvent for purification added, the solvent for purification should preferably have a boiling point higher than THF and not form an azeotropic mixture therewith. Although n hexane has been known to form an azeotropic mixture with THF, n heptane, octane and nonane are found in the present invention to form no azeotropic mixture with THF. Further, since these solvents can be rather easily recovered from the mixture with polyalkylene ether, n heptane, octane and nonane are particularly preferred as the solvent. A solvent having 16 or more carbon atoms is not preferred, because it has a high boiling point and can be recovered by separation from a polyalkylene ether with difficulty. Even when no azeotropic mixture will be formed, a solvent having not more than 7 carbon atoms requires a large number of necessary stages of a rectifying tower, and, although depending on the amount of the hydrocarbon employed, the liquid within or at the bottom of the rectifying tower sometimes separates into two phases, that is, the polyalkylene ether phase and the hydrocarbon phase. When the separation into two phases occurs within the rectifying tower, the stage efficiency is decreased and also undesirable foaming will readily occur. When using octane or nonane, two phase separation within the rectifying tower will hardly occur and therefore octane and nonane are most preferred as the solvent. The details about the function of precipitating heteropoly acids are not clear, but it may be estimated that low solubility of heteropoly acids in the above described solvent for purification and an appropriate compatibility of the solvent for purification with a polyalkylene ether are each one of causes therefor. The amount of the solvent for purification to be used for precipitation of heteropoly acids depends on the coexisting amounts of organic solvents such as unreacted monomers, but may generally be at least equal to, preferably two fold or more of the weight of organic solvents such as unreacted monomers. Also, it is added in an amount generally of 0.5 fold or more, preferably 1.0 fold or more, relative to the polyalkylene ether. When the content of the organic solvents such as unreacted monomers is small, the solvent for purification added may sometimes cause a phase separation from the polyalkylene ether phase, but the effect is small even if the solvent for purification may be used in an amount over the amount which will cause a phase separation. When organic solvents such as unreacted monomers coexist in large amounts, a large amount of the solvent for purification is required to be used for precipitation of heteropoly acids. For this reason, it is preferable to recover at least a portion of the organic solvent by concentrating the mixture to a content of organic solvents of 90 wt. or less, more preferably. 50 wt. or less, before adding the solvent for purification to precipitate heteropoly acids. For mixing of the solvent for purification, a conventional stirring means, a static mixer, etc. may be used. After mixing, the mixture may be left to stand, whereby the phase consisting mainly of heteropoly acid or its salt is precipitated to form two phases together with the polymer solution phase. In the phase consisting mainly of heteropoly acids as the lower phase, a small amount of polymer and organic solvents such as unreacted monomers and a very minute amount of the solvent for purification are contained, although the amounts may differ more or less depending on the practicing conditions. Mixing and standing may be carried out at a temperature at which the operation can easily be done within the range which will not coagulate the polymer. If the temperature is too high, the solubility of the heteropoly acid is increased and therefore no higher temperature than necessary should be used. Generally, the operations are practiced at 25 to 60 When the upper phase consists mainly of a polyalkylene ether, THF and a hydrocarbon solvent for purification which has a higher boiling point than THF and does not form an azeotropic mixture therewith, although somewhat different depending on the amount of the solvent for purification, only THF can be recovered from the rectifying tower and the remaining mixture can be separated by cooling at an appropriate temperature into two phases of the phase consisting mainly of the polyalkylene ether and the phase consisting mainly of the solvent for purification, whereby most of the solvent for purification can be recovered by phase separation. The solvent recovered can be used as such, or after a purification operation such as distillation, again as the solvent for separating the phase composed mainly of the heteropoly acid and or its salt. By practicing the above described process of the present invention, heteropoly acids can be removed and recovered efficiently in a form which can be reused, and the heteropoly acid concentration in the polyalkylene ether can be reduced to 0.5 wt. or less, even 0.01 wt. or less under optimum practicing conditions. Polyalkylene ether having reduced or low concentration of heteropoly acids of 0.5 wt. or less, respectively with or without practice of the above described operation, may further be purified to lower the heteropoly acid concentration, by the step of contacting with a solid adsorbent in the co presence of at least one solvent selected from hydrocarbons having 3 to 15 carbon atoms or halogenated hydrocarbons having 1 to 15 carbon atoms a solvent for purification . The solvent for purification to be co present may be the same as that used for separating the phase composed mainly of heteropoly acids. Usually, the solvent for purification is added to a polymerizing solution comprising the polyalkylene ether, unreacted monomers and heteropoly acids to separate the phase consisting mainly of heteropoly acids, followed by contact with the solid adsorbent. When the concentration of the dissolved heteropoly acid is low or when the amount of the solvent for purification added is small, the phase consisting of heteropoly acids may sometimes not be separated and, in this case, only the operation of contacting the polymerizing solution with the solid adsorbent is practiced. The amount of the hydrocarbon or the halogenated hydrocarbon a solvent for purification to be co present when contacting with the solid adsorbent may be preferably 0.05 fold or more, more preferably 0.5 fold or more of the polyalkylene ether. When an organic solvent such as THF is admixed, it is preferable to add a solvent for purification in an amount at least equal to the amount of the organic solvent. When a polyalkylene ether alone or a small amount of the organic solvent is mixed, the solvent for purification may be phase separated from the polyalkylene ether phase, but the effect is small even if the solvent for purification may be used in an amount to such an extent to cause the phase separation. On the other hand, when the solvent for purification is previously admixed in a suitable amount, it is not particularly required to be added, but it may also be added, if desired. The kind of the solid adsorbent is not particularly limited, provided that it can adsorb the heteropoly acid and or its salt, but preferred examples are one or a mixture of two or more selected from A activated charcoal, B aluminum oxides such as alumina, silica alumina, etc., C oxides, hydroxides or carbonates of magnesium, calcium and rare earth metals and D basic ion exchange resins. The activated charcoal used is not particularly limited but may be any of coconut shell type, coal type, petroleum type, charcoal type. Also, as for a basic ion exchange resin, it is not particularly limited but may preferably be of microporous type. Among them, activated charcoal, alumina and silica alumina have the advantages of high adsorption ability and being hardly crushable in the case of treatment when the adsorbent is packed in a column. Among solid basic compounds as described above in C , CaO, Ca OH ₂ and CaCO₃ are preferably cheap, but MgO has the advantage of low solubility. A basic ion exchange resin is lower in adsorption ability as compared with other adsorbents, is required to be used in a large amount and therefore has the drawback that the impurities from the resin may be dissolved out. The amount of the adsorbent to be used, which may differ depending on the amount of heteropoly acids dissolved, may be 2 to 5000 fold weight, more preferably 10 to 1000 fold weight of the amount of heteropoly acids dissolved. As the amount used is larger, the concentration of heteropoly acids after treatment will be lowered. The treatment temperature is not particularly limited, but a temperature for an easy operation within the temperature range in which the liquid to be treated has an appropriate viscosity is selected. For example, for polyoxytetramethylene glycol or a copolymer of polyalkylene ether glycol of THF with other cyclic ethers or THF with diols, the temperature may be 20 to 150 As the treatment method, there may be employed any of the conventional methods such as the method in which after mixing and stirring the liquid to be treated with adsorbent powder or particles, the adsorbent is separated by filtration, and the method in which the liquid to be treated is passed through a column packed with the adsorbent, and the method may be either batchwise or continuous. The treatment time, which is not particularly limited, may generally be 0.05 to 10 hours, particularly 0.1 to 3 hours. The adsorbent used can be utilized, as long as it has the adsorption capacity, as such or after a regeneration treatment. After the adsorption treatment, the organic solvent and the solvent for purification co existing can be evaporated by a distillation at normal or reduced pressure to provide a polyalkylene ether lowered in a concentration of heteropoly acids. According to the present invention, the concentration of heteropolyacids can be lowered to 0.0001 wt. or less. Besides, since a dissolution of impurities out of the adsorbent can also be suppressed, by removing the solvent by a distillation, etc. after the adsorption treatment, a polyalkylene ether extremely small in impurities can be obtained. Such effects may be considered to be attributable by the co operating action of the above solvent for purification and the adsorbent selected. More specifically, it may be estimated that, through the presence of the solvent for purification, the affinity of the heteropoly acid for a polyalkylene ether is lowered to strengthen the adsorbing action of the adsorbent for the heteropoly acid or its salt, simultaneously with a suppression of a dissolution of the components out of the adsorbent itself. The solvent for purification may also be considered to promote a diffusion of the heteropoly acid toward the surface of adsorbent. By a practice of the present invention, as already mentioned above, the heteropoly acid and or its salt dissolved in the polyalkylene ether or the mixture of the polyalkylene ether with the organic solvent can be removed efficiently in the form which can be reused. Further after the treatment with an adsorbent, the concentration of heteropoly acids in the polyalkylene ether can be reduced to 0.0001 wt. or lower. After applying the treatment with the adsorbent according to the present process, unreacted monomers such as THF can be recovered by a distillation, whereby scale formation within the distillation tower can be suppressed. Further, the polyalkylene glycol treated according to the present process suffers little from deterioration even when heat is applied and therefore can be distilled by means of a thin film type molecular distillation apparatus at 100 to 180 Into a 5.0 liter vessel equipped with a stirring means and a reflux condenser were charged 2.0 kg of THF containing 300 ppm of water and 1.0 kg of 12 tungstophosphoric acid H₃PW₁₂O₄₀ 3H₂O controlled to the number of crystal water of 3 by heating in an electric furnace at 150 In this Example and in the following Examples, a microanalysis of the heteropoly acid or its salt was conducted by analysis of W, Mo, etc. according to the fluorescent X ray analytical method. It is not clear whether W or Mo remaining minutely in the polyalkylene ether after the adsorption treatment still remains the structure of the original heteropoly acid. When THF was evaporated by reduced pressure distillation from the THF solution containing 6 by weight of 12 tungsto phosphoric acid and 50 by weight of PTMG obtained in the same manner as Example 1, no precipitation of the catalyst phase occurred at all, but the existing 12 tungstophosphoric acid was all dissolved in PTMG to give PTMG containing 12 by weight of 12 tungsto phosphoric acid. Various solvents as indicted in Table 1 were added to the polymers containing the heteropoly acid or the salt thereof or mixtures containing the said polymers and THF as indicated in Table 1, followed by stirring, and they were left to stand at 30 To a mixture comprising about 390 g of PTMG, about 200 g of THF, about 1.0 kg of n octane and 12 tungstophosphoric acid minutely dissolved therein obtained after the catalyst separation following the operation as described in Example 1, 1.0 g of MgO powder was added, followed by stirring at 40 When a mixture comprising 390 g of PTMG, 200 g of THF and 50 ppm of 12 tungstophosphoric acid was treated in the same manner as described in Example 15, a PTMG with a W content of 20 ppm was obtained. Further, PTMG was partially depolymerized and lowered in recovery. Into the compositions as indicated in Table 2, comprising 100 g of a polyalkylene ether and hydrocarbon solvents containing minute amounts of heteropoly acids, predetermined amounts of adsorbents as indicated in Table 2 were added, followed by stirring at 80 Into a vessel equipped with a stirring means and a reflux condenser were charged 2.0 kg of THF and 85 g of ethylene glycol. Then, 1.0 kg of 12 tungstosilicic acid H₄SiW₁₂O₄₀ heated at 320
