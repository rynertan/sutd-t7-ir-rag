# A method involving a one stage prothrombin time test for determining a blood clotting mechanism.

## Abstract
A one stage prothrombin assay which measures the exponential rate of thrombin production in thromboplastin treated, recalcified plasma. A serum reagent reduces the lag time before thrombin production substantially to zero for both normal and abnormal plasma, thus allowing meas urements to be made in just a few minutes.
