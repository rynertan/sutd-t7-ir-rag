# A gear assembly adapted for mating with a third gear without backlash.

## Abstract
A gear assembly comprising two gears 10, 12 and a spring 14 in the form of a C shaped clip for applying a resilient force between the gears. Two pins 24, 28 are pro vided on the respective side surfaces of the gears to receive the spring which has concave end surfaces to be received by the pins. Each of the concave end surfaces 30 is defined by a part of a circle having a center which lies on a line of action of force by the pins.
