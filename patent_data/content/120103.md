## Description
CIRCUIT FOR PREVENTING TWO OR MORE AC SWITCHES FROM CONDUCTING SIMULTANEOUSLY The present invention relates to a circuit for preventing two or more AC switches from turning on simultaneously in a circuitry including a plurality of AC switches. AC switches such as reverse blocking triode thyristors SCR and bidirectional triode thyristors Triac, trademark have heretofore been prevented from conducting simutaneously by controlling them by means of a gate signal. However, if the load contains a reactor component or a capacitor component, this method using a gate signal synchronized with the frequency of input voltage or generated on zero crossing of input voltage to turn on the AC switches has a problem that two or more AC switches can conduct simultaneously because the load current is not in phase with the input voltage.Synchronizing the gate signal with the frequency of the input voltage is to avoid noise upon firing of the AC switch. In order to solve the above mentioned problem, a circuit as shown in Fig. 1 has been proposed in which a load 1 and a Triac 2 are connected in series with an AC power supply 3 and resistors 40 and 50 connected in series with each other are connected in parallel with the Triac 2. The alternating voltage v across the resistor 50 is detected and, if it is practically zero, the Triac 2 is judged to be on or conducting. However, when the applied voltage is zero, the circuit will detect zero voltage, thus indicating as if the Triac is on even although it is actually off. Another disadvantage of this circuit is that the resistances for the resistors 40, 50 have to be selected suitably according to the voltage applied. A further problem is that as the applied voltage increases, the electronic parts or devices used in the detection circuit have to have a larger withstand voltage and, therefore, become expensive. A still further problem is that when the current through the Triac 2 is large, the voltage between terminals T1, T2 will be so high that the circuit will indicate as if the Triac is on. An object of the present invention is to provide a circuit for the above mentioned purpose which obviates such shortcomings. In accordance with the present invention, a reliable detection of the turning on of an AC switch is possible by detecting the voltage across the control terminals of theAC switch, and the firing detection circuit is not affected by the voltage applied to or the current through the AC switch. According to the present invention there is provided a circuit for preventing two or more AC switches from conducting simultaneously, said circuit comprising for each of saidAC switches a control circuit for giving its respective AC switch a control signal to turn it on, and a detection circuit for detecting the voltage across the control terminals of said respective AC switch to detect that it is on, said control circuit being provided with a circuit for cancelling the control signals for the other AC switches when one of said detection circuits has detected that the respective AC switch is on. Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description taken with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram showing a conventional circuit Fig. 2 is a circuit diagram showing the working principle of the circuit according to the present invention and Fig. 3 is a circuit diagram of an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 2, a load 1 and a Triac 2 as an AC switch are connected in series with an AC power supply 3.Across a terminal T1 and a gate G of the Triac 2, a firing circuit 4 for giving it a gate voltage is connected. The firing circuit has a transistor 6 and resistors 5, 7, 8 and 9. The transistor receives a firing command signal through the resistor 5. When a firing command signal is given to its base B, the transistor 6 will turn on and a voltage appear across the terminal T1 and the gate G. Thus the Triac 2 will turn on. Also, a firing detection circuit 10 for detecting the gate voltage is connected across the terminal T1 and the gate G of the Triac 2. The firing detection circuit 10 includes a comparison circuit 11 for comparing the gate voltage with a reference voltage. When the gate voltage is higher than the reference voltage, the comparison circuit 11 gives a high level signal, indicating that the Triac 2 is on. The firing detection circuit 10 generates a high level signal while the gate voltage is being applied by the firing circuit 4 to between the terminal T1 and the gate G of the Triac 2. Even while no gate voltage is being applied, it generates a high level signal if the Triac is on, because then there is a voltage between the gate G and the terminal .The reference voltage for the firing detection circuit 10 is set to a much smaller value than the gate voltage when theTriac 2 is on. As described above, it can be known by means of a signal synchronized with the load current or generated on zero crossing of the load current whether the AC switch is on or off, by detecting the voltage across its control terminals. Fig. 3 shows a preferred embodiment in which two or moreAC switches are prevented from conducting simultaneously. A voltage e0 is divided by a transformer 12 into voltages e1, e2 and e3, which are applied to the load i through Triacs 21r 22 and 23. These Triacs are connected to firing circuits 41 42 and 43 and firing detection circuit 101, 102 and 103, respectively. The gates G1, G2 and G3 of the Triacs 21, 22 and 23 are adapted to be controlled by the firing circuits 41 42 and 43, respectively. To the AC power supply 3 is connected a voltage synchronizing circuit 13 for generating firing signals a1, a2 and a3 synchronized with the source voltage e0. The firing circuit 4n n is an integer is controlled by its respective firing command signal generating circuit 14n which generates a firing command signal bn when other firing detection circuits than the corresponding firing detection circuit 10n give a low level signal indicating that the respective Triacs are not conducting and the voltage synchronizing circuit 13 gives a firing signal an. In response to the firing command signal bn, the firing circuit 4n will apply a gate voltage across the gate Gn of the Triac 2n to turn it on. The firing command signal generating circuit 14n includes a NOR gate 15n which receives a signal from the firing detection circuits other than the firing detection circuit 10n, and an AND gate 16n which receives the signal from the NOR gate 15n and a firing single an from the voltage synchronizing circuit 13. In accordance with the present invention, since the voltage across the control terminals of the AC switch is detected, it can be detected whether the AC switch is on or off, even if the load contains a reactor or capacitor component. Two AC switches can be prevented from conducting by turning one AC switch only after detecting that the otherAC switch has turned off. Since the voltage across the control terminals of the AC switch is always a few volts, the same one firing detection circuit can be used regardless of the voltage applied to the AC switch.
