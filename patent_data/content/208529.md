## Description
This invention relates to structural systems formed by prefabricated components used in the manufacture of homes, buildings and other structures and, more particularly, to the eclectic combination of lightweight panel members, load bearing members and reinforcing members in achieving structural rigidity. With increasing emphasis on the need to provide low cost energy efficient housing and buildings, utilization of expanded plastic material and panels for insulation is becoming more prevalent. Such plastic materials are generally applied to conventional construction, or prefabricated in the form of lightweight composite panels applied to conventional on site or prefabricated structures, thereby generally increasing somewhat the cost of such construction. Referring to conventional multifloor structures, these generally incorporate prefabricated panel elements as enclosure material or sheathing, the structure itself being erected in situ using standard structural sections or forming and pouring concrerte around reinforcing steel to form reinforced concrete structural elements. Prefabricated expanded plastic material is also presently used as a filler between sheet metal surfaces, plane or corrugated, affixed to opposing sides of the plastic. Although this solution provides, if properly installed, both required rigidity and thermal properties, it is not particularly applicable to residential construction. The general use of the prefabricated plastic panel or sheet is therefore presently confined to thermal applications and reduction of energy costs, and has done little or nothing to lower initial construction costs. Conventional structural costs may even be increased as a result of accommodating these prefabricated elements to achieve thermal energy savings. Swiss Patent Specification CH A 625297 describes a method of in position adjacent to one another on a foundation in such a way that conduits are defined between the edges of the panels and structural reinforced concrete columns are formed in the conduits. The present invention is characterized in that roof panels of synthetic material are provided which have lateral conduits extending across the tops of the wall conduits and communicating with the wall conduits through apertures in the panels and concrete is applied to form a covering layer over the roof panels and a perimeter beam in the lateral conduits which is integral with the covering layer and with the columns. The following is a summary of the preferred procedure adopted when putting the present invention into effect. A site is prepared and a grade beam constructed. The top of the grade beam is finished to floor level. At intervals, reinforcing rods are anchored to foundations poured integrally with the grade beam. Alternately, plastic or steel I beam columns may be erected and anchored to the foundations. A plurality of prefabricated panels are then asembled at the job site. These panels are manufactured so as to be lightweight for easy handling, and of dimensions such as to form standard building wall and roof components for any selected type structure. Panels will be composed of an expanded plastic material, such as polystyrene, polyurethane, or similar material, and may contain fire retardant chemicals if required. Each panel may be delivered as one piece, or several pieces joined together on site to achieve any required dimension. Joining the panels may be achieved by gluing or bonding together, or pins and splines may be used, separately or in conjunction with the bonding process. Panels may contain a mesh of plastic or metal affixed to one or both sides, or such mesh may be applied following erection on site. Each wall panel will contain edge contours which will surround the previously located reinforcing steel, or steel or plastic I beams, allowing columns to form an integral structure together with the panels following pneumatic or manual application of the concrete or plaster later applied to the panel surfaces. The concrete or plaster will also incorporate a mesh, which if used, is firmly affixed to the reinforcing steel or to the flanges of the plastic or steel I beams. Following setting of the applied or poured concrete, the panel wall units revert to insulation members only, and may even be removed, leaving in place reinforced concrete columns at intervals equivalent to the width of the plastic panels. The reinforcing mesh may be affixed to one, two or no sides of each panel, and mesh placed on both sides of any panel may be joined by wire inserted through any panel prior to application of the concrete and or plaster wall covering. Prefabricated intermediate floor panels or roof sections are assembled and placed similarly to and following erection of the wall panels. In each case, a perimeter beam is poured together with the floor or roof concrete covering. This covering is applied following erection, and a steel mesh is included over the entire roof or floor section, which mesh is first tied or welded to both the column reinforcing steel and to the perimeter beam reinforcing steel so as to achieve a complete reinforced concrete structure which firmly joins all elements together. In the case of the steel beam column, this column must also be firmly fastened to the mesh as well as to the perimeter reinforcing steel so as to achieve the same result. The intermediate floor panels will have beams at intervals, which beams will be perpendicular to the perimeter beam, and the steel for which beams is joined to the perimeter beam steel prior to pouring of the concrete. As is the case with the wall panels, following curing of the concrete, the plastic will revert to a sound and thermal insulator only, and the reinforced concrete beams and slab will absorb any applied loading. The plastic underside will also serve as a flat surface to which ceiling finish of the lower floor may be applied. Curved shapes and other contours may also be used, if required, on the underside of the intermediate floor panels. Roof panels will be assembled and installed similarly to the intermediate floor panels, except that the longitudinal beams perpendicular to the perimeter beams may not be required, dependent upon the selected span. The roof panels will include, however, a cut out on either side so as to enable pouring and joining the upper portion of each lateral column with the perimeter beam, following joining of all reinforcing steel and mesh required for completing the structure. For roof panels, the plastic material will be utilized not only as a form to enable the pouring of the roof slab, but also as a structural component composite section formed by reinforced concrete on top, and expanded plastic below. For long spans, a third tensile member may be incorporated, such a member being a mesh incorporated into the bottom of the plastic material, or applied to and firmly affixed to or near the underside of the plastic material. This tensile member may also be a fiberglass mat affixed to the underside of the expanded plastic. The entire plastic panel erection may be accomplished prior to pouring or placing any concrete, or the assembly of the building may be phased, depending upon the geometry of the completed structure. The concrete may be poured or placed pneumatically, and all columns and beams covered, once joining of the mesh elements and reinforcing steel has been completed. A combination of pouring of certain areas and manual or pneumatic concrete placement of others may also be accomplished. For pneumatic placement and completing of structural elements, gunite or Shotcrete may be used. Gunite and Shotcrete are two processes for pneumatically applying high density, low water concrete which cures to a very high strength such as from 34 to 55 MPa 5000 to 8000 PSI . The process allows completion of a structure with a minimum of labor intensive formwork, and will result in a great economy in construction. In addition, the thermal and acoustic properties of the plastic panels will result in an energy efficient, sound proof and low cost construction solution. Electrical, plumbing, and HVAC i.e., heating, ventilating and air conditioning problems are also easily accommodated by the process. Channels and ducts may be molded into the panels prior to erection, or cut into the plastic following erection. These services may also be partially accommodated in the floor slab which may be poured following building erection. The HVAC ducting may be installed in the eave overhang of the roof panels so as not to interfere with the structural characteristics of the composite roof panel, and connected to the interior of the structure via openings left or cut into the wall panels between the columns and beneath the perimeter beam formed into the roof panels. The inherent advantages and improvements of the present invention will become more readily apparent upon reference to the following detailed description of the invention and by reference to the drawings wherein Referring now to Fig. 1 of the drawings, there is shown a section of a wall for a building structure. A panel member 22a is provided with a plastic core, an optional outer wall mesch member 26 plus an optional inner wall mesh member 28. Mesh members 26, 28 may be fixedly secured to each other through the plastic core or hung on the plastic core by suitable hooks, not shown. Following erection and placement of the mesh, a concrete 29 or plastic 31 or other coating is applied manually or pneumatically to the mesh covered surfaces of the panel. These materials bond firmly to the plastic material and to the mesh, allowing then a structural member of great strength to be formed. Fig. 1 also illustrates a roof panel member indicated generally at 40a which has a central plastic core 42, an upper or outer mesh member 44 and an optional lower or inner mesh member 46. An extension 48a provides an overhang for the roof. The extension 48a is provided with an upstanding or elevated end lip member 50 so as to provide restraining means for a layer of concrete which is poured atop the upper surface of the roof panel member 40a. While roof panel member 40a is generally provided with straight sides, it may taper inwardly as the panel structure approaches an apex of the roof structure. In Fig. 2 a reinforced concrete column member is indicated generally at 54 which is in the plane of the wall. The panel member 22a is provided with a longitudinally extending groove so as to receive reinforced concrete therein thus establishing a perimeter beam for the structure extending around the four sides thereof. The pouring of the concrete on an in situ basis is effected prior to placement of the roof panel members 40a, or following placement of the roof panel members 40a, with the aid of a plurality of apertures 58 which provide conduits for the concrete that provides a layer thereof atop the roof panel members designated 40a in Figs. 4 and 5. These apertures 58 extend entirely through the roof panel members 40a. Optionally, the panel members 40a may be provided with an air conditioning duct 51 and an optional soffit member 53. Fig. 4 also shows an air conditioning duct 51, soffit member 53 and a grill member 55. With the ducts for heating, ventilating and air conditioning located outside the enclosed perimeter of the house, these ducts may be brought into communication with the inside of the house by openings cut through the perimeter walls. As can also be seen in Figs. 1, 5 and 6, roof members 48a and intermediate floor panel members 40a may be also provided with longitudinally extending channels 60 to receive reinforced concrete therein. For relatively short spans, the channel 60 is not required, the concrete and the plastic forming a composite beam. Additionally, as will be observed in Figs. 6 and 7, at least one laterally extending conduit 62 is provided in fluid communication with the longitudinally extending channel means 60, and the columns 54, and is poured together with the extension of the reinforced column 54, joining together the entire structure. Preferably, a laterally extending conduit such as is illustrated at 62 is provided at opposite ends of the roof panel member 40a. While the reinforced conduit itself is not illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, it is illustrated in Figs. 5 7 at 64. Reference to Fig. 3 illustrates a typical building manufactured in accordance with the present invention. As is illustrated, the invention is applicable to multi storey buildings as well as to single story buildings. This figure illustrates the general relationship between the reinforced concrete column members 54 and the reception of individual panel members 22 therebetween. The building illustrates optional tapered rafters 66 with the roof panel members removed for purposes of clarity. The tapered rafters are not required for short spans, and, if employed, may be tapered or parallel sided. The specific construction for the peak of the building is not critical insofar as the present invention is concerned and may be effected in any conventional manner, with or without a reinforced concrete ridge beam 89. Referring now to Figs. 8 and 9, there are illustrated two methods of forming the concrete column members 54. In the figure 8 embodiment, two molded panel members 22b having top and bottom major surfaces, are provided with cooperating corner grooves which extend for the height of the panel members 22b. The panel members are abutted so as to align the cooperating corner grooves or notches 68 and the previously installed and anchored reinforcing by vertical rebars 90, and establish at least a major portion of a mold cavity. The mold cavity in this instance may be completed by straddling the adjacent grooves of the abutting panel members with a temporary form member 70 to complete the mold cavity, then pouring the concrete into the cavity so as to form a concrete column and permanently establish a portion of a wall with the abutting panel members of the concrete column. Or, following attachment of the outer mesh 26 to the appropriately located vertical rebar 90 with the aid of the members 91, the cavity formed may be filled with gunite at the same time that surface 22b is concreted over mesh 26, binding the entire structure. Alternatively, the panel members 22b may be removed and other panel members supplied. In the embodiment of Fig. 9, cooperating longitudinal grooves 72 are provided in the sides of panel members 22c between the top and bottom major surfaces thereof so as to complete the mold cavity for reception of concrete. The cavity will be formed around previously placed and anchored vertical rebars 90, following which the concrete is poured or tremied into the mold cavity. Again it is possible either to leave the panel members 22c in place forming a permanent portion of a wall or to remove the panel members 22c and utilize other panel members. The rebar should be previously located so that the mesh can be attached prior to the guniting or plastering of the outer vertical wall sections, thereby joining the entire structure when the column and the vertical wall surfaces are gunited. In the embodiment of Fig. 9a, the panel members are not provided with end grooves. Instead the panels are positioned a distance apart equal to the width of the vertical column members and a temporary formwork 70 spans the gap in the rear between the adjacent panels. The rebars 90 are placed in position and the mesh in front of the panels is secured to the reinforcing rebars. The column member is then formed by guniting through the mesh to fill the cavity. After the reinforced concrete hardens, the temporary form member 70 is removed. Returning now to the illustration in Fig. 5, the reinforced concrete column members 54 illustrated in this figure may be formed by either of the methods illustrated in Figs. 8 and 9 after which the concrete is poured atop the flat roof or intermediate floor panel members 40a at the same time filling the optional longitudinally extending channels 60. The laterally extending channel or conduit 62 flowing into the area designated 64a immediately above columns 54 are filled at the same time, firmly joining the conduit 62 to the columns 54. Fig. 10 illustrates a core structure 22d for a modular panel member which comprises a heat insulating plastic member 24 which is molded with top and bottom major surfaces and which has a rigid strip member 76 embedded therewithin. The rigid strip member 76 is provided with substantially V shaped corrugations which have ridges substantially coincident with the top major surface of the molded plastic core 24 and troughs which are substantially coincident with the bottom major surface of plastic core 24. To facilitate the foaming of the molded plastic core 24, the rigid strip member 76 may also be provided with a plurality of apertures 77, either randomly or regularly placed. While the reinforcement provided by rigid strip member 76 will prevent bending about one axis, in order to prevent bending at 90 degrees thereto, the rigid strip member 76 is provided with slots 78 at a plurality of locations so as to provide parallel lines of slots which then receive a plurality of tension members 80 thereby inhibiting bending about two plans 90 degrees with respect to each other. While the drawing depicts the deposition of a plurality of tension members 80 in the ridges of the rigid strip member 76, it is also possible to provide a similar set of tension members 80 in the troughs of the rigid strip member 76. Tension members may be rods, wires, fiberglass, or plastic. Fig. 11 illustrates another core structure for a modular panel member designated 22e. In this panel member a heat insulating plastic member 24 is molded with parallel top and bottom major surfaces and a honeycomb member indicated generally at 82 is embedded therewithin. The honeycomb member 82 has cell members which extend between the top and bottom major surfaces of the heat insulating plastic member 24 and an optional frame means 84 may extend around the sides and ends of the core structure, or may be placed within the perimeter of the plastic core rectangle, thereby forming framed openings for doors and windows. Figs. 12 and 13 illustrate two preferred building panels for roof structures. In both embodiments a core construction of styrofoam or similar core material is illustrated at 24 and a thin layer of reinforced concrete 64 is applied atop the styrofoam core. In both embodiments a relatively thin tensile member is secured to the bottom of the styrofoam core. In the figure 15 embodiment, the relatively thin tensile member is a metal mesh member 46 and in the figure 16 embodiment, the relatively thin tensile member is fiberglass. The tensile members may be then covered with plaster or concrete, forming a composite beam type structure. The panel members of the present invention permit all openings to be either cast in or cut in either before or after the covering operations. Provisions may be made for air conditioning and other duct work including electrical conduit raceways or other devices for inserting electrical cables or the like. The panels may also be ducted for water and sewer connection. As is generally known, composite structure are employed in many different ways in the construction process. The foregoing deals with a non conventional application of construction materials, and in particular with the utilization of expanded polystyrene or polyurethane or similar , which serves not only as a formwork to receive a deck or wall or roof slab, but also serves to cooperate with a concrete or reinforced concrete slab to resist externally applied loads. Finally, the same expanded plastic foam serves as an insulating thermal material of superior quality. In the function of cooperating to resist an externally applied load, the material when joined to a reinforced concrete slab which absorbs compressive forces, assists in achieving longer spans than would be the case without the foam. The resistance of the reinforced concrete slab above would be calculated by the formula I Moment of inertia with respect to the neutral axis. In the case of the composite section the same formula would apply, but considering that the upper reinforced concrete section may now be multiplied by a factor n In the particular case of the roof of a building, if the polystyrene thickness is three or five times the thickness of the reinforced concrete roof slab, the factor n will allow much longer clear spans than would be the case without the plastic over which the slab is poured. The addition of a tension member at the bottom of the slab greatly increases this effect. The tension member could be a steel or plastic mesh located at the bottom of the plastic section, or could be metal, fiberglass, or similar strands applied to the bottom of the plastic, as long as a firm adherance is achieved. While presently preferred embodiments of the inventions have been illustrated and described, it will be recognized that the invention may be otherwise variously embodied and practiced within the scope of the claims which follow.
