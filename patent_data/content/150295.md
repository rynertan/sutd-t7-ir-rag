# SELECTIVE PRODUCTION OF N SUBSTITUTED AMIDES BY USE OF CU O METALLIC OXIDES CATALYST COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
This invention provides a process for the selective conversion of aliphatic and aromatic aminonitriles, such as epsilon aminocapronitrile, or mixtures of a primary amine, MNHRâ‚‚, such as N butylamine, and a nitrile, MCN, such as acetonitrile, into N substituted amides, such as epsilon caprolactam or N butylacetamide, employing a Cu O cata lyst in combination with oxides of a Group IVB, VB or VIB metal except chromium. The present invention, also provided a method of preparing a catalyst composition com prising Cu O , substantially free of oxidized forms of Cu O and finaly dispersed in oxides of a metal which is Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Mo or W, which comprises treating a substance comprising oxidized Cu and metal oxides with hydrogen at a pressure of at least about 100 kPa and at a temperature greater than about 250 C preferably about 350 450 C for a time sufficient to produce a catalyst composition compris ing Cu O , substantially free of oxidized forms of Cu O , finely dispersed in the metal oxides. The present invention also contemplates a catalyst composition comprising Cu O , substantially free of oxides forms of Cu O and finely dis persed in oxides of Group IVB, VB or VIB metals except chromium.
