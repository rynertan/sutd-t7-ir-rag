# Nuclear magnetic resonance method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A method of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of a body in which the spins of a chosen nucleus in a selected slice 43 of the body are rotated through an angle appreciably greater than 90 by applying, in sequence, two substantially identical r.f. pulses B₁ 90 , B₂ 90 accompanied by a magnetic field having a gradient G ₁z, G₂z in a direction orthogonal to the plane of the slice 43 . Each r.f. pulse is at the Larmor frequency for the chosen nuclei in the slice 43 , and is effective to rotate the spins by not greater than 90 and the r.f. pulses together are sufficient to rotate the spins through the angle. The gradients of the magnetic fields are in opposite directions.
