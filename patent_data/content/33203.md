# SUBSTRATE FOR CATALYTIC SYSTEM AND FERRITIC STAINLESS STEEL FROM WHICH IT IS FORMED

## Abstract
A system comprising a ferritic stainless steel substrate having a tightly adherent oxide coating and a catalytic mater ial thereupon, and the ferritic stainless steel from which the substrate is formed. The ferritic stainless steel is of a chemis try which forms a tightly adherent non spalling scale suitable for application of a catalytic bearing material and consists essentially of, by weight, up to 26 chromium, from 1 to 8 aluminium, between 0.01 and 0.1 yttrium, up to 0.1 car bon, up to 2 silicon, balance essentially iron.
