# Apparatus for the provision of vertical drain channels in grass, fields, meadows etc.

## Abstract
The apparatus has pins 15 which are pivotably con nected to the end of a first rod 5 which is pivotable 8 with its other end in the frame of the apparatus, a second rod 11 extending substantially parallel to the first rod 5 being pivot ably connected with one end 12 to a point of the pin 15 below the pivot point 4 . The other end 10 of the second rod 11 is likewise pivotably provided in the frame of the apparatus, the second rod having a yielding portion 16 . The pins 15 penetrate into the soil substantially along a straight line, but pivot rearwardly around the pivots 4 as permitted by the resilient portion 16 in the second rod 11 . Thereby the hole made is widened at its lower end for better water storing capacity while at the same time the soil is crumbled and the hole wall made porous for better water permeability. During the pivotal movement of the pins they remain substantially stationary at the location of the soil surface or turf, so that no damage of the turf is produced.
