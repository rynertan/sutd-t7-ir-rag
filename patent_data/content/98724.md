## Description
SINGLE CRYSTAL PRODUCTION The present invention relates to a method for producing single crystals. Various methods for producing single crystals have so far been devised and put to practical use. One known method is a flame fusion method called Verneuil s method in this the material to be crystallised is dropped in powder form through a flame e.g. oxygen hydrogen and the molten material is accumulated on a receiver on which the single crystal grows up gradually the powder passes into the flame through a sieve at the bottom of a container of the powder, the container being vibratable.This method uses no crucibles, so that there is little contamination with impurities in the course of crystal growth and it can give larger single crystals in a shorter time than other methods.Because of this, single crystals of alumina Al203 , spinel MgA1204 , rutile TiO2 , strontium titanate SrTiO , yttrium aluminum garnet Y3Al5012 and gadolinium gallium garnet Gd3Ga5012 types are now produced in large quantities by this method not only as artificial jewels but also as industrial materials such as abrasion resistant materials e.g. bearings, wrist watch glasses and laser materials. Verneuil s method however, has the defect that single crystals cannot be obtained unless the powder falls uniformly through the sieve without blocking. The powder material used must therefore have good flowability in addition to high purity and easy fusibility there has so far been used powder having a fine particle size of not more than 1 pm intended for easy fusibility and a low bulk density intended for good flowability.For example, for alumina type single crystals, there is in use a scaly y alumina powder obtained by thermal decomposition of ammonium alum at about 10000C. This powder, because of its scaly form, is not prone to cause blocking in the container, showing good flowability because of its very low bulk density, however, it requires a container so large that applying vibration is difficult and the accuracy of the amount of powder passing through the sieve can be poor furthermore, because the powder is very light, considerable quantities may be blown off to the surroundings during passage through the flame, whereby the yield of single crystal from the expensive material can be poor.In addition, the powder obtained by thermal decomposition of ammonium alum has a very wide particle size distribution, and must first be sieved to remove oversize particles, further reducing the yield of single crystal from the initial material. The conventional method described above tries to secure flowability at the expense of the yield from the expensive powder, but even so flowability varies widely between production lots due to the great difficulty in obtaining powder materials of constant particle shape by the conventional thermal decomposition of ammonium alum, and the low bulk density makes handling difficult. It has therefore been very difficult to produce standardised single crystals. The present invention provides a powder fusion method for single crystal production in which spherically granulated material is used as the powder. The yield of single crystal can thereby be improved compared to that using the prior scaly material because the spherically granulated starting material has high bulk density as well as good flowability furthermore single crystals of uniform good quality can be obtained because the powder material used has uniform flowability. One method for spherically granulating a material for single crystal formation comprises granulating a slurry comprising the powder material and a liquid carrier e.g. water or organize solvent on a spray drier or fluidizing drier.Granulation by spray drier is particularly preferred in terms of the particle size of granules obtained.The particle size of the granule can optionally be selected according to the flowability and ease of fusibility required. A particle size between 5 and 200 um is preferred because granules below 5 um may tend to fly about whilst passing through the fusion zone e.g. flame , resulting in poor yields, and granules above 200 pm may take too long to fuse e.g. until after contacting the single crystal growing portion. The slurry of powder material for.use in granulation can be prepared using conventional equipment, e.g. stirrers, ball mills, and ultrasonic dispersing machines. Materials to which the method of the present invention can be applied include not only the powdery material previously used in Verneuilts method, but also powdery materials which could not be previously used because of poor flowability.Various additives may be incorporated to impart colour or for other functions provided that the effect of the present invention is not destroyed.For obtaining good quality single crystals, however, it is desirable to limit the amount of additive to less than 5 by weight. Examples of materials suitable for use in spherically granulated form in the present invention include alumina A1203 , spinel MgA1204 , rutile TiO2 , strontium titanate SrTiO3 , yttrium aluminum garnet Y3A15012 and gadolinium gallium garnet Gd Ga 012 types of which the content of main component is preferably at least 95 by weight. It is particularly preferred, in terms of the ease of material preparation, to apply the present invention to alumina single crystals. The purity of the powdery materials and additives used largely affects the quality of single crystals obtained, so that it is desirable to use products of as high purity as possible.Preferably the powdery materials which are a main component should have a purity of at least 99.9 by weight. Alumina single crystals of particularly good quality can be obtained when high puritymaterials of not less than 99.99 by weight purity are used. The method of the present invention is suitably performed using the apparatus already known for use in Verneuil s single crystal production method. The present invention is illustrated more specifically by the following Examples and comparative examples, but is not to be interpreted as limited to these examples. All percents in the examples are by weight.Example 1 One kilogram of a alumina having a particle size of 0.5 ijm and a purity of 99.9970 produced by Sumitomo Chemical Co. and 1.5 kg. of water were mixed into a slurry by an alumina made ball mill. This slurry was granulated on a rotary disk type spray drier to obtain 0.98 kg. of spherical granules having an average particle size of 60 urn. The spherical a alumina granules thus obtained had a bulk density as high as 0.8 g cm3, did not fly, and were easily handled as well as of very good flowability.Using these alumina granule as material in the apparatus commonly used inVerneuil s single crystal producing method, a white sapphire single crystal was produced at a growth rate of 20 mm hr while using oxygen and hydrogen gases at mixing combustion rates of 0.3 m3 hr and 3 1.5 m3 hr, respectively. The single crystal obtained was of very good quality with no material attached to. its surface. The yield of single crystal from the a alumina granules was as high as 96 . Example 2 One kilogram of y alumina having a particle size of 0.05 uin and a purity of 99.99 obtained by calcination of aluminum hydroxide produced by Sumitomo Chemical Co. and 5.5 kg. of water were mixed into a slurry by an alumina made ball mill. This slurry was granulated on a twofluid nozzle type spray drier to obtain 0.95 kg. of spherical granules having an average particle size of 40 um. The spherical y alumina granules thus 3 obtained had a bulk density as high as 0.8 g cm3, did not fly and were easily handled as well as of very good flowability. Using these granules, a white sapphire single crystal was produced in the same manner as in Example 1. The single crystal obtained was of very good quality with no material attached to its surface.The yield of single crystal from the y alumina granule was as high as 95 .Comparative example 1 By thermal decomposition of ammonium alum was produced y alumina of particle size 0.05 urn, 3 bulk density 0.2 g cm3 and 99.99 purity, comprising powder agglomerates having a scaly form and an average agglomerate size of 80 urn. This y alumina powder was very difficult to handle because it tended to fly when transferred from one container to another. Using this y alumina powder, single crystals were produced in the same manner as in Example 1, but the single crystal obtained had alumina powder attached to its whole surface. The yield of single crystal from the. y alumina powder was as low as 80 .Comparative example 2 The production of sapphire single crystals was tried with the same apparatus as in Example 1, using the same y alumina powder as in Example 2 produced from aluminum hydroxide but not granulated.This non granulated y alumina powder was of low flowability and hardly fell down into the oxygenhydrogen flame so that a single crystal did not grow at all.Example 3 In the slurry preparation in Example 1, 2 of Cur 0 powder having a particle size of 0.5 urn 23 produced by Nippon Kagaku Kgyo Co. was added to the high purity a alumina powder. The mixture was granulated on a rotary disk type spray drier to obtain spherical granules having an average particle size of 60 urn. The Cr203 containing alumina 23 granules thus obtained had a bulk density as high as 0.8 g cm3, did not fly and were easily handled as well as of very good flowability because of the spherical form. Using these granules, a ruby single crystal was produced under the same heating conditions as in Example 1 and at a growth rate of 15 mm hr. The single crystal obtained was of very good quality, and the yield of single crystal was as high as 96 . Whilst the method of the present invention has been described in use with apparatus of theVerneuil s crystal growth method, wherein the powder is e.g. released from a tube coaxial with the combustion gas supply and directly into the flame for fusion, other similar apparatus for single crystal growth may be used within the scope of the invention. Similarly, whilst the invention has been described utilising an oxygen hydrogen flame for powder fusion, other suitable gaseous combustion mixtures or other heating methods may be used.
