# Laser alignement apparatus.

## Abstract
An optical apparatus 10 includes a laser 15 for generating a scanning beam, and compact, folded optical system for transmitting the beam to an object 11 to be scanned. The optical system includes a modulator 27 for modulating the beam in accordance with video image sig nals, and a rotatary polygon 35 for scanning the beam across the object. The laser is supported at one end in a spherical bearing 56 , permitting pivotal movement of the laser about a point P coincident with the optical axis 0 of the apparatus, and at its other end by screws 81 which are used to displace the laser about the pivot point and so align the axis of the laser beam with the optical axis of the apparatus.
