# Fuel control apparatus.

## Abstract
A fuel control apparatus for a gas turbine engine, in which operational fuel is supplied to the engine through a primary metering valve responsive to movement of a power lever within a normal operational range, and a secondary, normally closed metering valve which is responsive to movement of said power lever within an emergency opera tional range in the event of a malfunction in the operation of the primary metering valve electrical power failure, for instance . The invention provides for automatic detection of a possible malfunction by a sensor 402 and automatic transfer of the fuel flow requirement from the primary metering valve 56 to the secondary metering valve 62 without moving the power lever 36 when the fuel flow requirement is below a predetermined level. For use particularly in the control of aircraft turbine engines.
