# CLAMP FOR A CABLE OR THE LIKE

## Abstract
The clamp consists of a u shaped plastic strip 1 having toothed legs 2 3 . The teeth 7 are arranged to engage against and behind the edge 6 of apertures 5 in a support ing surface 4 to which the clamp is to be secured. In opera tion as the clamp is pushed over a group of cables c it tightens the cables against a supporting surface 4 . The clamp is retained in position by the teeth engaging against and behind the aperture edge. An outward force is induced in the clamp by the initial deflection of the clamp legs to engage the panel aperture and by the clamped cables pushing out wards against the clamp legs.
