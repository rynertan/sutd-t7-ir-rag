## Description
Description A Recoil Damper for a Reciprocating MemberTechnical Field This invention relates to rock breaking machinery. In particular it relates to a recoil damper for the reciprocating member of such machinery.Background Art In reciprocating machinery, and particularly rock breakers, there is a requirement to dampen the motion of the reciprocating mechanism on the recoil stroke. In some rock breakers an eccentric mechanism provides intermittent power strokes to the rock breaker tip or shank through an intermediate impact link located between the eccentric and the shank. In the earlier impact devices the shank was usually impacted directly by the eccentric ring. A seal was generally provided between the shank and the housing.The seal generally experienced a short life due to the large number of cycles and large displacement 8 1 2 to 9 cm during each cycle. Recoil of the shank was absorbed by conventional dampening devices located exterior of the drive mechanism. An example of such an exterior recoil damper is found in U.S. Patent 3,868,145. With the advent of a limited displacement 11 2 cm type intermediate impact link positioned between the eccentric and the shank, the intermediate impact link itself must be dampened as it is relatively free floating in comparison to the more ccnventional shank and eccentric. That is, the intermediate impact link, being located between the enclosed eccentric and the exterior shank, transmits the force of the eccentric to the shank. In order to provide relatively free movement toward the shank, the intermediate impact link is mounted in appropriate bearings positioned in the housing. However, upon recoil, the recoil force would ordinarily be transmitted to the eccentric thus causing excessive wear on the eccentric unless some form of recoil damper is used. In such intermediate impact link type rock breakers, the force to be applied to the shank ordinarily does not occur until the shank is displaced rearwardly to engage the intermediate impact link which is also displaced rearwardly into position to be contacted by the eccentric. As the eccentric rotates so that its periphery contacts the intermediate impact link, the force of the eccentric is transmitted through the intermediate impact link to the shank which in turn acts on the working surface. As the eccentric continues to rotate, the force is relieved from the intermediate impact link, thus permitting the shank to recoil with such recoil transmitted to the intermediate impact link. Although the motion of the shank could be dampened in the manner shown in U.S.Patent No. 3,868,145, that is an exterior damper may be mounted adjacent the shank, the recoil motion of the intermediate impact link which is contained substantially within the housing must also be dampened. The present invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems as set forth above. Disclosure of the Invention In one aspect of the present invention a recoil damper includes a reciprocating member mounted iii a housing for movement in first and second opposite directions. The housing defines a first cavity adjacent the reciprocating member with a recoil device mounted in the first cavity. The reciprocating member includes a shoulder located in the first cavity which cooperates with the recoil mechanism to retard movement of the reciprocating member in a first direction while allowing relatively free movement of the reciprocating member in the second direction. The present invention dampens the motion of a reciprocating member in one direction while permitting relatively free movement of the reciprocating member in the other opposite direction.This recoil dampening is particularly appropriate in those devices such as rock breakers that require a force to be imparted to a tool, which may result in the recoil force of the tool being imparted back to the machine.Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1 is a schematic view, partly in section, of an embodiment of a recoil damper as used with an intermediate link of a rock breaker. Figure 2 is a detailed sectional view of the embodiment of the recoil damper shown in Figure 1. Figure 3 is a schematic view of an alternate embodiment of the recoil damper.Best Mode of Carrying Out the Invention Referring to Figure 1, a recoil damper 10 is shown with an intermediate impact link 12 of an impact type rock breaker. The impact type rock breaker consists of a shank 14 having as a portion thereof a rock breaker tip 16 used to impact and thus break rock. An eccentric mechanism 18 provides intermittent power strokes to intermediate impact link 12 which in turn are transmitted to shank 14. It should be noted thatFigure 1 illustrates the rock breaker in the at rest condition. As the rock breaker tip 16 is brought into contact with the material to be broken, the shank 14, which is pivoted from a mounting not shown , is in turn brought into contact with a portion 20 of intermediate impact link 12.Further imposition of force by rock breaker tip 16 against a surface to be broken results in intermediate impact link 12 moving downwardly as shown in Figure 1 or in a first direction thus bringing the intermediate impact link 12 into the range of eccentric 18. This range is denoted by the dashed circle 22 in Figure 1. As eccentric 18 rotates, it will contact intermediate impact link 12 to urge it in a second opposite direction. Housing 24 defines a bore 25 in which intermediate impact link 12 is slidably positioned.Also defined in housing 24 is a cavity 26 generally adjacent the midpoint of bore 25 of housing 24.Intermediate impact link 12 is preferably cylindrical and has a shoulder 28 extending generally about the midpoint thereof. The shoulder 28 is adapted to be received in the cavity 26. In order to form cavity 26 and to concurrently receive shoulder 28, housing 24 must be made in at least two portions, front portion 30 and rear portion 32. In the embodiment shown in Figure 1, a mid portion 34 is also utilized to facilitate installation of other centering devices 36 utilized to center intermediate impact link 12 in housing 24.Appropriate fastening means 37, in this instance elongated bolts, are utilized to interconnect the various portions of housing 24. Damping means 35 for retarding movement of the reciprocating intermediate impact link 12 are located in cavity 26. These means include an annular ring 38 which, in this embodiment, is formed to slidably move on shoulder 28 of intermediate impact link 12 in said first and second directions. Formed in annular ring 38 are a plurality of orifices 40.Each orifice 40 is oriented in the axial direction thus permitting communication of a viscous fluid which also forms a portion of the means for retarding recoil and which is located in cavity 26. Annular ring 38 is biased toward front portion 30 of housing 24 by a plurality of resilient members such as helical springs 42. Located at the rearward end of cavity 26 is a stop 44. Referring toFigure 2, it can be seen that stop 44 may also be an annular ring which is located adjacent the outer portion of cavity 26. The inner diameter of stop 44 is less than the outer diameter of annular ring 38, so that upon movement of annular ring 38 downwardly as shown in Figure 2, ring 38 will contact stop 44 before coming into contact with housing 24. A plurality of grooves 45 are formed in the upper surface of stop 44 so that fluid trapped in cavity 26a and cavity 26b with annular ring 38 seated or in close proximity to stop 44 may pass thereby into cavity 26c. It can be seen in Figure 1 that intermediate impact link 12 is journaled by appropriate bearings 46 in housing 24. Bearings 46 are preferably relatively fluid tight and thus also substantially impervious to deleterious material which could affect the operation of eccentric 18. It should be understood that eccentric 18, which is driven by a prime mover not shown , is preferably sealed in a chamber 48 which may also be filled with lubricant or the like. At the other opposite end of intermediate impact link 12 is portion 20 which, as shown in Figure 1, need not be integral with intermediate impact link 12, but rather be received in a central bore 50 of intermediate impact link 12. This particular construction is appropriate to provide a replaceable portion of the intermediate impact link 12.Industrial Applicability Referring to Figure 1, a recoil damper 10 is shown in the environment of a rock breaker which consists of a shank 14, an intermediate impact link 12, and an eccentric 18. The intermediate impact link 12 is mounted in the housing 24 for movement in first and second opposite directions. As shown in Figure 1, the rock breaker embodiment is in the at rest condition with intermediate impact link 12 just resting on the range circle 22 of eccentric 18. Bringing the rock breaker tip 16 into contact with a working surface not shown results in shank 14 moving downwardly as shown inFigure 1 into contact with portion 20. Further movement of rock breaker tip 16 downwardly results in intermediate impact link 12 moving downwardly against the centering forces of devices 36. As point 51 of eccentric 18 moves around circle 22, contact is made with surface 52 of intermediate impact link 12 by eccentric 18 at a point on the surface thereof between point 53 on the base circle of eccentric 18 and point 51.As a result of this contact, intermediate impact link 12 is thrust upwardly in Figure 1 causing shank 14 to impart the force of eccentric 18 against the working surface or rock. Referring to Figure 2, the link 12 is shown in its movement in a second direction during ehe force stroke toward the working surface. The viscous fluid contained in cavity 26 has been partially compressed in front of the leading edge of shoulder 28 thus forcing annular ring 38 downwardly against the biasing force of helical spring 42. This movement allows relatively free flow of fluid from the forward portion of cavity 26 denoted as 26a in Figure 2 around the shoulder 28 and annular ring 38 through the annular cavity 26b formed between the outer surface of annular ring 38 and cavity 26 and into the area 26c behind shoulder 28 and annular ring 38. As intermediate impact link 12 reaches its full forward or up position, the helical spring 42 urges annular ring 38 back toward the position shown in Figure 1.When recoil motion starts, fluid in portion 26c of cavity 26 is influenced by shoulder 28 moving downwardly.With annular ring 38 in the up position as shown inFigure 1, fluid is then forced to escape through orifice 40 into cavity 26a thus restricting or retarding movement of the intermediate impact link 12 in the downward direction. The device 36 serves to center intermediate impact link 12 generally at a mid position as shown in Figure 1 so that without rock breaker tip 16 being in contact with a working surface, the intermediate impact link 12 will remain out of contact with eccentric 18. Finally, stop 44 limits movement of annular ring 38 downwardly during the force stroke.Should annular ring 38 contact stop 44 or come in close proximity thereto during the upward stroke of link 12, grooves 45 will allow the flow of fluid from cavity 26a to cavity 26c. By appropriate sizing of the cavities, annular ring 38 need never come in contact with stop 44 except in extreme conditions.A Second Mode for Carrying Out the Invention Referring now to Figure 3, a second mode for carrying out this invention in the same environment is shown. The like parts are denoted by the same numerals, while new parts are denoted by new numerals. In this embodiment the damping means 135 includes an annular ring 138 that has an inside diameter slightly smaller than the outside diameter of shoulder 28 so that during the at rest position, annular ring 138 may rest against the rear surface 54 of shoulder 28. Resilient means such as a helical spring 144 serve to urge annular ring 138 into this position. Annular ring 138 has formed therein a plurality of axial orifices 140 in the manner of an annular ring 38 in the just described embodiment.Industrial Applicability of the Second Mode Operation of the second embodiment is quite similar to the first embodiment and will be described in the same context of the rock breaker. Movement of intermediate link 12 in the upward direction as shown in Figure 3 results in a fluid contained in portion 26a of cavity 26 passing freely around shoulder 28 and the opening formed between forward surface 150 of annular ring 138 and lower surface 54 of shoulder 28. As recoil starts, annular ring 138 is urged upwardly by helical spring 144 to come into contact with surface 54 of shoulder 28 thus blocking communication of fluid through the opening between surfaces 54 and 150. Fluid is then forced through orifice 140 as intermediate impact link 12 moves. Such flow of fluid through orifice 140 retards the movement of intermediate impact link 12 in the downward direction.
