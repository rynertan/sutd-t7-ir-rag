The complexes of this invention are useful in tumor chemotherapy having been found active against malignant tumors in animals as, for example, Sarcoma 180 ascites tumors in mammals such as mice. The anti tumor effect exhibited by the subject complexes may also extend to other sarcomas and lymphoid leukemias and to such other tumors as the following lymphosarcoma, myelocytic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, scirrhous carcinoma, malignant melanoma, seminoma, teratoma, choriocarcinoma, embryonalcarcinoma, cystadenocarcinoma, endometriocarcinoma or neuroblastoma and the like. In addition, said complexes may be useful as anti viral, anti inflammatory, anti bacterial and anti parasitic agents. The complexes of this invention may be administered parenterally or orally in admixture with a non toxic pharmacologically acceptable inert carrier or diluent in any of the usual pharmaceutical forms. These include solid and liquid oral unit dosage forms such as tablets capsules, powders, nd suspensions or solutions and suspensions for subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or intra arterial injection. The term unit dosage refers to physically discrete units which may be administered in single or multiple dosages each containing a predetermined quantity of the active ingredient in association with the required diluent, carrier or vehicle. The quantity of active ingredient is the amount of complex needed to produce the dcsired therapeutic effect. A typical unit dosage consists essentially of from about 10 450 mg. of active ingredient however, the form in which said ingredient is administered and the frequency of administration is usually determinative of its concentration. Thus, for example, oral unit dosage forms containing 20 450 mg. of active ingredient may be administered one or more times per day depending upon the severity of the tumor which is sought to be treated and the condition of the host animal. By contrast, parenteral administration generally requires from about 10 100 mg. of the active in gredient per unit dosage administered as a daily dose or as a fraction thereof depending upon whether the regimen calls for administration once, twice, three or four times daily. By contrast to the unit dosage , the effective dose is that total dosage which is needed to achieve the desired anti tumor effect. In general, this dosage lies within the range of from about 10 950 mg. of the active ingredient per kg. of body weight of the host animal i.e., mg. kg. . referred concentration lies within the range of from about 30 450 mg. kg. For oral administration an effective dose of 50 950 mg. kg. has been found to be most suitable, whereas, in the case of parenteral administration it is usually advisable to employ from about 30 350 mg. kg. These dosages are well below the toxic or lethal dose and they may be varied over a wide range for the symptomatic adjust ment of the dosage to the patient which is being treated. The preterrgd compositions for oral administration are tablets in which the gold purine complex is present in quantities of 5 375 mg. in a pharmaceutically acceptable orally ingestible solid carrier. If desired, the composition may also contain flavors, binders, lubricants and other excipients known in the art. An alternative oral mode is the soft gelatin capsule.Such a composition may also contain from 10 375 mg. by weight of active ingredient dissolved or suspended in vegetable oil, peanut oil, alcohol or glycerine and the like. A hard or dry filled capsule may be prepared by admixing 25 200 mg. of active ingredient with suitable excipients such as lactose and magnesium stearate and putting the mixture into a preformed and suitably sized gelatin sheath. The complexes of this invention may also be formulated as liquid solutions or suspensions or as a dry powder for addition to foods, drinking water, fruit juice or other potable liquids. Tablets are prepared by mixing a complex of this invention, in suitably comminuted or powdered form, with a diluent or base such as starch, kaolin or dicalcium phosphate and the like. The resulting mixture can be granulated by wetting with a binder such as a syrup, starch paste , acacia mucilage or solutions of cellulosic or polymeric materials, whereafter, the wetted mixture is forced through a screen. As an alternative to granulating, the powdered mixture can be run through a tablet machine and any slugs which are imperfect may be broken into granules. Thegranules are lubricated to prevent sticking to tlie tablet forminy dies via the addition o stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc or mineral oil and the lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets.The complexes of this invention can also be combined with free flowing inert carriers and then be subjected to ccmpression so as to form tablets without going through the granulating or slugging steps. A protective coating or sealing coat of shellac, sugar or polymeric material and a polished coating of wax can also be provided. Dyestuffs may be added to distinguish different unit dosages. In this invention the term pharmacologically accep table inert carrier or diluent denotes a non toxic substance which, when mixed with the active ingredient, renders it more suitable for administration. Compositions intended for oral administration may include such carriers or diluents as lactose, corn starch, potato starch, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, powdered gum tragacanth, gelatin, alginic acid, agar, stearic acid or the sodium, calcium and magnesium salts of stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and di calcium phosphate.Said compositions may also contain non toxic adjuvants and modifiers such as dyes, buffering agents, preservatives, surfactants, emulsifiers, flavoring agents or biocides and the like.

Examples 1 Il, infra, illustrate the method by which the Au III purine complexes of this invention may be obtained and Example 12 describes the protocols used to evaluate their efficacy in mice. However, said examples are illustrative onl and this invention should not be construed as being limited thereto because it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill that obvious modifications may be effected and functionally equivalent regents may be substituted for those recited therei without departing from the spirit or scope of this invention. EXAtIPLE 1 Gold 7 chloroethvltheophylline Complex 1.97g of HAuCl4 31120 Engelhard was dissolved in 50 ml of methanol and 2.43 g of 7 chloroethyltheophylline Aldrich was added to the solution with stirring. The resulting light yellow solution was warmed to 600C for 2 hours and then cooled slowly to room temperature. After further cooling for 1 hour at ca. 40C, the resulting orange yellow crystals were removed by filtration and washed with methanol.The yield, after vacuum drying, was 2.9g 68.9 . The elemental analysis data for the 7 chloroethyltheophylline CET complex suggests that the complex contains two theophylline molecules per gold atom. The best formulation, based on this data, is one that contains one CET as the HC1 salt plus one water and one methanol of crystallization. This CET RC1 moiety may he either free, as CET RC1 of crystallization, or bound, as a second ligand coordinated to the gold aton. Anal.

EXAMPLE 2 Gold 7 2,3 dihydroxypropyl theophylline Complex 3.94g of HAuCl4 31120 Engelhard was dissolved in 200 ml of methanol and 2.55g of 7 2,3 dihydroxypropyl theophylline Aldrich was added to the solution with stirring.The resulting suspension was heated to 600C for 3 hours and filtered to remove 2.5g of a yellow solid. A second crop, 1.7g, was obtained by filtration after cooling the above filtrate for 10 hours at ca. 50C. The calculated total yield was 49 . The 7 2,3 dihydroxypropyl theophylline DHPT complex appears to be a dihydrate containing both protonated deprotonated DHPT ligands. Anal. Calcd. forAuC20H33N8Cl4O10 Au, 22.29 C, 27.16 H, 3.76 N, 12.67 Cl, 16.33. Found Au, 22,00 C, 26.97 H, 3.26 N, 12.71 Cl, 16.33. The IR spectra of both theophylline analogs are presented in Figures 1 and 2. While the IR spectra cannot be used to determine how the ligands are coordinated to the gold atom in these complexes, the spectra suggest that the two compounds are structurally similar.

This inoculum is freshly prepared using transfer mice which have been injected with tumor cells the previous week. This inoculum is the end product of a series of steps which involves 1 the removal of the cells from the peritoneal cavity of the sacrificed transfer mouse, 2 alternate centrifugationwashing 2 3 times with cold saline to remove occasional blood and other undesirable components, and finally 3 dilution 1 3 of the packed cell volume with saline the final centrifugation being carried out at 1,000 rpm for 2 min. . A cqll count is made on a 2,000 fold dilution of this 1 3 suspension by means of a CoulterCounter.A final dilution to 1 x 10 cells ml. is made based on the averaged count. On day 1, solutions of the test compounds are prepared and the mice injected, with each mouse of a set of six being injected with the same test compound at the same dose level. Also, on this day, two types of controls 6 mice se are employed 1 Normal 1 set 0.5 ml. of the solvent medium used for the test compound, and 2 Positive control 1 set a known anti tumor agent cis Pt NH3 2Cl2 in saline at 8 mg. kg. , used to test the response of the biological system. The effectiveness of a compound is measured in te2 of the increase in life span ILS of the test animals relative to the controls calculated from the day of tumor inoculation day zero . In order to stanGardize the test data and permit intercomparisons to be made, the day of evaluation is arbitrarily taken as that day corresponding to twice the mean life span or average day of death of the normal controls. This sets a practical upper limit of 100 on the ILS attainable. For calculation purposes, survivors on the day of evaluation are considered to have died on that day. The ILS is formulated as . ILS 1 x 100 ILS values above 50 represent significant activity those above 75 represent excellent activity. Sarcoma 180 ascites antitumor screeninq data for the gold purine complexes described in Examples 1 and 2 are given in Table 1.

Both the CET and DHPT complexes are soluble in water to the extent of at least 64 mg 5 ml and are stable, at least with respect to reduction, in solution for ca. 24 hours. Most of the previously prepared gold compounds were insoluble in water those which could be solublized very quickly underwent reduction to Au I in solution. These compounds are also of great interest because the contain ligands similar to the biologically important purines.It may be possible to utilize this to facilitate drug transport to DNA, their presumed site of action. The 7 chloroethyltheophylline ligand also contains a structural feature common in the alkylating agents, another important class of antitumor agents.
