# Loading apparatus for differential band brake.

## Abstract
A differential brake band 42 has independent spring loading 47, 48 at each end so that changes in the differential braking force ratio can be conveniently effected by changing to springs of different strength such as are readily available on the commercial market, rather than by changing the parameters of other portions of the apparatus of types not so readily available.
