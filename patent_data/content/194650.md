## Description
The present invention relates to a magnetic head, especially a magnetic head applied to a medium for high density recording. Ferrite is conventionally used as a material for a magnetic head core, because it has superior workability and resistance to wear, however its saturated magnetic flux density Bs is 35 50 lower than that of alloy materials. The saturation magnetization, Bs, of the material of head core becomes a problem when the ferrite is used as materials for a head core for a medium of high density high coercive force recording, and from that point of view, a sendust or an amorphous alloy are used as core materials for a medium of high density recording. When such alloys are used as materials for a magnetic head core, the specific resistance of the materials are as low as 70 120 µΩ cm, so that the loss of eddy current is large and the magnetic characteristics of the magnetic head formed as the bulk shape is insufficient in the high frequency region. As a result, an amorphous alloy or a sendust for the core material are produced as ribbons by the melt quenching method. The ribbon is layered on both sides by a non magnetic substrate material with superior resistance to wear. On the other hand, high densification or narrowing of the tracks makes it difficult to work with such ribbon by machine and creates many problems in manufacturing. Accordingly, the best method among the conventional methods for producing a magnetic head is to form a thin film sore material on a non magnetic substrate by a thin film manufacturing method such as a vapor deposition or sputtering. Furthermore, by using such a thin film core material as a magnetic head with high frequency applications preventing the eddy current loss, laminate type core material mutually formed from the magnetic material and the insulating material, can easily be obtained. However, the difference between the thermal expansion coefficient of the magnetic material and the non magnetic substrate causes the following problems. First, since the thermal expansion coefficient of the sendust alloy is as large as about 150 10 ⁷ Accordingly, a polycrystalline or single crystalline Mn Zn ferrite material is used as an amorphous alloy substrate material because the thermal expansion coefficient coincides with that of the substrate material the latter has thermal expansion coefficient is 110 120 10 ⁷ As shown in FIG.1, the prior art arrangement has a magnetic material 3 sandwiched between layers of ferrite 1, and glass 2 is used to fill up the areas near the gap 4 in place of the ferrite 1. By such an arrangement the magnetic head can get an effective play back signal, however, as the ferrite exhibits deterioration in the S N ratio from the alloy material caused by the large degree of running noise the magnetic head shown in FIG.1 also has the same effects, although there is no ferrite near the gap portion. Furthermore, a complex process is necessary for making such a magnetic head. Another prior art arrangement of the magnetic head which excludes the ferrite on the tape running surface so as to make use of the characteristics of the metal materials, is proposed disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication JP A 58 14313, etc. . As shown in FIG.2, the tape running surface on which the gap 7 is formed, is composed of a metal magnetic material 6 and a non magnetic substrate material 5. As a non magnetic substrate material 5, glass is generally used. The normal glass containing sodium or potassium can be used as the glass material, but is not suitable for use with the amorphous alloy, because the resistance to wear is inferior and the thermal expansion coefficient is low. Recently, the use of photo sensitive crystallized glass has been proposed. Therein, the main components such as LiO or SiO₂ are crystallized by exposure to light. Such materials are adopted as substrate materials because such materials have nearly the same thermal expansion coefficients as that of an amorphous alloy, and a resistance to wear is superior. On the other hand, use of the ceramic substrate containing CaO SrO TiO₂ disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication JP A 52 57218 , the ceramic substrate containing NiMnO₂ disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication JP A 53 16399 or the ceramic substrate containing MgO TiO₂ disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication JP A 58 139322 as the substrate material have been proposed. These substrate materials can have various thermal expansion coefficients selectable in wide range by controlling their composition. The crystallized glass or the ceramic substrates containing CaO SrO TiO₂ are, however, chemically unstable due to alkaline metals or Ca as components, so that the characteristics of the resultant magnetic head become inferior by adhering magnetic powder on the substrate surface during the running of the magnetic tape or the like in case of constituting the magnetic head by using such substrate. The ceramic substrate containing NiMnO₂ has the disadvantages of high manufacturing cost, poor grindability, and low working efficiency in working to a usable shape, because MnO easily changes to Mn₂O₃ by oxidization. The magnetic powder from the magnetic tape does not adhere to the substrate surface. On the other hand, the above mentioned problems are not encounted in using a ceramic substrate containing MgO TiO₂. When the thermal expansion coefficient of the ceramic substrate is over 95 10 ⁷ Considering the above mentioned prior art together, the substrate material for the magnetic head is required to have the following characteristics. Accordingly, the purpose of the present invention is to provide an improved magnetic head for a medium for high density recording, and especially to a magnetic head comprising a substrate material having characteristics of an equal or near thermal expansion coefficient to that of metal, superior machine workability, superior resistance to wear, non magnetization, non adherance of magnetic powder thereon from magnetic tape and chemical and thermal stability. A magnetic head in accordance with the present invention comprising A preferred embodiment of a magnetic head in accordance with the present invention is described in reference to the manufacturing process shown in FIG.3. A substrate material 8 is made by sintering α Fe₂O₃ by a hot isostatic pressing process. The thermal expansion coefficient of such substrate material is 110 10 ⁷ After that, as shown in FIG.3B, substrate material 10 is put upon the substrate material 8 so that the amorphous alloy film 9 faces to the glass layer 11, and then they are bonded by heating to make core blocks 12 and 12 . Then a coil window 13 is formed on one of such core blocks 12 or 12 . A gap spacer film 14 and a bonding glass film 15 are formed on necessary part of core blocks 12 and 12 by using a thin film manufacturing technique such as sputtering or the like. As shown in FIG.3C, such core blocks 12 and 12 are bonded by heating, facing the above mentioned gap spacer film 14 to glass film 15. In this case, a bonding glass 16 on the top of the coil window 13 is melted down at the same time. As mentioned above, a gap 17 which is necessary for magnetic head is formed, as shown in FIG.3D. By cutting the deposited core blocks as prescribed thickness of the core along the cutting line 18 and 18 , and by forming a tape running surface 19, the head chip is completed, as shown in FIG.3D and FIG.3E. Table 1 shows the result of experiment for cutting the core blocks to the prescribed thickness in the process shown in FIG.3D. For information, the result of experiment for cutting the core head of ferrite substrate and crystallized glass substrate, which are shown in FIG.1 and FIG.2, are shown at the same time. The size of these head and the condition of cutting are all the same. As shown in table 1, the substrate material of the present invention and the Mn Zn substrate material were able to be cut under the condition of accelerating the cutting speed, but in case of the crystallized glass substrate material, cutting was impossible due to the head breaking out on the gap surface or when the spindle motor stops. When measuring the load current of the spindle motor under the condition that the cutting speed was 20 mm minute in which every substrate material of the magnetic head can be cut, the load currents of cutting the substrate material of the present invention and the Mn Zn substrate material were equal, but the load current of cutting the crystallized glass substrate material was five times as large as that of the present invention. Now, let us normalize the load current of cutting of the substrate material of the present invention standardized as 1. As mentioned above, the crystallized glass substrate material was inferior in machine workability, and the substrate material of the present invention had superior workability of the same as that of ferrite. Table 2 shows the measuring result of C N characteristics and out put of the magnetic heads of such substrate materials in case of installing these magnetic heads on the video tape recorder relative velocity of the head and the tape was 3.8 m second and running the metal particulate tape on market, under the condition that the temperature was is 23 Furthermore, table 2 shows the output of the magnetic heads under the condition that the temperature was 23 As shown in table 2, the magnetic head of the Mn Zn substrate was inferior by 2dB in the characteristic of C N because of the occurring of the rubbing noise. And also, under the condition of 23 FIG.4 shows the wear of several magnetic heads composed of different substrate materials compared with that of Mn Zn single crystalline ferrite as a function of running time. The wear of the magnetic head of the crystallized glass substrate was the heaviest, next the magnetic head of ferrite substrate, and the resistance wear of the magnetic head of the present invention was the highest and it was nearly equal to that of Mn Ze single crystalline ferrite. The wear of the magnetic head of ferrite substrate was larger than that of Mn Zn single crystalline ferrite, because the gap portion of the former was constituted by the glass and the resistance to wear of the glass was inferior to that of ferrite. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the substrate is made of sintered α Fe₂O₃ by hot isostatic pressing, but the most preferable one is of single crystalline α Fe₂O₃. The crystallographic axis of the single crystal is constant, and so the wear in tape running occurs uniformly, and the surface roughing is very little. And in the single crystalline α Fe₂O₃, the thermal expansion coefficients of axis of A and C are different by about 20 10 ⁷ The single crystalline α Fe₂O₃, however, is not yet manufactured in large size and large quantity as single crystalline Mn Zn, partly because of the restriction of the manufacturing apparatus in the existing technology, so that it is produced only in the laboratory. The poly crystal having the orientated crystallographic axis is the next preferable substrate. The mold body having orientated C axis is easily obtained by wet type forming using α Fe₂O₃ powder with a shape of hexagonal plate as the starting material. And by sintering such a mold body, a sintered body having an orientated C axis is obtained. Furthermore, by cutting such sintered body along the orientation, it has the effect near the single crystal in using the substrate. The sintered body of α Fe₂O₃ is most easily and inexpensively manufactured by using α Fe₂O₃ or γ FeOOH as starting material and forming it in a predetermined shape, sintering and densifying the formed body. The higher the density of such formed body is, the more dense such sintered body is in such case. A normal sintering method, hot pressing method, hot isostatic pressing method or any suitable combination of these methods may be used for densifying the above mentioned poly crystal. When considering the surface roughing caused by the difference between the crystallographic axis in tape running or chipping in machine working, the crystal grains in the sintered body and the number of polocity should be as small as possible. Accordingly, the hot isostatic pressing method is the best. The other elements adding to the impurity level against the α Fe₂O₃ contained in the starting material, for example adding of Al₂O₃ or the like for adjusting the thermal expansion coefficient, or adding of ZrO₂ or the like for increasing strength of intergranular, are quite permissible. Further, the existence of the small amount of wustite FeO , or magnetite Fe₃O₄ which are retained or segregated in α Fe₂O₃ by varieties of starting materials or sintering conditions, is not a problem, if the obtained sintered body has non magnetic character permitted in the practical use. The soft magnetic metal films composed of metal metal elements such as Co M where M is a metal element such as Nb, Ti, Ta, Zr, W or the like or Co M₁ M₂ M₁, M₂ are the metal element mentioned above , which shows high magnetic permeability and has larger saturation magnetization than that of Mn Zn single crystalline ferrite, is perferable for an amorphous alloy metal film, because its resistance to wear is superior than that of the films composed of metal and metalloid elements such as Co Fe Si B or Ni Si B. However the Co Fe Si B or Ni Si B films are also available, if the films are sandwiched with the substrate of the present invention. The method of forming such an amorphous alloy film is not limited to the sputtering method, and the vapor deposition method and ribbon type amorphous arrangement formed by the melt quenching method can be used. The bonding of the substrate materials 8 and 10 or the bonding of the core blocks 12 and 12 are practiced under the conditions of working temperatures lower than the crystallization temperature of the amorphous magnetic alloy film, and using a low melting temperature head glass. In the magnetic head produced by the bonding of a magnetic material and a substrate material by an organic adhesive, other magnetic metal film such as the sendust alloy can be used. As mentioned above, the present embodiment is described by using the amorphous alloy film of a single layer structure, but use of a laminated type core, wherein a magnetic material and an insulating material are alternately laminated, is far superior to prevent eddy current loss. Further other materials for the substrate of the magnetic head in accordance with the present invention are explained as follows. After measuring the MgO, NiO, and TiO₂, and mixing for sixteen hours in a ball mill using alcohol as the dispersion medium, the mixture is dried at a temperature of 150 Table 3 shows the measured result of such ceramic substrates. Next, selecting a substrate comprising 75 mol MgO, 13 mol NiO and 12 mol TiO₂, having thermal expansion coefficient of 114 X 10 ⁷ C, and an amorphous magnetic metal film containing Co Zr is formed on the surface of the substrate by the sputtering, the magnetic heads were made in accordance with the method shown in FIG.3 A to FIG.3 E . For the comparison, magnetic heads made of the substrate of the crystallized glass, ceramic substrate containing NiMnO₂, and ceramic substrate containing MgO TiO₂, are made in the same manner. The change of output of the magnetic heads, the resistances to wear and the temperature and moisture stability were performed by actually running the metal particulate tape on the surface of running surface of each magnetic heads under various conditions. As a result, after several hours had passed from the start of measuring, under the conditions of a 20 C temperature and 50 humidity, the differences in characteristics depending on the variety of substrate were not observed. But under the conditions of a 20 C temperature and 10 humidity, the output level of the magnetic head made of the crystallized glass substrate was decreased by several dB, adherence of the metal powder from the magnetic tape on the substrate surface. Further, under the condition of 40 C temperature and 80 humidity, the output of the magnetic head was decreased by 2 3 dB by the segregated MgO , and a step is produced on the surface of the head depending on the diameter of the grain. After about 100 hours had passed, under the conditions of 20 C temperature and 80 humidity, with a magnetic head made of a substrate containing MgO TiO₂, the above mentioned segregated MgO was produced, and the output of the magnetic head was decreased by several dB. The magnetic head made with substrates containing NiMnO₂, exhibited a difference in the resistances to wear of the substrate and of the soft magnetic amorphous alloy, and therefore a step was produced on the surface of the head, and the output of the magnetic head was decreased. In contrast the magnetic head in accordance with the present invention made the substrate of Mgo NiO TiO₂, under a variety of temperature and moisture conditions, the adherence and melting of the magnetic powder and the like do not take place, and the matching of resistances to wear between the substrate and the soft magnetic amorphous alloy was good, and the change of the output of the magnetic head was 1dB. After about 100 hours of the magnetic tape running, offset wear of the substrate and the soft magnetic amorphous alloy on the tape running surface of the magnetic head were measured by the surface measuring instrument, and the results are shown also in table 3. The amount of offset wear in table 3, means the depth of concave surface of the magnetic material compared with flat surface of the substrate material. Table 3 shows that the thermal expansion coefficient is increased in proportion with the increase in the total quantity of Mgo and NiO, and it is greater when the quantity of NiO is greater provided that the total quantity is constant. On the other hand, the specific grinding energy also shows the same tendency, but in the region where the component is 96 mol or a smaller quantity of NiO and 2 mol or greater quantity of MgO is used, the specific grinding energy was sufficiently smaller than that of crystallized glass or ceramic substrate containing NiMnO₂, and the maximum value thereof is only 1 2 of that of the crystallized glass or ceramic substrate. For water proofness, the surface roughness Rmax which is nearly equal to 2000 Å was obtained for the substrate containing NiO of less than 2 mol , but in the substrate containing NiO of over 2 mol , the maximum surface roughness Rmax is less than 300 Å. As mentioned above, for water proofness, over 2 mol of the quantity of NiO is sufficient. On the contrary, the specific grinding energy increases in proportion to the increase of the quantity of NiO, and the quantity of NiO should be as small as possible in the region over 2 mol . Considering the controlability of the thermal expansion coefficient, the best region is 5 30 mol . And also, for the quantity of TiO₂, considering the specific grinding energy, the region of 5 50 mol is desirable. Furthermore, for the offset wear of the magnetic material and the substrate, the condition of large quantity of MgO and the little quantity of NiO is advantageous. Considering the spacing loss between the tape and the magnetic head, under 100 Å of the offset wear is tolerable. Considering all of the above mentioned, for the substrate material of the magnetic head, the ceramics containing 57 96 mol of MgO, 2 41 mol of NiO, and 2 41 mol of TiO₂ is desirable, and especially the ceramics containing 70 93 mol of Mgo, 2 25 mol of NiO, and 5 2B mol of TiO₂ is more desirable. The above mentioned embodiment showed use of amorphous soft magnetic film containing Co Zr, having thermal expansion of 114 10 ⁷ C coefficient, but the soft magnetic materials are not limited to this. Namely, for any magnetic core materials such as amorphous other component, alloys or compound such as permalloy, sendust or the like, or Mn Zn ferrite, optimum substrate materials can be provided by controlling contents of MgO, NiO and TiO₂ responding to the thermal expansion coefficient of the magnetic core materials. The substrate material used in of the present invention contains MgO, NiO and TiO₂ as the main components, and small amounts of ZrO₂, SiO₂ and the like for improving the machine workability and the sintering qualities, and further, necessary impurities may be contained in the material. As mentioned above, in the magnetic head of the present invention, the thermal expansion coefficient of the substrate material and the magnetic metal material are substantially accorded, and therefore the magnetic film can be made by using known thin film making apparatus, and the glass can be bonded thereto. Furthermore the machine workability and the resistance to wear of the substrate material are superior, and the output of the magnetic head is stable because there is no adhering of magnetic powder of the magnetic tape thereto, so that a very high reliability of the magnetic head can be obtained.
