# Method and apparatus for determining the applied voltage at which Paschen breakdown occurs in electrography.

## Abstract
In electrographic printing Paschen breakdown must be exceeded for writing to occur, or the Paschen breakdown level can be used as a measure of the suitability of record media for use in such printing. The onset of Paschen breakdown is determined by the appearance or disappearance of second harmonic current flow across a test gap 49 . The D C output of an integrator 50 rises until the onset of Paschen breakdown occurs caused by the combination of the D C output and a sinusoidal voltage from an osciliator 43 .
