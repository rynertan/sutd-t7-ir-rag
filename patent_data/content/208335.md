## Description
This invention relates to a new anti vertigo drug containing as an active ingredient 6 amino 2 fluoromethyl 3 o tolyl 4 3H quinazolinone or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. It is known that vertigo is abnormality of integration mechanisms of information in central nervous system resulting from rapid disfunction of equilibrium nervous system occurred in vestibular nervous system and it is accompanied with various symptoms such as desesthesia of motion and position, nystagmus, disequilibrium, head deviation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, salivation or tachycardia. For the prophylaxis and treatment of the vertigo, there have been proposed various drugs, such as anticholinergic drugs, tranquillizers, anti histaminics, sedatives, vasodilators e.g. cinnarizine , or antiemetics e.g. diphenidol . Japan J. Pharmacol. Volume 32, 1982, pages 427 438 discloses the pharmacological use of AFLOQUALONE as a centrally acting muscle relaxant which may inhibit respiration, lower arterial blood pressure, decrease heart rate and slightly increase femoral and renal arterial blood flow in parallel with hypotension. The present inventors have intensively studied to improve anti vertigo drugs and have now found that 6 amino 2 fluoromethyl 3 o tolyl 4 3H quinazolinone hereinafter referred to as Afloqualone or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt is useful as an anti vertigo drug. An object of the invention is to provide a novel anti vertigo drug containing as an active ingredient Afloqualone or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. The anti vertigo drug of this invention comprises as an active ingredient Afloqualone or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof and exhibits excellent activity inhibiting vestibular nystagmus and hence is useful for the prophylaxis and treatment of abnormality of reflex system of vestibulo equibrium sense. The activities of Afloqualone or a salt thereof had been confirmed by experiments. For instance, Afloqualone was orally administered to cats dose 10 mg kg and its inhibitory effects on frequency, duration and maximum amplitude of per rotatory nystagmus or post rotatory nystagmus wore measured 30 to 180 minutes after administration of the drug to be tested. As a result, in per rotatory nystagmus, the frequency, duration and amplitude of nystagmus were inhibited at maximum about 90 , 88 and 80 , respectively. Besides, in post rotatory nystagmus, the frequency, duration and amplitude of nystagmus were inhibited at maximum about 86 , 80 and 78 , respectively. Moreover, in case of a dose of 5 mg kg, Afloqualone could inhibited the frequency and duration of per rotatory nustagmus at maximum about 62 and 56 , respectively and further inhibited the amplitude of post rotatory nystagmus at maximum about 52 . In view of the action on sleep wakefulness cycle, electroencephalogical study and also action against EEG arousal response induced by stimulation of the brain stem reticular formation, it is unlikely that the inhibition of nystagmus by Afloqualone is based on the lowering action of consciousness at the above mentioned dose. Besides, as is clear from the fact that Afloqualone could inhibit vestibular nystagmus at a dose of about ¼ 5 mg kg, p.o. in mice of ED₅₀ about 20 mg kg, p.o. in mice for muscular relaxation action thereof, Afloqualone shows high specificity on equilibrium function in addition to the action in muscle controlling system, and hence, it can be used for the prophylaxis and treatment of various symptoms such as desesthesia of motion and position, nystagmus, disequilibrium, head deviation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, salivation or tachycardia. Thus, Afloqualone has excellent nystagmus inhibitory activity and is useful as an anti vertigo drug and also useful for the prophylaxis and treatment of various diseases accompanied with abnormality in reflex system of verstibulo equilibrium sense. Afloqualone can also be used in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof as an anti vertigo drug. The salt includes inorganic acid addition salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide or sulfate , and organic acid addition salts such as aromatic sulfonic acid addition salts e.g. benzenesulfonate or toluenesulfonate or alkylsulfonic acid addition salts e.g. methanesulfonate or ethanesulfonate . Afloqualone or a salt thereof can also be used in admixture with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents which are suitable for oral or parenteral administration. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and diluents include, for example, gelatin, lactose, glucose, sodium chloride, starches, magnesium stearate, talc or vegetable oils. The active ingredient may be used in the form of conventional pharmaceutical preparations, for instance, solid preparations such as tablets, sugar tablets, pills or capsules and liquid preparations such as solutions, suspensions or emulsions. These preparations are usually sterilized and may be incorporated by other conventional additives such as stabilizers, wetting agents or emulsifiers. When Afloqualone or a salt thereof is used as an anti vertigo drug, it can be administered by the oral or parenteral route e.g. intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection . It is preferably administered orally. The dose of Afloqualone or a salt thereof may vary depending on the age, weight or conditions of patients or severity of disease, but is usually in the range of 0.05 to 10 mg kg day, preferably 0.1 to 2 mg kg day. Moreover, Afloqualone has low toxicity the acute toxicity LD₅₀ 528.0 mg kg, p.o. in mice and hence is very safe as an anti vertigo drug. The pharmacological activities of Afloqualone or a salt thereof are illustrated by the following Experiment. The experiment was carried out by using cats weighing 1.9 3.5 kg, one group 4 6 animals to which a cannula was inserted into the trachea under ether anesthesia. The nystagmus was induced at an interval of 30 minutes, and after the third induction, a solution or suspension of a test compound in 0.5 carboxymethyl cellulose solution was orally administered. In the control group, 0.5 carboxymethyl cellulose solution was administered instead of the test compound. Based on the diagram thus obtained, the frequency, duration and the maximum amplitude of per rotatory nystagmus and post rotatory nystagmus were calculated. The anti vertigo activity of test compound is shown by the inhibitory ratio to that in the control group which is calculated by the following equations. The results are shown in the following Tables 1 to 3. The preparation of the invention is illustrated by the following Example. Tablets are prepared by the following formulation. The above ingredients are mixed and kneaded, and then the mixture is tabletted by a conventional method to give tablets 100 mg per tablet .
