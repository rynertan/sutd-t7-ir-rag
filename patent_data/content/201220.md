## Description
PROCESS This invention relates to a process for selective dechlorination of waste gases containing hydrogen chloride and sulphur dioxide. Since coal may contain up to about 2 wt or more of sulphur compounds, the furnace flue gases from a coalburning furnace may contain significant amounts of sulphur dioxide. In view of the increasing worldwide concern regarding the harmful effects on the environment of acidic gaseous pollutants, particularly sulphur dioxide, there is increasing pressure by way of legislation to control the emission of sulphur dioxide by power stations, other large coal fired plants, petroleum refining operations and waste incineration. To this end, various processes have been developed for removal of sulphur dioxide from flue gases, including the Wellman Lord SO2 recovery process, the magnesium oxide based SO2 absorption processes, the dual alkali SO2 absorption processes, and the limestone limegypsum SO2 absorption processes. Further information regarding the Wellman Lord S02 recovery process can be obtained from the publication An Update of the Wellman Lord Flue Gas ScrubbingProcess , Institution of Chemical Engineers SymposiumSeries 72 1982 , and from US A 3607037, US A 3653812, USA 3790660, GB A 1557294 and GB A 1557295. A description of the magnesium oxide based SO2 absorption processes will be found, for example, in Appendix G of NATO CCMS FlueGas Desulphurization Pilot Study Phase II ApplicabilityStudy , prepared by R.L. Torstrick et al for United StatesEnvironmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. 20460,United States of America May 1980 .The dual alkali SO2 absorption process is discussed in the Summary Report EPA 625 8 80 004 Sulfur Oxides Control Technology Series Flue Gas Desulfurization Dual Alkali Process published by Industrial Environmental Research Laboratory, Research Triangle Park NC 27711, United States of America October 1980 . An example of a publication describing the limestone lime gypsum SO2 absorption process is GB A1505281. Coal from some sources may contain, in addition to sulphurous impurities, a significant proportion of chlorine e.g. up to about 1 wt or more which normally appears in the stack or furnace gases from a coal burning furnace in the form of hydrogen chloride. In many 502 absorption processes HCl is a problem because, unless first removed from the flue gas, it can lead to increased corrosion in and inefficiency of the SO2 absorption plant.Thus, for example, in a Wellman Lord SO2 recovery plant, it is usual to pretreat the flue gas using a water washing step which cools and saturates the gas, and removes the majority of the HC1 present, prior to the SO2 removal step, as well as scrubbing out most of the fly ash. HCl removal is particularly important when the coal being burnt has a chlorine content of at least about 0.1 wt .When the coal has a low chlorine content, a water prewashing step is an effective expedient, prior to SO2 removal, and the quantity of acidic effluent produced can be minimised by recirculating the scrubbing water.However, when the coal has a high chlorine content, for example a coal containing at least about 0.4 wt chlorine and 2 wt sulphur, the flue gases may contain, for example, about 0.144 vol SO2 and about 0.029 vol BC1, and water washing is uneconomical and creates a further disposal problem on account of the large volume of dilute hydrochloric acid that is produced. Since the vapour pressure in equilibrium with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution is dependent on the HCl concentration in the solution, there is an upper limit to the concentration of HC1 in the recirculating scrubbing liquor that can be tolerated in order to achieve the desired degree of HC1 removal. In practice, about 1 wt HC1 solution is as strong an acid as can be tolerated for use in the washing pre treatment step of a Wellman Lord S02 recovery plant.Thus, if water washing were used, for example, for HC1 removal prior to SO2 recovery by theWellman Lord process from a flue gas from a 2000 MW power station burning a high chlorine content coal e.g. a coal containing about 0.4 wt chlorine , there would be generated approximately 2,000,000 U.S. gallons day 7.5 million litres day of 1 wt HC1 solution, the disposal of which would represent a considerable problem to the power station operator since it cannot simply be discharged to the environment and is too dilute to be generally useful. In EP A 0046387 there is proposed a process for the selective removal of hydrogen halide from a gas containing the same comprising intimately contacting the gas with an aqueous liquor containing a water soluble halide, such as an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal halide, dissolved therein whose pH lies in the range from about 0.1 to about 3.0. Amongst water soluble halides that can be used in the process of EP A 0046387 there are mentioned calcium chloride, calcium bromide and calcium iodide. The pH is said to lie preferably in the range of from about 0.1 to about 2.5, for example in the range of from about 1.5 to about 2.0. For selective removal of HCl from a gas containing, for example, a mixture of SO2 and HC1, there is recommended use of an aqueous liquor containing from about 3 wt to about 70 wt of calcium chloride.Control of the pH in this case can be achieved by adding lime to the circulating liquor. There results a calcium chloride solution, with a typical concentration of about 30 wt , which can be evaporated to about 70 wt calcium chloride and converted to calcium chloride flake. A further description of this process will be found in a paper entitled Selective Absorption of Hydrogen Chloride from Flue Gases in the Presence ofSulfur Dioxide by W.S. Kyte et al, EnvironmentalProgress, Vol. 3, No. 3, pages 183 to 187 August 1984 . DE A 2808364 teaches use of a circulating liquor whose pH is controlled between 0.5 and 2.5 and contains, in addition to chloride ions, also calcium ions and carbonic acid CO2 . According to this proposal HC1 is selectively removed from the flue gas without simultaneously removing SO2. Salt concentrations up to about 30 can be achieved. GB A 1560038 proposes removal of chloride ions from flue gas containing SO2 by simultaneous absorption of both SO2 and the chlorine containing impurities onto solid magnesium oxide in the form of a circulating slurry, followed by separation of the solids, calcining to release SO, and HC1, water washing of the gases released to remove HCI, and treatment of the remaining gases to recover S or 112 SO4 therefrom. In the processes of EP A 0046387 and DE A2808364, a problem may arise due to a formation of encrustations on the walls of the plant and blockage of valves and spray nozzles. Such encrustations can be extremely difficult to remove once formed. In addition, although the processes of EP A0046387 and of DE A 2808364 obviate the production of large volumes of useless dilute hydrochloric acid solutions from flue gas desulphurisation plants, the byproduct from such processes, i.e. more or less concentrated solutions of calcium chloride or calcium chloride flake, have limited usefulness and may represent a disposal problem for the operator of a coal fired power station. The only way of disposing of such concentrated solutions of calcium chloride or crystalline solid calcium chloride may be dumping on land or at sea, either of which expedients constitutes an additional expense and possibly an additional environmental problem for the power station operator. There is accordingly a need to provide an improved process for selective dechlorination of HC1 andSO2 containing flue gases which will avoid the problem of formation of encrustations in the HC1 removal pretreatment section of the plant. There is also a need to provide an improved process for removal of HC1 and SO2 from flue gases which will result in more useful byproducts. The invention accordingly seeks to provide an improved process for selective dechlorination of HC1 andSO2 containing flue gases which yields commercially desirable by products and which is free from the risk of encrustation in the HC1 removal pre treatment section. According to the present invention there is provided a process for selective dechlorination of a flue gas containing both HC1 and SO2 which comprises washing the flue gas in a pre treatment zone with a circulating aqueous absorption liquor having a pH of from about 0.1 to about 2.2 and containing magnesium chloride dissolved therein, controlling the pH of the circulating liquor by controlled addition of a magnesium containing pH control agent, and controlling the magnesium chloride content of the said circulating liquor by withdrawing from the circulation path of the aqueous absorption liquor a purge stream of magnesium chloride containing liquor. The treated flue gas from the pre treatment zone can then be subjected to a desulphurisation step.using a conventional desulphurisation process, such as theWellman Lord SO2 recovery process, or one of the magnesium oxide based SO2 absorption processes, the dual alkali SO2 absorption processes, or the limestone lime gypsum SO2 absorption processes. Preferably the pH of the circulating liquor lies in the range of from about 1.0 to about 1.5. The invention contemplates use of a circulating absorption liquor containing magnesium chloride as the sole essential solute and in which the pH control agent is selected from magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, and mixtures of two or more thereof.In the circulating liquor the concentration of magnesium chloride is preferably from about 1 wt up to about 40 wt , and more preferably lies in the range of from about 10 wt to about 35 wt . The invention further envisages use of a circulating absorption liquor containing both magnesium chloride and calcium chloride. Thus according to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for selective dechlorination of a flue gas containing both HC1 and SO2 which comprises washing the flue gas in a pre treatment zone with a circulating aqueous absorption liquor having a pH of from about 0.1 to about 2.2 and containing a mixture of magnesium chloride and calcium chloride dissolved therein and having a predetermined magnesium calcium molar ratio, controlling the pH of the circulating liquor by controlled addition of a pH control agent thereto, which pH control agent contains both magnesium and calcium in said predetermined magnesium calcium molar ratio, and controlling the content of magnesium chloride and of calcium chloride in the circulating liquor by withdrawing from the circulation path of the aqueous absorption liquor a purge stream of said liquor. The pH of the circulating liquor in this case preferably lies in the range of from about 0.8 to about 2.0. In such a process the pH control agent may comprise a mixture of at least one magnesium containing material selected from magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide and magnesium carbonate and at least one calcium containing material selected from calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate. In such a process the predetermined magnesium calcium molar ratio may range from about 1 10 to about 10 1, but is preferably in the range of from about 2 1 to about 1 2 and even more preferably is about 1 1.Hence there can be used as the pH control agent in such a process any of a wide variety of naturally occurring dolomites which contain both magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate in varying ratios, but typically in a 1 1 molar ratio. Alternatively a natural dolomite could be used in the calcined state. The concentration of the mixture of magnesium and calcium chlorides may vary within wide limits, e.g.from about 1 wtZ up to about 50 wt . Preferably it is in the range of from about 10 wt to about 35 wt . When the circulating absorption liquor contains magnesium chloride alone, there can be contemplated for use as the magnesium containing pH control agent natural magnesite MgCO3 , natural brucite Mg OH 2 or one of the calcined forms of one of these materials. Absorption is conveniently effected at a temperature in the range of from about 400C to about 950 C. The resulting purge solution is rich in magnesium and is a useful feed material for magnesium production processes and thus does not pose a disposal problem for the operator of a coal fired power station.The presence of calcium ions in the purge solution is no disadvantage for this end use. Moreover, as the purge solution has a commercial value and is not an unwanted byproduct, its disposal does not add to the operating costs of the power station indeed the cost of flue gas desulphurisation can be offset, at least to some extent, by sale of the purge solution to a magnesium producer. It is a further advantage of the present invention that no encrustations are formed in the pretreatment zone where HC1 removal is effected. Such encrustations can arise in the operation of plants using the processes of EP A 0046387 and of DE A 2808364 and are caused, it is believed by the applicants, by precipitation of calcium sulphate gypsum as a result of formation of sulphate ions in the absorption solution, either by absorption of traces of sulphur trioxide from the flue gas or by oxidation of sulphite or bisulphite ions. When the circulating absorption liquor contains magnesium chloride alone there is no calcium present to form gypsum and, as magnesium sulphate is very soluble, there is no danger of encrustations being formed.When the circulating absorption liquor contains both magnesium chloride and calcium chloride, the solubility of sulphate is enhanced, due to the solubility of magnesium sulphate, and hence the problem of gypsum deposition is substantially avoided or minimised. Magnesium can be produced from sea water, which contains approximately 1200 ppm of magnesium 10 3 by precipitation of magnesium hydroxide with lime, or better with calcined dolomite or dolime , followed by calcining to yield magnesium oxide, which is then converted to the chloride the resulting magnesium chloride is then subjected to electrolysis in the molten state in anhydrous or hydrous form. Such processes are known as the Dow ChemicalSeawater Process and as the Norsk Hydro process, further details of which can be found, for example on page 577 et sea of Volume 14 of Rirk Othmer s Encyclopaedia ofChemical Technology Third Edition . The purge solution from the process of the invention can, as already mentioned, be used as a feed solution for magnesium production in place of sea water.Compared with the conventional sea water processes, the use of the purge solution of the present invention as feed solution has the great advantage for the magnesium producer that the magnesium chloride content is much higher, typically lying in the range of from about 10 wt to about 30 wt , than in sea water. In order that the invention may be clearly understood and readily carried into effect, a preferred form of flue gas desulphurisation plant with a prescrubber section designed to operate using a selective dechlorination process according to the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference toFigure 1 of the accompanying drawings, which is a flow diagram of the plant. Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings, a dirty flue gas from a power station boiler furnace is fed by way of duct 1 to a pre scrubber 2. Adjacent to its inlet is a venturi section 3 which is fitted with an adjustable cone 4 for adjustment of the throat gap. An aqueous chloride liquor is pumped by means of pump 5 through lines 6 and 7 to nozzles 8 through which it is sprayed into the throat of venturi section 3. Additional chloride liquor is passed by way of line 9 to further nozzles 10 mounted in the exit section from pre scrubber 2. Liquor from nozzles 8 and 10 collects in the bottom of pre scrubber 2 to form a pool 12 and is withdrawn therefrom through line 13 to a storage tank 14. The pH of the liquor is monitored by means of pH meter 15 which is arranged to control a valve 16 in line 17. The flue gas gives up its HC1 content to the liquor in passage through pre scrubber 2 and its exit section 11 and is also cooled to a temperature of about 600C in so doing. Fly ash is also removed from the flue gas in passage through pre scrubber 2 and its exit section 11. The gas is then passed through a first demister 18, is washed with make up water supplied from line 19 to nozzles 20, and then passes through a second demister 21 into the clean flue gas main 22 to a conventional Wellman Lord SO2 recovery plant 23. The desulphurised flue gas is vented to atmosphere by way of line 24 and stack 25. The liquor circulated by pump 5 is a 20 wt aqueous solution of an equimolar mixture of magnesium chloride and calcium chloride having a pH of 1.5. It also contains fly ash particles suspended therein. It may further contain traces of sulphate ions. A purge stream is withdrawn from the liquor circulation loop by means of line 26 and is passed through filter 27 to remove fly ash which is discarded as shown by line 28. The resulting ash free liquor is taken by pipe line or by tanker, as indicated by line 29 to the first stage 30 of a magnesium recovery plant in which it is treated by addition of calcined dolomite, supplied in line 31. The resulting precipitated magnesium hydroxide is then taken as indicated by line 32, and calcined and converted to anhydrous magnesium chloride and electrolysed by conventional procedures in the further processing stages 33 of the magnesium production plant to yield magnesium as indicated by line 34. The wash water supplied by nozzles 20 is collected in line 35 and passed to tank 36 to which crushed dolomite is supplied as indicated by line 37.Reference numeral 38 indicates a stirrer fitted in tank 36 for the purpose of producing a dolomite slurry Slurry can be withdrawn from tank 36 in line 39 by means of pump 40 and pumped through lines 41 and 42 back into tank 36 line 17 forms a branch from the slurry circulation loop. In operation of the plant pH meter 15 monitors continuously the pH of the liquor circulated by pump 5 and controls valve 16 to admit dolomite slurry by way of line 17 in order to maintain the pH of the absorption liquor supplied by way of nozzles 8 at a preselected value, e.g.1.5. Purge solution is withdrawn in line 26 at a corresponding rate, thereby maintaining the concentration of calcium chloride and magnesium chloride in the circulating liquor at the preselected value, i.e. 20 wt of the mixture of magnesium chloride and calcium chloride. More than 99 of the HC1 in the flue gas supplied in duct 1 is removed in passage through prescrubber 2 and its exit section 11. In the above description of the illustrated plant the circulating absorption liquor is recommended to contain a mixture of magnesium chloride and calcium chloride. It is also within the purview of the present invention to use a circulating liquor containing magnesium chloride alone. In this case crushed magnesite or crushed brucite can be used in place of the crushed dolomite. Figure 2 illustrates the selective absorption ofHC1 from a gas containing a mixture of HC1 and SO2 into an aqueous liquor containing differing concentrations in wt of an equimolar mixture of CaC12 and MgC12 at different pH values. Figure 3 is a similar graph illustrating selective absorption of HC1 from a gas containing both HC1 and SO2 into an aqueous liquor containing 30 wt MgC12 at different pH values.
