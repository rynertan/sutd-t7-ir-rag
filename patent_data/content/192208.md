## Description
The invention relates to a device for the continuous production of reinforced manufactures articles according to the preamble of claim 1 as well as to a process for the continuous manufacture of the reinforced manufactured articles. A device according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from EP A 21 362, which describes the continuous manufacture of reinforced concrete slabs. Further EP A 116 858 discloses a process for manufacturing cement plates reinforced with fibrillated polymeric films, which process comprises the steps of impregnating net pieces by a cement mix and preliminary degasing the reinforcing net. Manufactured articles, also in the form of plates, consisting of hydraulic binders mixes such as cement, reinforced with open nets of fibrilled synthetic films in particular polyolefinic films, are known from this prior art. Said manufactured articles display high physical mechanical characteristics, more particularly they show a high resistance to bending stresses, a high tensile strenght, high impact resistance, a high fatigue strength, a high resistance to low temperatures and to water permeability and other properties that make these articles particularly suited for use in the building industry. The continuous manufacturing process for such reinforced manufactured articles shows, however, a number of drawbacks that are mainly due to the fact that the incorporation into the hydraulic binder of one or more net shaped structures of the previously mentioned type, each formed by a plurality of superimposed fibrilled polymeric films, hardly leads to a uniform, capillary diffusion of the binder into the net shaped structure. In fact, especially when the manufacturing process is conducted at industrially competitive production rates, there form air bubbles and portions of reinforcing net are not uniformly impregnated. Various processes and devices have been suggested for the preparation of such manufactured articles made with hydraulic binders and reinforced with either metal nets or with fibres or nets of natural, artificial or synthetic polymers. All the considered known devices and processes show, however, several drawbacks which unfavourably reflect on the quality of the produced reinforced plates, whose characteristics turn out to be non homogeneous and rather low grade, with a consequential prejudice to their practical application. More particularly, in the known devices the feeding of the cement at the cement station does not occur uniformly as far as the quantity and the distribution, with respect to the feeding of the reinforcing net, is concerned. Moreover, no account is taken of the air dragged along by the advancing net, while the contact between net and cement is, in general carried out in such a way as not to ensure either the homogeneity of the composite or the correct impregantion of the net by the mix. Thus, there are obtained unhomogeneous composite manufactured articles with poor physical mechanical characteristics. Moreover, no sizing, levelling and superficial finishing systems of the plates are foreseen so as to obtain commercially acceptable products. Lastly, since the contact net mix is only superficial, the air, trapped in the reinforcing structures, is not expelled,wherefore the adhesion between cement matrix and the reinforcing net turns out to be irregular and the structure of the composite article shows discontinuities, both on the surface and inside, due to the inclusion of air bubbles. Thus object of the present invention is that of providing a device that shall allow to carry out the continuous preparation of reinforced manufactured articles based on hydraulic binders at industrially acceptable production rates, without there occuring the above indicated drawbacks. More particularly, object of the present invention is that of providing a device that shall allow to produce in a continuous way reinforced manufactured articles based on hydraulic binders of a high regularity and homogeneity and displaying high physical mechanical characteristics. This object is achieved by the features in the characterizing part of claim 1. The stations for the formation of the superimposed layers are at least two, but preferably are comprised between three and ten. The reinforced net feeder may be placed either above or sideways the conveyor belt. The means of the impregnation and degassing of the reinforcing net may consist of vats, spreading rollers, spraying units or other known means which lap and impregnate the net during its progressing from the unwinding reel to the feeding and deposition on the conveyor belt roller. The impregnation and degassing agent consists of the deluted suspensions of hydraulic binder or of aqueous solutions containing surfactant or fluidizing products for the hydraulic binder. Each doser of the hydraulic binders mix includes a containment box for the mix, open on its bottom and provided, at its two ends, with two revolving rolls whose distance, with respect to the conveyor belt, may be suitably adjusted. With respect to the direction of progress of the net, the first roller revolves in the same direction of the net, while the second roller revolves in the opposite direction. In this way the first inlet roller feeds the mix of hydraulic binders, while the second outlet roller regulates the thickness of the thin mix layer which comes out of the containment box, effecting the dosing of the mix itself. The system for the feeding and deposition of the reinforcing net on the conveyor belt carrying the thin mix layer, consists of two co operating rollers with their surface fitted with points or pins, knurled or grooved. The reinforcing net passes between the first and the second roller and is immersed into the mix layer by the second roller, whose surface is placed near the conveyor belt, at a distance only slightly greater than the thickness of the mix layer. The compacting elements have the task of immersing the reinforcing net into the thin layers of the mix and to eliminate the residual air drafted along by the reinforcing nets. One type of compacting element constists of a metal rocking arm, pivoted at one end and provided at its opposite end with percussion blades. Said percussion blades, which may have either a continuous or a notched edge, are directed towards the conveyor belt at an angle of 10 90 , but preferably with a slanting angle of between 20 and 80 , with respect to the direction of progress of the conveyer belt. Said blades may effect a number of percussions on the composite net mix layers comprised between 100 and 3000 blows minute, but preferably comprised between 200 and 1000 blows min. With this compacting element there may be associated other known types of compacting means, such as for instance those with vibrating blades, which may operate with either horizontal, vertical or mixed horizontal vertical vibrations, with reference to the plane of the conveyor belt. Underneath the compacting zones there are located stations for the extraction of the water, in order to collect excess water, leaving, however, at each station, in the mix a certain content in water sufficient to allow the welding together with the mix layer which is deposited successively. Said content in water stands in a relationship with the initial or starting water content in the mix and varies from 15 to 40 with respect to the dry binder. The station for the levelling sizing of the surface of the plate and comprising one or more mix reinforcing net layers consists of a metal plate provided with a vibrator that imparts to the station, rectilinear oscillating movements, both in a transversal as well as in a parallel direction with respect to that of the advancing or progressing movement of the conveyor belt. The plate is suspended at an adjustable height determined with respect to the conveyor belt in such a way as to rest only slightly on the composite plate. The stations for the extraction of the excess water, generally consist of vacuum generating aspirators which may be arranged on one or both faces of the plate. The plate pressing station consists of a second conveyor belt of porous material, arranged on the upper part of the first conveyor belt. This second conveyor belt is slanted, with respect to the first conveyor belt, in such a way as to define between them a space that progressively gets narrower from the inlet towards the outlet of the composite plate. Said second conveyor belt may be fitted with a washing and drying element that is placed on the opposite side to that facing the first conveyor belt. The pressing station may be provided with under vacuum suction elements serving to eliminate the water that is freed during the pressing phase, and which are arranged above and underneath the composite plate. The first conveyor belt, which feeds the various layers of mix net and the resulting plate at the various stations of the device object of the present invention, is made of porous materials such as, for instance, felt, unwoven textiles and the likes in natural, artificial or synthetic fibres, as well as in metal or mineral fibres or filaments. The pressed plate is then cut, both in the longitudianl as well as in the transversal sense, in the wished size by cutting stations of a conventional type, and the thus sized reinforced plate will then be received by a conveyor belt for either being stored or conveyed to successive finishing treatments, such as, for instance, forming. This device allows to produce plates reinforced by two or more alternating layers of hydraulic binders and nets, while it also allows wide variations in the quality and compositions of the binders fed to the various stations, as well as in the types of feedable reinforcements, in the same operation, from various stations. The process according to the present invention comprises the steps recited in claim 10. As hydraulic binders there may be used cement, plaster, hydraulic lime and the likes, either alone or in admixture with each other. Said binders may be additioned with fillers consisting of inorganic compounds, such as, for instance, silicon, calcium carbonate, sand, quartz sand, pumice, of surfactants, fluidizers, hardness accelerating or retarding agents of water repellent agents, of dyeing pigments, hydrosoluble dyes, synthetic resin, natural, artificial and synthetic fibres as well as of mineral fibres, of asbestos, of metal fibres or filaments, preferably of short lengths, etc. The volumetric ratio , water binder, should be comprised between 25ß75 100, but preferably 30ß50 100. The reinforcing net like structures consist of superimposed fibrilles synthetic films, in particular of films of polyolefines, such as predominantly isotactic macromolecules crystalline polypropylene of high and low density polyethylene, crystalline ethylene propylene copolymers with a prevailing content of propylene, both of the random tpye as well as of the block type, or mixtures thereof. The olefinic polymers are preferably added with various different compounds, which have the function of facilitating the adhesion of the nets to the hydraulic binder. Said compounds may be calcium or magnesium carbonate, silicon, ground marble, cement, pozzuolana, powder glass, ground mineral ashes, zycronium salts oxides of alkaline and alkaline earthy metals and the likes. The reinforced plates, prepared with the device and according to the process object of the present invention, find their application in the manufacture of flat or corrugated plates, of plumbing, of tanks, of paving tiles, of sound absorbing and insulating panels, and generally in applications in the building industry. The functional and constructional characteristics of the device for the continuous manufacture of articles based on mixes of hydraulic binders, object of the present invention, may be better understood by means of the following detailed description wherein refernce is also made to the figures of the drawings hereto attached and which represent only just a preferred execution embodiment , given for exemplifying purposes and in no way limitative, of said device, and wherein With reference to the attached figures, the device for the manufacture in a continuous way of manufactured articles based on hydraulic binder mixes, consists of a conveyor belt 1 , made of a porous material and driven by a motor not shown in the drawings . On the upper part of the conveyor belt 1 there are arranged at least two stations, A and A , for the formation of thin, uniform and superimposed layers of a hydraulic binder mix and a net. Each station A consists of a roller 3 for the feeding of the net 4 a device 5 for wetting, impregnating and degassing the net 4 with surfactant or fluidizing agents for the hydraulic binder, or with aqueous dispersions of hydraulic binders, etc a metering device 2 for dosing the hydraulic binder mix a unit 7 to feed the net 4 over the mix layer and compacting elements 16 a device 6 for the initial extraction of the excess water in the compacting stage and a second metering device 2 of the hydraulic binder mix. The impregnating device 5 consists of a container tank holding the impregnating suspension, and of a spreading or coating roller which fishes in the dispersion and laps the net 4 during its passage. Feeding means 7 for the net 4 consist of two co operating driving rollers 8 and 8 provided on their surface with pins or with grooves see figure 5 , which feed and deposit the net 4 onto the conveyor belt 1 which carries the thin layer of mix deposited by the dosing unit 2 . The roller 8 of the feeding means 7 is located near the conveyor belt 1 so that its generating line be distanced from said conveyor belt by just a slightly greater distance than the thickness of the thin mix layer. With reference to figure 2 , each dosing device 2 and 2 consists of a containment box 9 for the mix being fed from one feeding line B. Said containment box is provided, at its two ends, with two rollers 12 and 13 each provided with corresponding scraper blades 10 . The side walls of the containment box 9 rest on the porous conveyor belt by means of gaskets 14 mounted on elastic supports so as to allow the adjustment in height of the containment box 9 itself and thus to avoid the lateral flowing out of the mix. Rollers 12 and 13 are driven by motors not indicated in the drawings and revolve in opposite directions to each other, with linear velocities that may be different from each other. The first roller 12 , arranged at the inlet end of the conveyor belt 1 , revolves in the same direction as that of progressing of the conveyor belt 1 itself, while the second roller 13 , arranged at the outlet end of the conveyor belt 1 , revolves in the opposite direction of conveyor 1 . The first roller 12 and the second roller 13 may be adjusted in height with respect to the conveyor belt 1 through an adjusting system 11 and 15 respectively. The height of the first roller 12 is adjusted so as to ensure the passage of the thin mix net layer or layers coming from the preceeding station In order to ensure a complete and perfect immersion and impregnation of the net 4 in the thin layer of hydraulic binder mix, as well as for eliminating the possible residual air dragged along by the reinforcing net 4 , there have been foreseen compacting elements 16 , of which two, i.e. 16 and 16 , have been schematically represented in figures 3 and 4. Element 16 , schematically shown in figure 3, consists of a suspended flat steel blade 17 which is lightly pushed against the net mix layer resting on the conveyor belt 1 , by means of a suitable mechanism 18 , and of a vibrator 19 which makes the blade vibrate both vertically as well as horizontally. The number of vibrations is comprised between 1000 and 30.000 vibrations per minute, but which are preferably comprised between 3000 and 15.000 vibr. min. A second type of compacting element 16 , which may be used quite conveniently in the device object of the present invention is illustrated schematically in Fig. 4. This compacting element 16 consists of a suspended metal arm 20 hinged at one end on a fixed pivot 21 , and is provided at the other free end with percussion blades 22 . Said percussion blades are preferably inclined at angles comprised between 10 and 90 , preferably comprised between 20 and 80 , with respect ot the direction of progress of the conveyor belt 1 . This compacting element 16 may effect a number of percussions comprised between 100 and 3.000 blow per minute bpm , but preferably comprised between 500 and 1000 strokes min. Co operating with these compacting elements 16 and 16 , there may be associated also other types of compacting devices, such as for instance those with a vibratory motion, applied under the conveyor belt 1 so as to obtain the maximum possible compacting of the manufactured article. The reinforced and compacted multi layer plate thus obtained is level led, as far as its surface is concerned, in a levelling and sizing station 23 , illustrated in figure 6. Said station 23 consists of a metal plate 24 and a vibrator 25 fixed to that same plate. Vibrator 25 , which may be of the electric type, imparts to plate 24 alternating horizontal movements in a perpendicular sense with respect to hte direction of advancement of the conveyor belt 1 , but lying on the same plane of advancement of conveyor belt 1 . The distance between plate 24 and the surface of the plate is accurately adjusted so as to obtain the desired thickness. Subsequently the multi layers plate, compacted and level led, thus obtained is made to pass from the conveyor belt 1 through a final vacuum suction station in order to remove the excess water. Said vacuum suction station 27 consists of a suction or aspirating units 26 arranged in correspondence with one or both faces of the plate, but preferably arranged underneath the plate. The plate is, then subjected to pressing in a pressing station 27 , illustrated in detail in figure 7. Said pressing station 27 consists of an advancing pressing belt 28 of porous material , superimposed on conveyor belt 1 , which carries the reinforce plate, and stretched over rollers 29 , 30 and 31 , of which at least one is a driving roller. The distance between the two mutually facing surfaces of the tow belts 1 and 28 decreases in the direction of the advancement of the plate, so that the latter is pressed between the said two belts with a gradually increasing pressure. On the upper part of the pressing belt 28 there may be provided a washing element 33 and a suction unit 34 in order to clean and dry said belt before it meets the moist plate. The pressing station 27 may be provided with suction elements 32 for the extraction of the water that is freed during the pressing stage of the plates. The pressed plates coming out between the belts 1 and 28 , are cut up to required size at cutting stations 35 and 36 , of the known type, and are then carried away by a further conveyor belt 37 and picked up by suction cups feeding suckers 38 for the stocking or for the starting of the known forming operations.
