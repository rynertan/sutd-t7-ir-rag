## Description
PROCESS FOR THE CATALYTIC REDUCTION OF NITRO AROMATIC COMPOUNDS The present invention refers to a process for the catalytic reduction of nitro aromatic compounds. More particularly, the present invention concerns a catalytic process for the hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds through the transfer of hydrogen from alcohols in the presence of iridium complexes. The compounds thus obtained consist, besides the aldehyde or the ketone issuing from the primary or secondary de hydrogenated alcohol, of the derivatives of the partial or total hydrogenation of the starting nitro aromatic compounds. Said derivatives may, depending on the progressive degree of the conducted hydrogenation and or on operating conditions, be aryl hydroxylamines, aryl hydrazo compounds or aryl azo compounds. The products obtained can be used in a wide range of industrial applications. In fact, they represent intermediates for organic syntheses in general, with particular possibilities in the field of fine chemistry.Among these possibilities, aniline has applications in the field of synthetic rubbers as a vulcanization accelerator and anti oxidizing agent , in the production of isocyanates polyurethanes , and especially, together with other aryl amines prepared according to the present invention, in the field of the industry of dyestuffs and of the intermediates for photographic and pharmaceutical products, in the field of explosives, plastics, propellants, insecticides, etc. In their turn, the hydrazo compounds and the aromatic azocompounds are used in the field of dyestuffs, etc. There are known methods for the catalytic reduction of aromatic nitro derivatives that use as a hydrogenation source both molecular hydrogen and hydrogen donors, in general alcohols, carbon oxide and water, etc. In particular there has been described a hydrogenation method or a method of catalytic reduction of nitro aromatic compounds phenylic compounds by means of the transfer of hydrogen from isopropanol, in the presence of phosphinic rhodium and ruthenium complexes and of potassium hydroxide at temperatures greater than 1200C. There are also obtained minor quantities of arylic hydrazo derivatives phenyl derivatives , of azo derivatives and of azoxy benzene. There is an insufficient industrial applicational interest because of the low reaction velocity rate of the methods used that leads to low unitary yields. The catalysts used for this purpose, in fact, produce unsatisfactory reaction rates, lower, even in the order of a hundredfold, than those obtainable by the use of the catalysts according to the present invention, which latter offer much more pronounced characteristics of industrial applicability. Other methods foresee the use of pressurized molecular hydrogen in the presence of iron complexes, ruthenium and rhodium complexes with ptiosphines and or carbon oxide, and of stoichiometric tertiary amines or else the use of CO H20 mixtures under pressure, in the presence of rhodium, iridium, ruthenium, osmium carbonyl clusters at 100 180 C, in order to obtain aromatic amines. Furthermore, there have been described aromatic azo derivatives obtained by the reduction of nitro aryls with CO under pressure 200 atm at about 2000C, in the presence of ferro carbonyls. The above mentioned techniques are not, however, directly pertinent to the present invention because molecular hydrogen is used as a reducing agent or, alternatively, CO, possibly in admixture with H20, under very severe operationing conditions of temperature and pressure.To resume, it only involves methods of a substantially experimental character. The known methods for industrial processing thus remain the conventional hydrogenation methods with molecular hydrogen and heterogeneous catalysis, carried out using Adams , nickel de Raney, copper chromite, palladium on carbon catalysts, etc., or with stoichiometric methods withFe, Zn, Sn and acids HCl etc., which do not technologically show elements that are pertinent to the present invention. According to the present invention, the preparation of hydrogenated compounds aromatic amines, aryl hydroxylamines, aryl azo and arylhydrazo conipounds , by catalytic transfer of hydrogen from alcohols or glycol donors to the starting nitro aromatic compounds, with contemporaneous formation of ketones or aldehydes, with the use of particular iridium complexes, proves particularly effective for its selectivity, versatility and, in particular, for the high reaction velocity ensured by the catalysis. The complex catalysts of iridium used according to the present invention, are compounds known per se and described in the technical literature. A number of iridium complexes with CO are known in the hydrogenation reaction of nitro aryls nitro benzene with the use of CO H20 as a hydrogen source, i.e., in reactions using in pratic only molecular hydrogen as a hydrogenating agent, as indicated above. In this case it is also a question of a technology other than that adopted in the present invention. The present invention may, thus, in a certain way represent an unexpected overcoming of the drawbacks of the Prior Art which mentions the use of catalysts based on iridium complexes with CO as described above in reactions of a proper hydrogenation with gaseous H2 or with equivalents CO H20 . Thus, one object of the present invention is to provide a method for the catalytic reduction of nitro aromatic compounds, with iridium complexes, which is simple, cheap and particularly selective, especially as to the high catalysis speed, using as hydrogen donors alcohols or glycols. This and further objects, which will become evident to the man skilled in the art from the following description, are achieved, according to the present invention, by a process for the catalytic reduction of nitro aromatic compounds by a transfer reaction of hydrogen from alcohols to nitro aromatic compounds, catalized by iridium complexes, and characterized in that a primary or secondary alcohol having the formula I or a glycol EMI3.1 is ade to react with a nitro aromatic compound having the formula II Ar NO x II wherein R and R , also possibly linked to each other to form homo and heterocycles, indifferently represent either a hydrogen atom or a possibly substituted hydrocarbyl group having up to 30 carbon atoms Ar represents either an aryl or a hetero aryl group, also substituted x and y, equal or different from each other, are equal to 1 or 2, in the presence of a complex iridium catalyst chosen from among those having the formulae III and IV Ir Chel L L X and Ir Chel L 2Y III IV wherein Chel represents a bivalent nitrogenous compound with a kelating action L L represents a molecule of a diolefine, preferably not conjugated L represents a molecule of a mono olefine X represents an anion chosen from among Cl , Br , I , Pie , BF4, C104 s B C6H5 4 , OH EMI4.1 wherein R and R have the significance already given above Y represents a halogen, preferably Cl, Br or I at a temperature comprised between about 20 C and the boiling temperature of the reaction mass occurs, preferably in an inert atmosphere and in the optional presence of mineral alkalis. As indicated above, the symbols R and R represent a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbyl group with up to 30 carbon atoms, also substituted with groups inert under reaction conditions. Groups of this type are for instance the esteric, amidic, alcoxylic, cyano, aminic groups. Analogously, the symbol Ar represents in particular an arylic or hetero arylic group, possibly condensed, having at least 5 atoms in the carbon ring arylic groups or also hetero atoms, chosen between N,S and 0 hetero arylic groups , as for instance the phenyl, naphtalene, anthracene, thienyl, furane, pyridine, quinoline groups, etc. Furthermore, there may be present in the Ar group herein above defined, also substituents inert under reaction conditions, chosen, from among those indicated above for the R and R groups, and also, for instance, from among the alkyl, alkenyl, alkinyl groups, having preferably up to 4 carboy atoms. Thus, as nitro aromatic starting compounds of formula it , as defined above, may be used derivatives belonging to the benzenic, naphtalenic, anthracenic, thienylic, furanic, pirydinic, quinolinic, etc. classes. From the definition given for the nitro aromatic compound II , it appears evident that in case of y 1, the compound itself may in particular be a derivative of the nitrous acid which for convenience, in the context of the description is comprised in what is defined as nitro compounds. The reaction is usually carried out in the absence of real and proper solvents either the alcohol of formula I or the glycol used in excess acts as a solvent. At any event, the reaction is compatible with the use of conventional inert solvents such as toluene, benzene, methanol, H20 or terbutanol and in admixture with each other. The use of a solvent, as will be more clearly indicated hereinbelow, niay be particularly useful in the case where it is desired to obtain aryl hydroxylamines or aryl hydrozo compounds, by means of a partial hydrogenation of the starting nitro compound II , at stoichiometric doses of the alcohol donor. According to one particular aspect of this invention, the hydrogen transfer reaction may, in fact, be adjusted in such a way as to obtain, starting from the aromatic nitro compound II or substrate, besides the corresponding amino derivative, by complete hydrogenation of group or groups NO or NO2 present, also the derivatives corresponding to the partial hydrogenation of the substrate itself, i.e., the corresponding aryl hydroxylamines, aryl hydrazo and aryl azo derivatives, which may be substantially condisered intermediate compounds of the total hydrogenation reaction. The involved hydrogen transfer reactions may be, in fact, shematically represented by the following equations EMI5.1 EMI6.1 That is, according to a general scheme for the reactions 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 EMI6.2 In equation 10 , R represents H, OH, or for x 1, NHAr, while all the other symbols have the significance already indicated herein above, and n a whole number or integer from 1 to 4 p is a whole number chosen from among 1, 2, 3, 5 q is a whole number chosen from 1 and 2.Moreover, they have been formulated taking into consideration as a substrate an aromatic nitro derivative y t 2 and x 1, in formula it , in equations 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 and 6 , and a nitrous aromatic substrate y 1 and x 1, in formula Il ,in equation 3 . The whole of these above equations, considered together with equations 3 , 8 , and 9 , quite clearly evidence that, depending on the substrate alcohol donor molar ratios, it is possible to arrive at the corresponding partial hydrogenation derivatives equations 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 , or at the total hydrogenation derivatives equations 1 , 3 , but also that the present invention may equally be applied for the hydrogenation of compounds such as the azoxy aryls VII and the azo aryls VIII , partial hydrogenation intermediates of the nitro aromatic Il compounds, according to equations 8 and 9 , respectively. To resume, through a suitable choice of the parameters involved, i.e. the molar ratios, the solvent, the quantities of alcohols, the catalyst, etc., it is possible, as will be more clearly indicated hereinunder, to direct the hydrogen transfer reaction in such a way as to obtain the desired hydrogenated derivative. The catalysts are optionally used in the presence, as indicated above, of small quantities of mineral alkali, preferably chosen from among NaOH, KOH, LiOH, Ca OH 2, and NaHCO3, in a molar ratio preferably comprised between, 0.1 an 200 with respect to one mole of catalyst. The choice of the optimal ratio of the mineral alkali with respect to the iridium III and IV catalyst used, is of considerable importance as concerns the electively directing of the hydrogen transfer towards the obtention of the desired aminic or hydrazo product, etc. Such a choice, moreover, can be made depending on the nature of the starting substrate, the temperature, the molar ratios etc., adopted. Thus, in particular, in order to selectively obtain the reduction of aromatic nitro derivatives II to the corresponding amines reactions 1 and 3 , low operational values of the alkaline compound catalyst molar ratio must be maintained, preferably comprised between 0.5 1 and about 1.5 1, and a substrate catalyst molar ratio, preferably comprised between 5 1 and about 250 1. Analogously, if it is wished to obtain hydrazo derivatives VI by selective reduction of the corresponding nitro derivatives it , of the azoxy VII and of the azo derivatives VIII equations 4 , 8 , 9 , it is advisable to operate with high values of above mentioned molar ratios, and preferably with a alkaline compouna catalyst molar ratio coinprised between 10 1 and about 100 1, and with a substrate catalyst molar ratio comprised between about 500 1 and 2000 1. From the hydrazo derivatives, moreover, the azo derivatives are obtainable by simple exposure to air. Lastly, in order to selectively obtain the reduction of nitroderivatives II to the corresponding aryl hydroxylamines V equations 2 and 6 , it is convenient to operate with low substrate catalyst molar ratios, preferably at values comprised between about 50 1 and about 250 1, stopping the reaction as soon as the nitro aromatic compound has been reduced, while the alkaline compound catalyst ratio is comprised between 1 1 and about 10 1. Obviously, in these reactions the choice of the catalyst also has its influence, as will be more clearly explained herein below. In this connection, in order to achieve a more correct dosage of the alcohol donor, it is adviseable to operate in a solvent medium different from the alcohol itself. As far as the catalysts are concerned, the iridium complexes used according to the invention have the formulae III and IV , wherein, in particular, the kelating azotized bi toothed compound Chel is preferably chosen from among 2,2 dipyridyl dipy , 3,3 dimethyl 2,2 dipyridyl, 4,4 dimethyl 2,2 dipyridyl, 1 10 phenanthroline, 5,6 dimethyl 1,10 phenanthroline, 4,7 dimethyl 1,10 phenanthroline, 3,4,7,8 tetramethyl 1,10phenanthroline, 4,7 diphenyl 1,10 phenanthroline and sulphonated phenanthroline. ihe preferably non conjugated diolefine L L is chosen from among 1,5 hexadiene, norbornadiene and 1,5 cyclo octadiene cis cis the monoolefine L is the cyclooctene or ethylene, anion X has already been defined. The following proved to be especially effective catalysts according to the present invention. Ir 3,4,7,8 CH3 4 phen CH2 CH2 2Cl Ir phen CH2 CH2 2Cl . Ir 4,7 CH3 2 phen CH2 CH2 2Cl . Ir 4,4 CH 2 dipy CH2 CH2 2Cl Ir 44 C6H5 2 dipy CH2 CH2 2Cl Ir dipy CH2 CH2 2Cl .Ir 3,4,7,8 CH3 4 phen COD Cl Ir 3,4,7,8 CH 4 phen 1,5 hexadiene ClO4 . Ir 4,7 CH3 2 phen 1,5 hexadiene ClO4 . Ir phen 1,5 hexadiene ClO4 . Ir 4,7 C6H5 2 phen 1,5 hexadiene ClO4 . Ir 4,4 CH3 2 dipy 1,5 hexadiene ClO4 , Ir 4,4 C6Hs 2 dipy 1,5 hexadiene C104 . Ir dipy 1,5 hexadiene ClO4 wherein phen stands for phenanthroline, dipy stands for 2,2 dipyridyl, COD stands for 1,5 cyclooctadiene. More particularly, with reference to the obtainable products, particularly effective for the reduction of the aromatic II nitroderivatives to amines and hydrazo derivatives VI have proved to be Ir 3,4,7,8 CH3 4phen CH CH2 2Cl and Ir 3,4,7,8 CH3 4phen 1,5 hexadiene ClO4 while for obtaining amines and aryl hydroxylamines V the following proved to be particularly effective Ir 4,4 C6H5 2dipy CH2 CH2 2Cl, Ir 4,4 C6H5 2dipy 1,5 hediene ClO4 Ir 4,7 C6H5 2phen CH2 CH2 2Cl Ir 4,7 C H5 2phen 1,5 hexadiene C104 in which phen stands for phenanthroline, dipy stanas for 2,2 dipyridyl. Furthermore, catalysts III and IV provide the maximum catalytic activity provided they are preliminarily subjected to activation through molecular hydrogen and subsequently submitted to reflux heating. In any event, this is a question of a preferred but not indispensable procedure. The iridium complexes used as catalysts according to the present invention are in turn prepared according to the techniques known per se. For instance, the iridium complex having the formula Ir Chel L L Cl of type III , wherein the kelating substance is, for instance, 3,4,7,8 tetramethyl 1,10 phenanthroline and L L is 1,5 cyclooctadiene COD , may be prepared starting from a degassed solution of IrCODCl 2 inmethylene chloride by the addition of the kelating agent in a slight excess and by successive precipitation with ethyl ether. The complex catalysts of the iridium of formula IV are likewise prepared according to substantially conventional techniques. For instance, the iridium complex of formula Ir Chel L 2Cl of type IV , wherein L is cyclooctene, is prepared starting from a degassed Ir cyclooctene Cl solution in benzene, solution which is then filtered in an inert gas atmosphere and the liquid filtrate is then additioned with an excess of monoolefine cyclooctene and then with the azotized kelating agent, precipitating the complexes as solid crystals which are then filtered. Furthermore, the catalyst may, according to the present invention, also be directly prepared in situ in the reaction medium by the addition of the chosen kelating agent to the halogenated olefine complex of iridium. The catalyst according to this invention, is used in quantities that may vary within a wide range.Advantageous results are achieved with the use, for each mole of nitro aromatic II compound, of quantities comprised between 1x10 2 and 1x10 4 moles of catalyst. The complex catalysts of the iridium of the invention are used in an optionally basic medium, as specified above, by the presence of mineral alkaline compounds. Suitable reaction means are preferably the alcoholic solutions constituted by the alcohol donor I or by the excess glycol which acts as a reaction medium. The reaction is conducted according to a molar ratio of the reactants varying within a wide range practically optimal results are obtainable with values of the alcohol donor nitro aromatic acceptor compound molar ratio comprised between 1 1 and 200 1, the alcohol in excess being used as a solvent reaction medium. The reduction reaction, according to the present invention, is conducted under atmospheric pressure and preferably in an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, argon, etc. Temperatures from 200C to about 200 C are possible up to the boiling point of the solution. Nitro aromatic reducible compounds according to the present invention are, in particular, among the aromatic substances, nitro benzene, nitro toluene, nitro anisol, nitroaniline, nitro benzamide, nitrobenzonitrile, nitro naphtalene, nitro styrene, dinitro benzene, dinitrotoluene, dinitro aniline, dinitro benzamide, dinitro benzonitrile among the hetero aromatics, the nitro pyridines, nitro quinolines, etc. along with the corresponding nitrous derivatives such as nitrous benzene, etc., the corresponding aryl azoxy and aryl azo compounds, Thus, compounds II are also reducible which have more than one nitric function, which in such a case are preferably reduced using a ratio alkaline compound to a catalyst equal to about 1 and a substrate catalyst ratio lower than about 10. The isopropylic, ethylic, 2 butylic, cyclohexylic, benzylic, cyclopentylic, etc. alcohols proved to be effective alcohol donors. The product is then separated according to conventional techniques.Practically it concerns separating the solvent or alcohol possibly in excess by distillation, while the high boiling fraction consists of the hydrogenated compound, generally in a quantitative way, etc. More particularly, the amines may thus be isolated after a preliminary filtering the solution under heat, possibly in an inert atmosphere, on animal carbon coal for the quantitative separation of the catalyst, by removal of the solvent under vacuum, etc. The hydrazo derivatives, for instance hydrazo benzene, may be obtained by additioning the end solution under heat, and possibly freed from the catalyst as indicated above, under an inert atmosphere, with deaerated water and by removing the solvent. The aryl hydroxylamines are obtained by stopping the reaction with an excess of water. During cooling the crystals separate and are then filtered, etc. The catalyst may in its turn be recovered and recycled, for instance, treating with a solvent dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide the animal carbon into which it is adsorbed by filtration of the reaction mass. By the addition of ether to the solution thus obtained, the catalyst will precipitate and be recycled after having been activated, etc. Or, alternatively, the final reaction solution, concentrated to a small volume, is diluted with ether until the catalyst begins to precipitate.Thereupon the suspension thus obtained is treated with neutral alumina, by which latter the catalyst remains adsorbed. The catalyst containing alumina is then filtered, washed with ether and treated with the alcohol donor isopropanol and heated while the catalyst is thereafter recycled. According to an effective form of embodiment, in actual practice, one proceeds as follows. Into a reactor fitted with reactant feeding systems and a heat stabilizing device, is introduced, under an inert atmosphere nitrogen , the possible solvent and the alcohol donor and then the desired quantities of catalyst and the possible base, in a determined ratio. Thereafter one proceeds to the activation of the catalyst and, finally, the nitroaromatic II compound is added, possibly dissolved in alcohol in a pre fixed ratio, under a nitrogen flow, heating the whole mass at the determined temperature and for the established time. At the end of the reaction, controlled for instance by gaschromatography, the separation of the product according to the PriorArt techniques is carried out. Due to the simple and mild operational conditions, the process is particularly convenient. A further advantage consists in the fact that it is possible to conduct the selective reduction of the nitro aromatic II compounds also in the presence of olefinic links, an aspect that is of particular industrial interest. Moreover, the process according to this invention, due to the greater activity of the catalysts with respect to the hydrogen transferring catalysts of the prior art, allows the obtention of high conversion rates, greater than 98 , in shorter times and with high substrate to catalyst ratios. In particular, they prove to be much more active and selective than the above mentioned prior art catalysts, when using isopropanol as a hydrogen donor, and in general developing an activity comparable with that of the best reduction catalysts of the prior art. Moreover, these catalysts display a greater versatility with respect to the partial or total hydrogenation products and furthermore they are recoverable. The invention will now be described in further detail by the following examples, given by way of non limitative illustration.
