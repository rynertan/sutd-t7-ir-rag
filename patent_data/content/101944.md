Experimental Example 1 Effect on cell mediated immunity in normal mice i Method The action of benzyl malic acid on cell mediated immunity was investigated using as its index the degree of delayed type hypersensitivity hereinafter referred to asD.T.H. obtained by inoculating the foot pads of mice with sheep red blood cells hereinafter referred to as SRBC used as the antigen Reference J.Exp.Med. 139, 1529 1539, 1974 . A suspension of 10 SRBCs in 0.05 ml of physiological saline solution was inoculated subcutaneously to the foot pad of one of the hind legs of CDF1 mice female, 8 weeks old . Simultaneously, an aqueous solution containing 5, 0.5, 0.05 or 0.005 mg kg of of alpha benzyl malic acid was ad ministered intraperitoneally in a single dose. Four days after administration, a suspension of 108 SRBCs in 0.05 ml of physiological saline solution was subcutaneously administered to the foot pad of the other hind leg to induce secondary immune response. Twenty four hours later, swelling on the foot pad increased thickness of the foot pad was measured with a calipers.The thickness of the foot pad in control animals, which had been sensitized withSRBCs and intraperitoneally administered physiological saline solution without having received the test compound, was evaluated to be 100 . The thickness of the foot pad in the test animals that had been treated in the aforementioned way was compared with that in the control animals, thereby judging the cell mediated immunity potentiating effect of the test compound. ii Results Test caExunds Dose Thickness of on the control s mg kg the foot pad value x 0.1 mm drbenzyl malic 5 12.8 1.42 149 acid 0.5 14.4 1.52 167 0.05 13.4 1.61 156 0.005 11.8 1.15 137 Bestatin 0.5 12.6 1.12 147Control 8.6 1.29 100 Bestatin 2S,3R 5 amino 2 hydroxy 4 phenyl S leucine 3 a compound having inrmmatodulating activity which was made public by Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 7187 76. As noted above, the present compound was found to have a cell mediated immunity augmenting activity comparable or superior to that 147 t for the group receiving 0.5 mg kg of the reference drug bestatin. Experimental Example 2 Effect on cell mediated immunity in cancer inflicted mice picryl chloride was used as the antigen i Method 106 cells of Ascites Sarcoma 180 were intraperitoneally transplanted to groups of 12 week old female CDF1 mice 6 mice group . The day of transplantation was designated as Day 0. On Day 1, a 6 solution of picryl chloride in ethanol was applied to a shaven skin 25 mm x 15 mm of the abdomen with the use of a cut absorbent cotton 20 mm x 20 mm x 2 mm impregnated with the solution to thereby sensitize the mice. On Day 8, both ears were measured for thickness with a dial gauge, to determine the baseline value a . Then, both ears were sensitized with a 20 mm x 4 mm x 1 mm cut absorbent cotton impregnated with a 1 solution of picryl chloride in olive oil. On Day 9, both swollen ears were measured for their thickness with a dial gauge to obtain a value b . The baseline value a was subtracted from the value b to determine the increase in ear thickness b a for the control group C . On the other hand, 5.0, 0.5, 0.05 or 0.005 mg kg of the test compound dissolved in physiological saline solution was orally administered once daily for 6 consecutive days between the day and 8 days after inoculation of Sarcoma 180. The mice were sensitized with picryl chloride in the same way as in the control group, and the thickness of the ears was similarly measured to determine the increase in ear thickness b a for the treatment group T . The rate of increase in ear thickness for the treatment group to that for the control group was calculated from the following equation T x 100 C to determine the cell mediated immunity modulating activity of the present compound. ii Results EMI5.1 tb Test SEP compounds SEP Dose SEP Increase SEP in SEP Rate SEP to SEP the SEP control tb SEP mg kg SEP ear SEP thickness SEP value tb SEP x SEP 0.01 SEP mm SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP tb benzyl SEP malic SEP 5.0 SEP 4.71 SEP SEP 0.95 SEP 114.6 tb acid SEP 0.5 SEP 5.08 SEP SEP 0.56 SEP 123.6 tb SEP 0.05 SEP 5.29 SEP SEP 0.33 SEP 128.7 tb SEP 0.005 SEP 5.18 SEP SEP 0.67 SEP 126.0 tb Control physio SEP 4.11 SEP SEP 1.11 SEP 100.0 tb logical SEP saline tb P 0.05Thus, the group treated with 0.05 mg kg of the present compound showed significant cell mediated immunity modulating activity corresponding to an increase in ear thickness of 5.29 0.33 10 ê mm and a rate of increase in ear thickness of 128.7 . The foregoing results demonstrate that alpha benzyl malic acid potentiates cell mediated immunity in normal animals and modulates cell mediated immunity depressed by cancer infliction. Acute toxicity tests in mice have proved the present compound to cause no deaths at an i.v. dose of 500 mg kg.The present compound is therefore believed to be a safe substance. As noted above, benzyl malic acid of this invention has been found to enhance immune response by itself and to exhibit an anticancer effect mediated by the host.Accordingly, the compounds of this invention are useful as immunopotentiators and antitumor immunomodulators, or as adjuvants to various chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. Such drugs containing benzyl malic acid as their active ingredients can be prepared by blending either drbenzyl malic acid or its pharmacologically acceptable salts with widely used carriers, and if desired, further mixing the resulting blends with various chemotherapeutic agents. Examples of the debenzyl malic acid salts are salts formed between the carboxyl groups of d6benzyl malic acid and pharmacologically acceptable cations, e.g., the cations of alkali metals, such as sodium and potassium, the cations of alkaline earth metals such as calcium and magnesium, and ammonium ions i.e. carboxylates . The present compound or drugs of this invention may be administered as oral preparations, injections or rectal suppositories. Compositions comprising the aforementioned active ingredient can be converted into lyophilized injections by adding to them pH adjustors, buffers, stabilizers or excipients, and freeze drying the mixtures by customary methods. Hypodermic, intramuscular, and intravenous injections can be prepared from compounds of the active ingredient by customary methods after the addition of pH adjustors, buffers, stabilizers, isotonizers, and local anesthetics.For the preparation of oral solids, excipients, and if desired, binders, disintegrators, lubricants, colorants, correctives of taste and correctives of odor may be added to compounds of the active ingredient, and the mixtures can be formed into tablets, coated tablets, granules, powders, capsules, etc. by customary methods. For the preparation of oral liquids, correctives of taste, buffers, stabilizers, correctives of odor, etc.may be added to compounds of the active ingredient, and the mixtures can be formed into syrups and dry syrups by customary methods. To prepare rectal suppositories, excipients, and if desired, surfactants may be added to compounds of the active ingredient, and the mixtures can be made into suppositories by customary methods. The dose of Crbenzyl malic acid may be varied depending on symptoms. For adults, it is recommended to administer 0.02 to 200 mg of vbenzyl malic acid once daily. For concomitant therapy with other carcinostatic chemotherapeutic agents or immunostimulants, benzyl malic acid in doses within said dosage range can be combined with the usual doses of such carcinostatic chemotherapeutic agents or immunostimulants. Examples of preparations, according to the present invention, are shown hereinbelow Example 1 1 g of sodium benzyl malate and 5 g of mannitol are dissolved in distilled water to make 1,000 ml of a solution. The solution is sterilized by a customary method, and dispensed into vials in amounts of 2 ml each, followed by freeze drying the contents. When the lyophilized product is to be used, it is reconstituted with distilled water to make an injection. Example 2 1 part of sodium 1 benzyl malate, 200 parts of lactose, 50 parts of corn starch, and 7 parts of polyvinyl pyrrolidone are mixed. The mixture is granulated with ethanol, dried, and screened by customary methods.The resulting granules are blended with 0.5 magnesium stearate, and the blend is formed by a tablet press into tablets with an active ingredient content of 3.6 mg each. Example 3 0.5 g of sodium debenzyl malate, 300 g of sugar, 1 g of citric acid, 250 mg of thioglycerol and 2 ml of orange extract are dissolved in distilled water to make 1,000 ml of a solution which serves as a syrup. Example 4 1 part of sodium rbenzyl malate and 300 parts of cacao butter are fused and blended. The blend is formed by a customary method into suppositories weighing 2 g each.
