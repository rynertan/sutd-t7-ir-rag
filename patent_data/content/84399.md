# Self aligned oxide isolated process and device.

## Abstract
Improved self aligned semiconductor devices are made using two sets of superposed pattern forming layers a master mask layer set 105 containing the self aligned patterns, and a pattern selector layer set 107 which allows different apertures in the master mask layer to be selectively re opened so that different device regions may be sequen tially formed. The master mask layer 105 is a double layer of a first material 105a resistant to typical device forming processes, covered by a second etch stop material 105b . The selector layer 107 may be a single process resistant material or a double layer 107a b . Using combinations of silicon oxide and nitride, the process is applied to the formation of silicon islands 30 with emitters 24 and emitter 27 , base 28 , and collector contacts 29 self aligned to each other and a surrounding oxide isolation region 26 .
