## Description
Hybrid DNA technology permits the transcription and translation of genes to produce desired polypeptide products. For the most part, the polypeptide products that are of interest are associated with mammalian genes, while the choice of host cells has been primarily directed to prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes, e.g. fungi, especially yeast due to ease of propagation and genetic manipulation. In developing a methodology for producing DNA constructs which provide efficient production of a desired polypeptide, one must develop a protocol which allows for the insertion and excision of DNA fragments in an ordered way. Frequently, the various regulatory signals, replication system, markers and the structural gene s of interest will come from diverse sources. Therefore, one must develop a strategy which allows for endonuclease cleavages, insertions and excisions in an appropriate sequence, which provides for the DNA fragments being aligned in the correct orientation and the proper spatial relationship. Furthermore, the presence of sequences which do or could interfere with the efficient transcription, translation or propagation of the desired structural gene, must be avoided or may be present only where they do not have a detrimental effect. In addition to the strategy involved with the preparation of the DNA construct, there is also the considerations of the choice of sequences which encode for the regulatory signals and expression products, their individual interactions, their effect on the host, the efficiency with which the energy of the host is diverted to the production of the desired polypeptide, and the ease of isolation of the polypeptide product. Therefore, each development of a process for the production of a particular polypeptide becomes an intellectual exercise in experimental design, procedural organization, and investigation. The human DNA sequence for human insulin may be found in Bell Method and compositions are provided for the production of a pre proinsulin in a yeast host and secretion of processed pre proinsulin into the nutrient medium. The DNA constructs are produced by joining of DNA sequences from diverse sources, providing a construct which is stably replicated in a yeast host and results in efficient high level production of processed pre proinsulin into the nutrient medium, where it may be isolated in high yield. Novel DNA constructs are provided for the efficient production of mammalian pre proinsulin in a yeast host and processing of the pre proinsulin. The constructs provide for transcription and translation of mammalian pre proinsulin and processing and secretion of the polypeptide product into the nutrient medium. The construction therefore involves a DNA construct which includes a replication system capable of stable maintenance in a yeast host an efficient promoter a structural gene including leader and processing signals joined to the coding region for proinsulin in reading frame with the secretion leader and processing coding sequence, and a terminator sequence downstream from the structural gene. Optionally, other sequences can be provided for transcriptional regulation, amplification of the gene, exogenous regulation of transcription, and the like. The pre proinsulin intends a gene encoding for human proinsulin in reading frame with a leader sequence and processing signals efficiently recognized by the yeast host. Thus, pre intends the secretion and processing signals associated with the yeast host as distinguished from the human sequences naturally present with proinsulin for processing the native prepropeptide to proinsulin. In preparing the construct, it is necessary to bring the individual sequences together in a predetermined order to ensure that at each stage, sequences which are present are not disturbed, so as to detrimentally affect their function, and that each of the sequences which are introduced are properly positioned in relation to the other sequences, so as to be able to fulfill their individual functions. Furthermore, adaptor molecules may be employed to advantage for organizing the construct. The proinsulin gene which is employed may be chromosomal DNA, cDNA, synthetic, or combinations thereof. Since the proinsulin gene is a mammalian gene and the regulatory, leader and processing, and transcriptional terminator signals will be sequences derived from and recognized by the host, it will be useful to join the several sequences by means of connecting or adaptor sequences. Thus, by appropriate choice of restriction sites, one can provide the proinsulin gene restricted internally and proximal to the 5 terminus of the coding strand, so as to lack a number of base pairs. Similarly, the leader and processing signal sequences may be restricted internal and proximal to the 3 terminus of the coding strand, so as to lack a plurality of base pairs. Unless otherwise indicated, the 5 and 3 designations intend the coding strand. The restriction sites are chosen so that the adaptor results in the proper reading frame for the proinsulin gene. Since the adaptor can be prepared synthetically, it is desirable that the codons of the adaptor be those preferentially utilized by the yeast host, e.g. as occur in glycolytic enzymes, rather than employing the naturally occurring mammalian codons. The adaptor will have from about 20 to 40, more usually from about 25 to 35 bases in the coding sequence and may have cohesive ends or butt ends, preferably cohesive ends. Desirably, the termini of the adaptor will have different cohesive ends, so as to ensure the proper orientation of the adaptor. Therefore, the two ends to be linked will also have different termini. For the leader and processing signals, one may use a naturally occurring DNA sequence from yeast. Polypeptides which are secreted by yeast include The subject invention will be illustrated with the cDNA gene for proinsulin used with the regulatory, leader and processing signals, and transcriptional terminator of yeast The yeast The human proinsulin cDNA is restricted with At the other end of the fragment containing the cDNA gene for proinsulin is the Conveniently, the promoter which is employed may be the promoter associated with the leader sequence. In this manner, one can provide a 5 portable element which contains both the promoter and the leader sequence in proper spatial relationship for efficient transcription. One may further include a transcriptional terminator to create a cassette consisting of promoter leader heterologous gene terminator. This is achieved by isolating a DNA fragment which includes an intact gene from a yeast host and the upstream and downstream transcriptional regulatory sequences of the gene, where the gene expresses a polypeptide which is secreted by a yeast host. This has been exemplified above with The proinsulin cDNA will have its own stop codons to ensure that the C terminus of the polypeptide is the same as the naturally occurring C terminus. Alternatively, one may replace the naturally occurring promoter by other promoters which allow for transcriptional regulation. This will require sequencing and or restriction mapping of the region upstream from the leader sequence to provide for introduction of a different promoter. In some instances, it may be desirable to retain the naturally occurring promoter and provide a second promoter in tandem, either upstream or downstream from the naturally occurring promoter. A wide variety of promoters are available or can be obtained from yeast genes. Promoters of particular interest include those promoters involved with enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, such as promoters for alcohol dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, triose phosphate isomerase, phosphoglucoisomerase, phosphofructokinase, etc. By employing these promoters with regulatory sequences, such as operators, repressors and derepressors, and using a host having an intact regulatory system, one can regulate the expression of the processed pre proinsulin. Thus, various small organic molecules, e.g. glucose, may be employed for the regulation of production of the desired polypeptide One may also employ temperature sensitive regulatory mutants which allow for modulation of transcription by varying the temperature. Thus, by growing the cells at the non permissive temperature, one can grow the cells to high density, before changing the temperature in order to provide for expression of the processed pre proinsulin. Other capabilities may also be introduced into the construct. For example, some genes provide for amplification, where upon stress to the host, not only is the gene which responds to the stress amplified, but also flanking regions. By placing such a gene upstream from the promoter and the other regulatory signals providing transcriptional control of the pre proinsulin, and stressing the yeast host, plasmids may be obtained which have a plurality of repeating sequences, which sequences include the pre proinsulin gene with its regulatory sequences. Illustrative genes include metallothioneins and dihydrofolate reductase. The construct may include in addition to the leader sequence fragment, other DNA homologous to the host genome. If it is desired that there be integration of the proinsulin gene into the chromosome s , integration can be enhanced by providing for sequences flanking the proinsulin gene construct which are homologous to host chromosomal DNA. The replication system which is employed will be recognized by the yeast host. Therefore, it is desirable that the replication system be native to the yeast host. A number of yeast vectors are reported by Botstein After each manipulation, as appropriate, the construct may be cloned so that the desired construct is obtained pure and in sufficient amount for further manipulation. Desirably, a shuttle vector i.e., containing both a yeast and bacterial origin of replication may be employed so that cloning can be performed in prokaryotes, particularly The plasmids may be introduced into the yeast host by any convenient means, employing yeast host cells or spheroplasts and using calcium precipitated DNA for transformation or other conventional techniques. The modified hosts may be selected in accordance with the genetic markers which are usually provided in a vector used to construct the expression plasmid. An auxotrophic host may be employed, where the plasmid has a gene which complements the host and provides prototrophy. Alternatively, resistance to an appropriate biocide, e.g. antibiotic, heavy metal, toxin, or the like, may be included as a marker in the plasmid. Selection may then be achieved by employing a nutrient medium which stresses the parent cells, so as to select for the cells containing the plasmid. The plasmid containing cells may then be grown in an appropriate nutrient medium, and the desired secreted polypeptide isolated in accordance with conventional techniques. The polypeptide may be purified by chromatography, extraction, etc. Since the polypeptide will be present in mature form in the nutrient medium, one can cycle the nutrient medium, continuously removing the desired polypeptide.
