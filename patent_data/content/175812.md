# A method for determining the mixing ratio of two or more compositions employed to prepare a polymer.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to a method for determining the mixing ratio of two or more compositions employed to form a polymer. The method comprises adding a separate tracer compound to each composition, mixing the composi tions to form a polymer, curing the polymer, extracting the tracer compounds from the cured polymer, analyzing the extracts for the tracer compounds, and calculating the mixing ratio of the compositions.
