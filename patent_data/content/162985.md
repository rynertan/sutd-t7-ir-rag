# INTRAOCULAR LENS AND METHOD OF IMPLANTATION THEREOF

## Abstract
An intraocular lens for use following extracapsular cataract extraction is provided with an optic that has one or more resilient haptics secured at the inner end thereof to the optic and normally extending outwardly from theoptic, terminating in a free outermost end spaced from the peripheral edge of the optic. Prior to lens implantation the elongated haptic is placed under tension until its outer end is adjacent the optic, forming a loop, and the outer end of the haptic is then releasably attached to the optic, maintaining the tension and the loop. After implantation of the lens the outer end of the haptic is detached from the optic and, by virtue of the memory retaining characteristic thereof, the position fixation haptic returns toward its normal position extending outwardly from the optic, eliminating the loop.
