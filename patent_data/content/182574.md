# Penile implant.

## Abstract
A penile prosthesis 20, 200 comprising at least one cylinder 22 for implantation in the penis and including a front typ section 24 , an intermediate section 28 , and a rear tail section 26 . The intermediate section 28 includes at least one tubular member 46, 204 which is inflatable, and arranged to assume an elongated rigid and hard state from a flexible, flac cid state upon the application of an operating liquid 42 under pressure thereto. An expandable bellows 36 having an actuat ing fluid 38 therein is located in the tip section. The actuating fluid 38 expands from a first state to a second higher volume state upon the application of energy e.g., heat thereto. The ex pansion action causes an operating liquid 42 located in at least one reservoir 40, 222 to be provided under pressure to the inflatable tubular member 46, 204 in the intermediate sec tion to cause it to become erect. Upon the dissipation of said energy from the actuating fluid the bellows 36 contracts, whereupon the intermediate section 28 of the cylinder be comes flaccid again.
