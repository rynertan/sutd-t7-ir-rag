# Improvements in and or relating to the carriage of comestibles and in particular to containers and related means and methods suitable for such purposes.

## Abstract
A method and means for transporting a quantity of comes tibles preferably at lowered temperatures where at least con tinual monitoring of at least the oxygen level of the atmosphere to which the comestible is subjected is carried out. Preferably the carbon dioxide level is also monitored. Automatic adjustment of the oxygen content and carbon dioxide content in response to the monitoring is carried out using a positive infusion of ambient air and the scrubbing of the gas atmosphere to which the comest ibles are subjected respectively. Ideally the comestibles are of a respiring nature such as would be the case with plants whether cut or uncut , fruit and vegetables and they are carried in a container suitable for shipping where a seal of the container sufficient to ensure that less oxygen from the ambient air can diffuse into the container than is required for respiration by said quantity and sufficient to ensure a product of carbon dioxide by said quantity as a result of respiration than can diffuse from the container.
