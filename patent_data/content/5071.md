# Probe for electronic scanning type ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus.

## Abstract
A probe for electronic scanning type ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus has a linear array of similar electro acoustic transducers 2 1 to 2 N and one or more pseudo transducers 7 1, 7 2 arranged in a row. In order to equalize the ultrasonic directivity characteristics of each of the actual transducers, the pseudo transducers 7 1, 7 2 are arranged adjacent to the end transducers 2 1, 2 N , and have approximately the same shape and dimensions as the actual transducers 2 1 to 2 N .
