# Object detection installation.

## Abstract
In a vehicle detector installation employing an inductive sensing loop 14 that is a frequency determining element of an oscillator 10 , the oscillation 10 is provided with a vol tage controlled capacitor VC1 as another frequency deter mining element and is made the voltage controlled oscillator VC0 10 of a phase locked loop whereby the VC0 is locked to the reference frequency of a source 22 . The presence of a vehicle in the vicinity of the loop causes the capacitor voltage to vary to maintain lock. The varying voltage is applied to an auxiliary VC0 30 whose frequency is accordingly varied and may be anaylzed for vehicle detection purposes. The oscil lator 10 containing the sensing loop 14 is thereby pre vented from influencing nearby installations by the FM sidebands that would be produced in the absence of the fre quency locking. A group of such installations may use a common reference frequency source with each installation operating at its own locked frequency by virtue of means providing a programmable frequency division ratio from the source. Microcomputer control of the operation of the instal lations is disclosed using the clock source of the microcom puter as the reference frequency source. Each installation is provided with a counter for sampling its auxiliary oscillator frequency and the microcomputer is connected over a bus system to poll the counters, all vehicle detection analysis being performed by the microcomputer.
