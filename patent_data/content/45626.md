## Description
This invention has reference to pneumatic tube carrier systems.Pnuematic tube carrier systems have been known for many years and include a pair of tubes connecting a pair of stations and with an air supply to move a carrier through the tubes between the stations.Normally a carrier was sent from a point of sale to a control desk through one tube and returned to the point of sale through the other tube. It is also known to provide a ring tube system connected between several stations connected in a ring in which a carrier passes from one station to any one of the other stations in the ring. The carrier however always moves around the ring in one direction.It is also known to have a carrier tube system in which an air supply is arranged at one end of a system to move a carrier in one direction through the system under air pressure and to move a carrier in the other direction under vacuum. Thus inBritish Specification No. 855344 there is described a message transmission of the type comprising a system of transmission tracks including a main line and a plurality of branch lines and sub branch lines, means for supplying a transport mediun to convey a message carrier along the tracks, and means for controlling the passage of said carrier from a point of despatch to a point of reception in which the track is provided with switching members in the proximity of each branch line and or sub branch line.which switching members are actuated by the carrier during its travel along the track to alter its direction of motion, and to regulate the speed and direction of the transport medium, all in accordance with a pre determined routing schedule.Also in British Specification No.1406172 there is described a pneumatic tube system having a main tube and a series of branch tubes connected to the main tube there being diverters respectively at the junctions of the main tube and branch tubes and the branch tubes being provided with stations respectively for dispatching a carrier into and receiving the carrier from the system and each station having a circuit with meahs for selecting an address of a station to receive the carrier, the system also having a pump for supplying alternately vacuum and air pressure in thetubes and a control circuit for controlling operation of the pump and the diverters to direct movement of the carrier from one of the stations to another of the stations wherein the control circuit includes means for scanning the circuits of the stations while the carrier is moving from one of the stations to another of the stations to that addresses may be received in the control circuit for carrying out operations for moving a sub sequent carrier through the system. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved and simple pneumatic tube carrier system.According to the present invention a pneumatic tube carrier system comprises a pair of pneumatic tube carrier stations with a tube connecting the two stations, an air supply for alternatively supplying air under pressure or air under vacuum to a position in the tube between the two stations and valve means in each link of the tube between the respective stations and the position at which the air is supplied to the tube to cut off the air supplied to the tube between that valve and the corresponding station, and carrier detector means to detect a carrier said detector means being located between the air supply position and the respective valve means.Embodiments of pneumatic tube carrier systems in accordance with the present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawing wherein Fig.l is a diagram of a pneumatic tube systemFigs.2 and 3 are detailed viewsFig.4 is a view of a modified system and Fig.5 is a view of a further modified systemReferring to Fig.l of the drawings there is shown a pneumatic tube carrier system which comprises a pair of complementary stations, 1,2 capable of receiving a carrier despatched from the other complementary station or of despatching a carrier to that complementary station along a tube 3 joining the two stations.An air moving machine 4 which may be either an exhauster or a blower is connected to the line 3 through a reversing valve 5 at a junction position 3a. The reversing valve 5 is arranged to supply air under pressure or air under vacuum to the tube 3.As shown it is positioned at approximately half way between the two stations 1 and 2. Adjacent the position 3a at which the tube line 6 joining the tube 3 is located in each arm of the tube 3 a gate valve 7 which serves to control the supply of air to the tube between that valve and the station at the end of that part of the tube 3, either by allowing the air to flow freely through the valve or to cut off the flow of air.A detector switch 8 is positioned adjacent to the junction position 3a and so arranged that the detector means operates when a carrier has reached a position in the tube 3 adjacent the junction position 3a. The detector switch 8 is connected in an electric ControlCircuit not shown other control devices also not shown for example switches at each of the stations 1, 2 which are oprated when the carrier is ready to be despatched are also included in the control circuit. When a carrier is ready to be sent from, for example, station 2 to station 1, the carrier is inserted in the tube and a control switch at that station is operated to indicate that a carrier is ready to be despatched. If the tube is available operation of the control switch causes the machine 4 to move air and the reversing valve is positioned to supply air under vacuum to the tube 3. The valve 7 on the left hand side of the junction position 3a is open and the valve 7 of the right hand side of the junction position is closed. The carrier is pulled through the tube 3 and past the valve 7 on the left hand side of the junction position 3a until its position is sensed by the detector switch 8 adjacent juntion position 3a.This detection causes the reversing valve 5 to reverse to supply air under pressure to the tube 3 and causes the valve 7 on the right hand side of junction position 3a to open and the valve on the left hand side of the junction position 3a to close.The carrier is thereby moved by air under pressure to the station.Referring to Figs. 2 and 3 of the drawings there is shown a carrier passing down the part of the tube 3 adjacent the tube line 6 connected to the air moving machine 4. As the carrier approaches the junction the leading end of the carrier moves out of the left hand part of the tube 3 into the right hand part. The tube line 6 is below atmospheric pressure and the left hand side of the tube line behind the carrier is at substantially atmospheric pressure, whereas the right hand side of the tube 1 is at less than atmospheric pressure because the gate valve 7 is closed. Hence the front end of the carrier moves into the right hand side of the tube 1 as shown inFig. 3 with the trailing end of the carrier out of the left hand side of the tube 1 and probably the whole carrier being in the right hand side of the tube 1 beyond the tube line 6.When the air moving machine is switched to supply air under pressure, the valve 7 on the left hand side closes, and the valve on the right hand side opens, whereby the air in the tube assumes an air pressure higher than atmospheric pressure and the air pressure is applied either to the front rings on the carrier or if the carrier is beyond the tube line ss to the trailing rings on the carrier. Thus the carrier continues its movement towards the exit station. Referring to Fig.4 of the drawings, there is shown a modified system with a long tube 3 between stations.In accordance with known technology it is known to move carriers from one station to another when the stations are up to I kilometer apart. The present system can be adopted to a system in which a station is included at one end with a series of tube lines 6 with gate valves in the tube 1 on one side of the respective tube lines 6 and with intermediate parts of the tube connected together rather than to stations.Using the system as shown in Fig.4A the tube lines 6 can be connected intermediately on the tube lines at up to 1 kilometer apart. Also as shown in Fig.4B it is arranged that intermediate tube lines 6 are connected to the tube 3 instead of a station and the tube lines supply air under pressure or under vacuum to reinforce each other. Thus as shown in Fig.4B when a carrier moving from the station and passes the first tube line 6 air is supplied from the first tube line to the tube 1 under pressure and air is supplied from the second tube line to the tube 1 under vacuum. Using this technique it is possible to pass carriers through tubes with the tube lines spaced up to 2 kilometers apart.Referring to the embodiment shown in Fig.5 of the drawings there is shown an air moving machine and comprising a pair of motors with a fan similar to that used in a domestic vacuum cleaner one motor 4a being provided to supply air under vacuum and the other motor 4b being provided to supply air under pressure to the tube line 6 connected to the tube 3 at the junction position 3a. These motors 4a, 4b are operational under the control of a control means including a microprocessor speed regulating circuit which may be as described in the specification of our copending application for Patent No. Each end of the tube is provided with station 1,2 havina gutter portion and adjacent each gutter portion a photoelectric sensing device 4 is positioned to indicate that a carrier has just been inserted into the system or has been despatched to the other end of the tube and has reached its destination.Adjacent each station 1,2 a gate valve 7 is positioned.This gate valve is similar to the gate valve 7 shown in Fig.l and is operative to move from one position closed to the other position open by an electric motor. A short distance from the gate valve 7 is positioned an air escape tube 10 with a valve 12 in the tube 10. A detector switch 13 is positioned closely adjacent to the junction of the tubes 3 and 10.Similarly a detector switch 8 is positioned closely adjacent to the junction between the tube 3 and the tube line 6. These detector switches 8 and 9 detect the presence of a carrier passing through the tube 1.In operation of the system shown in Fig.5 the system starts with all valves closed. A carrier is inserted into the system at the station 1 and it is detected by the photoelectric sensing device 14. This sensing is passed to the control means which serves to control the opening of the gate valve 7, adjacent to the sending station. The motor 4a to supply air under vacuum to the tube 1 is switched on and the power to the motor 4a and hence the air under vacuum applied to the tube 3 increases in steps until the carrier moves. Movement of the carrier is detected by the photoelectric sensing device 14 and by the detector switch 13 adjacent the sending station and a signal is sent to the control means 15 to apply full power to the motor 4a and open the valve 12 and closes the valve 7. lsEen the carrier reaches the detector switch 8 the switch initiates slfitching off of the power to the motor 4a and applies power after a delay of 2 to 3 seconds to the motor 2 and to supply air under pressure to the tube 1 and to cldse the valve 12 on the left hand side and open the valve 12 on the right hand side. The carrier is then propelled along the tube by air under full pressure until the carrier reaches the detector switch 13 adjacent to the exit station. The carrier is retarded because the gate 7 is closed and a barrier of air is formed before the gate.The valve 12 is closed and the gate 5 adjacent to the exit station is opened and the motor 4b is re energised at the same or equivalent power as when the carrier started to move.The carrier is moved to the station 2 until the trailing end of carrier moves out of the tube and stops.
