# Sampled data 1 PD control apparatus.

## Abstract
A sampled data I PD control apparatus controls an interfer ence multi input multi output process in accordance with an I PD action. The apparatus comprises an identification signal generator 28 for superposing persistently exciting identification signals on control variables inputs or the process 10 , an identifying circuit 32 for identifying a pulse transfer function of the process 10 in accordance with the control variables of the process 10 and controlled variables outputs of the process 10 , an S transfer function calculator 34 for transforming the identified pulse transfer function to an S transfer function, and a tuning circuit 36 for matching the S transfer function with that of a process model and for tuning sampled data I PD control parameters in accordance with a matching result.
