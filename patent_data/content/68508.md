# Methanol fuel cell.

## Abstract
A methanol fuel cell wherein a positive electrode 2 and a negative electrode 1 are disposed in contact with a solid film 3 which exhibits a hydrogen ion and or hydronium ion conductivity. The methanol permeability coefficient of the solid film 3 of the methanol fuel cell is at most 1 10 ⁶ mol mol ℓ .min.cm².
