## Description
PROSTAGLANDIN D DERIVATIVES, PROCESS FOR THEIRPREPARATION AND COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM The present invention relates to novel prostaglandin D analogues, to processes for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Prostaglandins are derivatives of prostanoic acid having the following structure EMI1.1 Various types of prostaglandins are known, and their types depend on the structure of the alicyclic ring and the substituents. For example, the alicyclic rings of prostaglandins F PGF , E PGE and D PGD have the following structures,EMI1.2 In the above structural formulae or in the other structural formulae in this specification, according to the generally accepted nomenclature, the dotted line indicates that the substituent attached thereto is behind the ring plane, i. e., is of the a configuration, the bold line indicates that the substituent attached thereto is in front of the ring plane, i.e., is of the ss configuration, and the wavy line indicates that the substituent attached thereto is of the a configuration or the ss configuration or a mixture thereof. These compounds are sub classified according to the positions of the double bonds in the side chains attached to the alicyclic ring at the 8 position and the 12 position. The PG 1 compound has a trans double bond trans 13 between C13 C14 and the PG 2 compound has a cis double bond between C5 C6 and a trans double bond between C13 C14 cis 5, trans 13 .For example, prostaglandin D1 PGD1 and prostaglandin D2 PGD2 may be expressed by the following structural formulae, respectively EMI2.1 Further, when one or more methylene groups are removed from the aliphatic group attached at the 12 position of the alicyclic ring of a prostaglandin, said compound is known as a nor prostaglandin according to the general rule of the organic nomenclature, and the number of the removed methylene groups is indicated by adding di , tri , etc.before the prefix nor . The prostaglandins generally have pharmacological properties. For example, they exert various effects including the stimulation of contraction of smooth muscles, a hypotensive effect, a diuretic effect, a bronchial dilation effect, the inhibition of lypolysis, the inhibition of platelet aggregation and the inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, they are useful in treatments of hypertension, thrombosis, asthma and gastric and intestinal ulcers, in the induction of labor and abortion in pregnant mammals, in the prevention of arteriosclerosis and also as diuretics. They are liposoluble substances present in extremely small quantities in the tissues which secrete prostaglandins in vivo in animals. As a result of research and experimentation to discover novel compounds which have the pharmacological effects of the natural prostaglandins, or which have one or more of these properties to an enhanced degree, or which have properties which are not found in the natural prostaglandins, it has been found that novel PGD1 analogues in which an oxo group i.e. 0 has been introduced onto the carbon atom at the 6 position of PGD1 and certain derivatives thereof 6 keto PGD1 derivatives , further novel PGD derivatives in which, in addition, the hydroxy group attached to the carbon atom at the 15 position of these compounds has been removed to introduce double bonds between C12 C13 and between C14 C15, and further novelPGD derivatives in which the hydroxy group attached to the carbon atom at the 9 position of these compounds has been removed to introduce a cis double bond between Cg C10 have a surprisingly strong anti tumor effect whereas they have no or only very weak pharmacological properties possessed by the natural prostaglandins. Heretofore, there have been filed several patent applications relating to PGD analogues. For example, compounds wherein various substituents have been introduced into the side chain attached to the 12 position are disclosed in the specification of United States PatentNo. 4,016,184 Derwent No. 24680Y , and further compounds in which the carboxy group at the l position of PGD analogues has been replaced by various functional groups are disclosed in the specifications of United StatesPatent Nos. 4,346,228, 4,028,419, 4,055,602, 4,032,576, 4,123,463 and British Patent Nos. 1554041 and 1554042 see Derwent Nos. 81216X, 43349Y, 48794Y, 48793Y, 81996A, 46957Y and 46957 , respectively. However, none of the above applications discloses the 6 keto PGD1 derivatives of the present invention which include, of course, such derivatives wherein a hydroxy group at the 15 position or both hydroxy groups at the 9 and 15 poQitions have been removed to introduce one or two double bonds. Furthermore, in addition to their structural differences from known PGD compounds, the compounds of the present invention have an effect which has not hitherto been found in the known PGD analogues, that is, an antitumor effect. The above described Patent specifications describe only the pharmacological properties known with the natural prostaglandins and none of the applications refers to an anti tumor effect.

For example, the step a can be conducted by reacting with a boric acid corresponding toR5, for example, phenylboric acid PhB H 2 or butylboric acid n BuB OH 2 , in an inert organic solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride or tetrahydrofuran in the presence of molecular sieves 3A or 4A at reflux temperature see J.C.S. Chem. Comm., page 658 1975 and Prostaglandins, Vol. 9, page 109 1975 . The step b can be conducted using e.g. 2,3dihydropyran, 2,3 dihydrofuran, ethyl vinyl ether, in an inert organic solvent, for example, methylene chloride, chloroform or diethyl ether, in the presence of a condensing agent, for example, p toluenesulphonic acid, sulfuric acid or trifluoroacetic acid at a temperature of from room temperature to 30 C. Preferably, it is conducted using 2,3 dihydropyran in methylene chloride in the presence of pyridinium p toluenesulfonate or p toluenesulfonic acid at room temperature. The step c can be conducted by reacting with an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution in an aqueous solution of an alkanol of 1 4 carbon atoms, for example, aqueous methanol or ethanol, at a temperature of not higher than 600C, preferably at 45 50 C. The products of steps a , b and c can be used, without purification, in subsequent steps. In the sequence of the reaction steps illustrated by the above scheme, the compound of the general formula XII employed as the starting material is known as a PGF2 3 derivative and can be produced by converting the OR3 groups at the ll position and the 15 position of a compound of the general formula EMI23.1 wherein the various symbols are as hereinbefore defined, to hydroxy groups under the reaction conditions employed in the hydrolysis of compounds of general formula VII to compounds of general formulae Ia and Ib . The compounds of general formula XIII can be prepared by the application or adaptation of known methods, for example R12 1 when the grouping R represents a pentyl group, as described in J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 91, 5675 1969 or ibid, 92, 397 1970 2 when the grouping R1 R2 represents an alkyl group, as described in Japanese Patent Kokai Nos. 42675 72, 54068 73, 64073 73, 124048 74, 95250 75, 96543 75 and 101340 75, British Patent Specification Nos. 1398291, 1483240 and 1540427, United States Patent Specification No. 4024174, and Belgian Patent No. 850084 3 when R2 of the grouping R1 R2 3 when represents a cycloalkyl group, as described in Japanese Patent KokaiNos. 109353 74, 95250 75, 96543 75, 123647 75, 148339 75, 122040 76, 125256 76, 27753 77 and 25544 78, BritishPatent Specification Nos. 1464916, 1488141, 1483240, 1484210 and 1545213, United States Patent Specifications Nos.3966792, 4034003, 4024174, 4045468 and 4087620, and BelgianPatent No. 844256 4 when R2 of the grouping R1 R2 4 when represents a phenyl group or a phenoxy group, as described in JapanesePatent Kokai Nos. 95250 75, 96543 75, 59841 76, 101961 76 and 25745 77, British Patent Specifications Nos. 1483240 and1521747, United States Patent Specification Nos.4024174 and 4065632, and Belgian Patent No. 845348. Cyclodextrin clathrates of the prostaglandin D derivatives of general formula I can be prepared by known methods using a , 3 or Y cyclodextrin or a mixture thereof, for example using the process described in the specifications of United States Patent Nos. 3,816,393 and 4,054,736. Conversion into their cyclodextrin clathrates serves to increase the stability of the prostaglandin D derivatives of the invention. The prostaglandin derivatives of general formula I wherein R represents a hydrogen atom may, if desired, be converted by known methods into salts. Preferably the salts are non toxic salts. By the term non toxic salts as used in this specification is meant salts the cations of which are relatively innocuous to the animal organism when used in therapeutic. doses so that the beneficial pharmacological properties of the compound of general formula I are not vitiated by side effects caused by these cations. The salts are preferably water soluble.Suitable salts include for example salts of alkali metals such as sodium or potassium, salts of alkaline earth metals such as calcium or magnesium, ammonium salts and pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic amine salts. Amines suitable for forming such salts with a carboxylic acid are well known and include, for example, amines derived in theory by the replacement of one or more of the hydrogen atoms of ammonia by groups, which may be the same or different when more than one hydrogen atom is replaced, selected from, for example, alkyl groups containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and hydroxyalkyl groups containing 2 or 3 carbon atoms. Suitable non toxic amine salts are, e.g., tetraalkylammonium, such as tetramethylammonium, salts, and other organic amine salts such as methylamine salts, ethylamine salts, isopropylamine salts, tert butylamine salts, dimethylamine salts, cyclopentylamine salts, benzylamine salts, phenethylamine salts, piperidine salts, monoethanolamine salts, diethanolamine salts, lysine salts or arginine salts. Salts may be prepared from the acids of general formula I wherein R represents a hydrogen atom, by known methods, for example by reaction of stoichiometric quantities of an acid of general formula I and the appropriate base, e.g. an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide or carbonate, ammonium hydroxide, ammonia or an organic amine, in a suitable solvent. The salts may be isolated by lyophilisation of the solution or, if sufficiently insoluble in the reaction medium, by filtration, if necessary, after removal of part of the solvent. The prostaglandin D derivatives of general formula I , and, when R in general formula I represents a hydrogen atom, non toxic salts thereof, and cyclodextrin clathrates thereof either do not show the pharmacological effects typical of other prostaglandins, for example, hypotensive activity, inhibition of platelet aggregation, stimulation of uterine muscles and the production of diarrhoea or these effects are very weak. In contrast the anti tumor effect of the compounds of the invention is extremely strong and moreover their toxicity is extremely low. They may therefore be employed as very effective anti tumor agents in the prevention or therapy of tumors, for example, leukemia and solid cancer, including treatment to produce remission thereof. In a laboratory in vitro test on the inhibition of proliferation of human myelogenous leukemic cells HL 60 , the compounds of the present invention showed an inhibiting effect. The experimental method and the results are described below.Test on Inhibition of Proliferation Using Human MyelogenousLeukemic Cells HL 60 Experimental Method The test on the inhibition of proliferation of human myelogenous leukemic cells was conducted by a wellknown method. The human myelogenous leukemic cells HL 60 were added to an RPMI culture solution containing 10 bovine fetal serum, the number of cells in the culture solution was adjusted to 1 x 105 cells ml, a solution in ethanol of the compound under test was added to give a concentration of 5 Xg ml, and the mixture was subjected to stationary culture at 370C for 4 days. As a control, a culture solution to which 0.1 of ethanol had been added was similarly cultured.After the cultivation, the culture solutions were stained by the Trypan Blue staining method and the surviving cell number was measured to determine the percentage inhibition relative to the control.The results are given in the following Table.
