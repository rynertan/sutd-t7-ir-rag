## Description
VEHICLE WINDOW ASSEMBLY This invention relates to window assemblies for vehicles. It has been common in vehicle manufacturing procedures to use a piecemeal assembly operation to install a window. Thus, a bead of sealant or the like is applied around the frame of a window, a pane of glass is pressed against the sealant and several clips or fasteners are secured around the glass edge to the surrounding frame to hold the glass in place. Thereafter, decorative covers or frames are placed around the frame or glass edge to dress the edge and cover the fastening area. As will be appreciated, such assembly procedures are time consuming and expensive. They may also be prone to sealing problems should the bead of sealant not be applied properly or the fasteners be loose or otherwise improperly installed. More recent forms of unitary window assemblies have been devised for installation directly from the exterior of a vehicle. Such assemblies, like that shown in United States Patent 4,072,340, have included a pane of glass, an adjacent frame, and 6 casing or gasket of moulded material, such as polyvinyl chloride, extending between the frame and the peripheral edge of the window which holds the pane and frame together.Fasteners are provided at spaced locations along the frame such that the entire assembly can be guided into location over an opening in a vehicle body as a unit with the fasteners extending through apertures provided in the body and secured in a single operation from the interior of the vehicle body. Alternatively, window assemblies,. such as that shown in United States Patent 4,139,234, have included a moulded casing or gasket around the edge of a pane of glass with fasteners moulded in and projecting from the casing or gasket for attachment purposes. Such prior unitary window assemblies have recently come under close scrutiny because of increased concern over weight reduction and fuel efficiency in automobiles and other vehicles. The relatively heavy frame, typically cast from zinc or other metal and or the moulded gasket or casing for securing the frame to the window provide significant weight in each window assembly. In addition, as in the structure of U.S. 4,072,340, the decorative frame, which requires the inclusion of fastening means therealong to secure the entire assembly in a vehicle, requires expensive casing techniques making the frame members relatively expensive. With the focus on weight reduction and economies in designing new vehicles, it was desired that window assemblies be lighter in weight and less expensive, yet retain rigidity, strength and structural integrity.The present invention helps solve the above problems while maintaining thestrength, decorative trim function, sealing function and desirable fastening characteristics of previously known unitary or modular window assemblies. According to one aspect of the present invention a window assembly for vehicles adapted for installation as a unit to close an opening in the vehicle body com prises a window pane having front, back and peripheral edge surfaces and a decorative trim frame around the periphery of the window pane, characterised in that the frame includes a flange covering an area adjacent the peripheral edge of the window pane, securing means for securing the frame to the panel mechanically, or by an adhesive, or otherwise, and attaching means secured to at least one surface of the window for fastening the window assembly to an adjacent support, the attaching means being concealed from view when the assembly is viewed from the direction of the front surface.Such a lightweight, economical window assembly especially adapted for use in vehicles and designed to be assembled as a. unit, preferably from the vehicle exterior, readily providing concealed fastening of the assembly which is undetectable from the vehicle exterior, while also providing all necessary decorative trim and sealing functions in a one step assembly procedure.The assembly cannot easily be removed from the exterior after assembly without disconnecting the fasteners and is, therefore, essentially tamper proof, it is light in weight because of the minimal decorative frame or trim necessary to cover the peripheral edge of the glass, and is economical to manufacture and install. The attaching means are preferably secured to the pane behind the frame and within the projection of the covering area adjacent the peripheral edge. The securing means preferably include a frame portion engaging the back surface of the window pane such that the frame is clamped over the peripheral edge surface. The frame may be formed from resilient material such that the peripheral edge surface and back surface engaging portions are outwardly bendable but snap back into position around the peripheral edge surfaces the back surface frame engaging portion including camming means for urging the peripheral edge surface and back surface engaging portions of the frame outwardly around the peripheral edge surface when engaged with the peripheral edge surface.In a preferred embodiment the decorative frame is moulded from a resinous material around the peripheral edge surface of the window pane such that the moulded frame engages at least portions of the front, back and peripheral edge surfaces of the window pane. The decorative frame may include a bendable metallic core enveloped in av resilient, resinous covering material the frame including a bent portion engaging the back surface of the window pane such that the frame is clamped over the peripheral edge surface of the window pane.Preferably the frame includes spacing means for engaging a portion of a vehicle against which the assembly is adapted to be fitted and spacing the assembly a predetermined distance away from that vehicle portion.Preferably a compressible sealant is applied to at least portions of the back surface of the window pane adjacent the peripheral edge surface. The compressible sealant material may suitably be a bead of butyl sealer extending over and engaging portions of the attaching means and decorative frame. According to a second aspect of the present inven tion a vehicle body includes means defining a window opening for receiving a window assembly characterised by a window assembly and fastening means engaging the attaching means for retaining the window assembly on the vehicle body. Preferably sealing means is included between the window assembly and the vehicle body for preventing entry of water or contaminants therebetween. The invention may be carried into. practice in various ways but a number of vehicle window assemblies embodying the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a front perspective view of a vehicle window assembly Figure 2 is a broken perspective view of the interior of the window assembly shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a perspective view of a typical vehicle body window opening over which the window assembly shown in Figures 1 and 2 is designed to be fitted and illustrating a fragmentary portion of the window assembly fitted therein Figure 4 is a sectional, exploded side elevation of an alternative window assembly Figure 5 is a sectional side elevation of the window assembly of Figure 4 shown in its assembled condition Figure 6 is a sectional side elevation of the window assembly of Figures 4 and 5 secured in a vehicle body and covered by a decorative interior housing Figure 7 is a fragmentary, exploded sectional side elevation of a modified form of an attaching stud for the assembly of the present invention Figure 8 is a fragmentary, sectional side elevation of a further window assembly Figure 9 is a fragmentary, sectional side elevation of another form of the window assembly including a decorative, metallic snap on trim assembly Figure 10 is a sectional side elevation of yet another form of the window assembly including another form of metallic trim assembly Figure 11 is a sectional side elevation of a further form of window assembly including a moulded plastic trim member bonded to the window pane Figure 12 is a sectional side elevation of an alternative form of window assembly including a snap on plastic trim assembly Figure 13 is a sectional side elevation of a window assembly including a moulded trim member which is injection moulded around the window pane Figure 14 is a sectional side elevation of a window assembly like that in Figures 1 to 3 including a moulded plastic trim member having arcuately formed retaining tab.thereon and Figure 15 is yet another form of the window assembly including the combination metal plastic trim member having bendable retaining tabs holding that member in place on the window pane. Referring now to the drawings in greater detail, a first embodiment 10 of a window assembly for a vehicle is shown in Figures 1 and 2 and includes three primary components, namely, a window pane 12 which is cut to shape, bent or formed to the vehicle body contour as desired, and thereafter tempered, a surrounding or enclosing decorative frame member or bezel 14, and at least one attaching member or fastener 16 secured directly to the window pane 12. As will be more fully explained below, attaching studs or fasteners 16 are preferably mechanically bonded directly to a surface of the glass, such as the rear surface as shown in Figure 2, with an appropriate adhesive bonding composition which rigidly and securely attaches the metallic stud or fastener to the glass surface.As shown in Figures 2 and 3, a bead of butyl sealant 18 may be applied around the edge of the window pane 12 and covered with a wax paper covering strip 19 to protect and prevent the sealant from becoming dirty or contaminated during shipment of the window assembly to a vehicle manufacturing location. Alternatively, the butyl sealant bead 18 may be applied around the pinch flange of the window opening in the vehicle body to which the assembly is adapted to be installed as shown in Figure 3. Such window assemblies are preferably designed for fixing stationary windows in vehicle body openings directly from the exterior such that only a simple fastening of one or more nuts or fasteners over the attaching studs from the interior is necessary. A typical window opening, over which a correspondingly shaped assembly such as that shown in Figures 1 and 2 is fastened in an automobile or other vehicle, is shown in Figure 3. spaced apertures 20 are provided at locations along the pinch weld flange of the sheet metal body work of the vehicle and are aligned with the attaching studs 16 such that the studs will project therethrough when the assembly is fitted over the opening. As shown in Figure 2, a decorative trim frame 14 is assembled to the window pane 12 by a series of spaced, arcuate or rolled retaining tabs or flanges 22 which engage the rear surface of the window pane and hold the front flange 14a of the frame to the front surface of the window pane. The flanges 22 are heated and roll formed into position with suitable forming apparatus. In addition to front flange 14a retaining the window pane 12, the trim, which in this case is formed from a resinous plastic material, includes an outwardly extending flange 14b which extends under the assembly and presses outwardly against a shoulder 23 of the vehicle body window aperture as is best seen in Figure 3. The flange 14b, together with the butyl sealant 18, effectively seals out dust, water and other foreign matter. from the interior of the vehicle body when the assembly 10 is fastened in place. Figures 4,5 and 6 illustrate a similar but slightly modified form 24 window assembly as compared to that shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3. In this case, the window pane 12 is fastened to a modified decorative trim or frame 25 which is generally T shaped and includes a flange 26 directed inwardly toward the assembly, a flange 28 directed outwardly away from the assembly, and a securing flange 30 extending generally at right angles to the flanges 26, 28. The flange 26 is spaced from a front surface 12b of the pane 12 and extends inwardly from the peripheral edge 12a of the pane 12 a specified distance ending in a tapered, rearwardly inclined flange 26a designed to engage the front surface 12b of the pane 12 at that specified distance from the peripheral edge 12a.The corner of the pane 12, between the front surface 12b and the peripheral edge surface 12a, eDn ages the junction between a beveled surface 26b and the flange 30 such that the corner of the pane is securely retained against that junction. The flange 28 is designed to extend over and seal against the vehicle body metal work as shown in Figure 6 to help exclude water around the assembly when installed on the vehicle. The entire decorative trim or frame member 25 is preferably formed, in this instance, from an injection moulded polycarbonate or similar resinous plastic which is sufficiently rigid and durable to retain its shape and integrity in the environmental conditions to which vehicles are subjected. The trim member 25 is bonded to the peripheral edge of surface 2a of the window pane using a suitable adhesive such as an epoxy, polyurethane or silicone adhesive, while the flange 30 extends beyond the rear surface 12c of the window pane and forms a stop or abutment which engages the pinch weld flange 21 of the vehicle body and limits the insertion of the assembly. On the opposite or rear surface 12c of the window pane 12 from the flange 26 of the trim member or frame 25 is fastened a metal stud 32 including an integral metal base 34, which may be rectangular as shown, circular, or another shape, secured by welding or the like to a projecting, threaded shaft or fastener 36 A best seen in Figures 5 and 6. The studs 32, of which there may be one or more in any assembly, are preferably formed from ferromagnetic metal and fastened immediately adjacent the peripheral edge surface 12a on the rear surface 12c of the pane 12 by means of a suitable metal to glass adhesive or bonding agent of which several are commercially available. A preferred adhesive system found suitable for attachment of studs 32 directly to glass, and especially tempered glass, is that marketed under the trademark Tenabond by Illinois Tool Works, Inc. ofElgin, Illinois. Such a system is believed to include an epoxy adhesive layer 38, as shown in Figures 4, 5 and 6, typically applied in tape form to a base 34 of the stud 32. The base 34 of the stud 32 and the adhesive layer 38 are pressed against the rear surface 12c of the pane 12 and heated rapidly using an induction heating apparatus of the type shown in any one of United States Patent Nos. 3,816,690, 4,032,740, 4,163,884 or 4,167,259 which activates the adhesive and causes the stud to be rigidly and securely bonded by what is believed to be a mechanical bond directly to the glass surface. Such induction heated adhesives more securely bond metal to glass than do cold, unheated adhesives. Moreover, the induction heating system provides localized heat which is sufficiently intense to properly activate the adhesive without affecting the temper of the glass to which the stud is being applied. Accordingly, the strength and integrity of the glass to which the stud is bonded is not effected by the heating and the resultant metal glass assembly is stronger and more durable than with other adhesives. Tests performed on an 8 32 threaded stud having a 322.58 adhesive product No. TP 8051, have shown that such a bonded stud can remain strongly and securely attached to the glass even after exposure to the environmental conditions to which an automobile or other vehicle is typically exposed. In the above testing, the bonded stud was subjected to 20 cycles of alternating hot and cold temperatures, specifically two hours at 400C 40 F followed by five hours at 87.80C 1900F . The bonded stud exhibited a shear strength of 3.164 x 105 kg m2 450 p.s.i. although it did let loose very slightly and a tensile strength of 7.814 x 105 kg m2 1120 p.s.i. after such cycling.When subjected to seven days exposure. to 95 relative humidity at 37.80C 1000F followed by seven days exposure to 100 relative humidity at 17.80C 0 F , the bonded stud exhibited a shear strength of 3.937 x 105 kg m2 560 p.s.i. without loosening and a tensile strength of 8.015 x 105 kg m2 1140 p.s.i. .When exposed to ultraviolet light simulated sunlight for seven days, the bonded stud exhibited a shear strength of 5.203 x 105 kg m2 740 p.s.i. although it did let loose very slightly . The tensile strength after this exposure could not be accurately measured because the glass shattered when tensile testing was attempted. When soaked in 37.80C 1000F water for two hours, the bonded stud exhibited a shear strength of greater than 2.812 x 105 kg mê t400 p.s.i. and a tensile strength between 8.437 x 105 105 kg m 1280 p.s.i. Several different bonded studs were tested as described above, and the above values are considered typical of all.of the samples tested. Therefore, such environmental testing indicates that the Tenabond bonded studs maintain a bond strength greater than that required for retention in a vehicle and are fully capable of being properly retained in high and low t peratures, high humidity conditions, and after expose to ultraviolet light simulated sunlight . Other suitable adhesives for metal tt glass bonds useful in the present invention include aerobic polyacrylate cement such as that disclose in UnitedStates Patent 3,885,072, vinyl acetate pbanol formaldehyde containing adhesive such as that disclosed in United States Patent 2,502,970, or epoxy containing cement such as that disclosed in CanadianPatent 702 r 57 8. After assembly of the stud 32 at app opriate locations on the glass using one of the c mesiva systems mentioned above, the assembly may be completed by applying a bead or strip 18 of butyl sealant adjacent the peripheral edge surface 12a along the rear surface 12c of the window pane as shown Figure 5.The sealant 18 may be covered with a wax taper strip 19 to prevent its contamination during shipment of the assembly to a manufacturing location. Thereafter, the strip 19 may be removed from the butyl sealant 18 and the assembly applied by inserting the fasteners or studs 32 through appropriately located apertures 20 in the pinch weld flange 21 and applying retaining nuts 40 over the studs such that the assembly is drawn tightly against the flange 21 with the end of the decorative trim flange 30 abutting against the exterior of the flange 21. This procedure compresses the butyl sealant 18 between the rear surface of the window pane 12 and around the stud 32 to form an effective seal against the entry of water and other contaminants to the interior of the vehicle as shown in Figure 6. As will be understood from Figure 6, the fastening area including butyl sealant 18 is concealed when the assembly is viewed from the exterior of the vehicle and the window assembly because the flange 26 of the trim member 25 covers the attachment area of the stud 32 to the window glass 12. If desired, and in most situations, a decorative plastic or other cover 42 may be applied and secured over the fastening area around the interior of the pinch weld flange to conceal the fastening of the window assembly in place as shown in Figure 6. With reference to Figure 7, alternative arrangements may be employed to secure attaching fasteners or studs directly to the window glass. In Figure 7, one alternative includes an attachment stud 44 having aJ shaped attaching base 46 extending around the peripheral edge 12a of the window glass.The layer 38 of adhesive suitable for bonding the metallic stud 44 and its base 46 to the window glass 12 is applied between the interior surfaces of the base 46 including a front flange 46a, a peripheral edge flange or side 46b, and a rear flange or surface 4 6c. The stud 44 is heated for activation of the adhesive as described above in the Tenabond system. Securement of the flanges 46a and 46b, which are not present in the stud 32 described above, makes the overall assembly to which the stud 44 is attached stronger.As an alternative, it would be possible to merely place studs, such as those shown at 44, around the peripheral edge of the glass 12 and. secure them in place with a suitable decorative trim or frame, or perhaps such a frame in combination with a bead of butyl sealant 18, to prevent them from shifting along the peripheral edge surface of the glass. In such case, the front flange 46a would hold the stud to the glass and allow the entire assembly to be retained to a pinch weld flange 21 such as that shown in Figure 6. Other modified forms of attachment fasteners could be used besides those shown in Figures 1 to 7. Thus, a metallic, plastic or other channel member may be fitted along an entire edge of a window pane with studs projecting at spaced locations therefrom toward the vehicle. Alternatively, base members such as those shown at 46 in Figure 7 could be connected by appropriate metallic or other webbing so that the location of the attaching studs could be appropriately maintained. Although the window assembly of the present invention is typically applied directly to a metallic pinchweld flange of a vehicle body, it may also be secured to an intermediate decorative panel such as that shown at 50 in Figure 8. In this assembly, wherein like numerals indicate like parts to those described above, a window assembly embodiment 52 includes a modified decorative trim or frame member 54 including a moulded, polycarbonate resinous plastic front flange 56 and a series of metal tabs or flanges 58 riveted or swaged over plastic rivets to the rear surface of the front flange 56. The flange 56 is generally spaced from the front surface of the glass 12 but is inclined to and engages the glass at its inner edge.Metal retaining flanges 58 are bent upwardly to enclose the peripheral edge of the glass 12 such that the flanges 58 engage the peripheral edge surface as well as the rear surface of the glass. The studs 32, which are bonded or adhered directly to a surface of the glass 12 as described above, and concealed from view when installed by the flange 56, are inserted through aligned apertures in an extending, recessed flange 62 of a moulded intermediate panel 60 forming the major portion of the decorative intermediate panel 50 mentioned above. The panel 60 is preferably moulded from a plastic material such as polycarbonate or similar resinous plastic and is covered with a layer of decorative vinyl 64 having a backing 66 of urethane foam or the like. The decorative panel assembly forms a spacer between the window assembly 52 and the pinchweld flange 21 surrounding the window assembly as shown in Figure 8.The panel 60 also includes a series of spaced, rearwardly extending projections 68 in which are secured during the mouldingprocess rectilinear, threaded studs 70 which extend from the projection 68 and are designed to extend through apertures in the pinch weld flange 21 and to be secured by nuts 40 in a manner similar to the securement of stud 32 through the flange 62. In this embodiment, the foam backing 66 of the decorative vinyl 64 engages the vehicle body to form a seal from the exterior. Butyl sealant 18, behind the window assembly 52, and the engagement of bevelled surface 57 of the front flange 56 of decorative trim or frame 54 with a vinyl covered surface of the intermediate panel assembly 50, together form another seal against water, dirt, and other contaminants. A decorative overlay or panel 42 may be used to cover the fasteners on the interior of the vehicle. As mentioned above, numerous varities of decorative trim or frame members can be used in the present inve n tion. Several embodiments of those are shown in Figures 9 to . 15 wherein like numerals indicate like Darts to those described above. Although not shown in Figures 9 to 15, each of the window assembly embodiments shown therein includes attaching studs or fasteners, such as those shown in Figures 4 to7, which retain the assembly to the pinch weld flange 21 which is shown in the figures. Such studs may be attached with appropriate adhesive systems or secured around the peripheral edge of the glass as described above. In Figure 9, a window assembly embodiment 72 includes a stamped metallic trim frame 74 including a front flange 76 which is spaced outwardly from the front surface of the glass 12 but engages that front surface via inwardly directed sections 75, 77. The front flange 76 extends continuously into a series of spaced retaining tabs 78 which are designed to be snapped over the peripheral edge surface of the glass. The outer ends of the retaining tabs 78 include glass engaging areas 80 which engage both the peripheral edge surface and the rear surface of the glass, as well as a camming surface 82 which is designed to engage the corner between the front and peripheral edge surfaces of the glass when the trim is being applied to force the retaining tab 78 outwardly and allow it to be snapped into position.Retaining tabs 78 thus prevent the trim from sliding towards the centre of the glass or from being pulled outwardly away from the front of the glass. Butyl sealant 18 compresses around the areas 80, 82 of the retaining tabs when the assembly is fastened in place as shown in Figure 9. In Figure 10, an embodiment 84 of the window assembly also includes a stamped metallic trim or frame 86 having a front flange 88 of different ornamental design but also including areas 85, 87 which space that front flange from the front surface of the glass 12.Spot welded to the outside of a flange portion 89 of the frame 86 paralleling the peripheral edge surface is an outwardly extending flange 90 which engages the vehicle body to finish off and seal the assembly around the vehicle body. Also spot welded to the inside surface of the flange 89 are a series of retaining tabs 92 which include peripheral edge engaging, curved flanges 94 and rear glass engaging flanges 96. Both of the trim members 74 , 86 shown in Figures 9 and 10 are formed from resilient metallic materials enabling retaining flanges 78, 92 to bend and snap back into position to hold the trim frame in place. As shown in Figures 11, 12 and 14, remoulded decorative trim or frame members 102, 114 and 132 respectively can also be used and secured to and around the peripheral edge of the window pane 12 in various ways. In Figure 11, an embodiment 100 of the window assembly includes a preformed, polycarbonate bezel or frame member 102 including a front flange 104 and an outwardly extending flange 106 designed to engage the vehicle body as a sealing member. An inwardly extending flange 108 and a portion of the flange 104 are chemically bonded to the front and peripheral edge surfaces of the window glass 12 by means of a suitable epoxy, polyurethane or silicone adhesive. In the case of the embodiment 100, the front flange 104 contacts the front surface of the window from the peripheral edge surface outwardly to its free end. In Figure 12, a slightly modified moulded trim frame or bezel 114 is shown in a window assembly 112.The trim bezel or frame 114 includes a front flange 116 which contacts the front surface of the window glass 12 only at its free edge, and an outwardly extending flange 118 which engages the vehicle body for sealing purposes. An inwardly extending retaining flange 120 includes spaced ridges 122 which extend substantially parallel totheback surface of the glass 12 and include sloped orbeveiledcamming surfaces 124 designed to engage the corner between the front surface and peripheral edge surface of the window glass to pivot the resilient flange 120 outwardly when the trim frame or bezel 114 is snapped in place around the window glass.The flange 120 also includes a series of protruding stop members 126 which space the trim frame or bezel 114, and thus the entire assembly 112, at the proper distance from the exterior surface of the pinch weld flange 21. In Figure 14, a window assembly embodiment 130 includes a decorative trim frame or bezel 132 having a front flange 134 similar to those shown in embodiments 100 and 112 and an outwardly extending flange 136 which engages the vehicle body for sealing purposes.The frame 132 is retained around the peripheral edge of the window 12 by means of a series of spaced, rolled or arcuately curved retaining tabs 138 similar to the tabs 22 in assembly 10 which are heat formed such that their free end edges contact and are parallel to the rear surface of the glass 12 as shown in Figure 14.Between the rolled or arcuately formed retaining tabs 138, the remainder of the inwardly extending flange of the trim frame 132 forms a series of stop members 139 functioning similarly to the flange 30 in Figures 4 to 6 and projecting members 126 in Figure 12 to space the window assembly properly from the pinch weld flange 21. In Figure 13, a window assembly embodiment 140 includes a decorative trim frame or bezel 142 moulded in place around the front, back and peripheral edge surfaces of the window glass 12 from polyvinyl chloride in an injection moulding apparatus. The trim frame includes a front flange 144, an outwardly extending vehicle body engaging flange 146, a rear glass surface engaging a flange 148, and a spacer or stop member 150.for positioning the assembly against the pinch weld flange 21. Also, an optional, metallic insert 152 may be moulded in place in the trim member 142 for decorative purposes. An insert 152 includes a flange 154 extending generally parallel to the peripheral edge surface for retention of the insert in the moulded trim member. In Figure 15, yet. another embodiment 160 of the window assembly includes a combination metal resilent plastic trim member 162 bent around the peripheral edge of the window glass 12. In this embodiment, the trim member has a bendable metallic core 164 around which is moulded a sheath or covering of simulated rubber or other resilient, flexible resinous plastic material. The trim member 162, like the others described above, includes a front flange 166, a vehicle body engaging flange 168, and rear glass surface engaging flanges or tabs 170 at spaced locations. The frame member 162, however, need not engage the peripheral edge surface of window pane 12 for retention purposes. Accordingly, it will be understood that in each of the vehicle window assembly embodiments described herein, the fasteners are concealed from view from the front or exterior side of the installed window assembly principally because the attachment area of the studs or fasteners to the glass is hidden behind the front flange of the trim or decorative member extending around the peripheral edge of the glass surface. The decorative trim or frame members provide a finished appearance for the assembly without further assembly or finishing procedures being necessary in the manufacturing process of the automobile. Moreover, sealing is accomplished both with flanges on the decorative trim or frame as well as through the use of butyl sealant bead at the rear of the assembly. Finally, integrity and strength for the assembly and its fastening to the vehicle body is obtained through strong, rigid attachment of the securing studs using an appropriate metal to glass adhesive or other adhesives depending on the materials used for the fasteners and or window pane.
