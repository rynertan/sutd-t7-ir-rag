# CMOS Current sense amplifiers.

## Abstract
A CMOS current sense amplifier circuit for providing a high speed of operation includes a sense amplifier, a dummy sense amplifier and an operational sense amplifier. A memory array is formed of a plurality of core transistors which are arranged in a plurality of rows of word lines and a plurality of columns of bit lines. A dummy bit line is formed of a plurality of core transistors which are arranged in parallel along the rows of word lines. A first pass transistor and a plurality of Y pass transistors are coupled between the sense amplifier and the memory array. Second and third pass transistors are coupled between the dummy sense amplifier and the dummy bit line. A plurality of N channel MOS transistors are used to clamp all of the bit lines in the array and dummy bit line to a ground potential. The operational sense amplifier is responsive to the sense amplifier, dummy sense amplifier and the clamping transis tors for generating an output signal which has a fast response time when making a low to high transition that is when selecting an unprogrammed memory cell .
