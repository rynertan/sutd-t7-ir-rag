# SINGLE REVOLUTION DISK SECTOR FORMATTER

## Abstract
A track of a disk device is formatted on a single revolution of the disk by using a read only memory ROM to store control codes and a random access memory RAM to store address field and data field bytes. A DMA controller simul taneously addresses ROM and RAM. Control codes are read into a control first in first out memory and data codes are read into a data first in first out memory. The control codes are applied to a decoder whose output signals control cyclic redundancy check and error detection and correction logic as well as the data first in first out memory. The serial output from both the data first in first out memory and the cyclic redundancy check logic are written on disk track.
