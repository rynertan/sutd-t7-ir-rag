## Description
A method for subterraneously, anyhow at least mainly subterraneously, placing a piping system, for instance for temporarily storing heat, in a preferably water saturated ground, as well as a piping system placed subterraneously, anyhow at least mainly subterraneously,by applying said method. The invention relates to a method for subterraneously, anyhow at least mainly subterraneously, placing a piping system, for instance for temporarily storing heat, in a preferably water saturated ground, in particular a particulate ground, such as sand, through which piping system there may be pumped a hot liquid in order to transfer heat to the ground, or a cold liquid in order to absorb heat from the ground, respectively. For subterraneously placing such a piping system up to now there is first excavated a pit having the required depth in which the piping system is placed, said piping system having a rigid construction and being composed in general of horizontal pipes connected to each other. Thereupon the pit is filled again with a mass of ground. This known method has the drawback that it is very time and labour consuming. The object of the invention is to provide a method of the type described above by means of which an important simplification may be achieved when compared with the known method. This method according to the invention is therefore characterized in that a flexible pipe is forced into the ground to form consecutive loops having approximately vertical legs. Because of the use of a flexible piping it becomes possible to place the piping system in the aforesaid form into the ground without requiring the excavation of a pit. Hence it becomes possible in this way to realise an important saving. When placing a flexible piping in the ground it is of advantage to consecutively force the loops into the ground by means of a jig operative to be moved up and down. Before forcing the next loop into the ground in this embodiment the piping may be guided over a roller at either side of the jig as well as over the lower side of the jig, whereupon these rollers are raised over a height approximately corresponding to half the penetration depth of the jig, whereby the piping is drawn off a r eel,this being followed by forcing the jig into the ground while paying out both said rollers at a rate corresponding to about half the rate of penetration of the jig. Furthermore the invention relates to a piping system placed subterraneously, anyhow at least mainly subterraneously, by applying the above described method, According to the invention this piping system is characterized by a flexible piping in the form of consecutive loops having approximately vertical legs. Therein it may be of advantage that the consecutive loops are connected to each other by means of uppermost connecting parts present above the surface and covered by an insulating covering layer. Moreover it is proposed according to the invention that the lower parts of the loops are fastened into the ground with the aid of anchoring means. The invention will be illustrated below with reference to the drawing. Fig. 1 diagrammaticly shows an at least mainly subterraneous piping system according to the invention. Figs. 2 4 diagrammaticly show several stages of forcing a loop of the piping system according to Fig. 1 into the ground. Fig. 5 shows a side elevation of the lower part of a first embodiment of a jig which may be utilised by performing the method according to the invention. Fig. 6 shows a horizontal cross section along the planeVI VI in Fig. 5. Fig. 7 shows a horizontal cross section of an other embodiment of a jig. With reference to the drawing the method according to the invention is elucidated for subterraneously, anyhow at least mainly subterraneously, placing a piping system, for instance for temporarily storing heat, in a preferably water saturated ground, in particular a particulate ground, such as sand. In summer the liquid heated by the heat of the sun may be pumped through this piping system in order to transfer heat to the ground, whereas be in winter cold liquid may pumped through the pipingsystem in order to absorb heat from the ground For an effective operation of such a piping system it is required to accomodate a large length of piping within a relatively small space. According to the invention this requirement is met by placing a flexible piping 1 into the ground to form consecutive loops 2 having approximately vertical legs or piping parts 3. Where the capacity per one approximately vertical piping part 3 is small it will suffice to use a relatively small diameter which may amount to for instance 10 50 mm, at a mutual distance of this piping parts3 of for instance 500 1500 mm. At the lower side of a loop 2 the piping parts 3 are connected to each other by means of the lowermost loop part 4 while the consecutive loops 2 are in communication with each other by means of the uppermost connecting parts 5. In this way there may be obtained a system of approximately vertical piping parts 3 with the aid of a single long flexible piping 1, for instance made of a plastic material without any auxiliary or coupling partsbeing required. According to the invention the loops 3 are forced consecutively into the ground by means of a jig 6 operative to be moved up and down and having a guiding groove 7 for guiding the piping 1. When the jig 6 together with the piping 1 entrained thereby has reached the required depth the jig 6 is pulled upward while leaving behind the loop 2 just forced into the ground.Thereupon the jig 6 carried by a not shown mobile penetration device is displaced laterally until said jig has reached the proper position for forcing a next loop 2 into the ground. The operation of placing a next loop 2 in the ground is carried out as follows At its one end the piping 1 comes out of the ground and is furthermore wound in store on a reel 8 forming part of the penetration device. Before forcing a next loop 2 into the ground the piping 1 is guided at either side of the jig 6 over a steel roller 9 and also over the lower side of the jig 6. The rollers 9 are then raised by means of the penetration device whereby the piping 1 is drawn off the reel 8.When the rollers have reached a a height corresponding approximately to half the penetration depth of the jig 6 the unreeling is stopped and the jig 6 may be forced into the ground which may be performed by ramming or vibrating.During the operation of forcing the jig 6 into the ground both the rollers 9 are paid out at a rate corresponding to about half the rate of penetration so that the reel 8 remains at rest. The liftin iires 19 of the rollers 9 provide for a constant tensioning force in the piping 1. When the jig 6 is forced to penetrate to the required depth at the lower side this jig will carry a staying means 11 along by means of which the lowermost part 4 of the. loop remains fastened in the ground upon raising the jig 6. For protecting the piping 1 against external damages this piping may be brought internaDy under hydraulic pressure with water immediately after placing the reel 8 on the penetration device, which hydraulic pressure may be maintained above a predeterminate minimum value during the entire placing operation of the loops. The uppermost connecting parts 5 are present above the surface of the ground and are covered by an ins ulating covering layer 12. With reference to Fig. 7 there is shown a jig 13 in a modified embodiment, this jig has a crueiform cross sect on by means of which there may be forced simultaneously two pipings 1 wound on different reels 8 into the ground. This jig 13 is provided therefore with guiding grooves 14 for guiding these two pipings 1. Forcing two seperate piping systems into the ground at the same time has the advantage that one of these systems may be utilized solely for storing heat while the other system may be utilized solely for the recovery of the heat. By placing these two seperate piping systems into the ground with the aid of the jig 13 there will be realised an optimum interlacing of the two piping systems within the ground. The piping system or piping systems, respectively, should of course be surrounded by a shielding spaced at some distance therefrom like used in general. The invention is not restricted to the embodiments shown in the drawing which embodiments are subject to several modes of variation within the scope of the invention. claims
