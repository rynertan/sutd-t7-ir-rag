## Description
The present invention relates to heavy duty liquid laundry detergent compositions containing anionic synthetic surfactant, detergency builder, specific proteolytic enzyme and calcium ion. The compositions provide improved cleaning performance, particularly through the wash, of enzyme sensitive stains such as grass, blood, gravy and chocolate pudding. Laundry detergents containing high levels of anionic surfactant and builder, and capable of providing superior cleaning performance, are currently available. Some of these compositions also contain enzymes to enhance removal of enzyme sensitive stains. However, it is believed that such compositions are enzyme limited in that they can denature and expose stains to enzymatic action faster than currently available enzymes can cleave and break up the stains. Enzyme performance can also be limited by a lack of adequate stability in liquid detergents. The stabilization of enzymes is particularly difficult in built, heavy duty liquid detergents containing high levels of anionic surfactant and water. Anionic surfactants, especially alkyl sulfates, tend to denature enzymes and render them inactive. Detergent builders can sequester the calcium ion needed for enzyme activity and or stability. Thus, there is a continuing need for the development of new enzymes that provide improved performance and better stability in liquid detergent compositions, particularly those containing high levels of anionic surfactant and builder. U.S. Patent 4,261,868, Hora et al, issued April 14, 1981, discloses liquid detergents containing enzymes and, as an enzyme stabilizing system, 2 25 of a polyfunctional amino compound selected from diethanolamine, triethanolamine, di isopropanolamine, triisopropanolamine and tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane, and 0.25 15 of a boron compound selected from boric acid, boric oxide, borax, and sodium ortho , meta and pyroborate. The compositions can contain 10 60 surfactant, including anionics, and up to 40 builder. U.S. Patent 4,404,115, Tai, issued September 13, 1983, discloses liquid cleaning compositions, preferably built liquid detergents, containing enzyme, 1 15 alkali metal pentaborate, 0 15 alkali metal sulfite, and 0 15 of a polyol having 2 6 hydroxy groups. The compositions can contain 1 60 surfactant, preferably a mixture of anionic and nonionic in a weight ratio of 6 1 to 1 1, with or without soap. The compositions also preferably contain 5 50 builder. U.S. Patent 4,318,818, Letton et al, issued March 9, 1982, discloses liquid detergents containing enzymes and an enzyme stabilizing system comprising calcium ion and a low molecular weight carboxylic acid or salt, preferably a formate. The compositions preferably contain from about 20 to 50 surfactant, which can be anionic. In a preferred embodiment, the compositions contain about 3 to 15 of a saturated fatty acid. They are othervise substantially free of builders, but can contain minor amounts of sequestrants. European Patent Application 130,756, published January 9, 1985, discloses the proteolytic enzymes herein and methods for their preparation. The enzymes are said to be useful in laundry detergents, both liquid and granular. They can be combined with surfactants including anionics , builders, bleach and or fluorescent whitening agents, but there is no disclosure of specific detergent compositions. Copending European Patent application EP A 199 405 discloses liquid detergent compositions comprising the proteolytic enzymes herein and boric acid. This invention relates to heavy duty liquid laundry detergent compositions comprising, by weight The liquid detergents of the present invention contain, as essential components, anionic synthetic surfactant, detergency builder, specific proteolytic enzyme, calcium ion, and water. The compositions herein provide improved cleaning performance, particularly through the wash, on enzyme sensitive stains such as grass, blood, gravy and chocolate pudding. While not intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the relatively high level of anionic surfactant and builder in the present compositions provides an effective matrix for denaturing stains and exposing sites to enzymatic action. The anionic surfactant is believed to be the primary denaturing agent, whereas the builder controls water hardness that would otherwise complex the anionic surfactant and interfere with its denaturing action. Once the stains are denatured, enzymes bind to the exposed sites and clip chemical bonds before returning to solution to begin the cycle again. After a sufficient number of clips are made, the stained fragments are removed and or solubilized by the surfactants. However, it is believed that the surfactant and builder matrix herein can denature and expose more sites on stains than currently available enzymes can cleave during the washing process. This is particularly true at low washing temperatures e.g., in the range of 15 C to 35 C where enzymes are catalytically slow. The present proteolytic enzymes appear to be superior to other proteases in catalytic efficiency. They thus can take advantage of the stain denaturing power of the compositions herein and provide significant stain removal benefits. In contrast, they provide little or no benefits in detergent compositions containing less anionic surfactant and builder. The compositions of the present invention contain from 7 to 50 , preferably from about 10 to about 40 , and most preferably from about 15 to about 30 , by weight of an anionic synthetic surfactant. Suitable anionic synthetic surfactants are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,285,841, Barrat et al, issued August 25, 1981, and in U.S. Patent 3,929,678, Laughlin et al, issued December 30, 1975. Useful anionic surfactants include the water soluble salts, particularly the alkali metal, ammonium and alkylolammonium e.g., monoethanolammonium or triethanolammonium salts, of organic sulfuric reaction products having in their molecular structure an alkyl group containing from about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms and a sulfonic acid or sulfuric acid ester group. Included in the term alkyl is the alkyl portion of aryl groups. Examples of this group of synthetic surfactants are the alkyl sulfates, especially those obtained by sulfating the higher alcohols C₈ C₁₈ carbon atoms such as those produced by reducing the glycerides of tallow or coconut oil and the alkylbenzene sulfonates in which the alkyl group contains from about 9 to about 15 carbon atoms, in straight chain or branched chain configuration, e.g., those of the type described in U. S. Patents 2,220,099 and 2,477,383. Especially valuable are linear straight chain alkylbenzene sulfonates in which the average number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group is from about 11 to 14. Other anionic surfactants herein are the watersoluble salts of paraffin sulfonates containing from about 8 to about 24 preferably about 12 to 18 carbon atoms alkyl glyceryl ether sulfonates, especially those ethers of C Other useful anionic surfactants include the watersoluble salts of esters of alpha sulfonated fatty acids containing from about 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the fatty acid group and from about 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the ester group water soluble salts of 2 acyloxy alkane 1 sulfonic acids containing from about 2 to 9 carbon atoms in the acyl group and from about 9 to about 23 carbon atoms in the alkane moiety water soluble salts of olefin sulfonates containing from about 12 to 24 carbon atoms and beta alkyloxy alkane sulfonates containing from about 1 to 3 carbon atoms in the alkyl group and from about 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the alkane moiety.

The compositions preferably contain from about 1 to about 5 , more preferably from about 2 to about 4 , by weight of unethoxylated alkyl sulfate. These alkyl sulfates are desired for best detergency performance, in part because they are very denaturing to stains. The compositions herein can optionally contain other synthetic surfactants known in the art, such as the nonionic, cationic, zwitterionic, and ampholytic surfactants described in the above cited Barrat et al and Laughlin et al patents. A preferred cosurfactant, used at a level of from about 1 to about 25 , preferably from about 3 to about 15 , by weight of the composition, is an ethoxylated nonionic surfactant of the formula R¹ OC₂H₄ Preferred cosurfactants for use with the above ethoxylated nonionic surfactants are amides of the formula wherein R¹ is an alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or alkenyl radical containing from about 8 to about 20 carbon atoms, and R² and R³ are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, 2 hydroxyethyl, 2 hydroxypropyl, 3 hydroxypropyl, and said radicals additionally containing up to about 5 ethylene oxide units, provided at least one of R² and R³ contains a hydroxyl group. Preferred amides are the C₈ C₂₀ fatty acid alkylol amides in which each alkylol group contains from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, and additionally can contain up to about 2 ethylene oxide units.

In addition, the weight ratio of anionic synthetic surfactant on an acid basis to the total nonionic surfactant both the ethoxylated nonionic and the amide should be from about 2 1 to about 4 1, preferably from about 2.5 1 to about 3.5 1, to ensure that formation and adsorption of sufficient hardness surfactants at the oil water interface to provide good greasy oily soil removal. Other preferred cosurfactants, used at a level of from about 0.5 to about 3 , preferably from about 0.7 to about 2 , by weight are the quaternary ammonium, amine or amine oxide surfactants described in U.S. Patent 4,507,219, Hughes, issued March 26, 1985. While the compositions herein can contain di long chain quaternary ammonium cationic surfactants e.g., those having 2 chains, each containing an average of from about 16 to about 22 carbon atoms , such as disclosed in British Patent 2,041,968, Murphy, published September 19, 1979, the compositions preferably contain less than about 2 , more preferably less than about 1 , by weight of such surfactants. Most preferably, the compositions are substantially free of such surfactants because they appear to be detrimental to the stability of the proteolytic enzymes herein. The compositions herein contain from 5 to 40 , preferably from about 8 to about 30 , more preferably from about 10 to about 25 , by weight of a detergent builder material. In addition, the composition should contain at least about 20 , preferably from about 25 to about 60 , more preferably from about 30 to about 50 , by weight of the anionic synthetic surfactant and builder. Since the proteolytic enzymes herein appear to provide optimum performance benefits versus other enzymes when the builder to water hardness ratio is close to one, the compositions preferably contain sufficient builder to sequester from about 34 to about 171 mg l, preferably from about 51 to about 137 mg l of hardness. 2 to about 10, preferably from about 3 to about 8, grains per gallon of hardness .

Detergent builders useful herein also include the polycarboxylate, polyphosphonate and polyphosphate builders described in U.S. Patent 4,284,532, Leikhim et al, issued August 18, 1981. Water soluble polycarboxylate builders, particularly citrates, are preferred of this group. Polycarboxylate builders preferably represent from about 1 to about 20 by weight of the composition. Suitable polycarboxylate builders include the various aminopolycarboxylates, cycloalkane polycarboxylates, ether polycarboxylates, alkyl polycarboxylates, epoxy polycarboxylates, tetrahydrofuran polycarboxylates, benzene polycarboxylates, and polyacetal polycarboxylates.

The compositions of the present invention contain from 0.01 to 5 , preferably from about 0.1 to about 2 , by weight of the composition of Protease A as previously defined, or variants thereof in which the Gly at position 166 is replaced with Asn, Ser, Lys, Arg, His, Gln, Ala or Glu the Gly at position 169 is replaced with Ser the Met at position 222 is replaced with Gln, Phe, Cys, His, Asn, Glu, Ala or Thr the Gly at position 166 is replaced with Lys and the Met at position 222 is replaced with Cys or the Gly at position 169 is replaced with Ala and the Met at position 222 is replaced with Ala. These proteases, and methods for their preparation, are described in European Patent Application 130,756, published January 9, 1985. The above enzyme is preferably included in an amount sufficient to provide an activity of from about 0.001 to about 0.1, more preferably from about 0.005 to about 0.07, most preferably from about 0.01 to about 0.04, Anson units per gram of composition. The proteases herein are preferably purified, prior to incorporation in the finished composition, so that they have no detectable odor at a concentration of less than about 0.002 Anson units per gram in distilled water. They preferably have no detectable odor at a concentration of less than about 0.0025, more preferably less than about 0.003, Anson units per gram of distilled water. Proteases herein can be odor purified by any method known in the art. Examples include the solvent precipitation methods described in Solvent initiated precipitation of a crude commercial enzyme solution results in most of the enzymatic activity being precipitated from solution and most of the odor and color impurities remaining in the supernatant liquid. Decantation or centrifugation of the supernatant liquid from the precipitated enzyme results in an enzyme fraction with enriched enzymatic activity gram and improved odor and color. Various solvents or solvent pair combinations can be used to effect the desired precipitation. For example, methanol, ethanol, acetone, other organic solvents, and combinations of organic solvents with and without water can be used. A highly preferred solvent is a combination of water and 30 70 by weight ethanol. This appears to be optimal to prevent enzyme deactivation and maximum recovery of activity. Purfication of protease enzymes also provide benefits in the area of product color stability. The composition also contains from 0.01 to 50, preferably from about 0.1 to about 30, more preferably from about 1 to about 20, millimoles of calcium ion per liter. The level of calcium ion should be selected so that there is always some minimum level available for the enzyme, after allowing for complexation with builders, etc., in the composition. Any water soluble calcium salt can be used as the source of calcium ion, including calcium chloride, calcium formate, and calcium acetate. A small amount of calcium ion, generally from about 0.05 to about 0.4 millimoles per liter, is often also present in the composition due to calcium in the enzyme slurry and formula water. Finally, the compositions herein contain from 10 to 80 , preferably from about 20 to about 60 , more preferably from about 30 to about 50 , by weight of water. The compositions of the present invention can also contain other materials known in the art to enhance enzyme stability.

Boric acid is preferred, although other compounds such as boric oxide, borax and other alkali metal borates e.g., sodium ortho , meta and pyroborate, and sodium pentaborate are suitable. Substituted boric acids e.g., phenylboronic acid, butane boronic acid, and p bromo phenylboronic acid can also be used in place of boric acid.

Examples include propylene glycol especially 1,2 propane diol, which is preferred , ethylene, glycol, glycerol, sorbitol, mannitol, and glucose. The polyol generally represents from about 1 to about 15 , preferably from about 1.5 to about 10 , by weight of the composition. Preferably, the weight ratio of polyol to boric acid is at least 1, more preferably at least about 1.3. The compositions can also contain the water soluble, short chain carboxylates described in U.S. Patent 4,318,818, Letton et al, issued March 9, 1982. The formates are preferred and can be used at levels of from about 0.05 to about 5 , preferably from about 0.2 to about 2 , most preferably from about 0.4 to about 1.5 , by weight of the composition. The compositions herein have an initial pH of from 6.5 to 9.5, preferably from about 7 to about 8.5, most preferably from about 7.2 to about 8.0, at a concentration of 0.2 by weight in distilled water at 20 C. Preferred pH buffers include monoethanolamine and triethanolamine. Monoethanolamine and triethanolamine also further enhance enzyme stability, and preferably are included at levels of from about 0.5 to about 10 , preferably from about 1 to about 4 , by weight of the composition. Other optional components for use in the liquid detergents herein include soil removal agents, antiredeposition agents, suds regulants, hydrotropes, opacifiers, antioxidants, bactericides, dyes, perfumes, and brighteners known in the art. Such optional components generally represent less than about 15 , preferably from about 1 to about 10 , by weight of the composition. Particularly preferred stable isotropic liquid detergents herein are described in U.S. Patent 4,507,219, Hughes, issued March 26, 1985. The following examples illustrate the compositions of the present invention. All parts, percentages and ratios used herein are by weight unless otherwise specified. The following detergent compositions were prepared. in which about 20 by weight of the material has a value of u higher than 5 is dissolved at about 15 level in anhydrous ethanol cooled to about 10 C the insoluble portion 20 is filtered and enough ethanol is distilled to reduce the ethanol level to within the level in the formula When used in Compositions A and B which were tested at a concentration of 2000 parts per million ppm in water , Protease A of the present invention provided significantly better through the wash cleaning of enzyme sensitive stains such as grass, blood, gravy, and or chocolate pudding than did equivalent amounts providing either 0.0012, 0.015 or 0.03 Anson units of activity per gram of composition of the commercially available proteolytic enzymes Alcalase Novo Industries A.S. , Maxtase Gist Brocades N.V. and Maxacal Gist Brocades N.V. . With pretreatment, Protease A provided smaller, generally directional benefits, but with some losses, versus Alcalase on enzyme sensitive stains. Protease A also provided similar benefits relative to Alcalase when the pH of Composition A in the wash solution was adjusted from 7.5 to 7.1, 7.3, 8.0 and 8.5. Protease A provided similar benefits relative to Maxatase when the pH of Composition B in the wash solution was adjusted to 8.0 and 8.5. Significant advantages on grass and chocolate pudding for Protease A were also obtained when the solution pH of Composition B was adjusted to 9.0 to 9.5, although the magnitude of the benefit was reduced at these higher pH s. In Compositions C which was tested at a concentration of 900 ppm in water and D tested at a concentration of 2000 ppm in water , both of which are not within the scope of the invention, Protease A exhibited little or no benefit overall, and some negatives, on enzyme sensitive stains, both through the wash and with pre treatment, when compared with Alcalase. Protease A was also significantly less effective than Maxacal on certain grass, blood, gravy and chocolate pudding stains when used in a granular detergent which is not within the scope of the invention containing 14.5 anionic surfactant, 33.7 sodium tripolyphosphate and 10.5 sodium carbonate builder, and which provided a pH of 10.0 at its usage concentration of 1500 ppm by weight in water at 20 C. Protease A was generally equivalent to Alcalase in the same test, except for significant advantages on some blood stains. When the solution pH of the granular detergent was reduced to 8.0 and 8.5, Protease A was significantly less effective than Maxatase on grass, blood, gravy and chocolate pudding stains. When the C Variants of Protease A in which the Gly at position 166 is replaced with Asn, Ser, Lys, Arg, His, Gln, Ala or Glu the Gly at position 169 is replaced with Ser the Met at position 222 is replaced with Gln, Phe, Cys, His, Asn, Glu, Ala or Thr the Gly at position 166 is replaced with Lys and the Met at position 222 is replaced with Cys or the Gly at position 169 is replaced with Ala and the Met at position 222 is replaced with Ala, all provided better stain removal than Alcalase when tested in Composition A. Preferred Composition E of the present invention contains 0.75 of a slurry of Protease A, providing an activity of 0.015 Anson units per gram of composition.
