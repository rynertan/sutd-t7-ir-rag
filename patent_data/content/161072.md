## Description
MECHANICAL REDUCTION GEAR SYSTEM This invention relates to a mechanical reduction gear system, and more particularly to a mechanical reduction gear system which uses a differential epicyclic gear mechanism. Recently, a differential epicyclic reduction gear mechanism has been extensively used as a control mechanism for a robot and the like. Such a conventional differential epicyclic reduction gear mechanism as typically used in the art is constructed in such a manner as shown in Fig. 1.More particularly, the differential epicyclic reduction gear mechanism shown in each of Figs. l a and l b has an input shaft 10 and an output shaft 12 arranged at the left and right sides thereof, respectively. The input shaft 10 has an eccentric shaft 14 connected thereto, on which an external gear 16 is rotatably mounted. The external gear 16 is meshed or engaged with an internal gear 18 fixedly mounted in a casing 20. Thus, when the input shaft 10 is rotated, the external gear 16 revolves round the input shaft 10 while revolving on its axis.The differential epicyclic reduction gear mechanism of Fig. l a constructed as described above is adapted to allow the rotation of the external gear 16 to drive an internal gear 22 mounted on the output shaft 12, whereas the differential epicyclic reduction gear mechanism shown in Fig. l b is adapted to carry out the transmission of rotation of the external gear 16 to the output shaft 12 by means of a universal joint 24. Such a differential epicyclic reduction gear mechanism constructed as described above has an advantage capable of obtaining a large reduction ratio. For example, in the mechanism shown in Fig. l b , the relationship of tooth number of the external gear 16 and that of the internal gear 18 to the reduction ratio will be indicated by the following equation 1 I i Z2 Z 1 Z2 1 Thus, it will be noted that the smaller the difference in tooth number Z2 Zl is, the larger the reduction gear ratio is. In addition to the above described differential epicyclic reduction gear mechanism, a reduction gear mechanism manufactured and sold under a trademark HarmonicDrive Systems by Harmonic Drive Systems Co., Ltd. is known in the art which is adapted to use, instead of such a rigid epicyclic external gear as described above, a gear which is formed of a thin wall cylindrical member and elastically deformed into an elliptic shape. However, such drive systems have a disadvantage that it is substantially difficult to carry out the transmission of large output, because of the utilization of elastic deformation of the gear. Thus, the rigid gear mechanism shown in Fig. 1 has been recognized anew in view of such a disadvantage of the drive systems combined with the abovenoted advantage thereof, Nevertheless, the rigid gear mechanism or differential epicyclic reduction gear mechanism shown inFig. I has an important problem that it is substantially impossible to construct to reduce the difference in tooth number between the internal gear and the external gear because the mechanism is substantially decreased in contact ratio concurrent intermeshing tooth number and highly subjected to restriction due to the tooth profile interference. Accordingly, it is desirable to develop a mechanical reduction gear system which is capable of substantially increasing a contact ratio in spite of the use of a rigid gear and highly improving operating contact during a loading operation. The present invention has been made in view of the foregoing disadvantages of the prior art and on the basis of the inventor s study on the calculation of limitation of the tooth profile. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a mechanical reduction gear system which is capable of highly increasing a geometric contact ratio. It is another object of the present invention to provide a mechanical reduction gear system which is capable of highly increasing the actual contact ratio during a loading operation, due to the slight deflection of a tooth as small as several microns. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a mechanical reduction gear system comprising an external gear provided to be rotatable about an eccentric shaft and an internal gear engaged with the external gear the external gear having a tooth profile curve which is an addendum tooth profile curve at the outside of a pitch circle and an epicycloid curve inclusive of that generated on the basis of a rolling circle or generating circle having a tooth number fewer by three or less than the pitch circle the external gear having a pressure angle of cos 1 diameter of rolling circle diameter of pitch circle at the pitch circle the internal gear having a tooth profile curve inclusive of that generated on the basis of the tooth profile of the external gear. The invention will be further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figs. 1 a and 1 b each are a schematic view showing a conventional differential epicyclic reduction gear which is capable of exhibiting an advantage due to the engagement of an internal gear with an external gear which has a slightly lower tooth number than the external gear Fig. 2 is a diagrammatic view showing a principle of generating of an epicycloid curve based on the rolling movement of a pitch circle Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic view showing a model of a tooth profile curve of an external gear obtained using the epicycloid curve generated in Fig. 2 Fig. 4 is a diagrammatic view showing a model of a tooth profile of an internal gear which is capable of engaging with the epicycloid tooth profile of the external gear shown in Fig. 3 Fig. 5 is a diagrammatic view showing a phase angle in a range of the engagement between the epicycloid tooth profile shown in Fig. 3 and the tooth profile of internal tooth shown in Fig. 4 Fig. 6 is a diagrammatic view showing a principle of generating of an epitrochoid tooth profile curve in the present invention Fig. 7 is a diagrammatic view showing the comparison between an epitrochoid tooth profile curve generated in the present invention and a cycloid curve Fig. 8 is a diagrammatic view showing a principle of generating of a tooth profile curve of an internal gear using a known tooth profile of an external gear and Fig. 9 is a diagrammatic view showing a principle of shift generating of a tooth profile curve of an internal gear using the same known tooth profile as in Fig. 8. The calculation of limitation of the tooth profile interference between an external gear and an internal gear may be carried out on the basis of either a dedendum tooth profile of which a tooth profile curve is designed at the inside of a pitch point or an addendum tooth profile of which a tooth profile curve is designed at the outside thereof. The design of a tooth profile of a gear based on the dedendum tooth profile causes the tooth profile to be formed into a frusteconical shape to significantly decrease the strength of the gear as compared with that of a belllike shape obtained on the basis of the addendum tooth profile. In view of the foregoing, the present invention has employed an addendum tooth profile. Now, the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 2 shows a principle of generating of an epicycloid curve based on the rolling movement of a pitch circle. In Fig. 2, it is supposed that a pitch circle of an external gear having a radius R1 or pitch circle R1 which is initially contiguous to a pitch circle of an internal gear having a radius R2 or pitch circle R2 at a point PO carries out rolling movement, resulting in the contact point therebetween being changed from the point PO to a point Pc and the initial contact point PO being moved to a position indicated by C in Fig. 2. Locus formed or generated by the point C when the rolling movement of the pitch circle R2 of the internal gear is successively carried out on the assumption described above is called an epicycloid curve. In this instance, when a tooth profile curve of the external gear is at the outside of the epicycloid curve, a tooth profile point on the pitch circle Rz of the internal gear must pass through the tooth portion of the external gear. Such a phenomenon is a socalled interference or tooth profile interference. Thus, it is considered that the epicycloid curve provides an interference limiting line with respect to an addendum tooth profile of the external gear. In the present invention, such an epicycloid curve is named a limiting cycloid. The use of such a limiting cycloid curve as inside and outside tooth profile curves for the external gear allows the addendum tooth profile of the external gear to be obtained. Fig. 3 shows a model of a tooth profile of the external gear obtained using the limiting cycloid. As apparent from the equation 1 , an increase in absolute tooth number causes a reduction ratio to be increasedThus, the tooth profile curve is desirably designed into a conical shape of which the inside and outside are symmetric with each other. In such an addendum curve as shown in Fig.3, a bottom curve at the inside of a tooth profile point E1 on the pitch circle R1 may be formed by means of any suitable curve such as a circle arc, thus, the tooth profile curve is used to constitute only the portion between the pitch circle and an outer addendum circle of a radius RAl An increase in tooth height RAl Rl causes an increase in contact ratio, thus it is desirable to decrease the thickness of the tooth top or the concentric portion A1 A of the addendum circle as much as possible. However, the design of rendering the thickness zero often interferes with the machining. Thus, the thickness is desirably decreased as much as possible so far as the hindrance does not occur. When the tooth profile curve of the external gear is designed or formed using the limiting cycloid, a tooth profile curve of the internal curve contacting with that of the external gear is formed on the basis of only a point on the pitch circle R2. More particularly, as shown in Fig. 4, only a point E2 on the tooth root is required to design the tooth profile curve. The remaining components required for the tooth profile curve are a tooth bottom curve formed in view of a relief and an inside concentric circle. In connection with the engagement between the external gear and the internal gear, the following relationships are considered with reference to Fig. 5. More particularly, the phase angle75A of the intersection CA between the addendum circle and the pitch circle R2 of the internal gear is expressed by the following equation 2 EMI7.1 The contact ratio 6 is calculated on the basis of the pointE2 on any one of both the inside and outside of the pitch circle of the internal gear within a range of ttA according to the following equation 3 EMI7.2 As can be seen from the foregoing, the formation of the tooth profile of the external gear using the limiting cycloid has a disadvantage that the tooth profile of the internal gear has a contact point which is not moved.However, it should be understood that it has an advantage of significantly increasing the contact ratio and substantially decreasing load burden of each tooth. Accordingly, it is desirable to design a tooth profile of an internal gear which is capable of effectively keeping the above noted advantage and eliminating the above described disadvantage. It is justifiable to consider that even when a rigid gear is formed, the tooth is slightly deflected during the actual operation. Accordingly, the assumption of the tooth profile slightly different from the limiting cycloid would allow substantially the same contact ratio as in the limiting cycloid to be obtained during the actual operation.Also, the contact point of the internal gear can be moved depending upon a degree of the difference in tooth profile therebetween. However, since the deflection of the tooth occurs not in an elastic gear such as in Harmonic Drive SystemsTM but in a rigid gear, the above described requirements must be satisfied within a range of delflection between several m and ten odd m. The present invention is to provide a mechanical reduction gear system including a gear having a tooth profile constructed to meet such requirements as described above. It has been found that such a tooth profile can be formed by applying the following conditions to an epitrochoid curve. More particularly, a rolling circle or generating circle is supposed which has a radius RG1 smaller than that Rl of a pitch circle of an external circle. WhenR1 z1M 2 and RGl Z M 2, the design is carried out to meet requirements as indicated by the following equation 4 Zl ZGl 3 4 wherein Zl is an integer and ZGl is not necessarily an integer. The tooth root of the limiting cycloid has a pressure angle of 0, accordingly, a decrease in a pressure angle DC E at a point E on the epitrochoid curve allows the crossed axes angle between both curves at the point E to be reduced. Thus, the design is carried out to meet such requirements as indicated by the following equation 5 EMI8.1 Then, relationships shown in Fig. 6 are considered.More particularly, a distance from the center of a circle having a radius RG2 which rolls in contact with the circle RGl to a point of which locus is to be obtained is indicated by Rc, there are relationships therebetween which are indicated by the following equation 6 EMI9.1 wherein RG2 is determined by preliminary determining the radius of the addendum circle of the limiting cycloid and that of the epitrochoid curve to allow the pressure angles of both addendum circles to be substantially equal to each other.The epitrochoid curve is obtained from the locus of a point C shown in Fig. 6 based on relationships indicated by the following equation 7 E PEO1E fE 7 LPCO C The so designed tooth profile, as shown in Fig. 7, has a curve which crosses the limiting cycloid curve indicated by dotted lines at a slight crossed axes angle at the point E on the tooth root and is gradually away from the limiting cycloid as it goes toward the tooth top. The distance between both curves at the tooth top is very small, thus, it will be noted that it is readily carried out to design the tooth profile to allow the distance to be substantially equal to the deflection of the tooth during the actual loading operation. The tooth profile of the internal gear adapted to be engaged with the external gear having such a tooth profile as described above is obtained in the following matter.First, as the internal gear, a gear is supposed which has an addendum circle of a radius larger than that of the gear designed as described above, and the rolling of the initially schemed pitch circles having radius of R2 and R1 is considered. Under such conditions, the tooth profile of the pitch circle R2 of the internal gear can be obtained by an envelope of the tooth profile of the pitch circle R1 of the external gear which is formed by rolling the circle R1 on the circle R2 in Fig. 8. More particularly, the tooth profile of the internal gear is designed which has an operating pitch circle comprising the pitch circle R1 of the external gear passing through the tooth root of the addendum circle of the external gear and the pitch circle R2 of the internal gear contiguous thereto.In order to carry out such generating, it is desirable that the tooth profile of the pitch circle Rl of the external gear is formed to provide the tooth top with the concentric circle portion Al Al as shown in Fig. 3 and the addendum circle of a slightly larger radius is formed to have a sharp tooth top. The tooth profile curve of the internal gear may be generated to have a tooth profile having an operating pitch circle comprising pitch circles R1 and R2 larger in radius respectively thar. the pitch circles R1 and R2 which are substituted for the circles R1 and R2. In this instance, when the design is carried out in a manner such that first and second internal gears are engaged with one external gear in which an operating pitch circle in the engagement between the first internal gear and the external gear comprises the pitch circles Rl and R2 and an operating pitch circle in the engagement between the second internal gear and the external gear comprises the pitch circles R1 and R2 wherein R1 Rl, R2 RZ, and R2 Rt R2 R1 8 , a so called magic gear mechanism is designed which allows two internal gear different in tooth number from each other to be concurrently engaged with a single small gear. This permits the number of epicyclic external gears for the differential epicyclic gear mechanism to be only one. In this instance, it is required to limit the difference between the radii R1 and R1 within a certain range because the engagement between the pitch circles R2 and R11 is decreased in contact ratio as compared with that between the pitch circles R2 and R1. As described above, the present invention uses the epitrochoid curve with respect to the rolling circle or generating circle slightly smaller in radius than the pitch circle as a tooth profile curve and also uses the external gear of which the pressure angle is substantially minimum on the pitch circle. This allows the gear to be not only substantially increased in contact ratio in spite of being rigid but highly improved in operating contact under loading. Thus, it will be noted that the present invention can effectively provide a mechanical reduction gear system which is suitable for use for obtaining large output and substantial reduction. It will thus be seen that the objects set forth above, among those made apparent from the preceding description, are efficiently attained and, since certain changes may be made in the above construction without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description and shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. It is also to be understood that the following claims are intended to cover all of the generic and specific features of the invention herein described, and all statements of the scope of the invention which, as a matter of language, might be said to fall therebetween.
