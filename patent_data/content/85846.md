# Solar energy collection apparatus.

## Abstract
A solar ray collection apparatus 10 includes a capsule 12 and a solar ray collector 14 housed in the capsule. The solar ray collector is controlled to chase the sun in response to an output of a photodetector 18 which may be located inside or outside the capsule. The capsule comprises a number of interconnected transparent members which are inclined by a specific angle which effects the most efficient collection of the solar energy at any position of the sun. The apparatus is excellent in mechanical strength and resistivity to wind due to unique configuration of each transparent member.
