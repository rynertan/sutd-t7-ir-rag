# Sequential decoder and system for error correction on burst noise channels by sequential decoding.

## Abstract
A sequential decoder 32 for error correction on burst and random noise channels using convolutionally encoded data interacts with a de interleaver 30 which time demultiplexes data from a data channel. The decoder includes a memory 44 for storing a table of likelihood values which are derived from known error statistics about the data channel. The decoder removes 38F an encoded subblock of data from the de interleaver and enters it into a replica 38E of the convolutional encoder which calculates a syndrome bit from a combination of the presently received subblock together with a given number of previous subblocks. For each received bit, an indicator bit is calculated 40 which is a function of the difference between the current path in a convolutional decoding tree and the received sequence. The sequential decoder employs the syndrome bit 38A together with burst indicator bits 40E to calculate 42 a table address in a table 44 of likelihood values and error pattern values.
