## Description
Method of removing liquid from mixing chambers This invention relates to an improved method of discharging liquids from a mixing chamber and is particularly suited to the discharge of molten metals such as those metals and alloys which contain discrete degenerate dendritic primary solid particles and are to be subjected to casting techniques. U.S. Patents Nos. 3,954,455 and 3,936,298 describe metal and metal alloy compositions which contain discrete degenerate dendritic primary solid particles and disclose the advantages of using such materials in casting e.g., lower temperatures, longer mould life, etc. U.S. Patent No. 4,194,552 is of interest with respect to a mixing apparatus for such metal compositions.In carrying out such casting methods it is necessary that the metal be thoroughly mixed while it is held in the mixing chambers so that, when cast, the metal is uniform in composition throughout. Also, it is important that the metal remain uniformly semi solid throughout the mixing chamber and not solidify. The various types of valving systems used heretofore have not been totally satisfactory in that, when the molten metal is discharged and the discharge port plugged from the downstream side, metal tends to splatter during the plugging step. When a seal attached to the rotating mixer is used to stop the flow from the upstream side of the discharge port the discharge port and or plug tends to wear unevenly and leakage occurs. The present invention provides a process for mixing and discharging a liquid from a mixing chamber wherein the liquid is agitated by a vertically disposed agitating member , characterised by providing, in combination, a discharge port centrally disposed at the bottom of said mixing chamber, seating means at the bottom of said agitating member adapted to fit into the upper portion of said port and a stopper plug which seats into the bottom portion of said port, the discharge and termination of discharge of liquid being accomplished by raising said agitating member, removing said stopper plug from the bottom portion of said port whereby liquid flows through said port, and, when termination of liquid flow is desired, lowering said rotating agitating member to seat said seating means in the upper portion of said port while maintaining rotation thereof and then closing the bottom portion of said port by replacing said stopper plug. The invention also provides a mixing chamber for mixing and discharging molten metal wherein said metal is agitated by a vertically disposed mixing member comprising, in combination, a discharge port centrally disposed at the bottom of said mixing chamber, seating means at the bottom of said mixing member adapted to fit into the upper portion of said port and a stopper plug which seats into the bottom portion of said port, whereby the discharge and termination of discharge of molten metal can be accomplished by raising said mixing member, removing said stopper plug from the bottom portion of said port whereby metal flows through said port, and, when termination of metal flow is desired, lowering said rotating mixing member to seat said seating means in the upper portion of said port while maintaining rotation thereof, and then closing the bottom of said port by replacing said stopper plug. The present invention provides a novel discharge port and method of use wherein a liquid suchasmolten metal is uniformly mixed without solidification occurring.The molten metal from the mixing chamber flows smoothly and, when desired, flow may be smoothly stopped without splattering. In addition, the closure means of the flow port does not wear in a manner to adversely affect the system. Reference is now made to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a side elevational view of the stirring device shown in operation in a metal melting furnace with the discharge port in a close position Fig. 2 is a plan view of the system shown inFig. 1 and Fig. 3 is a fragmentary side elevational view of the system with the associated mechanism for discharging the mixed metal. Referring now to Fig. 1 where the agitator system is shown in operation in a mixing chamber, the stirring device, shown generally as 11 is within a ceramic insulated chamber 13 seated in a lower housing retaining member 15 and heated electrically by heating coils 17.Within the thin walled inner container 19 the fluid metal 21 is agitated by the stirrer 11 which is turned by a motor not shown attached to a driving shaft 23 at the upper end of the stirrer. The stirrer 11 comprises generally a rectangular solid which is preferably machined from graphite, although other heat resistant materials may be used, such as suitably coated cast iron or ceramic material. The bottom of the stirrer is terminated by a seating means 25 adapted to seat into the upper portion of a dishcarge port 37, which seating means 25 is a short cylindrical axially centred bearing member. The stirrer assembly 11, 23, 25 is adapted to be raised or lowered to alternately lift the seating means 25 from or lower it into the upper portion of the discharge port 37, for the purpose described below. The agitator shown in the drawing is a preferred type and comprises a rectangular solid constructed about an octagonal core member, but other configurations are useful. In the agitator shown, a series of ports or chambers 27 and 29 are on both sides of the axial centre and the upper and lower limits of the ports are defined by oppositely opposed, angularly directed fin sections 31 and 33 wherein the fins on one side e.g., fins 31 are directed in one direction upwardly and the oppositely opposed fins e.g., fins 33 are directed in the opposite direction downwardly . The stirrer is shown in Fig. 1 in a position rotated 450 to the plane and when rotation is as shown by the arrow surrounding shaft 23, the flow of molten metal will follow the arrows shown in the ports, thus illustrating a lifting effect for the stirrer so that molten metal is mixed vertically as well as horizontally. The number of ports on each side of the axial centre of the rectangular solid is not critical, but it has been found that for use in a melting furnace of about 4 inches 10 cm diameter and about 11.5 inches 29 cm high and having a number of ports on each side, 6 to 8 ports are useful, 8 ports being shown in Fig. 1. At the bottom of the furnace 13 in Fig. 1 a plug 35 is shown seated in the bottom portion of the discharge port 37. The plug has a centrally positior trunion 39 mounted in an elongated slot 41 of a lever arm 45 and in a cam track 43 in a depending flange 47 which to fsh mounted at the bottom of the furnace. A pivot retaining bracket 49 supportssapivat 51about which the lever arm 45 rotates.A slidable counterweight 53 on the lever arm is adjustable by means of a bolt 55. As can be seen by Fig. 2, the lever arm terminates in a bifurcated end 57 to form a yoke mounted on the pivot 51 as shown. Fig. 3 shows the plug 35 in an open position to allow flow of metal from the furnace. This arrangement permits the plug to move vertically rather than in an arc when it is in proximity to the dishcarge port 37 and horizontally only when substantially removed from the discharge port. In this way proper seating of the plug in the discharge port is assured and even if wear on the plug occurs, which wear will be limited because of this arrangement, proper seating is maintained. Under normal conditions, the position of the stirrer 11 is such that the seating means 25 is not seated in the discharge port 37. At these times the mixing chamber seal is provided by the plug 35 seated in the bottom of the discharge port 37. When metal is to be discharged, the plug 35 is removed and metal is allowed to flow out of the discharge port 37. When the desired amount of metal has been discharged, the stirrer assembly 11, 23, 25 is lowered until the seating means 25 is seated in the upper portion of the discharge port 37, thereby terminating metal flow. The plug 35 is then seated in the bottom of the discharge port 37. The sequence is completed by raising the stirrer 11 into its normal position. Several advantages and benefits accrue from the above described system. First of all, the flow of molten metal may be quickly stopped in a controlled manner without splattering. This is due to the time delay effected between the time of seating the stirrer and seating the plug, during which time the metal in the bottom discharge port runs out, thus avoiding fouling and splattering as the plug is positioned in the discharge port. Also, as indicated, there is little wear of the seating means used to seal the discharge port. Furthermore, should wear occur, the stopper plug is easily replaced and the agitator may be constructed with a replaceable seating means which would simply be affixed to and removed from the bottom of the agitator by an appropriate threaded bolt on the sealing means which fits into a threaded hold in the agitator. The system also provides easy access to the discharge port if cleaning is ever necessary. The two separate sealing means also provide an added measure of safety.
