# Temperature stabilized voltage reference circuit.

## Abstract
Each of a pair of PN junction diodes D₁ D₂ is separately dynamically biased by a different clocked current source arrangement C₁, M₂ C₂, M₅ . The resulting diode voltage drops V₁ and V₂ are fed through a weighted difference amplifier A C₃, C₄, C₅, C₆ to produce a voltage reference V
