# Silver recovery apparatus and method.

## Abstract
A silver recovery apparatus for recovering silver from a solution containing silver ions, such as a photo graphic fixer bath, includes an electrolytic recovery cell 20 , a probe electrode 34 located in a liquid conduit 14, 28, 29 connecting a source 12 of the solution to the cell and a magnetic drive pump 32 in the same liquid conduit between the probe electrode and the cell. The probe electrode senses the presence or absence of silver ions at the cathode of the cell and provides a signal that is used to regulate a steady or pulsed plating current. The relative orientation of the probe electrode, magnetic drive pump and recovery cell, as well as the pulsation when applied of the plating current, results in higher plating current in the cell at high silver ion con centrations.
