# Drug delivery device.

## Abstract
A device for the transdermal administration of a drug to a patient comprising a reservoir 11 for the drug to be administered, for example nitroglycerin in an ointment carrier, and means associated with the reservoir 11 for ensuring a supply of the drug to the skin at a pre determined rate. The latter means in the case of a drug in an ointment carrier suitably consists of a plate 13 movable in piston like fashion within the reservoir 11 by application of external pressure thereto, resulting in a constant egress of ointment from the device 10 to the skin through a microporous, drug transfer membrane 15, 16 . The means for applying external pressure is suitably a leaf spring 24 having a face 25 which engages the movable plate 13 . Means 19, 20 are provided for attaching the reservoir 11 to a support member 21 , the support member 21 , in use, is readily detachable from that portion of the body to which the device 10 is applied by means of the strap 22 .
