# Horizontal continuous casting machine.

## Abstract
The molten metal source is connected with the downstream end of the mould by a confining through passage, the discharge axis at the downstream end of the mould being horizontal and being positioned at an elevation below that of the source discharge into the passage such as to enable ferrostatic pressure to achieve a continuous condition of peripheral contact of the casting with the mould at the location of casting exit from the mould. Pref. the through passage is a conduit of refractory material, impervious to liquid steel, and the entire drop in elevation between the source and the mould occurs in the conduit. The mould is pref. straight and horizontal and has a relatively short mould passage. The outside surface of the casting is continuously forced outward into contact with the mould wall, to ensure a brief period of intense cooling giving a solidified shell which retains the cast section shape.

## Description
HORIZONTAL CONTINUOUS CASTING MACHINE The invention relates to a method and apparatus for the continuous casting of metal strands, such as billets, blooms or slabs of steel. In processes for the continuous casting of metal strands, molten metal is continuously poured into the upstream end of an elongate chilled openended mold which. is generally vertical and in which the molten metal makes only brief contact with the mold at the meniscus, being characterised by a shrunken shell around a molten metal core and being therefore in clearance relation with the mold for the greatest fraction of its passage through the mold. This circumstance presents problems of support and guidance of the still largely molten strand as it is caused to travel an arcuate course from its initial vertical to its ultimately straightened condition on the horizontal, to the cut off or other operations.Necessarily, most of the cooling takes place during the travel from vertical to cut off, and for the larger slabs at production rates which the industry demands today, large diameter support rolls are needed throughout the course, to maintain shape until the casting has solidified. Necessarily also, the larger the size of the casting, the greater the vertical height and horizontal distance needed to complete solidification, so that ferrostatic pressure imposes problems of assuring casting quality as well as mechanical problems of casting guidance and support to the point of cut off. Various schemes have been proposed to reduce overall height and attendant ferrostatic pressure, but without much success, except for small billets.The obvious solution would be a horizontal continuouscasting machine which would eliminate the ferrostatic pressure. A horizontal machine could be much less costly, and it would enable substantial reduction in the cost of the melt shop in which it is installed.Another advantage would be that the casting, particularly a slab casting, could be rolled, at great saving of energy, using the heat of the liquid steel. In the horizontal continuous casting of steel, the supply problem is to cause molten metal to fill the mold fully and to press against the upper face of the mold. In prior attempts to solve this problem, the molten metal is caused to fill this upper space, by employing an intermittent casting withdrawal rate a stop and go withdrawal. When casting withdrawal is briefly halted, the momentum of continuously flowing molten steel reacts against the halted casting, causing the molten steel to rise high enough to fill an air gap just below the upper face of the mold.This intermittent technique does not lend itself to the casting of large heavy cross sections, due to the inertia of the casting and the problems of repeated start stop movement moreover, the casting process is not truly continuous. In the present invention a relatively short cooled horizontal mold passage or nozzle is provided, and liquid metal is continuously and constantly forced into filling contact with the mold the constant force is achieved by a head of ferrostatic pressure in the molten metal within the mold, assuring pressure around the entire metal surface of the cooled mold, to thereby form an embryo shell. The supply of liquid metal to the cooled mold is assured by having it travel through a supply passage in a material impervious to liquid metal. The passage is so defined that the metal inlet end is higher than the metal outlet end at entrance to the mold , and this difference in height between the two ends is chosen so that the ferrostatic head is operative in the mold end of the passage. A preferred embodiment of the invention will be illustratively described in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a simplified vertical sectional view of a horizontal continuous casting machine of the invention Figs. 2 and 3 are simplified sectional views taken at 2 2 of Fig. 1, to respectively illustrate slab casting and billet casting and Figs. 4 and 5 are simplified diagrams similar to Fig. 1 to illustrate modifications. The drawing depicts steps and apparatus along a traverse path in the continuously cast production of a solidified metal slab 10 of rectangular section, having a horizontal width dimension W Fig. 2 which may substantially exceed its thickness dimension T the solidified slab is continuously delivered to rolls 11 for horizontal support via end bearing 11 and is horizontally withdrawn by drive rolls 12 12 to a cut off or other operating stage not shown . Casting occurs within a relatively short open ended horizontal mold 13 having a liner 14 which defines a mold passage with an exit end of desired section shape, the liner 14 is suitably of high conductivity metal, such as copper, and is encased by a cooling jacket 15 adapted for continuous application of a flow of cooling water over the outer surface of liner 14. Molten metal 16 is continuously supplied to the upstream end of mold 13, via a tundish 17 and via a broken passage 18 in a conduit member 19 of suitable refractory material, such as graphite, or other material impervious to a flow of liquid steel. The term broken is employed to describe the preferred directional change in the flow path determined by passage 18 passage 18 is inclined below the horizontal, to establish a net vertical head or drop H from its upstream end to its downstream end, the upstream end is curved to receive a continuous horizontal discharge of molten metal 16 at exit from tundish 17, while the downstream end is similarly but oppositely curved, to permit the casting to form and to exit in horizontal alignment with the support and conveyor means 11 12 12 .The length L of conduit member 19 and the steepness of downward slope of passage 18 will be understood to be such as to assure ferrostatically pressurised delivery of molten metal to the full periphery of the mold liner 14. During operation of the machine, molten metal is supplied to tundish 17 in sufficient quantity to enable continuous flow via passage 18 to the mold liner 14, and the solidified slab 10 is withdrawn by rolls 12 12 at a rate commensurate with the rate at which molten metal enters the mold at 18. Also, oil or other lubricant to ease embryo shell passage through mold 13 is supplied via conduit means schematically suggested at 15 exposed to jacketed mold coolant for cooling immediately prior to emergence through peripherally distributed apertures at the upstream end of the mold surface of liner 14. As the embryo casting leaves the mold, it moves through a secondary cooling zone wherein coolant is applied directly to the strand to complete solidification of the casting. As shown, this involves first application of partial vacuum at 20 , to assist in evacuation of burnt lubricating oil as soon as the cast surface emerges from contact with the mold surface the secondary cooling proceeds to completion through application of multiple sprays of cooling water from upper and lower cooling jet elements 21 22. Significantly, in casting passage from initial cooling contact with the mold surface, a there need be no interruption of cooling action, and b the casting is fully exposed to any given point in the path of movement of the casting. To commence operation with the described machine, a dummy bar not shown is engaged by rolls 12 12 12 and extends upstream through the secondary cooling zone and into removable plugging relation within the exit opening of the mold. Molten metal is introduced into the mold into full contact with the end of the dummy bar and into filling peripherally continuous contact with the inner surface of the mold liner 14. As soon as the mold has filled, and with all cooling flows established, drive rolls 12 are started at a rate such that the exit of the mold remains constantly filled and the dummy bar is withdrawn once solid product 10 reaches the drive means 12 12 .The embryo casting develops as a shell 25 conforming to the sectional dimensions of the mold and, as seen from Fig. 1, this shell becomes progressively thicker in its short course within the mold passage, but at least to the point where, at exit from the mold, the shell 25 has solidified enough around a still molten core 26 to retain the cast section shape. In the cooling zone of jet sprays 21 22, solidification proceeds to completion, permitting a solid casting to be handled by means 11 12 12 . It will be seen that in the described process, the outside surface of the casting is always forced outward into contact with the mold wall, thereby assuring a brief period of intense cooling. While the invention has been particularly described in connection with slab production from the single mold 13 and its supply passage 18, it will be understood that other configurations may be similarly cast, as suggested by Fig. 3. Also, by way of example, Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate further refractory passage configurations which embody the ferrostatic head principle discussed, corresponding reference numerals being used where applicable. In Fig. 4, the function of the refractory conduit member 19 is to provide the head or drop H within a short length L so as to avoid as much as possible any cooling within the refractory passage 18 , all for the situation in which upstream supply from the tundish is horizontal, and in which discharge to mold 13 is on the horizontal alignment of the mold liner 14.In Fig. 5, the refractory conduit member 19 further reduces refractory passage length for the requisite ferrostatic head which is operative within the mold, by accepting vertically downward discharge of molten metal from the tundish, provision being made at 30 for flow regulation as may be needed for achievement of correct supply of metal to the mold. From the foregoing description and drawings, several important features of the invention will be noted, particularly when contrasted with the structural nature and design of a conventional vertical continuous slab caster. For example, in one such vertical casting machine which now produces 100 inch slabs at the rate of 1 million tons per year, it is known that a the repair and maintenance cost applicable to the many rolls required to support the slab against bulging from ferrostatic pressure and to guide the casting, as it proceeds on its arcuate course, from vertically down to horizontally out, amounts to about 3.00 per ton of slabs cast, or about 3 million per year b the casting leaves the caster at about 4000F., the product of slow cooling over an extensive arcuate course followed by an extensive horizontal course the slow cooling is dicated by the number and proximity of rolls needed for casting support and for casting shape control, in an environment of high ferrostatic pressure. In contrast, the horizontal caster of the invention does not require the wide face i.e., large diameter rolls which obstruct and preclude cooling access to as much as 85 percent of a vertically cast slab surface, so that therefore the horizontalcaster product is immediately and fully exposed and accessible. And quick cooling is not only tolerable but desirable. Horizontal casting therefore offers a major saving both in number and size of rolls and in roll maintenance, as well as ideal cooling conditions i.e. accessibility for cooling for every grade of steel. The machine and method of the invention is applicable to the production of a full range of size and shape of cast strands, including slabs. In the continuous casting machine a substantial part of the heat of the molten steel is available for rolling.
