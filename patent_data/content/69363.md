# Use of a coating material for optical glass fibers.

## Abstract
A coating material for optical glass fibers is disclosed. The material is comprised of 1,4 polybutadienes having functional groups or modified polybutadienes derived from the 1,4 polybutadienes having introduced therein polymeriz able double bonds different from the double bonds present in the 1,4 polybutadienes.
