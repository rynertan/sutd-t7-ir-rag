# Electrical insulating oil and oil filled electrical appliances.

## Abstract
An improved electrical insultating oil and oil filled elec trical appliances impregrated therewith. The electrical in sulating oil can be produced inexpensively but has excellent electrical characteristics and it comprises a fraction having boiling points in the range of 350 to 450 C that is prepared by disproportionating diarylalkane or a hydrocarbon mixture mainly containing the same at temperatures in the range of 20 to 500 C in the presence of a disproportionation catalyst, said diarylalkane having boiling points in the range of 260 to 320 C.
