## Description
Specification Noise Reduction in Optical Sound Track Systems This invention relates to a method of noise reduction in optical sound track systems. The method is non complementary, i.e. it is carried out on playback only without application of any related technique durinq recordina, and accordingly the invention also relates to a non complementary noise reduction arrangement for handling the playback signal from an optical soundtrack. The recent growth of interest in optical sound track systems, especially since the introduction of stereo systems, has resulted in renewed consideration of noise reduction techniques applied to the format to help overcome much of the inherently poor signal noise performance well known in this type of system. Noise reduction methods are known utilising complementary compression on recording expansion on playback techniques and several systems are already in use, typically systems developed by modification of systems previously developed for use in other mediums, notably magnetic sound recording on tape of both audio and video signals. This invention is primarily concerned with a noise reduction method and arrangement for use on playback of optical soundtracks in cinemas, and as such aims to take into consideration various aspects that are special to such an environment. Moreover, for this reason, the method and arrangement of this invention will not always be suitable for use in other environments. According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of noise reduction in optical soundtrack systems accordina to which the playback signal is first compressed and then expanded, in one case non linearly and in the other case linearly, in a manner such that signal components of which level above a riven threshold are maintained substantially unchanaed whilst sianal components of progressively lower level below said threshold are subject to an overall increasina expansion. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a non complementary noise reduction arrangement for handling the playback signal from an optical soundtrack, comprising a signal compressor followed by a signal expander, one of non linear characteristic and the other of linear characteristic and which maintains substantially unchanged high level signal components above a given threshold and gives increasing expansion of progressively lower level signal components below said threshold. In practice, the signal is non linearly compressed and linearly expanded. The given threshold is preferably selected to be about 30 dE reference 0.775v OdB , whilst, at a level below about 60 dB, low level signal components are effectively subject to linear expansion only. In this way, the system can be applied with use of increasing noise gate characteristics at progressively lower level signal components. Control signal time constants are a necessary feature of the proposed method and arrangement, and these are preferably kept very small a few millisecs. , with the use of control signal time constants during expansion similar to the control signal time constants employed during compression. By means of suitable pass filters, the compression and expansion steps are preferably applied in each of a plurality of frequency band channels into which the playback signal is separated. Further, when applied to a stereo system, similar expansion and compression steps are employed in each of the left hand and right hand channels. As made clear hereinbefore, the method and arrangement of this invention is non complementary playback only and is primarily of interest in playback of an optical soundtrack on a motion picture recording, i.e. playback in a cinema. Such soundtracks are often encoded using known noise reduction techniques which result in an initial playback signal which is effectively compressed, with some loss of dynamic range. Without being matched to any such conventional encoding technique, the method and arrangement of this invention may be utilised to restore some of the dynamic range which has been lost during encoding. The accompanying drawing examplifies the noncomplementary noise reduction arrangement of this invention, and wherein the single figure shows the arrangement in block diagram form. Essentially the illustrated arrangement provides a non linear compression of the playback signal, followed by a linear expansion of the signal immediately afterwards. In addition, a high pass filter and a complementary low pass filter split the signal into two paths, to reduce noise modulation effects, particularly noticeable with low frequency signals. The principle of the described arrangement is to reduce, effectively by maskina l, any inherent noise on the optical soundtrack, together with any noise that may be introduced by amplification of the signal before introduction into the noise reduction arrangement. in detail, the left hand channel signal input at 10 is fed simultaneously to the low pass filter 12 and the high pass filter 14. These two filters are complementary, with a cut off frequency of 1.75 KHz, and a slope of 1P dB oct. The right hand signal is similarly dealt with by filters 26 and 28. Considering the low pass filter path through 12 the high pass path is similar , the signal is first fed to the non linear compressor 16. Any signal above approx. 30 dE ref 0.775v OdB is compressed 2 1, but below this level the compression characteristic is modified so that the amount of compression applied is reduced on low level signals, to the extent that signals below approximately 60 dB may be considered to pass through the compressor circuitry unaffected. The output of the non linear compressor 16 is then fed to a linear expander 18. This complementary process will restore the dynamic range lost in the 2 1 compression of hiah level signals, by expanding these signals by 2 1. At low levels the signal is also expanded 2 1, but as the compression of these signals has been progressively less, as described above, the net effect is variable low level expansion, tending towards noise gate characteristics at extremely low levels. This, in effect, means that, with no signal present, the expander 18 acts as a noise gate, preventing any noise either from the optical soundtrack itself or from pre amplifiers preceding the filter 12, from passina to any subsequent signal processing circuitry following the expander 18. The alternative path via the high pass filter 14 is via non linear compressor 20 and linear expander 22, and similar signal treatment is applied. The left hand signal is output at 24 after recombining the processed signals from the low pass and high pass paths. The right hand signal input at 11, split through low pass filter 26 and high pass filter 28, is also similarly handled in low pass path non linear compressor 30 and linear expander 32 and high pass path non linear compressor 34 and linear expander 36 and after recombining of the sianals from the low pass and high pass paths is output at 25. An additional feature is that the control signal time constants necessary in any such system are kept small, in the order of a few milliseconds, without fear of significant distortion, as lazy distortion intrOduced in a compressor 15, 20, 30 or 34 will be cancelled out by the corresponding expander 18, 22, 32 or 36, provided that the time constants are similar. As the system is non complementary i.e. used on playback only , it is necessary to consider its effects on playback of various types of optically recorded soundtrack. On normal mono soundtracks the net result of using the system will be to increase the effective dynamic range of the recorded soundtrack. Although this will modify the characteristics to some extent, this apparent disadvantage is more than compensated for by the reduction of apparent noise at low levels. On stereo soundtracks the noise problem is inherently increased by the fact that a smaller area is available on each track for the solar cell to see, and as a result lower output levels are normally to be expected.Noise reduction is thus even more important in this application. In addition, many soundtracks recorded in stereo are encoded utilisina one or other of the known noise reduction systems and this invariably means that a compressed signal is presented at 10 and 11. The low level expansion characteristics of the arrangement of this invention tend to restore some of the dynamic range lost in these various encoding processes, even though no aim is made to match any specific characteristic imparted on encoding. The arrangement of the invention is intended, in the first place, for cinema use, and the minor variations in perceived dynamic range as a result of various differently encoded playback signals being presented to it are more than compensated for by the effectiveness of the noise reduction apparent, particularly at a very low signal level in the large auditoria i.e. cinema environment. The same balance of advantage will not, however, be applicable in all other environments for which the noise reduction method and arrangement of this invention may be considered.
