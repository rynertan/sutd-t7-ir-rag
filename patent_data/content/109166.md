# SUPERCONDUCTING TUNNEL JUNCTION DEVICES AND METHOD OF MAKING THEM

## Abstract
A superconducting tunnel junction device comprises superconducting electrodes 11 and 12 separated by a tun nelling barrier 10 of semiconducting material. According to the invention the tunnelling barrier is not uniform throughout its thickness, the middle portion 14 be ing treated to reduce the density of localized states, where as the portions 15 adjacent to the superconducting elec trodes are of untreated semiconductor. This enables a de vice of improved performance to be obtained. In the preferred embodiment described in the specifi cation the superconducting electrodes 11 and 12 are of nio bium and the treated portion 14 of the barrier layer is of amorphous silicon containing hydrogen, the untreated por tions 15 being of pure amorphous silicon. Various other superconducting materials for the electrodes and semicon ductors for the barriers are mentioned, together with other gaseous additives. The devices may be manufactured by deposition steps in vacuum and in inert gas at low pressures.
