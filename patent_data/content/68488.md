# Resist and process for forming resist pattern.

## Abstract
A resist film made of thiocarbonyl fluoride polymers which has excellent sensitivity, resolving power and adhesion property to a substrate and can provide a fine resist pattern. The resist pattern is produced by forming resist film on a substrate, irradiating an ionizing radiation and developing with an organic solvent.
