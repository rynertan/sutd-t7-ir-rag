## Description
The present invention relates to a controller which is used for process control, in particular, to a controller which excels in both of the set point value following characteristics and the external disturbance suppression characteristics. Due to elevation in the process operating needs such as 1 resources saving and energy saving, 2 reduction in personnel and saving power, 3 uniformization and high quality of products, 4 safety, and 5 flexibility, the process control is being demanded to possess an increasingly high controllability, and various means are being devised attempting to attain the limit. In operating a plant, in particular, a continuous process or the like, there will be spread the influence in the chain reacting manner toward the downstream, if the control of the system is disturbed even by a small amount, because of the varying factors such as the changes in the yield in the upstream, various external disturbances, changes in the set point value due to optimization and cascading controll, and so forth. Accordingly, the fundamental principle for control is to improve the controllability of the individual control system to an extremity. Most recently, there are found frequently cases in which there are generated large distrubances such as changes in load during operation, along with the flexibility of plant operation and energy conservation, or there are frequent and large changes in the set point value due to optimization, cascading control, set point value control, and so forth. In such a circumference there occur two problems to implement the above requirement, 1 attaining a desired system response against changes in a set point value, and 2 achieving sufficient feedback to handle disturburances. Prior art controllers however, have, not been configured to cope simultaneously and sufficiently with the two problems. In particular it is desired to accomplish a satisfactory adjustment of integral time at which is likely to occur inconsistency between the characteristics for following the change in the set point value and the characteristics for suppressing the influence due to disturbances acting on the object. US A 3758762 describes a control system combining feedforward and feedback control of a manipulated variable of a process which is arranged to provide a modification of the error signal to which the feedback control responds so as to effect a decoupling of the feedforward and feedback control actions. The error signal is diminished by a signal of magnitude sufficient to minimize or reduce by a predetermined amount the response by the feedback control to action by the feedforward control as reflected in changes in the controlled variable. Provision is also made to avoid unnecessary feedback control in response to set point changes when feedforward action is provided from the set point changes.

In accordance with the present invention, a process controller is prepared to be capable of adjustment of operational parameters with two degrees of freedom which may be much more easily and accurately accomplished to cope with disturbances and changes in set point value. Briefly described, a primary object of the invention is to provide an improved process controller with two degrees of freedom. Especially, the present invention has been conceived to make it possible to sufficiently adjust integral time. The object of the invention is solved by a process controller system comprising first and second controllers both for controlling a response of a process output value against a disturbance applied to a process and for following a process ouput value to a setpoint value change, and said second controller includes a lead lag operation unit having a transfer function and said second controller optimally controls the response of the process output value by adjusting the integrating parameter β which is positive where Kp and Ti are the proportional gain and the integrating time constant of the transfer functions and s is the complex variable. The object of the invention is also solved by a method for adjusting parameters of a process controller system comprising first and second controllers both for controlling a response of a process output value against a disturbance applied to a process and for following a process ouput value to a setpoint value change, comprising To facilitate the understanding of difficulties which prior art encounters, brief reference will be made for the conventional control systems. In Fig. 1 is shown a functional block diagram of a general process controller of the prior art. In the figure, 1 is a deviation operation unit, 3 is a control operation unit, and 5 is a controlled object. The deviation operation unit 1 computes the deviation E SV PV between the control value PV that is fed back from the controlled object 5 and the set point value SV. The control operation unit 3 carries out each of the proportional, integral, and differential operations for the deviation E based on the transfer function C s given by Eq. 1 , determines an adjusted operational output MV to bring the control value PV and the set point value to a coincidence, and outputs it to the controlled object 3. In the controlled object 3, there is carried out a control operation using the adjusted operational output MV as the manipulated value, and when there is generated a disturbance in the control due to impression of an disturbance D, it is detected as a variation in the control value PV. In the above equation, K The response characteristics of the controller is determined, as may be seen from the transfer function shown by Eq. 1 , by the adjusting condition of the control constants K However, if the set point value SV is changed when the control constants are set to the optimum condition of characteristics for suppressing disturbance, the control proceeds too far, the control value PV is unable to follow the change in the set point value, and generates an overshoot. Further, if the control constants are set to a state in which the control value PV follows the change in the set point value optimally, that is, to an optimum condition of characteristics for following set point value, then the suppression characteristics for the disturbance is insufficient so that the responsiveness takes a long time. As in the above, the values of the control constants for the optimum condition of characteristics for suppressing disturbance and those for the optimum condition of characteristics for following set point value differ markedly. This can be understood by examining the adjusting formulae for the control constants due to CHR Chien, Hrones, and Reswick method shown in Fig. 2. Now, for the transfer function of the control operation unit 3, only one kind of control constant for each of K Another prior art process controller is shown in Fig. 3. This is a PID controller with differentiation for PV. Namely, the PI operation is applied at a PI operation means 7 to the deviation E between the set point value SV and the process value PV. From the output of the PI operation means 7 is subtracted, at a subtractor 9, the output of the differential operation on the process value PV at the differential operation means 11. The result is inputted to the proportional gain means 13 to be multiplied by the proportional gain Kp. The resulting signal is impressed on a controlled object 5 as a manipulated signal MV, and a control is carried out to bring the process value PV and the set point value SV to a coincidence. This controller, however, is not able to cope with both disturbances and changes in the set point value as the forth discribed controller. To solve the above problem some configuration with two degrees of freedom has been conceived. Fig. 4 is a block diagram showing a separation type process controller to which two degree of freedom conception is applied. As shown by Fig. 4, in the prior process controller, the deviation El SV PV between the set point value SV and the control value PV is determined in a subtractor 15, and the deviation E1 undergoes an integral operation in the integral operation unit 17. On the other hand, after the set point value SV is multiplied by a coefficient α in a coefficient unit 19, the deviation E2 α SV PV from the control value PV is found in a subtractor 21 proportional operation . Further, the set point value SV is multiplied by a coefficient γ in a coefficient unit 23, the deviation E3 γ SV PV is found by subtracting the control value PV from the above result in a subtractor 25, and the deviation E3 undergoes a differential operation in a differential operation unit 27. Then, the integrated output, the deviation E2, and the differentiated output are additively synthesized in an adder 29, and after it is multiplied by a proportional gain K In the above prior controller, the control constants, namely, the proportional gain K Since, however, in the prior device no compensation is given to the integral time T Namely, the integral time of a control system is determined, as an optimum value for suppressing disturbance, by the magnitude of the dead time L of the controlled object, and is determined, as an optimum value for following the set point value, by the magnitude of the time constant To. Between the dead time L and the integration constant To there is a big difference, and moreover, the larger the time difference between them, the worse is the characteristics for following set point value, when the characteristics for suppressing disturbance is optimized. Therefore, the prior controller is incomplete as a two degrees of freedom PID controller, and it is totally impractical for a plan and others where a large number of PID controller have to be employed. Here, the following model will be adopted as a model G In Fig. 5 are shown the optimum parameters for disturbances at which the controller optimally suppresses the influences due to disturbances K As shown in Fig. 6, for the case of a stepped disturbance, there will be obtained satisfactory response when the optimum parameters for disturbances K In contrast, for a step change in the set point value SV, when the parameters are set to the optimum parameters for set point value. K In what follows process controllers of several types to which the present invention is applied. In the description the term feedforward is used for configuration in which the set point value is operated and the result is fed to the controlled object, bypassing a deviation operation unit. Figure 8 is a functional block diagram for illustrating the structure of a first embodiment of the present invention. In the figure, reference numeral 33 is a compensating operation unit. The set point value SV is introduced to the compensating operation means 33 and a deviation operation unit 35, and the deviation operation unit 35 determines the deviation E between the set point value SV and the control value PV from a controlled object 37, and outputs the result to a control operation unit 39. The control operation unit 39 applies to the deviation E each operation of proportional, integral, and differentiation based on the transfer function C s defined by Eq. 1 to compute the adjusted output MV. Here, it will be assumed that the control constants K However, for the control constants determined by the above adjustment, when the set point value varies the gain becomes large so that control is excessive and the control value PV overshoots the set point value to a large extent. Therefore, the compensation operation unit 33 carries out compensating operation for the set point value SV based on the transfer function H s given by Eq. 2 to compute the compensating quantity a s , in order to correct the control constants K where α, β, and γ are adjusting parameters α adjust the proportional gain K By constructing the controller as above, regardless of whether it is due to variations in the control value PV or to the change in the set point value, for the deviation E from the deviation operation unit 1, computation is carried out by the transfer function given by Eq. 2 to the condition of optimum characteristics for suppressing the disturbances. Of the result of the computation, that part which is based on the deviation due to the change in the set point value, is corrected by Eq. 2 by the compensating quantity a Next, the principle of the present embodiment will be described. The control response for the process shown in Fig. 8 can be represented by the following equation. According to Eq. 5 , in order to manipulate solely the response to the set point value SV without changing the response to the disturbance D, when the set point value SV is changed, one needs only to change the factor C s H s . If we call C s H s the transfer function C s for the optimum characteristics condition for following the set point value, it becomes necessary to arrange for the transfer function C s that it is possible to change independently the values for the control constants K Moreover, in order for the control response to the set point value SV to be settled, it is necessary according to the find value theorem that when the set point value SV is changed stepwise by a fixed value a, with fixed value of the disturbance D, the deviation E As a function that satisfies the above two conditions there is devised a transfer function C s that is given by Eq. 3 . Namely, with respect to the former condition, the adjusting parameters α, β, and γ are involved in the expression in such a way as to change the values of each of the control constants K The transfer function H s is defined by the equation that follows, and the compensating quantity a s is determined for the set point value SV by the compensation operation for each of the proportional, integral, and differential operations based on the set values of the adjusting parameters α, β, and γ. The set point values for the adjusting parameters α, β, and γ of the function are determined as follows by substituting the transfer function C s given by Eq. 3 as shown by Eq. 4 by the use of the control constants K First, α can be determined by As to the parameter β, in relation to the final value theorem that will be described shortly, it can be determined by setting Then, can be determined from Further, γ can be determined as follows. Next, the second condition, namely, that the final value theorem can be satisfied will be explained. In order for the steady deviation E In order to satisfy Eq. 11 the integration term becomes of importance. This is because, for s 0 it follows so that Eq. 11 will not be valid unless the denominator and the numerator of Eq. 11 have equal value. Because of this, the integral time T With such a construction, these are provided idential integration terms in the denominator and the numerator and the integral time in the numerator is adjusted by meas of a first order lag, so that it becomes possible to satisfy the final value theorem. Next, description will be made whether it is possible to change equivalently, by the use of a first order lag, the integral time which used to be difficult to compensate for the past. According to Eqs. 1 and 3 , the integration term for the disturbances is In Fig. 9, the curve a is for the integration term As easily understood, according to the embodiment of the invention an integration operation with relatively long integral time is carried out a certain period after a change of the set point value while thereafter the set point value undergoes an integration operation of short integral time. Next, the operation of the present embodiment, and the method for adjusting each of the control constants and the adjusting parameters. As the adjusting method there are 1 a method, in which the process characteristics time constant T, dead time L, and gain K of the process are determined first and adjustment is made then based on these values by CHR method or other and 2 a method by which the control constants are adjusted to have the step response to the set point value equals the desired response, under the conditions of incompletely known process characteristics. According to method 1 , the control constants K Further, in method 2 which is used in many cases, first the control constants K Moreover, the present embodiment has a construction by which the response can be adjusted by the parameters so that various forms of control can be obtained by varying the value of the parameter α. Thus, in Fig. 10 if one sets α 0, it becomes the I PD control, and if it is set α 1, then it leads to the control only for the characteristics condition for suppressing the disturbances which is similar to the prior controller. Here, the parameter α adjusts the proportional gain K Once the control constants K When the set point value SV is further changed, the control operation unit 39 carries out an operation under the condition of suppressing the disturbance, even for the deviation E that corresponds to the additional change. However, for the portion of change in the set point value SV, the compensating quantity a s which is computed at the compensation operation unit 33 based on the adjusting parameters is subtracted at the operation unit 41 and the result is output to the controlled object 37, giving rise to a compensation that responds optimally also to the set point value SV. As in the above, according to the present invention it is possible to 1 correct virtually the control constants that are adjusted to the condition to suppress the disturbance, to a condition that follows the set point value, so that it is possible to realize both characteristics of disturbance suppression and set point value following. Further, it is possible to 2 to adjust independently the constants for the condition of disturbance suppression and for the condition of set point value following, so that it is possible to select the optimum condition freely for both. Moreover, 3 since the adjusting parameters can be selected after adjusting the control constants to optimize the response of the control value PV to the set point value SV, adjustment on the spot becomes possible to that extent, which leads to the reliability, ease, and fastness of the adjustment. Still further, 4 it has a construction which may be realized by just adding the function of the compensation operation unit 33 to the control operation unit 39 so that it is easily applicable to an existing controller. Finally, 5 since it can compensate for the integral time T In the foregoing, description for an embodiment of the invention, explanation has been made by assuming that the control operation unit 39 carries out each operation of proportional, integral, and differential, and the compensation operation unit 33 carries out also the corresponding operations of proportional, integral, and differential. However, in the present invention, the control operation unit 11 need only to have a construction which carries out at least an integral operation that forms the nuclears for improving the controllability. In other words the spirit of the invention exists in adjustment of the integral times for both the set point value following characteristics and the disturbance suppression characteristics. The compensation operation unit 10, too, need to have a construction, centering around the equivalent integral compensation operation due to a lag element, which is integration alone or a selective combination of integration and proportional or differentiation, depending upon the desired following response to the set point value. For instance, if control of the overshooting alone is what is needed, compensation can be integration alone, and need only to combine it with proportional or differential, or both of proportional and differential, depending upon the degree of improvement of the rising characteristics of the response. Moreover, in the above description of the embodiment use was made of imperfect differentiation which is in frequent use in general as the differential operation for the control operation unit 39. However, needless to say, similar effects can be obtained by the use of the perfect differentiation. In other words, differentiation is meant to include both of the perfect and imperfect differentiations. The present invention can be also applied to process control system in which the set point value is operated, in the pre stage of a deviation operation unit, by a compensation unit which brings no influence to the characteristics for suppressing the disturbances acting on the system. Referring to Figs. 12 through 22, second to sixth embodiments of the present invention will be described. Here, components identical to those in the first embodiment are given identical symbols to omit further explanation. The present embodiment has a compensation operation unit 47 in the pre stage of the deviation operation unit 35 for the set point value SV. In the first embodiment, in order to virtually compensate at the control operation unit 39 for a change in the set point value, the control constants K Namely, the control response of the present embodiment shown in Fig. 12 is represented by the following equation. From Eq. 28 it will be seen that in order to manipulate the response to the set point value SV without changing the response to the disturbance, it is only necessary to change the transfer function H s C s . Fig. 13 shows the transfer functions of second to fourth embodiments of the present invention in which are utilized lead lag operation means as the compensation operation unit 47, In this figure also are shown the overall adjusting modes corresponding to each embodiment. In this connection the Expression for overall adjusting mode with which the description is made will be explained. There are four distinct symbols of which the expression is composed, namely P, I, D and hyphen. Expressions without hyphen corresponds to systems of one degree of freedom type. For example, PI mode expresses a system which can be controlled only in terms of a proportion rate and an integral time for both the set point value following characteristics and the suppression of disturbances acting on the system. With one hyphen adjusting modes having different control modes for the two characteristics can be expressed. Symbols preceding a hyphen refers to the adjusting mode of the both characteristics while symbols following the hyphen expresses only the characteristics for suppressing the disturbance. For example, I P represents a adjusting mode in which an integlation time can be adjusted for both the characteristics while only the disturbance suppression characteristics undergoes a proportion operation. If preceding and following symbols have the same symbol, the expression denotes a two degrees of freedom type system. In case three sets of symbols are connected to each other by two hyphens, the preceding mode represents that for the set point value following characteristics, the last mode represents that for the disturbance suppression characteristics and the middle mode there between represents the both. For example, P I P expresses an adjusting mode in which the proportion rate adjustment is of two degrees of freedom and the integration operation with one degree of freedom is carried out for the both characteristics. When α 1 ..... This leads to H s 1, which is the prior standard PI control. When α 0 ..... There is obtained which is the PID control with filter for set point value. In this case, the PI parameters for PI control are set to the optimum PI parameters for disturbanced suppression, and the time constant for the lead lag operation means 31 is set to the integral time T For changes in the process value PV, there is obtained which represents a PI operation. For changes in the set point vaslue SV , there is obtained Which may be said to represents the so called I P control system. When 0 α 1 ..... In this case, there is obtained which represents from overall viewpoint a P I P control as the following proof indicates. This means that I integration operates simultaneously on the set point value and the process value, and P proportional means that the values for the changes in the set point value and the values for the changes in the process value can be set independently. For changes in the process value PV it gives which represents a PI operation. For changes in the set point value SV it leads to Compared with Eq. 29 , the above expression means an addition of a proportional term of K Fig. 14 A shows the output of the lead lag operation means 31 for different values of α, namely, for α 0, α 1, and 0 α 1, when there is a step like change in the set point value SV. On the other hand, Fig. 14 B shows the changes in the process value PV corresponding to the above cases. When α 1 and δ 1, it leads to H s 1, which corresponds to the standard PID control of the prior art. When α 0 and δ 0, there is obtained which corresponds to the PID control with filter for set point value. In this case, the PID parameters for the PID control are set to the optimum parameters for suppressing disturbance, and the parameters for the lead lag operation means 31 are set also to the same PID parameters. By so arranging, it becomes optimum for the variations in the distrubances and also for the change in the set point value, realizing a two degree of freedom PID control system. For variations in the process value PV , it gives which corresponds to the PID operation. For changes in the set point value SV , it leads to This may be said to correspond to the so called I PD control system. When 0 α 1 and δ 0, there is obtained This corresponds overall to the P I PD control as the following proof indicates. This means that I integration operates commonly to the set point value and the process value, P proportional sets the values for the variations in the set point value independently of the values for the variations in the process value, and D differentiation operates on the process value only. For changes in the process value, it gives rise to which corresponds to the PID operation. For changes in the set point value it leads to Compared with Eq. 31 , these is added a proportional term Kp x for variations in the set point value so that it is possible to improve the characteristics for following the variations in the set point value by varying the value of α, without changing the characteristics for suppressing the disturbances. In other words, it corresponds to the P I PD control system. When α 0 and 0 δ 1, there is obtained It can be show that this corresponds overall to the D I PD control system as the following proof indicates. In other words, for changes in the process value, it gives which corresponds to the PID operation. For the set point value it leads to This corresponds to the ID operation for changes in the set point value. Therefore, summarizing the above results, it corresponds overall to the D I PD control system. When 0 α 1 and 0 δ 1, there is obtained which corresponds overall to the PD I PD control system as the following proof shows. In other words, for changes in the process value it leads to which corresponds to the PID operation. For changes in the set point value, it gives which means that it corresponds to the PID operation for changes in the set point value. Therefore, summarizing above it corresponds to the PD I PD control system. In Fig. 15 is shown fourth embodiment of the present invention. In the embodiment, the lead lag operation means 47 comprises two elements 47 and 47b that are connected in succession. In this case, the transfer function for the lead lag operation means and others are shown in Fig. 2. In the table it is set Here, γ 0.1 in the case of analog adjustors, but γ 0.3 or so is appropriate in the case of digital operation. When α 1 and δ 0, the transfer function for the lead lag element becomes H s 1, which corresponds to the PID control with differentiation for PV of the prior art. Case of setting to α δ 0 When α δ 0, the transfer function for the lead 1 lag element becomes This shows that the filter for the set point value becomes the PID control with differentiation for PV, but it can be shown by the following proof that it corresponds to the I PD control. For changes in the process value PV , it gives which correspondents to the PID operation. For changes in the set point value SV , it leads to which corresponds to the I operation. Therefore, it corresponds overall to the so called I PD control. Case of setting to 0 α 1 and δ 0 When 0 α 1 and δ 0, the transfer function for the lead lag element is given by which corresponds overall to the P I PD control as the following proof shows. For changes in the process value PV , it gives which corresponds to the PID operation. For changes in the set point value SV , it leads to which corresponds to the PI operation. Therefore, overall it corresponds to the P I PD control. Case of setting to α 0 and 0 δ 2 When α 0 and 0 δ 2, the transfer function for the lead lag element is given by which may be found to correspond to the D I PD control as the following proof shows. For changes in the process value PV , it gives which corresponds to the PID operation. For changes in the set point value SV , it leads to which corresponds to the ID operation. Therefore, overall it corresponds to the D I PD control. Case of setting to 0 α 1 and 0 δ 2 When 0 α 1 and 0 δ 1, the transfer function for the lead lag element becomes which corresponds to the PD I PD control by the following proof. For changes in the process value PV , it gives which corresponds to the PID operation. For changes in the set point value SV , it leads to which corresponds to the interference type PID operation. Therefore, it corresponds overall to the PD I PD control. Case of setting to α 1 and δ 1 When α 1 and δ 1, the transfer function for the lead lag element becomes which may be seen to corresponds to the standard PID control as the following proof shows. For changes in the process value PV , it gives which corresponds to the PID operation. For changes in the set point value SV , it leads to which corresponds to the interference type PID operation. Therefore, overall it corresponds to the standard PID control. It is possible to determine transfer functions of the system in Fig. 12 in order to establish a standard PID control system for system transfer function as established in the first embodiment. In the fifth embodiment, description will be made by using a transfer function for the control operation unit 39 which can carry out both operations of proportional and integration as shown by Eq. 39 , for the reason of simplifying the explanation. As in the foregoing embodiment, it is of course true that the operation may be combined with proportional or differential operation in any way one pleased if it includes at least an integral operation. In Eq. 40 , The proportional gain compensation component as shown by Fig. 18 A can compensate a step like change in the set point value SV as a combination of a gain corrresponding to the value of due to lead element and a first order lag function due to lag element. The response to the control value PV is as shown by Fig. 18 B . According to the response given by Fig. 18 B , when α 0, namely, when the change in the set point value SV consists only of a first order function, there is generated no overshoot but there is a lag in rising. When α 1 the control value PV is overshot markedly because the change in the set point value is output to the control operation unit 11 as is or multiplied by α. Under such a circumstance, the response to the control value PV is adjusted to the optimum condition by varying the value of α, so that α can be determined similarly to the case of Eq. 7 . Further, the lead lag operation for the proportional gain compensation can adopt various kinds of construction, for instance, the form of second order transfer function or the like. Further, with respect to the compensational component for the integral time, as explained in conjunction with Fig. 2, it is constructed in the present embodiment, too, so as to change the integral time equivalently by a lag element, in order to satisfy the final value theorem. The adjusting parameter β is determined similarly to that of the first embodiment. Moreover, the compensational component for the derivative time changes the amount of imperfect differentiation corresponding to the change in the set point value SV, by means of the adjusting parameter γ as shown by Fig. 19 A . By this, the response to the control value PV can be improved as to the rising characteristics with almost no influence on the overshoot. Next, the operation of the sixth embodiment will be described. Since the adjusting method for the control constants and the adjusting parameters is similar to that in the foregoing embodiment so that further explanation will be omitted. First, when an disturbance D is impressed on the controlled object 37, the control operation unit 39 carries out each of the proportional, integral, and differential operations based on the control constants K In the second embodiment, similar to the foregoing embodiments, description was made assuming that all of the proportional, integral, and differential operations at both of the control operation unit 39 and the compensation operation unit 47. In the present embodiment, however, if the control operation unit 39 includes at least an integral operation and the compensation operation unit 47 has a construction that can carry out a corresponding compensating operation, for example, a construction shown by Fig. 20 according to which an integral compensation alone can be realized , the rest can be combined selectively depending upon the desired process response. Moreover, when the block construction is to be simplified by achieving identical functions as in the construction shown in Fig. 12, it may be organized as shown by Fig. 15. Still further, when the differential compensation operation alone is to be carried out in the compensation operation unit 47, it needs only to set α and β in Eq. 40 to zero so that it may be constructed as in Fig. 16. The differentiation in it includes both of the perfect and imperfect differentiations as before. Referring to Fig. 23 a sixth emobidment of the invention is shown which is of a separated operation type. As shown in the figure, the controller has special features that differ from the PID controller as shown in Fig. 4 in that it is provided with a first order lag filter 55 in the integral control element. In this embodiment, first the set point value SV is input in parallel to the first coefficient unit 19, the second coefficient unit 23, and the first order lag filter 55. In the first coefficient unit 19, the set point value SV is multiplied by a coefficient α, and the deviation E₁ is computed at a first subtractor 25 between the output α SV and the process value PV detected at a controlled object 37. In the second coefficient unit 23, the set point value SV is multiplied by a coefficient δ, the output δ SV is input to a second subtractor 25, the deviation E₂ between the process value PV is computed, and the deviation E₂ undergoes a differential operation with derivative time T Then, the deviation E₁, the differentiated value of the deviation obtained by the differential operation unit 27, and the integrated value of the deviation E₃ by the integral operation unit 17 are input to an adder 29, and after synthesizing them by addition the result is input to a proportional unit 31 where it is multiplied by a proportional gain K In a construction like in the above, it is arranged to be able to optinize simultaneously both of set point value following and distruvance suppression , by setting the PID parameters K The adjustment of the time constant T In step I , the integral time T The response characteristics of the output ID₃ for a unit step input of the transfer function G Here, for changes in input, the controller is used in general in a region of small value of time, for example, in the region of time which is less than the time T₁ of the figure. Therefore, an increase in the time constant T By setting the coefficients α and δ and the time constant T In what follows there will be described the operating procedure of the operator and the setting method of the parameters for steps I , II , and III , by the use of the astatic process model. Through the setting in each of the steps I , II , and III there will be obtained a response of the controller 1 which is for a step disturbance similar to the case where the standard PID controller is set to the optimum parameters for disturbance K As a result, the response for a unit step in the case when the process 11 is constructed, for example, by an element first order lag dead time is as shown in Fig. 25. Namely, the controllability against variations in disturbance is satisfactory without generating offset even when the time constant T In addition, in this controller there is no need for carrying out for the entirety of the controller a complicated processing which determines control parameters by simultaneously considering the responsiveness of the controller to the disturbances and the variations in the set point value, in order to optimize the response to the disturbances and to the variations in the set point value. That is, the adjustment is extremely easy requiring a simple setting processing as shown by the steps I through III separately and independently for each control loop, and is eventually sufficient by an adjustment on the console by the operator. It should be noted that the optimization of an astatic process explained in the above is the most difficult, but the optimization will further be facilitated if it is a first order lag idle time process e Furthermore, it should be recognized that the various control systems in the past can be selected by setting the coefficients α and δ to 1 or 0 . For example, if the time const is chosen T As in the above, the process controller in accordance with the present embodiment eliminates defects in the prior technilogy, and at the same time, possesses a high degree of controllability and a wide general us ability with the possibility of freely selecting various kinds of prior control systems. Consequently, by the application of the controller 1 scattered within the plant, it becomes possible to optimize each control of the plant for both of disturbances and changes in the set point value. Therefore, it is possible to responds more effectively to the severe requirements in recent years that were mentioned earlier, with an extremely significant contribution to the industry. It is to be noted in the above embodiment that description was made in conjunction with the perfect differentiation T In Fig. 26 is shown a block diagram for the controller concerning a seventh embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the figure, the controller 31 corresponds to the former embodiment from which are omitted the second coefficient unit 23 concerned with differentiation action and the second subtractor 25 and the differential operation unit 27, and may be applied to the case in which the PI control is sufficient for some processes. In this embodiment, too, it is possible to optimize simultaneously both of set point value following and disturbance suppression within the range of the PI control similar to the case of the foregoing embodiments. Moreover, the following can be considered as modifications to the embodiments. Figure 28 is a functional block diagram for illustrating the construction of an seventh embodiment of the device in accordance with the present invention. In the present embodiment, in place of the unit in Fig. 26 the operational expression for the lead lag operation unit 59 is given by the following equation. As may be clear from the figure, there is given an operational adjustment for a change in the process value PV or for a change in the set point value. Here, the proportional gain K In Eq. 45 , for a change in the set point value SV, it is arranged to vary equivalently the integral time alone, by varying the coefficient α and the coefficient β in the lead lag operation unit 59 for the set point value, with the integration term for disturbance fixed at a constant value. If the integration term in Eq. 45 is rearanged, there is obtained the following result. In the above equation 46 , the first term on the right hand side is an integration term with integral time T When β 0 in Eq. 46 , it corresponds to the case where there is no adjustment for the integral time, and there results equivalent integral time T Moreover, when β 0, there results equivalent integral time T Furthermore, when β 0, it is easy to understand that one has equivalent integral time T Then, the coefficients α and β are corrected to bring the response to the optimum condition of characteristics for following the set point value. For instance, when a simulation is carried out by using a transfer function Changes in the coefficient which adjusts the proportional gain K In Fig. 31 there is shown a embodiment of the device in accordance with the present invention, and in Fig. 32 is shown a ninth embodiment of the device in accordance with the present invention, and in Fig. 32 is shown still another embodiment of the device in accordance with the present invention. Here, components that are idential to those for the embodiment shown in Fig. 28 are assigned identical symbols to omit further explanation. The embodiment shown in Fig. 31 is the so called PID controller with differentiation on PV. At a differential operation unit 61, differential operation is applied to the process value PV, and its output signal is additively synthesized in an adder 29 together with the deviations E₁ and E₂. The other components are similar to the embodiment shown in Fig. 28. Further, the embodiment shown in Fig. 32 is the PID controller of the imperfect differential operation type. The set point value SV is multiplied by a coefficient γ at a coefficient unit, and a deviation E₃ γ SV PV is obtained in a subtractor 65 by subtracting the process value PV from the output signal γ SV of the coefficient unit 63. Differential operation is applied to the deviation E₃ in a differential operation unit 61, and its output signal is additively synthesized in the adder 29 together with the deviations E₁ and E₂. Since an integral adjustment due to the lead lag operation unit 5 is carried out also in the embodiments shown in Figs. 31 and 32, it is possible to change the integral time easily by varying the coefficient β. In Fig. 33 is shown a tenth embodiment of the process controller in accordance with the present invention. Here, the components that are identical to those for the embodiment shown in Fig. 33 are given identical symbols to omit further explanation. In this process controller, the set point value is input to both of the coefficient 1 and a lag operation unit 69, as well as it is input to the integral operation unit 17 after the process value PV is subtracted from it in the subtractor 15. The output signal that is computed for the lag in the lag operation unit 69 and the output signal which is integrally operated in the integral operation unit 17 are subtractively processed in a subtractor 71, and the result is output to the adder 29. To be more concrete, the lag operation unit 69 is set to a first order lag represented by β 1 T Therefore, the subtractor 7 and 71, integral operation unit 17, and the lag operation unit 69 for a lead lag operation means so that the manipulated signal MV can be represented as follows. It will be seen from the above that in the process controller of the present embodiment a control similar to that for the case shown by Fig. 28 will be carried out. Namely, for a change in the set point value SV, it is possible to vary equivalently only the integral time for the set point value change, by varying the coefficients α and β, with the integration term for disturbance kept fixed. In addition, in contrast to the case of Fig. 28 in which a lead lag operation unit was required to vary the integral time, the present embodiment has an advantage that it does not need such a complicated operation unit, but can be constructed with a simple first order lag element. It is also possible to constitute improved process control system with two degrees of freedom by provision of adjusting means for element s which operates the process value to be feedbacked. Such a process controller is shown in Fig. 34 as a eleventh embodiment of the invention. The controller is different from the sixth emobidment as illustrated in Fig. 23 in that, in stead of the coefficient units 19 and 23 to operate the set point value SV, there are provided a first coefficient unit 75, a second coefficient unit 77 and a lead element 79 with transfer function 1 2.To.s 1 To.s , in the inputting routes of the process value PV. Namely, first, the process value PV is input in parallel with the first coefficient unit 75, the second coefficient unit 77, and the lead element 79. The process value PV is multiplied by the coefficient α in the first coefficient unit 75, and its output α PV is input to a first subtractor 21 where the deviation E₁ from the set point value SV is computed. In the second coefficient unit 75, the process value PV is multiplied by δ, its output δ PV is input to a second subtractor 25 where the deviation E₂ from the set point value SV is computed, and the deviation E₂ undergoes a differential operation with the derivative time T Then, the deviation E₁, the differentiated value of the deviation E₂ by the differential opertion unit 27, and the integrated value of the deviation E₃ by the integral operation unit 17 are input to an adder 29 where they are synthesized additively. After the result is input to a proportional operation unit 31 where it is multiplied by the proportional gain Kp, it is impressed on the control object 37 as a manipulated signal MV. In this way, the process value PV is controlled to become equal to the set point value SV. set as in the above, the actual proportional gain and the actual derivative time for the process value PV are K III Next, the actual integral time for the process value PV is made, by adjusting the time constant To, to be equal to the actual integral time T The time constant To may be adjusted as taught in the manner explained in conjunction with the sixth embodiment. Namely the integral term operative to disturbances can be rearranged as follows. As understood from the above equation in this embodiment when To increases the integral time decreases, different from the sixth embodiment in which the integral time increases when To increases. In this connection it also can be constituted so as to make enable the adjusting manner similar to that of the seventh emobidment by substituting the following equation in place of that of the above equation. With such a construction for the controller, it becomes possible to optimize the process for both of set point value following and disturbance suppression by setting the PID parameters K In this controller, by the action of the coefficients α and δ, the actual proportional gain and the actual derivative time for the process value PV are α x K In this case the integral term becomes According to this system an adjustment of the integral time is facilitated as shown in Fig. 9. Figure 35 shows a block diagram for a controller concerning a twelfth embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the figure, the controller of the present embodiment has, in the inputting routes of the set point value SV to the first subtractor 21 and the second subtractor 25, a third coefficient unit 81 and a fourth coefficient unit 83, respectively. The present embodiment has a different characteristic in that the signal γ SV obtained by multiplying the set point value SV by the coefficient γ of the third coefficient unit 81 is supplied for proportional operation, and the signal ξ SV obtained by multiplying the set point value SV by the coefficient ξ of the fourth coefficient unit 83 is supplied for differential operation. By the addition of the third and fourth coefficient units 81 and 83, the optimization becomes further simplified. Further, it is possible to select various kinds of prior control systems by assigning 1 or 0 to the coefficients α, δ, γ and ξ. For example, by choosing the time constant T As described in the above, the controller if the present embodiment eliminates the defects that existed in the prior art. and at the same time, is able to choose freely the various kinds of control systems of the prior art so that it possesses a high controllability and a wide usability. Accordingly, by distributing the controller within the plant, it becomes possible to optimize each control of the plant for both of disturbance and set point value. Therefore, it becomes possible to respond the recent severe demands that have been mentioned ealier, with a profound contribution to the industrial world. Further, Fig. 36 shows a block diagram for a thirteenth embodiment of the invention. The controller of the present embodiment is obtainable from the twenty fifth embodiment by replacing the third and fourth coefficient units 81 and 83 respectively by a first and second switches 87 and 85. This corresponds to an arrangement in which the coefficients γ and ξ of the twenty fifth embodiment are replaced by 0 or 1 . Therefore, similar to the first embodiment, it is possible to optimize the controller for both of disturbance and changes in set point value, as well as it is possible to select the prior control systems in the same was as in the twenty fifth embodiment. It should be mentioned that although descriptions of the first through second embodiments was given by the use of the perfect differentiation T Figure 37 shows a block diagram for a controller concerning a fourteenth embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the figure, the controller is obtainable from the first embodiment by eliminating the second coefficient unit 77 and the second subtractor 25 that are related to the differential operation. Moreover, Figs. 38 and 39 show block diagrams for controllers that concern fifteenth and sixteenth embodiments of the present invention. The controllers correspond to the twenty fourth and second embodiments from which elements that are related to the differential operation are eliminated. The embodiments fifteenth through sixteenth are used when PI control alone is sufficient depending upon the process of interest. They possess within the range of the PI control those characteristics that are possessed suspectively by the eleventh through thirteenth embodiments. Furthermore, as a modification to the eleventh through sixteenth embodiments one may consider the following. In the eleventh through sixteenth embodiments, adjustments are carried out for the characteristics for following set point value after giving an optimal control for suppression of disturbance. Contrary to this, seventeenth through twenty fourth embodiments as described hereinbelow are constituted to make it possible to adjust initially the system for suppression of disturbance, and thereafter to give the system an optimal control characteristics for following set point value. Figures 41 and 42 are block diagrams for showing the construction of an seventeenth embodiment of the device of the present invention. For the convenience in description, only the integral operation part which represents the essential part of the present invention is extracted in each figure, and the other parts, namely, the proportional operation part and the differential operation part, will be assumed to be identical to the foregoing embodiments. In Fig. 41, the control valve PV which is fed back is input to a subtractor 21 via a compensatory operation unit 91. In the subtractor 21, deviation E between the set point value SV and the control value PV that has undergone the compensatory operation is found, and the result is supplied to an integral operation unit 93. In the integral operation unit 93, integral operation is applied to the deviation E, the output signal undergoes a proportional operation in a proportional operation unit 31, and the result is supplied to a control object 37 as the manipulated signal MV. In this way, control is carried out to bring the control value PV and the set point value SV to a coincidence. Here, the functions F s and I s for the compensatory operation unit 1 and the integral operation unit 93 of the present invention are set in the following way. First, the response of Fig. 41 is given by the following. In the above equation, F s and I s are set as In Eq. 48 , F s .I s is set to optimize the suppression of the disturbance, and I s in Eq. 47 is set in order to make the characteristics for following the set point value to be variable. Further, as may be clear from Fig. 41, one has to have F s 1 for a steady state where there is no change in the set poínt value SV. Therefore, according to the final value theorem, the transfer function F s has to satisfy Determining the transfer function F s from Eqs. 48 , 49 , and 50 one has It is easy to see that the above transfer function satisfies the final value theorem. The transfer function F s and I s set as in the above, a concrete construction for them is shown in Fig. 42. Namely, the function F s for the compensatory operation unit 1 shows a lead lag operation, and the function I s for the integral operation unit 93 shows a synthesis of an integration and a first order lag. It means that the integral time for a change in the set point value can be varid equivalently with the integral time for a change in the disturbance kept at a fixed value. Explaining the control characteristics of the present embodiment by referring to Fig. 43, the figure shows the response to a change in the set point value SV in the state where the characteristics for suppressing disturbance is optimum for a transfer function of the control object 37. It shows that by setting the control constants K Figure 44 is a block diagram for illustrating the construction of a eighteenth embodiment in accordance with the present invention. In what follows, the components that are identical to those in the first embodiment will be given identical symbols to omit further explanation. The figure shows the second PID controller of I PD control type. The deviation between the set point value SV and the control value PV that has undergone a lead lag operation in the compensatory operation unit 91, goes through an integral operation in the integral operation unit 29. On the other hand, the control value PV undergoes proportional and differential operations in a proportional differential operation unit 93. After the output of the proportional and differential operation is subtracted from the integration output in a subtractor 95, the result is multiplied in a proportional operation unit 31 by the proportional gain Kp, and the result is output to the control object 37 as a manipulated output MV. As may be seen from the figure, the present embodiment optimally controls the suppression of disturbance by carrying out PID control for variations in the disturbance D. Moreover, for changes in the set point value, it is possible to give an optimal control for the characteristics for following set point value by adjusting the coefficient, with the characteristics for suppression of disturbance at fixed values. Figure 45 shows a block diagram for illustrating the construction of a nineteenth embodiment of the device in accordance with the present invention. The present embodiment is arranged to have the coefficients to be multiplied to the control value PV to be fed back to the differential operation unit and to the integral operation unit to be given by 1 α and 1 γ, respectively, and the integral operation pat is the same as in the first embodiment. With such a construction it is possible to achieve the effects that are similar to those for the first embodiments. Figures 46 and 47 show block diagrams that illustrate the construction of a twentieth embodiment of the device in accordance with the present invention. The present embodiment is, similar to the seventeenth embodiment shown in Figs. 41 and 42, the so called two degree of freedom PID controller of the type with filter for process value. Therefore, as explained in connection with the seventeenth embodiment, the control constants K Further, the function I s for the integral operation unit 93 is determined by Eq. 49 , and the function F s for the compensatory operation unit 91 is determined by Eq. 51 . On the other hand, the coefficients α and γ are determined as in the following. If one calls the optimum control constants for suppressing disturbance K from which there follows Here, the coefficients α, β, and γ will attain the optimum values in the ranges of O α 1, O β 1, and O γ 1. Figure 48 shows variations in the PID structure that can be realized by the change in prameters α, β, and γ. As shown in the figure, if all of the coefficients α, β, and γ are varied setting No.6 , then there will be obtained a perfect two degrees of freedom PID controller. In the response characteristics for following set point value Fig. 49 , with setting of the control constants K In Fig. 50 is compared for the same control object the response characteristics for following set point value for the case of α 0.4 in an imperfect two degrees of freedom controller P I PD control of setting No.4 , and the change in set point value for the case of α 0.4 and β 0.15 in a perfect two degrees of freedom controller PI PID control . As may be seen, it is possible to suppress the overshoot without barely changing the rising characteristics, by changing the equivalent integral time through the coefficient β. In Fig. 51 and Fig. 52 are shown block diagrams for illustrating the construction of a twenty first embodiment of the device in accordance with the present invention. The present embodiment is the so called two degrees of freedom PID controller of feedback to set point value type. The difference from the twentieth embodiment consists in the point that the control value PV fed back via the compensatory operation unit 1 is subtracted from the set point value SV which has undergone the integral operation in the integral operation unit 93. The function F s for the compensatory operation unit 1 is set first Equation 52 is for setting the controller to the optimum condition of characteristics for suppressing disturbance while Eq. 53 is for setting it to the optimum condition of characteristics for following set point value. As a condition, it is required that the final value theorem is to be satisfied. From Eqs. 52 and 53 there is obtained It is easy to see that Eq. 55 satisfied the condition given by Eq. 54 . In Fig. 59 A and B is shown a concrete construction of the present embodiment. Moreover, the variations in the PID structure that can be realized by the changes in the coefficients α, β, and γ are as set in Fig. 48. By constructing as above, it is possible to realize response characteristics that are similar to those of Figs. 49 and 50. A twenty second embodiment as shown in Figs. 53 through 57 is of inteference type to which is applied the consideration of the seventeenth through twenty first embodiments. In what follows description of the present invention will be given for an embodiment by referring to the figures. Fig. 53 shows block diagram that illustrates the function of a twenty second embodiment of the present invention. In the figures, components that are identical to those in Fig. 10 will be given identical symbols to omit further explanation. In the figures, 91 is a compensatory operation unit which applies a compensatory operation to the control value PV from a control object 37, and supplies the compensatory control value PV to a deviation operation unit 21. The deviation compensation unit 1 determines the deviation between the compensatory control value PV and the set point value SV, and outputs the result to a control operation unit 105. The control operation unit 105 is provided with a transfer function C s interference type which compensates and corrects the control constants Kp, T Here, the adjusting parameter corrects the proportional gain and δ varies the derivative time. The values for these parameters can be computed as taught heretofore, using the values in the adjustment formulae given by CHR method or the like. For instance, for no overshoot and minimum setting time in the case of adjusting mode of PID, they care to be found to be α 0.63 and δ 1.25. However, for variations in the control value PV, the control constants K In this manner, the control operation unit 105 carries out constantly the operation of adjusting to the optimum condition for following the changes in the set point value. As to the variations in the control value PV due to disturbance, the compensatory operation unit 91 carries out first a compensatory operation which virtually adjusts the control constants Kp , T Next, the principle of the present embodiment will be described. The control response of the process shown in Fig. 53 can be represednted by the following equation. According to Eq. 55 above, when there is impressed by an disturbance D, it is only necessary to correct C s H s in order to manipulate the response to the disturbance. Therefore, the compensatory operation unit 91 is provided in the controller to set C s H s to be the transfer function C s under the optimum condition of characteristics for suppressing disturbance. In this case, it may be thought that by setting C s H s to C s , the response to the set point value SV, too, may be manipulated. However, as shown by Eq. 56 , it becomes equivalent to the construction in which only the response to the set point value is possible to be varied by means of the adjusting parameters α and δ, in the state where the response to disturbance is set to the optimum suppression characteristics for all times. In addition, in order for the process to be set in a steady state it becomes necessary to satisfy the final value theorem. That is, the steady deviation E As in the above, the compensatory operation unit 91 is provided to set for variations in the control value PV, the control constants that are adjusted to the characteristics for following set point value, virtually to the characteristics for suppressing disturbance, and does not affect the control response in the steady state. In Fig. 54 is shown the result of a simulation for the response of control value PV for the case of a transfer function of G Moreover, since the present embodiment has a structure by which the response can be adjusted by means of the adjusting parameters, it is possible to realize various control forms by changing the values of the parameters α and δ, as is indicated by No. 2 in Fig. 55. In this case, the overall adjusting mode shows various control forms of interference type. Namely, for α δ 1, it becomes the ordinary one degree of freedom PID control, for σ δ 0, it carries out I control alone for changes in the set point value while it carries out PID control for variations in the control value, and finally for 0 α 1 and 0 δ 1, it has a construction in which for changes in the set point value, it carries out PD control which can adjust the control constants K If an disturbance is applied to the system in the state for which the control constants K When there is a change in the set point value SV, the control operation unit 105 computes an adjusted output u for the optimum condition of characteristics for following the deviation in the changed amount. In conjunction with the twenty second embodiment described in the foregoing, all of the proportional, integral, and differential operations are carried out in the control operation unit 105, and both of the proportional and differential operations are carried out in the compensatory operation unit 91. However, according to the present invention, the control operation unit 105 needs only to have a construction of carrying out at least one of the operations, and the compensatory operation unit 91, depending upon the response of following the set point value, may have a construction in which each of proportional, integral, and differential operations are introduced singly or in a selective combination. For example, if the control operation unit 105 consists of proportional and integral operations and the compensatory operation unit 91 consists of the operation for compensating the proportional gain, then the construction is as shown by Fig. 56, and the control form realizable for this case is as shown by No. 1 of Fig. 55. Referring to Fig. 57, a twenty third embodiment of the present invention will be described. This embodiment is of a PID PID control type with a simplified configuration. In this embodiment, the control operation unit 109 carries out all of the proportional, differential, and integral operations based on the control constats K In the figure, components that are identical to those in Fig. 1 are given identical symbols. In the control operation unit 109, as shown in Eq. 57 , the control constants K In the operation unit 111, there is added to the adjusted output the compensatory output a s that is obtained in the compensatory operation unit 107 by carrying out all of the proportional, integral, and differential compensatory operations for the control value PV based on Eq. 58 . The result of the addition is output to the control object 3 as the manipulated value u. By this construction, there is supplied to the control object 37 a manipulated value u which is optimum for each of the change in the set point value and the variation in the control value PV. Next, the control response of the present embodiment is as follows. By substituting Eqs. 57 and 58 for C s and H s into Eq. 59 , the denominators for both of the set point value SV and the disturbance D are the general expression for proportional, integral, and differential controls with the control constants K Moreover, since the response compensates the integration term by a first order lag element, it satisfies, as mentioned earlier, the condition for setting the process in the steady state, namely, the final value theorem. Furthermore, the values of the adjusting parameters α, β ,and γ can be determined from the values of the control constants K Namely, can be determined from K Further, as to When the values of the adjusting parameters are determined in the above manner, it is possible to adjust the system to an optimum condition of characteristics for suppressing disturbance by setting the values of the control constants K In this way, when the control value PV is varied due to a disturbance D, in the condition where the control constants are virtually set in an optimum condition of characteristics for both of disturbance suppression and set point value following, the control operation unit 109 determines, for the deviation due to the above variation, an adjusted output based on the control constants for the condition for following the set point value. A compensatory output a s computed in the operation unit 111 based only on the control value PV, independently from the set point value SV, is added to the adjusted output, and the result is output equivalently as a condition for suppressing disturbance. Referring to Fig. 58 a twenty fifth embodiment of the invention is illustrated. In the figures, provided is a process value feedback compensation unit which constitutes a second compensatory operation unit. The set point value feedback compensation unit 113 receives the control value PV and applies to it a compensatory operation which is based on the transfer function F s given by Eq. 63 . For the deviation E due to variations in the control value PV, it supplies to an operation unit 115 a compensating value f which causes the control constants K Since, however, the compensating value f corrects for not only the characteristics for suppressing disturbance but also the characteristics for following set point value, the compensatory adjusted output u improves the characteristics for suppressing diturbance but deteriorates the characteristics for following set point value. The set point value feedforward compensation unit 33 is for recovering the deterioration in the characteristics for following set point value. It applies a compensatory operation to the set point value SV based on a transfer function H s which corresponds to the transfer function F s of the process value feedback compensation unit 113, and outputs the compensating value h obtained to the operation unit 41. The arithmetic unit 14 adds the compensating value h to the compensatory adjusted output u to output the result to the control object 37. Next, there will be given a description about the principle by which it is possible to accomplish optimization for both of the characteristics for following set point value and for suppressing disturbance, by selecting the contents of the two compensatory means in the present embodiment. First, it should be remembered that since the control constants of the control operation unit 39 are adjusted to the optimum condition of characteristics for following set point value, when there is no compensation in both compensating units 33 and 113 the control value PV for changes in the set point value SV is following optimally, as shown by Eq. 62 . Since, however, the response by Eq. 62 has weak suppression characteristics for an disturbance D, there is supplied the set point value feedback compensation unit 113 to correct the control constants equivalently to the characteristics for suppressing disturbance, as seen from Eq. 63 , for improving the disturbance characteristics. However, the transfer function F s of compensating for the suppression of disturbance not only affects the response to the disturbance D but also affects the set point value SV. For this reason, there is provided the set point value feedforward compensation unit 115, to manipulate only the characteristics for following the set point value SV, by fixing the response to the disturbance D. As a result of such a compensation, the control response of the process will become as shown by Eq. 64 . According to Eq. 64 , it will be seen that the suppression characteristics for disturbance D is adjusted by C S F s while the following characteristics for set point value SV is adjusted by C s H s 1 C s F s . Next, the transfer function F s for the process value feedback compensation unit 11 will be determined based on the response given by Eq. 64 . Namely, if the transfer function C s for making the characteristics fro suppressing disturbance D to be an optimum characteristics condition is defined by Eqs. 65 and 66 , the transfer function F s can be computed as given by Eqs. 67 and 68 . In the above equation, K In order for this transfer function to be proper, the control response of the process has to satisfy the final value theorem. Namely, in the case of changing the set point value SV by a fixed amount in step like manner, under the condition of constant disturbance D, the deviation must vanish in the steady state. In order to satisfy the above condition, Eq. 69 has to be fulfilled and in turn Eq. 70 has to be fulfilled. When the expressions for the transfer functions F s and C s are substituted into Eq. 11 , the term in F s corresponding to the integration term 1 T Next, there will be derived the transfer function H s for the set point value feedforward compensation unit 33. This function is for recovering the following characteristics for the set point value SV which is changed by the action of the process value feedback compensation unit 113 as shown by Eq. 63 to recover to a condition as shown by Eq. 62 . When the response to the set point value given by Eq. 64 is corrected as given by Eq. 62 , there is obtained. However, according to Eq. 71 , the response to the set point value overshoots as may be seen from Eq. 64 . Because of this, Eq. 71 is modified to Eq. 72 using a coefficient k 0 k 1 to manipulate only the characteristics for following set point value by varying the value of k. In this manner, the control conctants K Next, an example will be described for computing the values of the adjusting parameters α, β, and γ for setting the values of the transfer function F s for the process value feedback compensation unit and the transfer function H s for the set point value feedforward compensation unit. Namely, comparing the operations in Eqs. 6 and 7 , it is seen for the proportional operation that Further, by setting 1 T Moreover, for the diferential operation part Since K As in the above, when the control constants K As an example of response of the present embodiment, there is shown in Fig. 59 A and B when the transfer function F s for the process value feedback compensation unit 113 consists solely of the proportional compensation, K Further, as shown in Fig. 60, the value of β varies equivalently the integral time of the characteristics for suppressing disturbance. By the use of this parameter it is possible to decrease the maximum value of the variation. The parameter γ is for varying the derivative time by which it becomes possible to suppress the disturbance quickly. Although in the description some embodiments have been made of the perfect differentiaions while others of the imperfect differentiations. It is easily understood that the differentiations of the two type can be mutually interchangeable in any embodiment. Also it should be noted that the present invention is freely applicable to both the position type operation system and the velocity type operation system that is widely being used in direct digital control.
