# Target body position measuring method for charged particle beam fine pattern exposure system.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method for measuring the position of a silicon wafer 16 as a workpiece to be exposed. The method is suitably used in an electron beam exposure system. A wafer 16 has a plurality of chip alignment marks 48 which respectively desig nate a plurality of chip field areas A , included in a dicing line area 8 . When the wafer 16 is contained in a holder 28 and is fixed in the exposure system, edge portions of the wafer 16 are partially scanned with the electron beam to roughly measure the position of the wafer 16 . In accordance with this wafer position data, a wafer surface portion required for detecting only the marks is defined within the dicing line area B . In the mark detection with the electron beam, the electron beam irradiates only the defined wafer surface portion of the wafer surface, thereby providing highly precise measurement of the wafer position and avoiding undesirable irritation of the circuit formation area.
