# Loop network system controlled by a simple clock station.

## Abstract
In a loop network system comprising a plurality of stations connected by a loop shaped transmission path 38 , a particular one 30 of the stations transmits, to the path at a predetermined period, a synchronization signal block serv ing to trigger the other stations 31 36 and to define a highest degree of priority for transmission. A trigger signal block is also transmitted from the particular station to the path so as to define a lower degree of priority each time when a transmission right is seized by the particular station within the predetermined period. Each of the other stations transmits a transmission signal block to the path by seizing a transmission right in consideration of the degree of priority indicated by each of the synchronization and the trigger signal blocks. Each transmission right is given to each station when no signal block is present on the path. A pair of token blocks may be used to guarantee communication of the highest degree of priority and another communication of the lower degree in the predetermined period.
