# Process for the treatment of molten metal.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an apparatus for the treatment of molten metal with a reactive additive. The apparatus comprises 1, 2 a pouring cup 4 hav ing an outlet for introduction of both reactive additive and molten metal into a reaction chamber 7 . The reaction chamber communicates via a channel 12 , preferably of restricted cross sectional area, with an expansion chamber 15 provided with an outlet 16 for the molten metal. The expansion chamber outlet has a smaller cross sectional area than the pouring cup outlet 6 thereby ensuring that the reaction chamber is sufficiently filled to cover any reac tive additive during a pouring treatment. The apparatus permits a series of pourings to be effected without disas sembly of the apparatus to introduce more reactive ad ditive.
