# ALTERNATING CURRENT SERVO MOTOR AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THE SAME.

## Abstract
An AC servo motor employs as a portion of a motor housing the outer peripheral surface 21b of a stator core 21 formed by laminating thin steel sheets 22 . A pair of brackets 25, 26 are respectively attached to the front and rear ends of the stator core 21 . Bearing members 27, 28 are respectively provided on the brackets 25, 26 . In the manufacture, after the brackets 25, 26 have been firmly secured to the stator core 21 , bearing mounting bores 25a, 26a and motor mounting surfaces 25b, 25c are machined so as to be concentric and perpendicular with reference to the axial bore 21a and the outer peripheral surface 21b of the stator core 21 . Thus, a rotor 29 is assembled through the bearing members 27, 28 such as to possess highly accurate concentricity with respect to the stator core 21 . In addition, the perpendicular relation between the motor mounting surfaces 25b, 25c and the output shaft 29a is ensured.
