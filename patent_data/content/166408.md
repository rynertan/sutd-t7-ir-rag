# Gas sensor and method of producing the same.

## Abstract
In a gas sensor consisting of a pair of electrodes 3a, 3b juxtaposed with each other on an electrically insulating sub strate 1 , a sensitive member film 4 interposed electrical ly between one end each of the electrodes 3a, 3b and a protective film 5 covering a part on the sensitive member film 4 and on the other portions of the electrodes 3a, 3b , the present invention provides a gas sensor characterized in that the sensitive member film 4 consists of plasma sprayed titanium oxide layer which has a diffusion reactive layer 8 between it and the substrate 1 , and fine grooves are formed in the surface portion of the sensitive member film 4 . The gas sensor is improved on the response and durability.
