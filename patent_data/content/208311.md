## Description
EP A 4676 describes a direct process for the production of oximes, among others cyclohexanone oxime, wherein a mixture of ketone, ammonia and oxygen is contacted, at a temperature of from 50 to 500 C, with a solid catalyst having a certain surface area. Preferred catalysts are, among many others, ca talysts comprising silica and or zirconia and or an oxide of a transition metal of Group 3 8 of the Periodic Table. DE C 1 245 371 teaches the preparation of cyclohexanone oxime by catalytic reaction, in the liquid phase, of cyclo hexanone with ammonia and hydrogen peroxide at 5 to 40 C, in the presence of a catalyst consisting of phospho tungstic acid or of similar compounds. A drawback of this method is, however, that this type of catalyst is difficult to handle, particularly, during the separation of the product from the catalyst. It has now been found that it is possible to obtain the same high yields by using a completely different catalyst that is easier to handle and simplifies the process in all its steps. Thus, the present invention relates to a catalytic process for preparing cyclohexanone oxime by reacting cyclohexanone with NH₃ and H₂O₂ in the liquid phase at a temperature of from 25 to 100 C and at a pressure equal to or higher than atmos pheric pressure, which process is characterized in that the catalyst substantially consists of a highly crystalline, SiO₂ containing substance having a zeolitic structure and, in particular, of a titanium silicalite, optionally in admix ture with an inert binder. Titanium silicalites are known com pounds which, for example, are described in GB A 2 024 790 and 2 071 071. The reaction temperature preferably is in the range of from 40 to 90 C. Tests carried out at 15 C have provided results that are not completely satisfactory. A pressure above atmospheric pressure is preferred since it promotes the development of the reaction. Other substances of zeolitic nature which catalyse the reaction are, first of all, the various types of silicalite, such as silicalite I see, e.g., US A 4 061 724 , silicalite II, zirconium silicalites and hafnium silicalites. Another class of analogous catalysts are the metal silicalites, e.g., borosilicates boralites , beryllo silicates, chromo silicates, vanadium silicates, zirconium silicates, gallium silicates and ferro silicates which are, in part, described in GB A 2 024 790. A third class of catalysts of analogous type consists of the known aluminium silicates, generally known as zeolites , particularly the zeolites of type Y, the zeolites ZSM5, the zeolites ZSM 11 and the other zeolites ZSM described in EP A 129 239, 141 514 and 143 642, as well as the zeolites MB 28 described in EP A 21 445. Some of these zeolites have already been successfully utilized in the aminoximation of cyclohexanone in the gas phase with NH3 and air. According to another preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention the titanium silicalite mentioned above is replaced, at least in part, by a zirconium silicalite or a boralite. The process according to the present invention can be carried out either continuously or discontinuously, provided that reactors with surfaces that are resistant to hydrogen peroxide are used. When the reaction is carried out in batch , it is advisable that 0.1 to 50 parts by weight preferably from 1 to 20 parts by weight of pure catalyst excluding binder for 100 parts by weight of cyclohexanone be used. If the reaction is performed in a continuous manner, it is preferred to employ a space velocity of from 0.1 to 100 kg h of cyclohexanone C₆H The reaction water, which is formed according to the equation gradually increases the amount of liquid vehicle as the con version to oxime proceeds. During the reaction conside rable amounts of peroxy di cyclohexyl amine of the formula are also formed. Ammonia should always be added before the hydrogen peroxide and in excess NH₃ C₆H At the end of the reaction, the cyclohexanone oxime can be separated by different methods, for example, through extrac tion with suitable solvents such as benzene, toluene and the cyclohexanone as used for the synthesis, whereby a hydropho bic organic phase and an aqueous phase are formed. Cyclo hexanone oxime and unreacted cyclohexanone form the organic layer. The aqueous layer which contains the excess NH₃ as well as traces of cyclohexanone and oxime can be re cycled to the reaction zone ammoximation zone . The following examples illustrate the invention without, however, limiting it. A glass reactor, equipped with a stirrer and a heating jacket, was first blanketed with an inert gas nitrogen . Subse quently, 1.5 g of a catalyst consisting of a finely ground powder of titanium silicalite containing 3.85 by weight of highly crystalline titanium oxide average diameter of the particles 5 µm was charged. 50 ml of a 32 by weight aqueous solution of ammonia were added to the catalyst. The mixture was stirred and 9.5 g of cyclohexanone were charged. The three phase system solid aqueous organic formed was kept homogenous by stirring vigorously. Heating was started by conveying a liquid at 60 C into the jacket. Simulta neously, a 32 by weight aqueous solution of hydrogen per oxide was fed to the reactor by means of a metering pump. After 15 minutes, the temperature in the reactor reached 60 C while the pressure rose to a value of from 80 to 93 KPa 600 to 700 mm Hg above atmospheric pressure. The addition of H₂O₂ was performed within 3.5 hours, during which time the pressure decreased. The temperature was maintained at 60 C and stir ring was continued for a further 1.5 hours, whereafter the test was stopped and the mixture was cooled. 50 ml of toluene were added to the resulting suspension and, after stirring for a few minutes, the aqueous phase and the organic phase were separated from the catalyst by filtration. The liquid phases were separated in a separation funnel and the aqueous phase was extracted with two portions of toluene of 30 ml each. The toluene solutions were com bined and analysed. The analysis revealed a cyclohexanone conversion of 95 and a selectivity to cyclohexanone oxime , of 79.45 the selectivity of hydrogen peroxide to oxime was 68.7 . At the end, about 15 of the starting cyclo hexanone was found to be in the form of peroxy dicyclohexyl amine see formula II above . Example 1 was repeated, varying temperature and pressure. The data and results given in table 1 prove that the selec tivity of the conversion H₂O₂ oxime is very ad versely affected when operating under vacuum. Example 1 was repeated, bringing the pressure gauge to zero and considerably lowering the temperature down to 15 C . The unsatisfactory results shown in table 1 prove that it is disadvantageous to excessively reduce the thermal level of the ammoximation. Example 1 was repeated, replacing titanium silicalite by a zirconite zirconium silicalite . Analogous results were obtained. Example 1 was repeated, replacing titanium silicalite by a boralite boron silicate . Analogous results were obtained.
