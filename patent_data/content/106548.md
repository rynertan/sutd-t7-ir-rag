## Description
COATED OPTICAL FIBERS This invention relates to an improvement in coated optical fibers in which a reinforced coating layer at the outer periphery of an optical fiber strand is composed of a plurality of reinforced fibrous materials and thermoplastic resin immersed in the materials and cured, so calle fiber reinforced plastic FRP . Though the above described coated optical fibers which have been developed for the purpose of mainly improving mechanical properties of the fibers have high mechanical strength against bending and preferable flexibility, the surface of the reinforced coating layer is, in case of reinforcing and coating the optical fiber strands and hence forming the reinforced coating layer when the reinforced coating layer is formed only of the reinforced fibrous material and the thermosetting resin, planed or split, thereby exhibiting improper external appearance. The problems in the external appearance have been heretofore overcome by containing inorganic filler such as calcium carbonate or short glass fiber having particle diameter of higher than 100 um in the reinforced coating layer, thereby performing the stability at the time of forming the coating layer. however, it has become evident according to experiments that the conventional optical fiber having this filler containing reinforced coating layer causes its transmission characteristics to decreased in high temperature range of 100 to 1500C. The cause for the above decrease has been solved as follows The radial linear expansion coefficient of the reinforced coating layer is 5 x 10 5 in the relative relationship between the primary coating of the optical fiber strand and the reinforced coating layer, while that of the primary coating made, for example, of silicone rubber is 1 x lO . Accordingly, the primary coating thermally expands more than the reinforced coating layer in the high temperature range. When the lateral pressure due to the expansion of the primary coating is further applied to the optical fiber, the fillers in the reinforced coating layer causes the lateral pressure to become irregular, with the result that a microbend occurs due to the irregular lateral pressure in the optical fiber, thereby causing the transmission loss of the optical fiber to increase. Particularly in the conventional example, only the problems in the external appearance have been considered in the optical fiber. Accordingly, the relationship between the filler and the transmission characteristics has not been technically solved, and fillers which hac been pulverized to particle diameter larger than 100 ym have existed in the vicinity of the boundary between the reinforced coating layer and the primary coating at random, thereby causing the primary coating to be deformed and accordingly the optical fiber to produced a microbend therein. And, a remedy against these problems have not been made. Accordingly, an object of this invention is to provide coated optical fibers which can eliminate the aforementioned drawbacks and disadvantages of the conventional coated optical fibers and can improve the reinforced coating layer in the optical fibers of this type, thereby performing preferable external appearance and securing preferable transmission characteristics in high temperature range. The above and other related objects and features of the invention will be apparent from a reading of the following description of the disclosure found in the accompanying drawings and the novelty thereof pointed out in the appended claims. Fig. 1 is an enlarged sectional view showing an embodiment of a coated optical fiber according to the present invention Fig. 2 is an enlarged sectional view showing another embodiment of a coated optical fiber according to the present invention and Fig. 3 is a graph indicating the characteristic diagram showing the relationship between the transmission characteristics and the temperature of the coated optical fiber shown in Fig. 1. Reference is now made to the drawings, particularly to Figs. 1 and 2, which show preferred embodiments of coated optical fibers according to the present invention. In Figs.1 and 2, reference numeral 1 designates an optical fiber strand, and reference numeral 2 designates a reinforced coating layer formed on the outer periphery of the strand 1. The strand 1 is composed of an optical fiber 3 of quartz and a coating layer 4 formed on the outer periphery of the optical fiber 3. The optical fiber 3 has a GI type or 2n SI type, and the core clad has, for example, 50 125 Vm. The coating layer 4 is formed of thermosetting resin such as silicone resin or silicone rubber, or photocursble resin such as acrylate compound, and has, for example, 400 pm in outer diameter. This coating layer 4 has a function as a primary coating and may have, in addition, a function as a buffer coating, as well as have two layers on the outer periphery of the optical fiber 3 a primary coating layer and a buffer coating layer. The reinforced coating layer 2 is composed of a composite which has a plurality of long reinforced fibrous materials 5, 5, 5,.., thermosetting resin 6, and fine particles to be described later, which are integrated with the resin 6 as a binder. The fibrous materials 5, 5, 5,.., are mainly glass fiber, or sole unit or composite of carbon fiber, Aramid Trade mark fiber, molten silica fiber, ceramic fiber, and polyamide fiber. The fibrous materials 5, 5, 5,.., are frequently in a roving state or in a yarn state. The thermosetting resin 6 is formed of unsaturated polyester series or epoxy series resin. The fine particles which are mixed in the coating layer 2 have inorganic series or thermoplastic, one or both of which are mixed in the coating layer 2. Fig. 1 shows a coated optical fiber in which fine inorganic particles 7, 7, 7,.., are mixed in the coating layer 2, and Fig. 2 shows a coated optical fiber in which fine thermoplastic particles 8, 8, 8,.., are mixed in the coating layer 2. In the coated optical fiber in Fig. 1, the fine inorganic particles 7, 7, 7,.., mixed in the coating layer 2 are formed of one or more selected from the group which consists of calcium carbonate, talc, hydrated alumina, clay and zeolite. The fine inorganic particles 7, 7, 7,.., have the maximum diameter less than 30 Vm, mean diameter less than 3.0 vm, and the content of the fine inorganic particles 7, 7, 7,.., is less than 25 by weight to the resin 6. Fine thermoplastic particles 8, 8, 8,.., which are mixed in the reinforced coating layer 2 in the coated optical fiber in Fig. 2 are formed of one or more selected from the group which consists of polystyrene, chlorinated polyethylene, ABS resin and cellulose plastic, and have particle diameters of 5 to 50 um and a softening temperature lower than 120if. The content of the fine thermoplastic particles 8, 8, 8,.., in the reinforced coated layer 2 is less than 25 by weight to the resin 6. The characteristics of the coated optical fibers inFigs. 1 and 2 will now be described. Since the fine inorganic particles 7, 7, 7,.., are mixed as fillers in the coating layer 2 of the coated optical fiber in Fig. 1, no irregularities are produced on the surface of the coating layer 2 in case of forming the layer 2, thereby eliminating the problems in the external appearance in the fabrication. Since the particle diameter of the fine particles 7, 7, 7,.., is less than 30 um, irregular lateral pressure which causes a microbend in a high temperature range will not generate, thereby obtaining high transmission characteristics in the optical fiber 3. This advantage of the optical fiber can be clarified by the follqwing embodiment Several types in the particle diameters of the fine inorganic particles 7, 7, 7,.,, in the reinforced coating layer 2 of the coated optical fiber in Fig. 1 were produced, and were evaluated as below.

In view of the temperature characteristics in Fig. 3, in cases of the curve a the maximum diameter of the particles 7 less than 5 ism , the curve b less than 10 um and the curve c less than 30 vm in the range according to the present invention, the transmission loss in the high temperature range less increases, and particularly in case of the curve a, it exhibits stable transmission characteristics without variation in the loss. However, in cases of the curve d the maximum diameter of the particle is 50 Wm and the curve e 80 um out of the range of the invention, the transmission loss increases considerably in high temperature range. On the other hand, in case of the coated optical fiber in Fig. 2, since the fine thermoplastic particles 8, 8, 8,.., are mixed as fillers in the reinforced coating layer 2, the thermoplastic resin 6 increases its apparent viscosity through the softened fine particles 8 at the time of forming the reinforced coating layer 2, and problems in the external appearance such as scratch or split due to a molding die do not occur on the surface of the coating layer 6. Further, since the fine particles 8, 8, 8,.., can be plasticized, irregular lateral pressure which causes a a microbend does not produce at the time of forming at a high temperature, and the reinforced coating layer 6 can be. formed while suppressing the transmission loss of the optical fiber 3. An embodiment of the coated optical fiber in Fig.2 will now be described. The fine thermoplastic particles 8, 8, 8,.., in the reinforced coating layer 2 were formed of polystyrene with mean particle diameter of 30 pm, and the reinforced coating layer 2 was formed with 10 by weight of the fine particles 8, 8, 8,... Tnen, improper external appearance did not almost occur on the surface of the coating layer 2, and the transmission loss increase was only 0 to 0.5 dB km. The temperature of the drawing die used in case of forming the optical fiber was 160 to 195 C, and the plasticizing temperature of the fine particles 8, 8, 8,..was 106 C. The problems in the fabricating steps in the transmission characteristics of the FRP coated optical fiber will be pointed out and the remedy against the problems will be described. When the above described reinforced coating layer is formed on the outer periphery of the optical fiberstrand, a compression distortion is produced in the optical fiber due to the forming contraction of the coating layer and is converted to a bending distortion, thereby causing the optical fiber to frequently produce a microbend. Since the Young s modulus of the plastic coating layer is small in the general nylon plastic coated optical fiber, the coating layer thereafter gradually alleviates, even if the compression distortion is produced, the stress so that the distortion of the optical fiber becomes almost zero, but in case of the reinforced optical fiber, the Youngts modulus of the reinforced coating layer is large so that the stress is hardly alleviated with the result that the distortion remains as it is, thereby causing large transmission loss in the optical fiber. This distortion is called n Z process distortion of the optical iber. When this process distortion is 0.00 , the difference between the length of the coating layer and the length of the optical fiber coincides with the optical path difference of the optical fiber in the general plastic coated optical fiber which has good adherence between the coating layer and the optical fiber strand. When the coated optical fiber is managed in the product, 0.00 8 of optical path difference is regarded as that the process distortion is 0.00 , and the optical fiber is managed as predetermined. The optical path difference of the optical fiber means the difference between the length unit length of the optical fiber core before coating and the length of the core after coating, and is represented by percentage. In case of the FRP coated optical fiber, since the adherence between the reinforced coating layer and the optical fiber strand is insufficient, the difference between the length of the reinforced coating layer and the length of the optical fiber might not coincide with the optical path difference of the optical fiber. Even if the optical path difference of 0.00 is measured in case that the optical fiber is, for example, zigzag in no load state in the reinforced coating layer, the lengths of the reinforced coating layer and the optical fiber are actually different so that the optical fiber tends to be microbend, with the result that there is no reliability in the transmission characteristics based on the optical path difference. According to the present invention, in order to eliminate the increase in the transmission loss caused by the process distortion compression distortion in the FRP coated optical fiber and to enhance the reliability in the product management, a tensile distortion is imparted to the optical fiber strand 1 coated with the reinforced coating layer 2. As described above, in the coated optical fibers according to the present invention in Figs. 1 and 2, the tensile distortion is applied to the optical fiber strand 1, and even if the reinforced coating layer 2 having highYoung s modulus is, accordingly, contracted due to the variations in the temperature and to the external force, a compression distortion does hardly occur in the optical fiber strand 1, with the result that no problem such as microbent takes place, thereby securing the high transmission characteristics of the optical fiber 3. The above described tensile distortion has an adequate range such that the optimum range exists in 0.01 to 0.10 i, because, if the distortion is less than 0.01 , the microbend stopping effect caused by the compression load becomes insufficient, while if the distortion is more than 0.10 , the fatigue degree of the optical fiber 3 becomes large, thereby causing a breakdown accident to be feasible to occur. On the other hand, when the optical fiber strand 1 has the tensile distortion, there is no possibility that the strand 1 is zigzag in the reinforced coating layer 2, with the result that, when the optical path difference in the reinforced optical fiber exhibits 0.00 , the value can be reliable, thereby accurately performing the product management based on it. A method of fabricating the coated optical fiber according to the present invention will now be simply described. The optical fiber strand 1 and the reinforced fibrous materials 5, 5, 5,.., in a roving state are supplied in one direction so that the fibrous materials 5, 5, 5,.., are attached longitudinally to the outer periphery of the optical fiber strand 1. Before that, the fibrous materials 5, 5, 5,.., are once passed through a resin liquid tank in which the fine particles 7, 7, 7,.., or 8, 8, 8,.., are agitated and mixed, thereby impregnating uncured resin 6 to the fibrous materials 5, 5, 5,.., or immersing uncured liquid thermosetting resin 6 to the fibrous materials 5, 5, 5,.., through downstream supplying means in the course of longitudinally attaching the materials 5, 5, 5,.., to the strand 1.Then, the strand 1 and the materials 5, 5, 5, ., thus impregnated are drawn through a mesh plate or a forming die as required, are further drawn through a cylindrical heating and curing furnace, thereby curing the uncured resin 6. The coated optical fiber. thus fabricated is further drawn through a drawing machine, and is then wound by a winch. When the coated optical fiber is fabricated in the above described process, the relationship between the supplying speed V1 of the optical fiber strand 1 before in the heating and curing furnace and the drawing speedV2 after the furnace is set to V1 V2 to provide speed difference. In this manner, a predetermined tensile distortion is imparted to the optical fiber strand 1 in the reinforced coating layer 2. According to the present invention as described above, since the coated optical fiber comprises an optical fiber strand and a reinforced coating layer formed on the outer periphery of the strand and having a plurality of reinforced fibrous materials and thermosetting resin immersed in the materials and cured therein in such a manner that one or both of fine inorganic particles having particle diameter less than 30 pm and fine thermoplastic particles plasticized at a temperature lower than the forming temperature of. the reinforced coating layer and having particle diameter less than 50 urn are mixed in the reinforced coating layer, the formability including the external appearance of the reinforced coating layer can be not only improved, but the increase in the transmission loss in the high temperature range of the FRP coated optical fiber can be suppressed.
