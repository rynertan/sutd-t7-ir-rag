# Production line for bitumen cakes.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a production line for bitumen cakes. The production line or system comprises sequential processing stations, i.e. a station 1 whereat hot bitumen is cast into basins or pans 7 , a station 2 whereat the bitumen is air cooled, a station 3 whereat the solidified bitumen cakes 26 are shaken out, a station 4 whereat the cakes 26 are packaged in a heat shrinkable plastic ma terial, and an optional palletization station 5 . The produc tion line is set up to accommodate a plurality of pans 7 which are carried in groups on a plurality of platforms or supporting frames 8 adapted to be cyclically passed through the casting, station, cooling station where they are piled, and shake out station. The cake shake out station 3 includes an extraction apparatus equipped with a pusher intended for acting on the outside of the pan bottoms to produce resilient deformation of such bottoms, and hence separation of the pan 7 from the bitumen cake contained therein.
