# Flow velocity measuring apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for measuring flow velocity of fluid by detecting a period of vortexes being produced at the downstream side of a vortex generating member disposed in flow of the fluid to be measured, and the apparatus involves a temperature resistance converting element placed at a position being capable of contacting with vortexes and a current supplying means for flowing current through the converting element to keep the same at a desired temperature. The converting element generates a voltage signal, the level of which is changed with a period equal to that of the vortexes when the converting element is periodically cooled by contacting with vortexes so that a current supplied to the converting element controlled in response to the detection signal.
