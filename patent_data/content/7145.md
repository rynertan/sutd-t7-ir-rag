## Description
Nondeformable containerThe invention relates to a nondeformable container1 having a bottom part and side walls with thereinbetween a partition for a number of subjects, in particular to a container for wine bottles. These containers are commonly known and are used for storing and transporting a number of bottles.These containers have the disadvantage that mostly they have to be handled with both hands, the said containers being provided for that aim with handles on the opposite side walls.Another disadvantage of these containers is that they can be stacked bottom down only, whioh, for example when stacking up containers containing wine bottles, is undesirable because in such a case it is better to be able to stack these containers on their sides.It is an aim of the invention to provide a container which is easy to handle as packing means and easy to transport with one hand by the consumer.Another aim of the invention is to provide a container which can be stacked in an upward position and in a position such that the bottles are maintained in a horisontal state.This is attained, according to the invention, by a container having a bottom part and side walls with thereinbetween a partition for a number of objects, in particular bottles, wherein the side walls of the container form a trilateral prism.The trilateral prism form affords stacking of the containers both with the bottoms down and on their sides, since the trilateral prisms fittingly match each other.In order to prevent a wedge effect from occurring on the side as a result of the triangular shape, when stacking up the containers, the container according to the invention has been so designed that two adjoining side walls are provided, at least over a portion of the height of these walls1 with a step directed towards the angle between said side walls. When putting them on their sides, in which case the containers are stacked alternately with their base sides down and with their base sides up, the steps engaging each other, only perpendicular normal forces arise in the area where the steps are located.According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the side walls of the containers provided with a step have an opening in the vicinity of the angle closed in by said walls, and the openings in both side walls thus directly face one another.This results in some sort of handle which facilitates handling by the consumer.According to the invention, it is also possible to vertically stack the containers, the bottom being turned downwards, for instance during transport by trucks. According to the invention this is enabled in accordance with another particular feature of the invention, whereby in the vicinity of one end plane of the trilateral prism, the side walls contain a rabbet and the collar thus formed fits into the interior of the space enclosed by the side walls at the other end plane of the trilateral prism.The invention will be illustrated by an embodiment as shown in the drawings wherein Fig. 1 is a perspective view of two containers turned upside down with respect to one another, the bottom part of the containers being vertically disposed rig. 2 is a perspective view of the stacking of these contanners, the side walls being dispoeed one upon the other and Fi6. 3 is a perspective view of stacking of containers with the bottom down.In the drawings the containers are shown in the form of a trilateral prism having two side walls la and ib and a third side wall 2 as well as a bottom part 3. As frequently occurs in the case of nondeformable containers the bottom is provided with openings 4.As regards the side walls 1a and ib it is to be noted that they are provided with a step 5. The step is directed towards the angle 6 closed in by the side walls 1a and ib. The angle 6 has a small rounding contrary to the angles 7 between the side walls la, ib and the side wall 2 which have a relatively large rounding.The side wall 2 is provided with protruding cams or ribs which1 with respect to the aentre line of the side wall, are divided into two groups, that is, into an odd number on the one side of the centre line and an even number on the other side of the centre line. These groups are referenced Sa and Bb, respectively. The side walls la and ib are, furthermore, provided with an opening 9 in the vicinity of the angle for carrying the container with one hand. The opening 9 in the side wall la then lies directly opposite the opening in the side wall ib. In addition, the interior is provided, in a known manner, with a compartment subdivided by means of partitions in the form of a honey comb 10.Since, in the exemplified embodiment, the container is designed to receive six wine bottles1 the honey comb need not fully extend to the open end of the container, as only the wide portion of the bottle is able to fit in the sections, formed by a honey comb partit ion and the bottle necks are allowed to protrude freely into the clear space present. For this reason also, the handle formed by the openings 9 is located in the vicinity of the bottOm, since a container when filled, is heavier near the bottom than it is near the open end.Moreover, the side walls are provided with a rabbet 11 Fig. 1 close to one end plane of the trilateral prism formed by the side walls 1a1 1b and 2, and the thus resulting collar 12 fits in the interior of the space enclosed by the side walls at the other end plane of the trilateral prism.Stacking the containers on their sides proceeds as follows Initially, the containers A are placed on the floor with their side wall 2 down. Subsequently, in the resultant spaces thereinbetweens the containers B are positioned with their bottom part 2 disposed upwardly. Thus, there 1arises on top of the containers A and 3 a flat surface upon which the containers C may be placed. In order to prevent the containers C from sliding sideways, a rib 8a of a container C fits in between two ribs 8b of a container , as is clearly shown inFig. 2. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the container of the invention also affords a stacking in a different arrangement. In this case the containers B are placed upon the containers A, whose bottoms are facing down, the containers C in turn being placed upon the former. The collar 12 produced by the rabbet 11 then fits in the open end of the containers already disposed thereunder. It is evident that in this manner the containers are prevented from sliding in relation to each other. In addition, the steps 5 of the neighbouring containers again fit into one another, so that a relatively great stability can be obtained in the transverse direction as well.The open end of the container may be provided with a cover plate 13 which is preferably provided with one or several openings 14 enabling a removal of the cover plate from the interior of the tamer. If the cover plate 13 hould be sturdy enough, the openings 14 may also facilitate handling when stacking the oontainera. Such a cover plate may also be used at the bottom end to enhance the physical appearance of the holders when they are stacked with their side walls upon each other. In a very preferred embodiment the edges of the openings 9 do not extend perpendicular to the bottom but te edges extend obliquely with respect to the bottom in such a way that the extension of the centre line of an opening 9 intersects the corner line 6 or the extension thereof at a point upwards from the inner end of the opening 9 towards the upper end of the container. In this way there ia no risk that the bottles as present in a container slide from the container and drop on the ground. ,
