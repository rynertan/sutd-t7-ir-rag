# Apparatus for developing an electrostatic latent image.

## Abstract
An apparatus 36 in which conductive developer material is transported by development means 38, 40 in to contact with a region of a surface 12 having electrostatic latent im ages recorded thereon. An electrical field generating arrange ment 74, 81, 83 provides an electrical field in the development region, and the developer material develops the latent images. In one mode of operation, the electrical field is substantially perpendicular to the surface 12 over one portion of the re gion and substantially non perpendicular thereto over the re maining portion of the region. In another mode of operation, the electrical field is substantially perpendicular to the surface 12 over the entire region.
