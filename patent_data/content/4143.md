## Description
ROUGHAGE SHREDDER This invention relates to shredding devices and in particular to devices for shredding fodder for ruminant animals. The term roughage is commonly used to mean materials of high fibre content such as hay, straw, silage and seed husks. Such materials play an important part in the ruminant diet because of their ability to maintain normal rumen contraction, and to stimulate saliva secretion and volatile fatty acid production. For this ability to be exercised in full it is desirable that the fibre length be of the order of 1 5 cms.In addition to such physiological considerations practical benefits derive from short fibre length material in that the packing and transport of the roughage is improved. It is therefore usual to comminute straw and similar stalky materials to about 3 cm length either when they are to be fed directly to ruminants or before they are ensilaged. A variety of equipment is available for producing short fibre length roughage. For example, there is the conventional chaff cutter in which, say, straw is fed across the path of revolving knife blades which coact with a fixed blade to chop the straw to the desired length.Also there is the hammer mill which is, perhaps, most likely to be used when straw is to be blended with other feedstuffs. Conventional machinery for comminuting feed material does, however, suffer from operating limitations and provides a far from ideal product. Thus the chaff cutter is capable of only low throughput in relation to its size and power requirement about 5kw t hr , moreover, the blades of the chaff cutter have to be carefully set with respect to the fixed blade, which need frequent sharpening and are easily damaged by foreign bodies. Possibly its greatest failing is that as the stalks are only cut across the length, the inner surfaces, which are relatively unlignified compared with the outer surfaces, remain unexposed and so the material is less readily digested than it might be. The hammer mill is even less satisfactory than the chaff cutter. It cannot economically handle material of moisture content higher than about 14 , yet when dry material is being treated there is a heat problem and frequently a dust problem also. The major factor militating against use of the hammer mill is, however, the high power requirement about 7kw t hr arising from the frictional forces generated when the feed material is being crushed and ground between the closely spaced hammer tips and screen. Even in variants of the hammer mill where the screen is dispensed with, such as described in U.S.patents 2066621, 2331597, 2822138 and 3857520, the frictional problem is not alleviated. In fact, it is aggravated, because in such devices the screen is supplanted by a variety of breaker plates which do not have perforations to relieve the frictional forces. It is the primary object of the present invention to avoid the disadvantages of the prior art comminuting devices by providing a machine capable of very effective reduction of a wide range of materials, whether wet or dry, to a form particularly suitable for digestion, and at uniquely low power consumption. The basis of the present invention is recognition of the highly efficient shredding action afforded by rapidly rotating radially aligned blades when used in conjunction with an uneven arcuate surface. The surface being located at such a distance from the circle described by the blade tips that the material being treated is not crushed between the blade tips and surface, but instead it is shred by the blades, projected against the surface and repeatedly directed back into the path of the blades for further shredding during passage through the machine.In some respects it is similar to the invention described in our co pending Australian application No. 38143 78, but the latter is incapable of shredding materials. According to the broadest aspect of this invention there is provided a shredding device having a plurality of radially mounted blades, the rotor being supported within a housing of substantially cylindrical form centered about the axis of the rotor. An outlet duct is provided proceeding tangentially from the casing, and the interior of the casing, or at least a portion extending from the outlet in a direction contrary to the direction of rotation of the rotor, has an uneven surface spaced apart from the rotor blade tips and designed to ensure that material introduced into the casing is repeatedly directed back and forth between the rotor blades and the surface before being discharged from the casing. A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is a section through the machine taken at right angles to the axis of the rotor. Figure 2 is a cross section through the axis of the rotor. In the illustrated embodiment 1 is a generally cylindrical casing within which is supported a rotor 2 journalled into the casing end walls 3. A series of blades 4 are pivotally mounted to shafts 5 secured at their ends 6 to discs 7 fixed to the rotor. An inlet duct 8 permits the introduction of material into the path of the blades. The inlet duct may be provided with a sliding gate or similar mechanism for regulating the inflow of material. Provision of restriction means on the outlet may also prove useful, since the product tends to become finer if the passage of air through the machine is restricted. A tangentially disposed outlet duct 9 directs comminuted material to associated equipment such as conveyor belts, collecting bins, separators and the like.On the interior surface of the casing through an arc extending roughly from the inlet duct to the outlet duct there are formed a series of ripples 10. In operation the rotor is coupled to a motor and rotated in the direction shown by the arrows. Material to be processed is fed into the inlet duct 8 to be struck by the rotating blades and flung towards the rippled interior surface of the casing 1. The mechanisms whereby material is directed back to the blades will depend on factors such as the velocity and density of the material.The heavier material will strike the surfaces of the ripples which face the direction of rotation of the rotor and rebound upon impact, whereas lighter material is caught up in the turbulent air flow generated by the ripples and returned back into the path of the blades without contacting the ripples. The effect is that the material contacts the blades many times before being discharged through outlet 9. Although not illustrated, an alternative to the inlet duct 8 may take the form of an aperture in an end wall of the casing through which material can be introduced in a direction generally parallel to the axis of the rotor. Such an arrangement may be found to be more convenient when processing long, stiff feed material, in which case as a further refinement it may be advantageous if rotor blades such as 11 closest to the inlet aperture are of relatively heavier construction than the other blades and also cooperate with a fixed edge in the casing end wall adjacent to the inlet aperture. In embodiments where feed material is introduced via an end wall aperture it may be found convenient to have a vertically disposed rotor, instead of a horizontal rotor which would be usual where material is introduced via a duct in the cylindrical portion of the casing. As the primary purpose of the rotor blades is to shred material they should have at least one leading edge capable of effecting a shearing action. The blades may, therefore, take the form of knives. However, as mentioned above when referring to chaff cutters, knife blades are likely to become blunted after relatively little use and are also susceptible to damage by contact with foreign bodies. We have found that knife edges are not essential, and less sharp edges such as those of blades of rectangular cross section, permit relatively maintenance free shredding of a wide range of feed materials, and in addition the flat leading surface presented by rectangular crosssection blades plays a valuable part in projecting material towards the arcuate surface of the housing. Given sufficient rigidity and inertia, the shredding ability of rectangular cross section blades varies little with weight and crosssectional dimensions. However, it is possible to influence power consumption and throughput by matching blade size to the material being processed. Thus when processing, say, straw, it would be preferable to use thinner blades than when processing heavier material. In the illustrated embodiment the blades are depicted as pivotally attached to the rotor.This is a preferred arrangement because it permits the blades to encounter foreign bodies, which might be accidentally introduced into the casing, without suffering serious damage. Otherwise there is no reason why they should not be rigidly secured to the rotor. The profile of the arcuate surface should be of a form which ensures that material directed towards it by the rotor blades is directed back into the path of the blades. Preferably, but not essentially, the surface should comprise a series of corrugations or ripples which are generally parallel to the axis of the rotor. The re entrant angle of the ripples should not be so acute as to allow the build up of material therein. On the other hand, the faces presented by the ripples to material flung from the rotor blades should be angled to maximise rebound of material to the blades, and to promote air turbulence.We therefore prefer to employ ripple angles of not less than about 900 and most preferably in the range 100 120 . Generally the ripples will extend in an arc from a point in the housing close to where material is introduced to a point close to the outlet duct. In such a case it may be advisable if ripples in sectors close to the ends of the arc, in particular those at the inlet end, are shallower than those in the mid section to reduce the chance of material build up in the re entrants.While it will be apparent that the number of opportunities for rebound into the path of the rotor blades will be related to the number of ripples in an arcuate surface of given length, it should also be recognised that this is not a linear relationship, since there is a minimum ripple face width which will vary according to material being processed for each ripple face below which the ripple ceases to present sufficient surface for most effective rebound. In other words, with ripples below a certain size, material will tend to strike the ripple tips rather than the ripple faces. With ripple angles of 1000 1300 we have found that, using a rotor of about 400 cm overall diameter, ripples with face widths 1 1.5 cms allow effective processing of a great range of materials. The present invention enjoys a relatively low power consumption compared with prior art roughage processing machinery, for example, a power requirement of about 4kw t hr would be usual when processing straw. This is achieved by avoidance of frictional forces of the sort incurred when material is ground or sheared between opposing elements such as the hammers and screen of a hammer mill. While the machine may, if desired, be run with the blade tips in close proximity to the ripples such a mode of operation is entirely unnecessary and significantly wasteful of power.Preferably the ripples should be at a distance from the rotor tips sufficient to prevent the crushing of material between the moving and fixed elements. For instance when reducing straw to lengths of, say, 2 3 cms, a rotor tip ripple clearance of about 6 mm should prove satisfactory.When different lengths are required, or when processing different materials, the optimum clearance may be other than 6 mm, and for this reason, it is advisable that the rotor be mounted in slidable bearings to permit variation in rotor tip ripple clearance. An obvious alternative to such an arrangement is for the rippled section of the machine casing to be adapted for movement towards or away from the rotor. The nature of the final product is also influenced by rotor tip speed. For example, when processing dry straw to produce 2 3 cms length chaff, a rotor tip speed of about 10,000 cm sec appears to give the best result, but with straw of 50 moisture content a rotor tip speed of about 8,000 cm sec proves more effective. Accordingly for flexibility of operation it is preferable for the rotor to be driven by a variable speed motor. It has previously been mentioned that straw cut in a conventional chaff cutter is far from ideal as a ruminant feedstuff, because the stalks are only cut cross wise and this results in a considerable portion of straw chaff in a ruminant diet passing undigested through the animals alimentary canal. By contrast the present invention operates in two ways to yield a chaff which is substantially more digestible. Firstly, the stalks are usually split open lengthways, thereby exposing the more easily digested inner surface to the action of rumen fluids, and secondly the overall surface area available for attack is increased because the stalks are not clearly cut across in the same way as with a chaff cutter, but are roughly severed to yield edges composed of teased out fibres and incipient longitudinal splits.For instance, when samples of material for the same batch of oaten straw was processed to about 2 cm length in a chaff cutter, hammer mill and a shredder according to this invention, the digestibility of the product over 3 days was found to be 39.7 , 47.4 and 56.4 , respectively, as measured gravimetrically by suspending the material in fine mesh nylon bags in the rumen of live sheep. In the preparation of roughage it is becoming increasingly common to include a treatment with agents, such as acids, alkalis, formic acid, formaldehyde, urea and molasses, which will improve digestibility or palatability, act as a preservative, or otherwise modify the material.A further refinement of this invention is, therefore, the incorporation of means for introducing modifying agents, in gaseous or liquid form, into the casing. For instance, such means might take the form of a perforated pipe located within the casing, and through which the modifying agent may be metered to the material during comminution or as it is being discharged, so that it is atomised and intimately mixed with the material by the action of the rotor blades. Hitherto the machine of this invention has been discussed in terms of its performance as a roughage shredder, in which respect it can be shown to offer significant advantages over prior art devices. However, the machine is further distinguished by its surprising capacity to reduce an apparently limitless range of animal and vegetable materials at power consumption levels not possible with any known equipment.For instance, seeds such as soy, sunflower, safflower, rice, rape, oats and sorghum are quickly and effectively reduced to a fine meal or a gritty meal as governed hf the speed of the rotor with substantial savings about 40 in power consumption compared with processing by a hammer mill likewise leaf crops such as lucerne moreover lengthy materials, such as corn stalks and sugar cane, can be readily processed to a product comprising fine particles in admixture with separated fibres and fibre bundles ranging from 1 cm to 10 cm in length. It is particularly notable that the high moisture content of materials such as sugar cane does not adversely affect the performance of the machine, whereas in similar circumstances, a hammer mill would quickly be brought to a standstill. The machine will also handle woody materials such as tree branches, these being reduced to a mixture of fine particles, chips and fibre bundles which may be passed through the machine one or more times again until in a form suitable for use as a paper making pulp. In the same way as with plant materials, animal products such as offal, bones, fish heads and the like can be fed into the machine and, irrespective of moisture content, rapidly discharged in the form of meal or substantially homogeneous slurry. The machine may also be used for processing municipal waste, after separation of refractory materials to render it more suitable for incineration or for composting.
