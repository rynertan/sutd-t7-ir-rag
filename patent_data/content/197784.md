## Description
METHOD FOR IMMOBILIZING A BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL This invention relates to a method for immobilizing a biological material. More particularly, the invention relates to the immobilization of a biological material wherein the biological material is mixed with a polymer, coated onto glass fibers or matrices and insolubilized by adding a cross linking and or condensing agent. Biological materials, such as enzymes or enzymeproducing microorganisms or cells, are often used as catalysts for synthetic reactions and for analytical techniques. Such catalysts are desirable because they operate with high specificity and efficiency under generally mild reaction conditions. Because enzymes and other biocatalysts are generally water soluble, they are suited for use in batch type reaction systems. Reuse of such enzymes and other biocatalysts is limited because of difficulties in recovering those materials from the spent reaction medium in active or usable form. Moreover, the materials tend to remain in the prepared product as contaminants. In order to avoid these problems, methods have been developed to immobilize biological materials which exhibit catalytic activity on insoluble solid supports.Immobilization is intended to result in a stabilized biological material which can withstand the rigors of repeated or continuous use. Several immobilization systems for biological materials have been reported. Enzymes have been immobilized by absorption onto insoluble materials such as charcoal, glass, cellulose, calcium phosphate gel, montmorillonite and organic ion exchange resins among others. Immobilization also has been achieved by entrapment within starch and acrylamide gels, covalent attachment between enzymes and insoluble organic polymers, and covalent attachment between enzyme molecules themselves. The processes of the prior art often result in products of reduced biological activity when compared with those of the corresponding unbound biological material. These biological materials are known to be sensitive to thermal and chemical denaturation or inactivation. The loss of biological activity often results when immobilizing operations are carried out under harsh conditions which can be particularly problematic when polymer condensation reactions are involved. Furthermore, the products resulting from prior art methods are often disadvantageous with respect to their hydrophilicity, strength, durability, and porosity. Other problems can occur in immobilization systems which employ compressible materials. When a column of immobilized biological material is compressed, channeling, which causes uneven flow during use, may occur. There also may be partial degradation of the column or pressure buildup in the system due to the compressibility of the support material. A further problem with insoluble solid support systems known in the art is their reliance on porous materials with high overall surface area to trap a large amount of biological material. These porous materials may be capable of containing more biological material than other systems, but some substrate molecules are larger than the pores of the support material. In these cases, the substrate cannot diffuse easily into the porous material to react with the biological material. Porous supports are also problematic when smaller substrate molecules are employed because even molecules small enough to diffuse into the pores may not readily do so in large enough quantities to react sufficiently with the immobilized biological material. It is therefore an object of the present invention to develop a method of immobilizing biological materials that does not reduce the biological activity of the products. It is a further object of this invention to develop a method of immobilizing biological materials wherein the insoluble solid support is incompressible. It is a further object of this invention to develop a method of immobilizing biological materials wherein there is a high amount of accessible surface area such that a substrate can readily react with the biological materials. It is a further object of this invention to develop a method of immobilizing biological materials wherein the resulting products exhibit excellent strength, durability, and biological stability. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a method of immobilizing a high quantity of biological material per unit volume of final support. According to one aspect of the present invention, we provide a method of immobilizing a biological material by preparing an insolubilized biological material composite comprising the steps of a coating glass fibers or matrices with a mixture of the biological material and a polymer and b insolubilizing the polymer by applyina a cross linkinq aqent and or a condensinq aqent to the coated qlass ciphers or matrices. It now has been discovered that biological materials can be immobilized on an incompressible support which eliminates the problems of the prior art while maintaining a high degree of catalytic activity in the biological material. The method of the present invention comprises immobilizing biological materials by preparing an insolubilized biological material composite by coating glass fibers or matrices with a mixture of the biological material and a polymer, for example in an aaueous medium, and insolubilizing the polymer by adding a cross linking agent and or a condensing agent.Coating as defined in this invention means any method of applying the biological material to the glass fibers or matrices. The biological material may be in a dry powder form or in an aqueous medium to be mixed with the polymer. Very little loss of activity occurs when the composite is prepared, and such composites exhibit excellent strength and durability. Furthermore, when the polymer is cross linked or condensed, the hydrophilicity of these materials can be adjusted by varying the extent of crosslinking or condensation.Large numbers of tiny glass fibers or filaments, each of which provides surface area on which biological material can be coated, can provide a large total external surface area and avoid the problems encountered with highly porous material wherein substrate molecules are unable to reach and react with the biological material in the pores due to interparticle diffusion. Glass fibers also are incompressible so that channeling, partial degradation of the insoluble support and pressure build up is inhibited. The method of the present invention produces a composite which can be separated from reaction mixtures by simple filtration or used in continuous reaction processes such as those wherein a reacting substrate flows through a packed column reactor. In accordance with the method of the present invention, different types of glass fibers or filaments may be used as the support, including single fibers, matrices of fibers, woven mats, cloth, strand fibers which are continuous or chopped individual fibers, or wool. These glass fibers have good mechanical characteristics, are not compressible, and have no thermal, chemical or biological degrading effect on biological materials. The glass fibers or filaments have a high surface area because every gram of glass provides up to 1 square meter of surface area. The external surface area depends on fiber diameter. When smaller diameters of fiber are used, there is greater utilizable surface area because more fibers can be placed in the same amount of space. The fiber diameter can be as small as 2 microns and may be between 2 10 microns. Generally, the diameter will be between 8 and 20 microns. Using the method of this invention, there is more uniform crosslinking than with other support materials. The glass fibers are coated with a mixture of the biological material to be insolubilized and a polymer, then treated with a cross linking agent or a condensing agent to insolubilize the polymer and link the biological material to the polymer. The polymer optionally may be combined with a carboxylic acid to form a water soluble pre polymer before it is applied to the glass fibers or filaments. The coatings on the glass fibers or filaments should be thin coatings, comprising less than 50 of the total weight of the glass fiber core. The method of the present invention allows the preparation of a wide variety of biological material composites. The biological material can include enzymes, microbial cells, antigens, antibodies, antibiotics, coenzymes, plant cells, animal cells, bacteria, yeasts, fungi, tissue cultures or mixtures thereof. Whole cells can be entrapped within a matrix of glass fibers by allowing the cells to be absorbed into the matrix after coating the fibers and then applying a cross linking agent. The cross linking of the polymer holds the cells within the matrix. It has been discovered that glass fibers or matrices make excellent carriers for the immobilization of biological materials. These fibers or matrices can retain biomass much like porous materials by entrappinq the biomass within a matrix of woven fibers without the attendant disadvantages of porous supports. The glass fibers or matrices exhibit good flow characteristics and provide a high surface area to which the biological materials can be applied, thus ensuring that the biological material will be readily available and accessible to react as required. The immobilization support resulting from this method of immobilizing biological material is rigid and highly active. The polymers used in the method and composites of the present invention generally vary in molecular weiqht, depending on reaction conditions. A variety of polymeric materials can be used in the method of this invention, including polyalkyleneimines, polysaccharides, polyacrylamide, polyurethane, alginate and carageenan.Preferred polymers are polyalkyleneimines, especially polyethyleneimines, polypropyleneimines, polybutyleneimines, and polypentyleneimine, with polyethyleneimine being especially preferred. Polyalkyleneimines can be synthesized by the acidcatalyzed addition polymerization of alkyleneimine monomers. polyethyleneimine PEI is a preferred polyalkyleneimine because it currently is readily available at relatively low cost, and it functions well in the condensation reactions employed in the present method. Polyethyleneimine is produced by ring opening polymerization of ethyleneimine in the presence of catalysts, such as mineral acids. The polymer is highly branched and contains primary, secondary and tertiary amino groups. PEI is water soluble and is conveniently employed as an aqueous solution e.g. containing 50 by weight of PEI upon crosslinking o condensation of the polymer chains, a water insoluble product results. The polyethyleneimine can be crosslinked with an amine cross linking agent to impart additional stability and strength. This treatment results in entrapped biological material, with some crosslinking between the polyalkyleneimine and free amine groups of the biological material. Suitable cross linking agents include glutaraldehyde, diisocyanates, polyisocyanates, 2,4,6 trichloro striazine, bisoxirane, bisimidate, div.nylsulfone, 1,5difluoro 2,4 dinitrobenzene and epoxides.Glutaraldehyde is preferred for this purpose. The polymer chosen generally is added to the composite in an amount sufficient to substantially coat the glass fibers or filaments and this amount will vary depending on the nature of the biological materials and the physical properties desired. The amount of crosslinking agent employed is related to the amount of polymer. t4hen the polymer is polethyleneimine, a highly efficient method of condensation utilizes a polycarboxylic acid PCA to bridge amine groups on adjacent PEI chains. Condensing agents, preferably carbodiimides, readily effect the condensation. The reactions involved in making the condensed polyethyleneimine of the present invention are illustrated below EMI8.1 EMI9.1 Reaction lr illustrates the polymerization of ethyleneimine to form PEI having a branched chain structure, wherein n and n are integers greater than 0 and n may be 0 indicating that the CH2CH2NH group is absent or greater than 0.Reaction 2 shows the formation of a salt of the amine groups of PEI with a polycarboxylic acid, wherein R can be a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon group reactions 3 and 4 show the condensation of the PEI and polycarboxylic acid, using a carbodiimide condensing agent. R and R are hydrocarbon groups which, along with other reactants and conditions of the illustrated reactions, are described more fully below. In general, polycarboxylic acids suited for use in the present invention may be substituted or unsubstituted carboxylic acids having at least two carboxylic groups.Examples of polycarboxylic acids that can be employed in the methods and composites of the present invention include adipic, azelaic, l,ll undecanedioic, 1,12 dodecanedioic, traumtic, pentadecanedioic, hexadecanedioic, sebacic, suberic, glutaric, malonic, pimellic, succinic, malic, maleic, glutamic, aspartic, oxalic, fumaric and polyaspartic acid.Dicarboxylic acids are preferred for use in the present invention and include maleic acid, succinic acid, glutaric and adipic acid. Higher polycarboxylic acids can be any substance that contains two or more carboxylic acid groups, and include high molecular weight polymeric materials, such as polyaspartic acid, having a molecular weight of from 5,000 to 50,000. The condensation reactions are generally exothermic, therefore, the reaction mixtures are advantageously cooled to a temperature that is not deleterious to the biological material being immobilized, e.g., about 37 or lower. The molar ratio of polycarboxylic acid to polyalkyleneimine PCA PAI can vary widely, because of the variation in molecular weight of the reactants.Generally, such ratios range from 1 20 to 1 0.0005. As noted above, to effect condensation of polyalkyleneimine chains through polycarboxylic acids, a condensing agent is advantageously employed. Generally, any condensing agent that catalyzes or facilitates the reaction of amines and carboxylic acids can be used. Examples of such condensing agents include N ethyl S phenyl isoazolium 3 sulfonate, n ethoxycarbonyl 2 ethoxy 1, 2 dihydroquinoline, and various carbodiimides.Carbodiimide condensing agents are preferred, and those that can be used in the composition of the present invention have the formula R N C N Rz where R and Rt are hydrocarbyl groups containing from 3 to about 20 carbon atoms, preferably from about 5 to about 12 carbon atoms. Such condensing agents include l ethyl 3,3dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide, dicyclohexyl carbodiimide, l cyclohexyl 3 2 morpholinoethyl carbodiimidemetho p toluene sulphonate, or salts thereof. Carbodiimide condensing aqents are added to the reaction mixture in a condensing amount, which generally is substantially a stoichiometric amount e.g. from about 0.2 to 3 times, preferably from about 0.5 to 1.5, a stoichiometric amount. Each carbodiimide molecule reacts with a single acid group of the polycarboxylic acid. For example, carbodiimide to dicarboxylic acid molar ratios of about 2 1 are generally used in the method of the present invention. Upon addition of the condensing agent at room temperature, noticeable polymerization results within thirty seconds, and is generally complete within about two hours. When the polyethyleneimine has been insolubilized by the addition of a condensing agent, an optional post treatment step involves crosslinking the condensed, coated glass fibers or filaments with an amine crosslinking agent, such as glutaraldehyde, as described above, to provide additional strength and stability to the final composite. Depending upon the type of polymer chosen, a variety of condensing and cross linking agents may be selected from those known in the art to strengthen the composite. Preferred combinations for this invention are PEI and glutaraldehyde, PEI and epoxy compounds, or PEI and a polycarboxylic acid in conjunction with a carbodiimide. In the following examples, immobilization procedures of this invention are described in greater detail. These examPles set forth various embodiments of the invention but are not to be construed as limiting. Example I A crude preparation of glucoamylase enzyme was immobilized onto chopped glass fibers. The enzyme, 4.0 grams, was mixed with 0.45 grams of 50 aqueous polyethyleneimine until uniform, and then mixed with 2.4 grams of fibers.Glutaraldehyde 4cc of a 25 solution in water was added slowly and stirred until evenly distributed. After drying, the material was washed in water and packed into a column with a bed volume of 8.0cc. A 30 partially hydrolyzed starch substrate was passed through the column at 3.6cc hr 0.45 SV h . The effluent was monitored for glucoamylase activity by measuring the amount of glucose with a colorimetric determination using o toluidine. The initial productivity of the column was 105 grams glucose liter bed volume hour. The column was operated continuously for 65 days at 600C, and at the end of this time the productivity was 57 gm liter bed volume hr. Example II E. coli cell paste, having an aspartase activity of 46,200 units, was used in a whole cell immobilization on fiberglass. The support was prepared by twisting together several lengths of 408 filament strand glass fibers to form matrices, each having a total weight of about 0.5 grams. A coating mixture was prepared consisting of 6 grams of the E. coli cell paste mixed with 24cc distilled water and 0.75 grams of 50 aqueous polyethyleneimine. When the mixture appeared uniform, 2,5cue was pipetted evenly onto each 0.5 gram section of vertically suspended fibers, and allowed to dry for 15 minutes. Glutaraldehyde then was pipetted over top of the coating 0.42cc of a 5 solution in water and left to dry overnight. In all, a total of 2 grams of glass were used with IOcc of coating. The material was cut into 0.5cm pieces and packed into a column with a final bed volume of 7.6cc and a density of 0.26 grams cell paste cc. The column then was used to convert ammonium fumarate to L aspartic acid. A 1.8M solution of ammonium fumarate with 7mM magnesium sulfate, pH 8.5, at 370C was passed through the column at 4.2cc hr 0.55 SV h . The effluent was monitored for aspartase activity by measuring the disppearance of fumaric acid using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 240nM. An average of 99.2 conversion of the substrate was maintained for 5 days of continuous column operation. Example III The E. coli paste of Example II also was used for whole cell immobilization onto a fiber matrix with a density of 0.102 gram cc. The cell paste 20 grams was mixed with 2.5 grams polyethyleneimine until uniform and then mixed with 0.7 grams of the fiberglass matrix.Glutaraldehyde 3.3 grams of a 25 solution was then added slowly, with stirring, and the mixture was allowed to dry for 1 hour. The material was packed into a column having a final bed volume of 22.4cc and a cell paste density of 0.5 grams cc. The column converted 99.8 of a 1.8M ammonium fumarate substrate at 16.4cc hr. single pass 0.74 SV h and 37µC. Example IV Viable cells of a Bacillus species known to produce alkaline protease enzyme were immobilized onto a fiber matrix having a density of 0.115 grams cc. Cell paste was harvested from a fermentation broth with alkaline protease activity of 16,000 delft units ml. The cell paste 2 grams was mixed aseptically with 3cc sterile water and 0.25 grams of 50 agueouspolyethyleneimine. Then 0.7 grams of the fiber matrix was added and allowed to soak for 15 minutes. The fiberglass was removed and placed in a beaker of 10 ml of a 5 glutaraldehyde solution to soak for 5 minutes, then washed in the substrate a 10 diluted fermentation medium . The immobilized whole cell material was placed in a batch reactor at 37iC containing 20 ml of media consistinq of a carbon and nitrogen source and a continuous supply of dissolved oxygen. Samples were taken for 24 hours to monitor the production of alkaline protease by measuring enzymatic activity using a casein substrate. Alkaline protease production increased during the bioreactor operation demonstrating production of the enzyme by the immobilized cells. Example V Rhodotorula rubra cells containing the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase were immobilized onto a fiberglass matrix material. The matrix material was composed of individual fibers in bundles and the overall density of the matrix was 0.115 gm cc. A solution containing R. rubra cells, at 108 dry weight, was prepared, and polyethyleneimine PEI was added to the solution until a 10 PEI concentration resulted. Two grams of the glass fiber matrix material then was allowed to soak in the solution. The material was removed and soaked in a 12.5 glutaraldehyde solution for 5 minutes, then removed and thoroughly washed. The R. rubra cells did not visually wash out of the support material during washings. The immobilized R. rubra cells then were used to make Lphenylalanine from ammonium cinnamate. Fifty milliliters of a 60mM cinnamate, 6M ammonia, pB 10.0 substrate solution was placed in a beaker with the immobilizedR. rubra cells for 18 hours at room temperature. Over 2 grams of L phenylalanine was produced per liter of initial substrate.
