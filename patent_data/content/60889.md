# CABLE CLAMP.

## Abstract
A cable clamp formed by superposing a hanging bellshaped packing 14 , a guide ring 13 having a bore and a clamping ring 20 having a plurality of inwardly inclined flexible pawl pieces 21 between an outside housing 1 and an inside housing 7 capable of engaging with one another, and by resiliently attaching a hanging bellshaped packing 14 to the outer periphery of the inserted cable, spirally inserting the inside housing 7 into the outside housing 1 and thus clamping the cable with the flexible pawl pieces 21 of the ring 20 . This clamp can prevent water from entering and effectively clamp cables of various bore diameters without replacing parts by the cable clamping action of the clamping ring and the waterproofing action of the packing 14 .
