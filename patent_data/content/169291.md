## Description
An external speed display device for motor vehicles The present invention concerns a device for the external display of the speed au automobiles for allowing the ascertainment of the speed in case of collision.It is known that a motorist on the road can only provide two types of information he can let others know if he is braking, or that je is going to pass, or that he is going to turn right or left. If he brakes, one is not able to know how hard he is braking nor how much he can diminish the distance with respect to an overtaking car.From a distance one cannot even tell if the car is moving or not, or if the speed of the car behind is double or triple his own. If he passes it could be untimely. Therefore the motorist in the car ahead of us can tell us if he is applying the brakes, passing or turning, but he cannot signal the most important thing, that is the speed at which he is travelling. If we knew his speed, in fact, we would be able to see if it was decreasing and if so by how much. Knowing the speed of the car in front of us would enable us to react correctly even if the driver neglected to signal a turn or pass.In so far as speed is perhaps the element that most under mines the safety of travellers on the road, the invention resolves a problem that until know has been totally neglected. Since it offers primary information for the prevention of accidents, namely the automatic and constant declara tion of travelling speed, It puts a stop to misleading and dangerous visual evaluation of the speed of other vehicles.The device, according to the invention, has the dimensions of a normal car fender and can be positioned either under or over the front and rear fenders of motor vehicles.It consists of a rectangular dial, longitudinally graduated, along which an Indicator, appearing as a coloured band with an upward pointing asymetrical point moves, getting longer as speed increases and shorter as speed decreases.This visual effect is determined by the rotation of a shaft, coloured diagonally, situated behind the graduated slots of the dial, and is activated by forces that depend on speed.In a slightly different version the indicator is orange in colour, easily visible form a distance during the day, il luminated at night, advancing from left to right and intensifying in colour as the speed of the vehicle Increases.The dimensions of the Invented device are expected to correspond to the width of the motor vehicle to which it will be attached in order to ensure the best visibility.The device, in addition, serves a second purpose it is e quipped with a mechanism that activates, by electrical contact, a flashing light situated on the extreme right whenever the indicator exceeds the maximum speed allowed that type of vehicle. At the same time an internal acoustic signal or luminous intermittent dial located on the instrument panel is also activated. By means of such a device both driver and others are warned that the vehicle is travelling at a speed superior to that permitted and is therefore in dangerous conditions.The eventual choice of the colour blue for the flashing light outside is suggested by the blue flashing lights normally ysed by emergency vehicles ambulances etc. .And finally a third function is performed by the device. It is realized in such a way that in case of collision the consequent deformation of the vehicle causes the instant blocking of the speed indicator at the moment of collision. This enables us to reveal the exact speed of motor vehicles involved in accidents at the moment of impact. This result is obtained by means of a shaft indicator that rotates inside a cylindrical tube of rigid transparent plastic which is coaxial to it and slightly larger in diameter. This, in turn, is fixed to the frame of the vehicle. The external surface of this tube is graduated while the internal surface is lined with a sheet of soft transparent plastic. The shaft has a sharp triangular toothed thread running along the helical line separating the orange from the neutral colour.Following deformation caused by collision, the shaft will exert pressure, directly proportional to the force of impact, on the internal surface of the tube in one or more points. In those points, because the surface is impressionable, It will groove due to the wedging effect of the corner of the thread, as it happens in a nut for bolts and screws.The external surface of the tube is graduated in helical lines, one for every degree of speed, parallel to the development of the thread tooth. Every unit degree of speed is repeated at a close distance along the whole line. In such a way even if worse comes to worse and vehicle disintegrates, it will always be possible to find a piece of the grooved tube. The groove corresponds to a number which will be equivalent to the speed of the vehicle at the moment of impact.In order to be efficient in the case of lateral collisions as well the invention provides for the presence of a thin steel cable that connects the graduated tubes to the ends of the front and read speedometers. This cable runs along the side of the vehicle inside a conducting tube with pulleys conveniently located In those points where it is necessary to go aorund the curves of the wheels. In the case of lateral impact the length of the cable will be strain ed and it will pull the ends together sharply thus damaging both speedometers which will remain deformed. In this way the invention fulfills its third purpose.The invention therefore serves three purposes 1 it provides an external indication of the speed of a mo tor vehicle 2 it warns the driver as well as others whenever the ve hicle exceeds the speed limit 3 it records the speed of vehicles involved in accidents at the moment of collision.By carrying out these functions the device enables us to achieve results which are of great civic value in so far as the device proves to be 1 an instrument intenden for the regulation of traffic and therefore safety 2 an instrument for the exercise of self discipline and discipline on the road 3 an instrument serving the forces of law and order in so far as in the case of accident or collision it performs a function similar to and as important as that of the black box used on airliners.The invention is explained in detail hereinbelow according to the attached drawings which show a preferred embodiment and in which figures 1, 2, 3 respectively show an external view of the device and the way it works attached to the front and rear of a vehicle.Figures 4, 5, 6 and 7 show the shaft indicator, the development of the graduated tube s surface, the shaft indicator housed in the graduated tube and the transversal section of the complete device.Figures 8 and 9 show a plant and lateral view of the steel cable mechanism, for the ascertainment of lateral colli sions. Referring to the details of the illustrations, the device consists of fig. 1 the rectangular dial 7 externally graduated 8 and the flashing blue light 9. Attached to the rear of a vehicle 2 the indicator 1 is pointing to a certain value which corresponds to that indicated by 1 fig. 3 in which the device appears on the front of the vehicle.It should be noted that when the device attached to the front fender is seen in the rearview mirror of a preceeding vehicle the scale reads from left to right and the flashing light appears on the extreme right exactly as the device attached to the rear bumper appears when seen from behind.Regarding the internal structure of the device as seen in figures 4, 5, 6 and 7 the device, according to the invention, presents the shaft indicator 6 with thread 1 and cop per foil 2 which determins the contact for activating the falshing blue light and simultaneously the internal visual and or acoustic signal, following to the rotation of the shaft operated, in a well known electric, electronic or mechanical way, according to the speed of the vehicle.In fact, it is evident that when the speed of the vehicle increases, shaft 6 rotates and therefore the helical shape of indicator or thread 1 moves towards the end, being now visible along externally graduated dial 8 so as to provide the externally visible information about the speed.The graduated tube in figure 5 shows its developped surface and is marked to show values up to 140 km hr where 1 is equivalent to 10 km hr, 2 to 20 km hr, 3 to 30 km hr and so on. All are repeated along respective helical lines as is shown with a succession of some of the numbers possible in the sequence. The section of the shaft located inside the cylindrical tube fig. 7 shows the thickness 3 of the tube, the layer of soft plastic 4 that lines the interior of the tube, the space 5 between the tube and the shaft, the thread 1 and the shaft itself 6.The sketches concerning lateral collisions figures 8 and 9 show the steel cable 10 stretched between the front speedometer 7 . The pulleys are indicated by 11 and the fenders with hard rubber bumpers to protect the speedometer in case of light impact. In a different variety the mechanism for activating the visual and or acoustic alarm could be put on the speedometer on the instrument panel, thus using a mass produced instrument. Naturally, the device for recording of speed In case of accident could be of smaller dimensions than the one presented. Moreover, the external speed indicator could be realized in a different form, with different dimensions or even a different way of operating.For example, there could be a series of different coloured blinking lights to which conventional speed limits are asssigned or there could be an illuminated digital speedometer.
