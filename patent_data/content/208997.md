# Control system and method with diagnostic logic.

## Abstract
A system and method for controlling operation of a plural ity of elements in an automated process, such as a production process, and indicating error conditions as they occur. Each unique set of input and output conditions of the various system elements defines a unique logic state or zone. Thus, there are defined a multiplicity of valid system logic states or zones, each having a unique input output image. A predetermined se quence of zones, productive zones representing designed ma chine operations, is stored in a zone table. All zones not ex plicitly defined in the zone table are automatically treated as er ror zones. A zone engine automatically cycles to observe any change in input output image. Any change in inputs from the various system elements automatically transfer action to the unique zone associated with such inputs, resulting in corre sponding changes in control outputs to the system elements and or display an error message as appropriate.
