## Description
Decontaminating distilled water withdrawing meansThe present invention concerns a means for withdrawing distilled water comprising a distilled water withdrawal tube communicating with a pipeline along which the distilled water has been disposed to flow and provided with a valve means.In the Finnish patent application No. 821483 has been disclosed a distilled water storage tank which is based on so called hot storage. In a storage tank of this type no substantial impairment of distillate quality takes place, not even during prolonged storage.In the Finnish patent application No. 821534 has been disclosed a distilled water distribution system by the aid of which distilled water is conducted from a storage tank by a distribution system having the form of a pipeline, to various points of use. In this distribution system of prior art, the pipeline has been constructed to be a bead like pipeline having no completely horizontal portions whatsoever, nor any abrupt bends. Each withdrawal valve is located in the pipeline at such withdrawal points where the distilled water is at a lowest point in the pipeline. In a distribution system of this kind, the quality of the distilled water remains good, owing to the circulation and to the high temperature, through a period long enough, even behind each valve although a given valve might not be opened during a prolonged period.At present, the problem is encountered in the withdrawing of distilled water that the distilled water cannot be withdrawn in adequately sterile condition. In designs of prior art, the withdrawal tube leads from the distillate tank, and the lower part of the withdrawal tube has been provided with a swivelling protective cup.The withdrawal tube is naturally also fitted with a sanitation valve. A design like this fails to guarantee withdrawal of distilled ed water in sterile condition, even when the distilled water is withdrawn hot, because the ambient air invariably contains microbes causing the distilled water to become potentially non sterile.It is desired in certain applications to withdraw the distilled water at a temperature significantly lower than about 40 C.Designs of prior art are not applicable in such uses because the distilled water withdrawal will be non sterile.The object of the invention is to provide a distilled water withdrawing means allowing sterile withdrawal of distilled water both as hot and also at a lower temperature.The aim of the invention is attained with a withdrawing means which is mainly characterized in that a heating member has been disposed to heat at least the lower part of the withdrawal tube so that the temperature at least of the lower part is always higher than the desired minimum temperature.The other characteristic features of the withdrawing means of the invention are stated in claims 2 5.It has been understood in the design taught by the invention to keep the withdrawal tube, or at least its lower part, always above 0 a given minimum temperature, such as e.g. 90 C, by effect of which the microbes in the air are destroyed and the water is always withdrawn in sterile condition. The heating of the withdrawal tube is advantageously carried out with the aid of electric heating.The invention is described in detail with reference to certain advantageous embodiments, presented in the figures of the attached drawing, but to which the invention is not meant to be exclusively confined.Fig. 1 presents a distilled water withdrawing means according to the invention, intended for so called cold withdrawal, in schematical elevational view.Fig. 2 presents a distilled water withdrawing means according to the invention, intended for so called hot withdrawal, in schematical elevational view.In the embodiment of Fig. 1, the distilled water flows continuously in the pipeline 11 and the temperature of the distilled water is at least a given minimum temperature, such as 800C for instance. From the pipeline 11 leads a distilled water withdrawal tube 12, of which the lower part has been indicated with the reference numeral 12a. The withdrawal tube 12 has been provided with a sanitation valve 13. The withdrawal tube 12 has been disposed to pass through a liquid container 14. Into the liquid container 14 is conducted e.g. cold water through the pipe 15. The temperature of the cold o water may be e.g. 15 C. The valve in the pipe 15 has been denoted with 16, and the liquid container is provided with a drain pipe 17.The lower part 12a of the withdrawal tube 12 has been provided with a swivelling protective cup 18 known in the art in itself. The design solution depicted in Fig. 1 is intended for so called cold withdrawal, where it is desired to withdraw the water at a temperature for instance about 400C.In accordance with the fundamental insight of the invention, at least the lower part 12a of the withdrawal tube 12 is heated so that the temperature of the lower part 12a of the withdrawal tube is always over a given minimum temperature T , such as 900C for min instance. In the present embodiment, the heating has been carried out with the aid of an electric heater element 19. Thanks to this design, the microbes in the air are destroyed and the distilled water keeps reliably sterile, even in cold withdrawal.The withdrawing means depicted in Fig. 2 is intended for so called hot withdrawal. The construction of Fig. 2 is substantially the same as that shown in Fig. 1, but the design of Fig. 2 lacks the cooling liquid container structure with its associated input and output connectors. In the embodiment of Fig. 2, the distilled water flows in the pipeline 11, having a temperature e.g. of 80 c. The withdrawal tube 12 has been fitted with a sanitation valve 13. In this design, too, at least the lower part 12a of the withdrawal tube 12 is heated so as to keep the temperature at least of the lower part 12a always higher than a given minimum temperature T min such as 90 C for instance. As a result, the distilled water will always be withdrawn in hot withdrawal in sterile condition. In the foregoing merely two embodiments of the invention have been presented, and it is obvious to a person skilled in the art that numerous modifications thereof are feasible, within the scope of the inventive idea presented in the attached claims.
