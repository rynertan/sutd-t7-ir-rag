# Apnea monitor.

## Abstract
A respiration monitor and x ray trigger apparatus, wherein analog respiration signals 198 are amplified and divided 200 into respiratory and heartbeat components. The analog respiratory components are processed 300 , digitized and further processed to yield indications of respiratory extrema 400 and respiration rate 600 . The analog heartbeat components are processed 800 to give indications of heartbeat rate 900 . A trigger signal is se lectively generated 700 to the x ray machine just prior to occurrence of a selected respiration extrema. The value of the respiration signal at a sample occurring just after detection of the selected extrema is stored, and modified. Apnea alarms are generated 1000 if a predetermined decrease in respiration rate is detected in successive pe riods in conjuction with a predetermined nimber of decel erating heart beats. An alarm is also generated 1100 if the respiration and heart rates are equal for a prederter mined number of periods or if the respiration of heart rates stray outside of preset threshold values.
