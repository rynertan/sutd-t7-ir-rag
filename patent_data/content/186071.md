# Transdermal system for timolol.

## Abstract
A system for administering timolol for an extended period is described. The system comprises a backing mem ber 11 substantially impermeable to the drug, a drug reservoir member 12 , consisting essentially of timolol as the drug and carrier therefor, and a rate controlling member 15 . By the system, transdermal application of timolol may be accomplished with substantially no irritation to the skin.
