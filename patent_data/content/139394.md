# SELF FEEDING WATER HEATING BOILER

## Abstract
A self feeding water heating boiler for dispensing hot water for beverage making purposes has an electric immer sion heater 18 in a boiling chamber 12 which communi cates at the top through a steam pipe 26 with an overhead condenser 14 containing the sensing element 30 of a steam responsive thermostat arranged to control a solenoid operated water supply inlet valve 36 . Incoming fresh water admitted through the inlet valve 36 is fed first to the condenser 14 where in it is sprayed through a nozzle 32a directly onto the thermostat sensing element 30 and collects to provide a permanent cooling reservoir in the bottom part of the condenser before passing through an outlet 38, 40 to a feed tank 16 provided with a water level sensor which also controls the inlet valve 36 . Water from the feed tank 16 is delivered to the lower part of the boiling chamber 12 . The arrangement leads to improved control by the steam thermostat of the water supply feed and mainte nance of near boiling temperature within the boiling chamber.
