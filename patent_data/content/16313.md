# Stable aqueous copper zirconium complex salt solutions, their preparation and use.

## Abstract
Stable aqueous copper zirconium complex salt solutions are provided for enhancing the resistance to rot of cotton fabrics, comprising a copper zirconium ammonium carbonate complex salt and a vicinal diol compound having the formula R₁CHOHCHOHR₂, wherein R₁ and R₂ are selected from the group consisting of carboxylic acid groups and salts thereof and organic radicals having at least two carbon atoms and at least one hydroxyl group, and if only one of R₁ and R₂ be carboxylic acid or salt, the organic radical has at least two hydroxyl groups.
