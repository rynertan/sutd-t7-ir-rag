# Paint roller assembly.

## Abstract
A paint roller assembly comprises a plurality of relatively rigid segments 33,36A,36B,36C,34 fastened together in a stack and rotatably mounted on a tube 12 . The segments have grooves 35A G in their radial faces which, when placed in juxtaposition with the adjacent segment, form baffled passageways. End seals are provided so that, when paint is supplied to a chamber 72 in the centre of the stack, it will depart through passageways between the segments of the roller in a controlled manner. A replaceable sock like roller cover 77 is mounted on the outer surface of the paint roller assembly. The paint roller assembly can be easily and completely disassembled for cleaning and seal replacement when needed.
