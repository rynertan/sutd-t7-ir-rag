# A sensor for generating electrical signals representative of relative motion.

## Abstract
A displacement current sensor for generating electrical signals representative of relative motion between a con ductor 11 and an electric field source 12 . The sensor includes means 12 for generating an electric field and electrically conductive means 11 positioned for inter action with the electric field, the field generating means 12 and the electrically conductive means 11 being relat ively movable so that variations in the field encountered by the electrically conductive means induces a displace ment current, as opposed to a conduction current, in the electrically conductive means 11 . The field generating means 12 preferably is fabricated from an electret formed in any one of a wide variety of geometrical shapes, such as planar, cylindrical or special geometrical configura tions the electrically conductive means 11 may com prise one or more plates, wires, rods, or other special shapes.
