# 3 Methylflavone 8 carboxylic acid esters.

## Abstract
3 Methylflavone 8 carboxylic acid esters I are provided. They may be prepared by condensing a 3 methylflavone 8 carboxylic acid halide preferably the chloride with an aminoalcohol ZOH. Condensation conditions are a no solvent, 140 200 C, excess flavone derivative or b organic solvent, 0 C to reflux, equimolar reactant proportions, hyd rogen halide acceptor optional. The esters have muscle relaxant and calcium blocking action. They are also anaes thetics and anti inflammatory agents.
