# Process for the temperature control of a drying apparatus for tabacco leaves.

## Abstract
A process for controlling the temperature of a cut tobacco leaves drying apparatus including a cylindrical rotor having a plurality of heating means which are arrayed in an advance direction of raw material independently of each other is provided. The process comprises the steps of determining a temperature preset value to provide an optimum drying temperature at each section upon basis of the flow rate characteristics at the section, an operated value based upon the measure values of the flow rate and the moisture rate of the cut tobacco leaves and a given value preliminarily preset for the section controlling the heating means in accordance with the preset value and feedback controlling at least the last one of the heating means based upon the measured value of the moisture rate of the dried tobacco leaves discharged from the rotor. The preliminarily preset given value is a value for providing a final target value at each section of the rotor with a temperature gradient which is increased from the entrance to the exit of the rotor.
