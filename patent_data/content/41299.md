# Fat blend substantially free of hydrogenated and interesterified fats and use of said fat blend in margarines.

## Abstract
The invention relates to natural fat blends which can be used for producing margarines which are packaged in wrap pers. The blends comprise i a specific stearin obtained by fractionation of oils and fats, derived from fatty acids with an average chain length ranging from 12 to 18 carbons atoms and ii oils and fats derived from fatty acids with a chain length ranging from 12 to 14 carbon atoms, in proportions such that the amount of glycerides derived from tri saturated fatty acids with a chain length of 12 to 14 C atoms ranges from 7 to 14 and with a chain length of 16 to 18 C atoms ranges from 7 to 12 .
