## Description
The conversion of lower alcohols, including methanol, to various products such as gasoline, olefins, and or distillates is an important area of technology which has been described in the patent and technical literature. The particularly advantageous catalysts which are utilized in the conversion of methanol are a special class of crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites having a silica to alumina ratio greater than 12 and a Constraint Index within the approximate range of 1 to 12. A typical material of this type is zeolite ZSM 5. There are many patents and publications which describe the conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons such as gasoline, olefins and or distillates over these zeolites including United States Patents 3,931,349 3,969,426 3,899,544 3,894,104 3,904,916 3,894,102 4,025,576 4,374,295 and 4,083,889. Steaming under certain circumstances can enhance the activity of acid catalyzed reactions and such is disclosed in United States 4,326,994. Steaming can enhance the stability of zeolite catalysts for various acid catalyzed reactions as well as methanol conversion and such is disclosed in United States 4,429,176. Treatment with phosphorus and or steam can extend the life of an isomerization catalyst as shown in United States 4,423,266. Despite these many improvements, it would be beneficial if a way could be found to improve the stability of methanol conversion catalysts. A way has now been discovered to improve the catalyst stability by a pretreatment step. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of preparing a catalyst of a zeolite with a Constraint Index of 1 to 12 and a silica to alumina ratio of at least 12 and a binder characterized by forming a composite of the zeolite and a silica binder, and steaming the composite with steam at a temperature of 400 to 600 C for 2 to 100 hours and acid extracting the composite in the 0.1 to 10 N mineral acid at 15 to 100 C for 0.5 to 10 hours. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a catalyst characterized by the above mentioned method of preparation. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a process for the conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons wherein methanol is contacted at elevated temperatures over a zeolite catalyst composited with a binder, having a zeolite silica to alumina ratio of at least 12 and a Constraint Index of 1 to 12, characterized in that the zeolite is composited with silica and thereafter the composite is subjected to steaming and acid extraction prior to use in the methanol conversion process. The crystalline zeolites utilized herein are members of a particular class of zeolitic materials which exhibit unusual properties. Although these zeolites have unusually low alumina contents, i.e. high silica to alumina mole ratios, they are very active even when the silica to alumina mole ratio exceeds 30. These zeolites provide constrained access to and egress from the intracrystalline free space by virtue of having an effective pore size intermediate between the small pore Linde A and the large pore Linde X, i.e., the pore windows of the structure are of about a size such as would be provided by 10 membered rings of silicon atoms interconnected by oxygen atoms. These rings are formed by the regular disposition of the tetrahedra making up the anionic framework of the crystalline zeolite, the oxygen atoms themselves being bonded to the silicon or aluminum, etc. atoms at the centers of the tetrahedra. The silica to alumina mole ratio referred to may be determined by conventional analysis. This ratio represents the ratio in the rigid anionic framework of the zeolite crystal and excludes aluminum in the binder or in cationic or other form within the channels. Although zeolites with a silica to alumina ratio of at least 12 are useful, it is preferred in some applications to use zeolites having higher silica alumina ratios of at least 30. Zeolites which are substantially free of aluminum, i.e. having silica to alumina mole ratios of 1600 and higher, are useful and and even preferable in some instances. Such high silica zeolites are intended to be included within this description. The particular class of zeolites, after activation, acquire an intracrystalline sorption capacity for normal hexane which is greater than that for water, i.e., they exhibit hydrophobic properties. This hydrophobic character can be used to advantage in some applications. The particular class of zeolites useful herein have an effective pore size such as to freely sorb normal hexane. Rather than attempt to judge from crystal structure whether or not a zeolite possesses the necessary constrained access to molecules of larger cross section than normal paraffins, a simple determination of the Constraint Index may be made by passing continuously a mixture of an equal weight of normal hexane and 3 methylpentane over a sample of zeolite at atmospheric pressure according to the following procedures. A sample of the zeolite, in the form of pellets or extrudate, is crushed to a particle size about that of coarse sand and mounted in a glass tube. Prior to testing, the zeolite is treated with a stream of air at 540 C. for at least 15 minutes. The zeolite is then flushed with helium and the temperature is adjusted between 290 C. and 510 C. to give an overall conversion of between 10 and 60 . The mixture of hydrocarbons is passed at 1 liquid hourly space velocity i.e., 1 volume of liquid hydrocarbon per volume of zeolite per hour over the zeolite with a helium dilution to give a helium to total hydrocarbon mole ratio of 4 1. After 20 minutes on stream, a sample of the effluent is taken and analyzed, most conveniently by gas chromatography, to determine the fraction remaining unchanged for each of the two hydrocarbons. It may be necessary to use more severe conditions for samples of very low activity, such as those having an exceptionally high silica to alumina mole ratio. In those instances, a temperature of up to about 540 C. and a liquid hourly space velocity of less than one, such as 0.1 or less, can be employed in order to achieve a minimum total conversion of about 10 . The Constraint Index is calculated as follows Constraint Index The Constraint Index approximates the ratio of the cracking rate constant for the two hydrocarbons. Zeolites suitable for the present invention are those having a Constraint Index of 1 to 12. Constraint Index CI values for, and patents disclosing, some typical materials are Constraint Index varies with severity of operation conversion and the presence or absence of binders. Likewise, other variables such as crystal size of the zeolite, the presence of occluded contaminants, etc., may affect the Constraint Index. Therefore, it will be appreciated that it may be possible to so select test conditions as to establish more than one value in the range of 1 to 12 and one or more values slightly outside this range for the Constraint Index of a particular zeolite. Such a zeolite exhibits the constrained access as herein defined and is to be regarded as having a Constraint Index in the range of 1 to 12. The particular class of zeolites defined herein is exemplified by ZSM 5, ZSM 11, ZSM 12, ZSM 23, ZSM 35, ZSM 38, ZSM 48, and other similar materials. Identification of zeolites should be resolved on the basis of their respective X ray diffraction patterns. It is the crystal structure, as identified by the X ray diffraction fingerprint , which establishes the identity of the specific crystalline zeolite material. The specific zeolites described, are usually activated by heating in an inert atmosphere at 540 C. for one hour, for example, followed by base exchange with ammonium salts followed by calcination at 540 C. in air for 15 minutes to 24 hours. Natural zeolites may sometimes be converted to zeolite structures of the class herein identified by various activation procedures and other treatments such as base exchange, steaming, alumina extraction and calcination, alone or in combinations. Natural minerals which may be so treated include ferrierite, brewsterite, stilbite, dachiardite, epistilbite, heulandite, and clinoptilolite. The preferred zeolites are ZSM 5, ZSM 11, ZSM 12, ZSM 23, ZSM 35, ZSM 38, and ZSM 48, with ZSM 5 being particularly preferred. In a preferred aspect of this invention, the zeolites have a crystal framework density, in the dry hydrogen form, of not less than about 1.6 grams per cubic centimeter. When the crystal structure is unknown, the crystal framework density may be determined by classical pyknometer techniques. For example, it may be determined by immersing the dry hydrogen form of the zeolite in an organic solvent which is not sorbed by the crystal. Or, the crystal density may be determined by mercury porosimetry, since mercury will fill the intenstices between crystals but will not penetrate the intracrystalline free space. It is possible that the unusual sustained activity and stability of this special class of zeolites is associated with its high crystal anionic framework density of not less than about 1.6 grams per cubic centimeter. This high density must necessarily be associated with a relatively small amount of free space within the crystal, which might be expected to result in more stable structures. This free space, however, is important as the locus of catalytic activity. Crystal framework densities of some typical zeolites, including some which are not within the purview of this invention, are When synthesized in the alkali metal form, the zeolite is conveniently converted to the hydrogen form. The original alkali metal of the zeolite may be replaced by ion exchange with other suitable metal cations of Groups I through VIII of the Periodic Table, including, by way of example, nickel, copper, zinc, palladium, calcium or rare earth metals. It has long been recognized in the art that silica is a desirable matrix and that it possessed advantages over alumina with regard to certain catalytic reactions. In this connection, United States 4,013,732 specifically discloses ZSM 5 with a silica matrix at column 7. A preferred method of forming the silica zeolite composite is extrusion. In this process a zeolite, such as ZSM 5 is mixed with water and an alkali metal base, such as sodium hydroxide, wherein the amount of water added is sufficient to provide a total solids content of 25 to 75 weight percent and the alkali metal compound is added in an amount of 0.5 to 10 weight percent on a dry basis based on the total solids and calculated as sodium hydroxide equivalent followed by mulling and extruding through any conventional extruder. The extrudate is then subjected to a combination of steaming and acid extraction to enhance the stability of a catalyst. Although extrusion is preferred, it is also possible to use other conventional catalyst forming techniques to make catalyst composite suitable for the pretreatment process of the present invention. Oil drop gelation, marumerizing, pilling, and other conventional forming techniques may be used, but not necessarily with equivalent results. It should also be possible to allow a well mixed mass of silica and zeolite to dry in the form of a sheet or clumps, and then subject this material to controlled crushing and screening to obtain the desired particle size for use in the catalyst reactor. The order of steaming and acid extraction is not critical and one can be carried out prior to the other. The preferred order of treatment, however, is steaming followed by acid extraction. Steaming is generally carried out by contacting the silica zeolite composite with steam at a temperature of from 400 C to 600 C for 2 to 100 hours. Steam can either be a 100 steam or diluted with air or inert gas, at atmospheric pressure, or at an elevated pressure. The acid extraction is carried out by contacting the extrudate either before or after steaming with a strong acid such as nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, etc. at 15 C to 100 C for 0.5 to 10 hours. The strength of the acid is not narrowly critical and can vary from 0.1 to 10.0 normal. Following the treatment with both steam and acid, the resulting zeolite silica composite is usually washed with water, dried and calcined at elevated temperatures ranging from 400 C to 600 C for a period of time ranging from 0.5 to 16 hours. The methanol conversion process using zeolites with a Constraint Index of 1 12 is well known and is carried out at elevated temperatures and pressures ranging from atmospheric to 3,500 kPa 500 psig at a space velocity ranging from 0.5 to 4 depending upon whether olefins or aromatics are the desired product. 65 wt ZSM 5 and 35 wt silica were bound together by mulling the zeolite as synthesized with silica Hi Sil 233 while adding water containing 3 wt NaOH and extruding through a 1.6 mm 1 16th inch die plate. The material was then calcined by heating in nitrogen at 538 C for 3 hours, ammonium exchanged, washed, calcined in air at 538 C for 3 hours, and then steamed for 16.5 hours at 538 C. in 100 steam. The steamed catalyst was then twice extracted with two normal nitric acid at 75 C. for 1 hour, washed and recalcined at 538 C. for 1 hour. The above catalyst was then evaluated for methanol conversion to olefins and compared with other catalysts. In each case, the zeolite employed was ZSM 5. The results are shown in the following table. Catalyst A which had an alumina binder and was not subjected to steaming and acid extraction had the highest alpha value but had the worse stability Days to Methanol Breakthrough 4 . When the alumina catalyst B was subjected to steaming its Days to Methanol Breakthrough increased to 18. When a silica binder was used Catalyst C which was merely steamed but not acid extracted, the Days to Methanol Breakthrough increased to 19. When an alumina binder Catalyst D was used which was steamed but not acid extracted, the Days to Methanol Breakthrough increased to 20. Catalyst E represents the catalyst prepared in accordance with this invention Example . It had the longest Days to Methanol Breakthrough 33 , i.e., the greatest stability. A catalyst which has an alumina binder cannot be subjected to acid extraction since the acid would remove the alumina. Therefore, it is not possible to prepare an alumina bound ZSM 5 which has been both steamed and acid extracted since the acid would attack the alumina. The above table also clearly shows that coke on feed was the lowest for the catalyst prepared in accordance with the process of this invention Catalyst E . The catalyst of the present invention, characterized by a steamed and acid extracted composite of relatively inert binder, and a shape selective zeolite with a high silica alumina ratio, may also be used in other hydrocarbon conversion processes. The catalyst should be especially useful in catalytic cracking processes such as fluidized catalytic cracking FCC and Thermofor catalytic cracking TCC a moving bed analog of the FCC process. The catalyst may also be used in catalytic hydrodewaxing processes, though usually a conventional hydrogenation dehydrogenation component will be added.
