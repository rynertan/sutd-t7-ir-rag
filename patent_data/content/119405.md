# Surgical instrument for cutting fragments of cartilage and other tissue.

## Abstract
Cutting suctioning instrument having an elongated sup port 10 and first 4 and second 2 opposed distal jaws, at least one of which 2 is pivotable about a transverse axis x and adapted to be closed by an actuator, and a suction throat defined between proximal portions of the two jaws. Preferably, a sliding inner tube 8 , which defines the suc tion passage, serves as actuator to move the pivotable jaw. As a cutter for meniscal cartilage, a hollow tube 8 defining a tissue fragment transport, suction passage is arranged to communicate through the open throat with the region be tween the jaws to receive cut tissue while suction is asso ciated with the proximal end of the instrument for enabling tissue to be drawn from between the jaws, through the throat and thence through the transport passage while the instru ment remains in situ for repeated cutting. Preferred embodi ments of the instrument are especially useful in arthro scopic surgery.
