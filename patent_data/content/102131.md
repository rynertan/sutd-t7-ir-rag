# A process for conditioning a gas stream charged with solid particles and or vapours.

## Abstract
A process for conditioning a gas charged with solid particles and or vapours, which comprises passing the gas stream through a conditioning tower, spray injecting therein water into the gas to form fine droplets which are allowed to completely evaporate out of contact with the wall, and discharging the cooled and wetted gas from the conditioning tower. According to the invention, the water is sprayed with known per se nozzles which at a reduced water supply give a droplet size less than, or equal to, that at a larger water supply, and the supply of which is variable over a wide range, and the water supply is controlled so that, upon modification of the inlet temperature T₁ and or the amount of gas, on the one hand, the water supplied is completely evaporated within the conditioning tower and, on the other hand, the outlet temperature T₂ of the gas always remains above the known dew point line of the gas.
