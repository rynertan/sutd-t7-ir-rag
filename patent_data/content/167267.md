# Process and system for compression release engine retarding.

## Abstract
Process and apparatus for the compression release retarding of a multi cylinder four cycle internal combustion engine are provided. The process provides a compression release event for each cylinder during each revolution of the engine crank shaft. In accordance with the process, the normal motion of the exhaust and intake valves is inhibited and the exhaust valves are opened briefly at each time the engine piston approaches the top dead center position. The intake valves are opened after each opening of the exhaust valves. The apparatus includes hydraulic means driven by the engine pust tubes which produce a timed hydraulic pulse adapted to open the exhaust and intake valves at the proper time. Hydraulically actuated means are provided to disable the valv crosshead or rocker arm so as to inhibit the normal motion of the valves. Alternatively, timed signals from an electronic controller actuate solenoid valves to control an hydraulic pulse which opens the valves. Solenoid means may also be provided to open the valves mechanic ally.
