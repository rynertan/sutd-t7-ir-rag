## Description
METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF NEUTRAL PROTEASEThe present invention relates to the field of molecular biology and, in particular, to the construction by genetic engineering techniques, of strains which produce large quantities of proteins.More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for the production of the exoenzyme neutral protease, comprising the construction of a hybrid recombinant plasmid containing the gene which codes for the neutral protease, the preparation of a mutant strain of Bacillus subtilis, the introduction of the hybrid recombinant plasmid into the mutant strain, the isolation of clones containing the hybrid recombinant plasmid, the growth of the clones in a liquid culture medium under aerobic conditions and, finally, the isolation of the neutral protease from the culture medium.It is own the use of neutral protease of bacterial origin in industrial fields such as, for example, the food and chemical industries and particularly in the composition of detergerts. It is also know how to produce these enzymes by fermentation processes which include the growth, in a suitable culture medium, of microorganisms which nturEly contain the gene that codes for the enzyme. Among the microorganisms which produce proteolytic enzymes, those belonging to the 0villus genus are of particular interest.These known,processes are somewhat onerous due to the number of stages required and, above all, the poor overall production yields. With the advent. of recombinant DNA technology, it is now possible to construct microorganisms which produce large quantities of proteins. I In accordance with U.S. Patent 4237224, a gene which codes for a particular protein is isolated from a donor strain and introduced into a suitable host cell with the use of special DNA molecules called vectors.The vector molecules used in genetic engineering experiments are able to replicate autonomously in the host cell so that there are generally between 30 and 50 copies present in the end.It follows that, when an exogenous gene is inserted in the vector and the modified vector, the so called hybrid recombinant plasmid, is introduced into the host cell, the number of copies of the gene in the cell is equal to that of the vector.This results in a higher synthesis of the cloned product by the phenomenon known as gene dosage .As is known, DNA is transcribed in the cell by the enzyme RNA polymerase into messenger RNA and this, in its turn, is translated into protein b the coordinated action of the ribosomes and a vast series of enzymes and cell products.Given the high efficiency of the transcriptìonana translation system of the cell if the number of copies of a particular gene is increased, the production of its genetic product is consequently also increased. Accor,dingly, the subject of the invention is a method for the production of neutral protease which comprises a constructing a hybrid recombinant plasmid containing the gene for the neutral protease, b preparing a mutant strain of Bacillus subtilis, c introducing the hybrid recombinant plasmid into the mutant strain, d isolating the clones containing the hybrid plasmid, e cultivating the clones in a liquid culture medium under aerobic conditions, f isolating the neutral protease thus obtained from the culture medium.According to the present invention,hybrid recombinant plasmids are prepared by known methods with the use ofDNA from a donor microorganism present in nature, which contains the gene which codes for the neutral protease.In accordance with the present invention, the construction of the hybrid recombinant plasmids comprises 1. isolating and purifying the chromosomal DNA from the donor microorganism, 2. partially cutting the DNA with a restriction enzyme, 3. isolating the fragments of chromosomal DNA having dimensions between 1.5 and 4 x 103 base pairs, 4. cutting a plasmid with a restriction enzyme which generates cohesive ends the same as those of the DNA fragments, 5. ligase reaction of the fragments obtained in 3 and the linear DNA of the plasmid.Donor microorganisms suitable for the purpose are those belonging to the Bacillus genus. Of these, the preferred bacilli are selected from the group Bacillus subtilxs B.. subtilis .The strain particularly preferred is B. subtilis BGSC 1A341 obtained from the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center,Ohio, U.S.A. which contains the gene which codes for the neutral protease in its chromosome.The chromosomal DNA of this strain is isolated and purified by one of the known methods.The DNA obtained is then partially digested with a specific restriction enzyme.The restriction enzyme MboI is particularly suitable.The partial digestion of the chromosomal DNA generates fragments vf different sizes. From these, fragments having dimensions of between 1.5 and 4 x 103 base pairs which contain the gene under consideration are isolated by means of a sucrose gradient. Any vector which is compatible with the host microorganism may be used to construct the hybrid recombinant plasmids of the present invention.These plasmids are easily identifiable if the vector has a marker. vectors which contain a marker comprising resistance to an antibiotic are particularly suitable. Of these vectors, those preferred are plasmids originally isolated from Staphilococcus aureus and, of these, the plasmid pUB 110 BGSC 1E6 which contains the gene which gives resistance to Kanamycin.The Faid plasmid is cut by known methods by the restriction enzyme BamHI, which generates cohesive ends the same as those generated by the enzyme Mbol and which can thus be linked together. In accordance with the present invention, the stage 5 ligase reaction between the DNt fragments of predetermined dimensions and the linearised plasmid pUB 110 is carried out by known methods in the presence of a ligase enzyme. A ligase which is suitable for this purpose is T4 DNA ligase . which is commercially available. The reaction being carried out .under the conditions indicated above, hybrid recombinant plasmids are obtained which are subsequently used to transform host cells of a suitable microorganism.In accordance with the present invention it has been found that the host cells which are particularly suitable for this purpose are those obtained by mutation of the strain B. subtilis BGSC 1A341. The mutant obtained by us, and indicated SMS 108, has two basic characteristics 1 presence of a mutation in the structural gene for the neutral protease located in the cell genome.2 presence of a recE4 mutation which prevents homologous recombination in B. subtilis.The presence of a mutation in the structural gene for the neutral protease results in a neutral protein se minus genotype npr which facilitates the identification of the strains, when they are transformed by recombinant hybrid plasmids containing the gene which codes the neutral protease.In the cloying of a chromosomal gene of a microorganism, one of the techniques used is that known as the shot gun technique . This technique consists in the cutting of the chromosomal DNA with a restriction enzyme and the linking of the fragments obtained, by means of the enzyme T4 DNA ligase, to a vector plasmid in its turn cut by a suitable restriction enzyme. When carried out in this manner, it is possible to obtain a very large series of hybrid molecules constituted by the plasmid DNA and one or more fragments of the chromosomal DNA.The said molecules are isolated by insertion in host cells. The insertion may be achieved by bringing the hybrid plasmids into contact with microbe cells, the said host cells, by one of the known methods. The plasmid DNA passes through the cell wall and membrane into the cytoplasm where it can become functional. In such a case the cell is said to be transformed. The plasmid transformation has a low efficiency and, on average, only one recombinant hybrid plasmid becomes functional in a single cell.This permits the obtaining of a population of cells which carry single recombinant hybrid plasmids and which are able to generate colonies on a soli d medium. The identification of the colony containing the gene of interest is the simpler, the more efficient and rapid the selection test.In particular, in order to facilitate the identification of the transformed colonies which contain a hybrid recombinant plasmid containing the functional gene for the neutral protease, it is thought to be advantageous to use a mutant strain of B.subtilis lA3il, which is no longer able to produce the neutral protease because of a mutation in its structural gene. The colonies of this mutant strain, grown on a solid medium containing casein in addition to, the substances necessary for bacterial growth, do not generate the typical halo whichìs visible, on the other hand, around colonies of the parental strain BGSC 1A341. The lack of caseinolytic activity in the mutant strain is linked to the functional lack of the gene which codes for the neutral protease.In accordance with the present invention, when these mutant cells are used in the transformation processes, the presence in them of the hybrid recombinant plasmid containing the gene which codes for the neutral protease is made evident on the solid medium, containing case in, by the appearance of a halo around the colony. The mutation of the parental strain B. subtilis BGSC 1A341 may be achieved by treatm commat nt with any one of the mutagenic agents known in the art.In particular N methyl N nitro N nitrosoguanidine may be used.The tteatment with the said compound is carried out in a buffer solution pH 6.0 , at a temperature of 37 C for a period of about 30 minutes. The gene mutation responsible for the neutral protease minus phenotype is then transferred by transformation into cells of B.subtilis SMS 003, characterised by the markers his, leu, met, thus obtaining a mutant strain his leu, met, npr . The strain B. subtilis SMS 003 has been deposited at the Federal Research Collection, NorthCentral Region, Northern Regional Research Center, Peofia Illinois on September 4, 1984 under the number NNRL B 15897. In accordance with the present invention, the mutant strain npr is further modified by the introduction of a recE4 mutation which prevents homologous recombination in B. subtilis. When exogenous DNA is introduced into cells of B. subtilis, if it has regions homologous with the chromosomal DNA, it is subject to recombination in the presence of the product of the recE gene.This recombination causes the insertion of the exogenous DNA fragment into the cell genome.If the homologous DNA fragment is inserted in a plasmid used to transform cells of B. subtilis recE , the plasmid may loose the said fragment by recombination.If, however, the function of the rec E gene is destroyed in a host cell, the homologous DNA may be maintained on the molecule of the hybrid plasmid and thus remain separated from the chromosomal DNA. In accordance with this and according to the present invention, it has been found extremely advantageous to introduce a recE4 mutation which prevents homologous recombination in the mutant strain SMS003 nprThe recE4 mutation is isolated by known methods from the chromosomal DNA of the strain B. subtilis BGSC 1A46 and is subsequently introduced into the mutant strainSMS003 by transformation.The strain obtained, characterised by his, leu, met, recE4, npr markers and indicated SMS108 by us has been deposited at tZeFesseral Research Collection, NorthCentral Region, Northern Regional Research Center, Peoria Illinois on September 4, 1984 under the number SNRL B 15898. According to the present invention, in stage c , the hybrid recombinant plasmids obtained as described above are introduced intd cells of B. subtilis SMS108, rendered competent by the method described by S.Contente and D. Dubnau in Mol.Gen.Genet. 167, 1979 251 258.The clones carrying the gene for the neutral protease are selected on plates containing a suitable culture medium to which knamycin and casein have been added.By this method one can obtain only those cel s which contain the hybrid recombinant plasmid with the determinant for resistance to kanamycin and, from these, one can easily isolate those containing the gene for the neutral protease, identifiable by the presence of a halo Figure 1 . The hybrid recombinant plasmids which contain the gene for the neutral protease are then isolated from two clones surrounded by halos. The said plasmids, indicated pSM 126 and pSM 127 give the restriction maps given in Figure 2. The cells from which the said plasmids, indicated B.subtilis SMS 108 pSM 126 and B. subtilis SMS 108 pSM 127 , were isolated have been deposited at the FederaResearch Collection, North Central Region, NorthernRegional Research Center Peoria Illinois .on September 4, 1984 under the number NfRL B 15899 and NNRL B 15900, respectively.Cells of B. subtilis SMS 1C8 pSM 126 and B. subtilisSMS a pSM 127 are then grown under aerobic conditions in a liquid culture medium in the presence of carbon sources, nitrogen sources and mineral salts, at a temperature of 370C until the neutral protease is obtained in high yields in the culture. medium. Suitable carbon sources which may be used in the culture medium may be of any type of assimilable molecule.The nitrogen compounds are generally chosen from organic and inorganic ammonium salts such as ammonium sulphate, ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate, ammonium acetate, ammonium succinate and urea. Suitable inorganic salts for the purpose include potassium phosphate, sodium phosphate, magnesium sulphate, calcium carbonate, ferrous sulphate, manganese sulphate, zinc sulphate.These salts are used in quantities commonly used in the usual fermentation processes. According to the present invention the medium used is preferably VY veal infusion broth DIFCO , to which yeast extract DIFCO has been added.At the end of the fermentation reaction, the cells are removed from the reaction environment by filtration or centrifugation.and the neutral protease produced is determined in the supernatant liquid by measurement of the enzyme activity, according to the method of H. Vneara et al J. Bacteriol, 119, 82 91, 1971 . The values obtained for the strain B. subtilis SMS108 pSMl26 and B. subtilis SMSlO8 pSM127 , expressed as units ml, are 1895 and 2097 respectively.Analysis of an aliquot of the supernatant liquid on a gel of sodium dodecyl sulphate SDS polyacrylamide by the method of Laemnli U.K. Nature 277, 680 1970 shows, for both strains, the presence of a protein having a molecular weight MW 39,000 identical to that of the neutral protease produced by B. subtilis BGSC1A341.In accordance with the present invention the nucleotide sequence of the gene which codes for the neutral protease was determined.The analysis was carried out by the insertion of restriction fragments A, B and C Figure 2 of the gene for the neutral protease present in.the plasmid pSM127 in the vectors M13mp8 and M13mp9 obtained from NewEngland Nuclear and sequenced by the method of F.Sanger et al PNAS 74, 5463 5467, 1977 and according to the strategy of M. Poncz et al PNAS 79, 4298 4302, 1982 .P. Mantsala and H. Zalkin, in J. Bocteriol, 14. 493 501 1980 , reported the terminal amino sequence of the first 16 aminoacids of the extracellular neutral protease of B. subtilis Ala Ala Ala Thr Gly Ser Gly Thr Thr Leu Lys Gly Ala Thr Val Pro, From a comparison of this data from the literature with the nucleotide sequence which we have determined and which is given inFigure 3, it may be seen that the sequence of 16 aminoacids in the neutral protease is present in the protein derived .from the DNA, starting from the aminoacid residue 222. This implies that the which we have cloned and which is expressed with a high efficiency in 3. subtilis SMS108 is that for the neutral protease. This enzyme is synthesised by B.subtilis SMS108 in the form of a precursor and subsequently is cut at the 221 222 position to give the mature protease. Descfiption of the drawings Figure 1 shows a plate containing casein DIFCO on which colonies which produce neutral pro tease are seen surrounded by halos and those which do not produce the enzyme are free from halos.Figure 2 shows the restriction maps of the hybrid recombinant plasmids pSM126 and pSM127.Figure 3 is the nucleotide sequence of the gene which codes for the neutral protease. The broken line indicates the sequence of the 16 amino terminal aminoacids of the extra cellular neutral protease.The examples below are illustrative and non limiting of the invention.Example 1Preparation of the mutant strain B. subtilis SMS108 Cells of Bacillus subtilis BGSC 1A341 which produce neutral protease are cultivated for one night at 370C with vigorous agitation in 100 ml of VY culture medium previously sterilised at 1200 for 15 minutes and having the following composition DIFCO Veal Infusion broth 25 g lDIFCO Yeast Extract 5 g lH2O 1 1The culture obtained is diluted 1 100 with VY culture medium and grown under vigorous agitation at 37 C. The growth is followed by measurement of the optical density O.D. with a spectro photometer Perkin Elmer model 551 S at 650 nm in a 1 ml cell with a 1 cm optical path. At an O.D. 650 value of 0.7, or about 0.7, l0 ml of the culture are centrifuged for 20 minutes at 5,000 rpm in a Beckman model 4226 centrifuge. The cells are then washed with 5 ml ofTris maleate TM buffer having the following composition per litre Tris 0.05 M maleic acid 0.05 M NH4 2 SO4 lg Mg SO4 . 7H40 0.1 gCa NO3 2 0.25 mg Fe S04 7H20 7N20 0.25 mg pH 6.0 and then resuspended in 10 ml of TM buffer containing 300flg ml of N methyl N nitro N nitrosoguanidine. The suspension is kept under agitation at 370C for 30 minutes. At the end of the reaction, the suspension is centrifuged and the cells washed with 5 ml of TM buffer and resuspended in 50 ml of VY culture medium.The suspension is then divided into 50 aliquots of l ml each, and each aliquot is grown for one night at 370C under agitation. 200 A 1 of sterile glycerol are then added to each aliquot and after freezing in a dry iWe ethanol bath, they are kept at 80 C. In order to isolate the mutants, the various aliquots are brought to a temperature of 37 and then diluted suitably with Spizizen mineral medium and 0.1 ml of each dilution is plated on plaves of medium having the following composition per litre DIFCO nutrient broth 8g Mg SO4 . 7H20 0.25 g , K C1 1 g ,DIFCO Agar 15 gFe SO4 . 7H2O 0.28 gMn C12 1.25 mgCa NO3 2 164 mgCasein 10 gH20 11The plates are incubated at 480C for one night and then the colonies which are not surrounded by a halo are selected. Of about 13,000 colonies selected, only 10 are found to be negative neutral protease mutants.One of these mutants was termed SMS104. The gene mutation responsible for the neutral protease phenotype is then transferred, by transformation into competent cells of the strain B. subtilis SMS003 isolated in our laboratory.The chromosomal DNA of the strain SMS104, isolated by known methods and as described in example 2, is added to cells of the strain SMS003 rendered competent at a concentration of 1 tg ml. Suitable dilutions of the transformation mixture are then plated on casein plates. After a period of incubation of one night at 370C, one colony of the 500 obtained is not surrounded by a halo of caseinolytic activity. The mutation RecE4 is introduced into this clone, termed SMS107. The chromosomal DNA of B.subtilis BGSC 1A46 TrpC2, recE4,Thr 5 is extracted and purified by known methods and used, at a concentration of 1 tg ml to transform competent cells of SMS107. The transformation mixture is then plated on minimum medium Spizizen minimal medium supplemented with 50 pug ml of histidine and leucine. Thus the cells of SMS107 capable of growing on a medium without methionine are selected.The Met colonies are then transferred to plates ofSpizizen medium containing 1QOrg ml of methylmethane sulphonate. The colonies sensitive to this product are those which have the mutation RecE4. One of these colonies is isolated and termed SMSlO8. Example 2Isolation and purification of the chromosomal DNA of the strain B. subtilis BGSC lA341 One litre of VY liquid medium in a 3 litre Erlenmeyer flask is innoculated with 10 ml of a 16 hour culture ofB. subtilis BGSC lA341. The suspension is kept at a temperature of 370C under vigorous agitation.The growth is followed by measurement of the opti,oal density O.D. with a Perkin Elmer, model 551S spectrophotometer at 650 nm in a 1 ml cell with a 1 cm op ical path. At an OD6g0 value of 1, the culture is centrifuged for 20 minutes at 5,000 rpm in a Sorvall centrifuge with a modes GS3 rotor. The cells are then resuspended in 10 ml of a solution of 0.1 M ethylenediamine tetracetic acid EDTA and 0.05 M Nail, pH 6.9. 1 ml of a solution containing 0,1 M EDTA, T.05 M NaCl, pH 6.9 and 10 mg ml of lysozyme obtained from Boehringer Manheim are subsequently added to the suspension.The suspension is kept at 370C for 30 minutes under agitation. At the end of this period, 1 ml of a 10t solution of sodium dodecyl sulphate is added and the suspension is kept at a temperature of 650C for 10 minutes. To the solution obtained there is then added pronase obtained from Boehringer Manheim previously incubated at 370C for 30 minutes in a solution SSC containing 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate, up to a final concentration of 1 mg ml.The solution is kept at 370C until it has clarified completely and. then NaC1 is added up to a final concentration of 1 M.The precipitated DNA is collected on a glass rod and suspended in a 100 ml beaker containing 3 volumes of cold ethanol. The DNA is subsequently resuspended in 10 ml of SSC 0.1 X and the suspension is kept under mild agitation at room temperature 200 to 250C for one night. At the end of this period, pancreatic RNAse 10 g ml and RNAse Tl 5, units ml are added and the mixture incubated at 370C for 30 minutes.The proteins present in the mixture are removed by two successive extractions with equal volumes of phenol saturated with SSC and the solution containing the DNA is dialysed against SSC buffer.The high molecular weight DNA chromosomal DNA isthen purified by the addition of a 1 10 volume of 3 M H3COONH4, lmM EDTA pH 7.5 and 0.54 volumes of isopropanol. The DNA thus obtained is recovered and rcsuspended in SSC buffer, to a final conpentration of 1 mg ml, and kept at 40C.Example 3Partial digestion of the chromosomal DNA with MboI and its fractionation 100 g of chromosomal DNA obtained as described inExample 2 are suspended in 1 ml of a 6n solution ofTris HCl pH7.4, 100 mM NaCl and 6 mb MgC12 in the presence of 100 units of the enzyme MboI BRL .The reaction is carried out at a temperature of 37 C for 30 minutes and then blocked, the temperature being kept at 650C for 10 minutes. The solution obtained, containing the partially digested DNA, is divided into three aliquots and then stratifiec on preformed 10 40E sucrose gradients in the presence of30 mix Tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane hydrochloride Tris HCl , pH 8.1 , 10 mM EDTA, 1MNACl and centrifuged for 20 hours at 25.000 rpm in aBeckmann model 5W 27 centrifuge.2 ml fractions containing fragments of chromosomalDNA of different dimensions are collected. An aliquot of each fraction is analysed on agarose gel with the use of suitable molecular weight standards to determine the dimensions of the DNA fragments present in the individual fractions.The fractions containing DNA fragments having dimensions of between 1.5 and 4 x 10 base pairs bp are combined and diluted with an equal volume of water. To this solution are added two ,volumes of ethanol. The solution is kept in a dry ice ethanol bath T 80 C for 15 minutes. The precipitated DNA is then separated from. the mixture by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm.The DNA obtained is washed with 70 ethanol and dried under vacuum.Example 4Construction of hybrid plasmids containinc the gene for the neutral protease 5 g of the plasmid pUB110 BGSC 1E6 containing the determinant for resistance to kanamycin are linearised in 50 rl of a solution containing 6 m.M Tris HC1, pR7.4, 300 ml NaO1 and e mM MgCl2, with 5 units U of the restriction enzyme Bam HI provided by BRL at a temperature of 37 C for one hour.5 g of chromosomal DNA fragments with dimensions cf between 1.5 and 4 x 10 b.p., obtained as described inExample 3, and 5 g of pUB110 linearised as described above, are mixed in 100 l of a solution containing 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6 , 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM, dithiothreitol and 0.6 mM adenosine triphosphate ATP and linked with the use of 10 U of DNA ligase T4.The ligation mixture is kept at room. temperature 200 to 250C for 3 hours.Example 5 Transformation of cells of B. subtilis SMS108Cells of B. subtilis SMS108 are transformbd by the method of D. Dubnau et al. J. Mol. Biol.56, 20 1, 1971 .20 l of the ligation mixture obtained as explained n Example 4 are used to transform 1 ml of B. subtilisSMS108 cells which have been rendered competent.The transformation mixture is kept at 370C for C minutes and subsequently spread on plates containing casein medium the composition of which is giverExample 1.The plates are incubated at 37 C for 16 hours. At end of this period colonies appear several of which a surrounded by halos. These are the colonies oi subtilis SMS108 containing the hybrid plasmid with t determinant for resistance to kanamycin and the gene for the extracellular neutral protease which caused enzymatic hydrolysis of the casein present.Of 130,0 transformants, 12 appear surrounded by a halo of caseinolytic activity,Example 6Isolation and characterisation of the hybrid plasmids containing the qene which codes for the neutral proteaseFrom two transformants having caseinolytic activity obtained as in Example 5, the hybrid plasmids pSMl26 and pSMl27, whose restriction maps are given InFigure 2, are isolated by the method described by Gryczan et al J. Bacteriology 134 313, 329 1978 .These plasmids have a common zone of DNA of about 2400 base pairs bp . The plasmids thus isolated are reintroduced separately into competent cells of the strain B. subtilis SMSlO8. The transformation mixtures, after growth at 370C for 30 minutes, are spread on plates containing a casein medium having the composition described previously.After a period of 16 hours at a temperature of 37 C, all the transformants resistant to kanamycin appear surrounded by a halo of proteolytic activity.This demonstrates presence on the two hybrid plasmids pSM126 and pSM127 of the gene which codes for an extracellular protease.In the same experiment, cells of B. subtilis SMSlO8 are transformed by the plasmid pUB110, containing the determinant for resistance t6 kanamycin.The transformed cells, spread on plates containing casein in the medium do not, after 16 hours at 37 CC, give rise to any halo formation. This shows that these transformants are free from genes codifying for caseinolytic activity. Example 7Production and characterisation of the proteolytic activity of the strain B. subtilis SMS108 pSM126 and B. subtilis SMS108 pSMl27 Four 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 10 ml of VY medium, to the first 3 of which 5 g ml of kanamyrin have been added, are innoculated respectively with tR e following strains B. subtilis SMS108 pSM126 , h. subtilis SMSlO8 pSMl27 , SMS108 pUBll0 and B.subtilis BGSC 1A341. The flasks are kept at a temperature of 37 C for 24 hours under vigorous agitation.At the end of this period, the cells are removed from the culture media by centrifuging and the supernatant liquids are dialysed at 40C for 24 hours against lQ r. Tris HCl pH 7.5 buffer containing 2 m canclurn acetate.100 l of each supernatant liquid are then suitably diluted with 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 buffer containing 2mM calcium acetate and mixed with 0.5 ml of a 0.65 casein solution Merck in 50 mM Tris HCl buffer, in order to determine the activity of the enzyme produced by each strain in the culture broth. The mixtures are incubated at a temperature of 37 C for 30 minutes. The non hydrolysed casein is then precipitated by the addition of 0.5 ml of a solution containing 0.llM trichloracetic acid, 0.33M acetic acid and 0.22M sodium acetate at room temperature 20 C to 25 C for 30 minutes.At the end of this period, the precipitate is separated by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes and the absorbance of the supernatant liquid is measured at a wavelength of 275nm, with the use of a Perkin Elmer model 551S spectrophotometer. A protease unit is defined as the quantity of enzyme which, in one minute at 370C, under the, conditions described above, causes an increase in absorbance at 275 nm equivalent to 1 g of tyrosine.The characterisation of the protease produced by the individual strains was effected by determining separately the activity of the neutral protease and of the serine protease present in the same solution.The first is inhibited by pre incubation of the supernatant liquid for one hour at 0 C in the presence of 5 mM EDTA the second is inhibited by maintaining the supernatant liquid at 0 C for one hour in the presence of 1 nhi phenylmethylsuiphonyl fluoride PSMF . The results obtained from the analysis of the supernatant liquids for the various strains are given inTable 1.

In the presence of high quantities of neutral protease it is not possible to determine the activity due to the serine protease.From the data given in Table I it is seen that the strains of the present invention produce a neutral protease with a yield 5 6 times greater than the original strain
