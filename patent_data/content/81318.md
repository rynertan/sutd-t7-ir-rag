# A cast metal composite component.

## Abstract
A component 10,12 , for moulding glassware, is produced by forming a first mould 10 , for moulding a first metal, placing an insert 12 or inserts 12 of a second, reinforcing metal within the first mould 10 , casting the first metal in the first mould about the insert 12 or inserts 12 , and machining the casting to the desired final shape. The first metal may be cast iron, and the second metal may be a nickel cobalt alloy. The first moulds are designed so that the flow path of the first molten metal does not impinge directly on the second metal whereby the insert 12 is prevented from being prematurely melted.
