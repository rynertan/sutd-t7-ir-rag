# Apparatus and method for serial dilution of liquid samples.

## Abstract
An apparatus for serial dilution of liquid samples comprises a power driven measuring valve 11 having a rotatably mounted valve body 23 provided with a single calibrated measuring passageway 35 . During a dilution cycle the measuring passageway 35 in different rotational positions of the valve body 23 successively isolates a measured volume of a sample to be diluted and an equal volume of a first diluted solution of the sample which has been prepared by mixing the isolated undiluted volume of the sample with a measured volume of diluent. In a valve body position between said different rotational positions the measuring passageway 35 is connected to form part of a rinsing flow system 56,58 .
