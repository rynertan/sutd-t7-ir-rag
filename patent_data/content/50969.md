## Description
ALLOY STEEL POWDER The present invention provides a corrosion resistant alloy steel powder and a method of producing final products using the same. More specifically, the alloy powder is a modification of a type 300 series stainless steel, with increased percentages of silicon and phosphorus. The alloy powder is useful for producing fully dense metal products by powder metallurgy techniques. Type 300 series stainless steels are common stainless steels used in numerous industrial applications.In attempting to make fully dense products from the atomized powder of the alloys of this type of stainless steel using powder metallurgy techniques, it is known that powder alloys of the typical compositions of the alloy series, i.e. type 304 and type 316, are difficult to sinter to full density. It is believed that the difficulty in sintering is due to the narrow difference between the solidus and liquidus temperatures of these alloys. This difference is approximately 10FO 50C . Accordingly, the width of the liquid phase sintering range of such an alloy would be so narrow that it would be economically impractical to control the sintering temperature accurately enough in a commercial production operation. Accordingly, it is necessary to increase the difference between the liquidus and solidus temperatures in order that liquid phase sintering can be commercially performed. The present invention provides a high alloy steel powder useful in forming fully dense, corrosion resistant products by powder metallurgy techniques.A method of producing final products from the steel powder is also provided. In the method of producing the alloy powder of the present invention, the typical composition of the type 300 series stainless steel is changed to provide additional silicon and phosphorus. Thus the invention provides an alloy steel powder containing, by weight 16 19 chromium, 12 138 nickel, up to 2 manganese, up to 4 molybdenum, up to 0.2 carbon, 1.7 3.08 silicon and 0.04 0.24 phosphorus, the balance being essentially iron. The difference between the solidus and liquidus temperatures is increased to greater than 250F 140C by the addition of the silicon andphosphorus, and sintering can be commercially performed within the temperature range. The additional silicon is usually added in a pre alloy operation prior to atomization of the molten alloy to form a powder. The phosphorus can be added in the pre alloy operation, but can also be added in an ad mix operation. In such an ad mix operation, the phosphorus is added in powder form to the alloy powder, usually in the form of ferro phosphorus powder. The nickel content of the alloys is preferably about 12 . The silicon content may for example be 2 3 and is preferably about 3 . The phosphorus content is preferably 0.08 0.1 . The maximum carbon content of the alloys is typically about 0.1 , and if desired carbon, manganese and molybdenum can be absent from the compositions.
