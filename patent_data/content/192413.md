# COLOUR TELEVISION RECEIVERS

## Abstract
In a television receiver, a colour picture tube 16 for displaying a colour picture has a signal supply that includes a plurality of primary colour signal channels for supplying a plurality of primary colour signals to the tube 16 and current detecting means 26 connected to the signal supply so as to detect currents flowing through the tube 16 and an automatic white balance circuit 23, 24, 8, 10 for controlling the signal supply in response to the detected currents detected by the current detecting means 26 . A power responsive circuit 321 generates a control signal when a power switch for the television receiver is turned on and a blanking circuit 22 connected to the signal supply inhibits the supply of primary colour signals to the tube 16 . A first circuit 322 connected to the power responsive circuit 321 actuates the blanking circuit 22 when the power switch is turned on, and a second circuit 323 connected to the current detecting mens 321 deactuates the blanking circuit 22 when the current which flows through the tube 16 exceeds a predetermined value.
