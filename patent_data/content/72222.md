# Method and apparatus for analyzing the hydrocarbon components of a gas sample by measuring laser beam absorption.

## Abstract
Beams 11 and 13 produced by helium neon gas lasers 10 and 12 are directed at photoacoustic absorption cells 20 and 21 containing a flowing sample gas stream re covered from coal, oil and natural gas well drilling. The com mon hydrocarbon gases and vapors within cell 20 highly ab sorb the infrared energy emitted by laser 10 thereof produ cing an acoustic disturbance which is detected by a transdu cer 34 which produces an electrical output signal proportion al to the concentration of the hydrocarbon gases and vapors. The methane gas within cell 21 weakly absorbs the infrared energy of laser beam 13 , and thus the resulting output signal produced by a transducer 35 serves as a reference signal for determining the methane concentration. The output signals from transducers 34 and 35 are used by data processing unit 40 to compute the total concentration of hydrocarbon gases and vapors and the concentration of methane gas within cells 20 and 21 . A turnable carbon dioxide gas laser 44 produces laser beams 45 and 47 both in the infrared region which are highly absorbed by the propane and n butane com ponent gases, respectively, flowing through photoacoustic cell 48 . The level of energy absorbed from these two beams as determined by the energy of the acoustic disturbance pro duced within cell 48 , induces production of an electrical out put signal by transducer 56 at levels proportional to the con centrations of the propane and n butane gases in cell 48 . The output signals from transducer 56 are then used by data pro cessing unit 40 to compute the concentrations of propane, n butane gases and C 5 gases in the sample.
