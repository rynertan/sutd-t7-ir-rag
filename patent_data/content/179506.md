# Method of drape drawing a shadow mask for a colour display tube and device for such a method.

## Abstract
A shadow mask sheet for a colour display tube consist ing of a nickel iron alloy is drape drawn by means of a drawing process. Prior to the drawing process the shadow mask sheet is subjected to an annealing treatment between 700 and 820 C so as to produce complete recrystallisation without grain growth of any significance. During the drawing process the shadow mask sheet is maintained at a temperature between 150 C and 250 C, a 0.2 proof stress of the shadow mask material between 150 and 250 C being reached below a tensile stress of 150
