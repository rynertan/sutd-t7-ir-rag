## Description
A Method bf Preparing Human Prolyl HydroxylaseTechnical FieldThis invention relates to a method of preparing human prolyl hydroxylase EC 1. 14. 11. 2 , an enzyme which plays an important role in the biosynthesis of collagen.Background ArtProlyl hydroxylase, an intercellularly located enzyme in animals and plants, plays an important role in the biosynthesis of collagen Cardinale, G.J. et al 1974 AdvEnzymol 41 245 300 . It was Stein et al who first reported the clinical significance of this enzyme in human serum Stein, H.D. et al 1970 Lancet 1, 106 109 .They measured the activity of this enzyme in human serum essentially utilizing an assay procedure developed byHutton et al Hutton, J.J. et al 1966 Anal Biochem 16 384 394 , but it is very difficult to use this procedure clinically, because it is so laborious and troublesome that large numbers of samples could not be handled in an assay and because a number of investigators failed to detect the activity of this enzyme in serum with this procedure, probably due to the presence of inhibitors in the serum e.g. Takeuchi et al Takeuchi, T. et al 1966 Gastroenterology 56 744 750 . As an alternative to the above, an attempt to measure the concentration of prolyl hydroxylase in serum employing a radioimmunoassay system convenient for measuring large numbers of samples in an assay was successfully made byTuderman et al Tuderman, L. et al 1975 Eur J. Biochem 60 399 405 . Before them, Kuutti et al had developed a procedure for purifying the enzyme from human fetal tissue Kuutti, E R et al 1975 Eur J. Biochem 57 181 188 and Tuderman et al established the above radioimmunoassay utilizing the enzyme purified from human fetal tissue by the method of Kuutti et al and its specific antiserum.In practice, however, it is also very difficult to carry out this radioimmunoassay, because it is not easy to obtain human fetal tissue. It is necessary to prepare the enzyme from human tissue in order to develop a radioimmunoassay system to measure the concentration of this enzyme in human serum, but no attempt has been made to purify this enzyme from any human tissue other than fetal tissue. Furthermore, the clinical significance of determinations of the concentration of this enzyme in human serum has been essentially unknown.In accordance with the present invention, I have established a procedure for purifying this enzyme from human placental tissue a material obtainable in large amounts with greater ease than human fetal tissue and have demonstrated that measuring this enzyme s concentration in human serum with the newly developed radioimmunoassay is useful in diagnosing acute hepatitis and in judging the effectiveness of transcatheter arterial embolization TAE with patients having hepatocellular carcinoma.The purification of prolyl hydroxylase utilizing human placental tissue as a raw material can be carried out by adding gel electrophoresis and electrophoretic extraction to the previous procedure described by Kuutti et al. The initial steps of the purification such as homogenization, ammonium sulfate fractionation, affinity chromatography A on poly L Proline derivatized Sepharose LIB and gel chromatography on a Bio Gel A 1.5m oolumn were almost the same as described by Kuutti et al. However, the enzyme solution thus obtained still contained impurities when examined by gel electrophoresis, and the following steps were necessary to isolate the enzyme to homogeneity.The enzyme solution obtained was electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels according to the method of Davis Davis, B.J. 196to Ann NY Acad Sci 121 404 427 . After the electrophoresis the proteins on the gels were stained with anilinonaphthalene sulfonate and the protein band corresponding to the band previously ascertained to have the activity of the enzyme was cut out under ultraviolet light Hartman, B.K. et al 1969 Anal Biochem 30 391394 . The enzyme was electrophoretically extracted from these gel slices according to the method of Hashizume et al Hashfzume, S. et al 1984 Electrophoresis 5 30 34 and thus the enzyme was purified. With respect to the recovery, there was little difference between the present purification and that described by Kuutti et al.The advantages of the present invention over the known prior art are as follows 1 A procedure is established for purifying prolyl hydroxylase from human placental tissue with additional steps.2 This invention enables one to prepare the enzyme in large quantities, because human placental tissue can be obtained in large amounts relatively easily.3 The inventor has demonstrated that to establish a radioimmunoassay system utilizing the enzyme thus purified and its specific antiserum prepared in animals e.g. rabbits and to measure the concentration of this enzyme in human serum with this radioimmunoassay is clinically useful in diagnosing acute hepatitis and in judging the effectiveness of TAE with patients having hepatocellular carcinoma.Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1A shows a polyacrylamide gel of the enzyme partially purified by the procedure described by Kuutti et al.

Best Mode for Carring Out the InventionI would like to explain the invention by presenting a concrete example All procedures were carried out at 0 40C. Human placental tissue 10.7 Kg was homogenized in a Waring blender with a solution of 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.8 containing 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M glycine, 0.1 Triton X 100 and 10 cm dithiothreitol, using 1 ml solution g of tissue. The hcmogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 30 min and solid ammonium sulfate was slowly stirred into the supernatant fraction 14 i . The protein which precipitated in the fraction of 20 70 saturation of ammonium sulfate was dissolved in a solution 1.7 of 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.8 containing 0.1 MNaCl, 0.1 M glycine and 10 pM dithiothreitol.The sample was dialyzed twice against 20 volumes of a solution containing the same components as above for 12 h. The dialyzate was centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 40 min and 82 ml of poly L proline derivatized Sepharose 4B containing 2.6 mg of poly L proline with molecular weight of 40,000 1 ml gel volume was added to the supernatant fraction. This mixture was stirred batchwise with a slowly rotating screw overnight so that the enzyme was adsorbed to the ligand. The reason why a batch method was used in this step was that in a column method the flow rate of the eluting fluid would be so low that adsorption could not be completed while the enzyme was still active. In this batch method, 80.5 of the enzyme activity was adsorbed onto the ligand. The poly L proline derivatized Sepharose 4B, which had adsorbed the enzyme, was collected on a glass filter and washed with 30 volumes of the same solution as described above. The washed gel was packed into a column 1.86 x 30 cm and eluted with a solution made up of the same solution as described above containing 3 mg ml of poly L proline having molecular weight of 9,000.The fractions having the enzyme activity were collected and concentrated by ultrafiltration in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell with PM 30 membrance down to 25.5 ml.The concentrate was centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 10 min to eliminate insoluble substances and the supernatant fraction was chromatographed on a Bio Gel A 1.5 m column x x 101 cm and the effluent collected on a fraction collector. Enzyme activity and absorbance at 230 nm were determined for each fraction and those fractions having a high ratio of enzyme activity to absorbance at 230 nm were collected and concentrated by ultrafiltration in the above cell to 9.8 ml. When a portion of the concentrate was electrophoresed on a 7 polyacrylamide gel according to the method of Davis, there were two bands as shown in Fig.1A. The majority of the enzyme activity was present in the major band, and the specific activity of the protein in the minor band was lower than that in the major band. Therefore, the above concentrate was electrophoresed on 7 polyacrylamide gels according to the method of Davis and the gels wereEMI6.1 stained with anilinonaphthalene sulfonate according to the method of Hartman et al. The protein band corresponding to the major band in Fig. 1A was cut out under ultraviolet light and the enzyme was electrophoretically extracted from the gel slices employing an apparatus of the type devised by Hashizume et al. In this way the enzyme was purified. When reelectrophoresed, the enzyme showed a single band Fig. 1B . A summary of the purification is shown in Table I.With respect to the recovery, there was little difference between this purification and that described by Kuutti et al.After gel electrophoresis and electrophoretic extraction in this purification, the enzyme activity and its specific activity decreased to 12 and 50k respectively of the values before these steps, but these steps were indispensable in purifying prolyl hydroxylase from human placental tissue.

UsingOuchterlony s double immunodiffusion technique only a single precipitin line was detected between the antiserum and the crude enzyme, which fused with the line of the purified enzyme Fig. 2 . This result shows that the enzyme used for immunization was pure and the antiserum specific.By using this specific antiserum, it is possible 1 to establish a radioimmunoassay system for measuring minute amounts of prolyl hydroxylase and 2 to localize the enzyme in tissue histochemically.In the following paragraphs I would like to show that the development of a radioimmunoassay system using this specific antiserum and 5I labelled enzyme preparation and that the measurement of the concentration of prolyl hydroxylase in human serum with this radioimmunoassay system is useful in clinical medicine. I established a radioimmunoassay based on a two antibody system Morgan, C.R. et al 1963 Diabetes 12 115 126 and measured the concentrations of S IRPH in normal subjects and in patients with various diseases. The results are shown in Fig. 3. The mean value of the concentration ofS IRPH in 33 normal subjects was 253 59 S.D. ng ml with a range of 155 400 ng ml. The mean value of S IRPH in 7 patients with acute hepatitis was 982 f 1,020 S.D. ng ml with a range of 385 3,260 ng ml, which was significantly higher than that in normal subjects P 0.001 .But the mean values of S IRPH in patients witb chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer showed no significant differenXce from that in normal subjects. The elevated values in acute hepatitis are considered to have resulted from the release of the enzyme from the damaged liver cells into the blood.Recently, transcatheter arterial embolization therapy has been popularly performed on patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, in which an arterial catheter is superselectively inserted into the feeding artery of the tumor under fluorography and gelatin sponge particles Spongel ss are infused into the feeding artery through the catheter so that tumorous tissues are led to undergo ischaemic necrosis Yamada, R. et al 1980 Osaka CityMed J 26 81 96 . When the values of S IRPH before and after TAE were compared, they were found to have increased after TAE in all embolizations Fig. 4 . This effect is considered to be due to the release of the enzyme from the damaged tumorous tissue into the blood. The behaviour ofS IRPH values in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma, who received TAE repeatedly, is shown in Fig.5, which also strongly suggests that the embolizations have led the hepatic tissues to undergo necrosis. It will be apparent from the above observations that the determination of the concentration of S IRPH with the newly developed radioimmunoassay is extremely valuable in diagnosing acute hepatitis and in judging the effectiveness of TAE with patients having hepatocellular carcinoma.
