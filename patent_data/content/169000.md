# Microwave ovens and methods of cooking food.

## Abstract
A microwave oven has a magnetron for supplying micro wave power to a cavity of the oven, and an electrical resistance heating element over which air is blown by a fan to provide a forced flow of hot air through the cavity. The variation in hot air temperature is monitored, and the slope of the temperature time variation is sensed after a predetermined time interval from the commencement of cooking with the oven in a cold condition. The sensed slope is used to predict the time at which the hot air temperature will reach a predetermined threshold, and the supplies of microwave power and the hot air are dis continued after the predicted time has elapsed.
