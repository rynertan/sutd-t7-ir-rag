# Ship propeller device movably mounted with respect to the hull.

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with a propeller device for a ship, which device turns through 360 and which can be raised when it is not in use. The transmission system of the said propeller device comprises a drive shaft for the propeller device, which is placed in the upper part of the propeller device, is driven by the shaft of the engine, and from which the movement of rotation is passed via an upper angular gearbox to a vertical shaft and further via a lower angular gearbox to the propeller shaft placed in the bottom part of the propeller device. According to the invention, a coupling is fitted be tween the drive shaft of the propeller device and the engine shaft rotating same, whereat the propeller device can be uncoupled from the engine by means of a coupling member belonging to the said coupling and displaceable in the axial direction, so that the propeller device can be raised.
