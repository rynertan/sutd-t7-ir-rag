# Magnetic head.

## Abstract
A magnetic head for magnetic writing and optical read out has a main pole and an auxiliary pole 16 which are located adjacent a magnetic recording medium 14 . The main pole is formed by first and second magnetic thin films 11,12 , the first 11 of which has a high permeability and the second 12 has a magneto optic effect Faraday effect, Kerr effect . Furthermore, the second film 12 is positioned so as to be capable of being magnetized by the leakage magnetic field from the recording medium 14 and has an easy magnetization axis parallel to its surface. In this way a magnetic head may be produced which has a high magneto optical conversion efficiency, and hence good writing reproduction characteristics.
