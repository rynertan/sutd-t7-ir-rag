## Description
CATALYSTS FOR PARA ETHYLTOLUENE DEHYDROGENATION This invention relates to improved catalysts for the selective dehydrogenation of dialkyl aromatic hydrocarbons to produce alkyl vinyl aromatic hydrocarbons, more particularly to catalysts for the production of para methylstyrene PMS via the dehydrogenation of para ethyltoluene PET . The vinyl benzenes play a particularly important role in the preparation of synthetic plastics and resins. The polymerization of styrenes, for example, to produce polystyrene resins is well known. Styrene and styrene derivatives are typically produced from ethyl benzene materials by dehydrogenation over solid catalysts in the presence of co fed steam, and at temperatures ranging from 5000 to 7000C. The catalysts found to be the most effective for this process are those which are based on potassium oxide carbonate promoted, chromium oxide stabilized, iron oxide material. Catalysts of this type are said to be self regenerative inasmuch as, in addition to their effectiveness in promoting dehydrogenation, they also promote the water gas reaction in the presence of the steam co feed, to thereby remove coke which would otherwise build up on and deactivate the catalyst.The lifetime of such self regenerative catalysts is thus determined by the effectiveness of the catalyst in maintaining its activity for conversion of ethylbenzene materials such as para ethyltoluene for any given steam hydrocarbon ratio in the feed.Catalysts of this type which can maintain such activity at generally lower steam hydrocarbon ratios are, of course, more economically desirable. Considerable research has been directed toward attempts to improve the activity and selectivity of this class of catalysts. For a given steam to hydrocarbon ratio in the feed, any improvement which results in either increasing the selectivity moles of desired product per mole of reactant reacted or the conversion moles of reactant reacted per mole of starting material without lowering the other is economically attractive since the result is that the yield moles of desired product produced per mole of reactant of the product has been increased. Any increase in the numerical value of the yield results in a more efficient operation with more reactant being converted into the desired product. In commercial operations, many of which produce millions of pounds of product per year, a trade off is frequently effected between selectivity and conversion.An increase of only 1 or 2 percentage points in the selectivity can result in a substantial savings of starting materials. An increase in conversion can substantially reduce capital expenditure and energy consumption. The trade off may vary depending on raw materials costs, energy costs, and the age of the plant. Attempts have been made to improve the conversion effectiveness and selectivity of iron oxide type dehydrogenation catalysts for use in various alkylaromatic dehydrogenation reactions.Riesser U.S. Patent 4,152,300 issued May 1, 1979, for example, discloses that an improvement in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation catalyst selectivity can be realized by incorporating small amounts of certain metal oxide materials into dehydrogenation catalyst compositions comprising mixtures of iron oxide, potassium oxide, vanadium oxide and, optionally, chromium oxide. Courty U.S. Patent 4,134,858 issued January 19, 1979, discloses an iron oxide based dehydrogenation catalyst containing particular amounts of clay to improve the conversion, selectivity and yield of styrene and divinylbenzenes produced by dehydrogenation of ethyl or diethylbenzene. Notwithstanding such attempts to improve iron oxide based dehydrogenation catalysts, there is a continuing need to formulate catalysts of this type which can be used to realize improved conversion, selectivity, and or yield in the dehydrogenation of other types of alkylaromatic materials such as, for example, in the production of para methylstyrene from para ethyltoluene. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved iron oxide based dehydrogenation catalyst especially useful for the dehydrogenation of para ethyltoluene to produce para methylstyrene. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a para ethyltoluene dehydrogenation process employing a catalyst which provides a significant increase in para ethyltoluene conversion with little or no corresponding drop in para methylstyrene selectivity. The present invention relates to improved dehydrogenation catalyst compositions especially useful for the selective dehydrogenation of para ethyltoluene to produce para methylstyrene.Such a catalyst comprises from about 30 to 60 by weight of an iron oxide component, calculated as ferric oxide, from about 13 to 48 by weight of a potassium compound component, calculated as potassium oxide, and from 0 to about 5 by weight of a chromium compound component, calculated as chromic oxide. At least 50 by weight of the active iron oxide component is present in the form of particles ranging in size from about 0.05 to 0.5 micron. The present invention also relates to a dehydrogenation process wherein para ethyltoluene, preferably along with steam, is passed over the foregoing catalyst composition at a temperature from about 5000C to 7000C with a LHSV of from about 0.3 to 2.0 hour , to produce para methylstyrene. The dehyrogenation catalyst compositions of the present invention contain as an essential catalytic component one or more iron compounds, generally in the form of iron oxide. Many forms of iron oxide can be used in the catalyst compositions of this invention.Typically, iron oxides employed in catalyst preparations of this sort are a synthetically produced, powdered red, red brown, yellow or black pigment. The red or red brown pigments are highly pure ferric oxide, while the black pigment is the magnetic form, ferrosoferric oxide Fe304 , which is usually found in the catalyst under various reaction conditions. The yellow iron oxides consist of the monohydrated form of ferric oxide. These oxides are prepared by various methods, e.g., oxidation of iron compounds, roasting, precipitation, calcination, etc. A suitable form of iron compound is the monohydrated yellow iron oxide used in the preparation of catalysts according to U.S. Patent Numbers 3,360,597, issued December 26, 1967, and 3,364,277 issued January 16, 1968. Particularly suitable are pigment grade red iron oxides of purities exceeding 98 weight.These red oxides have surface areas ranging from 2 to 50 m2 gram and are commercially available in particle sizes of from 0.1 to 2 microns. The iron compound is present in the catalyst in either one or a mixture of both of its possible oxidation states, i.e., as ferrous iron or ferric iron or mixtures thereof, as for example, ferrosoferric iron. The catalyst compositions herein generally comprise from about 30 to 60 by weight, preferably from about 35 to 55 by weight, of iron oxide calculated as ferric oxide. It has been surprisingly discovered that the size of the iron oxide particles used to formulate the catalyst composites of the present invention can affect the activity and selectivity of the resulting dehydrogenation catalysts. In accordance with the present invention, at least 50 by weight, and preferably at least 90 by weight, of the iron oxide component utilized is in the form of particles of from about 0.05 to 0.5 micron in size, more preferably from about 0.1 to 0.4 micron in size. By maintaining such particle size restrictions on the active iron oxide component, catalysts can be realized which provide unexpectedly high conversion of saturated hydrocarbons such as para ethyltoluene to unsaturated products. With respect to dehydrogenation of para ethyltoluene, such catalysts are also unexpectedly selective to production of para methylstyrene.Improvements in activity and selectivity of such catalysts can thus permit utilization of lower amounts of co fed steam in carrying out the selective dehydrogenation reaction. The dehydrogenation catalyst compositions of the present invention also essentially comprise, as a catalyst promoter, one or more potassium compounds. The potassium promoter material can be added to the catalyst in various forms. For example, it may be added as the oxide, or as other compounds which are convertible, at least in part, under calcination conditions, to the oxides, such as the hydroxides, the carbonates, the bicarbonates, the phosphates, the borates, the acetates, and the like. A particularly preferred potassium compound is potassium carbonate. The potassium compound is generally present in the catalyst as a potassium oxide, a potassium carbonate or a mixture thereof. High carbon dioxide partial pressures in the reaction gases will favor high carbonate to oxide ratios and vice versa within the potassium component. The catalyst compositions herein generally comprise from about 13 to 48 by weight, and preferably from about 27 to 41 by weight, of potassium promoter compound, calculated as potassium oxide. When the potassium compound actually used in formulating the catalyst is the preferred potassium carbonate, the catalyst compositions herein generally can contain from about 20 to 70 by weight, and preferably from about 40 to 60 by weight, of potassium compound, calculated as potassium carbonate. Preferably the molar ratio of potassium compound, as K20 or K2C03, to iron compound, as Fe203, ranges from about 0.8 1 to 1.5 1, more preferably from about 0.9 1 to 1.3 1. An optional, but highly preferred, component of the present catalyst composition is a chromium compound which serves as a stabilizer for the active catalytic components. Chromium compounds have, in fact, typically been added to alkali promoted iron oxide catalysts to extend their life. Chromium, when optionally used in the compositions of this invention, can be added to the catalyst in the form of a chromium oxide or in the form of chromium compounds which decompose upon calcination to chromium oxides, as for example, chromium nitrates, hydroxides, acetates, and the like. Chromium can also be added in the form of alkali metal chromates. If potassium chromates are used, such materials can, of course, also contribute to the requisite concentration of potassium compound essentially present in the dehydrogenation catalyst compositions as hereinbefore discussed.Thus, the catalyst compositions herein can comprise from 0 to about 5 by weight, and preferably from about 2 to 4 by weight chromium compound, calculated as chromic oxide. The physical strength of the catalyst composition of the present invention can be improved, if desired, by adding any of a variety of optional binding agents. Binding agents can include, for example, calcium aluminate and portland cement. The density of the catalyst compositions herein can likewise be modified by the addition of various filler substances, for example, combustible materials such as sawdust, carbon, wood flour, etc. Such materials can be added to the compositions during preparation and thereafter burned out after the catalyst pellets have been formed. Other porosity promoting aids include graphite and aqueous solutions of methylcelluose, which also facilitate extrusion of catalyst pellets as hereinafter described. If employed, binders and other fillers generally can comprise up to about 10 by weight of the catalyst composition. The catalyst compositions of the present invention are in general prepared by admixing the essential and desired optional components as hereinbefore described with water and by thereafter drying and optionally calcining the resulting mixture. Drying temperatures can range from about 500C to 5000C. Calcination temperatures can range from about 3000C to 6500C, preferably from about 4500C to 550OC. The components of the catalyst compositions herein can be admixed in various ways. One method comprises ballmilling together a mixture of the desired oxides and or compounds decomposable upon calcination to oxides, adding a small amount of water, and extruding the paste formed to produce small pellets, which are then dried and calcined. Another method is to dissolve the components together, spray dry these components to form a resulting powder, calcine the powder into the resultant oxides, and then add sufficient water to form a paste which is extruded into pellets, dried and calcined.Another procedure involves precipitating those materials which are precipitatable, such as iron and chromium, as the resultant hydroxides, partially dewatering the resultant precipitate, adding soluble salts of the other required metals, and then subsequently extruding, drying and calcining the resulting pellets. A preferred method involves dry blend powdering of oxides and or compounds decomposable upon calcination to the oxides, adding water, optionally containing dissolved therein soluble compounds decomposable upon calcination to the oxides, then mixing and or mulling the resultant paste, pelletizing the mixture, subsequently substantially drying at a temperature from about 500C to about 3000C, followed by calcining the pellets at a temperature ranging from about 4500C to about 5000C, to form the final product.The drying and calcining could be carried out stepwise in the same furnace by suitable programming of the furnace temperature. Alternatively, water insoluble dry powders of oxides and or compounds decomposable upon calcination to the oxides are dry mixed, and the balance of the other materials needed are dissolved in water and the resultant solution is used to form the paste with the dry powders. There are many variations of the mixing of dry powders, water and water soluble compounds that give equivalent results and fall within the scope of this invention. The optimum size of the pellets produced will vary according to the needs of various processes in which they are to be utilized.Cylindrical catalyst pellets having a diameter of from 1.6 to 4.8 mm 1 16 to 3 16 of an inch , and from 3.2 to 12.7 mm 1 8 to 1 2 of an inch in length are typical. The smaller diameter catalysts are generally more active but provide increased pressure drops. The catalysts of the present invention are especially effective in promoting the dehydrogenation of para ethyltoluene to produce para methylstyrene. Such a dehydrogenation reaction is usually carried out at reaction temperatures of about 5000C 7000C. However, higher or lower temperatures may be used without departing from the scope of this invention. The use of atmospheric, sub atmospheric, or super atmospheric pressure is suitable. However, it is preferable to operate at as low a pressure as is feasible, and atmospheric or sub atmospheric pressure is preferred. The process of the invention may be carried out in batch, semi continuous, or continuous operation, with continuous operation being preferred. The catalyst is employed in the form of a fixed bed, or in fluidized or suspended form. It is preferable to utilize a fixed bed. The reaction may be carried out in single stage reactors or by staging in series reactors. The reactors may be of various designs, e.g., downflow reactors, radial reactors, etc. With the use of the catalyst of this invention, it is desirable to add steam to the reactant feed to aid in the removal of carbonaceous residues from the catalyst. The weight ratio of steam to hydrocarbon in the reactant feed can generally vary from about 1.3 1 to 4 1. Good results can be obtained using steam to hydrocarbon ratios of from about 1.4 1 to 3.5 1. Catalysts having higher potassium contents generally permit utilization of desirably lower steam to hydrocarbon ratios in the reactant feed. The contact time of the reactant gas with the catalyst is usually defined in terms of liquid hourly space velocity volume of liquid hydrocarbon reactant at room temperature per volume of catalyst per hour, i.e., LHSV . The LHSV according to this invention may vary from about 0.3 to 2.0 hours and is preferably adjusted within this range to effect the degree of conversion desired for the particular feed in question. The catalysts of the present invention and their use will be further described by the following examples which are provided for illustration and are not to be construed as limiting the invention.It should be noted that advantages resulting from increases of selectivity and or conversion of only one or two percentage points are extremely significant in a commerical process which may produce many hundreds of thousand pounds of product a day. Catalysts with higher activities, which can result in lower operating temperatures can be significant in lowering costs of plant operations.
