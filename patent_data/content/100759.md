# A method for producing plastic products, and an extruder nozzle for working the method.

## Abstract
In order to homogenize and to obtain a uniform temperature distribution in a plastics substance, which is to be extruded between an inner and an outer component in a nozzle, the substance is made to pass a bearing structure comprising a number of rolling bearings, where the balls serve as kneading bodies. The inner and the outer compo nents of the orifice rotate in opposite directions, which will orientate the molecular chains in the surface zones of the extruded products at an angle to the direction of extrusion. In this manner the structure of the product is enhanced, while simultaneously the kneading operation reduces the risk of impurities in the plastics compound causing weak spots in the product.
