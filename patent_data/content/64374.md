## Description
11Method of Insulating and Insulating Structure The present invention relates to a method of insulating an area to reduce both thermal conductivity and the transfer of radiant heat, and to an insulating structure.The present invention in particular relates to specific polymeric materials which in conjunction with other materials as in the form of laminates provide a structure to insulate an area. The art is replete with numerous polymeric materials used either a one or in combination with other materials to form thermal screens, e.g., USPat. No. 3,730,891 heat insulating PVC film is are pared by treating PVC resin or copolymer with anhy .drous silica, plasticizer and stabilizer , US Pat. o. 4,076,889 heat insulating material produced by applying a metal to one surface of a film of polyfluoroolefin or f uorooefin copolymer . Of course, foamed polyurethane is among the best known and widely used insulating materials. Various other polymeric materials, both foamed and unfoamed, transluscent and opaque, alone and laminated have been similarly employed. Specific polymers employed herein are Poly iminoimidazolidinedione and poly parabanic acid resins.Both the poly iminoimidazolidinediones and poly parabanic acids and their methods of preparation are known from e.g., my commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 3,661,859. The poly parabanic acids may also be prepared by other processes, such as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,609,113. The poly iminoimidazolidinediones may be formed by the reaction of hydrogen cyanide with a diisocyanate or mixture of diisocynates, the reaction of a dicyanoformamide with a diisocyanate or mixtures of diisocyanates, or the polymerization of a cyanoformamidyl isocyanate and contain a 1,3 imidazolidinedione l, 3 diyl ring of the following structures in the repeating units EMI2.1 wherein NH is in the 4 or 5 position. The poly parabanic acids also designated as poly l,3imidazolidine 2,4,5 tri.ones may be prepared, for example, by the acid hydrolysis of poly iminoimidazolidinediones and contain the imidazolidinetrione ring in the repeating unit EMI2.2 U.S. Pat. No. 3,609,113 and German Patent No. 1,770,146 describe other methods for preparing polymers which contain the poly parabanic acid Ting. The polymers may contain both imino 1,3 imidazolidinedione l,3 diyl rings and imidazolidinetrione rings, thus the present polymers may be broadly chaT acterized as having the repeating unit EMI2.3 wherein Q isEMI2.4 wherein X is 0 or NH, provided that at least one X is 0, R is an organic moiety which may be aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic or mixtures thereof, and n is sufficiently large to produce a solid product. The R is the organic moiety of the diisocyanate when the polymer is produced according to the procedure in U.S. Pat. No. 3,661,859. Thus, the diisocyanates may be selected from a broad group having a large variety of organic moieties. The organic moieties of the diisocyanate may be substituted with groups such as alkyl, aryl, halogens, sulfoxy, sulfonyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, oxo, ester, alkylthio, arylthio, nitro and the like which do not react with the isocanate group. Functional groups which have active hydrogen atoms, e.g., carboxylic acids, phenols, amines, etc. should not be present. Specific diisocyanates which may be used are set out in US Pat.No. 3,661,859, other patents, articles or organic textbooks as known in the art. Some of the parabanic acid polymers have been found to have high glass transition temperatures, and thus are especially suitable as magnetic tapes where good dimensional stability at high temperatures is required , films for use in flexible printed circuits, cable wraps, etc., for fibers such as tire cord fibers where tensile strength and modulus are required , for moldings for electrical connectors, bearings, magnetic wire insulation, coatings for cables, cookware, glass fabrics, industrial belts where high temperatures are required and the like. In addition to having excellent thermal and physical properties, the films made from the polymers have the advantage of providing thermal and radiant insulation. These and other advantages and features of the present invention will become obvious from the following description. The present invention relates to an insulating structure comprising a film of non cellular polymer as described below, contiguous to a second material adjacent to said area, the second material preferably being glass, wood, metal, paper, asbestos or a polymeric material. The structure may be in the form of a laminate.The films are translucent and may be substantially clear.The invention also provides a method of thermally insula . ting an area comprising positioning adjacent to the area a thermal barrier comprising a structure of the invention As the term 1,thermally insulating an area is used herein, it is understood to mean that the structure of the defined polymer and second material present a thermal barrier at least 10 greater than the second material alone. A thermal barrier as that term is used herein means an impediment to the transfer or transmission of heat. The structure of the defined polymer and second material may entirely enclose an area or may separate a first area from a second area such that the two areas communicate around the structure, in which event it may be considered that either area is insulated. The non cellular film comprises heterocyclic polymers characterized in the repeating unit by the tri substituted 1,3 imidazolidine l,3 diyl ring EMI4.1 wherein X 0 or NH, provided at least one X is o or more especially polymers having the repeating unit EMI4.2 wherein Q isEMI4.3 and X has the significance set out above, R is an organic moiety which may be aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic or mixtures thereof and n is sufficiently large to produce a solid product. More particularly, the polymers may be poly iminoimidazolidines characterized by a tri substituted 1,3 imidazolidine l,3 diyl ring of the following structure EMI4.4 poly parabanic acids characterized by a tri substituted 1,3 imidazolidine l,3 diyl ring of the following structure EMI5.1 or more specifically, polymers of the general structure EMI5.2 EMI5.3 tb f c tb SEP N SEP SEP tb SEP L SEP o c SEP c o tb SEP n tb wherein R and n have the significance given above. The grout R may be an aliphatic hydrocarbon moiety such as a tetramethylene, hexamethylene, decamethylene or 2,2,4 trimethyl hexamethylene group, an aromatic hydrocarbon moiety such as a m phenylene, p henylene, biphenylene or 1,5 naphthalene group or an alicyclic hydrocarbon moiety such as a cyclohexane group. Other examples of the group R include toluene, durene, 4,4 diphenylmethane 3,3 dimethyl 4,4 biphenylene, 4,4 diphenylisopropylidene, D xylylene, m xylylene , 4,4 methylene bis cyclohexyl , 4 cyclohexyl phenyl or benzyl grouns. The group R may be substituted and examples of substituted moieties include the 4,4 diphenylsulphone, 4,4 diphenylether, 3,3 dimethoxy4,4 biphenylene, dipropylethe, isophorone, tetrafluoro p phenylene and 4 ,4 octafluorobiphenyl grounds. Preferred groups R include the methylenediphenyl and oxydinhenyl groups. R may also represent a mixture of groups, and preferably a mixture of methylenediphenyl and 2,4 tolylenediyl groups or a mixture of diphenyl and bitolylenediyl grouns. The structure may comprise the defined polymer film and any other material or substrate, such as glass, wood, metal, such as steel, copper or aluminum, paper, asbestos, other polymeric materials such as polyurethane, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene or the defined polymer, and me like which are used contiguous to said defined polymer and may consist of multiple layers of said other materials and said defined polymer. Laminates of the defined polymer to said other material are particularly preferred, although bonding the defined polymer to the other material is not essential to obtain the benefits of thermal and radiant heat insulation of the defined polymer films. It has been found that thin films of the defined polymer will adhere by static attraction to a glass surface, such as a window pane. The attraction between the two ma trials forms a type of laminate, even though the two are not fixedly adhered together. The Figure shows a defined polymer adhered to a glass plate. Films of the defined polymer may be made by melt extrusion or by casting from solution both of which are described in the prior art. Both methods provide the means for readily bonding the defined polymer to a substrate such as glass for the formation of a laminate. The solvent which may be employed from which the poly parabanic acid or precursor as defined above may be cast are moderate hydrogen bonding, aprotic solvents. The preferred solvents are N, N dimethylformamide, N methylpyrrolidone, N,N dimethylacetamide and dimethyl sulfoxide. The film may be cast onto glass and some degree of adhesion will be obtained. In any event, the film is cast from solution in the conventional manner. Such cast film may be adhered, if desired, to the second material with conventional adhesives such as solvent solutions of tacky materials. The static properties of the film may also be employed to adhere and hold the film to second material, such as glass. Extruded films of PPA polymers may also be employed. In order to successfully extrude the present polymers, it is necessary to plasticize them, since many of the present PPA polymers decompose when heated above their glass transition temperatures. Several types of plasticizer have been evaluated and variously disclosed for this purpose.One such group of plasticizers is aromatic nitriles seeEuropean patent application, Serial No. 81302519.4 publishedDecember 16, 1981 under No. 0041852. Isophthalonitrile and phthalonitrile are particularly preferred among this group. The extruded film may be extruded onto the second material, such as glass, or extruded conventionally and merely juxtaposed to the second material, with or without adhesive bonding. Normally, 10 to 50 wt. percent, more preferably up to 30 wt. , of the plasticizer will be employed, although lower 5 wit. and higher 60 wt. amounts, all based on the weight of polymer, may be used. The polymer and plasticizer blends are easily obtained by dry mixing powders of each when the plasticizer is a solid and forning a melt. The heating and extrusion may also be carried out in conventional eouipment. The thickness of the non cellular film would be at least 5 mils upto 10 milts 0.127to 0.254mm although thicker films could be employed, the benefit to be derived would not be economical. The effectiveness of the film of the defined polymer as insulating material may be further increased by coating a layer of aluminum thereon as described1 for example, in U.S. Patent No. s 3,942,135 and 4,081,300. The Figure shows a glass plate 11 to which is bonded a film of PPA M, clear, non cellular film 10, which provides a radiant heat barrier. EXAMPLES For purposes of illustration, the examples will be described with respect to a particular polymer, that is, a polyparabanic acid prepared from diphenylmethane diisocyanate to result in a high performance polymer having theEMI7.1 tb repeating SEP unit SEP show SEP below tb SEP 0 tb SEP U tb SEP C tb SEP sC SEP SEP CH2 SEP tb SEP O C SEP C O SEP W tb SEP n tb which is also designated as polyfll,4 phcnylenemethylene l, 4 phenylene 1,3 imidazolidine 2,4,5 trione 0 which is also designated in chemical abstracts as poly 2,4,5 trioxo 1,3 imidazolidinediyl 1,4 phenylenemethylene 1,4 phenylenJ . It has a high glass transition temperature of about 2900C and can not be extruded or molded by conventional tech niques. For purposes of convenience, this polymer species will be referred to as PPA M. In general, the preferred polymers of the poly mer plasticizer compositions are those which have suffi cient repeating units at room temperature to be solids. In addition to the polymer and plasticizers, it is contemplated that other appropriate additives which are not detrimental to the compositions such as those employed to stabilize against oxidation or ultraviolet light, flame retardants, pigments, fillers and the like may be present. The following example illustrates the present invention EXAMPLE The non cellular polymer films were evaluated for their effectiveness as insulation to radiant energy and thermal conductivity. EVALUATION A RADIANT HEAT Four boxes were constructed from 1 25.4mm thick rigid polyurethane foam which had a thermal conductivity of 0.14 BTU in. hr ft2 oF O.O2WmlOCl and a density of 0.032g. cc. The inside dimensions were 6 152.4mm wide, 12 304.smm long, and 6 152.4mm high. All edges of theboxes were sealed with aluminium duct tape. A 2500F 1210C thermo meter was inserted through the side of each box and positioned so that the mercury bulb was in the center of the box. The tops of the boxes were sealed on with duct tape.The tops were made of glass, glass coated with clear PPA M film, and 1 25.4mm thick rigid polyurethane foam as described. The boxes were mounted on a board adjacent to each other and placed in the direct sunlight on the roof of a building. The temperature inside each box was recorded at various times throughout the day. The results of this evaluation are reported in Table I. EVALUATION B THERtw1AL CONDUCTIVITY The thermal conductivities of two PPA M films were determined by placing the film 17 mm diameter between polished silver plates which could be kept at the given boiling points of two liquids by a constant supply of heat to the higher boiling point liquid. When steady equilibrium was attained, the lower boiling point liquid vaporized at a constant rate and was condensed and collected in a measuring vessel. The time for a given volume to distill was measured and the thermal conductivity was calculated. The ColoraThermo conductometer was used to make the measurements. The results of this evaluation are reported inTable U. TABLE 1A.
