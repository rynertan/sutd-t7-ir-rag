# A PIPE CONNECTOR

## Abstract
In making a connection between a pipe 1 and an outer sleeve 3 the sleeve 3 is mounted telescopically on the pipe and is crimped to the pipe by means of crimps 4. To ensure that a seal is provided the exterior of the pipe may be coated with a polymer film or with a layer of anaerobic adhesive before being inserted into the sleeve 3. Such connections may be used to interconnect two pipes or to connect associ ated components such as taps, T junctions and valves to such pipes.
