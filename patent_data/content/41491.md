## Description
New para substituted 3 phenoxy 1 alkylaminu propanol 2 s having beta receptor blocking properties.DESCRIPTIONTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to new compounds having valuable properties in treating acute myocardial infarction and patients undergoing different kinds of surgery while exerting beta receptor blocking activity, process for their preparation, pharmaceutical preparations containing said compounds, and methods for treating acute myocardial infarction.The object of the present invention is to obtain new compounds with beta adrenoceptor blocking activity and ith such a short biological halflife that the degree of beta adrenoceptor blockade easily can be controlled by means of the parenteral administration rate. Such compounds can then be used in the vulnerable phase of acute myo cardial infarction in order to reduce infarct size and also to prevent arrhythmias. The compounds may also be used as antiarrhythmics during various surgical procedures.Generally, the new compounds can be used in the treatment of all indications where B receptor blockers are used with the rastriction that they can only be used by way of intravenous and topic administrations. BACKGRDUND OF THE INVENTION Compounds of the general structureEMI2.1 where n is an integer 1 to 3, and RÚ is i.a. any substituent of the group alkyl, alkenyl, alkinyl, alkoxy, alkenyloxy, alkinyloxy, halogen, nitro, cyano, alkoxyalkyl, alkoxy alkoxy, aminoalkylamino, optionally substituted with one or two alkyl groups, aminocarbonylaminoalkyl, optionally substituted with one or two alkyl groups, aryl, aralkyl, aralkoxy and aroyl, and R2 is straight or branched alkyl, or hydroxyalkyl, cycloalkyl, or phenylalkyl, or phenoxyalkyl optionally substituted with alkyl, alkoxy, hydroxy, cyano, cyanomethyl, hydroxymethyl, or trifluoromethyl, are known to possess beta adrenoceptor blocking activity whereby they are used in treating angina pectoris, heart arrhythmi2s, hypertension, and glaucoma.Further, there are several indications that treatment with beta adrenoceptor blockers in the early phase of acute myocardial infarction may reduce infarct size cf Waagstein et al, 1977 In Acute and Long Term Medical Management ofMyocardial Ischaemia. Eds A Hjalmarsson and L llilhelmsen. Lindgren Soner AB, Mölndal, pp 346 357 and possibly also prevent arrhythmias. However, since the first attempt to use beta adrenoceptor blockers in acute myocardial infarction about 15 years ago, the treatment has been viewed with some doubt due to alarming reports of side effects cf Snow, P.J. Effects of propranolol in myocardial infarction. Lancet 2 551 553, 1965 , and it is evident that treatment with beta adrenoceptor blockers may be harmful to some patients with low cardiac output, severe heart failure and conduction disturbances. At present therefore very strict criteria are followed for the selection of patients for treatment with beta adrenoceptor blockers during the acute phase of myocardial infarction. And even then some patients with myocardial infarction do not tolerate the beta adrenoceptor blocker.A great advantage in this connection would be to use a very shortacting beta adrenoceptor blocker which could be given in a continuous intravenous infusion.The degree of beta blockade could then be easily controlled by changes of the infusion rate. Furthermore, if beta blockade is not tolerated by the patient the infusion could be stopped and the effect will then disappear within a few minutes due to the short half life of the drum. There would also be a great advantage to have a shortacting beta adrenoceptor blocker available in anaesthesiology and in the intensive care units. For example, arrhythmias are common in connection with incubation and laryngoscopy.It is known that these arrhythmias can be treated with beta adrenoceptor blockers. The now available beta blockers, however, are long acting and the blockade remains longer than needed.The present para substituted 3 phenoxy 1 alkylamino propanol 2 s of this patent application are all very shortacting, potent, beta1 selectivE blockers which can be used in the indications mentioned above These compounds should be infused intravenously at an infusion rate of 0.5 1.5 umol kg bodyweight x minute.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONIt has been found that the cumpounds of the general formula IEMI4.1 wherein R1 is selected from the group consisting of isopropyl and tert. butyl, R2 and R3 are each hydrogen, R5 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, and lower alkoxy, R4 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkoxyalkyl, cycloalkyl, phenyl, arylalkyl, and hydroxyalkylJ and n is an integer 1 or 2, and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof, and are shortacting, potent, beta elective adrenoceptor blockers.Alkyl R4 is an alkyl having up to 7. carbon atoms1 preferably up to 5 carbon atoms, which alkyl group can be straight or branched.

These new compounds can be used at the treatment of acute myocardial infarctions and arrhythmias. One may also use them as intermediates at the preparation of other valuable pharmaceutical compounds.Salt forming acids may be used in preparing therapeutically acceptable salts of the compounds. These are hydrohalogen acids, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic or heterocyclic carboxy or sulfonic acids, such as formic, acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, or pyrovic acid, phenylacetic, benzoic, p aminobenzoic, anthranilic, p hydroxybenzoic, salicyclic or p aminosalicyclic acid, embonic acid, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, hydroxy ethanesulfoni c, ethylenesulfonic, halogenbenzenesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, napthylsulfonic, or sulfanilic acid, methionine, tryptophane, lysine or arginine. The substances are intended to be administered parenterally for acute and chronic treatment of above mentioned cardiovascular disorders.The biological effects of the new compounds have been tested, and the different tests carried out will be shown and explained below.The new compounds are obtained according to methods known per se. Thus, a cpmpound of formula IIEMI8.1 2 3 4 5 wherein R2, 93, R4, R and n have the meanings given above, I is a hydroxy group, Z is hydroxy or a reactive, esterified hydroxy group, or X1 and Z together form an epoxy group, is reacted with an amine of the formula III H2NRÚ III wherein R has the meaning given above.A reactive, esterified hydroxy group is particularly a hydroxy group esterified with a strong, inorganic or organic acid, preferably a hydrohalogen acid, as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, or hydroiodic acid, further sulfuric acid or a strong organic sulfonic acid, e.g. benzenesulfonic acid, 4 bromobenzenesulfonic acid, or 4 toluenesulfonic acid. Thus, Z is preferably chloro, brorno or iodo.This reaction is carried out in a common way. At the use of a reactive ester as a starting material the prparation takes place preferably in the presence of a basic condensating agent and or with an excess of an amine. Suitable basic condensating agents are e.g. alkalimetal hydroxides as sodium or potassium hydroxide, alkalimetal carbonates as potassium carbonate and alkalimetal alcoholates as sodium methylate, potassium ethyiate and potassium tert.butylate.When Z is OH the reaction is carried out in the presence of a metal catalys,t, as Raney nickel.The reaction is preferably carried out in an alkanol having 1 to 4 carbon atoms by refluxing the reactants in said solvent for a time long enough to give the compound of formula I, generally 1 to 12 hours. However, the reaction can be carried out in the presence of an excess of amine alone. The reaction can also take place in an autoclave.Further a compound of formula IVEMI9.1 wherein R2, R3, R4, R5 and n have the meanings given above1 is reacted with a compound of the formula V ZR1 V wherein Z and R1 have the same meanings as given above.This reaction is carried out in a common way, preferably in the presence of a basic condensating agent and or an excess of an amine. Suitable basic condensating agents are e.g. alkaline alcoholates, preferably sodium or potassium alcoholate, or also alkaline carbonates as sodium or potassium carbonate This reaction is carried out with or without the presence of an alkanol having 1 to 3 carbon atoms in an autoclave being heated to 100 to 1300 C for 5 to 15 hours.Compound V above can be replaced with CH3 CH CH2 or CH3 2C CH2, whereby the alkylation reaction is carried out via aminomercuration.Further, a compound of formula VIEMI10.1 wherein Rê, R , R4, R5 and n have the same meaings as given above is reacted with a compound of formula VIIEMI10.2 wherein RÚ, Z and X1 have the same meanings as given above, except for Z being OH.This reaction is carried out in a common way. In those cases where reactive esters are used as starting material, the compound of formula VI may. suitably be used in the form of its metalphenolate as alkalimetalphenolate, pre ferably sodiumphenolate, or one works in the presence of an acid binding agent, preferably a condensating agent, which can form a salt of the compound of formula VI as an alkalimetal alcoholate. This reaction is preferably carried out in an alkanol hexing 1 to 3 carbon atoms in an autoclave being heated to 80 to 100 C for 1 to 15 hours, Further, a compound of formula VIEMI11.1 wherein Rê, R , R4, R5 and n have the same meanings as given above, is reacted with a compound of formula VIIIEMI11.2 wherein R1 has the meaning given above.This reaction is carried out in a common way. Thus, the reaction is carried out under alkaline conditions in a suitable solvent, as benzylalcohol by boiling the reaction mixture for some hours. Thereby the phenol is primarily converted to its metalphenolate as alkalimetalphenolat before it is added to the acetidinol of formula VIII. Further, one may split off a residue from a compound of formula I above, in which the nitrogen atom of the amino group and or the hydroxy groups have attached thereto a splitable residue.Such splitable residues are especially those which are splitable by solvolysis, reduction1 pyrolysis or fermentation.At this splitting off of a residue the para substituentEMI12.1 can be formed from another substituent X2 containing one or more at these conditions so reacting functional groups. Such functional groups are e.g. benzylic carbcnyl, hydroxyl or halogen, or carbon carbon unsaturation.Residues splitable by means of hydrolysis are e.g. an acyl residue, which1 when present, also can be functionally varied carboxy groups, e.g. oxycarbonyl residues1 28 alkoxycarbonyl residues, e.g. tert. butoxycarbonyl residue1 or ethoxycarbonyl residue1 aralkoxycarbonyl residues as phenylloeralkoxycarbonyl residues, e.g. a carjobenzyloxy residue, halogencarbonyl residue, e.g. a chlorocarbon residue, and carbamoyl groups. Further, arylsulphonyl residues as toluenesulfonyl or bromobenzenesulfonyl residues and possibly as halogenated, as fluorinated lower alkanoyl residues as formyl , acetyl or trifluoroacetyl residues or a benzyl residue or cyano groups or silyl residues, as trimethylsilyl residue. Of the above mentioned residues present at the hydroxy groups, which residues are splitable by hydrolysis, preferably the oxycarbonyl residues and the loweralkanoyl residues or the benzoyl residues are used.Besides the above mentioned also double bound residues, which are splitable at the amino group by hydrolysis are used, e.g. alkylidene or benzylidene residue or a phosphorylidene group as a triphenylphosphorylidene group, whereby the nitrogen atom then obtains a positive charge.Residues splitable at the amino group by hydrolysis are furthermore divalent residues as in occurring cases substituted methylene. As substituents on the methylene residues any organic residue may be used, whereby it does not matter at the hydrolysis which compound is the substituent to the methylene residue. As methylene substituents e.g. aliphatic cr aromatic residues as alkyl as mentioned above, aryl e.g.phenyl or pyridyl may be used. The hydrolysis may be carried out in any common way, suitably in a basic or preferably in an acid medium.Compounds having residues being splitable by hydrolysis are also the compounds according to formula IXEMI13.1 wherein R1, R2, P3, R4, R5 and n have the same meanings as given above and Y is a carbonyl, thiocarbonyl, or aEMI13.2 residue wherein A and B are each severally hydro gen, alkyl, alkylaryl or aryl.The hydrolysis is carried out in an analogous way, e.g.in the presence of a hydrolysing agent, e.g. in the presence of an acidic agent as e.g. diluted mineral acids, as sulfuric acid or hydrohalogen acid, or in the presence of basic agents as e.g. alkalimetal hydroxides, as sodium hydroxide. Oxycarbonyl residues, aryl sulfonyl residues and cyano groups may in a suitable way be split off by means of acidic agents as by means of a hydrohalogen acid, suitably hydrobromic acid. Preferably the splitting may take place using diluted hydrobromic acid, possibly in a mixture with acetic acid. Cyano groups are preferably split off by means of hydro romic acid at an elevated temperature, as in boiling hydrobromic acid, according to the bromo cyano method v. Braun . Further, e.g.a tert. butoxycarbonyl residue may be split off under an hydros conditions by means of a treatment with a suitable acid, as trifluoracetic acid. Acidic agents are preferably used at a hydrolysis of compounds of formulaIX.Residues splitable by ammonolysis are especially the halogencarbonyl residues, as the chlorocarbonyl residue. The ammonolysis may be carried out in a common way, e.g by means of an amine containing at least one hydrogen atom bound to the nitrogen atom, as a mono or diloweralkylamine e.g. methylamine or dimethylamine, or especially ammonia, preferably at an elevated temperature. Instead of ammonia one may use an agent which gives ammonia as hexamethylenetetraamine. Residues splitable by means of a reduction are e.g. an aerylalkyl residue, as a benzyl residue or an a aralkoxy carbonyl residue as a benzyloxycarbonyl residue, which in a common way may be split off by means of a hydrogenolysis, especially by catalytically activated hydrogen, as by hydrogen in the presence of hydrogenating catalysts, e.g. Raney nickel. Further residues splitable by means of hydrogenolysis are 2 halogenalkoxycarbonyl residues as 2,2,2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl residues or 2 iodoethoxy or 2,2,2 tri bromoethoxycarbonyl residues, which may be split off in a common way, suitably by means of a metallic reduction tso called nascerating hydrogen .Nascerating hydrogen may be obtained by the influence of metal or metal alloys, as amalgam on compounds which give hydrogen as carboxy acids, alcohols or water, whereby especially zink or zinkalloys together with acetic acid may be used. Hydrogenolysis of 2 halogenalkoxycarbonyl residues may further take place using chromium or chromium 11 compounds as chromium II chloride or chromium II acetate.A residue splitable by reduction may also be an arylsulfonyl group as a toluenesulfonyl group, which in a common way may be split off by reduction using.nascerating hydrogen, e.g. by means of an alkalimetal, as lithium or sodium in liquid ammonia, and suitably may be split off from a nitrogen atom. At the carrying out of the reduction one has to take care of the fact that other reducing groups are not influenced.Residues splitable by means of pyrolysis, especially residues splitable from the nitrogen atom, are in occurring cases substituted suitably unsubstituted carbamoyl groups.Suitable substituents are e.g. loweralkyl or arylloweralkyl as methyl or benzyl or aryl, as phenyl, the pyrolysis is carried out in a common way, whereby one may have to take care of other thermically susceptible groups. Residues splitable by means of fermentation, especially residues splitable from the nitrogen atom are in occurring cases substituted, however, suitably unsubstituted carbamoyl groups. Suitable substituents are e.g. loweralkyl or aryl loweralkyl, as methyl or be nzyl, or aryl as phenyl.The fermentation is carried out in a common way, e.g. by means of the enzyme urease or soy bean extract at about ZD C or slightly elevated temperature.Further, a Schiff s base of formula X or XIEMI16.1 or a cyclic tautomer corresponding to formula XI or formula XIIEMI16.2 can be reduced, wherein RÚ, Rê, R , R4, R5 and n have the same meanings as.given above, and whereby the compounds of formula XI and XII may exist together, too. This reduction is carried out in a common way, e.g.using a di lightmetalhydride, as sodiumborohydride, lithiumaluminiumhydride, using a hydride as Boran with formic acid, or by means of a catalytic hydrogenation, as with hydrogen in the presence of Raney nickel. At the reduction one has to take care of the fact that other groups are not affected. Further, the oxo group in the compound of formula XIIIEMI17.1 wherein, RÚ, Rê, R , R4, R5 and n have the same meanings as given above, can be reduced to a hydroxy group. This reduction is carried out in a common way, especially using a di lightmetalhydride, as mentioned above, or according to the Meerwein Pondorf Verley method or a modification thereof, suitably using an alkanol as 2 reaction component and as solvent, as isopropanol, and using a metalalkanolate, as metalisopropanolate, e.g.aluminium isopropanolate.Further, in a compound of formula XIVEMI17.2 wherein R1 and R5 have the meanings given above, and X2 is a residue, which is able to be transformed to a residue,EMI18.1 wherein R2, R3, R4, and n have the meanings given above, one transforms X2 to this residue. X2 can thus be a residue of the formulaEMI18.2 wherein R2, R3 and n have the meanings given above, which residue X2 is esterified in accordance with processes known per se. Such processes are e.g. esterification in a common way using a strong acid as a catalyst and or using any form of water removal.The carboxylic acid can also be esterified by alkylation of the carboxylate in a common way using or not using ion pair technic.Further the ester group can be formed at the esterification reaction from another functional group, e.g. from a nitril, reacting at these conditions.The residueEMI18.3 can also be obtained from XZ by e.g. reduction of a carbon carbon unsaturation and or from another functional group as e.g. a keto group. The desired ester can also be obtained by oxidation of the corresponding ketone.The residueEMI18.4 can also be obtained from x2 by splitting off, e.g. by hydrogenolysation of a functional group as e.g. a keto, hydroxy1 halogen, a group containing a nitrogen atom, and the like. R2, R3, R4 and n have the meanings given above. zThe residue X can also be of the formula EMI19.1 wherein Y is a leaving group such as alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylcarboxy, halogen, etc. The transformation intoEMI19.2 can then take place in different ways i.a.via methods as reesterification, esterification, and the like.Alkyl R2 and or R3 can also be attached by way of aC alkylation of an ester containing R2 and or R3 hydrogen. Further, one can react a compound of formula XIV above, wherein X2 is CH2 nZJ wherein n is an integer 1 or 2, andZ denotes a leaving group as e.g. halogen, or tosyl, with an acetic or propionic acid ester in the presence of a base, e.g. lithium dialkylamide in an aprotic solvent as e.g.tetrahydrofuran.Thus, the following reactions can take place as examples of the above mentioned reactions, where Xê is a group transformable intoEMI19.3 7In the following P is the group EMI19.4 wherein R1 and R5 have the meanings given above EMI19.5 EMI20.1 EMI20.2 being obtained fromEMI20.3 amide . Another method involving reaction and splitting off of a protecting group in the same operation is EMI21.1 Further, the oxo group in a compound corresponding to these of formula I and which carries an oxo group at a carbon atom bound to a nitrogen atom may be reduced by two hydrogen atoms. Sad compounds are e.g. such of the formula XVEMI22.1 wherein R and n have the meanings as given above.The reduction can be carried out according to the above described manner using complex metalhydrides, e.g.lithiumaluminiumhydride or di isobutylaluminiumhydride.Suitably the reaction takes place in an inert solvent as an ether, e.g. diethylether or tetrahydrofuran. Complex borohydrides can also be used especially when a selective reaction is wanted.Further, a compound of the present invention can be obtained by catalytic hydrogenation of a compound of the invention containing one or more substituents in the aromatic ring that can be split off by means of catalytic hydrogenation. Such substituents are F, Br, C1 and I.The splitting off can also take place in connection with prior mentioned methods.Depending on the process conditions and the starting material the end product is obtained either in free form or in the form of its acid addition salt, which is included in the scope of the invention. Thus, for example, basic, neutral or mixed salts may be obtained as well as hemiamino, sesqui or polyhydrates. The acid addition salts of the new compounds may in a manner known per se be transformed into free compounds using e.g. basic agents as alkali or ion exchanger. On the other hand, the free bases obtained may form salts with organic or inorganic acids. In the preparation of acid addition salts perferably such acids are used which form suitable therapeutically acceptable salts.Such acids are e.g. hydrohalogen acids, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic or heterocyclic, carboxy or sulfonic acids, as formic, acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, maleic, hydroxymaleic or pyruvic acid, phenylacetic, benzoic, p aminobenzoic, anthranilic, phydroxybenzoic, salicyclic or p aminosalicyclic acid, embonic acid, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, hydroxyethanesulfonic, ethylenesulfonic acids, halogenbenzenesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, naphthylsulphonic acids, or sulfanilic acid methionine, tryptophane, lysine or arginine.These or other salts of the new compounds as e.g. picrates may serve as purifying agents or the free bases obtained as the free bases are transformed into salts, these are separated and the bases are then set free from the salts again. According to the close relationship between the new compounds in free form and in the form of their salts it will be understood from the above and the below that, if possible, the corresponding salts are included in the free compound.The invention also relates to any embodiment of the process of which one starts from any compound obtained as an intermediate in any process step and one carries out the lacking process step, or one breaks off the process at any step, or at which one forms starting material under the reaction conditions, or at which a reaction component possibly in the form of its salt is present. Thus, one may react an aldehde of the formula XVIEMI24.1 4 5 wherein R2, R3, R , P and n have the same meanings as given above, with an amine of the formula XVII H2NRÚ XVII wherein R1 has the meaning given above in the presence of a suitable reducing agent, as one of the above mentioned. Thareby a compound of formula X is obtained as an intermediate, which then is reduced according to the invention.Further, one may in manner known per se react an amine of the formula IV with a keton of the formula XVIIIEMI24.2 in the presence of a suitable reducing agent, as one of the above mentioned to produce compounds of formula XI or XII as an intermediate, which then is reduced according to the invention.Further, in a compound of the formula XIXEMI24.3 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, and n have the same meanings as given above, and X3 is a residue transformable into R5,X3 is transformed into R5. can thus be a carbon carbon unsaturated residue and or a carbonyl dontaining residue which residues are hydro 5 genated to give a residue R . Thus an alkynyl or an alkynyl oxy group can be hydrogenated to give an alkenyl group, or an alkenyloxy group, respectively, or an alkyl group, or an alkoxy group respectively, depending on ho far the hydrogenation is carried out.Further X3 can be e.g. a residueEMI25.1 which is 5 hydrogenated to give an alkyl R Further X can be a residue OH which is eterified in a known way to give an alkoyx, alkenyloxy, or alkynyloxy group R5.Further, X can be hydrogen, whereby R5 being halogen, preferably chloro and bromo can be added.Thus, a compound of the formulaEMI25.2 whereby X is halogen or R5X is, e.g. tert.butylhypochlorite. The new compounds may, depending on the choice of staring materials and process, be present as optical antipodes or racemate, or, if they contain at least two asymmetric carbon atoms, be present as an isomer mixture racemate mixture .The isomer mixtures racemate mixtures obtained may depending on physical chemical differences of the component, be separated into the both stereoisomeric diastereomeric pure racemate e.g. by means of chroma tognaphy and or fractionated crystallization.The racemates obtained can be separated according to known methods, e.g. by means of recrystallization from an optical active solvent, by means of microorganisms, or by a reaction with optically active acids formic salts of the compound and separating the salts thus obtained, e.g. by means of their different solubility in the diastereomers, from which the antipodes by the influence of a suitable agent may be set free. Suitably useable optically active acids are e.g. the L and D forms of tartaric acid, di o tolyltartaric acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, camphersulfonic acid or china acid. Preferably the more active part of the two antipodes is isolated. Further one of the two enantiomers can be obtained by asymmetrical reduction of the corresponding Keto compound.Suitably such starting materials are used for carrying out the reactions of the invention, which material leads to groups of end products primarily especially desired and especially to the specifically described and preferred end products.The starting materials are known or may, if they should be new, be obtained according to processes known per se.In clinical use the compounds of the invention are administered normally by injection in the form of a pharmaceutical preparation, which contains an active component either as free base or as pharmaceutically acceptable, non toxic acid addition salts, e.g. the hydrochloride, lactate, acetate, sulphamate or the like in combination with a pharmaceutical carrier.Thereby the mentioning ofthe new compounds of the invention is here related to either the free amine base or the acid addition salts of the free base, even if the compounds are generally or specifically described, provided that the context in which such expressions are used, e.g. in the examples, with this broad meaning should not corresspond.The carrier may be a liquid diluent or a capsule. These pharmaceutical preparations are a further object of the invention. Usually the amount of active compound is between 0.1 to 99 by weight of the preparation, suitably between U.5 to 20 t D by weight in preparations for injection. Solutions for parenteral administration by injection may be prepared as an aqueous solution of a watersoluble pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the active compound, preferably in a concentration from about 0.5 by weight to about 20 by weight. These solutions may also contain stabilizing agents and or buffering agents and may suitably be available in different dosage unit ampoules.The daily dose of the active substance varies and is depending on the acceptance but as a general rule it is 1 109 mg min of active substance at intravenous administration, average weight humanl, more particularly 15 45 mg min.BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTIONThe following illustrates the principle and the adaption of the invention, however, without being limited thereto.Temperature is given in degrees Celsius.Example 1Preparation of methyl 3 4 2 hydroxy 3 isopropylaminopropoxylphenyllpropanoate Method a 4.5 g of methyl 3 14 C2,3 epoxypropoxy phenyl propanoat 15 ml of isopropylamine, and 25 ml of isopropanol were heated on a steam bath in an autoclave for 5 hours.

BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS ThA beta adrenoceptor blocking agents of the present invention were tested as regards their biological properties.All compounds were thereby tested in two different experimental models but with the same species, premedication and preparation. Cats males and females weighing 2.5 3.5 kg were pretreated with reserpine 5 mg kg bodyweight administered intraperitoneally about L6 hours before the experiments. The animals were pretreated with reserpine in order to eliminate the endogenous sympathetic control of heart rate and vascular smooth muscle tone. The cats were anaesthetized with pentobarbital t30 mg kg bodyweight administered i.p. and artificially ventilated with room air. A bilateral vagotomy was performed in the neck. Blood pressure was obtained from a cannulated carotid artery and heart rate was recorded from a cardiotachometer, triggered by the oscillations in blood pressure.The femoral artery of one hind leg was cannulated in both directions. Blood taken from the proximal part was pumped, at a constant flowrate, back into the distal part of the artery by means of a roller pump Watson Marlow . The perfusion pressure PP was recorded. Changes in PP indicated changes in the peripheral vascular resistance of the leg.Experiment AThe maximal heart rate and vasodilator responses to isoprenaline were established by injecting a high i.v. bolus dose of isoprenaline 2.0 mol kg . An isoprenaline infusion rate was then established which gave a heart rate response at steady state which was about 80 of the maximal heart rate response to isoprenaline. Usually this dose of isoprenaline was 0.25 umol kg x min. The vasodilator response to this dose of isoprenaline was also approximately 80 of maximal. The isoprenaline dose was then infused during periods of 20 minutes with an interval of 20 minutes between the infusion periods. The test compound was administered as an intravenous bolus injection seven minutes after start of each isoprenaline .infusion. The dose of the test compound was increased until total blockade of the isoprenaline responses was achieved.For each dose of the test compound the peak reduction of the isoprenaline heart rate response was expressed as per cent blockade according to the formula Reduction of the isoprenaline induced heart rate response beats min 100 x Control isoprenaline response beats min Per cent blockade for each dose was then plotted against log dose of the test compound. The ED 50 value i.e. the dose which produced half maximal blockade was nterpola ted. The plasma half life was estimated by the method of Levy Nagashima, R., O Reilly, R.A. and Levy, G., Clin. Pharma col. Ther., 10 1969 22 . The time from the peak inhibitory effect of each dose until 50 recovery was deter mined and plotted against log dose of the compound. The slope of the line obtained was calculated with linear regression. The slope equals 2.303 KE where KE is the rate constant for elimination. The plasma half life t 1 2 was then calculated according to the relation t 1 2 0.693 KE. Experiment B The maximal heart rate and vasodilator responses to iso prenaline were established by injecting a high i.v. bolus dose of isoprenaline 2.0 umol kg . An isoprenaline bolus dose which gave a heart rate response which was about BO of the maximal response was then tested out. Usually this dose of isoprenaline was 0.4 pmol kg. The vasodila tor response to this dose of isoprenaline was also approximately 80 of maximal.The test compound was then infused intravenously in in creasing doses. Each dose was given during 12 minutes with an interval of 18 minutes between doses.The control dose of isoprenaline was injected 10 minutes after start of each infusion of the test compound. The dose of the test compound was increased logarithmically until total blockade of the isoprenaline responses was achieved.The inhibitory effect of each dose of the test compound was expressed as per cent blockade according to the formula predrug isoprenaline isoprenaline response response during test compound 100 x infusion predrug isoprenaline responsePer cent blockade was thep plotted against log dose of the blocker and the ED 50 value was interpolated cf. above .The ED 50 for heart rate blockade and ED 50 for blockade of the vasodilatation could then be compared and the selectivity for the compound estimated. Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity was evaluated as the maximal heart rate elevation during infusion of the test compound.The experiments demonstrate that the compounds of the invention are potent beta adrenoceptor antagonists with a higher potency as regards blockade of the cardiac betaadrenoceptors than of vascular beta adrenoceptors.Furthermore, the estimated plasma half lifes of the compounds are shorter than ten minutes.
