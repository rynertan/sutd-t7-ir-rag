# Mobile cargo container with electro mechanical lock.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus comprising an electro mechanical device for locking and unlocking mobile cargo container doors, utilizing a re settable electronic combination lock arrangement 1 installed within the cargo container, which electro mechanically retains a special locking pin 8 inserted through a channel in the container door structure, such locking pin 8 being mechanically coupled to the existing latching handle 6 on the door exterior. The locking pin 8 , when retained by the electronic lock mechanism, restricts travel of the container door handle 6 sufficient to prevent opening of the container door. A keyboard 5 array of switches on the exterior of the cargo container, coupled to the electronic lock circuitry of the container interior, must be actuated in pre selected code sequence to energize the electronic lock mechanism, thus releasing the locking pin 8 and enabling manual movement of the door handle 6 as required to open the container door.
