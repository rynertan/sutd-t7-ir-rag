# OPTIMAL CONTROL POWER SYSTEM STABILIZER USING SIMULATING STATE VARIABLES

## Abstract
The present invention relates to an automatic device for depressing low frequency oscillation of power system. It consists of an electronic circuit incorporated in the original excitation regulator of a synchronous generator. This circuit can turn the input deviation of voltage ΔV into simulating state variable deviations of angular frequency Δω, of power ΔP and of power angle Δδ, and then outputs the sum of them according to the principle of optimal control. With the device of the present invention, the output capability of a remote power station may double, a whole set of measurement and feedback devices may be spared and the distortions in measurement may be avoided. The present device has further advantages of being small in size, cheap in cost, easy to establish and high in reliability.
