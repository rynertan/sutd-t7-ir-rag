# ELECTRONIC IGNITION SYSTEM FOR AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
A mechanically timed ignition system for an internal combustion engine has a variable reluctance transducer 10 mechanically operated by the engine to produce an output waveform having zero crossings coinciding with the desired instants of sparks. A comparator means A₁, A₂ at the input of an integrated ignition control circuit 11 is connected to a winding of the transducer 10 . The i.c. output point 2 , which controls a semiconductor switch 13 connecting an ignition coil 14 across a supply, is connected by a C R feedback path C₄, R₉ to the input of the comparator means, to provide transient positive feedback, which is effective at cranking speed to provide improved rejection of low level audio frequency in terference signals.
