# Terminated optical fiber and methods of making.

## Abstract
In order to connect two optical fibers 26 26 , each of two plugs 40 40 each having a passageway 41 in which is received an optical fiber is mounted in a connector body 42 . Each optical fiber comprises a core 25 and a cladding 27 . The plugs are destined to be received in a sleeve 75 of a coupler 60 such that their longitudinal axes 38 are coaxial. Alignment of the fiber cores 25 , at least radially of the longitudinal axes 38 , is accomplished by locating for each plug 40 the intersection 99 of a radial line 98 which extends through the centroid of the optical fiber core 25 with the periphery of the plug 40 . An orienting pin 43 is mounted in each connector body 42 in intentional radial alignment with the intersection 99 . The connector bodies 42 inserted into opposite ends of the coupler sleeve 75 to cause each pin 43 of each connector body 42 to be received in a slot 67 in the coupler 60 . The slots 67 are aligned so that when the connector bodies 42 are inserted into the coupler 60 , the pins 43 orient and cause the plugs 40 to be inserted into the sleeve 75 such that the centroids of the optical fiber cores 25 are aligned along a plane that originates at and extends radially from the longitudinal axes 38 .
