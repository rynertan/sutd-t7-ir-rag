# PPE COMPOSITION CONTAINING ETHYLENE METHYL ACRYLATE COPOLYMER

## Abstract
Compositions of polyphenylene ether resin, optionally containing an impact modifier are modified by incorporation of small amounts of a copolymer of ethylene and methyl acrylate. The resultant blends are moldable into articles having better Gardner falling dart impact strength than corresponding compositions similarly modified with low density polethylene, without detriment to other important physical properties of the compositions.
