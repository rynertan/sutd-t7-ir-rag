# SLICING MACHINES FOR COMESTIBLE PRODUCTS

## Abstract
A slicing machine 10 for comestible products has a reciprocally movable table 12, 12B which delivers product to be cut to a slicing station 15 at which a slicing mechanism 16 is located, mechanism 16 comprises knife blade 20 rotatably mounted eccentrically on a counterbalanced rota table carrier 21 and respectively powered by hydraulic motors 30, 31 which are operated by a hydraulic control system 28 . Table 12, 12B is driven by a hydraulic ram 32 operated by the control system 28 which incorporates a mechanism 38 for setting hydraulic fluid delivery pressure, the mechanism 38 incorporating pressure setting valves 45, 46, 47 governed by solenoid operated valves 43, 46 which are arranged such that when the temperature of the hydraulic fluid is below a nominal working temperattire the delivery pres sure established by the mechanism 38 is above a nominal working pressure and when the hydraulic fluid temperature reaches or exceeds the nominal working temperature the delivery pressure is established at the nominal working pres sure and is rendered variable by valves 43, 46, 47 which are responsive to the rotational speed of the carrier 21 such that when carrier speed reduces working pressure is elevated above the nominal level.
