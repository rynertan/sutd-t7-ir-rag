## Description
The present invention relates to a live attenuated human rotavirus vaccine and to a method of producing such a vaccine. It also provides a method of prevention of acute diarrhoea caused by such human rotavirus. Rotavirus particles were originally identified in 1974 in stool specimens by electron microscopy Bishop Rotaviruses are now recognised as an important cause of severe acute diarrhoea in young children throughout the world. After the initial identification of rotaviruses as causative agents of acute diarrhoea, efforts were made to culture them in a wide variety of cell lines without much success. Human rotaviruses have been broadly classified into two groups, those with short RNA S patterns and those with long RNA L patterns, based on the mobility of their RNA genome segments upon gel electrophoresis. In 1981, Sato The majority of strains so far grown are those with the L patterns. S pattern strains have proved difficult to grow and successful cultivation of only two strains of rotavirus with S patterns has been described to date for example, in 1982 by Kutsuzawa The inventors have succeeded in cultivating six human rotavirus strains of major epidemiological importance in Australia and in Papua New Guinea and in preparing live attenuated virus strains which show promise as a vaccine. The strains that caused epidemics of diarrhoea in Melbourne, Australia during 1977 1979 and in Papua New Guinea in 1979 were both S pattern strains, but were of different electropherotypes. The inventors were successful in cultivating S pattern viruses from 2 of 6 stool specimens selected that contained S pattern viruses. Others have found S pattern strains difficult to cultivate. The inventors used a modified procedure of cultivation as compared with the original procedure of Sato The inventors have successfully cultivated strains from whole faeces stored at 70 C, from faeces stored in PBS both at 20 and 70 C and from sucrose cushion pelleted virus stored at 70 C. Since the number of strains cultivated is small, it is not yet possible to draw conclusions about the optimal storage conditions of faecal specimens for cultivation of virus. The invention also provides a vaccine for providing immunological protection against acute diarrhoea caused by human rotavirus, which comprises either a live attenuated strain of the virus designated Hu Australia 10 25 10 77 L being the subject of ATCC Deposit No. VR 2104 dated 1st February, 1985 or a live attenuated strain of the virus designated Hu Australia 1 9 12 77 S being the subject of ATCC Deposit No. VR 2105 dated From 1973 onwards, the inventors have been storing rotavirus strains identified in faeces of children with acute diarrhoea. Most of these specimens were obtained from Australian children. In addition, the inventors used specimens obtained by collaborative epidemiological surveys conducted in Indonesia and in Papua New Guinea. Many of these stored strains had been examined by gel electrophoresis of genome RNA for example, in 1981 by Rodger Faecal specimens containing rotavirus particles of known electropherotypes were selected by the inventors. The objective was to cultivate human rotavirus strains that had caused major outbreaks of acute diarrhoea in children in Australia and elsewhere. Specimens were stored either as whole faeces, 20 faecal homogenates in phosphate buffered saline PBS, pH 7.0 or as sucrose cushion pelleted virus either at 70 C or at 20 C for varying periods. The diarrhoeal stools selected for cultivation all contained a large number of predominantly double shelled virus particles 2 4 or greater than 10⁸ virus particles ml under electron microscopy . The details of the specimens are as follows i The technique of cultivation generally followed that of Sato The faecal specimens containing rotavirus were thawed, and whole faecal samples homogenised to form a 20 suspension in PBS. All specimens were then vortexed and centrifuged at 3,000g for 10 minutes. The supernatants were made bacteria free by passing through 0.45 m membrane filters Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA, USA . Inocula were pretreated with 10 µg ml of trypsin Sigma, trypsin 1X, Sigma Co., St. Louis, MO, USA . The maintenance medium DMM during virus multiplication contained 1 µg of trypsin per ml. Virus concentrations in the inocula were checked by electron microscopy. The inocula were used only if concentrations of virus particles were greater than 10⁸ virus particles ml. 1.0 ml aliquots of the faecal material treated with trypsin were inoculated into 2.0 ml cell cultures of MA 104 cells grown as confluent cell monolayers in roller tubes. Sato Each specimen was inoculated into duplicate tubes. Cells from one tube were used for immunofluorescent staining for monitoring virus multiplication after each passage using rabbit antiserum against simian virus SA 11 and goat FITC conjugated anti rabbit IgG goat immunoglobulin, conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate, distributed by Tago Inc, Burlingame, CA, USA . The other culture tube was used for the next passage. At each passage, 1.0 ml of undiluted material from the previous passage was used as inoculum. This feature may also be contrasted with the technique used by Serial passages were performed until cytopathogenic effect CPE became evident. The culture fluid was then examined for virus by electron microscopy see 1980 paper by Whitby ii F Rh L 2 cells DBS FRhL₂ 2, distributed by ATCC, Rockville, Maryland, U.S.A. were grown in minimal essential medicium Eagle , to which was added non essential amino acids in Earles BSS BME , 10 foetal calf serum FCS, Flow Laboratories, Sydney, Australia and 12.5 µg ml each of neomycin sulphate and polymyxin B sulphate. Human rotavirus strain RV 3 see following description , previously cultivated in MA 104 cells, was innoculated into seven day old confluent monolayers of cells in small plastic flasks. The technique of cultivation then followed that described above. Serial passages were performed at 2 7 day intervals, and virus multiplication was monitored by enzyme immunoassay EIA and later by immunofluorescent staining. This has been described elsewhere Rodger After adaptation to stationary cell culture, the viruses were plaqued see 1981 paper by Urasawa Six human rotavirus strains were successfully adapted to cell culture out of 16 stool specimens studied. Three of these strains were isolated from stools stored in PBS at 70 C, one from sucrose cushion pelleted virus stored at 70 C, one from faeces stored in PBS at 20 C and one from faeces stored at 70 C. Characteristic intracytoplasmic fluorescence was observed for these six strains from first passage until CPE appeared. One other strain showed initial fluorescence for 3 passages, but this subsequently disappeared. The remaining 9 specimens showed no intracytoplasmic fluorescence from first passage until tenth passage, at which stage, the viruses were judged uncultivable. For all the cultivable strains, CPE appeared between six and nine passages. It consisted of increased granularity, rounding into clusters and ultimate sloughing of cells 3 to 5 days after inoculation of a MA 104 cell monolayer. No difference in CPE was observed between various strains. Examination of cell culture fluids after the appearance of CPE showed mixtures of single and double shelled virus particles. The six cultured viruses are named herein using a modification of the nomenclature scheme first proposed in 1979 by Rodger and Holmes Comparison of genomes of simian, bovine and human rotaviruses by gel electrophoresis and detection of genomic variation among bovine isolates. J. Virol. When reference sera for identification of serotype and sub group are available, it will be possible to add this information to the cryptogram for each strain. The cryptograms and new laboratory designations for the cultivated strains according to the invention are as follows The RNA patterns using the gel electrophoresis technique according to Rodger Three strains, RV 4, RV 5 and RV 6 formed plaques of varying sizes 0.25mm 3.5mm . One strain, RV 3 produced plaques which consisted of thickening of cells similar to that described in 1982 by Faulkner Valle In Figure 2, plaque formation by human rotaviruses RV 5 B and RV 3 C is compared with uninfected cell control A . Areas of clearing are noticeable in B and areas of thickening in C. Human rotavirus RV 3 is known to belong to rotavirus subgroup 2 on the basis of gel electrophoresis of RNA genome, and to be serotype 3 on the basis of its reactions to polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. RV 3 is also identified specifically by use of a monoclonal antibody developed in the Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Children s Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. This antibody is designated Mab RV 3 3 previously designated 101AB5 B8 . It reacts 1,000 times more strongly with RV 3 than with any other rotavirus tested. RV 5 is known to belong to rotavirus subgroup 1 by gel electrophoresis of RNA genome and to be serotype 2 by reaction to polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies . Part of the unique biochemical structure of RV 5 is now known, as described in Dyall Smith M.L. and Holmes I.H., Sequence homology between human and animal rotavirus serotype specific glycoproteins . Nucleic Acids Research 1984 , A preferred route for the preparation of the vaccine according to the invention follows current WHO standards for live poliomyelitis vaccine oral , with appropriate modifications, Requirements for poliomyelitis vaccine oral . WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization, 33rd Report, Technical Report Series 687 pp. 107 to 174. WHO Geneva 1983. Initial oral vaccination is preferred before three months of age, preferably soon after birth, followed by a second vaccination three months later, when maternal antibody in infant serum has fallen to low levels. It appears that children are most vulnerable to severe clinical disease if infection occurs after this age. Although vaccination of the mother will provide a high titer of serum antibodies in the infant at birth, it is unlikely to protect against rotavirus infection after three months of age. The number of strains of rotavirus that are needed in an oral vaccine is not yet clear, but it is thought that infection by a single strain is sufficient to confer protection against severe disease caused by other strains. However, a preferred vaccine comprises a suspension of one or several serotypes of live attenuated human rotavirus which has or have been grown in cultures of a human or monkey diploid cell strain. One or two doses of such vaccine would be administered by the oral route. A live attenuated strain of the virus designated Hu Australia 10 25 10 77 L was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection ATCC on 1st February, 1985 and given the no. VR 2104. A live attenuated strain of the virus designated Hu Australia 1 9 12 77 S was deposited with the ATCC on 1st February, 1985 and given the no. VR 2105.
