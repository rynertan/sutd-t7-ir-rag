# Fishing reel.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a fishing reel comprising a reel body 1 having a front wall 1a and side walls 1c, 1d a rotary frame 7 disposed in front of the front wall 1a of said reel body 1 and having a tubular shaft 3 rotatably mounted in said reel body 1 . A spool 11 is disposed in front of said reel body frong wall 1a and has a spool shaft 9 . An operating handle 23 is mounted on one of the side walls 1c of the reel body 1 and a drive transmission means 61, 31, 62, 81 is formed and arranged for transmitting rotational drive from said handle 23 to provide rotation of the rotary frame 7 and reciprocal axial movement of the spool shaft 9 . The rotary frame 7 has a support plate 71 , a generally tubular body 72 and a pair of support arms 73, 74 , said tubular body 72 having therein an inner space S . In known such designs the reciprocal drive means is housed in the reel body thereby necessitating a relatively large and heavy reel body. According to this invention the drive transmission means includes an obliquely extending groove 91 provided on the outer surface of the spool shaft 9 and an engage ment member 40 disposed for guided engagement with said groove 91 within said inner space S and for rotation by the drive transmission means together with the rotary frame 7 .
