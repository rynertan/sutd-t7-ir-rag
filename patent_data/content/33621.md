# Solvent refining of coal using octahydrophenanthrene enriched solvent and coal minerals recycle.

## Abstract
Ash containing raw coal 10 is converted to a liquid fuel product 62 by contacting the coal with hydrogen and an 0HP enriched solvent containing OHP and THP in a ratio OHP THP greater than 0.4, wherein the OHP is present in an amount of at least 5 weight percent of the solvent, to produce a liquid stream 60 and a coal minerals stream, and recycling at least a portion of the coal minerals stream. A portion of the liquid stream 64 is catalytically hydrogenated 68 , prefer ably with a tungsten containing catalyst, to increase the ratio of OHP THP to a value greater than 0.4 or preferably greater than 1. The OHP enriched liquid stream solvent is passed as solvent to a mixing zone 11 where it is admixed with raw coal 10 and recycled coal minerals 38 , admixed with hydrogen 58 and passed to a preheater 20 and dissolver 24 . The use of the OHP enriched solvent improves coal solvation and liquid distillate production, while the recycle of coal minerals assists in maintaining a high OHP level in the circulated pro cess solvent. By increasing the OHP THP ratio to a value greater than 1, the amount of hydrogen consumed in the process can be significantly reduced.
