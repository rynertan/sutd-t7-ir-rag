# Method for the colorimetric determination of polygarboxylates and sulphonates inaqueous systems.

## Abstract
The concentration of sulphonate and or polycarboxylate compounds in an aqueous solution is determined by adjust ing the pH of a portion of the aqueous solution to less than 3.0 when measuring sulphonate concentration or to between 3.0 and 12.0 when measuring polycarboxylate concentra tion adding an effective amount of an aqueous solution of a metachromatic dye to the pH adjusted portion measuring the absorbency of the resulting admixture at a wavelength between 300 nm and 700 nm and comparing this absorben cy with absorbencies of standard samples containing known concentrations of polycarboxylate compounds and or sul phonate compounds, thereby determining the desired sul phonate and or polycarboxylate concentration.
