## Description
DuctingThis invention relates to heating systems and more specifically, although not exclusively, to radiant heating systems, and the present invention is particularly concerned with ducting for use with such systems.According to the present invention there is provided ducting for use in a heating system, said ducting having first and second passageways, one of which communicates with air supply means for said heating system and the other of which communicates with exhaust means of said heating system, each of said passageways being open at at least one end so that the said one of said passageways can supply air to said supply means and exhaust gas can expel from the said other of said passageways.Preferably, said ducting will be formed from a single piece of sheet material, in its preferred form stainless steel, said sheet of material being bent and formed to provide said first and second passageways.Said ducting will preferably be formed in unit lengths and will preferably be parallelogrammic in crosssection. More particularly, the ducting in crosssection will have the form of a rhombus.In order that the invention may be more readily understood, an embodiment thereof will now be described, by way of example, reference being made to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 shows an example of a heating system incorporating ducting according to the invention Figure 2 shows the ducting of Figure 1 in greater detail and to a larger scale Figure 3 shows how the ducting of Figures 1 and 2 is constructed andFigure 4 is a schematic, plan view of an example of a heating system layout. Referring to the drawings, Figure 1 shows a bank of radiant heaters 1 slung below a ceiling, each of said radiant heaters having a reflective housing 2 having at the top a lower passageway which communicates with a burner in a burner and suction fan control unit 3 for supplying hot air to the burner and, above this passageway, an upper passageway which communicates with a suction fan receiving exhaust gas therefrom. Under the housing 2 is a U tube 4, one end of which communicates with the burner, and the other end with the suction fan.For supplying air to the lower passageway and receiving exhaust gas from the upper passageway of each housing 2, there is provided a run of ducting 5 which at each end communicates with outside air through a wall of the building in the manner of a balanced flue. Ducting 5, see Figure 2, is formed by serially connecting together individual unit lengths 5A of ducting by means of coupling devices Sub in order to provide the requisite amount and form of ducting for the system.Each of the unit lengths of ducting 5A, referring now to Figure 3, is formed from a single sheet of metal, such as stainless steel or galvanized steel, which is bent and formed to have the cross sectional shape, i.e. substdantially that of a rhombus, as shown in Figure 3, welded joints being provided as indicated by reference numerals 6 and 7. The ducting 5 thus provides first and second generally V shaped passageways 8 and 9, separated one from the other by a portion 11 of the metal sheet, the passageway 8 being in communication with the upper passageways of the.housing 2 of the heaters, and the passageway 9 being in communication with the lower passageways of said housings, such communication being via respective lengths of trunking 10 each constructed like the trunking 5, expansion joints lOA being provided to accommodate relative movement between the trunkings 5 and 10.Adjacent to each of the housings 2, that is between the trunking 5 and each housing 2, there will preferably be provided what might be generally termed an optimiser which will effectively invert the passageways such that the lower passageway of each housing 2 may communicate with the upper passageway 9 of the ducting 5, and such that the upper passageway of each housing 2 may communicate with the lower passageway 8 of the ducting 5. Such an arrangement is desirable so that the maximum amount of heat in the exhaust gas can be utilised to pre heat the air passing to the burners of the heaters. Exhaust gases issuing from the U tubes 4 of the heaters will leave the U tubes at approximately 2000C and because heated air rises, the heated air will move towards the upper regions of the passageway 8 of the ducting, i.e. adjacent to the portion 11 of the ducting.Thus by heat transferance through the said portion 11 the cold air entering into and passing along passageway 9 will be pre heated prior to passing to the burners. By this arrangement, less fuel is required to raise the temperature of the air passing to the U tube. If the flows of air and exhaust gas were not inverted, such that the passageway 9 was the exhaust passageway and the passageway 8 was for incoming air, the exhaust gases would rise within the upper passageway 9, that is they would move away from the portion 11 of the ducting so that less heat would be available for raising the temperature of the incoming air in the lower passageway 8.In use of the heaters 1, air is drawn into the lower passageway of each housing 2, via the upper passageway 9 of the ducting 5, and exhaust gas is expelled from the upper passageway of each housing 2 and thence to atmosphere via the lower passageway 8 of the ducting 5.Figure 4 shows a schematic plan view of a possible layout of heaters 1 and trunkings 5 and 10.
