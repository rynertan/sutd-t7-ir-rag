# Rolled core.

## Abstract
A rolled core is formed by winding a thin body 10 of an amorphous magnetic alloy having positive magnetostriction characteristics so that, of the two surfaces 12 , 14 , the sur face 12 of smaller surface coarseness faces inward. This rolled core is improved in iron loss over a rolled core obtained by winding the thin body so that the surface 14 of greater surface coarseness faces inward. Breakage of the thin body 10 tends to occur less frequently when it is wound so that the surface 12 faces inward.
