# Method of securing simple codes.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of securing simple codes 5 , which are built up of a plurality of lines, symbols or patterns, which are readable by a machine, and which codes 5 are intended to be located on documents 2 , valuable documents or marked units. The invention is characterized in that at the generating or writing down of the codes 5 one or more of said lines, symbols or patterns constituting the code 5 each are caused to transform to a line 11 or an area, which does not constitute a part of the code 5 , but constitutes a part of the pattern, in order to render a falsification by altering the code after its writing down substancially more difficult. According to a preferred embodiment the invention fur ther is characterized in that a so called line code 5 is generated, and at its generation or writing down one or several of the lines associated with the code are caused to continuously or intermittently transform to a line 11 deviat ing from the line associated with the code.
