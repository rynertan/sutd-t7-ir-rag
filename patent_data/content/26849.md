# Process for producing anthracycline glycosides.

## Abstract
The invention is to provide a new process for produc ing daunomycin and baumycins having potent antitumor activity and low toxicity by microbial conversion of anthra cyclinones such as aklavinone and Îµ rhodomycinone, using microorganism selected from the group consisting of Streptomyces coeruleorubidus ME130 A4 FERM P 3540 , Streptomyces peucetius subsp. carneus ATCC 21354, Streptomyces coeruleorubidus ATCC 13740, Streptomyces peucetius NRRL B 3826 FERM P 3989 and their mutants.
