# Injection molded universal joint.

## Abstract
An injection molded universal joint 10 includes a central retaining member 40 captured between spherical balls 30, 32, 34, 36 seated in bores 22, 24, and 26, 28 located in diametrically opposed arms 14, 16, and 18, 20 of respective shaft members 11, 12 . The spherical balls are each pressed through an associated bore until a portion of the ball extends radially inwardly of the arm, and then maintained in position by a plastic material 80 insert molded into and retained in the bore. The insert molded plastic material 80 retains each of the spherical balls in place and permits the central retaining member 40 to be accurately positioned and with a predetermined preload applied to the universal joint 10 .
