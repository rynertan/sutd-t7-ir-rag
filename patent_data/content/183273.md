# Serial interface system flexibly applicable to a one to plurality connection.

## Abstract
In a serial interface system wherein a master unit 21 selects one or more of slave units 26, 27 as a destination by an indentification number assigned to each slave unit and transmits a data signal to the destination in synchronism with a clock signal, a control path 34 is added to a serial interface 31 33 . When one of the slave units acts as a source either in transmitting data to the master unit or in transfer ring data to one or more of other slave units selected as a destination, the source activates the control path to activate, in turn, the master unit. Activated, the master unit sends a clock signal to the interface to make the source transmit or transfer the data in synchronism with the clock signal. Alternatively, the control path is dispensed with. In this event, the master unit is activated either by command signal produced by the master unit or by a like command signal sent from a source to the interface in response to an interrogation from the master unit. Preferably, signals except for the clock signal are sent either from the master unit or from the source with an identification code included in each frame of the signals to indicate each of the slave units by the identification number that is concerned with the signals.
