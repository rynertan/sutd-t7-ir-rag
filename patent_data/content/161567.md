## Description
MULTIPLE SETTING CONTROL FOR VEHICLE INDICATING AS OR OPERATING DEVICESThe present invention relates to a multiple setting con trol for vehicle indicating and or operating devices, such as the lights and direction indicators or the wind screen and rear window wipers.Most of the indicating and, or operating devices on vehi cles are currently known to be controlled by two or three control levers projecting radially from opposite sides of the steering column. Angular displacement of the said levers in relation to the steering column to which they are hinged activates respective switches located inside the steering column and designed to control the said indicating and or operating devices according to the angular position of the respective control lever. Shown controls with multiple setting levers therefore involve serious assembly and maintenance problems, in that the control, including all the electric components on it, must perforce be assembled on line straight on to the vehicle, thus resulting in numerous vell known dravbacks in terms of assembly efficiency, fitting work and assembly time. Furthermore, should servicing be required, access to both the electric and mechanical components on such controls entails dismantling the steering vheel and part of the steering column, as well as the undamaged part of the control for obtaining access to the parts requiring maintenance.The aim of the present inventiOn is to provide a multiplesetting lever control designed to fit on to a vehicle steering column and having a structure enabling fast assembly and maintenance and troublefree assembly and re moral of both its mechanical and electrical components.A further aim of the present invention is to provide a control of the aforementioned type on which both the electric and mechanical components may be pre assembled separately and independently off the assembly line.with these aims in viev, the present invention relates to a multiple setting control for vehicle indicating and, or operating devices, the said control comprising at least one control lever projecting radially in relation to the steering column on the vehicle a connecting mem ber supporting the said lever and in relation to which the said lever may be set selectively in a number of different angular positions and switch means operated by the said lever for controlling the said indicating and or operating devices characterised by the fact that the said connecting member comprises a supporting body, designed to fit integral vith the said vehicle on the said steering column, and at least one control box housed in removable manner inside a respective seat on the said supporting body and comprising the said switch means, means for securing the said control lever and means enabling connection to the electric circuit on the vehicle.A non limiting arrangement of the present invention will now be described with reference to the attached drawings in which Fig.1 shows a longitudinal section of a control accord ing to the present invention Fig.2 shows a plan view of two details on the Fig.1 control in the assembly position Fig.s 3 and 4 show respective sections along linesIII III and IV IV of the Fig.1 control Fig.5 shows a section along line V V in Fig.4 Fig.s 6 and 7 show a plan view and elevation respective ly of a detail on the Fig.1 control.Number 1 in Fig.1 indicates a multiple setting control for indicating and or operating devices on a vehicle not shown , such as known types of direction indicators, parking lights, windscreen rear window washers and wipers or similar not shown . Control 1 comprises a control lever 2, projecting radially in relation to steering column 3 on the said vehicle, and a connecting member supporting lever 2 and in relation to which the said lever 2 may be set selectively in a number of different angular positions.The said connecting member is designed to fit on to the said steering column 3 and comprises, according to the present invention, a supporting body 4, designed to fit integral with the vehicle on the said steering column 3, and at least one control box 5 housed in removable manner inside a seat 6 on supporting body 4, connected integral vith lever 2 and housing means for securing a respective end 7 on the said lever 2, and respec tive switch means operated by lever 2 for controlling the said indicating and or operating devices on the said vehi cle not shown .In more detail, supporting body 4 comprises a tubular member 8, designed to fit coaxial and integral with steering column 3 a bushing 9, mounted in idle manner inside tubular member 8 and designed to engage, in angularly integral manner by means of tooth 10, rotary steering column 11 on steering column 3 and a pair of cup shaped members 12, located on opposite sides of tubular member 8, formed integral with and projecting radially from the same and each defining internally a seat 6 for housing a respective control box 5. For simpli fying matters, in the non limiting example shown, only one of the said cup shaped members 12 is shown with its respective box 5 fitted inside seat 6, uhereas the opposite member 12 is shown without box 5 inside respective seat 6.Supporting body 4 is preferably formed entirely from synthetic plastic reasin and provided with fastening means, e.g. one or more screws 13, for securing it to steering column 3.As shown also in Fig.s 2 and 3, each control box 5 comprises a hollow, essentially parallelepiped, self support ing case 14 housing end 7 of lever 2, the means for securing the said lever 2 to box 5, and a number of electrical connectors 15, the latter being fitted partly outside case 14 and being designed to enable fast elec trical connection of the said switch means, housed inside box 5, to a known type of electrical circuit not shown on the said vehicle not shown . According to the present invention, the said case 14 is defined by a pair of essentially cup shaped half casings 16 Fig.2 and 18 Fig. 3 designed to fit together with their inner concave sides facing, so as to define, inside case 14, a chamber 19 for housing the said switch means and the said means for securing the said end 7 of lever 2.According to the non limiting example described and illustrated herein, the said lever 2 is designed to turn, in relation to steering column 3, in two essentially perpendicu lar planes, in such a manner as to be turned by the operator of control 1 in a plane essentially parallel with that of the steering wheel not shown on the vehicle, as well as round an axis parallel with the said plane and such as to enable lever 2 to be drawn towards or pushed away from the operator. In Fig.2, half casing 16 is shown beside half casing 16a, which forms part of a control box similar to box 5 not shown and designed to fit inside the free seat 6 on supporting body 4 so as to position half casing 16a in relation to half casing 16 on box 5 as shown in the plan view in Fig.2. The said half casing 16 comprises an essentially flat bottom wall 20 and is designed to house all the electric circuits on control 1. Half casing 18, on the other hand, houses end 7 on lever 2, together with the said securing means and, generally speaking, all the mechanical devices on control 1. In more detail, bottom wall 20 on half casing 16 is provided with respective through holes 21 for enabling the said connectors 15 to come out of box 5 through wall 20 with an external seat 22 for housing connectors 15 and designed to receive a respective connecting plug of any known type for connecting the said connectors 15 to the said electric circuit not shown on the vehicle not shown on to which control 1 may be fitted and with an essentially parallelepiped, box shaped projec . tion 23 arranged with its axis essentially parallel to that of tubular member 8 and connectors 15 and having an internal cavity 24 housing, according to a preferred arrangement of the present invention, any known type of switch box 25 having a control rod 26 housed in sliding manner inside a further hole 27, formed through bottom wall 20, and of such a length as to penetrate deep inside chamber 19 so as to cooperate with end 7 of lever 2 and so be displaced by rotation of the latter.According to the present invention, box 5 in chamber 19 houses, against bottom wall 20, an essentially flat print ed circuit 28 supported on half casing 16 and shown clear ly in the plan view in Fig.2. On its upper face 29, facing avay from wall 20, the said printed circuit 28 is provided with a number of conducting tracks 30 defining a complete control circuit, which may be further extended by welding printed circuit 28 with electrical components 31, such as resistors, timers, condensers or similar, and fixed contact 32 which is thus supported by printed circuit 28 itself.The latter also has a lower face 33 facing and resting on bottom wall 20 and fitted in projecting manner with connectors t5 which, according to the present invention, are supported integral vith print ed circuit 28, by means of respective fastening holes 34 formed through the said printed circuit 28, and which are connected electrically, through holes 34, to conduct ing tracks 30. According to the present invention, print ed circuit 28 is also fitted on face 29 with a sliding pad 35, shown in enlarged scale in Fig.s 6 and 7, made of non conducting material and having, towards face 29, a multiple blade contact 36 designed to cooperate in sliding manner with fixed contact 32 for opening or dos ing the electric circuits defined by conducting tracks 30 subsequent to displacement of lever 2.According to the present invention, pad 35 is secured to printed circuit 28 in such a manner as to be pre assembled on to the said circuit 28, prior to insertion of the latter inside half casing 16 together with connectors 15 and electric components 31, by means of a pair of through guide slots 37 into which are locked respective flexible pins 38 on pad 35 itself, formed through printed circuit 28. Pad 35 is provided with a shift pin 39 designed to engage, as explained later on, with the means securing lever 2, in such a manner as to slide pad 35 along slots 37 subsequent to rotation of lever 2 in a plane parallel to that of printed circuit 28.End 7 on lever 2 is hinged by means of pin 40 to a cupshaped body 41 housed in mobile manner inside chamber 19 and itself housing end 7. Cup shaped body 41 is hinged to half casing 18 by means of hinge pin 42, the latter being coaxial with hole 27 and essentially perpendicular to bottom wall 20 and to the corresponding opposite bottom wall on half casing 18, with which it is integral. The said pin 42 is engaged in idle manner by hole 43 formed on the outside of cup shaped body 41 which is also provided with a recess 46 and a connecting seat 44 for a further hinge pin 45 formed coaxially with pin 49 inside half casing 16 and integral vith bottom wall 20.When half casings 16 and 18 are mated, recess 46 and seat 44 are connected respectively to pin 45 and shift pin 39, so as to enable body 41 to turn inside case 14, following operation of lever 2 by the user, and so slide pade 35 and, consequently, operate the svitch means consisting, according to the present invention, of pad 35 itself on printed circuit 28. pin 40 is arranged with its axis parallel to printed circuit 28 so as to enable lever 2 to turn simultaneously round pins 42 and 45 in a plane parallel to that of printed circuit 28, and round pin 40 in a plane perpendicular to the said print ed circuit 28, in such a manner as to shift rod 26 and so activate known switch box 25. In which case, contact 32 and box 25 may be used for controlling the washer and wiper on the uindscreen and rear window respectively.Body 41 is also provided with a corresponding hole 48 formed coaxially with seat 44 and designed to enable the passage of rod 26 towards end 7 on lever 2.According to the present invention, half casing 18 is also fitted inside with a device for contrasting and set ting operation of lever 2, the said device comprising a plate 50, locked between mated half casings 16 and 18 and having a shaped edge 51 defined by respective in dined surfaces 52, and a pair of push rods 53 designed to move, against the action exerted by flexible means 54, inside respective seats 55 formed radially on the outer side of cup shaped body 41 the said push rods 53 being designed to cooperate with edge 51 so as to impede rotation of body 41 round pin 42 and selectively position the said body 41 in stable manner in a number of different angular positions, via insertion of one of the said push rods 53 inside respective recesses 56 formed on the said shaped edge 51 on a first pair of inclined surfaces 52 with which the said push rod 53 cooperates. A second pair of inclined surfaces 52 cooperates with the other push rod 53 for simply contrasting, in flexible manner, rotation of body 41.Rotation of end 7 on pin 40, in relation to body 41, is contrasted by a further pair of push rods 60 located on end 7 itself and housed, in mobile manner against the action of respective springs 61, inside a pair of opposite coaxial holes 62 formed in end 7 parallel with pin 40, the said push rods 60 cooperating with a respective pair of facing V shaped cavities 65 defining respective opposite inclined surfaces for contrasting the said rotation of lever 2 on pin 40 by pushing rods 60 inside holes 62 against the action exert ed by springs 61. Half casings 16 and 18 are also provid ed with through holes 70 for accommodating respective known types of assembly screws not shown for securing the said half casings 16 and 18 together so as to form case 14. As the control box fitted inside the free seat 6 on supporting body 4 is identical to the aforementioned box 5, only a detail on the said box, consisting of bottom half casing 16a Fig.2 is illustrated herein. The said half casing 16a is essentially identical to half casing 16, the only difference being that it contains a printed circuit 28a having tracks 30 of a different shape and number. Any details similar or identical to those already described are shown using the same numbers. The said control box of which half casing 16a forms part may obviously be employed, for example, for controlling the direction indicators on the vehicle.operation and assembly of control 1 according to the present invention will be clear from the foregoing description. The special design of the structure on control 1 provides for troublefree, on line assembly of supporting body 4 on to the vehicle, and for separate off line assembly, in appropriate assembly bays, of all the mechanical and electrical components in box 5 inside respective half casings 16 and 18. In more detail, all the electric components, connectors 15 and pad 35 are fitted on to printed circuit 28 which, together with switch box 25, also pre assembled in a separate assembly bay, is then inserted inside half casing 16.At the same time, lever 2 is fitted on to cup shaped body 41 which is then fitted on to half casing 18 together with plate 50 and after first inserting, inside the said half casing 18, push rods 53 and respective springs 55 and, on to end 7, push rods 60 and respective springs 61. The two preassembled half casings are then put together and secured by through screws to form box 5 which is thus fully operative and may, if necessary, be tested off the line by connecting connectors 15 to an appropriate test circuit by inserting a plug inside receptacle 22. Box 5 so formed and tested is then sent on to the assembly line where it may simply be slid inside respective seat 6 and locked, for example, by means of flexible tabs 71 Fig.3 formed on either of half casings 16 and 18, and or by means of screws not shown fitted externally on to cup shaped members 12.Finally, after being secured inside seats 6, the said boxes 5 are connected to the electric circuit on the vehicle by inserting inside seats 22 connecting devices designed to cooperate with connectors 15. Lever 2 may thus be operated so as to turn round pin 40 and so displace rod 26 and, consequent ly, switch box 25. Alternatively, cup shaped body 41, with which lever 2 is fitted integral, may be turned so as to displace pad 35 via pin 39 which, when the two half casings 16 and 18 are assembled, engages a corresponding recess 46 on body 41 so as to switch fixed contact 32. By appropriately designing and selecting an appropriate number of conducting tracks 30 on printed circuits 28, box 5 may obviously be employed for controlling any one or more of the indicating. and or operat ing devices on the vehicle. The advantages afforded by the control according to the present invention, as compared with known types of controls, will be clear from the foregoing description. In particular, it provides for extensive use of pre assembly bays, possibly employing robot facilities, as well as for fast assembly and removal on and off the vehicle of the most complex part of the control, i.e. boxes 5. The possibility of removing defective parts rapidly off the vehicle, without affecting the other parts on the control, obviously affords enormous advantages in terms of maintenance.To those skilled in the art it will be clear that changes may be made to the control as described herein without, however, deaprting from the scope of the present invention.
