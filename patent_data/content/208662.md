# Process for manufacturing r norcarnitine tert butyl ester.

## Abstract
Tert butyl 4 dimethylamino 3 R hydroxy butyrate R norcarnitine tert butyl ester , a versatile intermediate, useful in the preparation of R carnitine and derivatives thereof e.g. alkanoyl R carnitines is prepared by converting tert butyl 4 chloroacetoacetate in the presence of a mutant of Saccharomices cerevisiae ATCC 26403 to tert butyl 4 chloro 3 R hydroxy butyrate which is epoxidized with silver oxide in a nitrogen atmosphere. The epoxide, which keeps the desired R configuration, is then converted into the final com pound by aminating it with dimethylamine in a lower alkanol.

## Description
The present invention relates to a process for preparingR norcarnitine tert butyl ester Tert butyl 4 dimethylamino 3 R hydroxy butyrate having formula I EMI1.1 I is a useful intermediate in the preparation of R carnitine and R carnitine derivatives, such as alkanoylR carnitines, whose various therapeutical utilizations are known. Tert butyl ester ofnorcarnitine contains an asymmetric carbon atom. This molecular species thus exists in two optically active stereoisomer forms, the R stereoisomer its configuration is illustrated by formula I and the S stereoisomer its configuration is illustrated by formula I , and in the optically inactive R,S racemic mixture. Recently, particular emphasis has been placed on the importance of utilizing for therapeutical applications R carnitine and R carnitine derivatives exclusively, carefully avoiding the presence of the S stereoisomer. This latter exerts, in fact, an inhibiting action on the R stereoisomer which is on the other hand the naturally occurring carnitine found in muscular tissues and myocardium of mammals . In addition to both chemical and microbiological methods for resolving racemic mixtures which aim at isolating the desired R stercoisomcr from the S stereoisomer, cheniical and microbiological methods have been developed for selectively synthesizing a carnitine precursor which already presents the desired R configuration, typical of the natural carnitine. In the Italian patent application 48504A84 filed on July 4,1984 in the name of the same applicant. of the present application see also the corresponding EP application 0169176 , tert butyl ester of R,S norcarnitine and a process for its preparation have been disclosed and claimed. This product or, optionally, a derivative thereof must, therefore, be subjected to the above mentioned resolution procedures. in order to isolate the desired R isomer from the S isomer. The process of this invention allows R norcarnitine tert butyl.ester to be obtained directly and selectively,without attendant formation of the S isomer. Therefore, compound I shall be directly utilized for producing R carnitine or any derivative thereof. The process of the present invention is illustrated by the following reaction scheme EMI3.1 More.specifically, the process of the present invention comprises the steps of 1 converting tert butyl4 .chloro acetoacetate II into tert butyl 4 chloro 3 R hydroxy butyrate III in the presence of Saccharomices cerevisiae ATCC 26403 2 converting III into the corresponding epoxide IV , by keeping a reaction mixture comprising a solution of III in an anhydrous organic solvent and silver oxide, at molar ratio III Ag2O 1 3, in an atmosphere of a dry inert gas, at the reflux temperature of the mixture, for 40 48 hours 3 reacting a solution of the epoxide IV in a lower alkanol with a solution of dimethylanine in a lower alkancl. at molar ratio IV dimethylamine comprised between 1 09 and 1 1.1, keeping the reaction mixture at about 5 300C for about 3 8 hours in an atmosphere of inert gas, thus obtaining I and 4 isolating I from the reaction mixture of step 3 by concentrating the mixture under vacuum and taking up the residue with a water insoluble solvent, extracting with a diluted acid solution and then alkalinizing to pH about 12, dehydrating the resulting organic phase and removing the organic solvent via distillation under reduced pressure. Preferably, the organic solvent of step 2 is. selected from dimethoxyethane and ethyl ether,the lower alka no.l. of step 3 is methanol and the water insoluble organic solvent of step 4 is selected from ethyl ether and ethyl acetate.
