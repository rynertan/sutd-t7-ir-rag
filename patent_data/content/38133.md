# Method of manufacturing semiconductor devices with submicron lines.

## Abstract
A short channel insulated gate field effect transistor, suitable for use in high speed integrated circuits, is described as being manufactured by a self aligned pro cess in which the gate electrode is formed by a selective etching technique. In practising the process, an etch limiting element is laterally diffused from an edge of an adjacent solid source 20 e.g., a doped oxide layer, into a polycrystalline silicon layer 32 in contact with that edge forming a doped region 34, 36 which is left behind as the gate electrode after subsequent etching steps which remove the undoped polysilicon, the source layer 20 and other oxide layers 18, 22, 30 . A portion of the solid source 20 may serve as a mask in another step of the process to define the length of a drain extension region.
