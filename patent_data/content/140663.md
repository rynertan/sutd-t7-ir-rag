# Optical scanning system for laser treatment of electrical steel and the like.

## Abstract
Apparatus for scanning a laser beam across a moving strip of material. The strip is temporarily shaped by formed roll ers to a concave shape to maintain a constant focus of the la ser beam on the strip surface. The scanning assembly includes a mounting platform rotatable about a central axis. Mounted on the platform are a reflecting mirror, an optical element posi tioned within the path of the laser beam between the laser transmitter and the mirror, and a final focusing lens for focus ing the laser beam reflected from the mirror to a relatively small spot on the object. As the optics rotate with the platform, the beam emerging from the final lens is scanned across the sur face of the strip. The optical element of the rotating platform first encountered by the laser beam may be a plano convex lens, a plane reflecting mirror or a beam splitter. Multiple lasers and optics assemblies may also be utilized. The final focusing lens may comprise multiple lens assemblies or a cylindrical lens for producing an elliptically shaped spot on the strip sur face. The invention also finds utility in other applications where a laser beam must be scanned across the surface of an object.
