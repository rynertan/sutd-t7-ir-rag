# Latch assembly.

## Abstract
An improved latch assembly adapted particularly for use in the electronics or communications industry to retain a plug member 11 in electrical engagement with a receptacle 40 and prevent relative movement therebetween in a latching direc tion. The latch assembly includes a first latch member 24 adapted for limited movement in a direction generally parallel to the latching direction between first and second positions and for limited movement in a direction generally perpendicular to the latching direction between engaged and disengaged positions. The latch assembly further includes a spring member 19 for biasing the first latch member 24 toward an engaged position, a stop member 35 for limiting the movement of the first latch member 24 in a direction opposite the latching direction and a guide member 35 for causing movement of and guiding the first latch member 24 toward its second position during move ment of the latch member 24 toward its disengaged position.
