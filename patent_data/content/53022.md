# Rubbery Polymer compositions with improved adhesion.

## Abstract
Rubbery polymer compositions. e.g. based on chloro butyl rubber, having improved adhesion to mineral subs trates such as glass or metal, are produced by a stepwise reaction sequence. In a first stage the rubbery polymer is reacted with a reactive silane such as an amino trialkoxy silane, in a second stage the product is mixed with an epoxy resin, and in a third stage a further amount of reactive silane is reacted with the epoxy containing compound.
