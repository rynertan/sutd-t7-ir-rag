# Apparatus and method for mixing a plurality of substances.

## Abstract
A transportable apparatus for controlling the production of a mixture of a fluid supplied at 32 and a plurality of additives from tanks e.g. 44, 46 utilizes a unified control panel on an operator s platform 54 having all of the necessary controls compactly contained in a single housing 56 for providing both automatic and manual control of each of the additive channels through which the additives are mixed with the primary fluid, for flow into a holding tank 16 . The control of each additive channel is achieved through a software controlled algorithm by which errors are only incrementally, rather than totally, applied to prior drive signals at any one time.
