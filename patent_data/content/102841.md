# Shelf assembly.

## Abstract
A shelf assembly including apparatus 22 for interlock ing upright and transverse members 12, 14 without the need for separate fasteners or supplemental cross bracing to achieve structural rigidity. The interlocking apparatus in cludes connectors formed near the ends of the transverse beams, each connector comprising a lug 40 spaced from a side panel 30 of the transverse member 14 by a keyed pedestal 42 . The pedestal is defined by spaced lug support ing legs 44, 46 , joined by a curved interconnecting wall 48 . The uprights include pairs of apertures 22 each defined by an upper slot segment 50a having a lug clearance notch 52 and a lower slot segment having a narrowing transverse dimension. The upright and transverse members are inter locked by inserting the connectors of a transverse beam into the upper slot segments 50a and then moving the trans verse beam downwardly so that the lug overlies a face 30b of the upright and the keyed pedestal coengages the edges of the lower slot segment at three areas 62a, 62b, 62c for a given length.
