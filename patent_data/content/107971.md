# Edge trimming and scrap disposal system.

## Abstract
A system for trimming the edges of a metal strip and chopping the trimmed metal into small pieces. The system includes an automatic twin edge trimmer, two chutes fas tened to the trimmer and a scrap chopper. The twin edge trimmer comprises two sets of coacting rotary sitter knives, one set for each edge of the strip and a backup roll adjacent to each knife in order to hold the strip flat while the cuts are being made. There are two mirror image chutes, each of which receives trimmings from one edge of the strip. Each chute is shaped and fastened to the trimmer in such a way that it completely surrounds the trim cut by the edge trimmer. The chutes are inclined downwardly at an angle with respect to the plane of the strip that matches that of the trimmings. The scrap chopper receives trim from both chutes and cuts the trim into small pieces. One edge trimmer is mounted for lateral movement with respect to the strip during trimming to provide an on the fly adlustment in the width of the strip thus trimmed.
