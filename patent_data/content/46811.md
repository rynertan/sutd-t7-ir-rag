# PROCESS FOR RECOVERING CO RICH OFF GAS IN METAL SMELTING.

## Abstract
A process for recovering CO, as an energy source, contained in an off gas discharged from a metal smelting plant by raising the CO concentration in the off gas, which comprises blowing the off gas together with limestone dust or particles through the tuyere into molten iron containing a definite concentration of carbon to react COâ‚‚ produced by decomposition of the limestone with carbon in the molten iron, and recovering the thus produced CO.
